written by paul thomas anderson a young man freddie sutton early s speaks to a what are you going to do when you get out of here
youre going to have to wear a belt for six months maybe a year
what kind of belt
a surgical belt
you wont be able to do very heavy lifting

but you spend time outdoors
what do you do
you didnt have very much on you when you were admitted

quick on your feet you like to drink
its a weakness
but i like it
i know what the other is too

no one ever made money chasing girls
this tatoos my auntie
my auntie bertha she raised me
but that doesnt mean i dont have a weakness
i tried that it didnt work
whyd you leave
sometimes my hypos get the best of me i really feel like walking into the street and hitting peoples hats off
thats how you end up like this
with a burst appendix
thats when i know its time to get to the sea
what kind of belt
a medical belt
similar for lifting
youre going to need some money

and your belt
i intend to do that
you saying you have a job for me
as an orderly
you couldnt be an orderly its too much lifting and a lot of things youd have to learn
but maybe you could run an elevator something of that sort
i want to get out of here but i also like it here

freddie walks into the alley stuffing some money in his pockets hes followed by a figure
freddie realizes stops spins around and pulls knife you come any closer and ill slice your im not after your dough i just want to talk with you you can

he looks from behind the old camera getting reactions
we see the taken
he interacts with them all
camera leads around a beautiful young woman names donna who is modelling a fur coat for the female customers in the cosmetics section
she catches the eye of freddie watching her
she moves around snaking towards him
cameraa leads him out of the photo department and towards her and they meet in the
hand made imported

theres a buzz of getting ready around the ship also a minor cocktail party in progress
light music playing from the ship
deckhands preparing to ship out etc
freddie approaches the gang plank
no one is there to guard it
he walks straight up the gang plank and gets on board the ship
camera follows him around
no one seems to notice or care
he goes down below

he was working on a book that showed how the russians used narcosynthesis and physical torture and how it worked as it did
that was interrupted
he had a technology oh psychological warfare to present to the defense department

people that are greedy
thats whats so nice about being at sea

freddies face listening
mary sue leans over and whispers do you understand whats happening
she hold her pregnant stomach we record everything
freddie moves around camera follows him collecting various supplies to start making a home made potion of booze
potatoes paint thinner oranges yeast
tbd other contents of the ship that could go into a recipe hes set up in an area of the ship to start distilling booze from the found ingredients on
watch hold this
the bartender follower is here to give him some help
bartender telling him how came to the cause here
he slips a pair of headphones on takes a seat and listens
this is a recording of a live lecture by master someone came up to me the other day and i had to say
i had to correct him
he said i heard the cause can fix me
i looked down at him and hed lost his legs
hes sitting in a wheel chair and had no legs to speak of
i said we can do very many things sir

this is how rumors get started
lets talk about what we can do
freddie looks around and watches all the students on their headphones
he tries to flirt and make eye contact with all the women
when did you decide you had limited potentials and capabilities
youve forgotten that this is all just a dirty old game that you created
an aid female s comes over how you doing

he leaves she watches him go
he puts the booze into mason jars
freddie pours the liquid into two glasses
we hear the party outside the room from upstairs
master examines whats in it
drink just a little
its very strong
the good stuff takes time
and theres secrets in good liquor
this is just booze for now
how are you feeling freddie

master smiles excited moves to an old tape recorder points a microphones towards freddie looks over some papers
are you ready
he flips the tape recorder on
master smiles reads say your name
say it again
say it again
might as well say it one more time just to make sure you know who you are
do you ever make thoughtless remarks
i usually put some thought into them
do you browse though railway timetables just for pleasure
do you get occasional twitches of you muscles when there is no logical reason for it
flutters around goofy only on my good days
do past failures bother you
do past failures bother you
do past failures bother you
some dice games i was in he he
so past failures bother you
i dont know

no not really
is your life a constant struggle for survival
would you rather give orders than take them
are you often impulsive in you behaviour
do other people interest you very much
not really girls

are you likely to be jealous

i dont know
dont care about science
do you rarely suspect the actions of others
i dont understand
yes you do
i suspect people
most people are asss anyway
are you usually truthful to others
i dont know
are your actions considered unpredictable by other people
freddie seems to think about this questions seriously then out of the pause and out of the blue he hows that
laughs hysterically silly
its good to laugh in processing
sometimes we forget
master reaches down brings the microphone to his mouth freddie sutton test session

freddie carries over an old reel to reel tape player sets it on a coffee table in front of him
as you can see ive brought props
showmans trade secrets
he he he more laughter
let me just listen to this tape
he picks up the tape and lifts it to his ear
he wiggles it around next to his ear
cant hear anything
but theres sound on here no
sound to be found
he puts the tape reels onto the player
this should do it
he flips the switch
can thear anything
there are sounds on this tape but i cant hear
how about this
he continues this
he plugs the speakers in
nothing again and again
well what do we have
we have the high fidelity audio tape we have speakers and yet
just a moment
he turns the machine on
this should do it
seems were out of pieces
everyone laughs nervously
i know theres sound on that tape
he plugs the power cord into the wall
it crackles and sound pours out
its masters voice
our life has never stopped and always been
all of the recordings of our lifetimes that we have lived are available to us
music starts to play
gentle piano music
master turns the volume down on the reel to reel speaks live to the everythings there isnt it
on the tape
sure is we just need to get it working with all the other pieces in synch ro nization
no good if its not plugged into the wall
cant hear it
but the sounds are still there
no good if those speakers arent there
cant hear it
but that doesnt mean its not there does it
that flimsy little piece of tape is just nothin without all the other equipment lined up properly isnt it
we can access the past traumas and seeds that abberate us in present time and once we access them we challenge them and throw them away
previously id established how to access these aberrations and painful memories to pre birth cellular times
but the new studies prove there is a time beyond that
the whole of time with which we are now working
at last count perhaps sixty seven trillion years our studies show
besides the everyday struggles of how we become better more able more productive homo sapiens the uses for this new science is the location and removal of certain leukemias apathies
depressives perverts stuttering neuroses ulcers arthritis and asthmas
this is the province and science of cause
if youll forgive me i must sit down
perhaps youve taken notice of my leg injury and limp damndest thing
you see it happens every time i come to manhattan island its a wound ive never conquered and ill tell you how i found out about because i never knew
what in the h was happening
well i did some processing to find out
took mary sue to ay me down and lead me back
we processed over three hours
and something came up
it was this i lived a life before and suffered a great injury
it was just around
a great number and year
significant as the creation
year of the new york city sewer system if im not wrong
i was a thief and criminal working late into the night robbing a bank in the western side of the island
the crime was committed with a revolver in hand
my accomplices and i made it clear across town when we were ambushed by the local authorities
but i made a slip away
a digression into the under constructed sewer system
it was here that i could no be found or so my thinking went
all my confidence and all my arrogance was brought upon me
full in the face
for i was nose to nose with a twenty five foot alligator in the new york city sewer
what a scare i was in for
now if youve veer seen the snap
of a gator youll remember the fear
you see this being an island and in those days more inhabited by creature than man why wouldnt i meet such a beast
in my evasion i dropped the gold
the money id stolen in my getaway
not dropped but stuffed in a newly cemented drain hole just around th street
present day harlem county i believe today
i stuffed it and made a getaway from both man and beast azshattered my knee in five different places turned into a piece of glass
woke up early in the morning somewhere near the present day times square which was nothing more than a farm
quite a farm
but thats another story
so what does this say
injuries stay with us dont they
they sure do
hows it gonna go away
howm i gonna fix this knee
how are any of us going to get better
we must process the whole of time
this life and pre natal cellular processing is not enough
we have lived many many many lives
so anybody tat is not processing the whole of time is doing a disservice to man and will not get better
i cannot put it more simply
and as for me now i just need to find the time away from all of my writing to go back down and do it so i dont walk around
with the darndest limp everytime i come to town
this story is greeted
with equal parts excitement complete confusion
purcell slightly nervous
master and a socialite woman s he has her lay down on a love seat what is your name
are you sure you havent lived here before
i dont know
whats your name
are you sure
freddie goes lurking around slinks in and out of some rooms
he goes into the bedroom steals some jewelry
master has finished his demonstration and is opening it up for questions discussions
an older man mr
john more s scholarly wearing a prominent handkerchief stands up to speak throughout this another older woman has a terrible cough from the back of the room
some of this seems quite like hypnosis is it not
oh no this is funny
its quite the reverse
man is hypnotized
what we do is un hypnotize him of the shackles
allow him to raise his awareness and iq
what is the difference between this and psychotherapy
they are very different
psychoanalysis they lay back
no no no
dont associate us with such people
thats terrible he he why thats a bad manner dont you know
i mean at that business about sex and all that
thats for the neurotic or the person who is insane or something like that
thats nothing to do with us
thats for the fortunate few who can afford the fees
but some of this does in fact seem to share quite a lot with dr
freud and modern psychotherapy does it not
no it does not
this is an exact science you see
comparable to physics or chemistry but simpler
herr freud had his chance and contributed some very workable data but in the end he failed
so thats that
and how long does this take
but it can be quite fast
or it can take some time
sometimes less than hours
and youre saying that these methods can cure leukemia according to your book and what youve just said
some forms of leukemia cases tested
those are the results
you can understand scepticism can you not
oh yes of course yes
and this is to be expected and welcome
for without it wed be positives with no negatives therefore zero
we must have it
are you a religious people
we are not incorporated as a religion no
but remember this that religion has come uniformly from a philosophy
philosophy is senior to religion
you could call us a religion of religions
are you saying then that any religion is rather narrow in its outlook
no no no
i have no quarrel with mans beliefs but religions in general can be pre occupied with a god or idol or something of some such nature who is merely trying
to fill the universe with a lot of little replicas of himself we are trying to free the individual not bend to a will of a god you see
and if our teachings can reconcile these views it would be doing a great service to do you think it can
i not only think it can i know it does
you mentioned good science and what it does
but doesnt that by definition allow for more than one opinion
which is why our gathering of day ta is so far reaching otherwise you merely have the will of one man which is the basis of cult is it not
tis tis indeed
thankfully we are all of us working at break neck speeds and in unison towards catching the minds fatal flaws and correcting it back to its original state of perfect
whilst righting civilization
i must say that i find it quite i can answer for myself
my name is john more
if youre not allowing some sort of discussion regarding your beliefs im sorry if youre unwilling to defend your beliefs in any kind of rational
the woman thats been coughing cannot stop mrs
purcell is shocked humiliated everything crumbles
this isnt a lecture hall this is mrs
purcells home theyre all leaving
stuffed in the elevator master fuming
master gets on his harley and peels off into the night
hold the shot everyone else gets into their sedans
up ahead master wipes out lays the bike down in the middle of park avenue
he leaves it the sedans pull up he gets in
an aid goes to the bike and picks it up
master is still fuming ranting and raving mary sue is here with him
we hear master from the next room everyone in here listens hangs their faces
this city is just noise
just noise and bad living
i know this place
i know its rotten secrets
he sips some of his booze form the flask gets a real surly look on his face
val gets up and leaves the hotel room
fred die watches him go
everyone seems resigned sleepy
freddie snaps and says you have the names and information of the guests at this ladys party
freddie looks at clark the new son in law
elizabeth looks up
youre coming with me
i need some help and you wanna make a good show no
whos paying your way
clark looks to elizabeth who gives a look that says hes right
bill white turns on the lights takes freddie and clark over to his desk
they get the address and info
i dont think this is right to do you dont know what were going to do so dont bother thinking about this anymore
camera with freddie and clark as they walk out of the hotel and into the streets of new york you have any money on you
freddie and clark walking down the street
they where are you from clark
im from there
master and headquarters there for a year
howd you see them
i read the first book
i worked at boeing for three years
when i read the book i didnt want to waste my time there anymore
i came to help the cause
what did it say
im skeptical of everything
always have been
all i know is i used to not be able to sleep
now i sleep through the night
i spent months at the presidio with every army head shrinker they had and not one did as much for me as book one did
thats simple arithmetic to me
and i met elizabeth so
he changes things
and the research is hard to keep up with
none of this is done by a long shot
sometimes its easy to get lost
hes a very smart man
i can tell that
i dont understand myself but more time with it and i might i feel better i feel like ive more to do with my life since i met him
and i just met him
so that cant be a bad thing right
outside an old apartment building
freddie buzzes the buzzer
i have a delivery for mr
late night delivery
i need a signature
yes yes of course
john more says to his wife
must be urgent from the university
he gets a robe on makes the walk down the hallway he comes to the door
freddie smashes it down
clark is here and watches does nothing
freddie drags him along the floor camera moves over and sees mrs
freddie takes care of them both
ends up tying them up
scaring them etc
takes some valuables finds freddie gets down into his face and says they run out
clark having his first beer
they are watching a few very sexy burlesque dancers
freddie has his eye on one in particular
she is doing a naked tap dance in the center of the room
clark speaks you know
at first there were rumors going around about you
what about me
well when you first were found on board
people were saying you were looking for split saber
that you were trying to steal the split saber if it was on board
the split saber
i dont understand what youre saying
the split saber
i still dont understand what youre saying
the darkest cloud
aka dual saber
or the split saber
its what started all this
hed been in operation in army hospital
he died on the table
gone for seven minutes
but and in a storm of vision and creative output from this experience he wrote the split saber aka the darkest cloud
whoever read it
either went insane or committed suicide
twelve people read it
six dead four disappeared
the last time anyone saw it
was his last publisher in new york
master walked into the office to find out what the reaction was the publisher called for the reader the reader came in with the manuscript
threw it on the table
and flung himself out of the skyscraper window
master took the book and hid it where no one could get to it
its inside this book all the history
all the facts
all too dangerous
he re wrote it using what he could as the basis for what we are able to accept and learn today
thats book one that we all study and know
but the real stuff
the things at the center
are still too dangerous
they kill cure any man who reads it
its passing through the jaws of resistance
its the truth about all this
the book is protected and hidden
no one knows where but master
the truth about all what
life on this planet
freddie stares at him
then takes a good long look at the burlesque dancer and her breasts
then back to clark what is something like that worth
he said he was once offered dollars for it
but the price is
how could you figure out what the price is on something like that
incalculable by man
where is it
its locked away in a vault somewhere
i dont know
no one knows for sure
some say phoenix or the desert outside los angeles
its held back until the time is right
or in case its needed
needed for what
i dont know
how do you know about this
everyone knows about it
its the original text
freddie just sort of looks then looks back to the naked the dancer ellen has joined them
ad libbed flirtations innuendo etc
clark watching freddie
freddie gets severely drunk he makes a drunken appeal for her to come to the cause h
for help in her life theres something
something that can hepp you
if you need helpp in yer life
where is it
the martinique hotel
thizz helped me
it can help you
you can go back in time and learn thingz
he is about to say
but he passes out face first on the table
clark is dragging freddie down the hall passed out
he gets him to the room
opens the door
pulls him inside
freddie wakes up
takes him a good long time
camera just watches
he soaks everything in thinks thinks thinks
he puts the pieces together of last night an the last few days
he looks down at something in his hands quietly inspects it looks up freddie is here hes given him the handkerchief
hold between them then what is it

master collects his notebooks
val has a habit of finding trouble
i sometimes wonder what danger a man could get himself into this island

with a casualness and delicacy
watchful eyes to make sure trouble doesnt come
or that come doesnt trouble
my little soldier

and report back to me
freddie is getting into his duffle bag re filling the booze supply

camera looks up the spiral stairwell of the hotel
its the end of the evening lectures
we see val walking down the steps
moments later about three floors above freddie pokes his head over sees val and starts to follow
val moves past followers who are wrapping up for the evening discussing smoking cigs exchanging ideas etc
and out into the new york city streets
val walks into a coffee shop takes a seat in a booth and orders some coffee
freddie stands across the street and watches val
freddie buys hot dog from a hot dog vendor
stands and waits
and watches val sit alone
after a few minutes
freddie sees something a young group enters the coffee shop
its bill white his girlfriend peggy and two male new york followers jim lehr and fred fritz
theyre here to meet val
they join him sit down speak
order cokes coffee smoke cigs etc
freddie watching all this from across the street
val is answering their questions speaking with some authority about something etc
freddie sizes up the situation and what this meeting might mean
he turns this all around in his head for a while
and after enough of it gets restless
he moves to a phone booth
makes a call
he hears a young male voice say hello
are you home
im comin over he hangs up
he looks back across the street at the group in the coffee shop
and walks away off down the street
freddie walks up some stairs at the top of the stairs is his year old cousin bob

i heard about a load of money and jewels that are hidden in a sewer wall up near harlem
a long time ago
with crocodiles that live down there and protect it
i heard about that

the five boys including freddie and bob get out of an old car
they find and lift a manhole cover and head down with flashlights and a sledgehammer theyre drunk and bring more booze down with them two girls

they all climb down
rats and sewage
flashlight shining they come to an intersection lets go this way and that way come with me bob follows freddie the rest go the other way various angles watching them

theres nothing here

moving towards the intersection to meet with the boys
suddenly he stops bends down
freddie in kneeling down aims the bob is stunned
the boys run over look down at the jewels

bob and the other boys passed out on couches and floor
freddie is awake looking around at some photos and things
freddie leaves him the jewels takes a couple family photos with him and writes a note that says and leaves
freddie comes up to his room and hears from the hallway typing
he opens up and comes in
master is here in his underwear typing away
he barely takes notice of freddie keeps typing
freddie gets into the bed
master stops for one moment looks at him sees his condition goes back to typing
this city can be cold and unforgiving to new ideas
philadelphia is the city of brotherly love
weve had miraculous results with the textbooks and lecture tapes
helen sullivan sweet woman early s is speaking
if you come we can guarantee an audience of one hundred people three nights a week and six afternoons a week
we have an engineer from western electric who is willing to record all of the lectures for free onto high fidelity audio tapes
perhaps these can be used for sale
i assure you you will find a very open city
people with open minds
we keep the bad ones out
i know that new sciences can attract quacks and some strange people but keep them all away
master and mary sue listening to helen
norman conrad stands to the side
you are very right about one thing helen this is a dirty city of nothing good
everyone looks around at each other
a woman starts singing
everyone is getting into cars
the whole entourage
freddie at the center of it
master comes out of the hotel quickly and into the sedan that waits
bill white is there to say good bye and is all but ignored by master and mary sue
the swirl of getting bags kids and bodies into sedans
val gets in one car
freddie gets behind the wheel of another
and they drive off
freddie is driving
master is asleep in the passenger seat
mary sue is breast feeding in the back
she looks at freddie in the rear view you see anything last night
considers this a moment
how does that happen
lost em in the streets
or maybe you drink too much and you get cross eyed
a party is in progress at helen sullivans home which has been converted into a study college
its beautiful large well appointed home
a woman joan banks is singing elizabeth is playing piano
everyone is here for a welcoming party good time cocktails snacks etc
everyone applauds laughs
master is smitten standing ovation
master walks over to joan to shake her hand
she whispers to him what do you do with a student who keeps dreaming she is in bed with you
get thee behind me and push
piano starts in again
everyone is relaxed sitting around
new faces joan and helen sit close to master
a woman is speaking stories of cause success shes had at her branch in minneapolis a once a month meeting
this last saturday night we had a chiropractor
and he spoke about handwriting analysis
master is distracted
as he listens he rubs his nose and pulls his ear catching freddies eye
as we hear the woman ramble on freddie gets his flask moves discreetly to get a glass make a drink and brings it to master
this is unnoticed by everyone but mary sue
the woman cheers to that
everyone raises their glasses and drinks
master downs his new drink
then master gently protificates
something that joseph smith had right the breeding and the development of the group
doubled tripled with certain
a certain marital structure
something to look at deeply for a growth
mary sue looks at him
joan looks at him
helen looks at him
freddie looks at all of it
helens husband john looks confused
the consideration of celestial marriage
these cannot be overlooked so quickly
think of the speed at which a movement could grow
met with a strange silence
mary sue moves to get up
master changes the topic slightly
to live in the days of six shooters and open frontier thats what id like
a criminal of the highest lineage once told me he met a boy named buckskin joe
he keeps talking
its the next morning
master is getting ready dressing in the bathroom getting ready for his lectures
mary sue comes in from behind him
she hugs him from behind
she looks at him in the mirror he looks at her
she reaches around gets into his pants you can do

he gets up close to freddie whispers in his ear whatever we say is undoubtably being monitored
speak in whispers
i dont want to talk to you right now
this is fbi work russians maybe
too much work for the
youre fear of capture and imprisonment is an implant from millions of years ago
an invader force played games with your spirit as it
moved from one body to the next free for a moment it was free and the invader force captured it spun you around in a device not unlike a grinder
and hit you with waves of high wattage electrical impulses quaver bolts to damage you
the impulse lodges and plants the push pull instinct dumped in scalding hot water then freezing cold a control mechanism any legal action a summons to court the sight of
a police officer exposes a glandular reaction and anxiety wave of the highest order the mere threat of arrest will make a psychotic breakdown
this happened to you and you are free to stop it
their game and implants are no match for you
laugh in their face
laugh at it
these triggers are useless now
you created them so you can destroy them
master pulls away
freddie looks at him
i dont have any opinions
im giving you facts
