written by paul haggis august no sound
we are in a speeding suv
the passenger lara unsnaps her seat belt and reaches for the door handle
the driver john sees her door open and dives to grab her
the suv spins horns blare tires screech cars swerve to avoid collision
we arent sure what is happening but we know something has gone terribly wrong
cut to black
read two couples sit at a table picking at dessert john and lara brennan on one side mick and erit on the other
john is attractive in a worn kind of way but has the eyes of a kid with a discipline problem
you have to really know him to understand if he is mocking you or agreeing with you
he is a master of irony and has a true enjoyment of the absurd
lara looks beautiful even in her wrinkled suit
she appears to have had a hard day at the office
shes been drinking at dinner it hasnt eased her nerves
johns good looking brother mick boasts his blue collar roots and a gorgeous if slightly trashy girlfriend erit who isnt ashamed of her body or sharing her opinions
john and mick are laughing
lara puts cash on the tray beside micks credit card
you know what
if you were smart you would stop talking right now
i just know that women should never work for women
john laughs and applauds
mick buries his head
how can you say that
theyre always threatened
especially if youre beautiful and theyre not
erit you are so full of shit
so your boss isnt threatened by you
because shes a bitch
as john and mick laugh not because shes a woman
and you would describe her as attractive
that has nothing to do with it
and there is my answer
either of you like another drink
lara shoots john a burning look as erit builds on her victory
women should work under men men under women
egging her on but men under men
thats fine too
the men burst into laughter theyre used to it
why are you laughing
re erit i dont know bro but i think id rather work under you than her
insulted shoots back oh please id rather work under him too
that was a dig at mick but lara is primed for a fight
youd rather work under john
you have a problem with that too
no why would i have a problem with your little sexual innuendo
what is up your ass tonight
mick throws john a this is all your fault and now it is going to explode look
john feigns complete innocence
so i shouldnt take offense that youre coming on to my husband right in front of me
claws out now lara if i wanted your husband i would have him
you couldnt possibly show him more of your tits
the men are on their feet before blows are exchanged
you know what your problem is
that was a great meal
mick and erit head toward micks sporty pickup
john and lara step into foreground lara still fuming
she is completely full of shit
dont try and agree with me now
you know what
i dont even believe she is in the dental profession
lara knows this game he is trying to get her out of her black mood and she has no intention of letting him
i bet she cant even spell anesthesiologist
womans a complete fraud
we went to her office party idiot
i think she hit on me that night too
lara opens the back door of their black prius and tosses in the raincoat she was carrying
they climb in under
you are completely delusional
she wasnt even hitting on you in there i just dont like her
people who look like that should not be allowed anywhere near oral surgery
she feels a smile coming to her lips and tries to force it away
you are such an asshole
youre in the chair trying to stay calm how are you supposed to do that with those things hanging over your she cant stand how attractive he is in this
moment she stops him short by kissing him passionately
his hands slip under her blouse she tugs at his sweater
someones going to her hand goes to his pants
he yanks at the seat lever and it goes crashing back lara landing atop him
after a moment he sits up quickly and pushes down the visors
she laughs and kisses him and they disappear into each other
lara and john enter lara carrying her raincoat her hair sticking up in the back johns shirt untucked
jenna the teenage baby sitter sees right through them
did he cry
only when i dropped him down the stairs
lara shoots her a look hangs up her coat and exits upstairs
she peeks in her sons room sees him sleeping soundly
lara comes down to find john paying jenna
john nods for her to check the mirror
she tugs at the knot in her hair
see you next weekend
lara shows him that his sweater is inside out
john reacts oh god
laras smile broadens she kisses him
he pins her to the wall and they start all over again
he feels for the light switch
he finds it we cut to black
lara wakes troubled
its the middle of the night
lara finds lukes window closed but unlocked
she locks it and looks out
satisfied she sits and watches her son sleep
three year old luke holds a knife and fork as he sits at the table watching his dad cut up his pancakes
okay your turn
luke skewers a piece with his fork
lara passes hustling to get to work
very good very good
luke puts it in his mouth
no no no you feed me
to lara your son is hopeless
lara grabs her phone and leans over them to take a photo
squeeze in tight
you cant do this every morning
it is way too corny
its just until hes eighteen
lara kisses john puts an alien looking electric toothbrush on the table walks off to pour coffee to go
examining it sweetie you have to stop believing everything you read in a catalogue
you hate brushing your teeth this one brushes them in thirty seconds
as if stung i love brushing my teeth
to luke the lies your mother tells
ignoring him whens your last class
three and i have papers to grade
can you pick up luke
after yesterday i probably dont have a job anyway
do you think it was wrong to call her a useless cow
bosses admire that kind of frank exchange
pulls note off fridge did you call your father
heading for bathroom when
yesterday for his birthday
lara puts her foot up and jabs herself with insulin
i sent him flowers and a handmade card
youre completely impossible
did you notice what i got for my birthday this year
mom said happy birthday and my father went made me tear up
lara returns trying hard not to smile
ever think that someone has to be the bigger person here
to luke remember this for the custody hearing how mommy is always scolding daddy
how are you going to feel if luke grows up and doesnt call you
lara cant keep a straight face and heads to the foyer
now shes driving a wedge between us
i give up
and now she is abandoning you
lara grabs her raincoat and notices a stain on the back shoulder
irritated she heads back to the bathroom
lara rinses the stain under the sink surprised to see it run red
she looks at her hands blood
the doorbell rings
john rises to answer the door
lara looks at her coat wonders how the hell she got blood on her shoulder
she rubs liquid soap into it
as john opens the door detective quinn shows his badge
detective collero and a team of detectives push past
john has no time to react
luke sees the police rush past him and gets scared
my name is detective quinn
this is a search warrant for these premises
john hears luke cry and instinctively heads inside
stops him stay where you are
get your touch me again and youll be arrested
lara steps from the bathroom and is met by detective collero
she sees the coat with the water spot nods to a team member who takes it and bags it under lara brennan
lara brennan you are under arrest for the murder of elizabeth gesas
she takes her wrist and professionally turns and cuffs her
elizabeth is dead
tries to push past she didnt do anything
i will only tries again she didnt do anything
put him in cuffs
the uniform pushes him up against the wall and cuffs his wrists
john watches as his child cries his wife is led out in handcuffs and the house is torn apart
cut to black
a light comes on
john steps out of his bedroom and enters his sons room
just a bad dream
he comes back out carrying luke now six years old
john lays luke on the bed and climbs in beside him
okay you can sleep here as long as you stay on this side of the bed
luke immediately scrambles over his father to take his side
youre such a snake i dont know why i keep falling for the same trick
john kisses luke who closes his eyes and snuggles his pillow
john reaches for the lamp
beside it sits the framed photo that lara snapped of the three of them that fateful morning
he switches off the lamp and the screen goes black
the t the citys fast moving trolley rises up from underground and we crane up to see the city
but sams your friend right
tilt down from a passing t train to find john and luke walking toward the huge modern allegheny county jail
not at lunch
does he take your food
did he say something mean
luke nods about mommy
did you hit him
where did you hit him
near the swings
i bet that hurt
john waits in a long line mostly women
he glances over at the pleasant and colorful play area in the corner and sees children playing
luke plays by himself
john puts his key ring in a plastic container
the guard takes it and puts the keys with other visitors belongings
john guides his son toward the metal detector
luke walks through and the buzzer goes off
john instinctively moves forward to help
a guard stops him with a hand on his chest
on the other side of the metal detector another guard runs a wand over luke pulls something from his pocket looks at it curiously
its a toy
the guard runs the wand over the child again no screech
the guard waves john through
john kneels and pulls on lukes jacket
well get it back
they walk along the hall with all the other visitors
john stares out the window at the city beyond
life seems so close
he looks back into the large communal visiting room a dozen round tables and plastic chairs
the concrete block walls are covered with naive paintings in bright colors and messages of hope
luke plays at his feet with a basket of legos
the door at the far side buzzes a guard opens it and prisoners in red jump suits marked visiting room enter
lara enters and looks around
she is pale thin and her hair has returned to its natural color
lara hurries to him and gives him a real kiss
she breaks and steps to luke who plays with his back to her
can mommy get a kiss
tickles him come on give mommy a kiss
give mommy a kiss
he gives her a peck on the cheek and goes back to his legos
is daddy reading you my letters
every night at bedtime
what are you building
lara pulls him into a hug no response
she kisses his head and sits at the table with john
she squeezes his hand
was he scared going to school
i walked him to class gave him a kiss he didnt even look back to wave
what did you make him for lunch
turkey sandwich just butter and bread no vegetables on it
he swore he ate his apple
he hands her a pack of photos
lara devours them
look at his friends
and his desk
this is his teacher
you may have to move to another school district
already spoke to a realtor
still looking at photos how was your first day
over half my class stayed awake
talked to your mom
when is she coming
shes having a lot of trouble with her business
its only been a couple of years im sure shell get around to it
beat have you heard anything
about the appeal
yes and im just not telling you
what did meyer say
dont it can take months for the court to rule
i saw that woman
she was there
she couldnt have just disappeared
meyers looking for a new investigator
her coat snagged my purse i felt a button pop they must have been blind not to find it
hell go through all the evidence again
great because i havent quite bankrupted us yet
were doing fine
fondly you just lie and lie
strokes his face but you are very handsome
admiring him can you do me a favor
i dont know im a little busy
i need you to run for governor
oh that i can do
you can change this rule about no conjugal visits because i dont think i can last another twenty years
she smiles but is already traveling toward a dark place
he reaches out and holds her tight stroking her back
but its going to be fine
she just stares at luke his back to them playing
you think hell ever want to kiss me again
the prisoners file out and are patted down
lara turns and blows luke and john a kiss
they watch with the other visitors who all stand on the far side of the room
lara and the female inmates pull off their visiting jump suits and hand them to a female guard who searches them for contraband
lara retrieves her regular jump suit and pulls it on over her underwear
another small daily humiliation
start very close on johns digital watch
widen to see luke standing on a low step at the sink in his pajamas using a complicated looking electric toothbrush
john sits on the toilet staring at his watch
twenty eight twenty nine thirty
luke puts it down and checks his teeth in the mirror
the garage door opens the prius has a lot more miles on it
john backs out luke in his child seat
he brakes and finds paula the woman who lives behind them at his window
shes doing okay
tell her were pulling for her
she holds up a plastic water bottle
they wont recycle these unless you take off the cap
bottle this is trash
this is recyclable
john drives off wondering what kind of world he lives in
sitting on the park bench john allows his feelings to wash over his face
he watches luke play with a girl his age
lets go toad
luke runs to him
john pulls lukes jacket on
he doesnt notice the young mother on the next bench nicole watching him admiringly
she calls to the girl luke was playing with
time to go carrie
john glances in time to see carrie plop down in the sand arms folded
he shares a sympathetic smile with nicole who heads to retrieve her daughter
john walks off with luke
john waits as a courtroom lets out
meyer fisk steps out with a young associate
he spots john and approaches
john i said my office at four oclock
i cant leave im in holds up a subway bag i figured you had to eat
meyer relents turns and calls to his associate
do you have the ruling in brennan
she kneels and digs through her rolling briefcase
john sits on a bench pale and shaken flipping through the ruling
the courtroom is empty save a bailiff eating at his desk
during this he gets up and walks out past them
but what if we find the woman who was leaving the parking lot
the pcra was rejected
no new evidence can be submitted
it was a robbery
someone stole her purse
and if theyd used her credit cards we would have had something to argue
im sorry this really
john offers a smile at meyers unlawyer like choice of words
so thats it
now we just have the supreme court
john in the last thirty years the supreme court hasnt heard one murder case
no decent lawyer would even file the pleadings
so i need to find an indecent one
no im going to file it
but i need you to do something for me
i need you to look at the evidence and just forget lara is your wife
stopped by that ive seen the evidence meyer
im not saying judge her innocent or guilty im just saying look at it
he co worker sees her leaving the scene she has the victims blood on her clothes her fingerprints on the murder weapon is this a bad joke
we went out for dinner
how do you do that after you kill somebody
she would have to be a psychopath
and the fight in the office
everyone fights with their boss
but this one ended up dead
john looks at meyer anew feeling profoundly betrayed
so you never believed she was innocent
how can you say that
so what are you saying meyer
that it no longer matters what we believe laras not getting out
and you have no idea how much i hate saying that
exiting ill find someone to file the pleadings
for christs sake
john is long gone
meyer hurls his sandwich into the trash
john waits alone on the visitors side of the glass
the door opens and lara steps up on the other side
john smiles and picks up the phone but lara sees something in his face and doesnt pick up her phone just stares at him
john fights to keep his smile and nods for her to pick up her phone but now she can see the verdict chiseled on his face
lara gasps and cries inconsolably
john keeps the smile plastered on his face but now tears run down his cheeks
he taps on the glass and points at her phone but she doesnt respond
he taps harder and harder desperately wanting to comfort her but she wont allow it
he bangs on the glass with his fist drawing the attention of the guard on his side
lara turns and exits
john stands and yells her name but she cant hear it and neither can we
were in an old working class neighborhood
john sits in his car trying to pull himself together
mick opens the door
grace their mother looks up from clearing the lunch dishes
johns face tells them everything they need to know
mick slams his fist against the door
in the back yard with luke george johns father turns to see grace tearfully embrace john
george looks away uncomfortable and distracts lukes attention
john mick and grace sit in the worn wicker chairs on the back porch
erit steps out with beers to replace their empties
she sits and they stare off watching luke and george play with the dog
after a moment erit looks to john i know you wont want to hear this
erit go put somebody to sleep
she stares unbelieving then walks off in a huff
had to be done
long beat i am really going to pay for that
john has to smile
john drives through a rough part of town on their way home
he stops at a light and notes the dealers on the corner
a flashy car pulls up hands are slapped call the driver david
he takes a roll of cash from the dealer looks around catches john staring
john looks away quickly and drives off
john sits at his desk surrounded by boxes of documents and photographs
as john sifts through the evidence
lara and her boss elizabeth argue loudly
its raining outside
elizabeth stands at her car door in a small partially covered garage maybe a dozen spots
she turns toward camera a fire extinguisher comes right at camera making a terrible impact and elizabeth collapses to the floor
lara turns holding the fire extinguisher
as he flips through a handwritten witness statement
laras car speeds out of the parking lot
a male co worker steps out of the rain just as her car passes
he stops as he sees elizabeths body lying beside her car
lara tries to scrub the blood off of her coat
the phone beside him shrieks
john picks it up
its late prime time for the er
john runs in
john enters breathlessly and finds the nurses station
lara brennan my wife
she was sent up here
b r finds name in roster she cant have visitors
thats ridiculous i have to see her
john turns away and heads down the corridor to find her himself
the duty nurse sees this and takes off after him you cant go down there
john shoves open a door moves on to the next
you cant be in here
running up i got him
a long haired doctor becsey steps into his path
whats going on
my wife attempted suicide
hands doctor chart shes not allowed visitors
i have to see her
why isnt she in the er
im not asking
shes a transfer from county jail
becsey is not unmoved
he shares a look with the nurse
becsey opens the door for john
note a prison guard standing outside
a uniformed female prison guard looks up from her magazine and keeps her eyes on john
he looks to his wife whos attached to an i
and monitors pale and weak her arm bandaged where she cut it open along the artery
lara opens her heavy eyelids and john glimpses something terrible in her eyes shes tortured to be alive
he kneels beside her and puts a hand on the bed
she takes his little finger wraps her fingers around it
john opens the door to let jenna out she looks considerably older
he just keeps pretending hes asleep
reaching for his wallet dont worry about it
i kept you out on a school night
im not in school anymore
she offers a sad smile and leaves without the cash
luke lies in the crook of his fathers arm his own arms full of penguins turtles a black dog and an opossum
john reads him a letter the yellow envelope open on the bed
and give a big hug to pengui little pengui big turtley little turtley kiki and opossumy
lots and lots of love mommy
beat you gonna give them hugs from her
no response should we write her back
when is she coming home
thinks for a moment then can i have a quarter
can you have a quarter
luke points at the glass coin dish on night stand
sure but you cant spend those
they come from the cottage where mommy and i used to take you when you were a baby
then can i have them all
he hands luke the jar and hoists up him and his animals
luke sets the coin jar on his nightstand
john tucks him in with his animals then switches off the lamp
john looks back before closing it and watches luke lie awake staring at the jar lost in confused thoughts of his mother
dirty dishes piled in the sink john unloads the dishwasher
he finds the handle has cracked off lukes favorite mug
he places the cup and handle on the counter opens a drawer crammed with tools and screws and tape and such
he rummages through it
not finding what he is looking for he pulls handfuls of junk out of the drawer and slams it all down on the counter
the harder he searches the more he becomes frustrated until he slams the drawer and leans on the counter feeling destroyed and needy
and then a female hand appears beside him opens another drawer and reaches in
john stares at the hand afraid to move afraid to look up
the hand finds a tube of glue places it on the counter and moves away
john turns to see lara walking away
she turns smiling and shaking her head and disappears into the dining room
stunned john looks down at the glue on the counter then suddenly pushes away and rushes into the dining room
no sign of her
and she isnt in the living room
he bolts into the foyer and finds the front door slightly ajar
he flings it open
john rushes out into the street looking up and down for her finally realizing she was never there
he stands in the middle of the street now searching for some way to survive
don quixote is written on the chalkboard
so what is it about
that belief in someones virtue is more important than virtue itself
i mean yes thats in there
but what is it about
it is about how rational thought destroys the soul
it is about the triumph of irrationality and the power that is in it
john drops an armload of books into a library cart each having something to do with prison or prison life
he sits at a table at the back flipping through them one at a time and discards each in turn
as the shadows grow longer we find him staring at the computer screen linked to the school system
on the screen a book summary disappears to be replaced by the school search engine many of the items have already been inspected
john finds one that reads over the walls
he clicks on the link and the title page appears
the author is damon pennington
theres a photo of him
the caption reads that he lives in brooklyn ny
john gets out of a cab and heads into a local dive bar
a couple of guys at the bar yell at the dog race on the tv screen
damon hands john a beer and nods toward a table
its a course that investigates what drives men to be free no matter the cost
somebody else had dibs on papillon
you escaped from jail seven times
damon lights a cigarette
a tough guy nearby objects
yeah who would want to cut short your precious life
damon takes a deep drag
mind if i tape you
go for it it cant be used as evidence
what do you want to know
john sets up the small digital recorder
how you escaped when no one else could
balls and a little luck
beat no prison in the world is airtight
each one has a key
you have to find it
how do you do that
a lot of looking
especially at things that break the daily routine
guards get comfortable doing the same thing every day
something happens where they have to think adapt
thats when they will make mistakes
but when you see it you have to be ready
you have to have the entire plan already in place before you even know how you are going to get out of the jail
escaping is easy the hardest part is staying free
the tape recorder plays damons voice john tears large sheets of art paper from a pad and tacks them to his bedroom wall
you have to know where you are going to go and how you are going to get there
you have to know how they plan to catch you where and when
how the hell do you know that
he starts to write on the paper with a large felt marker
you pay off someone who knows
and a lot depends on if the prison is in the country or the city
that came out too quickly
damon now understands
john sits silent knowing he blew it
damon takes his time
where are you from
pittsburgh is tough so many bridges and tunnels they can block off
the art paper bunches and rips under the pressure of the marker
john tears it off the wall
from the time they make the call the police can have the center of the city sealed tight in fifteen minutes
how can they be so exact
after homeland security made every city have a lock down plan downtown pittsburgh philly boston minneapolis fifteen minutes
they can do dc in under ten
john draws a circle on the wall and writes in it minutes within thirty five minutes they will have cops at every tollbooth on the interstate surrounds it by a
larger circle minutes
and be running rolling stops on the secondary roads
they wont have your photograph yet but they will have your description
he draws spokes out from the circles
what if you cant make it out
thirty five minutes isnt a lot of time
because they will shoot you on sight along with anyone you are with
john writes description at the end of one spoke
stay far away from the train and bus stations
forget the local airports
leave from another state
john scribbles key words on the wall
its easy to find fake papers harder to find ones that will get you through an airport
john writes identities
youll need a passport drivers license and a social security number
if you have to rent a car find a place that will take a cash deposit
theyll still run a credit check so use a real persons name on the id
beat third destination
john writes furiously on the wall
you want somewhere that doesnt attract american tourists and doesnt get american newspapers
think yemen and you get the idea
johns writes money
you need a truck load of it
everythings expensive hotels travel information
enough to last at least five six years
run out of money and you run out of friends
john underlines money
john is starting to understand the enormity of this undertaking
but before you do anything you have to ask yourself if you can do it
can you forget about ever seeing your parents again
can you kill a guard leave your kid at a gas station push a nice old lady to the ground because she is between you and the door
because to do this thing thats who you have to become
and if you cant dont start because youll just get someone killed
john backs away from the wall to see it covered in a spiderweb of notes
how did you get caught
i gave myself up
i couldnt take wondering when someone was going to come through the bedroom door
beat got what you need
what do you have in your pocket
john opens his billfold
damon takes the cash leaves him a twenty
on the wall we see the massive diagram john has created
the screen goes black
read the train crosses a bridge
john rides looking down at the river below
john steps through the puffer the machine that detects drugs and into the secure area
he makes a mental note of everything he sees the number of guards cameras etc
john sits in his car on the road above surreptitiously taking pictures of the vehicles coming and going from the prison
he tapes the photos to the wall
walking down a corridor with the other visitors john steps in a puddle of water
behind him the others notice and step around it
moving on they pass a trustee on a ladder pulling a water stained ceiling tile away as two guards watch
john traces a route on a map with a highlighter
the wall grows thick with photos and notes
he reads an article on his computer about illegal aliens and fake ids
john enters his bedroom and closes the door
we see how dramatically his plan has evolved on the wall as every inch is covered in notes photos maps and various writings
he studies it as he bites into a sandwich
john and luke walk near the front of the group of visitors toward the visitation rooms
just ahead he notices a guard using a key to call the elevator
john stops near the elevator and kneels pulling one of lukes shoelaces loose
it was already tied
john reties the lace as the group moves on
he keeps one eye on the elevator
the door opens and the guard steps in and john notices two workmen in hardhats inside
the elevator closes the shoelace is tied the group has moved on down the hall and they are alone
john pulls the laces and unties lukes shoe
you untied it again
the guard looks back now impatient
john offers a smile and throws a look down at the elevator tread sees the name otis elevator company
suddenly a voice comes from behind mr
startled john turns to see dr
we met briefly
to approaching guard ill bring them back myself
john leaves luke playing and steps into the office
lifson partially closes the door so john can still see his son
we check your wifes blood regularly
shes been refusing her insulin
i dont want to sound dramatic but its just another form of suicide
ill talk to her
if she doesnt ill talk to her
steps out lets go squirrel
john and luke wait
the prisoners enter
lara looks terrible
john stands and embraces her
are you alright
lara smiles to cover and bends down and kisses her son who is engrossed in his toys as usual
hi sweet potato
how are you doing
he doesnt respond
she kisses him on the head then takes a seat
john sits beside her
they speak in whispers
the doctor told me about the insulin
watching luke yeah i forgot
its no big deal
for how many days
i forgot okay
i have things on my mind
and so much to do
oh thats nice
why are you doing this
can i please just watch him play
tell me about kindergarten
i need you to fine i wont forget again okay
trying to fight away these thoughts i am just never going to walk him to school or wash his clothes or make him dinner
and i dont know how i can live knowing that
look at me
something will happen
cruelly but hushed what
what is going to happen
there are no more appeals there are no more anything
exactly what miracle are we hoping for john
he looks down beaten
she lets go of her anger
i need you to do something for me
stop bringing him
he hates coming here
look at him
its not his fault
its too hard to watch him forget me
john looks at his son playing at a distance his back to them
its hard to argue with her shes right
you want to hear something funny
my mother tried to send me anti aging cream
john smiles but like hers it may be the saddest smile in the world
they sit and watch luke play
john checks his bank statements and adds them up on the wall under money
the total is
he stares at that figure for a moment
eugenie the real estate agent walks john to the door
youre sure that you dont want a lawn sign
im very sure
a student shows john how to use photoshop to enlarge and crop a photo
john uses photoshop looking through family pictures for an appropriate one to use for laras id
some of them are of the family at a cottage
he finds one that will work and starts to crop himself and luke as a baby out of the photo
then he turns and notices luke standing behind him staring at the screen
a helicopter swoops over a bridge and traces the monongahela river through the city
on the door of the helicopter is emblazoned the name of a local tour company
john sits among six other passengers
on the left allegheny county jail
built in it is now the largest jail in the world
there have been three escape attempts
no ones made it out alive
on your right
everyone else looks to the right as the pilot continues
john stays fixed on the left window
the massive rooftops of the jail
but then he sees exactly what he is looking for workmen wearing yellow helmets spread hot tar and roofing paper
he spots a workman carrying a bucket heading around a tall outcropping on the roof
lyla a student reads from the idiot as john returns to his desk with papers in his hands
his laptop lies open to google earth the rooftop view of the jail from another angle
john closes it and spreads the papers on his desk a printed color version of the same
he draws an arrow to the outcropping where we now see a door labels it elevator
on the first landing which was as small as the necessary turn of the stairs allowed there was a niche in the column about a yard wide and in this
niche the prince felt convinced that a man stood concealed
he thought he could distinguish a figure standing there
john searches craigslist for helicopter pilots
clicks on one that reads experienced helicopter pilot combat vet where a magazine clipping of a helicopter sits under the heading escape
overlapping it he pins trimmed print outs of several pilot candidates
directly underneath is the google earth photo of the rooftop of the jail the door marked with an arrow and the landing site indicated with an x in a circle
below that is a rough sketch of the visitors room and the adjacent corridor with an arrow marking the elevator
in block letters beside it is the word key
luke john and george stand in the foyer luke with his child sized brightly colored overnight bag
john pulls off lukes coat kisses him on the head and looks up at george
george nods takes lukes hand and walks to the kitchen
john drives taking note of the corners where young men hang out selling drugs or contraband
john walks up to a guy leaning on the bumper of his car the trunk partially open
call him mouss
ten apiece five for forty
john hands him a twenty mouss digs into a bag in his trunk and hands him a blister pack strip of two pills samples
i need some passports
john nods and walks back across the street
the guy watches
john climbs into his car and tosses the pills onto the passenger seat among a half dozen others
there is a sharp rap on his window mouss
john rolls down the window
you have to pay up front
i can do that
you know the uptown on th ave

whats your name

john parks and steps out of his car
hip hop blares the clientele are low lives john doesnt exactly fit in as he enters and orders
his words are drowned out
the bartender gives him a beer on tap
john asks for hart
the bartender nods to a man at the back who is playing a video game
john walks off passing a long haired guy at the bar who watches him
john approaches harv
mouss said to come see you
he did did he
what do you want
three passports a drivers license and real social security number
how do you know mouss
he babysits my kid
sizes him up then okay
harv gives him a look nods for him to follow
they step out the back door
you have the photos on you
mouss steps out of the shadows and cracks john across the back of the head with a pipe
john stumbles to the ground
the two men kick the shit out of john
john tries to protect his face they just keep kicking
mouss finally grabs johns hair and flicks a knife in his face as harv searches his pockets and finds his money
i ever see you again you lose an eye
the two men walk away and get into mouss van
john lies doubled up on the ground and eventually tries to stand
john cleans the cuts on his face with peroxide adds a band aid
he stares at his face letting defeat wash over him
john deducts from the money column
his face purple with bruises john pulls himself out of bed in response to the ringing doorbell
john limps to the front door and opens it to see eugenie his realtor standing with a nice couple
they see his face try and hide their reactions
you did remember i was showing the house
give me two minutes
john tacks two large dark blue sheets up over the wall covering his plan
eugenie reassures her skittish clients
it really is a great neighborhood
grace johns mother opens the door and sees johns face
oh my lord
john sits as grace approaches with iodine and cotton balls
through the window he sees luke playing with the dog
it was stupid i fell off the bike
the bike thats been in our garage for two years
put your head back
some guy made a crack about lara
so thats what you do now punch everyone who thinks shes guilty
whats that supposed to mean
it means its important what you believe not really
so what do you believe mom
john stands and opens the back door
why are you trying to start a fight
calling out back door come on buddy
to his mother where is his bag
why are you doing this
luke enters as grace tries to hide her tears
i just stupidly thought people who loved her would actually believe shes innocent
john turns and sees george standing in the open doorway
he has heard everything
he gives his son a dismissive look and walks off towards his bedroom
john feels like a heel
to luke give grandma a kiss
luke does and the two of them leave with his bag
john gets in and checks his mirror
luke is staring at him
does your face hurt
did you hit him back
john pulls away
john drives looking for someone selling fake papers
he sees mouss parked car and slows mouss stares at him
john flashes his middle finger and drives on
mouss considers doing something but just flips him off
john asks a couple of guys on the corner about papers and is turned away
as he returns to his car he doesnt notice mike the long haired guy from drakes bar watching from astride his motorcycle
a second rider pulls up beside mike
john pulls out and the motorcycles follow at a distance
john watches jenna leave closes the door climbs the stairs
john sees luke sleeping surrounded by his animals
the doorbell rings
john peers out surreptitiously sees mike standing there
he rings the bell again
john runs and snatches a kitchen knife returns to the door secures the chain lock and opens the door a crack
mike speaks in a loud atonal and unnerving voice
i was at the bar
i know what you are looking for
caught off guard by the voice john just stares at him
im deaf you idiot
i read lips
john stares at him unsure what to do
you really want to talk out here
john puts the knife in his back pocket and steps out onto
john tries to look tough
mike smiles at johns bravado
what do you need
john indicates mike should lower his voice
three passports a drivers license and social security number that can take a credit check
thirty seven hundred
thats too much
it is if you never get them
i need photos and a thousand in advance
john stares at the man trying to read him
john pulls cash and an envelope from his jacket pocket
mike counts the money and shoves it in his breast pocket
ill bring them wednesday
dont come here again
mike stares at him
john stares back
parking lot of dons
under the bridge two oclock
if im not there on time leave
john closes the door behind him and watches mike walk off toward his motorcycle
he drops the carving knife back in the drawer
as he looks up he sees the second rider staring in the window his helmet still on
johns heart almost stops
the rider drives off
a beat up old van sits parked on the crumbling sidewalk
john hands seven hundred dollars to a sketchy looking guy inside
the guy hands john a mm handgun wrapped in a oilcloth
john unwraps it and hands it back
show me how to load it
john and luke enter the back door
luke automatically heads for the living room
john calls after him no video game
john moves to check the answering machine
ill play checkers with you after dinner
youll just lose again
on voicemail john
youre not going to believe it the people i brought over
they made an offer
ill bring it in the morning
buoyed to luke not tonight
tonight i utterly destroy you
john watches a video on youtube how to unlock any door
the person on screen demonstrates how to make a bump key
a bump key
first find any key that fits into the same make of lock
john files down a key held in the jaws of a vice
john inserts the bump key into the door lock bumps it with the butt of a screwdriver
the key wont turn
he files down the key some more
he inserts the key bumps it turns
the lock opens
john gets in heading up to his classroom
people avoid looking at his face
one woman cant help noticing
john nods and smiles
he pushes the elevator button and notices the name otis elevator company
john scans the room as he waits
two children play in the set that is used to teach them how to speak to a prisoner behind glass using a phone
a moment later a woman enters with a large shoulder bag
she is a notary
no other visitors today
a notary sits with lara and john
and just put your thumb there
and lara puts her thumb print on the book
thanks thats all i need
the notary heads for the door
john turns to the female guard who is waiting
ill just be a moment
he turns back to his wife
touching him melting your poor face
how could you do that to yourself
i am useless without you
i cant even ride a bike
i think its very sexy
im sorry we had to do this
you have nothing to apologize for
but you should have told me before this
i dont want you not telling me things
from now on i will
beat i wont know where to picture you
off his look i close my eyes and i see luke in his bedroom you on the sofa by the window
i wont know where to picture you anymore
john stares at his laptop as the class does a test
knowing he isnt paying attention a student angles his multiple choice test so that his friend behind can see the answers
john waits for the janitor to leave his tiny office and grabs the door before it closes
he slips inside and finds a rack with keys
he takes one from the hook marked elevators
john files down the elevator key as he did the house key
john moves aside a box on the shelf and removes the handgun wrapped in an old chamois
he turns to see paula standing in the open garage door
john tries to look casual as he stands with the thinly disguised gun in his hand
i was wondering if i could ask you to water my plants next week im going in for an operation
i hope its nothing serious
my idiot doctor misdiagnosed me
hes blaming the lab the labs blaming him
but ill be fine
and she walks off
john gets in the car and slips the gun between the seats
john pulls into the empty parking lot beside dons and waits
checks his watch pm
a car pulls in
the guy sits there for a second then gets out and enters the restaurant
john checks his watch
he looks around knowing he is supposed to leave
he makes a call
english department this is catherine
luke isnt feeling well im going to take him home
i need carl to cover my class
i will let him know
john checks his watch
his cell phone rings displays the name mick john presses ignore
he feels for the gun between the seats
the guy comes out of the restaurant
john watches him walk to his car
the man sees him and stares back
john checks his watch
the guy drives off leaving the lot empty
john presses the voicemail button on his phone
are you ever going to answer your goddamn phone
suddenly a man in a helmet raps on his side window and john realizes mike has pulled up without him noticing
his hand goes to the split between the seats but stops short as the second rider pulls up to the passenger window
you were supposed to leave
i need them
you notice that guy was a cop
the one with the red light in his back window
john feels ridiculous
mike hands him the documents
just give me the money
john hands him the envelope of money
mike checks it
you want this too much
youre going to fuck it up
mike speeds off
the second rider gives john a look and follows
john looks over the passports with their new names
luke gets out of the car and heads into the house swinging his lunch pale
john watches him go then reaches down beside his seat and pulls out the gun wrapped in a cloth
he hides it in the garage and thinks about what he is doing
john moves through the line toward the metal detector
he takes his key ring out of his pocket and slips it and the separate elevator bump key into a white plastic dish and
places it atop the x ray machine
he steps through the metal detector and then grabs the plastic dish before the guard can get to it
he hands the dish to the guard
how are you doing today
dont touch that
john puts the dish down and we see the bump key is gone john palmed it
the guard dumps johns key ring on the counter with the keys and cell phones from the other visitors
john pockets the palmed key as he enters the jail
john moves down the hall with the fifty or so other visitors
he eases toward the elevator keeping his eye on the guard ahead
by the time the group stops for the door ahead to open johns managed to be right beside the elevator
he folds his coat over his arm to block others from seeing and feels for the slot
finding it he slips in the bump key
the guard at the lead opens the door to the first visiting room and the crowd starts moving again
john quickly bumps the key and turns it but it wont turn
he bumps it again
visitors keep moving past him
he looks over his shoulder sees the guard following them is preoccupied at the door
he turns it harder
he tries to pull it out
the rear guard closes the entry door and follows the crowd
john tugs at it one last time and then turns it hard and snaps it off in the lock
a black woman among the visitors sees what he is doing but averts her eyes
john drops the rest of the broken key and kicks it into the slot between the elevator and the shaft
he slips back into the crowd and moves on
near the rear of the crowd now john approaches the door to the visiting room
he throws a look back sees another guard step up and try to insert his key in the elevator
john rounds the corner into the visiting room
the camera stays on his face until we finally hear a deafening alarm
john waits in a line against the wall beside a door to a small office
through the glass he watches the major interview the black woman who noticed what he was doing
she nods and leaves passing him with a look
the major holds the door open for him
the major plays john the cctv video from the corridor
he flips between two camera positions at either end of the hall
the crowd of visitors shuffling toward the visiting rooms obscures the view of the elevator
so you are where in here
in the middle there
in the middle
can you point to yourself
looks its hard to tell
i think thats me there
he freezes the tape and points to a blurry figure in the background
so thats not you there
by the elevator
points to another person i was over here
you want to tell me whats going on
you want me to tell you
the major holds the piece of the key that jammed in the lock
you know what a bump key is
major puts it on the desk and just stares at john
finally if this was you you might want to think about whats going to happen to your kids if both of their parents are in prison
the major stares right through him
john heads toward the exit accompanied by a guard
as he nears the elevator he sees a technician climbing a step ladder holding a new cctv camera
face chalk white john heads for the exit fighting the urge to run
the door opens just before he gets there and collero steps in quinn holding the door for her
john charges past noticing neither of them but quinn recognizes him
quinn turns and watches as john doubles over the short wall nearby and vomits
the worst date youve ever been on
this was worse
and this guy
he really thinks he is doing great
then hes driving me home and i know hes going to try and kiss me so i pretend to fall asleep
i mean im actually snoring right in his car
does that stop him
john turns and notices quinn behind the door watching him
they lock eyes
collero realizes that quinn isnt paying attention and wonders what hes looking at
john turns and walks away
quinn keeps watching
did i tell you not to date cops
colleros eyes find john as well
he disappears around the corner
john rides home devastated that his plan has failed and wondering what he will do
he checks over his shoulder to make sure he isnt being followed
john sits on the bare wood floor of the living room
his head turns as he hears someone pounding on the front door
he throws a look to the garage thinks about the gun dismisses the idea
then he hears the voice his brother
let me in asshole
mick bangs again
more banging your car is in the garage i know youre in there
john doesnt move
as we pull back we see that the living room and dining room have been stripped of every bit of furniture save an old tv set sitting on a box
john knows he cant let his brother see this
the male neighbor in the house to the south opens his door and looks out and scowls
whats your problem
hes not home
so youre saying im blind
no im saying youre an idiot
mick pounds on the door aggressively
then just gives up
you know what
i am an idiot
and he walks off to his car
john leans back against the wall in the middle of the bare room and listens to his brothers car start and drive away
john stands staring at his wall now a vast collage layer upon layer of photographs and notes
and no answers
john sits on a bench frustrated and lost
luke trots up
can i have my cookies
you want your sandwich
john hands him two packaged cookies
luke runs off and hands them to carrie
her attractive young mother nicole sitting a couple of benches down calls and draws johns attention
to john im sorry
she just already has it all figured out
john nods awkwardly nicole
knows he doesnt really
smiles and admits i remember your daughter
shes hard to forget
digs in her bag oh this is for you
luke was supposed to bring it home
hands him an envelope
he opens it and sees a birthday invitation with jungle animals on the cover
he has his fathers memory
its for carries birthday party
please come id love to meet your wife
im afraid she cant be there
with me too
carrie come on time for lunch
to john were going to the cafe on the corner would you like to join us
oh were pretty
john smiles busted
come on we owe you for the cookies
and i made those cookies
and learned how to pre package them
which requires a considerable amount of machinery
come on luke
they walk toward the street the kids trailing behind
neither john nor nicole speak for a moment
do you trade off time with luke
luke and i are together full time
i guess thats why i see you so much
shed like nothing better than to be here
she really misses
i guess its all about priorities isnt it
shes not like that
has to admit shes in prison
i dont tell most people
she didnt kill the woman
i mean im sure she didnt
nicole doesnt know what else to say
we should really be getting home
feigns disappointment oh okay
waving the envelope thanks for the invitation
well try and make it
that would be great
john heads back and scoops up luke
nicole watches trying not to look dumbfounded
john and luke enter john sorting through the mail
nothing from lara
john finishes writing a letter on lined paper
he opens his drawer it is full of letters in yellow envelopes
he pulls one out it is from lara on lined paper
he stuffs his new letter in the old yellow envelope
this is the only room that is still furnished
john pokes his head in sees luke on his bed playing by himself
you want to read a letter from mom
luke shrugs as if he doesnt care but then scoots over in his bed so that his dad can sit beside him
he pulls the letter out of the envelope and reads
dearest luke who i love but not as much as chocolate
she didnt write that
dearest luke who i love so so much
i wish i could have walked you home today it was so beautiful out
luke and john water paulas vegetable garden
but whats wrong with her
shes not feeling well
why didnt she just stay home
because sometimes people get so sick you have to go to the hospital to get fixed
how do you know when youre that sick
the doctors do tests
john turns and looks back across the alley at his open garage
and remembers their conversation
he drops the hose and takes lukes hand
they drop the hose in the garden and walk back to the house
john flings open the medicine cabinet finds an old bottle of laras insulin
he checks the label
john hits a key and a medical article appears life severe hyperkalemia
extremely high levels of potassium cardiac arrest
particularly dangerous as there are no outward symptoms
the camera swirls as john searches the wall and photos of delivery vans arriving at the jail
not seeing what he wants he charges the desk rifles through more photos
he finally snatches the photo hes looking for
he turns it over on it is written tuesday am
and right over the phrase find the key he pins the photo of a delivery van from a medical laboratory
parked at a distance john watches from inside his prius
finally a driver steps out of the jail carrying a tray of test results
he opens the back door of the van
john follows the van
john watches as the driver steps out with a tray point and push his key fob lock the doors and enter the nursing home
in the prius moments later john watches his stopwatch
the driver returns with a tray
john hits the stop button
john googles how to break into a car
john heats a screwdriver on the open flame of the gas fire then places the red hot tip of it on an old tennis ball
john waits eating a donut
he sees the driver step out of pittsburgh med health lab and walk to his panel van
john follows the van again
wearing his ipod the driver steps out with a tray and presses his key fob the van chirps and locks
he enters the building as john steps up to the drivers door
john checks no one is watching places the tennis ball over the key slot and punches the ball flat
the lock pops open
shelves line the walls on them sit plastic trays of envelopes
john climbs in and finds the tray from allegheny county jail
the driver comes back out heading for the van
he pauses to flirt with a nurse on her break but she isnt buying
john finds the envelope marked lara brennan
he checks his watch only seconds have lapsed
he slips the card out photographs it with his cell phone and puts it back
the driver heads for the van as john opens the back door and climbs out
oblivious to his narrow escape john closes the door and walks away a heartbeat before the driver gets there
john checks his son who sits on the bare living room floor playing a video game on the tv the remaining item
luke nods and shoots somebody
john brings up laras form in photoshop on his laptop and erases the hand written numbers in the test results boxes
john writes numbers in the blank boxes of the medical form
then he sits back and worries that hes got it right
time for bed
john enters the childs bedroom and stops dead
the wall over lukes bed is covered with crayon scribbles imitating the chart on his fathers bedroom walls
luke walks into the room and steps up beside his father staring at the wall
he takes his fathers hand and the two just stand there in silence
john waits as the other prisoners enter
lara kisses him looks in his eyes
he sees the despair behind the smile
she takes a letter from her pocket
what is it
she hands it to him
his face changes
they cant move you
not without notice
monday isnt notice
i was only here through the appeal
we knew id be moved to a prison
muncy is the other side of the state
off johns face the screen goes black
read john stands with eugenie the frightened realtor
i dont have two weeks
i need it tomorrow
the title hasnt been cleared there is no way that how much can they give me
john turns on his heel and slams out through the door
john stares at the wall money is down to
he rifles through a drawer finds a pair of sunglasses
he snatches a baseball cap from a top shelf
he tosses a bag on the bed unzips it and pulls out the gun
john unscrews the license plate from a dusty black prius
he sticks the plate under his jacket stands and checks over his shoulder as he walks out of the massive parking lot
a quiet neighborhood bank sits in the corner of an outdoor mall
the prius pulls into a spot we dolly over to see the stolen license plate
inside the prius john opens the backpack puts on the hat and sunglasses and places the gun on his lap
and again he looks at the bank tapping his toe manically
a guard opens the bank door for a departing customer smiles and heads back inside
john tightens his grip on the gun tries to work up his courage but ultimately realizes he cant do this
furious with himself he jams the car into reverse and backs up without looking
he hears a scream brakes hard and looks
a woman screams
john stomps on the brakes
he leaps out of the car and sees a woman dropping her groceries and scooping her child up in her arms
call her elaine
what are you doing
you almost killed us
are you out of your mind
you dont look
she stoops to grab the few items that fell
he tries to help
i am so sorry
get away from us
she stands and runs for her car
john returns to the car and sits leaving the door open and the door alarm screaming
he sits there letting the failure and his disgust for his weakness wash over him
john sits in the childrens area waiting for the line of visitors to get shorter
one look at his face and we can see how tortured he is
he has his cell phone to his ear im sorry
no it was a long shot
into phone hows lara
john hangs up and stands
john stands in the corner staring out through the high thick windows
he turns as he hears lara and other prisoners coming
he tries to smile but she knows something is wrong
is it luke
i had meyer see what he could do about not getting you moved
i told him traveling that distance would be a hardship on us that luke was already having trouble at school
which is true
i havent been spending enough time with him
god john you are too much
luke is having a hard time because mommy is in jail for murder not because daddy doesnt spend enough time with him
your father was right you dont live in the same world we do
stung thats nice that the two of you talk
what world do i live in lara
i dont know but its not the real one
i am in here for the rest of my life
and you want me to believe in some fantasy that
a guard steps up and raps her knuckles on the table to get their attention
only john looks up
we good here
lara lowers her voice a little but not her intensity
the guard walks away under now you come here all long faced like youve let me down
what do you want me to do make you feel better
and now youre apologizing
you really are a gem
what do you want from me
youre too perfect already
you know you never even asked me if i did it
if i killed her
stopped dead because i knew you didnt
then youd be wrong
she leans forward and whispers in his ear
i grabbed the fire extinguisher
i hit her in the face
i heard her neck snap
you know why i did it
because she pissed me off
i threw her purse in the river
we paid for dinner with the cash from her wallet
she sits back a bit to look in his face
only now looking in his eyes a crack forms in her tough exterior
im actually very sorry
the guard opens the door and lets her into the changing room
john watches unable to breathe
lara gets one last look at john through the glass and then disappears behind the partition
she sits on the bench leans her head between her knees and breaks into shards
john exits along with all the other visitors destroyed by what he has heard playing out what she said in his head
then suddenly he just stops
the crowd keeps moving leaving him behind
the guard following the group sees him standing there
commands him sir you cannot stand there
beat sir you need to exit the building
lara takes a seat on her side of the glass partition
she picks up her phone and opens her mouth to speak
i dont care what you say or how you say it
i dont believe you did it and i never will
i know who you are
she opens her mouth to object but john slams the phone into the cradle
she pounds on the window
he just stares at her
her eyes well up and she smiles through her tears
john steps out and sees the major waiting with his keys
they exchange a look
the major nods and locks the door
john heads out
luke in his arms john takes a my little pony off the shelf
already an expert girls love them
grace opens the door
george stands a few steps behind her quiet
grace sees john and is immediately concerned
what are you doing here
ive got class
five oclock at night
kisses luke bye
luke runs in as john walks off
johns father watches through the window as his son leaves
in his gut george knows something is wrong
john sits in his car down the street watching the corner where he noticed kids selling drugs
a car shows up the same flashy car he saw weeks ago
the street dealer looks around runs to the window makes an exchange and then the car drives off again
john checks his watch and settles in to wait
john watches as other cars drive up and score drugs
and then finally the flashy car cruises up again
john checks his watch it has been two hours
again the street dealer runs up and hands the driver an envelope
we recognize the driver he is the one from earlier whom we are going to call david
he drives away
john follows the flashy car at a distance
it stops at another corner and something is exchanged
it drives on john follows
not the best part of town
it looks rough even for the hill
the flashy car parks and david crosses the street
half a block back john turns left at the corner and then makes a quick right into the alley
he guesses how many houses from the corner david stopped gets out and checks over the fences
he stops a few houses away when he sees the porch light on a house flick on
david waits on the dilapidated back porch
he waves to whoever is watching him through the pinhole and the light goes out again
john inches closer as the back door opens
david exchanges a few words with whoever opened it and then packages are exchanged
the door closes and david walks off the way he came
john waits a moment then moves down the alley hops the fence and sneaks through the twisted bramble of the back yard
he finds a place to hide on the ground right beside the back porch
he pulls out his gun and settles in to wait between the trash cans his heart pounding in his ears
fade to black
beat then bang
john wakes to hammering on the door
the porch light flicks on and john is bathed in bright light he didnt realize hed fallen asleep
david stands above him on the porch holding the screen door open if he glanced down there is no way he wouldnt see him
john holds his breath and waits
the porch light flicks off the locks are unbolted and finally the thick door opens
as before the two exchange words but now the pounding in johns ears is so loud we can barely hear anything else
john takes a deep breath and springs to his feet knocking over the trash cans and onto the porch
he smacks david with the gun grabs him by the hair and jams him forward into the doorway preventing the supplier alex from slamming the door on them
alex releases his barking german shepherd and it immediately attacks david biting his leg
david screams in agony
to alex back up
suddenly a thug comes barreling in from the kitchen and aims a sawed off shotgun at john who keeps himself right behind davids head
the dialogue is almost drowned out completely by the sound of pounding in johns ears and davids screaming
shoot them both
ill shoot the dog
shoot the dog
you shoot the dog ill kill you
john fires into the floor beside the dog
you want the police here asshole
john fires two more shots into the floor
to thug put the gun down
the thug obeys rests it against the wall
call the dog off
put it away
the dog stops its attack but goes back to barking
put it away
aims gun at it alex reluctantly opens a closet door
he has to shove the barking dog into the closet
to thug you too
im not getting in there
john fires into the wall
and the thug goes in the closet after the barking dog
john sees the bolt and drives it home locking the door
give me that chair
alex doesnt obey so david grabs it and hands it to him
john props it under the handle of the closet door
he shoves david forward closer to alex
i didnt do anything
you brought him
i didnt bring him
he pushes them both back into the next room the dog in the closet never stops barking
john shoves david to the floor and waves the gun between them
on your knees
hands behind your head
john catches alexs eyes darting to the counter
following his gaze he finds alexs revolver on the counter
john grabs it flips open the cylinder and spills out the cartridges
i cant kneel
on the floor
david kneels with great difficulty
alex calmly does as hes told his eyes on john
john grabs the paper bag out of alexs hand and opens it finds a couple thousand in cash
wheres the rest
thats twelve hundred dollars
emptying his pockets here take it
a couple of hundred dollars spill onto the floor
gun on alex where do you keep your money
alex scoffs seeing weakness in john
yeah im going to give you my money
ill shoot you
you wont even shoot a dog
shoot the floor again impress me
john pistol whips him and alex goes down
john holds his gun to his head while he is on the ground bleeding
im going to kill you both
no im going to kill you both
give him your money
to david keep your dead bitch mouth shut
enraged john fires a round into alexs leg
smiles thru pain see
you arent going to kill me
that was the worst you can do
so now youve done it
ill come find you and kill you
john looks around desperately
he spots an open bottle of tequila in the clutter on the counter
he grabs it and pours it on the floor
youre wasting some good shit
now he pours it on alex
yeah good shit high alcohol content
john smashes the bottle on the floor tequila goes everywhere
whats going on
let me out
you going to burn me out
john lights a rag as the thug in the closet continues to yell and pound
now calmly yeah
thats what im going to do
no longer smiling this is a meth lab you idiot
and he tosses the burning rag at the smashed bottle
david screams as the room explodes in flames
suddenly desperate my kid is upstairs
without warning alex dashes for the front hall
stunned john doesnt shoot
he grabs david by the hair sticks the gun in his temple and shoves him into the front hall
let me go
get up there
john pushes him up the stairs as a shield following the trail of blood
the house is going to explode
fire spreads the thug yells the dog barks
the shotgun leans against the wall where the thug left it
the closet door rocks as the thug kicks
the chair wont give way
john moves david quickly up the stairs in front of him and down the hall
they peer into one room nothing
into the next what is clearly a childs room
alex kneels on the far side of the room barely visible behind the small bed his back to us
until he wheels gun in hand and fires twice
a bullet strikes david in the chest the second grazes johns side
both men are knocked back into the hall and onto the floor
john pulls himself out from under david as
running on adrenaline alex stands and strides forward
david looks up at him
alex shoots him again and steps over him into the hall
he sees john raises his weapon and
john fires twice hits alex in the chest knocking him down
alex lies dead sprawled over david
david looks around through the roiling smoke is anyone up here
he steps over alex and into the room
he checks the closet empty of clothes clearly no child lives here
john turns to where alex was kneeling sees a bureau pushed aside a safe crudely installed in the wall lying open a trash bag on the floor half filled with
john drops to his knees and shovels the remaining cash into the trash bag
the dog barks the door splinters
john steps over the bodies sees david looking up at him
dont leave me
i dont want to burn
dont let me burn
the hall is now thick with smoke
john stares terrified at the two men one dead one dying and agonizes over what he knows is a mistake
cut to black
john carries david past the closet just as the thugs boot kicks a hole in the door
cut to black
john bleeding himself shoves the badly wounded dealer into the back seat
he throws the trash bag into the passenger seat and slams the door closed behind him
not even a heartbeat later the german shepherd leaps up and snaps at the partially open window
john struggles to get the car turned on and the window up as the dog tries to force his way into the car
through the front windshield he sees the thug leap over the back fence landing sprawled in the alley with the shotgun
john jams the car into reverse and backs away the man in the back seat screaming for his life the dog chasing the car the thug getting off a shot
john swerves wide around the corner hitting a fire hydrant and shattering a taillight
john slams the transmission into drive and speeds off down the street
the dog barking disappears
all thats left are the sounds of the dying man
john keeps throwing looks over his shoulder
i dont want to die
i dont want to die
now at a safe distance john pulls over and looks into the back seat
we dont have to see the body to know hes dead
john sits there a moment listening to the sounds of approaching fire engines
he catches a glimpse of himself in the rearview mirror before pulling out
cut to black
johns car idles at the curb his back door sits open
he steps back into shot from the far side of the prius closes the door and gets in
as he drives away we see davids body lying on the bench waiting to be discovered
standing at the sink shirtless john pours alcohol on the wound in his side
he mops up the blood with a wad of paper towels then applies a bandage fresh from the box
he pulls a new shirt and jacket from a target bag
a moment later now dressed john stuffs the trash bag full of cash into his backpack
john steps out of the bathroom zipping his new jacket
he barely draws a look from the few customers as he limps out of the restaurant
cut to black
water streams from the house the front door and windows broken by firemen who now pack up their gear to leave
lieutenant nabulsi strides into shot drinking a red bull which he crushes and discards on the porch
nabulsi climbs the stairs to find sgt
harris watching the csi team work
nabulsi steps up behind the csi worker
almost a whisper get out of my way
the man flees like he just saw the prince of darkness
nabulsi cocks his head and looks down at the dead man
what do we have
meth lab in the basement the house still standing
should be just a crater
straddles alex do we know him
alex gaidar history of violence and drug trafficking
nabulsi sees the brightly painted walls of the childs room
he have a kid
neighbor said wife left with him last year
big surprise there
they type all this blood yet
no but someone left through the back door bleeding
zone three found a gunshot victim dead on a transit bench
nabulsi nods and descends the stairs
john snips the links of a tall chainlink fence then turns and walks back to the prius
john eases open his parents front door and removes his key from the lock
its the middle of the night so he is surprised to see a light on in the kitchen
he enters carrying his jacket and backpack and places them on a chair
when he gets to the kitchen he sees his father in his pajamas reading a biography and sipping a cup of tea
what are you doing up
an uncomfortable silence
ive come to get luke
after another silence john starts down the hall
his father appears in the hallway behind him
are you alright
john turns around surprised
the two men look at each other for a moment john leaves the room
his father steps into the living room and notices his jacket falling off the chair
george lifts it to set it right and sees something is sticking out of the backpack airplane tickets and passports
john steps into the room that he had as a teenager
luke sleeps in the single bed
john sits beside him touches his face then looks around the room wondering how he got here and is overwhelmed
george slips the tickets and passports out of the side pocket
we do not see the destination but he does
he opens the passport and reads each of the false names
john brushes away tears no idea how he could be acting like this
he tries to wake luke
not a chance
john checks the old alarm clock its just after three am
he lies down beside luke for just a moment
john wakes to the sound of a whistle
he checks the clock
its almost five
how could that have happened
john helps a sleepy luke with his jacket pancake rolled in his hand
john stands from the table strewn with food
what do you say
give grandma a big kiss
im too tired to kiss
ill get lots of kisses next weekend
to john we want to take him to the harvest festival in kutztown where they have the clydesdales
john thinks about saying something cant
he watches luke give grace a kiss
thank you grandma
john turns to his father who stands in the doorway
his father holds out the jacket in silence
john takes it
the airline tickets stick out from the inside pocket
john realizes the tickets have been moved from the bag
he looks at his father who gazes back at him in silence
john can tell by the look in his fathers eye that he knows
johns father stands behind him
george grabs his son in an awkward hug
john is shocked
he pats his fathers back
to luke lets go
the front door closes
grace walks away
john stands in the brightly lit glass walled kiosk of a rental car company the prius parked at the curb as the sun threatens to break over the horizon
nabulsi kneels beside a fire hydrant using a shard from a taillight to scrape at a smudge of flaking black paint
harris comes running up out of breath from the alley
neighbors saw a guy and a dog chase a black car down the alley so thats probably his
well have the taillight debris at the lab by the time it opens
nabulsi stands and hands him the large shard of glass
john packs a backpack two white lab coats wire cutters a large screwdriver two rolls of duct tape the handgun insulin vials etc
luke sits on his bedroom floor trying to cram a firetruck into his already full rollerboard
calls can i carry it
john appears with a box of trash bags
just what fits in your bag
john hurries off
what about my pockets
or your pockets
luke gives up on the truck and moves to his bedside table
he digs his hand into the small jar of coins his dad gave him and starts stuffing them in his pants pocket
a quarter falls and rolls to the middle of the floor
john takes a thick felt marker and writes two numbers on his wrist right beside the watch
and under it
he then turns and stares at his wall all the photos sketches notes wondering if hes forgotten anything
he decides it is too late to worry
he loosens an edge of wallpaper and starts tearing it all down
luke sits in the back seat with their carry on bags
john tries to stuff all the garbage bags full of paper into the back
he picks the last off the floor and turns and walks out to the alley
he looks around then stuffs this final bag into his neighbors trash can
john tosses the last trash bags over the side of the dumpster that sits in front of a demolished house
as he closes the tailgate we get a good look at the broken taillight
he checks the clock on the dashboard and drives faster taking a quick glance at his son to see if he is okay back there
john sits in his car in the back alley watching the parking lot
the driver comes out carrying trays of test results and puts them in the back of his van
john grabs the large wire cutters and screwdriver from his car and hops out
he takes a few steps to the rear of the one story building pries open the phone box and snips the phone wires
a clerk on the phone is cut off
she jabs the connection key does not get a dial tone looks to the lights on the other phone lines and sees them go out as
john snips the last wire and hops back into the car
he is moving before the van exits the parking lot
the van driver hops out and heads into the nursing home as the prius pulls into the foreground
john turns to luke
daddy will just be a minute
john grabs his tennis ball
john holds his lab results between his teeth as he flips through the envelopes
he finally finds laras envelope removes her report and replaces it with this one
we watch through the windshield of the prius as the lab van drives off in the direction of the prison
john tugs carries birthday invitation from his pocket flips it open checks the handwritten address
harris enters lt
nabulsis cubicle to find him standing
taillight matches any prius
with a certain disgust what kind of a criminal drives a prius
a socially responsible one
avoids nabulsis searing look by reading the report over a thousand of them registered in the city seven thousand in the state
how many registered to felons
six in the state
four of them to embezzlers or white collar criminals one to a rapist one to a murderer
guess we start with the murderer
shes in prison for life
the rapist is out
john stands with luke who holds a hand wrapped gift
luke knocks at the front door of a lovely small house
they see nicole in the side yard spreading a paper tablecloth
they move to help keep the tablecloth from blowing away
good to see you
hands her present its a pony
those arent easy to wrap
now awkward you know the party is at eleven right
what time is it
checks watch nine
oh im so sorry i should have looked more carefully

luke spots carrie on the back step and runs over
well i guess you can help
actually i cant stay
i have to run some errands
recovering with grace well see you later then
thanks so much
a moment if
john looks to luke and realizes this might be the last time he sees him
he has my parents phone number in his pocket
in case im late
john throws one more look at luke then walks off
the driver steps out of the prison and returns to the lab van carrying his tray
enters with reports rapist is in a wheelchair
not sure if that was karma or the murderer
where is she incarcerated
checks papers in his hand county right here in town
after mulling this over she have a husband or kid old enough to drive
harris exits knowing he should have checked
the male nurse re reads the test results
lifson approaches having been summoned
handing it to her lara brennans bloodwork
scans now concerned get the lab
the phone repairman is reconnecting the wires speaking to the technician who discovered the lines were dead
you pissed off somebody thats for sure
close on the wires he twists the second last pair now connects the last as the male nurse hangs up
ill try again
studying bloodwork no
get an ambulance take her to university
ill meet them there
lara looks up as her door opens and is surprised to see two female jail guards with a wheelchair
the prius pulls up and john waits and watches
he checks the clock it clicks over to
enters with paper husband
rising you got a home address
the two female guards pass off lara to two male jail guards who load lara into an ambulance
jail guard steps into the back of the ambulance with her
the ambulance pulls out accompanied by a county sheriffs car
handcuffed and shackled lara stares lifelessly at her guard as the emt connects the leads of a heart monitor
knowing where they are going now john passes the ambulance and escort vehicle
nabulsi peers in the window
harris comes up the side from the back
no car in the garage
you want to get a warrant
nabulsi reluctantly slips a credit card into the door jam
harris looks around to check no one is watching
the front door pops open and nabulsi and harris step in
they quickly see that all the furniture is gone
nabulsi joins harris who is staring at the wall where the wallpaper has been removed
get the warrant
the sheriffs car and ambulance pull into the underground entrance
guard steps from the passenger seat of the ambulance and surveys the surroundings shotgun in hand before he knocks on the rear door of the ambulance
they follow procedure in taking the prisoner into the hospital
the sheriff watches until they are safe inside then leaves
nabulsi inspects lukes room still fully furnished the curious faded crayon drawing on the wall
he spots a couple of coins on the floor
he picks up a quarter and flips it
harris steps into the room
shes being transferred to university hospital
have them call the escort vehicle
tell them well meet them at the hospital in less than ten
and he pockets the quarter and steps out of the room
the emt and two jail guards wheel lara up to the desk and hand over her chart
we have lara brennan
the duty nurse checks her chart and nods to a nurse
put her in and start an iv
the emt passes her over to the nurse and leaves
the duty nurse picks up the phone as they move off down the hall
into phone can you please page dr
the nurse wheels her in and guard uncuffs her from the gurney as guard gets a call on his cell phone
were here prisoners secure no problems
he hangs up and turns to see john enter carrying lukes backpack wearing a white doctors smock
he raises a gun
put the phone down
oh please no
remove your holsters put them on the floor and get on your knees
cant make sense of this what are you doing here
guard reaches for his weapon john pistol whips him to the floor
the nurse cups a hand over her mouth to stifle a scream
harris speeds toward the hospital
nabulsi is on the radio
lieutenant the prisoner is secure jail personnel are code
a squad car will meet you at the entrance
nabulsi puts the walkie down and flips on the siren
she just said run the light
a second handgun and holster slides across the floor to meet the one that already lies by johns feet
the two guards kneel facing the far wall
john pulls a roll of duct tape from the backpack and tosses it to the terrified nurse
tape their hands and feet
when he hesitates do it
the nurse tapes the guards wrists behind their backs
you have to stop this
you walk out that door with him and you will both be killed
tape their mouths
john picks up the key and undoes laras cuffs
john yanks her clothing and a white smock out of the bag and tosses them to her
put it on
because we have no other choice
put it on
to nurse turn around
he does john starts taping his wrists
lara put the clothes on
they stare at each other
john offers her his cell phone
tell your son you arent coming
where is he
waiting for you
tell him you arent coming
how can you do this to me
tell him im not coming back either
john does it look like im going home
tell him he is alone now and his mother and father arent coming back
lara stares at him with hatred mutters you son of a bitch
lara pulls off her prison garb standing before them naked except for her panties
she quite purposely does not turn away or cover herself but lets her eyes burn into him
john presses the stopwatch button on his watch and the counter starts running
a squad car pulls up outside the hospitals main entrance
one officer strides into the emergency room while the other takes a look around the parking lot
lara and john step out into the hall
johns eyes flick to the nurses desk but he keeps walking
as they pass we notice dr
lifson standing there with laras file in her hand
the duty nurse notices as well
it takes a second for lifson to understand what is going on
she steps out into the hall and stares after them
what are you doing
john yanks laras arm and makes a dash for the elevator pulling his gun from his pocket
the duty nurse sees what is happening and bolts down the hall throwing open the door to room
the elevator doors are closing as john arrives and jams his arm in between them
the passengers see the weapon
they scurry out and the doors close
a heartbeat later the next elevator opens and the cop from downstairs steps off
is he safe
where is he
the unmarked car brakes hard
nabulsi and harris stride out and into the er flipping their id into their breast pockets
lara and john barely breath
the uniformed officer who stayed outside finds johns black prius with the broken taillight parked in a handicapped spot
he lifts his walkie and calls it in
nabulsi jabs the elevator button
he reacts as a hospital security guard comes running toward him
before he can answer the elevator doors open and they come face to face with john and lara
john sees their police ids and levels his weapon
around them patients and employees scream and run away
dont be stupid
drop the weapon
we have units at every exit
youll be shot trying to leave
to lara hit the button
lara stands frozen
she presses a button
the doors start to close
dont do this
nabulsi runs and screams where are the stairs
hospital security guard leads the way
nabulsi and harris pass him at the door as he yells into his walkie
male and female white lab coats
freaking out oh please oh please oh please
itll be okay
she keeps panicking look at me
do what i say itll be okay i promise
she stares at him having never seen him like this before
take the coat off
nabulsi harris and the guard bound down the stairs into the lower elevator lobby
nabulsi sees the doors arent opening and runs back to the stairs meeting the cop from upstairs on his way down
into walkie parking garage
get your asses down here
nabulsi and harris leave them and thunder down the stairs
the elevator doors open and john tosses the lab coats out toward a trash can in the direction of the garage
he pounds the elevator button
nabulsi and harris burst onto this floor see the elevator doors are closed
watch that door
harris obeys as nabulsi flings himself down the next flight
the elevator isnt closing
john slams the button repeatedly
he hears nabulsis heavy feet on the stairs angles and aims the weapon lara cant believe what shes witnessing
suddenly the doors close just a heartbeat before nabulsi gets there
nabulsi spots the discarded lab coats and runs out into the garage
he heads for the ramp scanning the parked cars
getting to the bottom of the ramp he looks up and sees a squad car racing down toward him
as it brakes nabulsi realizes they couldnt have escaped this way hes been had
shouts into walkie whos in the lobby
but he only gets static
he charges back toward the stairs
the doors open
john peers around the corner hiding his weapon
no police in the lobby but through the glass doors he sees a squad car screeching to a halt
he grabs laras hand and leads her out of the elevator and around the corner
they weave down a corridor deeper into the hospital passing another cop at the emergency desk who has his back to them
they turn the corner see a hospital guard running toward them
john recognizes him as the guard he argued with when lara attempted suicide
john stiffens but the guard runs past looking for a couple in lab coats
they quicken their steps
the guard stops at the end of the hall and turns to stare recognizing them
he lifts his walkie and speaks
main floor rear corridor
john and lara turn a corner
john spots the shipping office
they enter and head for the loading bay
nabulsi and harris break into the lobby sweating
officers run in the front doors toward him
nabulsi surveys the scene realizes they couldnt have gone out the front
he hears a shout back here
they turn and run in the direction of the voice turning the corner and seeing the security guard at the end of the hall who sees them coming turns and
runs off after john and lara
into radio on the run get units to grant street
john punches open the door and they hop down off the dock and take off for the street
john tugs lara across the street dodging traffic
he yanks off his jacket and pulls it back on inside out this side is black and gold
nabulsi runs out of the loading dock and into the middle of grant street harris and the two officers trailing
very few pedestrians right here
nabulsi looks to his right a crowded crosswalk fans heading through a pedestrian mall to a penguins game
he looks to his left more fans moving toward the stadium
almost all of them are wearing team colors a sea of black and gold
lara and john weave through the fans
put your hair down
lara obeys without thinking
john checks his watch then opens a door
leaving the throng of fans he guides lara through and down the stairs into the t train subway station
nabulsi runs to the crosswalk as harris takes the other direction
the other two officers take the far sidewalks
john and lara quicken their pace
the camera tilts up and to the glass ceiling
nabulsi searches the faces in the mall
he looks down through the station skylight catches a fleeting glimpse of them
he runs for the entrance his walkie flying to his face
theyre on the platform
block stations in either direction
call the port authority
stop all trains
john sees a train approaching as they come down the stairs
almost dragging lara john nudges past slower people to make it onto the train
then they wait
the doors dont close
walkie in hand harris jumps into their unmarked car and pulls out
two squad cars wail out past him
above nabulsi sees the train and shoves past commuters
john spots him coming slips the long screwdriver from the small backpack hes carrying
lara sees him tighten his fingers around the grip
the doors finally close just as nabulsi bounds down the stairs
the train leaves the station
nabulsi leaps down onto the tracks and chases it
this station sits above ground
three squad cars scream up
the officers clamor out of the cars and run for the platform
harris skids the unmarked vehicle around the corner heading parallel to the underground
nabulsi runs down the tracks the car ahead nowhere in sight
the t train driver gets an emergency call from the base
he looks back into the car as it rises up out of the underground
daylight floods the car as the train emerges from underground
john jams the long screwdriver into the door and pries it the wheels screech and the brakes seize
passengers topple to the floor
john grabs lara and they leap out onto the tracks
he finds the slit he cut in the tall fence
they slip out through it onto the street and into the parking lot beyond
harris screams along the road on the far side of the tracks
he locks up his brakes as he sees the stalled t train
john yanks off his jacket as they jump into the rented suv
john calms his racing heart drives away and turns the corner
harris leaps from his vehicle and runs to the fence on his side of the tracks it is ten feet tall with razor wire no way over it
he sees nabulsi charge up out of the tunnel
he jumps into the stalled train car looks around doesnt see john and lara
the suv comes up out of the dark and drives away from the city center as a police helicopter swoops overhead going the opposite direction
john checks the counter still running on his watch
he wets his thumb and rubs his wrist until the is erased
all that remains now is the second number
they merge into traffic heading toward the suburbs
nabulsi pushes through the hole in the wire
harris runs across the tracks with his jacket off having scaled the fence on the far side
into walkie ring the city
train and bus stations
get their descriptions to the state police
to harris how old is their kid
lets find out where he is
why didnt you tell me
you wouldve stopped me
he nods toward the glove box theres a case in there
brush moisturizer makeup
everything you had was old
i hope i got it right
she opens the glove box unzips the case and is touched by this small gesture
detective collero who we last saw when they arrested lara stops by detective quinns cubicle
you want to take a guess who just escaped from jail
lara sits in the suv at the curb
john waits at the door
it is opened by brenda nicoles mother
im here for my son
oh they arent back yet
back from where
finds an invite and hands it to him
the back clearly says they are going to the zoo
its a zoo party
in case hes worried they ate first
they should be back in about an hour
would you like to wait
john turns and walks back to the suv
brenda watches for a moment made curious by his behavior
he gets into the vehicle
lara is in a panic
john punches zoo into points of interest on the gps
hes at the party
he sneaks a look at his stopwatch minutes and counting
you said the party was here
i was wrong
she took them to the zoo
the gps comes up with an address
john punches a button
cant help herself she
estimated drive time seventeen minutes
he drops the transmission into gear and speeds off
a squad car is waiting another arrives
harris pulls up and strides toward the house
canvas the neighbors
were looking for the boy and anything theyve noticed in the last few days
john drives like a man possessed
john brakes as he spots a state trooper vehicle at an intersection
as he keeps an eye on the rearview mirror the squad car puts on its flashers turns and follows them
johns hands tighten on the wheel
he keeps the speedometer at praying hes not their target
the police vehicle passes them and takes off fast down the four lane street
john breathes again and drives on
he checks the stopwatch minutes flicks to
he pushes the button on the gps
time to destination eleven minutes
lara sees him sweat unaware of the significance of the time
the suv swerves around a corner heading into the outskirts of town
johns eyes flick to his stopwatch minutes flicks to
signs appear quickly now
interstate keep right zoo next left
john keeps driving hoping somehow that he wont have to make this choice their freedom or their son
too many questions rage across his face
perhaps they can escape and his parents can somehow arrange to get luke to them
or perhaps luke would be better off with his grandparents after all
then there it is the sign to the interstate points to the entrance ahead on the right
the sign to the zoo sits behind it pointing to the next road on the left
john takes the freeway ramp
the suv climbs up the on ramp leaving the city behind
you took the wrong turn
its back there
lara looks back over her shoulder wondering if this is some kind of shortcut
the zoo is back there
youre going the wrong way
no response its back there
no response shell call my parents
theyll take care of him i will figure out how to get him to us
are you out of your mind
theres no more time
any second now theres going to be a roadblock ahead
it might be there now
if we dont get out now we dont get out
lara sits back in her seat stunned and horrified as john continues
i promise i will find a way to get luke to us
i will find some way
lara unsnaps her seat belt
she reaches for the door latch
john sees her pull the door and grabs her by the shirt as he slams his foot on the brakes
the tires scream the suv skids into an uncontrolled turn
cars behind them swerve to avoid collision
john holds lara in her seat as the suv flies around in a circle and finally comes to a dead stop on the shoulder miraculously facing in the right direction
john allows himself to breathe
he lets go of laras shirt
she opens the door and steps out
john closes his eyes and tries to gather himself back together
he opens his door and steps out
john sees the big rig truck driver look back from where hes pulled over
john nods to him that everything is okay and comes around the bumper to find lara sitting on the gravel shoulder leaning against the back tire staring out at the
he sits beside her in silence
behind them the cars whip by
no one even thinks to stop to see if they need help
lara and john watch a cow in the farmers field
there is nothing for either of them to say they both know how they got here
their hands sit on the gravel between each other
without looking at him lara tentatively entwines a single finger with his
he slowly gathers strength from her touch
they close the doors and john starts the engine and they drive forward
john takes the first exit
a garbage truck is just pulling up as paula shows harris and an officer her recycling bin
they pull out johns overstuffed trash bag
lara sits in the suv by herself watching the entrance
nicole surrounded by a dozen six year olds passes luke off to john
no it really is fine
i cant thank you enough for taking care of him
it is our pleasure
wasnt it carrie
john and luke turn and walk toward the exit
lara turns and sees john and luke walking toward her
did you have a nice time at the party
lara walks him to the car as if this day is no different than any other
what was your favorite thing
ice cream cake
she lifts him into his seat and buckles him in
they had ice cream cake here
at carries house
lots of flavors
john starts the car
im going to sit back here okay
luke plays with a toy
lara closes the door behind her
she looks out the window and sees nicole standing at the entrance looking at her
not exactly sure why she does it lara offers her a grateful smile
nicole watches them pull away confused about what she should do
john drifts up to the stop sign at the intersection
a sign points out the interstate to the left and he can see the overpass and freeway entrance the business district to the right
he checks his watch minutes
he resets it to zero
he switches on the radio and searches for news
luke taps lara on the shoulder
she leans down
i think were going to the cottage
he nods knowingly
i have money
lara almost loses it smiles
then ill stick close to you
john finds the news station
traffic down to two lanes at the tollbooths
and downtown is worse
stay away from the train station if you are trying to get anywhere
not sure what is happening but a kpgh caller says trains arent moving and commuters are getting irate
no reply what are we going to do
finally were going to the train station
john turns right heading downtown
detective quinn spots harris fly in carrying a brimming green trash bag
quinn jumps up and follows him into the situation room
collero hurries to catch up
harris dumps the contents onto the conference table as she enters
quinn immediately dives into the contents
harris and collero share an awkward look
casting her eyes down hi
she and harris dig into the crumpled papers and photos
to collero youre not going to nod off are you
collero gives quinn a burning look
john double parks and pulls on a ball cap
traffic is snarled the place is awash with police and squad cars
hundreds of people mill out front
stay in the car
john puts on his sunglasses and walks right through the middle of it all
lara watches certain he will be spotted and arrested
john steps onto the crowded sidewalk outside the front doors
he speaks to a large woman she shakes her head
he goes on to speak to a black couple who apparently arent interested
he approaches an elderly couple
the suv heads up the on ramp
nabulsi is on the phone catching hell from his captain who has had an earful from his counterpart in the state police
i didnt tell them to stop every vehicle
just the ones with a couple and a young child
he hangs up takes the quarter from his pocket and spins it on his desk
john spies the tollbooth ahead traffic down to two lanes
the elderly man beside him has a small bag on his lap
are you sure twenty dollars is enough
ticket to buffalo costs three times that
and now we notice the mans wife sitting in the back seat with luke and lara
john pays the toll
re suv this thing is very good on gas
a state trooper waves them toward the booth
the trooper ahead checks them out and waves them on
they are free
the same trooper stops the car behind them in it a couple with a child
every one in the state
send their photos to every train bus station and airport in a three hundred mile radius
looking at her pad so ohio maryland west virginia new york new jersey virginia michigan kentucky and indiana
you know what direction they are going smart ass
captain a lot of these places barely have fax machines
then start dialing
as they exit prioritize
closest airports first
nabulsi spins the quarter again staring at it as if it will give him the answer
the brennans drop off the elderly couple
john waves drops his gun in the trash can gets back in and drives away
harris and collero finish recreating a portion of johns wall complete with wallpaper
harris steps out into the hall passing an interview room
behind the glass he sees quinn grilling mick
harris keeps going into nabulsis office
nabulsi sits spinning the coin jacket off shirt untucked
you want to see it
only if it will tell me where they are
not so lucky
nabulsi flattens the coin
something makes him stare at his fingers
he moves his hand revealing a canadian quarter
how far is it to the canadian border
four five hours
the suv takes the freeway exit and climbs the ramp
nabulsi comes out of his office passing a waiting erit
you call this coffee
nabulsi shakes that off and enters the situation room
every phone at the table is manned all having the same conversation im calling from the pittsburgh police department
we have a fugitive warrant for lara and john brennan they are most likely traveling with their six year old son and we have reason to believe they might be
flying out of your airport
collero hangs up from her call and looks to the next number
how many airports in ontario and quebec
should i stop calling and count
nabulsi gives her a look
yes we are sending you photographs
we would appreciate it if you could disseminate them
how many terminals
bursts in i got his parents
the brennans enter pulling their carry on bags
as she types long way to go with just carry on
smiles you know how many times youve lost our bags
i hear you
john and lara wait for luke to step through the metal detector
the alarm sounds
john and lara react as the security agent takes luke into the glass isolation booth
collero questions grace on the other side of the glass
she appears devastated
so you just decided to go for a drive for the entire day
george wanted to see the leaves

george stares nabulsi down
a female security agent searches luke digs a handful of canadian quarters out of his pocket
johns heart races
the brennans approach passport control
lara glances at john sees he is sweating and red
she slips her hand into his and takes the passports
ill do this
she turns and smiles at the officer putting on all her charm
he remains stern faced
taking their passports he examines them against photographs on his computer screen
he looks at them looks at the passports again then finally waves them through
as they step away the passport officer turns sees his replacement waiting
he stands and exits to take his break
the second passport control officer takes his seat and motions for the next traveler to approach
as they do an alert comes on his computer screen
he taps on it and up comes photographs of lara and john
he notes them taps the screen again and the two take their place beside the others on the watch list
he motions for the traveler to hand over her passport
the phones are quiet
alone harris stares at the portion of the wall that he assembled
too bad you didnt find more of it
and wish i could figure out where this is
he points to a small torn photo taped back together
i checked websites for every tourist destination i could thats the presidential palace
harris turns stares it was all over cnn
when they deposed

harris bursts in

john and lara sit waiting to board luke asleep
well now begin boarding by rows
an airport security chief snatches photos of lara and john out of the printer and bolts out of the office joined by two other officers
john lara and luke walk down the jetway until they are stopped by the crowd of passengers before them
john tries not to show how nervous he really is
airport security runs up to the gate and pushes past the boarding passengers searching their faces
the airport security chief strides past the passengers and onto the jetway the pages of photographs in his hand
nabulsi waits in silence on the other end of a phone
the room is full no one speaks
a second airport security officer squeezes along the wall passing the waiting passengers
we pan to see lukes brightly colored roller board
our hearts stop it is all over
nabulsi waits on the other line for an eternity
there is no one by their description on the flight
theyre on it

nabulsi hangs up defeated
quinn stares out the window deep in thought
its starting to rain
nabulsi looks at him as if hes nuts
ill call the fbi
collero exits quinn turns and looks at the partial wall
you ask yourself why we found this bag and not the others
lara looks up from her son sees her husband staring out the window at the darkness beyond
the captain has switched off the seat belt light
flight time to caracas venezuela this evening is five hours and fifteen minutes
while in your seat the captain asks now its just harris and nabulsi staring at johns wall
this guy was a teacher
at a community college
sitting in his pajamas george flips open an ancient atlas and runs his finger down across the gulf of mexico to caracas venezuela
and he thinks of his grandson and smiles
a taxi snakes along a mountain road through the dense forests of venezuela
exhausted but awake john stares out the window at the coastline below
lara and luke sleep beside him
detective quinn squats in the covered parking lot staring at the spot where the crime took place
flash to elizabeth turns at her car is slammed in the head with the extinguisher and she falls dead
the extinguisher is tossed to the floor and rolls
a young female junkie yanks at elizabeths purse getting blood on her hands before she frees it
she looks like a junkie
she runs off toward the sidewalk
turns and sees
she hurries along the sidewalk to get out of the rain
turning the corner into the garage she collides with the junkie
laras purse catches the womans coat
the junkie puts her hand on laras shoulder leaving a smudge of elizabeths blood on laras raincoat
she tugs free
a button from the womans coat pops off and hits the sidewalk
lara turns and yells hey then keeps going
she is about to get in the car when she sees the fire extinguisher in front of her left wheel
she picks it up turns annoyed
she places it down by the wall
lara gets in her car and drives off oblivious to elizabeths body lying on the concrete floor on the passengers side
her co worker sees her drive off as he steps into the garage
he spots the body and turns and looks after laras car
quinn puts his used gum in a wrapper
collero watches from the car as her partner walks to the corner of the building
quinn steps up to where the two women collided and looks down at the sidewalk
was it raining when we searched the crime scene
three years ago
what are we doing here
quinn drops his gum wrapper onto the sidewalk
it hits a stream of water coming out from a rain gutter and washes away
quinn watches it then follows
collero shakes her head grabs a newspaper to keep the rain off and follows
the gum wrapper washes over the curb into the gutter and travels to the storm drain a half a block away
quinn gets there kneels
act like a cop
grab the other side
youre out of your mind
quinn jerks the grate up
collero grabs the other side and helps him lift
they stare down into the hole
quinn runs his hand along the lip digging up the mud and sediment
you really thought you were going to find it
collero wipes her hands on a tissue as quinn stares down the hole a little longer then lets the grate fall
just before the grate clangs we see junkies jacket button squeezed between the grate and the wall
the taxi crosses the ancient square of a small town
the room has two single beds
john waits at the bathroom door
lara steps out a real awkwardness between them
she touches his hand
he offers a smile
she slips past him
he steps into the bathroom and closes the door
lara lies down on the single bed furthest from the bathroom face to face with her sleeping son
without warning he kisses her on the cheek for the first time without being prodded
he turns around and lets her wrap her arms around him
and she almost dies of happiness
john washes trying not to look in the mirror not wanting to glimpse the man he has become
lara and luke sleep spooning
john sits on the other bed
he picks up the tv remote and flips through spanish language stations
and there it is cnn in english
sports right now but john knows there is no place they can hide
damon takes the money from johns wallet leaves him with a twenty
damon leaves him there
as john wonders if he is capable of doing this we cut to black
read hear knock knock
