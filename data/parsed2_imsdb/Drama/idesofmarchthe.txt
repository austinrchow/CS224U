written by george clooney grant heslov beau willimon stephen meyers press secretary to governor morris is standing at a podium on a stage
there is a single spotlight on him
the rest of the stage is dark
stephen is talking into a mic with no emotion
just matter of factly
i am neither christian
i am not jewish or muslim
what i believe
my religion is called the constitution
stephen snaps his fingers in the mic
we hear the distinct sound of feedback getting louder until it stops
we hear the director speak over the loud speaker
let me open these up
we wait as stephen looks around
he looks at stage hands who are busy working
no one pays any attention to him as he stands there
this isnt awkward for stephen this is okay
lights come up on another podium revealing a debate stage
i will defend till my dying breath your right to worship whatever god you believe in
the lights on stephens podium go out hes in the dark
he keeps going
if im not religious enough for you dont vote for me
to the director
you got it
his podium light comes back on
no answer from the director stephen continues
if im not experienced enough dont vote for me
if im not
okay got it thanks
well need these monitors turned up a bit
its a big space and he wants to be able to hear
you got it
also well need these podiums put on a riser as we agreed to in the pre conditions
youre a few inches short and it makes it harder for the governor to read his notes
no i know we just got those specs last night and theyre building a piece to go under
see you guys in a few hours
we see were in an auditorium of a college
stephen meets up with ben harpen his staffer
i didnt know the governor had trouble reading his notes
why doesnt he wear
he doesnt but pullman is hell look like a hobbit behind that podium
they walk off
rob braun a local cincinnati anchor talks to camera as we see stephen and ben exit the building
under this we hear rachel maddow reporting
well it all comes down to this
we are one week away from the ohio primary
camera now moves past rob to another news truck where an msnbc reporter stands in front of a camera waiting to go live
there is a monitor in front of him
the camera keeps moving into the monitor where rachel maddow does the lead in
as rachels audio continues we see the following images
we cruise along a snow covered rural landscape flat gray desolate
in the distance we see a barn with huge red white and blue letters painted on the side
they read ohio for two democrats are left standing
senator pullman of arkansas who is trailing governor morris from pennsylvania
moments later we roll past another farm with a large billboard staked into the ground beside the road pullman americas future begins on march th
we cut to canvassers bundled to the hilt against the cold knocking on doors in a suburban neighborhood
yard signs for both candidates line the street
governor morris has mounted a sizable lead with delegates winning new hampshire california new york and michigan
but senator pullman with delegates is still in the hunt having won florida tennessee virginia and missouri
supporters at an intersection waving hand made signs to cars honk for morris
a passing car lays on the horn and the supporters cheer
a win in ohio could turn it all around for the arkansas senator
close up of a pullman bumper sticker on an suv at a stoplight right next to a my child is an honor student decal
so one week from tuesday the all important hundred and eighty one ohio delegates could be the deciding factor
a clerk placing a morris sign in the store window
in the shop next door various tvs are in a window display
we see rachel maddows report on them
and once again the old adage is true
as goes ohio so goes the nation
we see satellite trucks press vehicles police cars etc
at a catering truck molly stearns a year old intern grabs a tray of coffees and a box of doughnuts
we stay on her as she runs across the street and through a door
molly enters and we follow her through the campaign war room its the size of a coffin jammed to the hilt with twenty something staffers manning laptops
were in the hustle and bustle of a live telecast
we see multiple angles of the telecast
would you call yourself a christian
how would that matter
i have no idea what happens when we die maybe nothing
maybe it was like before we were born
you did write this governor
then let me try and clarify
i was raised catholic i am not a practicing catholic
i have no idea what happens when you die and if the senator does then perhaps he should be president
ill even vote for him
the audience laughs
is that your idea of being specific
molly passes out coffee
were now live inside the debate
let me be more specific
i am neither a christian nor an atheist im not jewish or muslim
what i believe
my religion is written on a piece of parchment called the constitution
meaning i will defend till my dying breath your right to worship in whatever god or lack thereof you believe in as long as it doesnt hurt others
i believe we should be judged as a government by how we take care of those who cant take care of themselves
thats my religion
if you feel that im not religious enough then dont vote for me
if you feel im not experienced enough or tall enough then dont vote for me
because im not going to change those to get elected
i just wanted you to say out loud if you believed in the teachings of the bible
is this a democratic primary or a general election
well governor whoever wins this contest will be running for president
and if you dont think that these questions wont be central in a general election then you are living in fantasy land
i applaud your honesty governor i do
im simply pointing to what is obvious
we are running for president of the united states
not for student council president
paul zara morriss campaign manager is waiting in the wings off stage
stephen sidles up next to him
in the background we can see the candidates shaking hands
there is applause
paul is pushing fifty with the grizzled look of a hardened campaign veteran
hes stephens boss the only guy between him and governor morris
arms crossed they watch their man on stage
fucking national security
the governor looks off stage to paul and stephen for approval
outta the park
we hear the announcer thanking everyone for attending the debate
tom duffy campaign manager of the rival pullman campaign is also watching from the wings
duffys smooth calculated and icy
he walks over to stephen and paul
im trying to remember if the democrats ever nominated an atheist before
well we know theyve nominated jackasses before
mustve been you that did the prep work
pauls not that clever
you always had the brains duffy but me i always had the balls
nodding to stephen looks like you got some brains now too
i just might have to steal him from you
duffy walks off to greet senator pullman as he makes his way to the wings
paul and stephen eye him as he goes
what a prick
stephen paul ida and ben are having drinks around a table
the mood is festive
there is a piano player playing singing
paul has a roll away suitcase beside him
so paul tell me something i dont know
tell me whats gonna happen on the th
what do you think stevie
its ours for the taking
what do you think ida
im asking you
you tell me and ill tell you
if had to say id say itll be close but youll eke it out
you see shes trying to get under my skin
so whats gonna happen
us by nine
theres no way youll win by nine
to paul so youre certain youre gonna win here
you just said youll win by nine
and i think we will but i wont tell you its a sure thing
fucking saint gabriel can blow his horn on election day and get his four horseman to rig the ballot boxes for pullman and it wouldnt surprise me
dont get me wrong
six presidentials ive done and ive never felt this good
but am i gonna sit here and say yes we will definitely win ohio
not a chance
in the last thirty years seventy three democrats have run for president
how many have won
that means seventy guys ran who thought they had a chance and they all lost
so youre saying theres a good chance you wont win
dont twist my words
what im saying is that im not going to promise well win
but hes decorated by bush senior from the first gulf war and protested the second
he left his state with a balanced budget and the fourth highest education rate
the republicans have nobody out there that can touch this guy
so for this moment this election this primary is the presidential
and that ida is the state of the union
and on that note im gonna take a shit
paul swigs down the rest of his drink and exits
stephen stephen stephen
here it comes
pauls going to the airport
getting on a plane
where is that plane going
not going back to headquarters
hes not going to texas
no need well split texas its a wash
what if i said north carolina
thats your guess
hes going to north carolina
i will neither confirm nor deny that statement
i knew it
now tell me why
that i cannot do
i hate you
you love me
i love paul
you i hate
you only love him because he gives you all the scoops
if it meant a good scoop my fiance would understand
you really buy into all this crap
all this take back the country nonsense
ida im not naive about this stuff
ive worked on more campaigns than most people do by the time theyre forty
im telling you this is the one
you really have drunk the kool aid
i have drunk it its delicious
i dont care whether he leads in the polls
i dont care whether he has all the tools
because the truth is hes the only one thats going to make a difference in peoples lives
even the people that hate him
if mike morris is president it says more about us than it does about him
i dont give a fuck if he can win
he has to win
the world will fall apart
it wont matter
not one bit to the everyday lives of everyday fuckers who work and eat and sleep and get up and go back to work again
if your boy wins
you get a job in the white house
if he loses youre back at a consulting firm on k street
you used to know that before you got all goosebumpy about this guy
morris is a politician
hes a nice guy
theyre all nice guys
he will let you down
sooner or later
ida and paul walk to idas car
this is off off off the record
off the record
the only people who know are the governor stephen and me
my lips are sealed
i have a meeting tomorrow at thompsons house
hes gonna endorse
after im done talking with him what do you think
its more than huge
he has pledged delegates
they all travel with him
that puts us over the top
hes said publicly hes not gonna endorse anyone
thats what they all say until we get them alone in a room
so this is for real
its just about in the bag
when are you gonna announce
thats all you get for now
ben walks around to all the staffers he hands out new cell phones
okay so listen up
these are your new cell phones
shelly has pre programmed everyones numbers in
thank you shelly
no personal calls
if you lose them paul has authorized me to kill you
ben walks into stephens office and hands him his new phone
ill get it in a bit
as ben leaves we see that stephen is looking at early footage of governor morris
another staffer and an editor are watching it with him
outside the office we can see other staffers through the glass partitions running around in campaign mode
we see some of the footage
ive got to believe we can do it
we have enemies
we have to understand why our enemies are our enemies and see if there is something we can do about that besides using force
what we know from history is the answer to extremism is not extremism
whoever is the next president whoever steps up has got a lot of work to do but you have a little work to do yourself
stephen hits pause
fucking kill me
where did we get this
before he announced at a town hall meeting in pennsylvania
thank god it wasnt overseas
just get rid of it it plays to his base if are you fucking stoned
this is the same
the exact same piece the republicans are gonna run against him in the general
we dont need to brag about it
hi im neville chamberlain and i want to be your commander in chief
if its gonna come out its gonna come out but not paid for by us pal
to staffer any truth on whether pullman had investments in those diamond mines in liberia
were still checking
it was a blog so who the fuck knows
doesnt matter i want to hear him denying it
if its true find out if its not let them spend the next day telling the post that he doesnt own a diamond mine in liberia
we need to counter this christian shit were taking from last night
so get going
wheres our cut on the new thirty and a sixty second spots
well show it to him this afternoon in the staff meeting
the editor and staffer exit
stephen turns to his computer and types as molly walks in and hands him some papers
ben wanted me to get you to sign off on this before the staff meeting
ive been waiting for this
just some white paper i gotta pass out tonight
our oppo guys do research we feed it to the press hope they bite
so like what sort of negative stuff
read tomorrows paper and youll see
all of them
so its something big
i wish it were something bigger actually
just some transportation numbers
ill have to spin this shit pretty heavy if we want it to stick
well thats what youre good at right
holding up her phone did you get your phone
holds his up just now
its exciting isnt it
he looks at her
you a bearcat
a cincinnati bearcat
im not from here
i worked with you in iowa actually
oh thats right
but you changed something
searching for a way out
you changed your hair
i must look like a total dumb ass right now
not at all
youre the big man on campus
im just a lowly intern
come on its not like that
sure it is
you get to stay at the millennium they put us into a motel on the other side of the river
youre right i am big man on campus
now youre starting to see
she starts to leave
we do have the better bar though
i heard that
you ought to stop by one night and have a drink with the worker bees
maybe i will
whens a good night
yeah its quiet
well you have my number
programmed right there in your phone
he opens the phone under mary
looking at the phone yup
then as she exits molly
my names molly
stephen smiles to himself
we follow a housekeeper down the hallway and into the living room where we see paul sitting with senator thompson
thats what im hearing
since super tuesday im a very popular guy
what are your polls telling you
that pullmans negatives are high
senator we have an open seat in the white house and the republicans dont have dick
theyre disorganized and they cant find a nominee that isnt a world class fuck up
they look like democrats
no republican is gonna show up to vote for their guy
but if pullman gets the democratic nod theyll show up to vote against him
and so you think they wont for your guy
you think morris gets into the independents
i sure do
im a bit confused
we need your delegates
we need you
your fund raising
it was my understanding that
your endorsement a week before ohio
would win this for us
looks to his aide estella
hand me that ice bucket
were in a staff meeting with the brain trust
pauls gone but the rest are there
stephen ben governor morris
molly is running in and out she gets glances from all the guys
ben wheres my op ed on national service
its better for me to work off of that
got it right here
he opens his laptop
get me a hard copy
i hate these fucking things
print it out
ill get it printed
molly im printing out this op ed
can you grab it off the printer
be right back
if you want to change
or lets call it refresh
just give me a second
national service isnt polling like the rest of your domestic policy
i dont give a shit about polling
im not going to play this game with you stephen
and if this is your good cop bad cop act with paul
good cop good cop
im not changing it
molly returns and hands the governor a copy
he reads down until he finds what hes looking for
yeah i said it all here its going to help people get an education
its going to create national unity
its going to teach young people a trade
and its going to help get people out of debt from college loans
tell me where that fails
all of that is exactly right
governor if youre going to do it
then do it
dont make it voluntary
thatll poll well
everyone who graduates high school or turns eighteen gives two years to his or her country
plant fucking trees i dont care
and for that
their college education is paid for
we do all of that now with this
no sir you dont
do it all
all the way
paul likes this
you guys are my brain trust
and heres the beauty of it
everyone who is older than eighteen and past the age of eligibility would be for it
create national pride
give all the kids an education
and all the others
this sits with them
some start to smile
you cant lose
stephen you have a call on three your dad
okay you and ben work it into the stump speech get me a hard copy and ill write it in my own words
you have a six oclock with charlie rose
why am i doing him
its long form
hes flying in
is paul going
no he wont be back
ben and i are taking you
stephen picks up the receiver and pushes line three
dont tell me anyones died
who is this
sorry about the dad bit
but i didnt think youd want my name yelled out at a morris campaign office
stephen gets up and closes the door
what do you want
you got a couple of minutes
id like to sit down with you
i think its important
if its important shouldnt you be calling paul
im calling you
this is all on the up and up
just give me five minutes
i cant be talking to you
i hear you
but if you get five minutes
ill be at the heads first sports bar for the next couple of hours
i cant tom
there wont be anybody there
if you get a chance theres something i want to show you
duffy hangs up
stephen sits for a few beats
he picks up his cell phone and dials
it goes straight to voice mail
paul listen call me as soon as you can
stephen hangs up the phone and we stay with him
stephen sits in the car he watches the door of the bar making sure no one is around
were in a run down bar in cincinnati
the furniture is shabby formica tables cheap metal framed chairs
the place is desolate except for tom and stephen who sit at the bar
youre working for the wrong man
youre working for the wrong man
oh on the contrary you are working for the wrong man
youve got something the other guys dont have
yeah what is it exactly
charm isnt the right word
its more than that
you exude something
you draw people in
all the reporters love you
even the ones that hate you love you
you play them all like theyre pieces on a chess board
and you make it look effortless
we both know how much work it takes constantly being on guard weighing every word so carefully every move
but from the outside you make it look easy
people are scared of you because they dont understand how you do it and they love you for it
theres nothing more valuable in this business the ability to win peoples respect by making them mistake their fear for love
you can guess what im gonna say next
i dont think i can
i want you to work for us
you gotta be kidding me
not in the least
you are going to lose ohio
i am not
youre sitting on about a six percent lead in both polls
six percent of the democrats polled
but that doesnt matter
independents and republicans can vote for the democratic candidate
you think they like your guy
tax and spend liberal
fuck no they hate him
they think they can beat my guy
but theyre worried about yours
so starting tomorrow morning youre gonna see a fucking blitz
rush limbaugh sean hannity all the right wing blogs are gonna start a get out the vote campaign
its already started
every fucking conservative in ohio is gonna stand in line and punch my guys ticket
thats just one of the steps
ohio is gone
the polls dont mean shit
tomorrow morning everyone will know
thats why i want you to handle the fallout well take in the press
they look at each other
and by the way
weve got thompson in the bag
i know for a fact that thompson is going with us
we promised him secretary of state ohio is over
its been over for weeks
and with thompsons delegates
im thinking down the road now
thats why i want you
ill bring you in straight at the top
i cant do it
im not asking for an answer right this moment
ive played dirty but i dont have to play dirty anymore
you know why
cause i got morris
none of this is about the democratic process steve its about getting your guy into office
simple as that
this is the sort of shit the republicans pull
youre right this is exactly what the republicans do and its about time we learned from them
theyre meaner tougher and more disciplined than we are
ive been in this business for twenty five years and ive seen way too many democrats bite the dust because they wouldnt get down in the mud with the fucking
pauls a friend
do you want to work for a friend or do you want to work for the president
think about it
you have my number
duffy gets up and leaves
stephen walks to his car
he dials paul on his phone
paul is in north carolina driving
they dont make quaaludes any more do they
not that i know of
whats going on with thompson
he wants something but well be fine
so whats so important
im on the cell if you need me
i fly to dc tomorrow and back tomorrow night
ill look for quaaludes
stephen ends the call
he stands in silence
were in the bathroom of a hotel room
governor morris is being made up for the charlie rose show
a secret service agent stands in the adjoining room
the governor talks to the make up lady while stephen and ben stand in the adjoining room as well
just get online and see if theres any chatter on the blogs
what kind of chatter
theres always chatter
i dont know
just see what theyre talking about
give me a second
he sets his laptop down and starts typing
the governor whos been talking the whole time yells out through the door
youre still single right
im married to the campaign governor
to the make up girl hes married to the campaign
looking at his computer wall street journal poll has our numbers holding steady and pullman dropped a point
when did they do that
wall street journal numbers are in
and pullmans down a point
now were moving in the right direction
ben are you still single
im married to the campaign governor
to the make up girl crack team
the governor starts to sing the best is yet to come
make sure charlie rose has these latest numbers before he goes on
im on it
and get a copy of the show before we leave
the room has been transformed into an interview space
charlie rose and gov
morris mid interview
is it a difficult decision
i would have to believe that it is
would i do it
but i cant see myself
certainly not a government telling a woman what she can do with her body
so you would appoint a judge to
i would consider it arrogant to judge someone until ive walked in their shoes
but youre against the death penalty
because of what it says about us as a society
suppose governor it was your wife
and she was murdered what would i do
it gets more complicated when its personal
well if i could get to him id find a way to kill him
so you you governor would impose the death penalty
no i would commit a crime for which i would happily go to jail
then why not let society do that
because society has to be better than the individual
if i were to do that i would be wrong
and what about guns
isnt it time for a commercial
this is public tv we dont have commercials
were in kentucky just over the ohio river from cincinnati
this is where all the interns stay
in the hotel bar stephen and molly are sitting at a back table theyve both been drinking hard
whered you go after iowa
california for super tuesday
i had to go to new york
you guys needed a lot more help over there
so why politics
because the pay is so good
it just seems like an odd fit
my dad is jack stearns
hes a good guy
hes an asshole but hes your boss
hes not my boss
hes the head of the dnc
you dont work for the democratic national committee
i work for paul paul works for morris and if morris wins hes going to be your dads boss
dont tell my dad that
dont tell your dad a lot of things
what time do you start tomorrow
im showing the new interns how to robo call
im the experienced intern
i do see
how old are you
how old do you think i am
you think im thirty
im sorry how old are you
how old are you
how old do you think i am
too young to fuck a thirty year old
see laws are different in different states
here in your hotel in kentucky
its frowned upon
but well go across the bridge into ohio
where your hotel is
yeah surprisingly theyre very lax about their child endangerment laws
you have a car
i dont drive
i took a cab
i have the keys to the campaign bus
on their smiles the morris campaign bus is parked badly a tire up on the curb in front of the hotel
stephen is on his cell phone he paces back and forth in front of the tv a news show in on
molly is in bed sheets pulled up around her shes just waking up
in fairness this has been tried before
operation chaos as rush limbaugh called it where republicans voted for a democrat they thought they could beat in the general election
we asked senator pullmans campaign manager if this sudden right wing support is welcome
cut to a pre tape with duffy
is it decisive
of course not
look we believe that the polls are within the margin of error and that the senator will win ohio
with ohio democrats
i cant really see republicans showing up to vote for our candidate
having said that well take all the support we can get
on the phone what time does paul land
who do we talk to about polling
i just need to get some internal polling on the fucking independents and the right wing nuts
do you want me to go
he gestures for her to wait
listen put me on the line with
whats the guys name at the wall street journal
you seem busy
i should go
he whispers to her
back to phone
get me on the line with him
she starts to get dressed
molly listen just give me a second
i want to talk to you about something
we can talk about it later if
stephen holds his finger up
just the cleaning lady
keep trying till you get him
were gonna go with the position that weve always said the race is closer than the polling
dont say that
just get him on the line and call me
ill handle it
he hangs up
sorry about that
the cleaning lady
you called me the cleaning lady
youre not mad about that are you
no why would i be mad
molly looks at the tv
stephens eyes go to the tv where chris is still talking
earlier i spoke with jack stearns head of the dnc and he had this to say
i know youre looking for a reaction but listen we have two great candidates in a very tight race
and at the end of the day the voters will decide who best can represent this party in the fall
i understand jack but doesnt this kind of disruption take away from what you want to be pushing this year
back to stephen your dad is an asshole
ill tell him you said that
you said you wanted to talk to me about something
yeah i just wanted
i just wanted to be clear about everything
so theres no confusion
i wont tell anyone about last night
well yeah id appreciate it if we kept this
i mean you know how people are
really wouldnt look good if you screwed an intern
its not like i got drunk and this happened
i wanted to
i really like you
but i just
i dont want there to be any expectations
steven you dont have to say anything
i just dont want you to think im some kind of player
well you are kind of a player but thats okay
no im not
i was being polite
molly starts to tie stephens tie
you were trying to pick me up
no i wasnt
you were pretty obvious about it
i thought i was being all smooth and subtle
you were pretty forward
you were pretty forward
inviting me to the bar
ive been trying to fuck you for a while
pretty slutty of me huh
no not at all
i mean i kind of respect it in a weird sort of way
you have absolutely no idea how to tie a tie do you
no no not a clue
youre very mature
for a teenager
molly kisses him and exits
we intercut with paul driving
stephen walks towards a private jet the governor is at the plane talking to some aides
when are you coming back
ill be at the event
a little late
these cock suckers
fucking dirty shit
what happened with thompson
nothing the prick
we had him all sewed up
how bad is it
im running some numbers now
i dont know
alright ill be there in three hours
i want hard numbers
and a strategy
yeah im on it
i gotta go
he hangs up
the governor and stephen are flying through a bad storm the plane is getting knocked all around
also on board are ben and a secret service agent
stephen is holding onto the armrests white knuckling it the governor watches him
nope just trying to figure out our stops on the ground
i think the weather might determine that
if we get there
both men sit with their heads back on the headrests
well be fine
we have to do it
and its the right thing
nothing bad happens when its the right thing
is this your personal theory
cause i can shoot holes in it
on a humanitarian flight
well there are exceptions to every rule
the governor looks at stephen
so how we doin
no i mean
the campaign how we doin
youre not paul
i pay him to use the word great
i pay you to tell me the truth
i think were solid
governor theres a big difference between paul and me
paul only believes in winning so hell do or say anything to win
but you wouldnt
ill do or say anything if i believe in it
but i have to believe in the cause
youll make a lousy consultant when youre out of this line of work
well i wont be out of this line of work as long as youre in it
so at best youve got eight years
then youll end up with a nice little consultant firm on farragut north
eating at the palm
pulling in seven hundred and fifty grand a year
pimping out senators to saudi princes
they both smile
pimping out ex presidents
then i better win
were in a large hall
governor morris is on stage he stands in front of a huge american flag
morriss wife cindy is standing in the wings along with their seven year old daughter beth
governor morris addresses the crowd
now ive been married for eleven years to the smartest person i know
and we have a normal marriage
which means when we disagree
what we dont ever disagree on is how were going to leave this planet for our daughter
are we gonna leave it better off or worse
the richest people in this country dont pay their fare share
and when theyre asked to they cry socialism they use phrases like redistribution of wealth
that scares everybody and they all run and they hide
for the record my campaign is vehemently against the distribution of wealth to the richest americans by our government
and i will run on that
paul and stephen are back stage behind the huge american flag
we can hear the governors speech in the b
i didnt think it was true
but i should have told you this yesterday
i met with tom duffy yesterday
you were on a plane and he called me and he asked if we could meet
and i said why
he said it was very important so i did
but i shouldve fucking told you
stop stop let me get this straight
you met with tom duffy
whatd he want stephen
the gist of it is he wants to hire me
he wants me to jump ship and come work for him
this is bad paul
he showed me poll numbers with pullman ahead by four
were in really deep fucking trouble he laid out their whole plan
robo calls traffic jams fake lit and fucking thompson
they promised him secretary of state
you know how you fight the war on terror
dont need their product anymore
their product is oil just dont need it and they go away
we dont have to bomb anyone we dont have to invade anyone
if this is some sort of practical i mean my fucking blood pressure is going through the roof right now
paul im sorry
i just didnt think it was true
it doesnt fucking matter what you thought
it matters what you did
it matters what you didnt do
if all this shit is true i made a fucking ass of myself at thompsons place
and i gave away our game plan
please believe me that i honestly believed you were gonna come back and you were gonna tell me that we have thompson in the bag and i didnt see the
but it doesnt make it right and im sorry
let me think
let me think
if im your president the first thing i put in motion ten years from the day im in office
no new car in america runs on an internal combustion engine
itll create hundreds of thousands of new jobs
we will start the next technological revolution and we will lead the world again
like we used to
we get the governor right after he finishes singing kum bay ya and give him everything we know
who do you want
you me and the governor thats it
whats he got after
a fund raiser in cleveland tonight
hell be late
were gonna tell him that if he doesnt offer thompson a cabinet position
hes not gonna get the nomination
will he go for it
i dont fucking know stephen
as paul exits he shoots back
find us a room
molly walks up the steps of the auditorium into the lobby a staffer hands her some papers and she continues
we pull her down a corridor and land at a rehearsal room door
she hands the papers to ben
the governors wife cindy daughter beth and a security man are waiting outside the door
how real are the numbers
we might pick up a couple of points
i dont know we lose by three or four percent
who the fuck knows governor
but we cant take the chance
what do you think
i think we fold up the campaign in ohio
take a loss and blame it on the republicans playing games
head to north carolina
i cant run from ohio
theyll kill us
not if you get thompsons endorsement
im not gonna do it
whats he want head of the fda or something ridiculous
this sits with them
are you fucking kidding me
im gonna give secretary of state to a guy who wants to cut the top ten floors off the un
paul when we started this campaign i said i wasnt gonna make those kind of deals
governor if you lose ohio and they get thompsons delegates
then they get north carolina
then they get the lead
a lead you cant beat
but if we walk from ohio take thompson give him a cabinet post then we take north carolina
and then its simple math mike
take his endorsement and the race is over
paul i respect you
respect your opinion
but im never gonna do it
so i suggest we find a way for me to win ohio
they sit there looking at their shoes
off their looks we were mid action
everyone is there
people running in and out
stephen ben molly
sleeves rolled up
paul is in a closed room but we can see him on the phone
on the phone do we have any other senators that can go to bat for us
house members wont do
whispering to him or a congressman from ohio maybe
but we need a senator
one from ohio would be nice
we push the camera through the room edging closer to paul
this is all the car rental companies in northern ohio
theyve booked every single van for tuesday
jess ill call you back
to molly all of them
on the computer heres what i have so far
independents dont seem to be biting but republicans are
or say they are
theyre not gonna tell a pollster that theyre gonna vote democratic
i dont even know how to read these polls
i called and we can get a hundred vans out of covington and newport kentucky
we dont need the fucking vans
we just dont want pullman to have them
we keep pushing in on paul until we can hear him talking to a reporter on the phone
during this conversation he types on his laptop
no no thats not what im saying
we were the underdog before we got into this and we continue to be the underdog
well the numbers
we knew the numbers would get closer the closer we got to tuesday
im not lowering expectations
have you ever heard me say that we had ohio locked
then at least give me the courtesy of printing that in your column
we see the suv drive down the highway
were in the second row of seats of the governors suv
cindys head on his shoulder
they are very comfortable and easy with each other
the governor is writing a speech on a legal pad
whatre you writing
the greatest speech ever given on hydrogen power
the bar is awfully high on that one
dont i know it
i got hit up by mitchells wife for you to show up at her daughters of the american revolution luncheon
congressman from the first district
you might want to remember that
could you imagine doing this every two years
no i cant
lets just do this one more time
in four more years
you think well lose ohio
i dont know
if you took thompsons delegates the race is over
ohio wouldnt matter
is paul working on you
shaking her head stephen
they are good
is thompson so bad
hes a shit
worse than pullman
every time i draw a line in the sand
and i keep moving it
fund raising union deals
i wasnt going to do any of it
i cant on this one
mitchell ill make her goddamn luncheon
let the old ladies pat me on the head
youve got great hair
you too baby
they lay their heads back onto the headrests
a few hundred students sit around the governor in a theater as he fields questions
morris is cornered by a conservative student
its a silly argument
not to fifty percent of americans
over the age of fifty
thats who votes
thats who shows up at the polls
well thats changing
and hopefully the way we frame the argument is
at this point the camera travels backstage to find stephen ben paul and molly working the phones and laptops
keep an eye on the governor
let me know how its going out there
im on it
ben takes us back out and under this we hear the governor continue debating
a from a religious to a civil rights issue
but one could argue a great difference between gender and race
they used to ban interracial marriage
women couldnt vote
the list goes on
the argument of course we hear boos from students in the audience
at this point the camera finds morris
morris quiets the students
now wait she has a point to make
the argument is that men and women can in fact be separate but equal races cannot
you have separate public bathrooms for men and women but it would be illegal to have separate bathrooms for two races
so thats what im saying
stephen ben and the rest head out of the town hall to get on the bus
what time is this on tonight
howd he do
he did good
the bus rolls down the highway its a flurry of activity
stephen ben molly and our regular staffers
are all on phones blackberrys and laptops
molly looks back over her shoulder to stephen whos face is lit by his laptop
he looks up
they lock eyes
were tight on a tv
its the taped broadcast of the previous town hall meeting
as the scene plays we pull back to see stephen and molly making love
we see pieces of body parts
hair being pulled
its what weve grown used to seeing in a seventies love scene all lit by the flickering of a television
the only score we hear is the sound of the tv
see were framing the argument based on the idea that homosexuality is a choice you choose to be gay not that you were born that way like being born black
because if you start the discussion with the idea that gay is not a life choice but part of your dna then gay marriage is and can only be a
civil rights issue
another student steps up to the microphone
do you think candor is your appeal
is that what youre running on as much as your platform
itll drive them to the polls one way or the other
i just heard a lot of christian coalition cars start up
we pull focus now onto stephen and molly
stephen on top not moving
he looks down to the area where an erection would normally be at this time
then he looks back to molly
its not you
stephen is lying in bed working on some papers
molly is asleep next to him
stephens cell phone rings
almost at the same time we hear another mans voice on the phone
they both stop
no one speaks
stephen is about to speak again when the caller hangs up
stephen looks at the phone
he then looks to the bedside table where he sees an identical phone
hes picked up mollys phone by mistake
he looks at the name of the incoming call
there is none
he looks at the caller id number
he looks at the clock
your phone rang
whos calling at in the morning
i dont know
he asked for you by name
you answered it
i thought it was mine
who was it
i dont know
one of the other interns drunk dialing you
oh that never happens
let me see the number
she reaches for the phone but steven keeps it away from her
still waiting for it stephen
im gonna call him back
he pushes the redial button
and im gonna tell him that im your dad
gimme my phone stephen
and im gonna tell him im coming over there with a shotgun
getting more urgent dont do that stephen
stephen listens to the outgoing message while he looks at molly
her eyes starting to well up
we hear the buzzing of the message through the phone
then we see stephens reaction as it begins to dawn on him who hes listening to
he closes the phone without leaving a message
why is the governor calling you at in the morning
she says nothing
why is the governor calling you at all
im in trouble
with the governor
whats going on
i was working on the campaign in iowa
we had a party in bens room after the rally in des moines
there was a party with you
and the governor
no he wasnt there
where was he
i took him up a hard copy of the polling numbers
after the party
shaking her head yes about midnight i guess
i stood in the doorway with him
we were talking
a long time
then he just reached behind me and closed the door
jesus fucking christ
were you drunk
not that drunk
how many times
just that once
does anybody know
did anyone see you
how could you know
then why is he calling you now
i called him first
because i didnt know who to go to
and i needed nine hundred bucks
i cant go to my dad
so what should i do
a long beat
were close on stephen as he walks down the sidewalk and into
stephen walks into the campaign office
he looks at all the posters with pictures of morris
people greet him as he walks past
the signs all look wrong now
the smile on morriss face looks fake
he sees molly as he passes and heads into the war room
stephen is going through the drawers in his desk
he goes to the office door opens it and yells to ben in the bullpen
come here a minute ben stops what hes doing and heads into stephens office
whats our limit on petty cash
its probably five hundred
i need as much as we have
anything i can help with
dont put it on the books
what should i put it down as
dont put it down as anything
anything over a hundred i got to put it down as something
raising his voice just do it
we follow ben into the bullpen past the staffers who look up at the outburst
molly watches ben and then looks to stephen who closes his door
we stay on molly
we see molly watching through the door
as stephen finishes he opens the door
she gets up and comes into his office
stephen hands molly a folder that he writes on the inside of here
molly opens the folder and reads meet me in the stairwell at noon
she closes the folder
stephen holds out his hand
ill take that
he takes the folder and tears it into several pieces as molly leaves
he throws the pieces into the trash can
stephen stands at a tellers counter he writes out a check for eight hundred dollars to cash
the teller hands him the money
stephen walks down to the sidewalk
hes on the phone with ida
off the record
no i cant tell you what happened in north carolina
thats not what i wanted to ask you about
you met with duffy
who told you that
a little bird
did you meet with him
where are you
i know you met with him at a little bar in cincy two nights ago just before the press conference
duffy ordered buffalo wings
did duffy tell you this
what happened with duffy
youre supposed to be my friend ida
youd stab me in the back like this
youd ruin my reputation just so you wait wait wait is that what you thought
that we were friends
ive given you everything every fucking scoop your profile with pau
youre right youve given me a lot
but lets get real here steve
the only reason you ever treated me well was that i work for the times
not because i was your friend
you give me what i want i write you better stories
dont pretend its any more than that
whyd you meet with duffy
go fuck yourself
stephen starts walking away
okay ill make it easier on you
what happened at paul and thompsons meeting
will you keep your voice down
do you have any idea what a story like this could do to me
of course i do
thats why im giving you a choice here
i could get fired
so its not a difficult choice is it
ive got to file by three p
youve got till then to make up your mind
stephen is left standing there
stephen is on a pay phone in front of the fountain
duffy is at a campaign event he also talks on his cell
you mother fucker
you leaked it
dont bullshit me tom
i have no idea what youre talking about
i just spoke with ida horowicz
shes threatening to release the story
what fucking story
that we met
that i fuckin met with you
how did she find out
dont play dumb here tom
you think i leaked it to her
i didnt leak it to her
well i know i didnt so that leaves you
whats she know
she knows whatever you told her
i swear to jesus i didnt leak it to her steve
i dont want this story out any more than you do
well too late
what did she tell you
she knows where we met she knows when we met
she knows you had buffalo fucking wings
she has a source
yes she has a source
and you have no idea who it could be
well it wasnt me and for the record i didnt have fucking buffalo wings
its gotta be some one else
did you tell anyone
did you admit to meeting with me
then we stonewall her and shes got nothing
shes gonna take the story to drudge or roll call
shit like that
you cant stop her
shes trying to blackmail me wants info about thompson
then tell her what she wants to know
i cant do that
you cant let this story get out
im not gonna be blackmailed tom
you dont have much of a choice here
if i tell her about thompson i gotta tell her hes gonna endorse you guys
then tell her
i can handle it from my side if i start getting calls
no fucking way
paul told her we had thompson in the bag
itll make us look like fools
youre gonna look like fools anyway when he endorses us
i cant do it
youre on a sinking ship steve
tell her what she wants to know and jump
come over to our side
we can control this thing
no answer from stephen
i gotta go
stephen hangs up
molly walks in
its dark in some places
she doesnt see anyone at first
she stands there
then from the shadows we hear stephen
im up here
shit you scared me
she goes up the next flight of stairs and stands next to him on the landing
he hands her an envelope
its almost bucks
you make the appointment now
from a pay phone
ill take you to the clinic and pick you up
no one else
you take the rest of the money and you buy a ticket home
you cant be here anymore
we cant afford it
not with everything thats gonna happen in the next week
this situation just cant be here
you mean i cant be here
but i would never tell anyone
i would hope not
you fucked up molly
he and i both fucked up
but i have a responsibility to him
and more importantly i have a responsibility to this campaign
i could go to north carolina and work on the campaign
molly youve go to wake the fuck up
this is the big leagues
and when you make mistakes you lose your right to play
make the appointment and tell me when and where we have to go
stephen sits at the desk in front of his laptop
ben sits on the floor surrounded by papers and a laptop
as ben is talking stephen is staring blankly at the screen
listen to this
i got the placement in the times
this is a match up of hope versus fear
nine times out of ten the fear candidate tends to be the most experienced
but in our presidential races the least experienced candidate almost always wins
jfk versus nixon
carter versus ford
bush versus gore
i like our chances with the new kid on the block end quote
thomas fucking duffy
hes gotta be having a stroke right now
stephens phone buzzes he picks it up and reads the text
it reads noon tomorrow molly
he sets the phone down
ben continues talking
stephen sits in his car in the back of the parking lot waiting
his phone rings
he looks at the caller id
he sets the phone back down waits and sees molly come out of the hotel
she looks around and heads toward stephen
she gets into the car and they drive off in silence
stephen and molly drive in silence
stephen and molly driving down the street
stephen drives until he sees the clinic
stephen stands at the receptionists window and hands the nurse a clipboard with the forms molly has filled out
she hands him back the yellow copies and he sits down next to so just call me when you can leave okay
looking at the clinic i hate this shit
ill be back thisll all be over
were in pauls room
hes lying on the bed talking on his cell phone
ben sits at the desk working on a laptop
absolutely theres no question about it
paul goes to the door opens it and waves stephen in shutting the door behind him as he enters
but weve got to think broader strokes here rethink everything
yeah i know how to handle it
look stevie just got here
can i call you back in a few minutes
he hangs up the governor
we had a good long talk on the way back
hes up to speed with everything
howd he take it
better than i thought he would
still wont take thompsons endorsement
paul i gotta tell you something
ida knows i met with duffy
paul stares at him blankly
i dont know how she found out
tried to blackmail me
said she was gonna let the story out if i didnt tell her what happened at your meeting with thompson
so its gonna hit the papers
whoever she takes it to theyre gonna call me for a statement
i could just deny the whole thing but if they call duffy and he admits to it that could look worse
if i say no comment they wont let up
i leaked it to ida
ben looks up from his laptop
at the event
i dont understand
we made a deal
theyre gonna print that story in the paper tomorrow morning
why would you do that to me
why would you do that to the campaign
the campaign will survive
then why would you do that to me
makes it easier to let you go
whyd you meet with duffy
i made a mistake a stupid mistake
you didnt make a mistake
you made a choice
you called me and left a message to call back
that it was important
but when i did
you said to forget about it
you chose not to tell me
why did you make that choice
i didnt think it was important
sure you did
but you went because you were curious because you were flattered
because it made you feel special to think duffy wanted to speak to you instead of me
because you thought to yourself maybe i can get something out of this
because it made you feel big
first campaign i ran tiny little race in kentucky state senate seat
workin for redneck nobody named mcguthrie
had no money no staff no fuckin office
everyone thought we didnt stand a chance
theres no way we can compete
and about this time a guy running a congressional campaign a few districts over gives me a call
says i really like what you were able to do for poor ole sam
but lets face it hes a goner so why dont you come work for me
what do i do
well stephen this is where you and i are different
i told sam about the call
and sam says to me paul you think this others guys got a shot at winning and he can pay you more than anything i can afford so if its
what you feel you need to do then i wont get in your way
so i say sam you took a chance and hired me when i was even more of nobody than you are and id be damned if im gonna jump ship
just because the shit hit the fan
we lost the race but three years later when sam decided to run for governor who do you think he called
we won that race
and twenty years later im where i am now
beat theres only one thing i value in this world steve and thats loyalty
without it youre nothing and you have no one
and in politics its the only currency that you can count on
thats why im letting you go
not because youre not good enough
but i value trust over skill
and i dont trust you anymore
well it really isnt whether you trust me its whether the governor does
the governor knows he thinks its the right thing to do
if i were you
id get a good night sleep because youre gonna get fucking pounded by calls from the press in the morning
off of stephen we molly is sitting in the clinic waiting room post op
the nurse comes out with a bag of prescription drugs and some instructions
these are vicodin
theyre for the pain
you have ambien
thatll help you sleep
and i threw in a couple of xanax for the next couple of days
did the doctor explain there would be some bleeding
and it shouldnt last very long
if it does youll need to call us
molly just sits there staring
do you have a ride
molly shakes her head yes
if you need anything you just call the clinic
the nurse walks back into the office
molly just sits there
we stay with her for a while
stephen is driving
molly walks outside the clinic and down the street
through the front window we see molly sitting in a booth making a phone call
there is a tv on the wall the news plays
yes mike senator franklin thompson of north carolina arrived at the lunken airfield today igniting rumors of a deal in the works
the ny times is reporting that senator thompson will pledge his three hundred and fifty six delegates to senator pullman
stephen drives by the clinic he slows to see if molly is still there
the clinic is closed
molly gets out of a cab and walks into the hotel
under this we hear hey where were you today
im not feeling great ben
were in front of mollys door as the scene continues
you picked a hell of day to call in sick
fucking wild day
stephens off the campaign
paul fired him
some fucking set up about loyalty and it looks like stephen was doubling down with duffy on the pullman campaign
i was sitting in the room when paul told stephen that he was fired
stephen said whos gonna take over and paul said me
and im like
easy there soldier
but stephen goes ape shit then paul gives the speech about loyalty and then shits on stephen like ive before
when was this
molly listen to me
im gonna run the campaign under paul
stephen is going to duffy
i just jumped three years ahead
so starting tomorrow morning we go into full damage control and im telling you stephens going ape shit
he said hes taking everyone down on his way out
shit i gotta take this
do you need anything
stephen enters the offices staffers look up and recognize him
you got an appointment
stephen keeps walking
stephen arrives at a medium sized glass partitioned office
as he looks in we see duffy and five or six staffers around a table
duffy is holding court the mood is light
duffy notices stephen standing there
duffy walks stephen a few doors down to a conference room
a single staffer is working on a laptop
joe can you excuse us for a minute
the staffer leaves and duffy closes the door
not very bright walking in here
im coming to work for you
a reporter at roll call phoned me this afternoon
i know who leaked it
you told paul
i told him we met
he leaked it
you shouldnt have told him that
i felt like i should
ive worked with paul
he gets paranoid
so he fired you
youre lying to me
and i can give you everything on morris
i can lay out his whole strategy for you
i already know his strategy
paul gave it all to thompson
what if i had something else
youd do that to morris
revenge makes people unpredictable steve
i cant have someone whos unpredictable
im not unstable
if it had been a clean break if youd left morris before this story broke thatd be one thing
that we could control
but the way itd look now paul fires you and then you come work for us
looks like were picking up the scraps
puts morris in the drivers seat
i cant have that
we see a shot close on stephens clinched fist holding the yellow copies from mollys clinic visit down by his side
we pan up to his face
what if i had something big
something thatll bring morris down
what is it
shaking his head give me the job
its not gonna happen
go take a nice long vacation
youre a smart guy steve
everything i said yesterday is true
but maybe politics isnt for you
politics is my life
do yourself a favor
get out now while you still can
go into entertainment or business or open a fucking restaurant in costa rica anything
do what will make you happy
you stay in this business long enough it makes you jaded and cynical
just like me
you knew i was gonna tell paul
i didnt know
i thought you might but i didnt know
you knew if i told him hed fire me
thing you gotta know about paul hes big on loyalty
yeah i got a nice speech on that
you were never gonna hire me
put yourself in my shoes steve
your opponent has the best media mind in the country working on his team
what do you try to do
you either try to hire him yourself or work it so if you cant have him the other team cant either
this was a win win situation for me
you work for us great
paul doesnt have you
then again if paul fires you and i dont take you fine paul still doesnt have you
either way i win
the moment i got you to sit down in that chair i knew id won
this is my life youre talking about
its not easy for me to do this sort of thing steve
dont think i take any pleasure in it
im sorry for you
i really am
take care of yourself
stephen pulls into the parking lot
stephen climbs the back stairwell to avoid seeing any of his former co workers
he gets to the fifth floor and walks down the hall towards mollys room
as he turns the corner he sees a maids cart in front of her room
the door is halfway open
as he starts walking towards her door we see the hotel manager come running out of mollys room he heads the opposite way towards the elevators
hes fumbling with his walkie talkie
stephen gets to her room and we see a janitor kneeling over mollys lifeless body
stephen steps into the room
he can barely move
he just stands there looking at the situation
the janitor is on the phone
no maam shes not breathing
stephen is looking at molly
he looks around the room
he sees her prescription bottle empty on the bed next to her
he sees her clothes all around the room
i dont know fifteen minutes
how far away are they
the janitor now turns and looks at stephen do you know her
stephen nods his head yes
we hear the sound of a distant ambulance
janitor goes back to the phone
im sorry what
yes i can hear them now
stephen looks down on the bed and sees mollys phone
he reaches down takes it and slides it in his pocket
close on stephens face as he stares down at molly
we hear the ambulance approaching the building stephen comes running out the door
an ambulance has pulled up and emts are on their way in
police are also pulling up
stephen keeps walking he gets in his car and sits there
stephen pulls out his phone and listens to his messages
you have four new messages and four saved messages
first new message
where are you
crying its four something
theyre gonna close in a few minutes
stephen its ben
what the fuck
did paul lose his mind
whatre you gonna do
stephen i just heard from ben
please dont do anything fucked up
shes losing it
godamnit you motherfucker pick up the phone
dont do it you fuck
we now hear molly in a very different tone calmer maybe even drunk
im not going away
stephen hangs up
we stay on him for a while
the governor paul ben and the other staffers sit in front of a monitor watching a news piece
we now cut to cnn footage in front of a hospital as we hear the report continue
the coroner has stated that based on the evidence found by the police in the hotel room that this was an accidental overdose a lethal cocktail of alcohol and prescription
the cincinnati police chief darryl mathews has called for a full investigation pending a toxicology report which could take up to two weeks
just a terrible terrible situation for the former senator now dnc chairman jack stearns and his family
off the governors face we stephen and senator thompson are seated on a bench
i want on the ticket
you need me on the ticket
and you need my delegates
you could use em before tuesday
make a fine story on the sunday morning news cycle
so i expect to hear from you by noon tomorrow
or i endorse pullman and take my cabinet seat
they look at each other
anything else you want to talk about
were at a press conference the governor paul ben and the rest of the staff are standing behind the microphone
the governor is making a statement the entire staff is in a state of shock
we have sent our condolences to jack and joanna stearns and their whole family
and of course our hearts go out to them
its hard to imagine what theyre going through
all we know at this point is it appears to be a drug
an accidental prescription overdose
is suicide ruled out
we have no reason to believe
he looks to paul
i dont think we have any of that information yet
obviously there will be a full investigation
just wanted to say that our hearts go out
our prayers go out to the entire family
and she was part of our family
did you know her well governor
but i did know her and what i saw was a hard working young woman with a great and positive spirit
its a very sad day in our campaign and a very sad day for the people close to jack
how long has she interned with you governor
the governor looks back at paul
paul steps up to the mic
shed only been on the road with us for a few weeks
maybe four i think i can check
will you continue with your schedule today
youre set to tour proctor gamble this afternoon
we will most certainly stay on schedule
this accident and we have to assume for now its an accident is just simply a tragedy
the work the schedule wont be altered
it just means that those of us that knew molly will go about our jobs with a heavy heart
as these questions continue the governors cell phone vibrates
he pulls it from his pocket and reads the name of the caller
it reads molly
he looks up
panic starts to set in the only sounds we hear are his heart beating and the phone vibrating
the governor looks at each of his staff members
then he scans around the room looking through the press corps up to the back doorway where he locks eyes with stephen
stephen holds a cell phone to his ear
they stare at each other
then stephen hangs up and the governors phone stops vibrating
stephen turns and leaves
stephen approaches the restaurant the lights are off
he peers through a window we hear the door unlock
one of the governors secret service men opens the door
he motions stephen in
stephen follows the secret service guy through the dark restaurant they pass several other secret service guys sitting in booths
they cross towards the back to the kitchen door stephen enters
the kitchen is small and dimly lit
the governor is standing behind the center island hanging pans hide his face
it seems you have something you want to talk about
does it seem that way
if you have something
or think you have something you want to get off your chest
whats say i do the talking and you do the listening
as of tomorrow morning theres going to be some changes in your campaign
paul is out
i will be your senior campaign manager
ill draft a statement were at a point in the campaign where some changes have to be made etc
you can put your own words in there you do it better than most
and why would i do that
because you want to win
because you broke the only rule in politics
you want to be president you can start a war you can lie you can cheat you can bankrupt the country but you cant fuck the interns
theyll get you for that
what do you think you have stephen
a troubled young girl tells you a story
a troubled young pregnant girl
is that what she told you
who needed cash for an abortion
what did you do give her money
maybe she just wanted cash and you were the perfect guy to hit up
is that your best play
you need a job that bad stephen
you walk in here with your dick in your hand
youve got nothing
so how did i get here
youre right mike theres nothing
no phone messages no text no e mails no photos or tapes and yet im standing right here
well go home
she left a note
the governor stands in silence
how would you know that
i cleaned up your mess
i took her phone and i found her note
they stare at each other in silence
i thought it was an accident
you tell me you were the last one she called
note says she was pregnant said you were going to pay for her abortion
it also said she didnt want to hurt you
then why would she leave a note that could only do that
because shes twenty
what do you want
pauls gone today
i set a meeting with you and thompson where you promise him the ticket
you get three hundred and fifty six pledged delegates you get north carolina and then you take office and make right what so many have made wrong
all the things we both believe in
well i dont believe in extortion
i dont believe in tying myself to you for the next eight years
four years lets not get ahead of ourselves
a long beat
finally the governor says what were you doing in her room
housekeeping before you ended up on page one
you were already fired you were out
what were you doing in her room
i was fixing a situation
i got a call someone from the hotel thought i could help and called me
you were off the campaign but you thought it was important to come back and fix things
it was your voice on the phone the other night
you were fucking her
what did you do stephen
i loaned her some money and gave her a ride
i bet you did
theres no note
okay theres no note
show it to me
you think i brought it here
thats how people get hurt
okay lets play this out
youre not wearing a wire because everything youve suggested is illegal
and you wouldnt fare well in federal prison
you were fucking her and she told you about her situation
there are no records or conversations between us
and since shes had an abortion no dna evidence
so if theres no note then its your word against mine
a fired disgruntled employee or a sitting governor
theres no note
its your call governor
as the governor weighs his options we
paul is sitting in a barber shop getting his hair cut
the barber cuts
paul sits there
the tv is on
a sports show
no one talks
we watch pauls face as the barber clips the back of his head
paul walks out starts down the street
as he passes the first corner he sees the governors suv and the secret service suv both parked on the side of the road
paul looks at the suv
then walks up to the window
the window rolls down and the governor leans his head out
paul you got a minute
we stay outside the car for along time
we hear chris mathews under this shot
we see paul get out of the suv and the two suvs drive off leaving him standing there
stephens in a different hotel now
the tv is on
how much could a big shake up days before the ohio primary hurt a campaign
i asked paul zara how his firing could actually help the candidate
we see stephen shaving in the bathroom mirror as he listens to the tv
the governor and i both felt that in light of some of these changing numbers it was best to put a new face on the campaign
stephen is very talented
we see a shot of an old church
people are walking up the steps and through the big open doors
were at a memorial service for molly
we see a lot of young people
paul is sitting in the back row
as mollys father jack stearns speaks stephen walks in
he sits in the adjacent row he and paul look at each other
you always hear people talking about events out of sequence
the order of things
there is no greater grief than a parent laying their child to rest
she was a little girl trying to make it in a very grown up world
a world were every mistake is magnified and she was smart and pretty and so so young
he looks to the priest next to him
father you ask us to accept gods plan to not question his judgment with all due respect i dont accept this judgment
she made the world better not just for me but for everyone she touched
were on the street in front of the church
people are filing out
paul is waiting next to stephens car as steven walks up
you should hire jack for a speech writer
ill keep that in mind
are you here to talk to me
im friends with the family
i got her the internship
known her since she was born
the governor couldnt make the flight
hes meeting with thompson
look at you all grown up with tits and all
i learned from the best
one day well grab a beer and youll tell me what you had on the governor that put me out
how do you know i didnt have something on you
they both smile
you better get going youve got a campaign to run and ive got offices to go look at
paul nods his head
nice consultant firm right off of k street
paul turns to leave
a million a year and nobody to fuck you over
paul without looking back
governor morris with his wife and daughter stand at the podium just behind senator thompson
there are a few hundred people in attendance campaign workers supporters and press
and the right man to lead this great nation of ours in these challenging times and the next president of the united states of america governor mike morris
and i ask only one thing that all of us stand shoulder to shoulder and arm in arm in a united democratic party
and i strongly urge that the three hundred and fifty six loyal delegates that i have carried as a badge of honor throw their support to the governor
lets end this primary and get on to the business of pennsylvania ave
more big cheers
and god bless the united states of america
thompson turns and shakes the hand of governor morris
morris steps up to the microphone
under the following we hear the governors speech
we see satellite trucks press vehicles police cars etc
at a catering truck we see a pair of hands grab some coffee and cookies
this is another young intern jill
we follow her across the street and into a door
jill comes through the door
we follow her through the hallways crowded with television cables and technicians
she makes her way in to a large reception room where stephen is watching governor morris give his speech
she hands him a coffee
we cut between the governor and stephen watching from the back
thank you senator thompson
well the polls arent quite closed but i want to congratulate senator pullman
and his republican constituents on their win here in ohio
the room explodes in laughter and applause
senator thompson i am honored to stand here today with you
i am humbled by your kind words thank you
ladies and gentlemen today marks the beginning of a fight between two sets of ideals
either were going to move forward or were going to live in the past
either were going to lead the world in technology or we are going to bury our heads in the sand
the sands of saudi arabia
the sands of iraq
either were going to let greed and corruption ruin our industries and our shorelines or we are going to take back our country
we are not a nation used to coming in second or third
while the governors speech continues we stay close on stephen as he walks through the crowd
we follow him into governor morriss staging area
four monitors on a table show different network feeds
we watch stephen roll down his sleeves and button his shirt
he ties his tie and puts his jacket on
from the monitors we hear reporters etc
we push in on one of the monitors where duffy is being interviewed
as we push in we see stephen cross out of the room
ben is watching he looks back and smiles at stephen
no its not decisive we still have several contests and those states are going to want to have their say
it does look like well win ohio
but you must concede that these three hundred and fifty six delegates put the pledged delegates out of reach
and with word today that the super delegates are breaking three to one for morris
we still have a lot of contests rachel ohio is well then do you have the funds
as we read it of course we have the funds
were getting new donations daily
our new intern jill crosses into frame looking down at ben
i was told to talk to you
im supposed to get a phone
are you a bearcat
im from columbus im a buckeye
a shot of stephen walking across the quad towards the gym
we pick up stephen walking with ida
youre making me look bad
i just filed a story that said you were off the campaign and thompson was going to pullman
you cant believe everything you read
i want to give you an opportunity to comment on my next story
it says that you delivered thompson
you got the three hundred and fifty six delegates you delivered the nomination
and all you asked in return was pauls job
any chance of you confirming that
they approach a security guard standing by a set of double doors
no press beyond this point
ill read about it in the funny papers
come on stephen
arent we friends anymore
youre my best friend ida
and stephen walks through the doors
a wide shot of the darkened gymnasium
stephen sits on a stool in front of a camera lit by a single television light
were now in tight one person is putting a mic on stephen while the other is applying make up
no one speaks
the sound man then puts and earwig into stephens ear
you should be able to hear them
do you hear them
we hear the buzzing in his ear of the broadcast from new york
yeah i can hear them
good quick mic check can you count to ten for me
stephen counts to ten
everyone stands behind the camera
the sound man with his headset on whispers
theyre coming to you in about forty five seconds
we sit in silence staring at stephens face
ten seconds nothing
twenty seconds nothing this scene starts to resemble our opening a dark auditorium only a few people doing their individual jobs
stephen looks at two interns holding clipboards and cell phones
the first ad is sitting on the floor talking on his headset
the cameraman makes adjustments
a man sweeping the gym floor in the distance
they all seem to be staring at him
they probably arent but he feels it
the enthusiasm and excitement of stephen has given over to emptiness
the price of winning at all cost
we stay on stephens face
we now hear the governors speech through stephens earwig
senator thompson i am proud that you have brought integrity back to this election
because thats what this comes down to integrity
who we are
because how we project ourselves to the rest of the world matters
our future depends on it
forty seconds the silence is broken by the sound man
coming to you in five
through the earwig we hear an john king
we now have governor morriss new senior campaign advisor stephen myers coming to us from xavier university where senator thompson has just endorsed governor morris essentially ending this primary race
to stephen stephen can you give us some insight into how this whole thing unfolded
