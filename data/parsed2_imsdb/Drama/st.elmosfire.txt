written by joel schumacher carl kurlander september red titles on black
the sound of a young max and woman on a wild car ride
at the end of the titles the sound of a sudden car crash a white incandescent flash of light fills the screen
through the brilliant white light we electric doors zip open
alec newberry a handsome possessor of the right stuff his beautiful roommate leslie hunter kevin dolenz self styled chain smoking sardonic and kirbo kreager short hyper dressed like a waiter
dash worriedly into the busy emergency room
they are all twenty two or barely twenty two
only four months out of college they are in their freshman year of life
alec leslie kevin and kirbo dash past a cubicle where a totally naked three hundred pound man paces in a daze
past this they find a black nurse talking with two cops
wendy beamish and billy hicks
they were in a car accident
zip open again introducing julianna van patter jules another freshman in life but her sleek style gives her a certain sexual sophistication
she is accompanied by her dark interesting date as she joins her friends and the cops
theyre dead arent they
everyone ignores her as alec hands his card to the cops
officers im alec newberry with congressman langstons office
leslie whispers to jules while alec and the cops talk
i think theyre okay
are you aware theres a three hundred pound man walking around naked
wendy beamish a sweet faced insecure preppy emerges from a first aid room with a bandaged forehead
oh my god
are you all right
its the car my father gave me for graduation thats totalled
see if you can sober him up
kevin always does what alec tells him to
meanwhile wendy pulls out her visa card and speaks to the nurse
how much do i owe you
he almost killed you
destroyed your car and youre paying
as leslie comforts her wendy is looking over jules date who hovers in the distance
is that your date
the naked man wanders past them
no thats my date
as usual jules has managed to make wendy laugh just as the cops approach her
you pressing charges
hicks legal counsel and hes not required to take any tests
youre a little late counselor
hes in the van giving blood right now
the cops start toward the electric doors as kirbo and alec follow
leslie helps wendy with the bill
camera finds jules whispering dramatically to her date
ill have to be with her all night
they dont know if shes going to make it
she looks fine
she could black out at any second
ill call you
jules joins leslie and wendy
and dont you both start on your father complex theory
alec and kirbo follow the cops toward a mobile van
were dealing with a first offender here and since ms
beamish doesnt want to press charges whaddya say we just let this one slide officers
they reach the back of the mobile van where we see billy hicks a handsome daredevil playing his saxophone wearing handcuffs for two good looking nurses and kevin who is
trying to give him black coffee
okay youre under arrest
alec looks to kevin for information about billys condition
i wouldnt strike a match near his blood
hey watch my sax
you girls believe in premarital sax
they laugh as alec barks at him
billy four months after graduation and youre still acting like every nights a fraternity party
arent you even concerned about wendy
jesus how bad is it
she might have finally exceeded the limit on her fathers visa
billy smiles with relief as the cops lead him toward their car
will you both get serious
hes being arrested for drunk driving
but i dont know if you could call that driving
wendy leslie and jules come from the hospital just in time to see billy being put into the cop car
wendy rushes to billy and they embrace
well be right behind you
they all move toward alecs car except kirbo who sud denly noticessomeone
he becomes mesmerized as he falls away from the group and starts back for the hospital
elmos fire rev
he enters and begins to pick up speed as he quickly catches up to a beautiful intern in a white lab coat
she hesitates somewhat puzzled
you dont remember me
i do but im trying
you were a senior when i started georgetown
its been four years
how are you
i always knew you would
and im a lawyer
as she looks at his waiters duds i mean im a waiter studying to be a lawyer
and you became a doctor
just like you said you would
im finishing my clinical
i cant believe it
do you still like woody allen movies
there is a big commotion at the other and of the hail
ive got to go
nice seeing you
she races down the hall joining paramedics wheeling in a large black man on a gurney
his hysterical wife runs screaming behind them
elmos fire rev
dale helps them maneuver the gurney down the hall leaving a small black child alone and frightened in their wake
dale comes running back and picks up the child
kirbo watches as the rest of the hospital moves in real time but dale comforting the frightened child moves in madly in love
camera pans the preppy nightlife and drinking spots
camera finds a group of
postgrads moving into a build ing
one of the postgrads drops his half of a bureau and runs into the street toward alecs old oldsmobile
hey billy wheres the fifty you owe me
alec drives while leslie tends to wendy between them
billy kirbo and kevin are in the back seat with jules on their lap
alec could you kinds burn a little rubber
alec turns the corner as billy continues
thanks for bailing me out
a local hangout for those primarily in their twenties
alec parks as his gang emerges
elmos fire rev
s when are you going to get a new car
one that truly expresses your lifestyle as the perfect couple
not everybody got recruited out of school into international banking moneybags
my mom and dad gave us this car
i think i was conceived in the back seat
its still sticky
wait til my father hears the car is totalled
im gonna get you a new car wendy
everyone screams in disbelief as they go into st
alec leslie jules wendy kevin holds the door open but no one thanks him
a young burned out undergrad clayton follows
youre not welcome clayton
thank you very much
hows life after school
like getting slam dunked against a brick wall thank you very much
college is the last womb
got a cigarette for a lowly undergrad
if you tell me the meaning of life
elmos fire rev
lifes like acne
it has to get worse before it gets better
young professionals graduate students and precocious undergrads populate the p
clarke like bar restaurant
kirbo quickly goes back to work waiting tables
alec gets rid of a group of rowdy undergrads sitting at two tables pushed together
he admonishes wally the burly owner
you let undergrad punks at our tables
theyve only been there ten minutes
yeah well weve been here for four years
alec leslie jules wendy kevin and billy still with sax around his neck take their usual chairs as kirbo drops off a large pitcher of beer
hey i need a real drink
kirbo is long gone
waiters are like cops
never around when you need one
kevin and alec begin bouncing quarters from the edge of a table into their beers obviously some ritual
will somebody get me a screwdriver
and a hammer
you know what it means to have a suspended license for drunk driving on your record
elmos fire rev
it means i wont ever be able to be a cop in d
hey wend youre not angry are you
no im not angry
never trust a woman who says she isnt angry
you better call your wife billy
billy reluctantly leaves as jules laces into kevin
youre the one whos so angry these days
i thought writing for the washington post would make you happy
writing obituaries is not writing jules
all my characters die in the and
id like to write something about the meaning of life for a change
youll get your chance kevin
alec suddenly spots tommy bancroft an older version of alec across the room
tommy bancroft senator hodges key guy
come on i want you to meet him
they leave the table as jules turns to kevin
the meaning of life kevin is fun good times and a little h u m o r
dont you enjoy anything anymore
i enjoy being afraid of russia
its a harmless fear
makes america feel better and russia gets an inflated sense of national worth from our paranoia
excuse me i have to call in my latest epitaphs to the death squad
the presses are waiting
he gets up and leaves the table passing kirbo
did you see her at the hospital
well honey i kinda had a car accident
i know i dont have any insurance
arent you even gonna ask if im okay
billy adjusts a framed photo on the wall of him alec jules wendy kevin leslie and kirbo in their graduation caps and gowns
he notices a womans reflection in the glass
he turns to see she is flirting with him from the bar
he smiles back
kevin arrives and billy sees a perfect way to get off the phone
heres kevin he wants to say hello
he hands the phone to a more than reluctant kevin and moves toward the young woman at the bar
a double screwdriver
he joins the young woman who is eyeing his sax
so you believe in premarital sax
leslie watches as jules applies eyeshadow to wendys bruised eye
will you both give billy a break
he lost his job today
the job alec got for him
you didnt give him any money did you
i thought you were going to take definite steps to change everything in your life that is not working
that doesnt leave much left
i better break this to alec gently before he finds out the wrong way and destroys his political career by murdering billy in front of fifty witnesses
she leaves as jules looks to wendy
wendy this is all too destructive
life in the fat lane
youre not fat
my thighs are fat
and no diet works
the only way to lose weight on your thighs is amputation
you have to amputate billy the kid
i know but i cant
i dont get it
billy gets cozier with the young woman
so what line of work are you in
im a very important drinker
so how bout we cut outta here
elmos fire rev
a young woman i came with my girl friend
thats okay honey
this face seats five
billy may i see you please
billy follows as leslie alerts kevin and kirbo
alec and billy enter
whats up al
may i see you over here please
billy joins him
alec grabs him and shoves his head in the toilet
why didnt you tell me you blew another job
for some insane reason i thought youd take it badly
kevin and kirbo rush in
dont drown him hes a father
alec releases billy who comes up with his hair wet and gives alec a major shove
thats right you are a father and when are you gonna grow up
like this was real mature al
they all start to laugh
elmos fire rev
i just got pissed off cause i had to pull so many strings to get you that job
working for senator pomerantz was not for me
billy looks at himself in the mirror
thats all right
you couldnt help yourself
youre an asshole
besides the wet look is in
he shakes his head showering them with toilet water
why do they put ice cubes in the urinals
it tastes better
leslie jules and wendy wait anxiously but the guys emerge pals forever again
together as a group they join tommy bancroft and his pals at the jukebox singing leslie works at a large drafting table in their sparsely furnished loft
she wears over sized pajamas
if we could find the money it would be better to get the longer sofa
alec enters in his underwear brushing his teeth
tommy bancroft said i could start working on weekends for hodges
no pay at first but a way toward big dough
they wrap themselves around each other kissing
isnt hodges a republican
elmos fire rev
hes a senator and republican senators aides get paid a lot more than democratic congressmens assistants
what happened to that newberry political conviction i fell in love with
you want the longer sofa
i want you
im going to buy you a red nightgown with satin and lace
and rubber and leather
he opens her shirt and smothers her with love
your breath is so sweet
wait let me get the babykiller
she starts for the bathroom
lets just do it
were getting married soon
not so soon
lets take a chance
and guess who has to carry the bullet around for nine months
there is a knock at the front door
elmos fire rev
who could that be
who else could it be
jules of course afraid to stay in her new apartment alone and shes spending the night again
jules sits drinking vodka as leslie listens
so this crummy welfare hospital called and remember i told you about my fathers second wife
the one who used to lock you in the closet all the time
she gambled away all the money she got out of my father is on her i deathbed and she put me down as next of kin
but what about your father
unreachable somewhere in south africa with his new wife who it turns out is only three years older than me
and if i dont reach him guess whos going to end up paying for that old witchs funeral
is there some insane irony to this or what
im sure your father will take care of everything
sure just like he takes care of everything else including not showing up for my graduation
in the background alec has brought in their mattress and some sheets and a pillow
youre still my indiana jones
always coming to my rescue
i just know better than to try and break the umbilical cord between two old roommates
good night jules
leslie kisses jules and goes into the bedroom with alec
jules takes another belt of vodka
dirty laundry and woody allen posters
kevin sits in the middle of the mess looking at photographs longingly
he wears camouflage shirts a black beret and shades drinks brandy and writhes in orgiastic ecstasy as he sings along with janis joplin
kirbo enters carrying his bike and kevin immediately hides the photographs in a straw basket and becomes his sophisticated self
quick whats the meaning of life
kevin looks puzzled as kirbo hangs up his bike
the girl i fell in love with when we were freshmen
remember i met her at that big fountain on main campus
the one that says knowledge art religion life
she was sitting on the life side and she smiled at me
you took her to one movie
thats not love its infatuation
kirbo searches madly through records strewn on the floor
a ki rbo kevin there are several quintessential moments in a mans life
losing his virginity
he yanks janis joplin off abruptly
becoming a father
killing his roommate for removing janis joplin for the soundtrack from manhattan
and having the right girl smile at you
she has the whitest teeth ive ever seen
rhapsody in blue fills the room
kevin begins gathering up his endless pieces of paper notes etc
if you think im going to live through another year of finding poorly written unmailed love scratchings around this apartment
i found her again
its true love
i have her hospital schedule
love is just an illusion created by lawyer types like yourself to perpetuate another illusion called marriage to create the reality of divorce and the illusory need for divorce lawyers
did you know there are more people in law school right now than there are lawyers on the planet
youre just bitter cause you havent had sex for a long time
the sexual revolution
elmos fire rev
it used to be that sex was the only free thing in the world
loves an illusion
finally having gathered up all his notes kevin moves toward the bedroom
its the only illusion that counts
anyone whos ever been in love
he moves into the bedroom closing the door on kirbo
a great fall day
young people shop and party on the busy street
camera finds jules wendy and leslie exit ing a store with their purchases
jules is on wendys case
you should have bought the red dress
red drives men mad
as two college guys hit on jules she flips her red cape
i have a mad man in my life already
you have to put some kind of distance between you and billy
jules is right
kevin and kirbo join them
elmos fire rev
its easy for both of you
men are just a game for you jules
and of course you and alec are
the perfect couple
they approach jules jeep
thanks for the pressure guys
shouldnt we be finding you an apartment
a the group picks up alec and billy who have just come from a small office building
billy has made a great effort to look establishment
alec as always looks like a ralph lauren ad
they cram into the crowded jeep
howd you do
im an official pollster thanks to alec
i had to promise our first born
keep your nose clean and you could move up fast billy
billy is quickly pulling off his tie unbuttoning his shirt and messing up his hair
youre a god alec
how bout bloody marys on me at st
everyone cheers except alec
i gotta get back to work
since when do you work on saturdays
since he started volunteer moonlighting for senator hodges
what is the three year president of georgetowns young democrats doing working for a republican
moving up kirbo
as most of the others boo and hiss playfully camera finds billy talking to wendy
reaching in his pocket he gives her a toy car
mb teti ya rev
i told you id get you a new car

hey come on its saturday night

the jeep parked jules lets kevin in
jules and kevin can be heard climbing the stairs outside
you havent been here since you helped me move in
oh did you move in too
remember pair of shoes
she opens the elaborate locks and they enter
what do you think
very subtle and very pink
must have cost some subtle bucks
why do you think god invented credit for fabulous people like me
fix us a drink
she disappears into the bedroom
i knew youd like it
you have such sensitivity
fix me a vodka rocks
elmos fire rev
v theres no one home
sadly she walks back to her apart ment
its getting darker outside
kirbo wearing a jacket anxiously waits behind a tree watching a car pull into the parking lot
dale biberman emerges
kirbo keeps out of sight and frantically dashes toward a side entrance to the building
kirbo dashes down the hall
approaching a corner he immediately achieves nonchalance as he accidentally runs into dale at the entrance
how nice to see you again
kirby what brings you back here
nothing serious i hope
just tying up some legal loose ends for my friends
ah funny running into you again
i noticed theres going to be a woody allen festival and i thought maybe we
i dont get to the movies much anymore
ive got to go
she is moving away
how about lunch
that would be nice sometime
she is moving quicker
elmos fire rev
how about wednesday
dale is gone
leslie is trying to coordinate dinnerwhile kevin is looking at a rendering of a complex housing unit
a whole community within itself
right near lockheed
open some wine
looks like it could be put together with leggo blocks
you design this
i did all the mechanicals for one of our senior architects and i think hes going to promote me to the design staff
kevin is fighting with a ridiculous wine opener
maybe you could design a corkscrew that actually works
everything in this apartment comes from scandinavia
they dont even have wine in scandinavia
naturally leslie opens it in a flash
do you think my attachment to alec is unnatural
no i think mine is
weve only just started to live together and hes already pushing for the wedding
well since you fell in love with a democrat and now hes a republican i think all bets are off
elmos fire rev
a leslie burns herself and shouts
how do some women do this every night of their lives and not go insane
they are insane
wives husbands children love marriage relationship
its all insane
thats what im afraid of
did i tell you that my perfect sister and her perfect husband are getting a perfect divorce
i have the perfect cure
stay away from love
he finds the butter and puts some on her hand
you must have been in love once
you like hot peppers
doesnt alec hate them
now come on kevin you must have been in love with somebody sometime
once in junior high
i played guitar in a group and fellin love with our singer who did weve only just begun as sweet as karen carpenter
i got high on cheap champagne and pledged my love
next day she ran off with the bass player named rocky and i traded my guitar in for a battered underwood typewriter
on which you will type your way to being one of the most important writers in america
elmos fire rev
on which i continue to turn out obituaries and very little else
taking out shreds of papers and napkins
i cant seem to organize any of my thoughts into anything of any substance
maybe you need to stop thinking so much and fall in love again
the door opens and alec arrives home
he kisses leslie
rough day with the right wing dear
alec hands leslie a red box
she opens it excitedly and finds a black lace nightgown
she screams as alec heads for the kitchen
try it on
leslie makes naughty eyes at kevin and disappears into the bedroom
leslie has to marry me soon
why you pregnant
whats your marriage hurry
when you have a serious relationship kev youll find out the problem with living together its too easy
maybe for you and leslie
you have the perfect relationship
elmos fire rev
s i mean its too easy to get out of
you either build to something bigger like marriage or one day you could make a mistake and the person you were living with is gone
alec takes a bite of dinner and cringes
im going to kill myself
theyre only peppers alec
i cant believe what i just did
i innocently go to buy the nightgown and this amazing blonde salesgirl starts coming on to me
we wind up doing it standing up in front of a three way mirror in the dressing room
he lies down on the floor
if leslie would just marry me i know i wouldnt do stuff like that it would be a legal violation
as opposed to tonights standing violation
you think marriage is going to make you faithful
the idea of two people spending their lives together was invented by people who were lucky to make it to thirty without being eaten by dinosaurs
marriage is obsolete
dinosaurs are obsolete
marriage is still around
leslie screams from the bedroom
elmos fire rev
this is obscene
i love it
alec dashes into the bedroom
as he opens and then closes the door kevin sees a flash of leslie looking absolutely ravishing in the nightgown
as they scream and play kevin feeling very alone stirs the burning dinner
a few hookers work the corner
focus on a black hooker talking to passing car
you want a date
you want a date
kevin passes quietly and she ignores him
why dont you ever ask me if i want a date
cause i thought you were gay
why would you think im gay
cause i never see you with a girl
and you always look real strange
well just for your information
i happen to be in love with someone but they dont know it
i guess you wouldnt understand loving someone from afar
he takes a swig from a bottle in a paper bag
delawares about as far as ive ever gone
is this person a he or a she
she takes the bottle and takes a swig
its a secret
but i guess you wouldnt understand about that either
oh honey lots of people come to me for love and its a secret
he takes his bottle back and goes home
wendy is interviewing a good looking woman with five children crawling all over her

welfare recipients are getting better looking these days

billy sits on her desk
i think im in touch with the feeling
lets go get a drink
billy why arent you at work
billy gives her a look she knows all too well
wendy and billy sit at the bar as kirbo pours
buddy the only extra money i have is my savings for the most important date of my life
elmos fire rev

im ripped between rapture and s torture
s im all tapped out from the accident but i could probably get some from my father
no more money from you wend
but maybe you could help me find another job
do you have any interest in the janitorial field
they both smile
you should be playing your music
im a family man and the rent is due
alec followed by kevin storms into the bar and attacks billy
you dumb shit
you have to start making passes at the women youre supposed to be polling
actually they were the ones who suggested another type of polin
he smiles as alec grabs him
youre twenty three years old
you got a wife and kid
and youre a great american
are you new at this
or just an asshole
elmos fire rev
youre not the fraternity star anymore

billy starts to leave
i didnt bargain for you turning out this way
and i didnt bargain for you turning into a pompous politico
suckin up to hodges

oh no not just a drunk big al
one of the great drunks
born bred and diseased in the s come on

well thats okay cause just remember one thing
you can pick your friends and you can pick your nose but you cant pick your friends nose
wendy looks at alec and starts to laugh

she cant and runs after billy
they are both asleep as the phone rings
alec pulls himself together and speaks alertly

van buren hotel bathroom night s a jules wearing a sexy dress whispers into the phone

leslie watches anxiously as alec throws on his clothes
youre so wonderful taking care of all of us
i love you
i really truly love you
he kisses her
alec gives his car to a valet and rushes into the hotel
the elevator opens and alec quickly finds the room and knocks loudly
after a beat the door is opened by a sedate arab businessman
alec pushes past him
elmos fire rev
four additional sedate arab businessmen sit calmly watching mtv
jules is pacing nervously by the bar smoking
she fakes surprise at alecs entrance
alec what are you doing here
he quickly grabs her and they leave the suite
the arabs hardly notice
okay nobody make a move
vax buren lobby right s jules and alec walk from the elevators
youre a real pal
my indiana jones
i wont forget how you came to my rescue again
they hardly impressed me as the gang bang type jules

she goes toward the public phone

and waste all this good coke
as jules connects with her number alec starts to head out of the hotel in disgust
a beautiful older woman is getting her key from the desk and crosses in front of him toward the elevators
she and alec check each other out
as her elevator arrives she changes her mind and giving alec an inviting smile steps into the dimly lit bar
alec is torn between morality and temptation
temptation wins as he follows the sexy lady
kirbo dressed in his best enters the elegant but empty dining room
searching around quickly he begins to try out various tables
he exchanges floral arrangements at one as the austere maitre d approaches as kirbo peruses a menu
excuse me sir

but this is a table for four
elmos fire rev

with a phone at his table looking at the menu
moneys no object
montrechart or mersalt then and dont forget to smell the cork
okay and how do you say escargot

dale biberman rushes into the restaurant in all her splendor
kirbo is extremely excited

she is gone as the maitre d walks over to him with his pad and speaks with exquisite controlled sarcasm
have you had enough time to look at the menu
kevin and kirbo fold their laundry
you cannot go to med school just to impress this girl with whom you have a fleeting infatuation
this is not just an infatuation and shes not just a girl shes the only evidence of god i can find on this planet with the exception of the mystical
force which removes one of my socks from the dryer every time i do laundry
laundry folded they head out of the laundromat passing the drop off fluff and fold facilities
fluff and fold
im telling you kev when i make it thats where i take my laundry
i understand fold but what is fluff
elmos fire rev
fluff is what i write for the paper

there are certain words my mother finds too horrible to utter so she whispers them
youll get used to it

billy is drinking
wendys mother is talking

one of wendys brothers in law speaks to billy
the day i married rachel i got three card a teria franchises

if youd get married and run a franchise like your sisters you wouldnt need to borrow money
i have a job with the department of human services dad

im very committed and i think i should get my own apart
suddenly one of wendys nephews comes running into the room excitedly
billys up on the roof
the entire family comes running out of the house
billy is way on top of the three story house sitting above the cupola and widows walk his legs dangling
come down from there
what is he crazy
i knew it the minute he walked in the door

wendy joins him

wendys up there with him
wendy and billy ignore them as the family screams and runs back into the house
you miss school dont you

our group being so ultimate so number one
every group on campus thought they were number one

s i was gonna save humanity
i was headed for new york with my sax
to become the new clarence clemmens
then i met felicia and she got pregnant or said she was
wendy looks shocked
by the time i found out she had lied she really was pregnant
why didnt you ever tell me that before
i probably wouldnt have made it in new york anyway
youre very talented billy
school was so damned ultimate
theres no way to go ultimate
but if it all gets too much like just too fucking much
you can end your life at any moment
he dangles his feet dangerously off the edge

billy looks over at her
why didnt you ever tell me that before

brother in law arrives at the window below them
will you get down here before your parents have matching heart attacks
wendy waits in the hallway listening to bedroom doors closing
confident her parents have bedded down she tiptoes back into where billy is drinking heavily at the bar
wendy takes a big gulp
they are both awkward and ap prehensive
she turns out a lamp
so does he but knocks it over
she waits and when she realizes no one has heard the crash she sits down on the small loveseat
billy joins her and going to kiss her knocks her glasses askew
he goes to kiss her again and she responds
he pulls up her skirt and starts to stroke her legs
what the hell is that
her long line panty girdle
whats that your scuba suit
he laughs as wendy is destroyed with mortification
she gets up
elmos fire rev
hey come on wend
youre allowed to laugh when youre screwing
wendy is destroyed as she opens the door
i dont think we should see each other anymore
she pulls out the money her father gave her and places it on a nearby table
theres your rent money
just take it and go away
she starts up the stairs
billy comes to the doorway
she is up the stairs and out of sight
billy feels terrible
he eyes the money on the table and decides not to take it
as he opens the front door white light from the moon glares into the camera as billy moves into the light it becomes whiter more incandescent he becomes a ghostlike
shape that eventually disappears and the screen becomes shimmering white as we a ghoulish halloween mask fills the screen
children run by camera trick or treating revealing the georgetown streets alive with mild halloween shenanigans
jules comes zooming around a corner driving her black jeep
she alec leslie and kevin are in costume
balloons and streamers fly from jules jeep as she pulls up near st
a large paper banner across the window reads live music closer to the window where through the rowdy patrons some in costume we see a trio on a small platform

kirbo is ushering alec kevin leslie and jules to their usual table

he is gone as jules and leslie wave to billy and start toward the ladies room
so i went to see my boss and i thought hed say something presidential like how can i be in banking when i cant even balance my own checkbook
but instead he took me to dinner several times
i was wondering why you havent been sleeping over
jules i dont think you should start bopping your boss

jules shouts across the room to a new arrival
kevin is watching alec kiss leslie when suddenly they are joined by jules neighbor roh
this is my friend and decorator ron dellassandro
you remember ron
this is not kevins night
as ron sits next to him alecs jovial mood suddenly changes
all their eyes move across the room where a very sexy young woman has entered with a noisy blue collar type
but who is she with
kirbo seats them at a small reserved table
alec leslie jules wendy kevin and howie all turn their attention immediately to billy who is playing his heart out until he sees felicia
felicia and blue collar get chummier
billy stops abruptly and jumps from the platform
alec is up in a flash and headed after him
billy arrives at their table
hands off my wife
oh you finally remembered
where were you this past week
i said take your goddamn hands off my wife
blue collar just smiles
billy throws himself on top of him slugging
alec tries to stop them
elmos watches as billy and blue collar beat the shit out of each other
wally the owner arrives with a baseball bat
get him outta here
alec kevin and kirbo get billy moving toward the door
yeah get outta here
you no good shit
felicia is hurling insults at billy as she tends to blue collar
alec and the others drag billy past leslie and jules who look to ron who has been hiding behind them with a hand in front of his face
i just had my nose done

wendy is dying as she watches them take billy out

he pushes his friends away as he lunges into the street to make a grand gesture of marching away
suddenly blue collar comes charging out of the doorway and kicks billy in the back
billy goes down as felicia jumps on him
goddamn you billy
there is pandemonium as felicia and billy pummel each other
alec grabs billy while kevin and kirbo restrain r felicia
as the young couple are being dragged away from each other suddenly felicia cries out to her man
they break away from the friends who are restraining them and rush to each other in the middle of the street
only the very young and the very drunk can get away with this
they collide in sexual frenzy
wendy watches filled with emotions as leslie and jules stand on either side of her
you just go ahead with your evening with howie
no matter what he looks like
leslie glares at jules but wendy starts laughing
a felicia puts ice packs on billys face
leslie and kevin make coffee

kirbo and kevin do laundry
you cant keep ringing doorbells and running away calling her and hanging up
what are you afraid of
total and devastating
as long as she hasnt rejected me theres hope
i have lived with a secret obsession many years myself
however i realize the other person has no interest in me so i pursue my career which is going even more unsuccessfully
who are you in love with
i dont have to share everything with you
my underwear is enough
kirbo if you must pursue this narcissistic mortification that you have decided to call love then you must ask her out on a proper date
like a young god
like alec our leader would
alec has balls
he sees things with his balls
a balls eye view so to speak

i cant help you with your writers block until i see that look in dale bibermans eyes
the look that says she knows im the one for her
kirbo what about all the other women you were going out with

forrester is the greatest
forrester is married
leslie this is the eighties
i bop him for a few years get his job when he gets caught with his hand in the vault
i become a legend do a black mink ad but get caught in a sex scandal
retire in massive disgrace but write a huge bestseller and become the star of my own talk show
silly of us to be concerned
and besides forrester suggested some fabulous alternatives for my stepmonster
thats another thing
you seem obsessed with this womans dying
well it turned out that cremation is almost as expensive as the non torch method so if i dont find a cheaper solution ill probably end up

a limousine arrives and a female chauffeur opens the door for kim sung ho a well dressed korean
kim enters looking over some mail

dale biberman dodging the rain leaves her building and gets in her car
camera finds kirbo across the street watching
he jumps on his bike and follows
a carpark helps dale into the house with an umbrella
camera finds kirbo who looks in the window of the brownstone
dale enters and talks animatedly with two attractive young men
the party is filled with attractive yuppies
dale continues talking with the men as the camera moves through the party toward her
the camera is kirbo
although we do not see him we hear people talking to him
the camera kirbo stops as dale looks up from her con versation
she is pleasant but slightly stunned
how are you
we see kirbo now soaking wet and in pain
thank you very much
dale drives kirbo next to her his bike on the trunk
it has stopped raining
r whats going on
im going to be a doctor
thats not whats going on
they pull up in front of her building and get out of the car
why did you tell me you had to work tonight
why did you lie
i didnt want to hurt your feelings
im obsessed with you dale
i have been for four years
but you dont even know me
but im obsessed by my fantasy of you
dale realizes this man needs some help
kirbo is actually entering dales apartment
im very average
full of flaws
she gestures toward her sloppy bedroom
im a slob
cant even make a bed straight
you ready for more
on a coffee table i steal people magazine from my dentists office
she then goes into the tiny kitchen and picks up a large garbage bag
dale biberman takes out her own garbage
she opens the apartment door as her roommate judith arrives home with a bad cold
heres my roommate judith
she hates me
i hate her
judith disappears into the bedroom as dale puts out the garbage
kirbo sits for a moment alone stunned
and heres the worst of all
when i first decided to be a doctor i thought it was because i wanted to serve people
but now well im beginning to get this funny feeling that what medicines really all about is money
you want some coffee
its money isnt it
thats what youre trying to tell me
its cause i dont have any money
thank you for being so honest
he gets up and leaves
close on billy as he walks across the campus and even tually stops
a few young men stop their activities when they see billy
troy an undergrad big shot arrives
the one and only billy the kid
the guys all cheer as they surround billy
billy plays football with the younger students
he seems happy and home at last
as the others run toward the opposite side of the grounds billy looks to troy
like old times billy boy
you know ive been thinkin troy id like to get some kind of job maybe on campus
you know work with the students or the fraternity
maybe coaching or something
we could use somebody like you around billy
we need somebody to get us some good drugs
billy realizes there is no place for him here either
he looks up to see felicia and the baby
he gives the football to troy and slowly walks across the field
there is a long pause
member ray slater
he was the guy i was goin with before i met you
he came to see me billy and he still wants to marry me
and held take good care of melody and i could probably get an annulment
dont give up on me
i know its been rough on you
but ill get the right job soon
i swear it
no women no booze
you wont believe how ultimate im gonna go
he holds her and she wants to believe him badly
kim sung ho paces the elegant room
i work out of my house
you must be available twenty four hours a day
complete discretion and loyalty
five hundred dollars a week
we now see he is talking to kirbo
im your man mr
your scholastic record is very impressive why would you be willing to leave law school for essentially a gofers position
i dont feel it has any relevancy in the world i want to go into
which world is that
the real world
besides did you know that there are more students in law school than there are practicing lawyers
winter is on the way
dale gets out of her car
as she starts for the hospital a limousine pulls up
kirbo is sitting in the back
what are you up to
i was hand picked as special attache to kim sung ho
you know the famous korean entrepreneur
he quickly holds up a newspaper with kim on the cover
what about medical school
i have to grab my huge financial opportunities while i can
its all about money isnt it dale
well good luck
im giving a little party saturday night at kims house
handing her card id really like to see you there
well thank you kirby
she smiles sweetly and runs off as kirbo sits back and talks to the female chauffeur
shell be there
you see her face when she saw this car
ho catches you having a party in his house saturday night
youll be out on the street
he wont be back until sunday
remember theres an extra hundred bucks for you and kenny to shut up
kirbo proudly drops his laundry off
fluff and fold

the chauffeur waits as kirbo comes proudly out of the laundry
the neighborhood black hooker looks it all over as kirbo pulls away grandly
the smell of fun and sexual contact in the air
party music plays
leslie hangs out the window calling to someone below
well be right down
alec comes from the bedroom getting dressed
honey i just got promoted
im going to have a lot more responsibility
im sure its the right time
looking at my big picture agenda i want to be playing softball with my firstborn in about four years
do you realize that over half the marriages today end in divorce
and the other half dont
my six year old niece asked me today why everyones father doesnt live in a separate house like her father does
i dont want us to become another divorce statistic in newsweek
look at my parents
my father may not come home with a raging hard on anymore but theyre happy
elmos fire rev
t your father sits around playing chess while your mother talks to him constantly
but hes not listening
thats probably why theyre happy
he grabs her leslie lets stop living together get married and start really living together
lets not talk about it tonight
this party means a lot to kirbo
the floors filthy again
just pick a date any date
she opens the door as he grabs a nearby can of white spray paint and sprays the floor white again as they back out through the door
there are some things we have to work out first
leslie locks the door as alec sets the spray can down and they disappear down the victorian stairwell
like my mom always says dont get a hard on
and like my mom always says
marriage makes two people one
but you never know which one
yeah and like my pop says the way to womans heart is to saw her in half
elmos fire rev
they emerge from the building to find wendy and howie in wendys brand new white chrysler lebaron
alec and leslie make a big deal about it as they get in
so does this mean youre officially engaged
it just means im officially thinking about it
what is this
howie didnt you always think women were dying to get married
not to me
a kirbo in his underwear is looking through his employers impressive closet
as he moves in front of a mirror we see kevin watching him from the bedroom
does alec know youre doing this
i told him i had kims permission
should i go for the formaltux or the velvet smoking jacket i do this all the time look
youve left school put yourself into debt lied to alec who got you this job in the first place and all for a woman who doesnt seem to be interested
when she sees me in this setting and realizes my potential which she has always secretly known about me the veil will be stripped from her eyes and she will
give herself to me tonight
elmos fire rev
perhaps in that very bed you are sitting on
is the cummerbund out of style
well excuse me buckeroo
but i think youre a fool
perhaps but a well dressed fool
shots of party beginning alec leslie wendy and howie arrive
other guests arrive including some regulars from st
elmos undergrads and old schoolmates
billy enters and seeing some old frat brothers goes nuts
wendy watches him painfully
holds court for the undergrads
the best advice i can give you undergrads is to fail
failure is a virtue in todays society
human error is a badge of honor
if youre the alcoholic child of a celebrity you can blame them and earn a year on the best seller list
if youre a celebrity your mistake will earn you a people magazine cover
its post watergate morality
take responsibility for your mistakes and make a quick buck while youre at it
then sully snuck the pizza waitress into the showers
they start screaming with laughter
and the fat chick sandy met on a plane
alec and me pretended to be renting agents
she wound up taking on the whole house
everyone laughs as alec looks to billy seriously
im not getting you any more jobs billy
you know al youre so perfect
such a young god
ill bet you were sproutin pubic hairs at the age of three
jules redoes wendys makeup as leslie watches
jules your hands are shaking
she drops the makeup
wendy and leslie are worried
hows your stepmother
the old witch
at least it gives me a chance to funeral shop
did i tell you i found this place in california the neptune society
theyll wrap her up and throw her to the sharks for five hundred dollars
but i have to ship the body all the way out there
wendy and leslie look to each other
kirbo nervously dials the phone
by any chance did dale biberman get called in on emergency duty tonight
he hangs up and tries her home number
wendy steps out to get some air
billy is fooling around inside the house when he notices her through the window
their eyes meet wendy quickly looks away and moves down the back steps
in a few seconds billy comes out onto the back porch
so how you doin
still living at home
yeah how about you
felicia hasnt kicked me out yet
you been playin your sax
i hocked it to pay the phone bill
you forgiven me yet for bein such a horses ass
theres nothing to forgive
in fact i should thank you
it helped me grow up a lot and see how stupid i was
how stupid you were to be caring about a loser like me
i agree with you wholeheartedly
they both pause for a beat
you have a lot of talent billy
so you still a virgin
elmos fire rev
thats none of your business
wendy quickly goes back into the house
billy spits at the moon
kirbo is shouting at an operator on the phone
emergency break in
what do you mean she wont release the phone
did you tell her im giving a party for her
jules is doing coke with kims female chauffeur
alec deep in his cups clinks bottles loudly
big al has an announcement
everyone more or less quiets down
kevin turns down the stereo but not without scratching the record
on june first
leslie will do me the long awaited honor of becoming my bride
youre all invited
everyone rushes to leslie who is stunned
alec youre drunk
alec is already accepting congratulations and passing out cigarettes like cigars as leslie grabs him
alec may i speak to you please
she leads him toward the kitchen as he shouts back st
elmos fire rev
how bout we make it a double wedding
they pass kirbo who dashes out of the kitchen franti cally
he finds wendy
can i use your car
wendy please this is the most important thing in my life
its brand new
a alec and leslie talk as the servants pretend not to eavesdrop
you just want a yearly christmas card with the newberrys in front of the fireplace
youre just afraid to commit
you dont have to slow down your career to help raise them
jesus christ will you just for once not make the reason you wont marry me your fucking career
all right then what will we do about your extra curricular love life
what extra curricular love life

what did kevin tell you
he dashes back into the where people are dancing and cavorting
quickly finding kevin alec punches him with all his might
kevin goes flying
people shout as kevin lands against the stereo taking several thousands of dollars worth of porcelain jade and flowers with him
leslie runs to kevins aid
whatd you tell her
huh whatd you tell her
he told me nothing
it was just a hunch
alec filled with guilt and remorse becomes angrier
alec realizes that everybody in the house is watching him
he must save face
leslie i want you out of the apartment tonight
alec marches out the door
the place is a wreck
its not a party til something gets broken
wendys car still running
kirbo buzzes dales bell and shouts up to her second story window you better get off the phone and open this door
suddenly the window above him opens and dales roommate judith appears angrily
are you the maniac trying to cut in on my line
where is dale
she went skiing
why should i tell you
because im not responsible for what ill do to you if you dont
kevin and leslie walk together silently
kevin sees they are approaching his neighborhood black hooker
he proudly takes leslies arm
hell show her whos gay
you think you aint gonna pay
kevin enters and quickly starts to pick up
i havent been here for a long time
its still the same
small and ugly
but then again its small and ugly
are you sure we shouldnt find you some nice lady like hotel
no ill be fine here for tonight as long as im not putting you or kirbo to any trouble
what are you doing
with a coffin
we now see that a long coffee table which has always been covered with junk is indeed a black coffin
thats not how youre supposed to ask
youre supposed to be a young lady who is very impressed with
having come from a deep hungarian film and getting cozy over a brandy she says
and then i say yes its my coffin your coffin she would gasp her interest in me growing by leaps and bounds
theni would sit back stroking her arm and say yes i figured were going to spend a long time in the ground together so ive made friends with it
ive gotten drunk on it
rolled joints on it even made love on it many times
its a prop for affect
does it work
how would i know
well you better not let jules see it
shell steal it for her stepmother
are these relatives of yours
she holds up a beautiful photograph of a very beautiful distinguished family
no thats more effect
he opens a straw box obviously filled with his most personal possessions and extricates a photograph of a very ordinary family
you remember my family
so ive wandered into a real woman trap here havent i
except youre the first woman ive ever been able to get up here
and ive blown all my props already
so how about some brandy
kevin searches for clean glasses in the debris that passes for a kitchen leslie finds photos and political cartoons in his straw box
eventually she finds a photo of herself and then another followed by dozens more
kevin has an entire homage to her in his secret stash
he comes back with the brandy to find her looking at the photos
am i part of your props
youre the real thing
he quickly starts pouring the brandy as leslie looks at kevin almost for the first time
it is starting to snow
kirbo drives frantically
as snowflakes begin to hit the windshield he grabs for the windshield wiper
not knowing how it works he forces it the wrong way
the handle comes off in his hand
elmos fire rev
much brandy has been had
alec was the first
there were other guys in high school boys but he was the first love of my life
i always wondered if alec and i hadnt ended up in the same dorm well i guess i would have just found someone else
and so would he
alec had the luck of geography
whatever we say about alec well regret tomorrow
what do you think about our relationship
as an outsider
oooo dangerous question
sometimes i think i just hang around with you and alec cause
well since he introduced me to you
and i think the reason im not interested in other women
is cause i
tears of joy kevin
all this time right in front of us
how could i have been so blind
leslie we wont even remember this tomorrow
it is tomorrow
there is a mad moment of hesitation and then kevin and leslie smash into each others arms
i love you
ive always loved you
they kiss madly passionately
they fall to the floor in a frenzy
leslie pulls kevins hair
as she stops no
i love it
i love it
leslie grabs onto the large throw rug as they roll around the floor
somehow as they roll and turn the rug gets wrapped around them
leslie tears at his shirt as he yanks her sweater off
kevin fights madly with the back of leslies bra
he is going berserk trying to find the clasp
its in front
with a flick of her hand she undoes her bra and opens up the wonders of paradise to her old buddy
they kiss madly again as they roll in the rug
leslie and kevin fuck on the floor on the coffin in the shower
all over the apartment
the worst turnpike in the world
kirbo swerves on the slushy lanes
fortunately he is the only car on the road
recently in a life and death situation i had the bad luck to use one of your so called luxury cars
finally he sees a large sign reading seven springs

you should know
elmos fire rev
come on gimme some of those beautiful lips
jules needs some attention
the hot couple kiss
he immediately goes for the gold
yeah well i bet you really wont have so much to say with me in your mouth
he kisses her wildly as she pushes him away aggressively
im serious billy
he grabs the keys from the ignition as the car dies
holding her off with one hand he shoves the keys into his underwear and then sits back grinning
come and get em
she attacks him biting his hands his neck and his chest
billy shrieks with laughter and pain
he tumbles out of the jeep onto the street laughing and shouting
jules tumbles right after him belting pinch ing biting
as she goes to kick him billy slides between her legs and looks up under her skirt
elmos fire rev
s a she sits down an his chest undoes his pants and gets her keys
felt up with all she heads back to the jeep
i really needed you tonight
nell just get back in the jeep and assume the missionary position
you break my heart
you break everybodys heart
she drives off in the jeep
billy fumbles with his pants and then turns toward his house
felicia holding their baby stands watching from the porch
obviously having seen most of this she silently goes back into the house
locks the door and turns out the light
alone drunk and bewildered billy starts moving away from the house real izing he has no place to go
kirbo is still driving frantically but without the windshield wipers snow is building rapidly on the wind shield
kirbo with one hand on the wheel hangs out of the car using his left hand to wipe off the snow
he searches the dashboard frantically
wheres the defroster
he rams and jams every button and knob in sight as he weaves dangerously on the freeway
eventually one of the levers comes off in his hand
i recently had the misfortune of using one of your so called new luxury cars in an emergency situation
so much for american enterprise
a kirbo tries to stop the car in front of a cabin but it slides further than he had planned and almost hits it
getting out and trudging through the snow in his party clothes
he bangs on the door
who is it
is dale biberman in there
who wants to know
and who the hell are you
the door swings open and there stands guy a handsome thirty year old wrapped in a blanket
dale comes from the bedroom fastening a mans robe and staring at kirbo in disbelief
what are you doing here
his entire world has collapsed
he cant swear shout or cry he can only dash toward the car frantically
falling in the snow once or twice he eventually jumps into the car and tries to peel out but it just spins in the snow
meanwhile guy has put on heavy boots and comes running out to the car where kirbo stands on the gas to no avail
he ignores her maniacally as he keeps desperately trying to get out of there
youve got no skid chains or snow tires
youve got no traction
kirbo ignores them
you re not gonna get out of here tonight
you better come back inside
ill stay in the car
yelling at dale he wants to stay in the car
she begins pulling on her boots as guy tries to reason with kirby
people have died out here
leave me alone
im not your responsibility
dale has joined them
by driving up here youve made us responsible for you
now come inside
kirbo sits in front of the fire wrapped in a blanket
guy goes back into the bedroom as dale finishes making a bed for him on the sofa
your clothes should be dry in a few hours
hes a doctor isnt he
here are some pajamas
you expect me to wear his pajamas
well talk in the morning
she joins guy in the bedroom and closes the door
kirbo is left with the pajamas and his desperate anguish
the room is destroyed as leslie and kevin lie on the floor blissfully in each others arms
they hear the front door open
no its alec
kevin and leslie look at each other frantically
i gave him a key
alec miserable hungover having walked all night in the cold shuffles around the living room
im only gonna ask you this once
did you tell leslie about my screwing around
kevin looks to leslie as they wonder how to handle this
alec has found a beer
i believe you
i want you to know that i believe you and kev im sorry i hit you
shit howd she find out
how long has she known
ive been thinking all night about school
how sex was always a barometer especially at the fraternity
the more women you got the more of a man you were
or thought you were
i thought i was
shit my whole life at school revolved around sex
even after i fell in love with leslie
i always had to be doing better than the next guy
i had my rep
it all started as a game
kevin gingerly comes from the bedroom in a robe
i kind of have company
i never thought
who is it
that fat chick from the party
you and the fat chick
alec ill call you later
alec capitulates and leaves the apartment
kevin relaxes just as alec pops back in
just tell me if its the fat chick
the bedroom door opens and leslie appears wrapped in a sheet
wait a minute
i dont believe it
this could not be real
there is no way this is happening
it happened alec
little fuckin kevin
my little buddy
no way jose
he didnt do it alone alec
alec moves toward kevin with murder as his intent
kevin takes a stand
i know that if we fight youre going to win
but im warning you i will use every bone in my body every lamp in this room to make sure i inflict as much damage as possible on you before
you bring me down
kevin prepares for the fight
youre both pathetic
i dont want to see either one of you again ever
you understand me
you see me on the street you see me at st
elmos just pretend you dont know me
on his exit alec takes a lamp and throws it against a woody allen photograph on the wall
kevin and leslie look at each other uncertain of what they have done
a taxi delivers mr
ho to his front door
ho enters to find a big mess from the party and wendy and howie asleep in the living room
he took my new car
a guy is heating up the block of wendys car with a couple of hair dryers on long extension cords
he shouts toward the open door of the cabin
and the roads look pretty clear
dale is doing dishes kirbo hasnt touched his break fast
he looks suicidal and possessed
i had no idea it had gone this far
i gave up school
and my job at st
and you never even knew about it
its kind of funny isnt it
dale sits down next to him
the reason i didnt know
is because all of this happened between you and you
i could never participate because i never knew what was expected of me
love isnt like this kirby
its mutual and reciprocal
guy yells to them from outside
okay shes starting
you better get out of here before it starts snowing again
guy sits in wendys car making everythng hum
dale escorts kirbo
guy gets out of the car
wait a minute
ive got to get a picture of you old college chums
he goes into the cabin
dale sees kixbos pain
i dont really know you well
but you seem like a fine person and i want you to know that im flattered by all of this and deep down im sure for a long time ill
wonder if maybe this somehow isnt my loss
she kisses him gently on the cheek
he is about to sink into more pain when suddenly he grabs dale and kisses her with all the passion he has for her
when he releases her she is dazed
something has definitely happened
they turn to face guy and his polaroid camera
after he takes their photo he hands it to kirbo who hands it to daleand quickly gets into the car
arent you going to wait for it to develop
kirbo drives off quickly
dale gets smaller and smaller
the polaroid picture becomes clear of kirbo and dale
she is smaller and smaller
a kind of win fills his senses
the mirror the polaroid the snow the sun they fuse together in a brilliant incandescent white light that fills the screen
in this glaw we rapidly
beamish love comes later
marriage family the family business children carrying on the parents traditions
dad i have my own work and i want to get my own apartment
all right keep your job til you get pregnant
howie is a fine boy
you dont need your own apartment

hes talented and confused and hes not a lowlife
and i love him because hes alive

when he looks at you all he sees is u money
he doesnt give a damn about you
wendy has started to cry
im warning you young lady

wendy is overcome with grief
i hate you dad
i really hate you now
she rushes from the counter grabbing her coat
wendy rushes into the street crying
shots of lunchtime in d
clerks pages government employees of all description leave work and venture forth for the lunch ritual
wendy leaves the welfare office and hurries down the street
she comes to the window of a modest coffee shop and looks inside
her father is waiting for her
wendy and her father sit at a counter facing the camera
they finish ordering as the waitress leaves them
some place this is
your car fixed
i got a personal letter from lee lacocco
they fixed everything for nothing
so you like the car
its a great car dad but i cant keep it
i dont feel right about driving a car like that and working with people who cant afford to eat
she finds the keys and hands them to him
keep the car
you and howie are going to need it
im giving howie back too
wendy listen to me
you think i wanted to marry your mother
i was pressured into it
she was pressured into it
i dont love howie
beamish comes running after her
wendy keeps running
a bag lady from the soup kitchen crosses her path
wendy ignores her as she keeps running
beamish suddenly gets a cramp in his leg
oh my god my leg
wendy continues running and crying as young street toughs run past her
dont worry wendy
we got the old pervert covered
wendy keeps running but then looks back
the street toughs are giving her father a hard time as he puffs wheezes and deals with the pain in his chest and his leg
wendy cant stand it
she shouts at them
thats my father
you leave him alone
thats my father
she runs over to them and shoos the toughs away
still crying she guides her father toward a stoop
sit down daddy
they sit down both still very emotional
after a moment mr
beamish takes a torn greeting card from his pocket
it has a very sexy woman on it
a feminist came into the pennsylvania avenue store this morning called me a sexist and a pig and tore the card up
i said listen we got naked men on cards too with their pee pees hanging out
we got men and we got women
and she spit in my face
daddy im sorry
im sorry i said i hated you
im sorry about howie
you dont have to marry anybody you dont want to marry and if you want to move out well move out
he starts to get up with her help
dont judge your mother and me so hard
and the way we raised you and your sisters
theres no training to be a parent you know
youre learning every day on the job
they start back toward the restaurant
theres no training to be me either dad
im learning on the job too
he hugs her as they walk back into the restaurant
leslie enters carrying several empty cardboard boxes
she shakes off her many emotions and tries to efficiently gather her things
beginning with record albums she accidentally knocks an ashtray to the floor
as she picks up the broken pieces the door opens from the bedroom
alec appears looking horrible in his bathrobe
i especially took off work because i thought you wouldnt be here
noticing an album hey you cant take the pretenders first album
i bought it
you did not
you can have all the billy joels
except for the stranger
im taking thriller and mahlers ninth
kevin is so fond of mahler
ive moved in with jules
no springsteen is leaving this house
but you can have all the w carly simons

when there were still valentines around here
you ran out on this relationship
you take the consequences
i didnt run out on anything
you ran out
you fucked kevin
you fucked manyl nameless faceless manyl oh i feel much better now
alec angrily grabs another album from her
youre not taking the police so just forget it
i didnt fuck kevin
i was confused and angry
and i care for him deeply
no more albums
get your clothes and give me the keys
leslie reluctantly hands him the keys and moves toward the bedroom closet slowly
i dont believe this is happening to us
alec sits down angrily on the new sofa clutching his albums
i wish i could get it all back
dealing with her emotions she drives jules jeep through the georgetown streets
the back of the jeep is filled with her clothes etc
kevin is waiting on the doorstep with flowers champagne and a stack of newspapers
as leslie pulls up he greets her by pressing a newspaper against the windshield
after a moment she focuses on a small article entitled the meaning of life obser you did it
leslies stuff is still in boxes
kevin fixes a fire as leslie re reads his article sipping champagne
god this is so exciting
your first byline
im sure ill be back doing obits tomorrow
youre going to really attract some attention with this
did somebody actually say i believe in the golden rule whoevers got the gold makes the rule
leslie i couldnt write anything of any meaning until you
he kisses her warmly
he aggressively gets on top of her and feeling the excitement and the champagne kisses her madly
the front door opens and jules appears breathless
dont you two ever use a bed
leaving the door wide open she races through the apart ment
kevin continues to madly attack leslie when ron carrying packages arrives at his door across the hall
he and kevin exchange a look as ron goes inside
let me show jules your piece
she grabs a paper and starts for the hall
she stops for a moment as she sees jules using her long pinky nail deftly take a couple of pops of coke
unaware that leslie is watching jules starts back down the hall
kevin has his first byline
jules is so stoked she cant focus
tract housing in maryland
no its the other piece
got to fly
forrester the magnificent animal is waiting
did the hospital call

jules id like to meet him
ill have him wave up to you
she is out the door in a flash as leslie moves toward the window
doesnt she seem out of control to you
since the day i met her
they look out of the window
down below jules jumps into a small dark mercedes helped by a slightly nefarious looking hunk
they wave to leslie
jules boss and lover
international banking seems to be getting sexier
speaking of which
as she closes the window kevin attacks her again
kevin ive been thinking
me too and i dont like to count my cornish hens before they hatch but i do think ill be getting a raise
and i was thinking we could get a place together
i know its fast
but i also know i love you
i dont think you do love me
i mean we love each other as friends
kevin you were sitting on all these incredible feelings
all tied up in that box with my pictures in desperate need of a love affair
well i needed to break the alec habit
and its only natural i would turn to you in my confusion
but this doesnt feel real
it feels manufactured
its me isnt it
are you kidding
youre a little a miracle
but not a big miracle like alec
oh alec was the big miracle for a long time
but i think id like to try life without any miracles for a while
kevin realizes how serious leslie is
well having your first byline and losing the love of your life in the same night has a certain the gods must be laughing at me feeling
im not the love of your life
but youre a girl what do you know
leslie embraces him with deep friendship
kevin and kirbo are watching the and of annie hall
on screen woody says goodbye to diane keaton
i realized what a terrific person she was and how much fun it was knowing her and i thought of that old joke you know this guy goes to a
psychiatrist and says doc uh my brothers crazy
he thinks hes a chicken and the doctor says well why dont you turn him in
and the guy says i would but i need the eggs
well i guess thats pretty much how i feel about relationships
you know theyre totally irrational and crazy and absurd and
guess we keep going through it because uh most of us need the eggs
kevin and kirbo walk away from the theater advertising the woody allen festival
i dont think i need the eggs anymore
dale biberman gave me enough cholesterol for a lifetime
you were right all along
ive had second thoughts
intimacy is dangerous and shattering
but ultimately necessary
but kevin i used to wait outside her house
ring the bell and then when shed come to the window id run away
just to get a glimpse of her
the night leslie gave me the kiss off i fucked a black hooker three times
not naomi from our corner
naomi from our corner
i think you better go to the doctor and get some shots
i used a rubber
she put it on me with her mouth
they stop as they reach st
looking inside they see alec at his usual table
alec is playing his old quarter game but with tommy bancroft and his new political friends
i always thought wed be friends forever
forever got a lot shorter suddenly
they move on passing a sign on the door waiter warted
kevin points to it
no as soon as i get back in school im going to work part time for a law firm
did you know there are as many people in law school as there are practicing lawyers
howd she put the rubber on with her mouth
a well dressed female executive secretary looks disturbed as she enters a formidable office
she returns with a distinguished gentleman in a grey suit
he approaches leslie who is waiting anxiously
yes may i help you
i want to see forrester davidson jr
i am forrester davidson jr
leslie is shocked and even more confused
well there must be some mistake
ive come to see julianna van patten and they told me she doesnt work here anymore
alec is on a phone and talking to co workers at the same time
he looks up to see leslie very shaken waiting across the room
he is immediately angered but eventually gets off the phone and joins her
did you forget one of your albums
im sorry to bother you here
after she left for work this morning the finance company came and took away all her furniture her jeep everything they could get their hands on
i couldnt reach her so i finally went over to her office
alec she was fired three weeks ago
all this time shes been pretending to go to work every day and pretending to be still having this affair with her boss
and shes been doing a lot of coke well anyway i confronted her at the apartment and at first she denied everything but then she went crazy and now shes
locked herself in the apartment and she wont let me back in
im really worried about her
alec hesitates angrily
i need your help
alec knocks on the door with leslie
jules open the door
leslie puts her key in the door
dead locks and a heavy bolt prevent it from opening
shes in there
a jules come on
just open the door
the main room is empty and dark except for jules who sits on the floor dressed only in a thin t shirt and bikini pants
thin tired no makeup this is a differ ent jules than we have seen before
freezing winds shoot through the open window
jules remember my junior year when i went cold turkey on cigarettes
you sat up with me all night in the commons room feeding me emergency carrots
jules if you dont let us in were going to have to call the police
there is a beat and then jules speaks from the depths of hell
ill throw myself out the window before they get through the door
not my greatest ploy
jules remember the time i flunked art history and i was trying to drink myself to death
kevin and kirbo come dashing up the stairs breathlessly
how is she
she just threatened to throw herself out the window
kevin and alec have a moment of awkwardness
the fire escape
alec kevin and kirbo climb up the fire escape
they arrive at the second floor to find burglar proof grill work locked in place but the windows are still wide open
through the iron bars they see jules
jules what are you doing
the three young men start tearing at the bars frantically
leslie pounds on the door
jules youre really scaring me now
alec kevin and kirbo cannot budge the bars
the whole country is
falling apart but these five bars are made perfectly
we need something that cuts through metal
or an experienced thief
ill find billy
kirbo dashes down the fire escape
i was kidding
billys working at the big chevron station on michigan
he must have a hacksaw or something
kirbo takes off on his bike as alec looks at kevin
billy is working in a gas station
he needed the money
suddenly alec and kevin become aware that they are alone
i saw your article
yeah well yesterdays editorial achievement is todays garbage wrapper right
kevin tries to laugh charmingly
alec tries to laugh along with him but suddenly rage returns
you little shit
he grabs kevin
kevin tries to fight back but alec is so overpowering he pushes kevin up to the railing of the fire escape and then pushes him over
kevin hangs upside down as alec holds him by his legs
dozens of scraps of paper fall from his pocket
leaning out the apartment hallway window leslie sees them
leslie runs screaming through the hall and down the stairs passing ron dellassandro who is just coming home from work
kevin still hanging upside down tries to hang on to alec
papers continue to fly
you wont need any more notes on the meaning of life
upside down im kinda betting on you not doing it al
think of your political career
leslie runs into the alley underneath them
alec stop iit
she frantically starts climbing the fire escape
after all ive done for you
i feel ive done a lot for you too al
so pull me up and well call it even
what you did for me was take the woman i was going to marry
the woman he was going to marry arrives frantically onto their landing
she struggles with alec
alec stop it right now
below them billy and kirbo pull up in a chevron tow truck
billy wearing chevron coveralls jumps out with an acetylene torch in hand shouting
looks pretty ultimate up there
he helps kirbo who is struggling with a two wheeler dolly holding a large tank of oxygen and acetylene
you think this is helping jules
with kevins life still in his hands he suddenly remembers jules
looking back inside he sees her still in the same posi tion freezing
he slowly pulls kevin onto the fire escape
are you all right
kirbo tries to get the dolly up the fire escape with billy
kevin goes down the fire escape to help him leaving alec and leslie alone
leslie kneels by the window with her hands on the iron bars and speaks to jules
oh my god
jules please its so cold
very noble how you ran up here to save your lover
hes not my lover
i have never lied to you once since the day i met you
you cocky shithead
alec knows its the truth
hang on jules
we all love you
she has been holding onto the bars with her bare hands but the bitter cold makes her wince as she removes her hands
alec is overwhelmed with feelings as he takes her hands and holds them to his mouth breathing warm breath onto them
much emotion passes between them
your breath your breath is so sweet
leslie im sorry
im so profoundly sorry
kirbo and kevin arrive
billy races down the alley
give it to me
do not hand him a blowtorch
kevin takes the torch and goes for the bars
sparks and fire fly
suddenly there is a phenomenal pounding from inside the apartment at jules front door
it stops everyone on the fire escape
the pounding jolts jules
billy pounds on the door as ron watches nervously
jules its billy
open the door
open up the goddamn door or im coming right through it
billy spots a large metal fire extinguisher at the end of the hall
you want some coffee ron
ron enters tentatively and joins them as jules and billy start shouting and laughing louder
you know until today i thought gay people were nuts
billy sits on the floor playing his sax soulfully
reveals its wendys apartment
it is partially painted and a large ladder stands in the room
wing chair has fabric swatches on it
cartons books etc
wendy sits on the floor watching billy
then what happened
that was it
we came out of the bedroom and had coffee with everybody
you saved her life
lets not get dramatic
so when did you get so sane
when i realized how insane ive been all this time tryin to be like alec and leslie
and you and kevin
im not part of this post college georgetown life marriage and jobs
felicia and melodyll be better off without me
did she get remarried already
three or four weeks
i was thinkin of hanging around tryinto be one of those in the neighborhood dads
but it would just confuse everybody
new yorkll suit me fine
if somebodyll let me play sax
this is great
ill tell you whats great
last night i woke up in the middle of the night and made myself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
and you know it was my kitchen and my refrigerator and my apartment and it was the best peanut butter and jelly sandwich ive ever had in my life
they chuckle together and then they become more serious
so youre goin huh
she picks up his sax and blows a few comic notes
so are you still a virgin
why is my sexual status so important to you
have i abused our relationship too much
or could i be so bold
as to ask you for a going away present
wendy is moved
lying on the floor of her bedroom
only a candle lights the room
billys face comes into frame and they kiss tenderly at first and then more passionately
wendy looks beautiful and she and billy are filled with a tenderness and love that can only exist from the years they have shared together
the sax builds as the wonder of the two young lovers builds
a large bus pulls out as leslie stands at a coffee vending machine
need someone to blow on your hands
she smiles but shows him her gloves
as she searches for change in her pockets alec stops her and puts his own coins in the machine
he presses buttons as he talks
did you know that i
always wanted to make you coffee
i tried once when you were in the shower but it didnt turn out right so i threw it out and cleaned everything up so you wouldnt know
i dont like doing things im not good at like making coffee and saying im sorry
he looks at her sincerely as he hands her the plastic cup from the machine
leslie im sorry
they exchange a tender glance and then leslie takes a sip from the steaming cup
alec this is soup
this is soup
alecs nervousness turns to embarrassment as they both start to laugh
old feelings surge
i love you
they look at each other for a moment
we need time
elmos fire rev
kirbo comes running over
the bus is leaving
alec and leslie join him and they quickly move to where jules
kevin and wendy are saying goodbye to billy who has his suitcase and sax
a bus waits
she hugs him expansively
billy next kisses leslie and shakes hands with the guys at the same time
wendy waits until last and then they embrace emotionally
she whispers into his ear
billy smiles at her as she fights tears
ill keep in touch
no you wont
he wants to say more to all of them but the bus is wait ing and he hops on it
the door closes and the bus backs out of the terminal
billy stands near the driver and waves out at them
watch him pull away
as it pulls backward we can see billy with his friends reflections on the buss windshield superimposed over his
the buss headlights flare into the camera
the images of all of them mix with the white hot glare superimposed over this for a brief second we see images of them all from past from school from
the screen goes totally white with incandescent brilliance as we alec leslie kevin krbo wendy and jules walk together slowly
coming upon st
f mos they stop
looking in the window
they see their old tables filled with younger students led by claton the undergrad
