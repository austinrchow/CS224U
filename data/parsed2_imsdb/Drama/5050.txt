written by will reiser its another picture perfect day in san diego
the beaches golf courses and yacht clubs are packed with hundreds of rapturous citizens
a bus pulls up and unloads its passengers
we follow adam schwartz a kind faced mild mannered pragmatist who despite his youth has the cynicism of an old man
he steps off the bus crosses the street and approaches adam enters the hospital
the mood is calm
all the chaos one would expect to find in a hospital of this size is tucked away behind the sterile and monochrome walls
adam walks to the reception counter
the receptionist is engrossed with the latest edition of us weekly
she ignores adam who just stands there awkwardly unsure of what to do
adam gives out a small cough to grab her attention
the receptionist keeps her eyes fixed on her magazine
can i help you
i have an appointment
the receptionist says nothing
adam stands silent not knowing what to do
he coughs again
annoyed the receptionist looks up but says nothing
um am i supposed to go somewhere
with her eyes the receptionist points to the waiting area
oh should i go sit
the receptionist rolls her eyes and returns to her magazine
adam looks around the empty waiting room
he takes a seat and browses through a dozen outdated magazines highlights time life modern maternity etc
only moments later as though he hadnt just introduced himself the receptionist calls out adam schwartz
adam looks around the waiting room
theres no one else there
again the receptionist calls out again adam schwartz
yeah thats me
the receptionist leads adam to a small changing room and hands him a hospital gown
put this on
do i need to take off all my clothes
the receptionist stares blankly at adam
ill figure it out
the receptionist leaves
adam awkwardly undresses and slips on the hospital gown
unsure which end of the gown is the front adam adjusts the garment a few times until he decides he has it right
adam pulls back the curtain of the changing room to find joanne an overly cheery nurse
hi adam my name is joanne so nice to meet you
adam scratches his chest the hospital gown is beginning to irritate his skin
you dont happen to have anything in a cotton blend
joanne hands adam a giant specimen cup marked with a thick yellow line
now im going to need you to fill this cup with urine
you think you can do that
you want me to fill this entire cup
adam looks down at the cup in total disbelief
its gonna take me at least a week to fill this
can i take it home
take it home
youre so funny
the camera pans to reveal a group of medical students taking diligent notes in the background
we pan again this time to the next room adam struggles to fill the cup
after a few beats theres a knock on the door
you okay in there adam
just another minute
adam looks down at the empty cup in frustration
the camera pans to the next room adam stands in front of an x ray machine
the apathetic technician has him stand in a dozen uncomfortable positions for long periods of time sideways one arm in the air then the other arm on one leg then
the other one leg in the air then the other and so on
again we see the group of medical students taking notes
the camera pans to the next room joanne pulls out a giant needle
here comes the choo choo
in the back we see the med students still taking notes
the camera pans to the next room adam is lying on the gurney of an mri machine
he is slowly drawn into the enclosed body scanner
now make sure you lie completely still
otherwise well have to do it all over again
which were not going to have to do right
adam lies perfectly still in the enclosed body scanner
is anybody out there
theres no one there
hes been left unattended
the mri technician is watching the laker game in the next room
i have to pee
the med students continue to take notes
through the window of the hospital the camera pulls out and pans across the san diego skyline
we watch as the sun sets to night then rises to morning
its a gray morning as the thick spring fog slowly begins to lift
with no one in sight the only sound that can be heard is that of the waves crashing onto the shoreline and then rolling back out to the pacific ocean
about a mile inland we come upon rows of identical two and three bedroom town houses with lawns groomed to perfection fill the community
this is southern california suburbia
the sound of the waves crashing gets increasingly louder and louder as we push in on the interior of adams house is spotless
pictures on the walls adam and his dad sailing
adam and his parents at his bar mitzvah
adam and his best friend seth at high school graduation
a university of berkeley hat
a national academic achievement award in the sciences
curled in a fetal position adam sleeps peacefully next to rachel his loving girlfriend
cute charming and artsy rachel is winnie cooper all grown up
the sound of the waves crashing stops abruptly
a loud obnoxious alarm clock goes off
startled adam jumps up
drenched in sweat and completely disoriented he looks around in confusion
after a moment adam pulls an earplug out of each ear and turns off the alarm
the sound of the crashing waves turns back on
adam pushes a button on the alarm clock and the sound of the waves stops but the loud obnoxious alarm returns
he pushes the clock again
the alarm turns off but now we hear the sound of crickets chirping
again adam pushes a button this time we hear the sound of a loud thunder rain storm he pushes a button again this time we hear the sound of loud
clanging church bells
rachel rolls over asleep and incoherent make it stop
it wont turn off
frustrated adam tries pushing all the buttons
this only makes it worse
we hear all of the previous sounds simultaneously sound off
rachel rolls over and moans as she puts a pillow over her head
adam reaches down and unplugs the alarm clock bringing an end to the noise
he sits for a moment at the edge of the bed collects himself
adam looks down at rachel and begins kissing her neck
rachel gently strokes her fingers through adams hair
something catches her attention a single strand of hair
she holds it up
oh my god
i think you have a gray hair
im gonna pull it out
dont touch it
adam jumps from bed
he rushes into the bathroom
rachel rolls back to sleep
adam stands in front of the mirror and searches for the gray hair
once he finds it he holds it out for a closer look
it is in fact a gray hair
as adam showers he tries to squirt shampoo into his hand but the bottle is empty
he looks over at rachels large assortment of shower products finds one that smells pleasant fructis by loreal and squirts some into his hair
he then proceeds to lather his entire body in the product
adam dresses in front of the bathroom mirror
his outfit is well put together but not what you would expect of someone his age more of a mr
he pulls out a lint brush and meticulously combs his cardigan
seth pulls up in front of adams house in his white neon and honks the horn
on the bumper is a sticker lets put the christ back in christmas
overweight well dressed and wearing an air of confidence seth pulls out a massive joint lights it and takes a hit
just then seth looks over at young school children and their mother waiting for the school bus
the mothers jaw is on the ground in shock
seth hides the joint and smiles in embarrassment
beautiful day isnt it
the mother quickly moves her kids out of sight
adam approaches seths car
he spots his neighbors andrew and missy donnelly late s getting into their car
they wave to adam
sorry about the noise last night
adam shrugs as if to say what the fuck
andrew and missy giggle as they get into their car
adam gets into the car
whats that smell
are you wearing perfume
well you smell like the cast of steel magnolias
i ran out of shampoo
i had to use rachels
for a second there i thought maybe youd fucked olympia dukakis
adam tries to close his window
the child safety lock is on
can you unlock my window
theres a lot of pollen in the air
seth ignores adam and turns up the music
seriously my allergies are flaring up
it feels like my nasal cavities are on fire
adam begins to clear his throat seth turns the music even louder
sorry musics too loud its making it hard for me to hear your whining
we see the morning bustle as business men and women stand in line waiting for their morning coffee
adam and seth stand at the end of that line watching the young couple in front of them who cant keep their hands off of each other
i dont get it that guy is clearly a total douchebag
hes wearing capris
rachel and i used to be like that like two wild animals in heat
i guess it is only natural though as we get older more mature things begin to slow down
sex every three weeks is normal
you havent had sex in three weeks
you think maybe shes mad cause i havent asked her to move in
what the fuck are you talking about
i dont think shes waiting for you to ask anything
youre using her shampoo
next thing youll be using her tampons
seth laughs at his own joke
but seriously let me get this straight she has her own place yet she spends every night with you in your bed but she wont sleep with you
its not that big a deal
so when does it become a big deal
my cut off
thats when i begin to worry
do you realize how lucky i am to be with rachel
look around there are like a million rachels in this city alone
well shes kind of hot so maybe half a million
but theyre not rachel
i dont know how to explain it but being with her just feels right
and im not going to overlook that just cause were in a lull
my parents are in a lull which is what happens after years of marriage
youve only been dating her four months
at our age sex is all we have
every time she refuses to sleep with you a small piece of every mans soul dies
shes killing us adam
youre a semi smart semi successful semi average looking dude
just based on that you could get with at least one third of the female population
adam and seth step up to the counter
theyre greeted by the super gay barista who loves his job way too much
would you sleep with my friend
like right now
no just in general
yeah id fuck him
the barista yells to demetri the other barista
hey demetri fuckable
demetri examines adam
hes not impressed with what he sees
id let you blow me
see this is what im saying
the barista hands seth and adam two cups of coffee they each leave a dollar
adam and seth enter the museum
they pass jenny at the information desk
good morning jenny
jenny ignores them
i love you
phil the museums vivacious director approaches
phil sniffs the air and looks at adam
are you wearing perfume
its rachels shampoo
phil goes in for a closer sniff
then an even closer sniff
adam looks uncomfortable
fructis by loreal
my wife uses that
what are you wearing
seths eyes open wide as phil goes in for a sniff
what is that
seth spots a group of second graders with their teacher assembled by the entrance
looks like my group is here
seth slaps on a button that reads docent and rushes off to greet the students
see you guys later
phil turns to adam
hows the origins exhibit coming along
were almost done with upper paleolithic
im counting on you not to screw up
looks into adams eyes youre the only one i can trust
the board is talking about bringing in sponsors
were a dying art adam
phil stares into adams eyes for what feels like an eternity
its incredibly awkward
i should probably get to work
thats probably a good idea
phil looks at the clock a
i think im gonna go to lunch
phil wanders off
adam and greg adams slightly moronic co worker place the finishing touches on the cro magnon exhibit its an elaborate life sized diorama depicting the life of a family of
four cro magnons
outside their hut its snowing but inside theres a large fire and decorative horse drawings on the walls
the man instructs his son to paint as the woman teaches her daughter to sew
we see greg positioning the fossil of a velociraptor next to the mother and daughter
the dinosaur looks poised to pounce
what are you doing
its a velociraptor
where did it come from
the dinosaur exhibit
off adams look why cant we just say it was the first domesticated pet
people love dinosaurs
adam cringes in frustration
greg you cant just
thats a million year old fossil
just please put it away before someone sees it
greg reluctantly goes to put the dinosaur away
he flaps the dinosaurs arm in the air waving goodbye to adam
seth leads his tour of second graders
he speaks like a tour guide at universal studios
coming up here on our left is the origins of man exhibit on loan from the smithsonian institute
it wont be open to the public for a few more months so youre one of the first groups to see it
adam looks up
he hates this part of his job
everyone this is adam hes the curator of ancient civilizations here at the museum
adam gives a reluctant wave
why dont you tell us what were looking at
this here is a family of homo sapiens who lived in europe about years ago
in excitement the kids move in for a closer look
unaffected the teacher stays back and files her nails
these cro magnons as theyre often called are the closest in the evolutionary chain to modern day humans
kid touches the cro magnon father
still talking adam steps in and moves kid s hand off
what made cro magnon so advanced was their sense of community
they were the first to settle on a single plot of land devote to one partner raise a family and take care of the sick
this is lame
i thought you said we were gonna see dinosaurs
see i told you
seth points to a life sized neanderthal man holding a spear
who wants to hear about the caveman
seth picks up the spear and pretends to charge adam
the kids cheer
annoyed adam takes the spear out of seths hand
this is homo neanderthalensis the neanderthal man
for over years his ancestors dominated all of europe
but then about years ago neanderthals began to disappear until one day their entire civilization was gone
greg you know what happened
tell us what happened to the caveman
well no one knows for sure
but its suspected that because neanderthal was a nomadic huntsman he roamed the land only fending for himself never learning to cohabitate with others
so as cro magnon families settled into europe they took over the land
one by one neanderthal was pushed out
and never seen or heard from again
game show voice thats quite a story
thank you adam
seth and adam look at the kids they look bored
quietly to adam you really know how to win a crowd
to the kids but you never know just cause they vanished doesnt mean theyre gone
for all we know there could be a neanderthal walking among us right now
and by the looks of this guy points at neanderthal id say he probably plays defense for the raiders
adams joke gets a small laugh from the teacher but zero response from the kids
this sucks ass
adam and seth look at each other in shock
seth chimes in i see dinosaurs
seth runs down the hall towards the dinosaur exhibit
the kids follow in excitement
the teacher barely bats an eye as she takes her time slowly trailing after the group
adam enters the hospital
adam leafs through a pamphlet on incontinence
the pedantic dr
ross enters and completely ignores adam
instead he looks over adams chart examines his mri scans and pulls out a dictaphone into the dictaphone patient has been complaining of excessive urination back pain and night sweats
blood tests and urine analysis are normal
mri indicates a massive intraduaral extradural neurofibrosarcomas extending into psoas muscle with nerve root compression syndrome and bone erosion
we see adams face gradually look more and more confused he slowly begins to raise his arm as if to ask a question
growth extends from the l to l
cytotoxic antibiotics are recommended
ross turns to see adam holding his arm in the air
i have no idea what you just said
is there something wrong with me
points to mri if you look here on your mri you see this cephalopod like object spreading down along your spinal column
it all looks the same
that is a massive schwannoma neurofibrosarcomas
i still have no idea what youre talking about
its a malignant tumor
im afraid so
how is that possible
i dont smoke
i dont drink
i eat healthy
i even recycle
well adam its actually quite fascinating
your cancer is the result of an incredibly rare gene mutation in chromosome p in the p gene that causes the growth of malignant cells in tissue around the nerves
in your case its grown along the nerves in your lower spine
adam looks at himself in the mirror
still in denial but look at me
i dont look sick
cancer often has no specific symptoms
people can go years with out knowing theyre sick
were lucky we caught it before it metastasizes
im going to put you on a month regimen of chemotherapy
its an aggressive dosage so you might want to think about taking some time off from work
this is real
adam walks to the window and presses his face against the glass
he looks down at the city below
from stories up the people on the street look like miniature figurines
adam turns back to dr
cant you just cut it out of me
yes that is an option
but because the tumor has spread to a such significant size
cutting it out now would be risky
well what are my chances of beating this
ross puts on his best act of reassurance
his words are seemingly genuine his tone is anything but
ross listen youre in good hands
the best thing for you to do right now is to not worry
let me do the worrying
ross takes a long look at adams devastated face
maybe you should talk to someone
ross hands adam a business card for the mount sinai psychology group
we have a whole department of psychologists here in the hospital
they specialize in cases
sort of matters
theyll be able to help you
not knowing what else to say dr
ross looks at his watch looks back to adam and moves to the door
hang in there champ
close on a computer screen neurofibrosarcoma schwannoma
treatment forms chemotherapy and radiation offer negligible success rates
surgical resection proven to be most effective
risks of surgery amputation of limbs
year survival rate
if tumor metastasizes systemically year survival rate
adam sits staring at the screen
this is not good
the librarian a tall blond surfer type taps adam on the shoulder
hey bro times up
adam looks up at the librarian
can i have just a few more minutes
twenty minute limit
the librarian motions to the long line of mostly homeless customers waiting to use the computer
adam sits deep in thought
the bus stops
adam gets off walks to his house and takes a deep breath
adam enters the living room its empty
npr news is on the radio
fresh paint dries on a canvas resting on an easel
the sound of someone cooking comes from the kitchen
is that you
adam walks into the kitchen
rachel is at the stove cooking in her underwear
adam stands in the doorway watching her
god she looks sexy
rachel turns in a hungarian accent welcome home mr
i made vegetarian goulash
like a ballerina rachel crosses to adam on her tip toes holding out a spoon of her goulash
she holds up the offering to adams mouth
he takes a small bite and smiles trying to hide his internal distress
his sad eyes tell rachel another story
still using accent what is wrong
still using accent liar
this is not going to be easy
we need to talk
rachel drops the accent
this seems serious
whats going on
i had a doctors appointment today
what kind of doctors appointment
adam has no idea what to say
have you ever seen the movie beaches
you mean with bette midler
yeah that one
not as good as the rose but good
remember the end of beaches
what does that have to do with you
adam just looks her in the eyes
rachel gets it
oh my god
in total shock rachel covers her mouth
i dont know
you dont know
well i do know but i cant pronounce it
neuroscharnoma or something
well how bad is it
its not good
rachel hugs adam
soaking in the comfort adam rests his head on her shoulder
she gently strokes his hair
adams hand slowly moves down rachels back
he starts kissing her neck
he knows its wrong but cant help it the only thing running through his mind is sex
after a beat rachel pulls away
begins to cry you have cancer
heart racing rachel opens the top pantry
she reaches back as far as she can and pulls out a cookie jar
she sticks her hand in the jar and pulls out an old pack of american spirits
adam looks at rachel disapprovingly
i just think its an interesting time to take up smoking again
adam im years old
rachel puts one of the cigarettes to her mouth lights it on the stove and takes a drag
what are we going to do
i dont know what to do
rachel begins compulsively pulling drags from the cigarette
adam takes the cigarette out of her hand
he goes to put it out but takes a drag instead
he then hugs rachel with one hand and opens the window with the other he proceeds to discreetly fan out the cigarette smoke
everythings going to be alright yammy
im going to start chemo in a few days
were going to get through this
they embrace in total silence
and then adam groans with the realization ugh
and my parents are coming over for dinner
do they know
adam is clearly not in the mood to see his parents
pre lap the sound of a doorbell
rachel and adam stand in front of the door
rachel opens the door
adams mother edith schwartz enters
edith is a short portly woman with thick glasses and a bright red sweatshirt bearing a cross stitched cat on it
if the borough of queens and the city of milwaukee had a child it would be edith
there they are
edith gives rachel a big hug and grabs for her left hand
i cant wait to hear the big news
art schwartz enters the house carrying a cat
due to a stroke years prior he carries a limp and is a little out of it
i found your cat playing in the neighbors yard
dad i dont have a cat
art drops the cat and it bolts out the door
so whats for dinner
everyone sits around the table
edith pokes at her plate of vegetarian goulash confused as to what shes looking at
if i had known you were coming i would have made something else
im just glad to finally be sharing a shabbat dinner with my son
looks at her plate so this isnt meat
no its called sei tan
its made of wheat gluten
edith looks more confused
but its not meat
no but it has a texture just like meat
edith reluctantly takes a small bite of the goulash
edith puts her spoon down
she pulls a handful of pills out her fanny pack and puts them in front of art
art take your pills
art picks up the pills and puts them in his mouth but doesnt swallow
as art swallows edith eagerly turns her attention to rachel
did you set a date
do not do summer like your cousin remember how awful that was
schlepping around in the heat like that
plus the bugs and the gnats
whispers to rachel what is she talking about
and now rachel
i know we havent discussed this but are you going to convert
whispers to adam she thinks were getting married
were not getting married
oh thank god
so then whats the big news that you made us rush all the way over here
not knowing how to tell his mother the upsetting news
have you ever seen terms of endearment
oh jesus adam just tell her
tell me what
but before i tell you you have to promise me youre going to stay calm
oh adam dont be so overdramatic
mom just promise me
you make me out to be some kind of irrational loon
here goes nothing
i have cancer
i have cancer
what is he saying
takes a deep breath i have cancer
what do you mean you have cancer
i dont understand
mom i have a giant tumor in my spine
edith sits motionless for what seems an eternity
the only indication that shes not dead is the movement of her index finger which twitches uncontrollably
adam sits uneasy tying to anticipate his mothers next move
edith calmly rises from of her seat and heads to the kitchen
adam follows after her
mom what are you doing
edith lights the stove and puts up a kettle of tea
im making you green tea
please will you come sit down
edith holds up the package of green tea
i saw on the today show that it reduces your risk of getting cancer by fifteen percent
mom i already have cancer
refusing to look at her son edith frantically rifles through her fanny pack
here take these
her hands now shaking uncontrollably edith hands adam a large number of prescription pills
aspirin zoloft lexapro lipitor flagel ditropan alka seltzer
mom please stop
i dont need these
just take the god damn pills
adam take ediths hand
ediths a nervous wreck frantic and hysterical
how could this happen
it must be from your fathers side of the family theyre always getting sick
your uncle bobby just got crohns
adams father looks up from his plate of goulash
thats a disorder of the bowels son
how are your bowels
the problem is not with my bowels
youre a lucky man
im moving in
adam im your mother and i need to be close to you in your time of need
thats a terrible idea
well whos going to take care of you
mom im fine
i think i have a right to take care of my son with cancer
you tell me you have cancer of the spine and now you tell me its nothing
adam looks to rachel for support
edith i cant even imagine how hard this must be for you
but i promise theres nothing for you to worry about
im going to be here every step of the way to help take good care of your son
youre a very lucky boy to be with such a good girl
you know that
you dont deserve her
adam looks at rachel and smiles
adam and seth stand on an endless line of business men and women waiting for their morning coffee
greg is at the front of that line hes taking forever to decide what he wants
adam impatiently looks at his watch
whats taking him so long
how hard is it to buy a cup of coffee
seth ignores adam as he stares at the cleavage on the woman behind him
quietly to adam look at how tight that shirt is
shes totally aware of how large her breasts look too
this morning when she got dressed she said to herself i have these things and i want the world to see them
greg looks up at the menu of endless options
what about that frozen drink whats that like
the bavarian blender
its absolute heaven
i dont know
does it have a lot of sugar
weve been here minutes
whats he shopping for a car
seths eyes are still fixed on the womans breasts
why are you in such a rush
adam looks around at all the stodgy business men all having menial conversations
is this really how you want to spend the rest of your life
wasting away in this place
greg still hasnt made up his mind
i dont believe it
why cant he just get a latte like he does every morning
we have plenty of time
no we dont have plenty of time
life is finite
what the fuck is wrong with you
i have cancer
get the fuck out of here
you have cancer
people in line look at seth
maybe a little louder you can make a special announcement
when did this happen
they found a tumor in my spine
what do you mean who
who found the tumor
lewis and clark
the doctors found it
when were you going to tell me
im telling you now
if i had cancer id tell you right away
what do you want the better friend award
its not an easy topic to bring up
seth takes a deep breath
a look of panic sweeps across his face
he quickly shakes it off
okay lets relax here
i think the best thing to do is to look on the bright side
the bright side of what
this is your chance to do all the things youve always wanted
this is it
this is your time to live it up
plus do you know how much pussy were going to get
rachel pulls her car up to the front of the hospital
adam kisses her goodbye and gets out of the car
he takes a few steps and then turns back
he gives her a nervous smile and then continues into the hospital
adam walks down the hospital corridor passing dozens of patients none of whom are under the age of
in adams hand is the business card with mount sinai psychology group written on it
he finds the office and knocks on the half opened door
the office is small cold and emotionless with stacks of psychology books and files strewn about
an attractive young woman katie sits behind a desk reading a file while she eats a rather messy sandwich
katie takes her job very seriously but has not quite mastered the art of speaking without sounding like a rigid grad student
kate looks up as she takes a bite of her sandwich
mouth full of food can i help you
i have an appointment with dr
katie puts down the sandwich rises from her seat and puts her hand out to shake adams
please call me katie
you were expecting someone else
katie wraps up her sandwich and puts the rest away
arent you supposed to be like sixty five and wear earth toned sweaters
did someone say thats what i look like
no no no
i was just expecting someone older
sorry to disappoint you
no believe me youre fine
better than fine youre dr
youre a doctor
how old are you
what are you like doogie howser
off katies blank look
the teenage doctor
does he work here
but arent you young to be a doctor
im actually in my final semester of medical school
off adams look this is a training hospital
so have you had many patients
youre actually my first
that did not help to ease adams anxiety
adam notices a dark stain on the couch
he sits as far from it as possible
katie pulls out adams file and sits in a chair across from him
adam looks anxious this is his first time in therapy
ross filled me in on your situation
tell me how have you been feeling
i feel fine
i think thats great considering what youre going through
yeah but i tend to internalize everything so who knows
you mean you repress as a coping mechanism
is that what i do
thats what you just said
the way i say it sounds cute in a neurotic way
when you say it its like an indictment
the word repress sounds so harsh
its actually quite common
oh good id hate to think im anything but an emotional sheep
dont think of it in those terms
its not like its been a conscious decision on your part
whats important now is for you to be aware of the way you treat your emotions and for me to help you make adjustments
so how do we do that
the first thing i want you to do is to stop looking at cancer as a burden
cancer has come into your life to show you that your emotional and physical bodies are out of balance
this is your chance to correct that
youre not in a cult are you
now why do you say that
i dont know it was a bad joke
but theres a reason
you chose to use humor rather than express how you really feel
katie is losing adam
in order to heal the body you must heal the mind
its imperative that you free yourself from stress and anger
get rid of all those negative emotions stored deep inside
adams mind drifts away from katie
he focuses on all the clutter
the slanted clock
the wilting plant
the crumbled paper on the floor
the mess is driving him crazy
so today what i want to do is start you on some very simple relaxation therapy
katie presses play on her ipod
we hear the soothing sounds of new agey flute music
adam looks up in confusion
i want you to lay back and close your eyes
adam looks down at the coffee stained couch
yes i want you to just lay back and let go
shouldnt we be analyzing my childhood
or my days as a call girl
oh come on
that was funny
katie stands behind adam and places her hands on his shoulders
despite the fact that this is all too strange he doesnt mind in a weird way adam is enjoying the attention
he finally lies down contorting his body so as to avoid the stain
close your eyes and relax
find a place inside yourself where you can escape the cancer
adam closes his eyes
keep your eyes closed
adam is seated at the dining table with his eyes closed
i cant believe you got me a present
is it that prada handbag ive been eyeing
what is it
keep your eyes closed
you know how i feel about surprises
last surprise i got my parents told me i was adopted
youre not adopted
yeah but sometimes i wish i was
rachel crosses into the room and stands over adam
open your eyes
adam opens his eyes to see rachel holding a tiny shih tzu wearing a pink ribbon in its hair
adam stares in confusion
what is it
its so small
what do you do with it
adam its a he and hes adorable
having a dog is supposed to help with the healing process
why did it go to medical school
i thought youd be happy
it looks like a gremlin
what happens if you get it wet after midnight
rachel looks furious
theyre a lot of work
i can barely take care of myself i dont think i can handle another living breathing needy thing in my life
i didnt realize it would be such a big deal
i can bring him back to the shelter in the morning
i know what youre doing
no youre right its not a good idea
tomorrow ill take him back where hell be kept in a tiny cage with other dogs who will bully him and rape him and then hell eventually be euthanized
the dog looks at adam
its hopeless theres no way adams going to win this one
fine we can keep the dog
rachels face lights up
she hugs adam
this is going to be so good for you
adam turns to see the dog shitting on the carpet
the sun sets over the san diego skyline
its adams going away party
draped across the entrance is a bon voyage banner with an image of a cruise ship
adam rachel and seth enter to find a crowd of mostly unfamiliar faces
phil who has had one too many vodka tonics approaches adam drink in hand

rachel gives a sympathetic smile

from across the room rachel laughs at the entire episode adam sparks a smile
adam is talking with eddie

adam with susan
brussel sprouts turnip greens asparagus celery cabbage okra honeydew melon limes green bell peppers green chiles
jenny cries hysterically as seth consoles her
i cant believe that he has cancer

ive seen him every day for the past two years and ive never once made an effort to talk to him
well im his best friend so talking to me in a way is kind of like talking to him
oh what does it matter

jenny walks away crying
seth follows after her
its not too late
adam makes himself a drink at the bar
less than excited hey greg
my uncle had what you have
man that was the worst
your uncle had schwannoma neurofibrosarcomas
yeah i think so
its the thing with the toe and the screaming and everything tastes like olives
adam looks perplexed
rachel and adam drive home from the party
theyre in completely different moods
well that was a nightmare
adam those people just threw you a party
they love you
half those people dont even know me
the car stops at a red light
rachel looks at adam
she finds his pouting adorable
he sees her staring what
i love you
i love you
rachel takes adams hand
everythings going to be okay
they look intensely into each others eyes and then kiss
adam and rachel make out as they enter the house
they make their way into the bedroom and clumsily undress one another
adam looks at rachels naked body
you are so unbelievably sexy
im totally yours suddenly theres a loud scratching at the bedroom door followed by a loud whimpering
adam continues to kiss rachel
i think he needs to go out
ill do it after
the two continue making out
the dog starts to bark
i cant do this with him barking
adam stands on the sidewalk impatiently waiting for the dog to do his business
to the dog come on
if i dont get laid tonight because of you im going to take your little bow and make a noose
the dog sniffs around trying to find the perfect spot
i need this
adams neighbor walks by with a giant mastiff
he sees adam yelling at the little shi tzu in ribbons
adam looks up
once the neighbor is out of sight will you please just finish
the dog finally finishes
adam runs back into the house
after a minute he realizes he left the dog in the street
he runs back after the dog scoops him up and then runs back inside
adam fumbles around in the dark as he tears off his clothes
he then climbs back into bed spoons rachel and begins seductively kissing her neck
he slowly moves his hand downwards
rachel takes adams hand pulls it up and clasps it tight against her chest
the two lay silently with adams arms wrapped around rachels body
want to move in
do you want me to
i was thinking it might be nice now that im not going to work anymore
and with my chemo starting
rachel turns to adam
youre here all the time anyway
rachel kisses adam and lays her head on his chest
you wanna have sex
in the morning
ediths car whizzes down the street and peels into the beth israel synagogue parking lot
the car comes to an abrupt stop as it parks in the last empty space
edith and adam step out of the car and walk feet before they realize art is still in the car
art come on
art still in the car doesnt move
edith looks at her watch and walks back to the car
edith grabs arts hand
he slowly gets out of the car
edith art and adam enter into the seat synagogue
the service led by rabbi jacobs has already begun
edith spots three empty seats all the way in the left corner of the first row
prime seats but a bitch to get to since the service has begun getting there would mean wading through a row of two dozen people
the usher approaches
please take your seats
the usher motions for edith and company to sit in the back
what about those seats up there in the front
the service has begun
my son has cancer
adams jaw tightens he cant believe his mother just did that
the usher looks at adam sizing up the situation
adam couldnt be more uncomfortable
please follow me
the usher leads the group to the front and directs the people in the front row to let them pass through
edith apologizes as each person they pass has to stand to let them by
sorry my son has cancer
adam smiles in embarrassment as he steps past
nice to see you
edith and art stand in a crowd of congregants socializing and conversing after the service
how are you
things are not well
i heard about the cancer
i cant tell you how hard its been on me
my only child
god only knows what terrible thing i did to deserve this
ive got a catatonic husband and a son with cancer
not to mention my arthritis
i dont know how ill ever get through it
as adam walks through the atrium he notices everyone whispering and pointing at him
rabbi jacobs exits the bathroom pulls up his fly and spots adam
jacobs has the face of a leather couch from all the tanning and face lifts
he spots adam
ladies and gentleman adam schwartz
how are you son
oh you know just trying to live by the covenant
dont bullshit me
you were the worst student i ever had
i bet you havent even spoken a word of hebrew since your bar mitzvah
i dont like to brag but i couldnt speak it then
your mother told me about your situation
adam looks over to see his mother surrounded by a dozen sympathetic listeners as she tells them her horror story of having a son with cancer
im sure she did
its not easy for a mother to see her son go through something like this nothing is easy for my mother
have you thought about trying to reconnect with the torah
honestly im just here to make my mother happy
it was either this or i had to go see my cousin perform in his high school theatres adaptation of youve got mail
well think about it
im always here
alan alda looks directly into the camera
the year is
hi there im alan alda
alan alda walks down the hospital corridor
so youve been told you have cancer
well youre not alone
in every people living today will experience some form of the disease
a shot of people walking in times square arrows slowly pop up over the heads of every third person
you may be wondering what is cancer
well cancer is a group of more than different diseases characterized by the abnormal growth of cells
these cells form a lump or mass called a tumor
a reddish freckle dissolves into massive tumor
cancer is treated through the use of a revolutionizing medicine called che mo therapy
shot of a very pretty woman being administered a small pill by a nurse
the woman smiles politely to the nurse
chemotherapy is a very serious treatment
shot of a doctor speaking intently to the pretty woman who listens closely
it works by destroying cancer cells unfortunately it cannot tell the difference between cancer cells and healthy cells
shot of a poorly designed diagram of the human body
a milky substance runs through the body destroying all the various cells in its path
as a result its going to make you feel tired
image of yawning kitten
shot of a school nurse checking a childs temperature
the music begins to ramp
you are about to embark on the journey of a lifetime
so aim high
shot of apollo lifting off
and always remember the road to recovery is a team effort
a shot of a girls volleyball team
one of the players serves up a pass and another spikes it down
all the girls high five
its important that you talk openly with your health care providers
ask questions so you can know all the facts
being prepared is half the battle
back on alan alda
toward helping yourself begin to feel in control again
on behalf of all the great folks at mount sinai hospital id like to thank you for your time
make it a great day
a small group of patients including adam have been watching the video
the people in the room applaud adam looks around baffled by both the video and the clapping
george a tall male nurse of bahamian descent enters the room
come with me my baby
adam follows george into the elevator where they ride down into the bowel of the hospital the cancer ward
walking through the long ominous halls of the hospital basement adam passes dozens of sick patients who are being shuttled into radiation therapy chemotherapy and other various treatment rooms
a sick fat bald elderly woman coughs as she passes
adam winces in disgust
this way my baby
george leads adam into a chemotherapy treatment room
adam is seated in a plush leather chair where hes hooked into a chemo drip
hes surrounded by a dozen gaunt hairless patients
he is the youngest patient by at least years
completely overwhelmed adam spots a bald woman sitting quietly knitting
shes at peace with herself
her zen like state helps adam relax
adam skims through a catalogue of clothing intended for cancer patients until he notices henry a very small man sitting in a wheel chair which is attached to a respirator
despite the fact that every breath henry takes looks like it might kill him he barks derogatory statements at the wall
adam looks on in terror
the genial mitch notices
is he okay
hes always like that
is that going to happen to me
best not worry about these things
alan the contentious old man sitting next to mitch chimes in
want a hit
adam looks down to see that alan is holding a one hitter full of weed
it makes it all a little easier to handle
what if someone sees us
dont be such an old man
look at this place its like death row in here they dont give a shit what we do
adam reluctantly takes a hit
how old are you
life only gets worse anyway
alan stop it
dont listen to him hes just messing with you
no im not
its all downhill from here
first your hairs going to fall out then your balls will shrink
youll marry a woman or man wholl suck every penny out of your savings and then leave you for a fitness instructor in a teal miata
then to top it all off your kids will one day stop talking to you because their therapist who you pay for tells them youre the reason theyre so fucked
youll have to excuse alan here hes going through a rough time
im just being realistic
you want some advice
dont end up a victim like the rest of em
life sucks the earlier you accept it the better off youll be
i got to tell you i was really nervous about this whole cancer thing and then i met you guys and boy do i feel better
alan and mitch laugh
i like this kid
im alan liebowitz stage lymphoma
pleased to meet you
mitch horowitz metastatic prostate cancer
adam schwartz schwannoma neurofibrosarcomas
what the fuck is that
sounds like the greek dish i had for lunch
adam is beginning to feel the effects of the weed
man this pot is really strong
good shit eh
adam stares off into space
hes really high almost like hes tripping
the walls start spinning
adam is standing on line for a roller coaster
he gets to the front of the line when the carnie stops him
what do you think youre doing
everything adam says is in german and subtitled in english
i want to ride
read the sign
the carnies points to a sign that reads no cancer
i dont have cancer
then whats that
the carnie points out adams t shirt it reads im with
adam turns around to see a giant bald fat man eating cotton candy his shirt reads cancer
adam tries to run away but hes attached to the giant fat bald guy via an umbilical cord
the giant fat bald guy reaches out picks adam up and swallows him
adam jolts out of bed
his clothes are drenched in sweat
he looks down to see rachel sleeping peacefully next to him
he quickly gets out of bed and runs into the bathroom
and by the sound of it throws up
rachel mutters something incoherent and then sprawls out consuming the entire bed
adam looks worn and exhausted from the chemo
hes never felt worse
so how do you feel after your first treatment
i feel like i was just gang raped by the buena vista social club
is everything with you going to be a joke
have you heard their horn section
adam you have a responsibility to your mind and body
i was just injected with three pints of kryptonite
can we please hold off on the new agey stuff
you cant just sit there and ignore whats happening to you
you need to stop bottling everything up
what i need is for people to stop telling me what i need
have you considered that this cancer is natures way of telling you to change the way you live your life
off adams look theres an old saying you cant change the wind but you can adjust the sails
they teach you that in medical school
katies patience is waning
i know you dont like to talk about your feelings but you have to learn to find an outlet
an outlet for what
i have cancer
and how is your body ever going to fight the stress of that cancer if you cant even handle your own emotions
adam snaps rasing his voice
well excuse me
youll have to forgive me for not having a firm handle on my emotions at this particular juncture of my life
katies a little shaken by adams outburst
she stays firm
you dont have to be here
adam knows he went too far
plus that little outburst lifted a little wight off his shoulders and he knows it
im sorry i know youre only trying to help
this is all too much for me
i dont know what to do
just tell me what to do and ill do it
katie looks at adam is he being for real
i want you to do some homework
heres a list of books on mind body therapy
they should help you get started
katie hands adam a sheet of paper with a list of books scribbled on it
adam and seth browse through shelves of books
seth is reading the authors bio from one of the books on katies list
franz schlegel is an american medical intuitive and mystic psychiatrist
schlegels teachings are widely recognized as a global spiritual awakening that is transcending individual and collective human consciousness
youre actually going to read this shit
this guy is a fucking tool
seth ditches the new age book and picks up one on mardi gras
lets go to mardi gras
why would we go to mardi gras
because its mardi gras man
its like a giant orgy of the sexiest women you can imagine all throwing themselves at you screaming to be fucked
its a fuck fest
im getting chlamydia just listening to you talk about it
we need to go see the world
this isnt my bachelor party were planning here
adam you can not let your cancer go to waste
adam takes the book from seths hands and puts it down
im not going anywhere
from across the store seth notices claire an attractive employee stacking books
well if youre not going to take advantage of your cancer then i will
seth yanks the list of books from adam and crosses to claire
yes how can i help you
im looking to buy a few books seth hands claire the list of book titles
are these for
im sorry its none of my business
no thats okay
theyre for my best friend adam
seth nods towards adam across the room
hes pretty sick
claire shoots adam a look the way one looks at a dying puppy
adam looks on in confusion
cancer not cool
i know its been really hard
claire leans in
its bad isnt it
sometimes i just wish it was me instead of him
to relieve some of the burden you know
i just want to help
adam and seth exit the bookstore
they pass claire who gives seth a big smile followed by the call me motion
what just happened
ill tell you what happened
cancer happened and you need to get on the train
adam and seth smoke a joint as they watch planet earth on a brand new flat screen tv
there are a dozen oversized boxes marked rachel scattered throughout the house
rachel yells from the bedroom
adam do you know where the dog leash is
are you going to the park again
rachel enters the room with the dog cradled in her arms
this is the third time today
he likes running around with the other dogs
he can barely make it to the door without shitting himself
rachel finds the leash and then smells the joint
are you smoking weed
since when do you smoke
rachels shocked this is way out of character for adam
you got a prescription for medicinal marijuana
no i did
whats wrong with you
rods and cones are off
rachel rolls her eyes
seth is ridiculous
then she notices the new flat screen tv on the wall and just like that her demeanor switches
she looks pissed
where did that tv come from
off rachels furious its medicinal
i thought we already agreed that my painting was going there
trying to reason why cant we put up both
you want me to put my painting next to a television
art needs to breathe adam
do whatever you want
im taking your dog to the park
and open a window
this isnt a dorm room
rachel walks to the door scoops the dog up in one arm and a bag of garbage in the other
calls out to rachel love you
the door slams
i dont get it they spend all day at the dog park
maybe shell move there
can you not talk about her like that
seth nearly chokes as he inhales
are you joking
do you see the way she treats you
shes got some kind of creative block
its her process
you have cancer for fucks sake
if i was your girlfriend id be baking you cookies and blowing you every thirty minutes
instead shes yelling at you over some fucking painting
her art sucks
you dont want to put that on your wall
it looks like someone threw up a shrimp cocktail and then used it to spackle the berlin wall
were going through a rough patch
thats what happens in relationships
shes fucking you in the ass adam
this is the one time in your life you can do whatever you want
if you want to smoke weed then smoke
you want a inch flat screen tv then get the fucking tv
and if you want to go to mardi gras then lets go to mardi gras
were not going to mardi gras
seth takes a hit from the joint and hands it back to adam
as he exhales youre totally missing my point
adam sits in katies office
ive been reading your books and you know it actually makes sense
some of it
im not gonna lie i dont really get the dark night of the soul stuff
but i get it years of anxiety have taken over my body
this is fantastic
adam is slightly taken aback by katies response
you know if youre interested there are some more advanced forms of therapy that i think could be really useful
sure if you think itll help
adam and seth are seated in a semi circle with a half dozen middle aged men and women
at the front of the group is the laughter therapist a short man with a long greying pony tail and a thick beard
all eyes are closed except for seth and adams
adams hair is noticeably thin
good morning class
before we begin id like to introduce adam and seth our two newest giggle gurus
the class laughs
adam and seth look around paranoid
quietly to adam what are they laughing at
quietly to seth just go with it
seth and adam laugh along with the others
to adam and seth now what youll soon discover is the true miracle and gift of laughter
learning to laugh at ourselves and others through non judgemental means is far more effective than any prescription drug or rehabilitation center
you see when we laugh our bodies release endorphins that not only support the immune system but also release deeply stored emotional pain and give us a fresh new outlook
the laugh therapist opens his eyes and stares intensely at adam and then seth
we dont tell jokes here we tell the truth and we laugh at that truth
the laughter therapist closes his eyes
so let us share
adam why dont you tell us what brings you here
adam looks around in fear of saying the wrong thing
were all friends here in the laughter pagoda
i ah have cancer
the entire class laughs hysterically
ah cancer yes
beverly share yesterday i confiscated my sons pornography collection and then used it to masturbate times
the class laughs
paul share my wife told me shes a lesbian
and then left me for my sister
the class laughs
i owe two men eight grand by friday
the class laughs
my best friend is a giant pussy
the class laughs
my best friends favorite band is abba
everyone laughs except for seth
when i was
i love it
time lapse adam stares at himself in the mirror
his health slowly deteriorates
hair begins to fall out
his face thins
adam alan and mitch sit in the corridor of the cancer ward
adam is wearing a ski hat to cover his balding head
camera pulls back to reveal an insanely hot woman with giant breasts in a hospital gown walk by the three men
youre both wrong
i think i know real when i see it
the hot woman scratches her head revealing that shes wearing a wig
god damn it
alan hands adam and mitch each a five dollar bill
mitch notices adam watching one of the other patients sitting and laughing with his wife
theres a longing in adams eyes
how come weve never met rachel
what the fuck
shes been really stressed lately adam looks around at all the sick people
if i brought her here shed probably freak out
save yourself the headache
dont listen to him adam
its important to be with your loved ones in times like these
women are nothing but trouble
theyre selfish animals who only add to the misery in your life
you want to talk about a cancer
listen to me adam ive been married years and its my margaret who keeps me going
mitch pulls out his wallet
he holds out a picture of his wife margaret
shes my reason to live
thats precious mitch i almost want to wrap it up and tie a little bow around it
honestly i dont give a shit
you can do whatever you want
its your life
all i know is that im not going to spend my last days on this miserable planet pining over a woman
the day my wife left me was the best day of my life
adam lets this soak in
adams on his cell phone pacing in front of the hospital
hey its rachel
i must be doing something really important
ill give you a call when im done
hey its me just checking to see if youre on your way
adam paces impatiently
he calls rachel again it goes straight to voice mail
hey its rachel
i must be doing something really important
ill give you a call when im done
its me again
just checking to see where you are
in case youre looking for me im now on the other side of the parking lot
as katie walks to her car she sees adam pacing and mumbling to himself
what are you doing
just waiting for rachel to pick me up
what time is she coming
katie looks at her watch
its six thirty
she must be stuck in traffic
you want a ride
adam is seated in the front seat as katie drives
the car is filthy its littered with papers magazines food wrappers etc
katies body is pressed all the way up against the steering wheel with her eyes fixed on the road
sorry about the mess
adam picks up a copy of organizing your way to success which is lying on the floor
i think you should ask for a refund
i know i know
what can i say
im not good at getting rid of things
i get easily attached
yeah i can see
changing the subject
so you dont drive
but you have a license
i actually failed my test
but i thought you can re take the test
lets just say that the state of california felt it was best i didnt
katie stares at adam in shock
what did you do
i kind of backed my moms car down an embankment
into the balboa cactus garden
the garden with all the endangered plants
they didnt want to tow it out in fear of destroying more of the vegetation so they had to use a giant crane
katie lets out a tiny chuckle but quickly contains herself
unable to hold back katie continues laughing
this is the first time weve seen katie let go of her rigid nature
stop the car
katie looks at adam nervously
why whats wrong
just stop the car
katie stops the car
adam grabs a handful of katies garbage and gets out
what are you doing
i cant handle all this mess
adam tosses the garbage in a dumpster and comes back to the car for more
katie starts laughing she cant believe adam is cleaning her car
wait no not that thats my dinner
adam leaves katies dinner and throws out the rest of the garbage
he gets back in the car and takes a deep breath
you can drive
adam and katie arrive at adams house
thanks for the ride
adam looks at his house
the lights are out
hes really not in the mood to be alone
he looks back at katie
do you want to come in
for a beverage
it probably wouldnt be very professional of me
come on ill let you analyze my id
katie is hesitant but she also feels in a strange way that adam is more than a patient
but i cant stay long
adam and katie sit on the couch playing an ultra violent video game
katie is destroying adam
you know you are terrible at this
adam is totally lost
he has zero sense of how to play
ive never played before
this is your playstation
doesnt mean i play it
games these days today are so complicated
theres too many buttons
i cant keep track of what does what
perhaps youd prefer something a little more simple
maybe a nice game of connect four or bingo
she has a sense of humor
katies face lights up
shes proud of herself for that one
duck hunt now that was a game
you know why
you think im kidding
my dad and i used to have duck hunt tournaments
he was actually really good
until he had his stroke
that must have been hard seeing him lose his cognitive skills like that
this is the most emotionally honest weve ever seen adam
well the funny thing is that the stroke actually made him a better player he just lost interest
katie feels for adam
youve never talked about your dad
well whose fault is that
the two continue to play
adam wildly pushes every button as katies character pins adams character and repeatedly slams his head into the ground
katie pats adam on the shoulder
adam holds out a tray of wheat grass as he prepares to blend wheat grass shots
you ever had this stuff
no but its supposed to be really good for you
well it smells like my grandmother
you complain a lot
you havent met my mother
its a miracle i do anything but complain
i try not to look at the world like that
the world would be a boring place if we didnt complain
theres got to be something
one thing just one thing that drives you nuts
i really dont like it when people at work finish all the coffee and dont refill the pot
its infuriating right
i wouldnt say infuriating
its just not good work place etiquette
adam is far more excited by this revelation
he hands katie a shot of wheat grass and takes one last sniff of the awful smelling drink
he raises his glass to make a toast
adam downs the drink and cringes at the taste
katie follows and in total disgust she spits her wheat grass all over adams face
oh god thats disgusting
im so sorry
katie grabs a towel as adam stands speechless
im so sorry
adam keeps his eyes closed as katie wipes his face
is it all gone
for the first time katie notices how cute adam is
adam opens his eyes to catch katie staring at him
they lock eyes for a moment
uncomfortable adam averts his look
suddenly rachel walks through the front door
feeling a little foolish katie motions to leave
i should probably be going
rachel enters the kitchen
where have you been
i hope im not interrupting
oh this is dr
mcrae my therapist
this is your therapist
please call me katie
what are you doing here
she drove me home
ring a bell
thank you so much for doing that
lifes been a little crazy lately which im sure adam has told you all about
i love those shoes
the tension is thick
im going to go
ill see you at our next session adam
where have you been
i was at the gallery
you were supposed to pick me up
i totally spaced
with the opening only three months away my heads just all over the place
off adams look
dont look at me like that
you know this is a hard time for me
let me go back and talk to the doctor see if maybe they can diagnose me with something that better suits your needs
im not just some car service here to shuttle you around
and my house isnt a summer camp
you cant just come and go as you please and not take some responsibility
and what is it that im not taking responsibility for
i cant handle this
you make it sound like im your wife
you know what i thought the other day
that i might actually die without ever having sex again
im sorry if your cancer isnt turning me on
rachel begins to cry
you think this is easy for me seeing you sick like this
the past few months have been hard on me too
its not always about you
adam tenderly wraps his arms around rachel
why are you so good
youre my yam
rachel stares at adam as he sleeps next to her in bed
she slowly moves her index finger along adams arm and then seductively kisses his neck
adam firmly grabs hold of rachel and the two begin to go through the motions
clothes come off
adam gets on top of rachel
and then stops
adam looks down
i dont know whats wrong
it wont work
adam rolls over onto his back
he and rachel lay silent neither making contact with the other
adam sits down next to mitch but notices theres no alan
speechless mitch looks up at adam and slowly shakes his head
tears roll down mitchs cheek
adams face goes white
adam and mitch stand next to the rabbi
the tombstone reads alan liebowitz finally
the camera tilts up to the sky and then down to reveal a healthy adam is surrounded by dozens of energetic elderly people who are swimming playing bocci ball shuffle
board bridge etc
adam looks on in confusion as an old man wearing an official looking badge drives by on a golf cart
the old man stops his cart
how can i help you
where am i
the after life
this is heaven
the old man scratches his balls
pretty great huh
theyve even got a frozen yogurt machine
the old man points to a long line of excited seniors awaiting their turn at a massive frozen yogurt sundae bar
a sign in front reads wait minutes
there are lines in heaven
its worth it
adam jumps from bed in cold sweat
adam is seated in the rabbis office he looks despondent
so you want to know whats going to happen when you die
i think its a fair question
fair yes but impossible for me to answer
our deaths like our lives have meaning and are all part of gods plan
how should i know what god has planned for you
maybe if you came to service once in a while
well am i going to go to heaven
what if i want to just die
thats like buying a ticket for a cruise and then not going
the afterlife is where the fun begins
how can being stuck in some nonexistent void with my grandparents be fun
i spent my entire life trying to get away from my family now im going to have to spend an eternity with them
adam you can not look at death as a curse
even in death we are all still part of god
life on earth is just the beginning
but thats not what i want
then find another religion
i dont make the rules
adam is lying on the couch staring at the ceiling
there is total silence
youre being awfully quiet today
is everything okay
im going to die arent i
what are you talking about
we dont know that
adam sits up and looks at katie
im not getting any better
dont say that youre doing so well
did you know that they found a quasar billion light years away
billion light years
its more than billion years older than our planet and were just seeing it now and you think im going to live
what are you talking about
cancer is an epidemic
it killed alan its going to kill me and its going to kill millions more after me
theres nothing anybody can do
this is really good adam
let it out
will you stop
i cant do this anymore
it doesnt matter
none of it
im going to die and with nothing to show for my life
years from now my legacy be will be that of just another person dead of cancer
this helplessness youre feeling is normal
these emotions youre holding onto are what make you human
but it doesnt mean you can just stop living your life
look at how youve grown over the past few months you cant just throw it all away
talk to me
i know youre only trying to help but this isnt working for me anymore
katie is left feeling as though she failed
adam lies on the bed of an mri machine
his body is slowly drawn into the enclosed body scanner
time lapse adams stares at himself in the mirror
his health deteriorates even more
looking at himself in the mirror adam takes note of his hollow cheeks and worn eyes
he looks awful like an old man
there isnt any youth left
hes not getting any better and he knows it
noticing a few renegade hairs sticking up adam pulls out a lint brush and combs his head
rachel enters and steps up on the scale
she examines herself in the mirror
i need a new lint brush
okay ill pick one up
and i have a doctors appointment next thursday
the big one
rachel continues to examines her waist
am i getting fat
adam stares at rachel
are you listening to me
so youll take me
in frustration adam weakly picks up the scale and throws it against the wall smashing it
adam sits alone in his empty house
its a mess
he looks unhinged
he slowly pulls a hit from a joint as he watches matlock on his flat screen tv which has been moved to the floor to make room for rachels painting
adam flips the channel to martha stewart then to i love lucy then to general hospital then to body building on espn
he turns the tv off
adam crosses to the answering machine
it reads messages
he presses play
all the messages are from his mother
he hits delete
adam reads through a stack of unopened letters
he comes across a postcard from the museum advertising mountain dew presents the origins of man
close on the mountain dew presents the origins of man poster in the museums main entrance
adam enters the museum and walks up to the sign
people stop and stare stunned by adams gaunt appearance like a ghost haunting the grounds
adam carries a wide smile hes overcome with a sense of nostalgia for his old job
phil and adam sit in phils office
you look great
yeah look at you
i want to come back to work
you want to come back
whats so crazy about that
you could be anywhere right now and this is that place
are you sure thats a good idea
phil is treading a fine line
your current health
you said i look great
yeah for a guy with cancer
adam looks dejected
phil feels bad he went too far
alright what the hell
id love to have you back
lets be honest this place is falling apart without you
thank you phil
so youre really okay
i mean the cancer is oh its really good
weve come to an understanding
it takes whatever it wants and depletes me of my every will to live and i let it
phil second guessing his decision welcome back
seth leads a tour of foreign tourists through the museum
he speaks as he did earlier like a game show host
and if you look over on your left youll see our newest exhibit the last days pompeii
buried in ad by the catastrophic eruption of mt
vesuvius pompeii remained hidden and forgotten until when archeologists began to excavate the site
here we see exquisitely preserved objects that offer a glimpse into the day to day life of this ancient city
seth comes upon adam who is working closely on a diorama
this here is adam one of our curators
adam do you want to tell us what youre working on
this here is a depiction of what pompeiis final hours probably looked like
adams exhibit is a highly morbid depiction of pompeiis final hours
the scene is total chaos
ash flies through the air
hot molten lava engulfs the town
miniature men women and children run through the streets in horror
people are sacrificing whatever they can for the gods
theres a wild orgy in the streets
and a giant tyrannosaurs rex model devours a villager
according to pliny the younger you could hear women lamenting children crying men shouting
there were some so afraid of death that they prayed for death
many raised their hands to the gods and even more believed that there were no gods any longer and that this was one unending night for the world
the tourists take pictures
in shock seth quickly shuttles the group away
moving along we see the beautiful watercolor paintings of john james audobon
seth looks back at adam like hes lost his mind
the sound of someone vomiting can be heard booming from the mens bathroom
a crowd of museum guests walk past in horror
they look at each other in fear
the toilet flushes
adam walks out
adam smiles in embarrassment
ill be in pompeii if anyone needs me
adam walks back to the pompeii exhibit
you feeling okay
you dont look so good
could be worse
phil notices the pompeii exhibit
phil feels terrible about what hes going to say next
i dont know how to say this
phil places a comforting hand on adams shoulder
i get it
youre a good guy
come back when youre better
you know youll always have a home here
distraught adam walks down the hall of evolution
slouched in defeat he passes the various dioramas depicting human evolution
he begins at modern humans and walks backwards in time
he comes to the family of cro magnons then neanderthal man
he stops and looks at neanderthal their slumped profiles match
he continues down the hall towards the exit
adam walks along the boardwalk
hes surrounded by perfection
the blue sky
hundreds of beautiful men and women in their s and s jogging biking surfing skate boarding playing volleyball etc
he looks like a raisin among grapes
adam stands impatiently on his porch
he looks at his watch and then dials his phone
hey its rachel
i must be doing something really important
ill give you a call when im done
adams face is red with fury
he does his best to hold back
hey its adam
where are you
maybe you forgot but my appointment is today
so call me back
enraged adam hangs up
adam picks up his phone and dials again
hey man i need you to do me not around
leave a message
adam hangs up and dials again
hello adam holds the phone away from his ear and cringes
a pang of regret runs through his body
edith art and adam sit in the exam room each reading their respective magazines minus art who is lost somewhere in his own world
the tension is thick
edith looks at her watch and shivers
theres a knock at the door
a cute nurse enters
the doctor wanted me to apologize for running late hes just in with another patient but should be out in a few minutes
you guys holding up alright
its very cold in here
is there anyway you can turn down the air conditioning
unfortunately the temperature is controlled by a central thermostat
my son has cancer
im sorry really if i could i would but theres nothing i can do
adams pissed that his mother has just involved him
smiles to the nurse dont worry about it
scowls at edith im fine
are you sure
i could get you a blanket
no really im okay
but thank you
id love a blanket
to the cute nurse were fine
okay but you let me know if you need anything
the nurse smiles at adam in sympathy he smiles back
the cute nurse exits
re the cute nurse i dont like her
edith puts her hand on adams forehead
he looks at her hand and then picks up a magazine in an attempt to ignore her
you feel warm
edith pulls some pills out her fanny pack
youre like some kind of deranged pusher
do you know what its like to fear losing your son
when you have children of your own we can discuss it
now take the pills
adam puts the pills in his mouth and pretends to swallow
edith gets up from her chair
as soon as his mother turns away adam spits the pills into his hand
edith paces around the room looking at the doctors various degrees on the wall
adam looks on annoyed at every step his mother takes
edith closes in on one of the degrees and puts on her reading glasses for further examination
its nothing he went to a state college
i just worry that youre not getting the best care possible
adam cant take it anymore
well who needs a doctor when theyve got you and your fanny pack
you can be a little shit sometimes you know that
you think i dont know whats best for you
i birthed you
you came out of me
i am your mother for better or for worse so accept it
re fanny pack you dont like this well im sorry
its my own way of caring
youre driving me crazy
with the comments and the pills every five minutes
im not dad
i can take care of myself
edith turns away adams words hurt
im sorry i didnt mean it
edith blows her nose as tears rolls down her cheek
yes you did
i drive you crazy
adam gently puts his hand on ediths shoulder
edith turns to adam helpless and scared
youre all ive got
look at your father
we see art sitting in the chair picking his nose
ive lost him
my true love gone
im never going see him again at least not in this life
he spent his whole life priding himself on his independence always too stubborn to ask for help and now look at the son of a bitch
you like shitting yourself
he was the greatest thing to ever happen to me
and then i had you and that was even greater
so if i hover and threaten your independence so what
you have a mother who loves you more than anything
is that so awful
adam and edith share a moment
ross storms in the room carrying a stack of mri films
he seems rushed
sorry to keep you folks waiting
its been one of those days
car got towed
wife double parked it
adam and edith look at dr ross with blank stares
anyway ill cut to the chase
the cancers not responding to the chemo
ross places the mri into the light box
as you can see
the tumor is continuing to grow here along the nerve
adam and edith squint to see what ross is talking about but see nothing
so what do we do
we need to operate
if we dont remove it soon we risk metastasis
but you said surgery was too risky
were out of options
tears roll down ediths cheek
adam grabs hold of her hand
but hes going to be okay right
youre going to fix it
ross sits he knows this cant be easy for a mother
this surgery is no guarantee
the risks are tremendous
and even if were able to remove the tumor theres still the chance that adam youll never be able to walk again
adam looks at his mother
he firmly grabs hold of her hand
does that mean
i can get handicap parking
adams line breaks the tension forcing a slight smile across ediths face
distraught and emotionally worn adam enters to discover the smell of a home cooked meal
he walks through the house
he stands in the doorway of the kitchen staring at rachel cooking
rachel turns around
shes in high spirits
rachel gleefully skips over and gives adam a sweet kiss on the cheek
the girls and i are having a movie night
i somehow got suckered into cooking
off adams look dont worry i left you some
adam feigns a smile hiding the pain of his heart breaking in a thousand pieces
suddenly rachels iphone vibrates
she picks it up and reads her text message
her face lights up as she reads
she quickly types a reply
she wants to know what time im coming over
even more suspicious thats what she just texted
she wants to know what time youre going over to her house
rachel puts the phone down on the counter and returns to her cooking
alright well im gonna go lie down
i might be out late so dont wait up
adam walks to the bedroom
after a beat he moves back to the doorway and pops his head around the corner
he quietly watches rachel cross from the kitchen into the living room
he stealthily steps into the kitchen picks rachels iphone off the counter and scrolls through her text messages
what the fuck
rachel enters the kitchen
what are you doing
my art partner
re text message he wants to know if youre still coming over tonight
should i tell him youre having a girls night
oh wait you already told him to bring the wine
it seems as though youve double booked yourself
i cant believe you just invaded my privacy like that
oh you just got another text from him
he says your skin is the canvas upon which my dreams are painted
rachel reaches for the phone
adam pulls away
give me back my phone
hope youre not too sore from this afternoon
he seems sweet
adam its not what you think
well now how do you know what im thinking
dont be like that
i didnt do anything wrong
youve been cheating on me
adam youre being ridiculous
adam holds up rachels phone to display a photo of rachel naked covered in red paint
adam scrolls through an entire series of nude photos of rachel all ridiculously artistic
there are over a dozen naked photos of you in here
suddenly the back door swings open
oblivious seth enters
adam and rachel say nothing
seth can tell he just walked into some major shit
adam and rachel say nothing
seth takes a peak at rachels iphone
now that i would put on the wall
off adams look i can see youre in the middle of something
ill just be in the other room
seth crosses to the living room
rachel picks up the conversation where they left off
its a portrait series commenting on post colonial patriarchy in the congo
off adams look thats it
have you lost your mind
i had the most important appointment of my life today and you missed it because you were off with your art partner
and what the fuck do you know about africa
rachel totally forgot about his appointment
the guilt runs through her body
please adam im so sorry
what did the doctor say
did you cheat on me
tell me what the doctor said
like a child being scolded rachels face says it all
are you going to break up with me
im going to pretend you never existed
i dont want to break up
you know you have a pretty fucked up way of showing your commitment
i told you i couldnt handle this
rachel stares at adam with her adorable green eyes
she takes his hand
i love you
adam lets go
he looks rachel in the eyes
i want you out my house
adam walks out the back door
seth enters the kitchen and gets in rachels face
he stares her down
shame on you
seth exits out the back door
adam and seth sit on the bow of a docked sail boat
the two have had a lot to drink
adam is understandably upset
your skin is the canvas upon which my dreams are painted
is dreams a metaphor for seth makes a masturbating motion with his hand
you remember the last time we came out here
how could i forget
jen zabrowski went down on me right where youre sitting
that memory is so far from me jen giving me a blow job
no prom night
it feels like a lifetime ago
i know it happened but thats it
its like someone elses memory
adam stares out at the ocean
adam throws his beer bottle into the ocean
i cant believe this is all actually happening
the girl or the cancer
its some pretty fucked up shit
you know i used to think that i was actually going to spend the rest of my life with rachel
granted that might not be so far off
shakes his head what a waste
seth puts his arm around him
we need to get you laid
dont you ever give up
seriously whos going to have sex with me
some girls are into it
i look like powder
plus i have erectile dysfunction
then lets go get me laid
seth stands and then stumbles
hes really drunk
i think i should drive
you dont have a license
do you even know how to drive
how hard can it be
hard enough that you dont have a license
this might be my last chance
you care about driving
we could be on everest getting high on ayahuasca with sherpas and you want to drive
forget it i give up
the two get off the boat and climb into seths car
adam puts the key in the ignition
without checking the mirrors he backs the car up
boom the car slams into a giant statue of neptune riding a sea horse
hey miss daisy will you please watch where your going
i didnt see it
thats what the mirrors are for
adam pulls out of the parking lot
i know what im doing
adam turns left onto a one way street
its the wrong way
youre going the an oncoming car honks and swerves out of the way only nearly avoiding a head on collision
turn the car around
im driving and i want to go this way
another car swerves out of the way
what the fuck is wrong with you
for once can you just shut up and let me do this
so im driving the wrong way
big fucking deal
seth pulls the emergency brake
the car stops abruptly
youre an idiot
this is my car
adam looks like hes about to erupt
seth looks at adam speechless and then gets out of the car
youre being a real douche
adam locks the doors and sits quietly for a moment
he then proceeds scream at the top of his lungs
years worth of suppressed emotions come out
adam pulls out his cell phone
he tries to open the door
adam open the door
adam ignores seth and begins to dial
dont you dare call her
not after everything shes done to you
adam gives seth the finger
youre a pussy
well youre a selfish piece of shit who cares more about getting his dick wet than actually being a friend
seth looks hurt
adam holds the phone up to his head
the phone rings
a dark figure in bed sits up and turns on the bedside lamp
its not rachel its katie
i dont want to die
katie sits up
shes awake now
im years old and ive never even been to canada
i havent lived my life
im really really scared
im sorry for the way i acted
i should have never stormed out like that
it was wrong of me to push you the way i did
i wasnt listening
i could never have handled all of this the way you have
you mean like a complete asshole
and then silence she really cares about him
i think youre really brave
if i dont die i think we should go on a date
adam im not sure if thats a good idea
not only am i your therapist but youre also my first patient ever
what kind of precedent would i be setting
it makes for a nice incentive
i cant date you
yes you can
no i cant
yes you can
no i cant
a wise person once told me you cant change the wind but you can adjust the sails
adam i cant date you
thats what you think
suddenly adam passes out
his head slams into the steering wheel
the horn blares
seth and adam stagger into the building
adam and seth enter the dingy studio apartment it looks like it hasnt been cleaned in years
adam scoops up some dust with his finger
seth is unusually quiet
both guys are being distant
seth pulls down the murphy bed and the two awkwardly avoid eye contact as they undress
adam climbs into bed
he notices a book called coping with your loved ones cancer on seths bedside table
the book is worn and has multiple book marks indicating its been read
adam looks at seth he had him pegged all wrong
seth claps his hands
the lights turn off
lying in bed adam hears a strange noise he tilts his head to the side to see seth breathing heavily and staring at him
what are you doing
watching you sleep
its a little creepy
i cant help it
seth lays back on his pillow and holds onto adams hand
they both stare up at the ceiling terrified about the future
seths car enters the mall parking lot and parks
you have new messages
hi adam this is richard mathesson your familys estate lawyer
your mother asked me to call
we need to talk about potential ah well just call me there are some potential arrangements we need to work out
adam and seth browse through racks of mens suits
adam comes upon one he likes
the sales clerk approaches
sir can i help you with anything today
holds up suit you think this is a good suit to wear to your own funeral
no what you want is on level
seths car drives up the long driveway of the cemetery
adam this is dr
good news i was able to expedite the wait for your surgery
your scheduled for tomorrow morning at am with dr
please call my office if you have any questions
a mortician stout and dignified with a slight british accent leads adam and seth on a tour of the cemetery grounds
here at linden were more than just a stopping ground for the deceased
we understand that life is different for everyone and helping families to see their loved ones off to the hereafter means approaching every funeral and burial with its own dignity
a funeral is a representation of the individuals time spent on earth so i ask you to reflect on your inevitable interment and think carefully in choosing the service and
tomb that best befits you
what about a viking funeral
im not familiar
talking out of his ass you know we put him on a boat
cover it with
whatever you can find
we push it out
into the sea
or the ocean
and then shoot flaming arrows boom
it catches on fire
and thats it
the mortician stops and looks at seth
hes not even going to dignify seth with a reply
points to grave plot here you are the schwartz family plot
adam and seth look at the rows of schwartz family tombstones
up front is an empty gap presumably where adam and his parents are to go
adam and seth stare at the graves as we adam lies on a gurney
lamb the neurosurgeon performing adams surgery enters
hes wired on espresso
behind him is nurse wong who looks like shed rather be anywhere else
good morning adam how are you feeling
lambs already thick glasses he holds adams medical chart right up to his to his face
so were going to be removing your kidney
or is it the left
thats doctor humor
adam forces a small chuckle
hes completely terrified
nurse wong here needs you to sign a few papers so im going to leave her to do her job and ill see you after the surgery
nurse wong hands adam a giant pile of disclaimers to sign
what is all this
hospital liability and disclaimer forms
in case they need to fuse your spine or remove any organs
you know the usual
glad to hear theres nothing unusual about removing organs
adam signs the documents and hands them back to nurse wong
you have some visitors
as nurse wong exits edith and art enter
there he is
edith pulls a strip of pills out of her fanny pack
she hands them to adam like shes slipping him illegal drugs
here take these
i got them from canada
adam looks closely at the pills they read nuprin
mom this is nuprin
i know isnt it great
adam looks at his mother perplexed by her logic
what the hell
adam downs the pills
art whispers closely into his ear
i gotta new coat
thats great dad
adam sticks his hand inside the pocket of arts coat
i am feeling
art grabs hold of adams hand and stares at his son
i love you son
i love you too dad
katie knocks on the door
katie slowly enters holding a bouquet of flowers
edith examines her
this is too awkward
adam nods for his mother to leave
come on art lets go to the waiting room
on her way out edith turns to katie and notices a cross around her neck
edith and art exit
adam is left alone with katie
theyre both nervous
i brought you flowers
not sure why i didnt know what else theyre great thank you
katie sits on the bed next to adam
so how you doing
im a little freaked out
a small german anesthesiologist enters
there is something incredibly unsettling about her thick accent
hello adam i am the anesthesiologist
i will give you shot to make you sleep
adam holds katies hand
will you be here when i wake up
im not going anywhere
now relax this will take a few minutes to feel the effect
the anesthesiologist injects the drugs into adams iv
about how long
relax you will soon begin the sleeping
well what if it doesnt work
how do you know i wont wake in the middle of the surgery
what if i just like that adams out cold
adam is face down on the operating table
two neurosurgeons dr
lamb and dr
henry are in mid surgery
alongside the two doctors are nurse wong and nurse scott
im telling you sir francis drake was a buccaneer
no he was a privateer
i thought he was a pirate
a pirate works for no one but himself
a privateer has a mandate from a government
i thought that was a buccaneer
no a buccaneer is a butcher turned pirate
then whats a mercenary
will you google it
standing to the side of the operating table is the group of med students from earlier
theyre still taking notes
edith art and seth sit impatiently watching the clock
katie paces up and down the hall
hours go by
time cant seem to go by quick enough
lamb finds edith katie and seth in the waiting room
we were successful in the extraction of the tumor
however as you can imagine with something of this magnitude
there were some unforeseen complications
the bone corrosion was much greater than initially anticipated
we had to remove part of the hip and pelvis as well as most of the psoas muscle
we also had to remove a good amount of sheath tissue around the sciatic nerve the damage to that nerve is considerable which is going to hinder his ability to
hes in stable condition right now but its touch and go
adams in his hospital bed still asleep from the surgery
a nurse comes in to change his iv
adam slowly awakens
he is high on morphine
he stares mesmerized by the nurse
that is the most beautiful dresses
where did you get it
adam i see youre awake
how are you feeling
i feel wonderful
that would be the morphine
lamb picks up a handle thats attached to the morphine drip and sticks it in adams hand
i want you to push this little button any time you feel pain
itll trigger the morphine
you think you can do that
adam moves his hands really slowly in the air magic
art and edith enter the room
adam reacts like a little kid being picked up from pre school
my little boy
remember the time you walked in on me masturbating
that was so awkward
what hotel is this
we need to go on more vacations
katie pops her head out from behind adams parents
youre here too
youre soooooo awesome
katie mcrae katie mcrae katie mcrae
mic rae dr
awesome mic rae
id love to make you pancakes sometime
suddenly the most excruciating pain runs through adams body causing him to scream in agony
squeeze the morphine trigger
adam squeezes the trigger
the morphine offers immediate relief
he lays back in total bliss and then
a door bell
a hand reaches out
a finger on that hand pushes the door bell
the other hand holds a bouquet of flowers
the hand belongs to mitchs wife margaret
she stands on the porch of a small beach bungalow
the front door opens
margaret looks straight ahead
she then looks down startled by adam in a wheelchair
oh hello i didnt see you ah down there
theres a glow in adams face he looks younger and more jovial than weve ever seen
you must be margaret
yes im looking for adam schwartz
face lights up youre adam
the way mitch described you i always assumed you to be much older
about years older
but youre just a baby
im so glad you could make it
im really sorry about mitch
please come inside
youre just in time
adam leads margaret inside past a dozen oversized boxes
sorry about the mess
i just moved in
the ocean air is supposed to be good for my recovery
adam and margaret enter the living room
everyones there edith art katie and seth
seth and katie are playing a video game duck hunt
edith sets food on the table
were having a duck hunt tournament
oh i dont know how to play video games
adam holds up the controller an old nintendo gun
its really easy
one button does everything
edith chimes in from across the room
this foods not going to eat itself
everyone makes their way to the table
visibly weak adam slowly lifts himself out of the wheelchair
he yelps in pain
katie starts to help when seth intervenes
i got it
seth grabs hold of adam and with his help adam takes a small step and then lowers himself into his seat at the table
katie places a pillow behind adams back
adam takes katies hand she looks down at him they exchange a smile
adam notices and open window
seth ignores adam as he fills both their plates with food
i think theres a red tide or something
my eyes are all itchy
it feels like someone is rubbing sandpaper on my corneas
as he serves adam nope
you dont have cancer anymore
no more special treatment
i am still in remission
you gonna spend the rest of your life complaining
i like complaining
we freeze on the family sitting around the dinner table
