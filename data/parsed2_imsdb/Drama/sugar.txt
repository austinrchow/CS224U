written by anna boden ryan fleck a high angle looking out over a well manicured baseball field carved out of a tropical jungle
a game is currently in progress
wearing kansas city knights uniforms mostly black and dark skinned dominicans as well as several lighter skinned venezuelans years old are set in their positions poised for the next pitch
close on the pitcher miguel santos aka azucar sugar lean black and handsome
sweat drips down his face in the oppressive midday heat
he steadies his glove and ball at his chest peeking over at the runner on first base
miguel lifts his leg high into the air rears back his right arm and fires the ball toward the plate
a cloud of dust pops off the catchers mitt as the ball slams inside
the batter lowers his head helpless in the face of miguels overpowering fastball
from the dugout miguels teammates cheer him on
head coach reyes dark skinned s nods approvingly claps
behind the homeplate backstop a dozen rookie players also in kansas city uniforms cheer for their team
two young players clocking miguels pitches look at each others radar guns which read and mph
as the next batter steps up to the plate miguels catcher jose taps his index finger on his thigh calling for an outside fastball
the next pitch is popped up on the infield between first and home
miguel locates the ball points to the sky but jose and first baseman pedro berroa nearly collide as the ball lands between them and the runners reach base safely
b from the observation tower the academys director leandro b alvarez light skinned late s and several other coaches and scouts jot down notes on their clipboards

c on the field miguel glares at pedro who averts his eyes and c kicks the dirt
miguel looks in for the sign from jose nods and delivers a tight fastball that sends the batter stumbling backwards to the dirt
some players laugh and heckle the batter
others point angry fingers at miguel who greets the batter back to the plate with a friendly but authoritative grin
he sends in the next pitch and the batter swings right through it getting nothing but air
the team about young men gather around several tables for their standard baked chicken and rice lunch
the mood is friendly and playful as players tease each other across the tables
miguel sitting with his friends marcos nd base and alfonso rd base works on a second helping of dessert
check out sugar
puts on twenty pounds in two months now hes going for twenty more
mouth full of food all muscle baby
for some new players distinguishable in the sea of blue uniforms by their black tryout jerseys and ragged sneakers it is their first healthy meal and they eat as if
it were their last
one of them salvador black scrawny holds his plate up to his mouth shovelling food down his throat
slow down kid it aint going nowhere
a few of the guys laugh
to pedro if you hustled half as much as him maybe youd be hungry too
the other guys ohhhh miguels insult as salvador and miguel exchange subtle grins
official shooting script as of
kids crowd around in a circle repeating after the animated english instructor senor sanchez who goes over some english baseball terms in the center
as he repeats the terms he enthusiastically pantomimes the meanings of each
close on miguel repeating the strange words
its dark and most of the team sits around an old tv set watching the climactic final scene of field of dreams dubbed in spanish
kevin costner asks his father to play catch in a voice that sounds nothing like kevin costner
miguel passes through the room and we follow him out of the rec room down a hall and into
where he sits down at the bench press lowers his head in thought
track in close as he crosses himself mouths a prayer then leans back onto the bench
track out as he lifts the bar and begins a set of presses
official shooting script as of
the kansas city director of minor league operations rudy hubbard white s watches a tryout session where two skinny teens in worn street clothes pitch to uniformed catchers
their agent talks on a cell phone nearby
alvarez the academy director approaches one of the kids whispers in his ear
the kid smiles tentatively
alvarez joins rudy and they speak in english
whatd you tell him
i told him to grip the ball more gently
like a tit
they both crack up
from the tryout mound
the kid looks over to the two men pow wowing about him
he breathes in nervous
pedro sweating hard takes a few cuts but only seems to be hitting weak ground balls and foul tips
hasnt developed like we hoped
how much he sign for
these kids keep getting more expensive
how much did you sign for back in the day
when i was fifteen
rudy smiles and moves on
pedro watches the men as they walk away
alvarez and rudy approach a pitching coach instructing salvador
miguel warms up next to him
official shooting script as of

miguel nods nervous focuses
the ball curves very subtly over the plate for a strike
mind if i try something
official shooting script as of
miguel looks back to the men
hey kid do you mind
miguel stares blankly at rudy not understanding
in spanish give him the ball
miguel hands rudy the ball and rudy demonstrates how to handle a knuckle curve ball which looks strangely unorthodox with the index finger tucked against the baseball
gives you more rotation more movement
hands miguel the ball you try
miguel struggles to emulate rudys grip so rudy maneuvers his fingers into the correct position
miguel looks over to his catcher jose
winds up the next pitch and soars it feet wide of the mark
rudy and alvarez laugh
miguel looks back over his shoulder
its okay son these things take time
youll figure it out
rudy pats miguel on the back and walks off with alvarez
miguel stares at them hard as they go
he turns back to his catcher determined squeezes the ball in spike curve formation
misses badly again
jump cuts take us through a half dozen more bad curve attempts as other players take notice and gather around some laughing until
finally a perfect curve twists dramatically through the air landing centered in joses mitt
the other players erupt in amazement while miguel stares straight ahead
after a beat he smiles wide
official shooting script as of
sanchez stands in front of a chalkboard reading off lines of a scripted english dialogue for the class to repeat
the class version of the words are jumbled and incomprehensible
i want to talk to you

what is the problem
your performance in the mound is not good as last year
what is problem

close on miguel focused on the baseball in his hand
he practices his knuckle curve grip not participating in the lesson
i want to give you a chance
