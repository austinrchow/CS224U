a cold dawn
two black town cars sit side by side facing a view of a farming valley below
two men in dark suits and long coats stand near the cars casually on the lookout
if we caught a glimpse underneath the coat of the taller of the two wed see that he was carrying a mm
in the backseat of the car sit hamersley and reynolds each well kept and in his early s
i know thy works and thy labour and how thou canst not bear them that are evil
and thou hast tried them who say they are apostles and hast found them to be liars
what the hell does it mean
it means whos side are you on
you didnt ask me to meet you miles from my office for a bible study class
its a bi partisan issue
everyone needs to swallow hard
no one including you wants to be fingered as the one obstructing efforts to crack down on terrorism and fuck you
i said fuck you
is that anyway to talk to an old school chum
youre gonna finger me as soft on terrorism
terrorism you unconscionable asshole
there are planes falling out of the sky buildings blowing up
americans getting bombs in the mail
what are we gonna do
were not gonna hand you and your band of lunatics the keys to the kingdom
im not gonna sit in congress and write a law that allows the nsa to point a camera and a microphone at anything they damn well feel like
and the next time you have something to say to me we do it above board in my office like everyone else
now get outa my car ive got a committee meeting on the hill
reynolds regards hamersley a moment then opens the car door hamersleys car snakes down the twisting mountain road
hamersley makes verbal notes concerning the reynolds meeting into his memo recorder as he drives
he picks up his cellular phone and punches in a number
senator alberts office the line goes dead
hamersley tries again but cant get a dial tone
then in the rear view mirror a brown sedan gains fast
whoever the guy is hes flying
then a man with a rifle leans out the sedans window
hamersley flies into a blind curve
tires screech as he rounds the bend to see a propane truck
blocking both lanes of the road
hamersleys eyes widen
he stomps the brakes skids and slams into the truck
the explosion engulfs everything
hamersley and the car are consumed
the pursuing sedan slows to a stop
the men watch
the cars an inferno
the men pull a u and drive away
a well appointed big city law office filled with citations of merit and pictures of a wife and child
robert dean a likable young lawyer sits behind his desk with his back to an older man
he stares at a commanding view of washington d
as he listens to a tired smoke and whiskey voice
i dont know how much longer we can hold out mr

dean dines in a booth with rachel banks s
rachel opens her briefcase removing an x envelope

an old building needing rehab
a sidewalk vendor does brisk business we drift to an apartment window above
police are labeling it an accident but promise a full investigation
zavitz is staring intently at his computer monitor
we dont know yet what hes looking at but hes scared to death as we continue to listen to the news report
don hamersley senior gop congressional leader was serving as a negotiator on the house senate sub committee studying the anti terror bill
zavitz leans in a little closer to get a better look at his computer screen not wanting to believe what hes seeing
the controversial legislation that would give various law enforcement agencies expanded authority in the fight against terrorism
and now we see what zavitz is staring at on his computer monitor
the film he shot at shenandoah park
the meeting between hamersley and reynolds
known as the voice of caution hamersley was an outspoken advocate of
zavitz reaches over picks up the phone and punches in some numbers with one hand
with the other he punches some keystrokes on the computer

close on reynolds sitting in the back
well dressed and alone he reviews a bible
his cellular phone rings
we hear static as two encrypted lines find digital compatibility
finally a confirmation tone go ahead
misty forests sweep down a hill to the chesapeake bay
a road leads to a high voltage security fence and guard shack
beyond are several windowless concrete structures bristling with microwave antennas and satellite dishes
a sign reads prohibited area

the screen reads transfer theres a knock at the door
zavitz looks over

zavitz disconnects a video digitizer removes a game cartridge containing the digitized video
and inserts it into a gameboy
he steps to the door and eyes the peep hole
zavitz pov a fish eye view of a fed ex man jones looking bored

stepping to the window all right

zavitz pov two dwp installers hovering in a bucket across the street
down below a cargo van with a multiple roof antenna is double parked near a fed ex van
then through a street windows reflection zavitz sees his buildings front entrance
several tenants are being prevented from entering by two men plain clothes one with a radio communicator pressed to his ear
zavitz backs from the window seized by panic
he grabs his phone
he picks up his fax line
he grabs the gameboy goes to a small side window and opens it
a ledge snakes around the corner
an athlete hes not but theres no choice
he squeezes out
pratt wearing a fed ex uniform is laying in wait
through pratts earphone go to three

package is out the window
pratt sprints down the hall pulling out his pistol as jones kicks in zavitzs door and rushes in
the windows open
jones looks out as the last of zavitz goes around the corner of the ledge
through joness headset to
weve got the eyeball
its the rooftop zavitz is heading to
two men crouch behind a wall watching zavitz approach
into headset well take delivery from here
zavitz inches along scared breathless
he looks back
maybe he was wrong
a pigeon suddenly flies by
zavitz loses his balance struggles
he crashes through an awning and into a sidewalk fruit stand
dazed zavitz crawls to his feet as passersby watch speechless
things happen fast
the cargo van rips from the curb but is suddenly blocked by a delivery truck
hicks s and athletic leaps from the van
fears confirmed zavitz starts down the sidewalk shakes off pain and moves to a run
except now theres someone in front of him
reaching a doorway zavitz pushes
the door opens to zavitz charges through and kicks open a fire door
an alarm blasts as he exits to a garbage truck screams up the alley
theres no way to outrun it
theres a fire escape above a dumpster
breath rasping he struggles on the dumpster pulling himself up the ladder just as the truck obliterates all below
zavitz struggles and climbs
reaching a landing he pauses for breath
and sees hicks and two others just moments behind
zavitz grabs a fire escape door tugs pulls and bangs it open to zavitz hurtles by trips get up runs again adrenaline pumping as pursuing sounds near
he pitches down a staircase shoves two people and rips through he flies past the diners and exits into hicks and another fly out of the diner just in time
to see zavitz melting in with christmas shoppers that are entering a department store
we see that the large sign over the entrance to the store reads harrisons
an upscale store packed with christmas shoppers
at a fashion ramp a small crowd of mostly women have gathered to watch leggy models feature a particular line of lingerie
mixed in among this group is dean a shopping bag in each hand his briefcase tucked under one arm trying his best to affect an air of the studious shopper

the sales clerk goes around the counter to the rear area
dean glances at the fashion show when he glimpses zavitz hurrying through the womens dressing area desperately looking for an exit
zavitz moves toward dean about to break for the front but hicks is there searching
trapped zavitz ducks behind a display
dean watches unaware of zavitzs pursuers
then it clicks
zavitz turns frightened

dean looks around
zavitz is gone
out on the street zavitz shoves into a group of shoppers waiting for the light
then he sees hicks and his partner
they see him
fuck the light
zavitz runs into the street as a bus speeds through yellow
zavitz is caught in its path
only stunned witnesses remain
dean exits the department store
he sees the commotion and makes his way over
to a bystander what happened
a guy got hit by a bus
sirens can be heard in the distance
dean eyes the ground where the body lays
he sees zavitzs bloody quietly ah
deans bmw drives through a neighborhood of stately homes all magnificently decorated for christmas
dean drives a little shaken by events
the radio plays an at t commercial relaying the joys of home tele conferencing
dean enters the driveway of his picture perfect home

he opens his briefcase and takes it out
reynolds busts out of the room phone to his ear
two men in suits wait like pit bulls ready for anything
over the phone we hear connecting handshakes as the lines find digital compatibility
the store is now closed
hicks holds a cellular phone as pratt questions the sales clerk
nearby a monitor shows a time coded surveillance tape of the lingerie section
dean and zavitz are in playback engaged in their earlier meeting
finally a confirming tone
hit by a bus

a crystal city attorney
assess the threat
then cross check against zavitz
red flag the intersects and anything we can exploit
pull up the keyhole tapes
i need to own him
i need to own him now establishing
a massive complex surrounded by razor wire and surveillance cameras
we push in on one building several blocks long
its roof is bristling with antennas dishes and domes
tight on manila folder stamped a skinny man clutches the folder walking by endless cubicles of high tech industriousness
he stops where an analyst types on a terminal near a retinal scanner
the analyst opens the folder to see a request for a priority wrap on robert dean followed by a social security number
the analyst enters in the number
close on computer screens showing in the harvesting of deans electrical identity
his phone bills scroll by
names addresses employment people called months years flashing by quickly
other data banks are probed
insurance policies credit histories video rentals library checkouts school transcripts atm transactions tax returns
irregularities are red flagged
a matching zavitz item is found
deans banking info is red flagged
he has large cash withdrawals with no matching purchases
his withdrawal dates match up with unaccounted for cash deposits
in rachel banks savings account
close on printer
conclusions spill out labeled risk
more probes are recommended into the rachel banks robert dean money connection
close on eye being scanned we hear a tone
pull back to a pregnant woman sitting with her head pressed to the scanner
a second verification tone sounds
a poster above her work station reads she enters a phone number in her terminal
the computer dials
she waits snacking on rice cakes
finally another computer answers
on screen appears pac tel testing board
the screen fills with choices
she highlights she enters another command
a new prompt reads enter eyeing deans folder she enters the phone number and commands enter
the telephone tap is instant
a voice graph appears in sync with conversation now coming over the speakers
mid conversation over speakers dianes instinct is that its sabre rattling
i think theyre gonna file suit
she enters more commands
an automated voice transcriber kicks in
deans conversation is now transcribed automatically
a massive dark place growing with monitors and tech
names of world regions are posted above endless monitor screens displaying live digital image feeds of earth coming in from the keyhole spy satellites
every populated area of the planet is covered here
analysts attend the many feeds
a poster reads on another poster a mans running shadow in a target bulls eye with a caption reading beneath a sign reading u
north east coastal region an analyst reviews time coded digital sat videos of washington d
as seen from space the capitol appears to be nothing more than a greyish mass
the analyst keys commands into his system
close on monitor the overhead sat view of washington moves in closer soon streets are discernible then cars and buses then an accident in an intersection with flashing ambulance lights
and a bus
a body lies twisted in the street its zavitz
the analyst enters additional commands
the zavitz bus accident freezes then plays in reverse as if recorded by the eye of god
the scene continues reversing following close on zavitz as he back tracks into harrisons department store
close on another analyst facing three monitors showing additional views of zavitzs escape as captured by a traffic camera an atm camera and the security inside harrisons
weve checked everything
nro tapes traffic surveillance monitors two techies huddle by a monitor overseen by fiedler a computer expert
the monitor displays the harrisons surveillance tape of the zavitz dean meeting
and two atm cameras
the one showing promise though is this security camera from the department store
to techie freeze there
the techie hits a command
zavitz and dean freeze on screen
the techie boxes the area to be enhanced
he types commands
the boxed area increases ten fold
focus on the drop
the enlarged view shifts to deans gift bags
the pictures fuzzy
someone passes by blocking the view at a crucial moment
enhance then forward frame by frame
the computer takes over clarifying the image with passes of resolution
hicks leans in closer as the image of the bag inches forward
just before the views blocked zavitz reaches in his jacket for something
when the view returns theres a shape change in deans bag
see the shadow variance
we reverse imaged it fiedler points to another screen displaying a digitally enhanced image of the shadowed object and its approximate shape
somethings definitely been added
its not a video cassette the shadows wrong
reynolds steps forward
his eyes are red
its been a long night
whats your opinion
its hard to say for certain these things are im not asking you to say for certain
this is what youre trained to do right
then whats your goddam opinion
beat zavitz had digital compression equipment
he couldve downloaded into something
a disk a chip anything small enough to put in his pocket and run with
whatever he put it in he dropped it in that bag
to hicks get it
reynolds heads for the door
wed have to get it
dean drives with stacy as eric sleeps in the back seat
various hats and souvenirs tell us that theyve just come from a redskins game
they drive in silence for a moment before
howd you get the information on depinto

the range rover pulls into the driveway
the deans enter the doorway
eric and stacy are first
they stop faces shocked
dean hasnt noticed yet
his hand automatically goes to the alarm key pad
close on the pad the led reads armed
dean punches the code oh my god dean turns
the house is ransacked
the alarm suddenly blares adding mayhem
close up on the ceiling vent the camera pushes in tight revealing a concealed fiber optic video lens the size of a pin head
several cars and a florist van are parked on the quiet street
the van is really an electronic surveillance post jammed with the latest equipment
a techie with headphones eyes a monitor
close on the monitor showing the pin hole surveillance view of stacy walking through a disheveled room in a state of shock while dean pulls out his cellular phone and
through the techies headphones this is robert dean at sutton place
i want to report a break in
a black ball slams against a wall
pull back to dean whos angry frustrated and drenched in sweat
hes embroiled in a hard fast game with his friend jerry
they took the espresso machine
the espresso machine jerry

serve the ball
a busy lobby for a major complex
dean freshly showered steps from a door marked to parking levels
dean turns to see morelos s an obsessive man with a terminal smile

zavitz was in trouble

i dont know whats goin on with zavitz but that was way way outa line

dean steps into the elevator
into concealed sleeve mic to
hes coming up
dean walks down the hall toward his office
he stops by peers as he enters his office

we did some work for him a few years back and there should be a file
dean enters his office and turns his computer on
it beeps boots and loads
levin approaches the mens room
a maintenance man cleans up broken glass and water by the door
a sign reads closed for maintenance
levin turns and leaves
into concealed sleeve mic to
two more maintenance men kneel in a stall adjusting a portable monitor and oscillator
they aim a directional antenna using slow sweeping motions
close on the monitor displaying the intercepted signal
its deans computer screen with text being typed in
the words are hard to read due to horizontal drift
after adjusting the antenna the signal smooths
we push closer
the signal shows the current display of deans computer screen
we see deans o
command pull up his e mail
a prompt asks for a password
a switch is flipped
xxxxxxx becomes puccini
deans secure file opens
a large busy place
lawyers and aides bustle in and out of this structure
a busy morning as attorneys wait their turn to present motions before the judge
dean is seated next to levin making notes
whispering dick burns got a phone call this morning from someone wanting information on you
he said they were doing a credit check
are you refinancing a loan
you remember daniel zavitz
he got hit by a bus
what does that have to do with you
i honestly dont know
another attorney sits several rows back watching the proceedings briefcase in his lap
close up on the attorneys ear with a mini receiver
from it drift snippets of the dean levin conversation
was zavitz in trouble
i dont know
a pulled back leather flap on the attorneys briefcase reveals the tip of a concealed microphone
you think there was a connection to jesus
i just told you

dean waits for the garage attendant to bring down his car
two men pratt and bingham approach him
pulling out a card wed like to ask you some questions about daniel zavitz
who are you people
handing dean the card im an investigator with pro tech security
i went through this with an investigator this morning

wed like to recover any materials mr
zavitz may have given you he didnt give me otherwise we may have to otherwise you may have to what
wed rather not fuck you

beat we may have to explore additional avenues
we hear a recording of the conversation between dean pratt and bingham while were close on an ink needle measuring deans voice stress levels
he didnt give me otherwise we may have to otherwise you may have to what
wed rather not fuck you
you may have to hicks turns off the recorder
standing with him is reynolds the dean file and voice stress graph laid out before him
hes arrogant and threatening
voice stress points suggest hes worrying
it was in his bag

i dont want anyone listening to a word he has to say
tell me about rachel banks
a massive clubhouse surrounded by expensive cars and tended grounds
we hear strains of gershwins they cant take that away from me from inside
guests mill about
dean and stacy are standing by the reception table where name tags and seating assignments are laid out
dean picks up a card that reads mr

the gala swings everywhere but here
dean and stacy are the only other diners at the table

a glass and steel high rise reaching upward
dean sits behind his desk as his secretary martha enters
its rachel banks

downtown washington d
a busy night
dean stands at the registration desk facing a desk clerk
returning card im sorry sir this cards been declined

the clerk runs it through
he returns the card embarrassed for dean
dean turns to leave
and stops dead
he stares at the empty floor by a pillar
my suitcase sir
my suitcase is gone
dean walks quickly around the area looking at everything and everyone
im sure we can locate it for you sir
dont count on it
dean stands at the atm waiting for cash
theres a short line of people behind him
his bank card spits out
the monitor reads temporarily unable to process this transaction pounding the machine god dammit
the waiting people back away
a weathered sign reads all rooms
tv drones the latest at t commercial soft and seductive have you ever tucked your kid in from a phone booth
you will close on an old color tv
the commercial ends
a newscaster returns to deliver the late night news
on tv in richmond today senate majority leader sam albert paid a visit to promote the ten billion dollar anti terror bill
the newscast cuts to sam albert late s standing on state capitol building steps delivering a speech to community leaders
on tv america is under assault and this time its from within
the gangs the terrorists the drug lords the cults
pulling away from the tv we explore the room
dimly lit and cluttered with tired furniture
on tv its a war like any other war
a war with victims and a war that requires courage and strength
outside the window a buzzing neon sign flickers red and blue
we finally end on dean sitting on a sagging bed rubbing his eyes
the newspaper with the doctored up photo is sitting next to him
italian area of baltimore
a s era box building
a sign reads italian american legion members only thread bare chairs and a couch
sal and frankie both meaty guys in shiny shirts sit facing dean who stands before them

a sign reads the audobon society national headuarters he shot wildlife footage meg burton sits near an editing machine as two editors review endless amounts of bird footage

i know but wildlife footage for gods sake
i dont see how he couldve slipped you something that the fbi would be interested in
thats my point
whats your point
well i need to find out as much about daniel as possible
because my life is being ruined
daniels life is already ruined
maybe if you guys stopped thinking about yourselves for a change and establishing
the baltimore water front
a crusty bar overlooking the bay
sunlight slashes blinds revealing a place that is wrong during the day
jimmy a beefy bartender takes stock of the liquor while rachel sits in a dark booth
rachel looks up
youre just what i need right now
you got a minute
getting up its really not a good idea for me to be seen with you
whos doing this
i gotta go
blocking the door will you hang on just a second
there a problem
she looks at dean for a moment
to dean outside
close on a surveillance camera on a pole sweeping making automatic lens corrections
theres a lot of people asking questions about you and me
we drift down to the harbor walkway a greenbelt with quaint hotels and bars on one side chesapeake bay on the other
dean and rachel are strolling the walk
the irs contacted me this morning
they say my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income
you being audited
for the last four years
my firmll represent you
free of charge
you dont work there anymore bobby
rachel were screwed

a technician eyes a recorder spin as a monitor shows a live feed from the park
through headphones i cant
through headphones you have to
through headphones ive never met him
through headphones goddammit rachel you assured me dean and rachel on their stroll fuck you
when you needed information i got it
you didnt care how

you want your job back
you want a life
i dont have a life bobby
im in love with a married man
im sorry about that
what makes you think its you
its not me
youre a moron you know that
and after a moment so does rachel
when i need to reach brill i chalk the mailbox on th and main
rachel is walking to the mailbox
she casually slashes the box with chalk and drops a letter inside
when he sees the mark he knows theres a drop
the locations always the same
wharves ships seagulls
a water bus chugs dockside as passengers board for the trip across the inlet
dean stands in a ticket line with the other the number twelve ferry to glen burnie
tuesdays or fridays
dean takes a seat
across the deck is seat
rachel takes the seat and casually slides an envelope behind it her actions obscured by a bag she carries
the ferry blows its departure horn
the drops behind seat
i leave something he picks it up later
the ferry churns water
rachel moves to a wind protected seat leaving seat empty
dean keeps watch on the seat as he scans the paper
any idea what he looks like
my guess is male somewhere in his s or s
a montage of different people occupying seat
a middle aged drunk passed out in the seat
a teen aged boy with glasses chats with friends
race height weight youre on your own
an old lady reads a book
she sees dean eyeing her and smiles nervously
dean returns to his paper
now i dont know how hes gonna feel about someone tracking him down
im sure he has his reasons
deans alone now
the ferry docks for the night
the last passengers two nuns disembark
dean rises to go
brills a no show
dean walks down the ramp
its dark in the empty terminal
not the best place at this hour
up ahead two men stand in the darkness then kissing
down another hall sounds of nearing footsteps
dean detours into empty
dean stands at a sink water running
he glances at the door
he splashes water on his face
suddenly deans slammed forward a silenced pistol is shoved into his ear pinning his face to the mirror
you want money
shut the fuck up
hands frisk dean
up and down the legs behind the back and chest
a wallet is removed ids looked at then returned
dean turns to see a man early s
he sweeps a signal frequency locator over deans body
the needle reacts at deans foot
gesturing your shoe
gimme the shoe
dean complies with the strange request as the man flips out a knife
he died of small pox when he was two and he was buried in a kansas field
prying away deans heel my name doesnt matter
close on deans heel a hollow compartment reveals a miniature tracking device
the man removes it then returns the shoe
thousand yard range
the man reaches in a trash can removes a potato chip bag wraps it around the tracker and flushes it down the toilet
brill goes through the window
dean eyes the window not sure
he eyes the door
dean crawls through the window to a loading dock
brill motions him to follow as he moves off into the shadows
the sounds of the window opening behind them followed by footsteps
brill shoves dean behind a dumpster and removes his gun as two men run by
the steps fade
a closed farmers market by the terminal
several cars are parked
ones a cab
brill opens the drivers door
dean grabs the front passenger door
in back like youre a customer
brill sits in the drivers seat eyes flickering to all views as dean climbs in the back
brill flips on the meter and guns into traffic
it started with the information you gave me on depinto
after we talked he agreed to resign
next a phony detective asked me about daniel zavitz
then an investigator questioned me about an extortion scheme they claimed zavitz was behind
the fbi started looking into mob connections
a doctored picture in the paper
overnight im ruined
job bank accounts everything gone
brill eyes the mirror
a black chevy appears several car lengths behind
they found him yesterday folded neatly in a car trunk
what about zavitz
brill starts to weave in and out of traffic
he looks in the mirror the chevys also weaving several cars behind
i dont know anything about zavitz
you said he was behind an extortion scheme
they said he was behind an extortion scheme
brill whips the cab around a corner accelerating
and you were the last one to talk to him
whatd he say to you
whatd he give to you
dont bullshit me i can save your life
im telling you i the ride from hell gets worse as brill screeches another turn
the car ahead stops and brill screeches past on two wheels
i just gave him my card
he didnt give you an address
he didnt give you a phone number
two nights later i was robbed
im pretty sure they were pros
brill takes an impossible left into another alley
the chevy follows
brill s good
the guy in the chevys better
did you check everywhere
maybe it was hidden in something
maybe there was someone else someone else
maybe you bumped into someone who took it and you didnt even know
the cab is rear ended hard by the chevy
their necks snap back from the force
theyre hit again
brill pulls out a communicator
i need some help here
who are you calling
brill back hands dean with his fist knocking him silly as wham
the cabs rear ended again
trying again this is
does anyone copy
then brill sees that the alley empties into a busy street then a bakery shop
he slams the brakes
tires screech smoke but its no use
the powerful chevy pushes the cab bumper to bumper toward the street
brill grips the wheel
its all he can do as the cab rockets into cross traffic and blam
theyre broad sided by a delivery truck
the cab is shoved sideways along the street and into a fire hydrant finally stopping under jetting water from the broken main
dean slowly opens his eyes
water pours in everywhere
brill is sticking halfway through a window not moving
seeing brill s pistol dean grabs it and crawls from the wreckage
dean climbs from the wreck as bystanders approach
hes got a gun
they back away as dean gets to his feet and looks around
off to the side he sees the chevy waiting like a coiled snake
dean limps into the crowd
he rounds the corner to another street and now hes running with all hes got left
stacy is at the desk looking at the latest edition of the paper which now has a photograph of dean and rachel walking in the park from the day before
the phone rings and stacy reaches for it
into phone hello
dean stands at a pay phone into phone stacy dont hang up
do you know what im looking at robert
stacy im looking at a picture of you and rachel taken yesterday i know but listen was that doctored up too

i went to the grocery store
my atm and credit cards didnt work

they said you emptied our accounts it wasnt me
this is science fiction robert
the manager showed me the transfer notice with your signature on it
stacy somebodys trying to kill me
now goddamit my fathers put me in touch with an attorney
hell be a hand suddenly clicks down the phone hook
dean turns to see a man late s gruff and alert
its the guy driving the chevy
put the phone down
do as i say
dean does nothing temporarily frozen
a pistol jabs him hard
alright alright dean replaces the phone
the man removes deans gun
nearby two people chat at a restaurant hostess desk unaware
move to the elevators
dean does but is suddenly redirected through a roof access door
a technician sits in a van jammed with high tech surveillance gear
hicks is next to him a phone pressed to his ear
we just picked up his call
reynolds dressed in a tux presses his cellular to his ear while behind him marshal and shaffer also in tuxedos have a heated discussion
into phone minutes ago you said we had him
what in hells goin on out there
into phone he had help
into phone help from whom
he hears the answer christ
eight stories up and deserted
the lit dome of the capitol building shines like a beacon in the d
dean suddenly slams against a wall hey
forget me forget what i did for you
dont ever mention my name or try to contact me again
i dont know you i dont know your name i dont know what the hell you did for me except hang up on my wife and slam me into a
wall but im getting pretty fuckin sick of this
pause youre brill
you knew the deal
who was that other guy
one of many people who would live a word with you
who are they
youve heard of the national security agency
what do they have to do with this
thats who they are
starting to leave okay
you drive a black bmw license plate srk
reaching in his pocket i clipped this from your wheel well just before they towed your car away
brill pulls out a disk shaped object the size of a walk man
what is that
its a sat tracker
i dont know what that means
like a lowjack but two generations ahead of what the police use
it pulses at giga hertz
i dont know what that means
they use that band for the aquacade spy sat uplinks
i dont know what that means
it means the nsa can read the time off your wristwatch
why are they after me if i knew theyd be after me which they probably are right now
what do i do
pal youre cooked
what you did who you were
id find a quiet job somewhere shoveling snow
a helicopter hovers near the washington monument
brill eyes it cautiously
why dont they just identify themselves and tell me what they want
i dont know what that exposure
they cant have it
they wanna learn what you know and then deal with it
i dont know anything no shit
what am i gonna do
i mean like for the rest of my life hey if you live another week ill be impressed
what if look you gave me some work over the last year
well call it even
brill turns to leave blocking the exit door what if i find out what theyre after
you know these people i dont
and you wont
now move ill pay you
taking out his pistol they froze your accounts
get outa my way
dean continues blocking the door maintaining calm even as brills pistol is pressed firmly to his forehead
ive got a hundred thousand dollars in jewelry in a safe deposit box under a third party name
brill looks at the ground
how many years have you been hiding from them
how many years have you been running
beat whatd they do to you
pause if you find something chalk the baltimore sheraton mailbox and go to temperanceville
its south of salisbury
giving dean his pistol and take this
and with that hes gone
dean eyes the gun
he walks to the ledge looking at the city
deans pov several vehicles quietly pull up to the building
men storm out an move inside
dean quickly backs away
dean races for the stairwell two steps at a time
he hears the sound of a door opening somewhere below
floor one secured
moving to two
dean retreats upward then he hears someone coming down
he opens the door on and is about to run when he sees a security camera directly above
grabbing a fire extinguisher he pulls the pin
spray coats the lens
then he yanks a fire alarm
a horn blares
dean runs for the second stairwell when he sees jones stepping out
dean looks back at the stairwell he left
that doors opening as well
using the extinguisher dean smashes the glass door to an office and goes inside
jones starts to enter when a shot rips into the wall convincing him otherwise
he retreats as the blaring fire alarm stops
dean races through the suite of offices trying locked door after locked door
finally one opens and he rushes in and tries to lock it behind himself
he sees the men and they see him
he slides a desk against the door then backs away pistol ready
disturbingly calm open the door mr
theres nowhere to go
wed just like to talk
seeing a phone dean grabs it
just a recording of nancy sinatras song these boots are made for walking
itd be easier for all of us if you just come out
dean heaves a coffee table up on the desk
its quite hopeless what youre doing mr
i swear to god ill shoot
chuckling i think you might be over reacting there mr
we just want to talk
i hear you fine
the door pushes in i said ill shoot
the door keeps pushing
dean fires high
the pushing stops
then dean hears the distant sound of sirens approaching
dean rips off his sweater takes out a lighter and sets the sweater on fire
he throws it into a garbage can and tosses styrofoam cups in on top of it
the pushing starts again but before dean can fire a small cylindrical device drops into the room
dean ducks as a blinding flash rocks the room
the window is blown open
smoke billows out
dean temporarily blinded and deaf struggles to a ledge as fire engines arrive
fire trucks police cars and an ambulance arrive beneath dean as hicks watches from his van
i dont fuckin believe this
into radio mic to all units
well take him at the hospital
dean sits in back with a para medic covered in soot breathing hard through an oxygen mask as the ambulance wails and weaves through traffic
he looks through the rear window to see two cars following keeping pace
off to the side rfk stadium is emptying a redskins game is over
dean rips off the oxygen mask tell him to stop the ambulance
whoa there fella
just take it easy
tell him to stop the ambulance
now youre a little shaken up but were gonna get you on your feet in dean whips out his pistol and shoves it in the paramedics face to the driver
stop the ambulance
the ambulance pulls over and the back doors fly open
dean leaps out into the crowd
the other cars pull over and pratt and jones exit
they scan the area and see dean descending a stairwell marked metro
dean stands at the end of the crowded platform
pratt and jones work through the crowd as the train pulls in
dean slides on board
the departure horn sounds
jones and pratt step on
dean huddles in the back car panic breathing as pratt and jones move through the cars searching for faces
dean looks for an out
he sees an emergency stop handle
he yanks it forward
the brakes lock and screech
the train slows
dean opens the door
he looks around
just black curved track in either direction
he starts running
then he hears it
the horrible screeching of an approaching train
on one side the train he left
on the other a wall
he runs down the track with all thats left
pratt and jones reach the open door and see the oncoming train bearing down on dean
they duck in as the train swishes by
dean lays flat between the tracks his face kissing greasy ground as the train screeches over him
tons of angry steel are teasing his shirt fabric
then its over
the trains gone
he gets up to see pratt and jones leap to the tracks
under his breath i hate these guys
then he sees an emergency access sign beaming in the darkness
a god send
dean runs for it
pratt and jones fly out the door and into a park
no dean anywhere
im confused about something
maybe you can help me out
the lincoln memorial is seen in the distance
reynolds has broken off party guests and paces in his tux an encrypted cellular phone pressed to his ear
i sit on top of the greatest intelligence gathering organization in human history
why cant i bring in a man whose name is in the fucking phonebook hes clever
he had help
he had help
sir no no im sorry
i didnt realize you were hoping to be transferred to a weathership outside greenland

i also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with do i look like i want a tiny pizza
then lets assume i dont
the waiter goes back inside
into phone now is that clear
reynolds disconnects breathes deeply and goes back to the party
dean watches from the shadows
it seems quiet
hes about to move for the entrance when he sees a cigarette lighter flame up inside a parked car
two men sit inside watching
dean retreats into the shadows
dean listens through the door and hears nothing
he knocks softly
he tries the doorknob
the place is still
dean drifts through the living room
a lamp is knocked over on the floor
dean keeps moving into the bedroom
he stops in the doorway eyes fixed inside
deans pov rachel lies on her stomach naked in bed
she doesnt respond
he touches her
he turns her over
her face is frozen eyes open neck purpled and bruised with signs of strangulation
oh god dean wants to throw up but holds it down
then under a night table he sees a shirt
he grabs it
deans pov an oxford button down
the inside collar is stamped with a dry cleaners marker reading r
panic overtakes horror as dean quickly searches for anything else of his that may have been planted inside the apartment
under the bed a cufflink
in the bathroom a hairbrush
on the desk documents with his name on them
dean shoves everything into a garbage bag
grabbing a towel he retraces his steps wiping his prints from everything he touched
exiting he wipes off the doorknob as a neighbors door opens
a couple stumbles out laughing kissing
and noticing dean leaving rachels condo
jerry walks alone through the large underground garage on the way to his car
he pauses thinking hes heard something
he continues walking
he reaches his car
suddenly someone comes up behind him fast
jerry spins its dean
whispering jerry christ

jerry looks at the ground for a long moment
im sorry man

dean starts to leave
piece of advice
turn yourself in
go fuck yourself
a quiet street in deans neighborhood
several reporters are camped in deans driveway entrance sipping coffees
farther down the street a jeep grand cherokee is parked
the driver waits and watches
dean sneaks between two large houses ducking by windows and scaling a fence
somewhere a dog barks a warning as dean plows through a large hedge entering the backyard to his home
dean quietly unlocks the door and enters
the house is quiet
keys jingle in the front lock
the door opens and stacy enters
the tv suddenly remotes on volume loud
she turns as dean approaches fast robert deans hand cups her mouth as he pulls her into a pantry closet
barely a whisper listen to me
the house is bugged
so we gotta be quiet okay
stacy nods understanding
dean slowly removes his hand
whispering is eric in school
has anyone been by
i wish youd gone to your parents like i asked you
this is my house
nobodys kicking me out of my house
i picked those drapes
i dont think anybody wants the drapes stacy i think the drapes are okay
what happened to your head
i was in a car chase and a small explosion
now listen to me the nsa is behind this
they think that guy i told you about daniel zavitz they think zavitz gave me a tape or computer chip of some kind that could be damaging to them
so theyre doing all these things electronically the bank records the surveillance
theyre the ones who broke into the house
now i know theres no reason to believe me
but i love you
and i love our son
so just believe me anyway
stacy gently touches his forehead where hes been cut
does that hurt
stacy she grabs him and kisses him
the kiss lasts a good long time before stacy smacks him on the arm told you they could do this
i told you they had this kind of capability and that with this anti terrorism it would be just another stacy
maybe now isnt the best time for the i told you so speech
she kisses him again
im sorry i didnt believe you
i opened the present you got me from harrisons
you opened the thing
that was for christmas
i was missing you
youre as bad as eric
ive got an entire family of people who root through it dawns on him
everything starts coming together
who root through
what is it
the driver continues to watch the area
then drivers pov the range rover flies out of the driveway tires screeching as it speeds through the quiet neighborhood
the reporters stare at each other a beat then leap for their cars
into sleeve mic to
rovers fleeing west on sutton
driver appeared male radio effect whats the wifes
shes off location with a friend
take him down
unmarked cars of various descriptions rapidly appear from nowhere giving chase
radio effect to ive got the eyeball
hes approaching ridgeview well take him at the intersection
the range rover speeds through the neighborhood
suddenly two cars are out in front blocking the way
the range rover swerves and breaks as two more cars rip up behind boxing it in
an un marked trans am lags behind keeping reporters at bay
doors fling open
jones and three men all in plain clothes pistols and mac aimed at the range rover
the men move closer jones grabs the door and rips it open revealing deans piss frightened nanny behind the wheel in deans trench coat and hat
jones yanks her out puts her hard to the ground gun jammed to her head as other search the range rover for dean
dean drives the nannys rusted low rider dodge out of the driveway
he pauses and looks
the streets are empty
he turns onto the street and calmly drives away
a playground jammed with kids
a kickball games in progress
eric waits his turn to kick
tracy a college age teaching assistant comes over
eric looks up
your fathers here
dean stands at the edge of the playground in clean casual clothes
eric runs over face glowing
do i know you
whereve you been
having an adventure
i cant tell you about it right now but ill tell you about it soon
are you and mom getting a divorce
were never getting a divorce
we were having a fight
it happens sometimes

in the meantime ive got a question for you and its incredibly important that you tell me the truth
under no circumstances will i be angry with you
this is a total get out of jail free card
did you take anything anything at all out of those christmas bags i brought home last week
eric hangs his head
then shouts to a group of kids on the playground
shouting dylan comes trotting over carrying his backpack
dylan i was just asking eric if oh god i knew it was stupid i knew wed get caught
but the gameboy was just sitting there
right on top of the bag
we took the gameboy out of the bag but with every intention of putting it back
pause youre a tough nut to crack dylan
dylan hunts through the backpack as dean and eric looks on
all kinds of junk flies out candy comics game cartridges it was broken when we found it i swear
i tried fixing it for you
i even put in new batteries
pulling out the gameboy the screen scrambles whenever you boot up
id try to get your money back
dean eyes the pieces of the gameboy knowing that somewhere in the puzzle of plastic and chips is the key to his problems
pedestrians walk on the sidewalk
a man comes along and drops a few letters in the corner mailbox
from the other direction comes dean
without stopping he casually slashes the mailbox with chalk
theres a soft shuffling sound
the camera explores for the source moving by the windows flashing neon a tv and finally the door
we push closer as a mule tool snakes under the door
the tool pops upright against the doors inside
the strap drapes over the doorknob and tightens
the doorknob turns and opens
someone slips in close on dean asleep
a hand covers his mouth
deans eyes go wide
then he sees its brill
whispering get dressed
whispering you could knock on the door you know and id open it
the mile chesapeake bay bridge crosses the bay like a serpent worming toward distant norfolk
traffic is thin at this hour
dean the attorney recently under investigation for a money laundering scheme was seen leaving ms
banks apartment late last night
we push in on a toyota pick up truck heading south
brill drives with dean riding shotgun
police are seeking brill ejects as cassette from the dashboard and hands it to dean
i taped it off the oclock news

oh ill bet that threw em off the scent
i sure hope you covered the mouthpiece with a handkerchief and used a funny voice
brill turns off the headlights does another u turn pulls off on an emergency road and stops
he turns off the engine rolls down the window looks up into the night sky and listens
brills pov a cloudy night
silent except for the water and a distant fog horn
no sounds of aircraft
looking up as well i dont hear anything
on brills silence maybe youre wrong
brill is staring upward
a hundred and fifty
a massive dark place filled with glowing monitors
close on a monitor displaying a live sat feed showing a thermograph image of brills truck
the color heat image of brill looking upward is fairly clear
he pops his head back into the truck and pulls onto the road
the satellite continues tracking the truck
its a consumated marriage
brill drives along a high fence surrounding acres of empty warehouses docks and rust bitten fences
hes still on constant alert looking for sign of their presence
the nsas been in bed with the entire tele communications industry since the s
theyve infected everything banks computers phones mail name it
stopping the car near the gate the more technology we buy into the easier it is keeping tabs on us
its a brave new world
handing dean the keys at least it better be
how do you know so much
none of your business
you used to work for em didnt you
i was a traffic analyst
dean gives him a look that says i dont know what that means
i intercepted phone calls
howd you get around the tap orders
they can tap anything as along as its an airwave intercept
cellulars and pagers your kid can do
driving through hard line calls wed pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the sats
wed suck in everything
all foreign most domestic
dean re closes the gate domestic was my group
druggies radicals loud mouths
anyone we wanted
climbing back in howd you have the manpower to driving again meade has underground acres of computers
they scan every phonecall for target words like bomb or president
we red flag phone numbers or voice prints
whatever we wanted
when the computers found something it was bounced to comparative analysis
that was twenty years ago
they can suck a salt grain off a beach
whyd you leave
i figured we had enough problems without monitoring a berkeley kids class schedule
so i sold my story to ramparts and split
they come after you
shrugging it off well
thered be too much disclosure to prosecute me
so they ruined my records and made sure id never hold a real job again
the pick up stops by a long two story warehouse
what do you think
looks like detroit
welcome to santas workshop
brill and dean enter the nd story of a large empty structure
dean is carrying a crumpled brown paper bag
in the center of the cavernous space a windowless cinderblock room built on foot supports
i call it the jar
no phone or utility lines going in
brill opens a side door revealing a mini generator
he pushes the start button
the generator hums to life
unplugged from the world
opening jar door nothing for a wire bug to piggy back in on
that leaves only transmitters and signal sweep for those
turning on the light now lets see what we got
dean tosses the paper bag to brill who empties its contents the pieces of the gameboy on to the table
dean sits alone smoking a cigarette and watching norfolk rise from dawns fog
in the distance we see brill coming down from the warehouse toward dean
he stands behind dean for a moment before
that is one ugly sunrise
pause it really is
pause did you find anything
beat take a walk with me
dean gets up and joins brill
the two of them start in the direction of the second warehouse
remember when senator hamersley died in an accident up near shenandoah
the nsa killed him
do you have proof
well actually you have proof
could you walk a little faster please
whats going on
here in the warehouse
theyre hiding in a duct on the third floor
when we go back inside theyre gonna kill us
when they notice that were moving toward the car theyll come running out of the building
kay well could you walk faster please
jones and three men are huddled in a duct
through radio theyre heading to the car
jones and the three men start down the corridor guns drawn
dean and brill are kneeling beside the chevy letting the air out of the tires
empty em till theyre almost flat
and turn your head
there might be some debris flying your way
and with that the first warehouse explodes sending a fireball of debris in all directions
what the fuck
they shouldnt have come without calling first
brill jumps into the chevy turns the key and the engine ignites
dean leaps in
brill stomps on the gas and tires screech
the chevy hurtles through the warehouse toward a shut garage door
brill clicks a remote
the door rises
outside the warehouse the chevy roars outward screams around a corner then speeds down a road lined with warehouses
dean looks down an intersecting road to glimpse a saturn sedan gaining on a parallel road
wheres your gun
they pass an area with no warehouses
the saturn turns heading straight at them
back at the warehouse
the saturn pulls on the road behind them
the man in the saturn leans out and fires an assault rifle
the side window by deans head shatters
brill one hands the pistol and checks the load
re the pistol gimme that
those are feds
taking the pistol i didnt see a warrant
did you see a warrant
the chevy enters a narrow lane the saturn right behind
with the chevys tires flat and flapping the saturn hugs their rear
dean looks back again as the rifleman the rear window explodes
dean pops up and fires three quick well placed rounds
the saturn swerves and drops back
dean looks forward to see an exit road blocked by an iron cross bar
brill unfazed pushes the chevy faster
beam or no beam hes going through
think we let out enough air
realizing oh my god
brill and dean hit the deck as the chevys hood scrapes just under the beam
the windshield frame takes the full impact
the beam slices through steel and glass decapitating the car
they emerge on the other side minus roof and windows as the saturn screech stops inches from the beam and debris
a man leaps out shoulders his rifle and aims but the chevy disappears around a building
a foggy morning
the rural highways deserted at this early hour
the chevy rumbles by
dean and brill windblown but alive remove shards of glass
brill eyes the road behind him
we lost em
that wasnt so hard
lets not do the tire thing anymore okay
yeah i can see where thatd he stops talking
he hears rotor thumps as a black helicopter appears over a fog laced hillside swooping down
brill floors it
the helicopter drops in closer as brill swerves back and forth while taking a curve at plus on flapping tires
a helicopter sharp shooter aims with an m
a spray of high powered slugs suddenly rip into the chevys hood
the engine starts knocking
these guys are incredibly persistent
tell me about it
the road straightens
up ahead a tunnel
more bullets slice the hood
radiator fluid starts hissing
the chevy starts dying
brill stomps the pedal squeezing out every last kick of horsepower
the helicopter swoops in lower and lower for the kill shot
the sharp shooter lines dean in his sights
the pilot keeps pace dropping closer
the sharp shooter has the shot
the chevy reaches the tunnels opening on sparking screeching wheel rims
the helicopter pulls up missing the hill by inches
but not the power lines
the pilot sees them too late
the helicopter flies into a web of cables
the upper rotor slices neatly off
the helicopters body rockets downward to the road where it bounces and skids like a rock on water until it meets an oncoming semi truck head on
brill tries steering but metal wheels on concrete dont work
the car shimmies like its on ice
sparks fly as they bash into the tunnel wall grinding to a stop
a grunge dude blasts his car stereo as he enters the tunnel unaware of the mayhem behind him
he slows seeing a smoking wreck ahead
closer he sees dean waving him down
he slows more
brill opens the rear door leaps in and points his pistol at the grunge dudes face
dean leaps in front
were not gonna hurt you
tell him were not gonna hurt him
drive or ill blow your fuckin head off
no he wont
goddammit were honest people and we need your help
ill give you two hundred dollars if you leaping out take it
actually i dont have two hundred dollars
drive the damn car
dean slides into the drivers seat drops it in gear and goes
the dodge erupts from the tunnel
up ahead the saturn and another car approach fast in the opposite lane speeding toward the tunnels opening
the cars fly by unaware of dean and brill passing in the dodge
the dodge continues on fading into the fog
reynolds and hicks walk down a white hallway three football fields in length filled with bustling employees conservatively dressed
we found two sets of latent prints in the rubble of brills studio
one was deans
the other we believe belongs to brill
his real names edward lyle
youre kidding me
deans with lyle
and they have the video
so they know everything
if theyve looked at the video
oh lets assume that they have
if hes with lyle it means hes got resources
resources thats a good point
hes got resources
all weve got is a six hundred billion dollar organization
now god dammit hicks you find em
you find em and you end it now
reynolds walks off leaving hicks to ponder his fate
plastic flags and prices slashed signs are everywhere
a blue taurus pulls off the lot
well take the tape directly to cbs
ill hand it directly to the news department
listen to you directly
youre not gonna get near the news department
and if you did itd never get on the air
time life buried the zapruder film for years
what about newspapers and magazines
so what do we do now
i was thinkin about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits
what if we do a mailing to congressmen
itd never get through
all packages are screened x rayed and then hand searched for explosives
you didnt like my give me my money idea
what if we hand deliver to their homes or office
the areas wired for surveillance theyll be looking for those moves
well how do know what theyre know
know what theyre looking for and im telling you
the car radio is playing a newscast
from the radio after which senator albert will address a fund raiser at boston university
what if we put it on the internet
have you seen how fuckin slow the net is
itd take ten minutes to unload enough video so that people know what theyre seeing and itd take the nsa maybe seconds to see it coming down and shut down
from the radio this will be the last stop on the senators eight city tour before the senate votes on tuesday
reconsidering but maybe if there were no phone line dean has started listening to the radio
what if we transmitted it over cellular
listen nah theyd shut down the pin number
what if if they couldnt do that theyd shut down the whole system all the relays
what if theyve done it before
takes maybe two minutes
what if what if what what if we just fucked with em
same way they did with you and me
we take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us
brill educates dean on simple ways to alter ones appearance
senator sam albert senior republican
very well respected
a large auditorium
preparations are being made for senator alberts upcoming speech
brill and dean casually case the area for vulnerabilities
well play the nsas game only well play it badly
a five star hotel overlooking massachusetts bay
you wanna get caught spying on albert
no i want the nsa to get caught spying on albert
christa hawkins late s the senators advance person stands at registration securing rooms for her boss and his team
were gonna lead albert by the nose to one conclusion
and then when hes pissed as hell were gonna drop the tape in his lap
how fast can you teach me what i need to know
how fast can you learn
next to christa looking conservative and altered in appearance is dean eavesdropping on the senators room numbers and any other pertinent info
one of those cheesy places in a mini mall
well have to re stock some basics
brill and dean go shopping
bugs frequency scanners contact mics transmitters pin holes fiber optics the curtains are drawn
devices cover the table and bed
what do you know about locking cellular phone signals
i know my phone number and i know the number for sportsphone
beyond that shit
dean drives while brill sits with his open pc lap top connect to his cellular phone
a modified oki interfaced with a lap top creates an enormously powerful tool
referring to the cell phone i got into the software did some code re writing and turned it into one of the best scan looking systems around
close on screen a street map appears with positions of the networks relays
lines appear indicating all in progress cellular calls along with their locations
this is every call on the grid
i can lock and position any one i want and follow the hand offs in real time
brill punches a number into the cellular and the phone locks on the signal
through the lap top we hear ringing and then an answering voice
this is dr
jonathan phillips stern drive in brockton
i need an airport ride on friday at pm with a return pick up monday at
therell be two of us and disconnecting need a place to stay for the weekend
a new tv
brill has repeated the process triple a emergency road service
may i have your name and membership number
card number unbelievable
all from a hundred dollar scanner at radio shack
but its time for business
brill dials his computer into a new line
tones and commands fly quick as brills computer modems into another
what are you dialing
ameritechs data base
pointing on the screen theres alberts d
office address and his phones identity code
now we just reprogram out phone with his id code and you know what weve got
mid conversation dont think it couldve gone any better

a receiver tuned permanently to the senators phone
a customized rv zips down the highway

albert speaks in the cellular phone while an aide patrick reviews last minute changes for alberts upcoming speech
not till later tonight

christa stands at the front desk as the clerk hands her several faxes
dean disguised sits across the lobby reading a paper
deans pov christa exits the hotel to a waiting car
into concealed sleeve mic she just left
numbered doors on each side
brill walks down the hall hair slicked mustache wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase
the important thing about installations is numbers
brill entering christas room and opening his briefcase revealing tools and listening bugs
they may find one but theyre not gonna find em all
brill planting devices behind the headboard inside the telephone behind the desk inside the tv brill rifling through christas personal items eyeing paper work photographing interesting documents
brill opening a connecting door picking a second lock and entering the adjoining suite
a clock reads am
the lights are on and the bed unslept in
christas not seen
then the connecting door opens christa steps from the senators adjoining suite in a silk robe nothing underneath
she turns in the doorway revealing albert naked in a towel
christa closes the door climbs in bed and grabs the remote
she clicks on the tv
feedback screeches from the set
she tries changing channels but the screeching continues
she tries turning off the set but it wont turn off
she grabs the phone and dials
into phone can you send someone up right away
im having a problem with my tv
its screeching and i beat its screeching and i christa is noticing that her voice is causing the tv image to distort in sync
its screeching and i cant turn it off
senator albert dines with an aide as patrick approaches a grave look on his face
patrick takes a seat
what happened to you last night
patrick reaches in his case and pulls out one of brills listening bugs and hands it to albert who puts on his eyeglasses
christa found it last night attached to her tv
its a listening device
we should everything checked
theres a company in cambridge called baudmore
seated next to alberts table is dean unnoticed as he sips coffee skims news and eavesdrops on their murmurs with a small concealed parabolic mic and ear phone
well get somebody down here today
i dont know what the hell this is all about
a phone distribution box is open revealing a mass of circuit boards
brill stands at the box holding a circuit dialer phone to his ear
dean watches patrick approach a pay phone
into sleeve mic hes going into the payphone outside the restaurant
its a cambridge company called baudmore
brill connects two alligator clips to a line inside the box
into sleeve mic got it
brills phone line immediately rings
into phone baudmore consultants

close on a frequency counter sweeping a chest of drawers
the device starts buzzing indicating a transmitter
brill disguised is on hands and knees searching under a chest where he discovers a bug he planted earlier
removing the transmitter oh yeah

brill shows it to patrick a very embarrassed hotel manager and a very serious head of hotel security
a remote on off three thousand foot range
shit you could listen from a shopping mall across the street
brill stands in front of senator albert
well sir im afraid its not as simple as that
your average newspaper guy or hard copy lady or whatever they cant buy this stuff
well then who can
ah sir you know its not for me to say

brill unwraps a towel revealing the grease covered nsa tracker he removed from deans bmw
i yanked this off your rv
its a global positioning tracker
oh my god
tracks your location to the inch and works directly with you know
with spy satellites
i dont like saying these things senator
shaking brills hand neil thank you for your help
patrick escorts brill out of the rv
the senator fuming opens a book looks up a phone number and punches it into his phone
into the phone this is sam albert
put me through to langley
dick marshals office
a place packed with students computers and teachers
dean sits in a corner reading a magazine but what hes really watching is a well dressed man at the counter his back to dean ordering a cup of coffee
the man glances at dean off the mirror behind the counter
brill walks in and joins dean
well let him stew for a day and then drop the tape
brill looks over at the well dressed man
he came in four minutes ago
theyre about to start for the front door when an unmarked police car pulls up in front
a rowdy group of frat boys flood in loud and busy
by the time they pass brill and dean are gone
the well dressed man scans the coffee shop and sees the back door swinging shut
dean and brill run down the street through an alley and over a fence to another street
they slow as they approach the parked taurus
brill takes the wheel with dean beside him
they pull into traffic
things look good but then the unmarked car and a squad car scream up behind lights flashing
brill dumps the car into low gear and the taurus comes alive
a cop picks up the radio mic
one lincoln nine
in pursuit of two suspects one matching description of robert dean wanted in connection with a homicide
suspects northbound on through alleys down streets under an overpass down a one way street barely missing a head on as they roar into a rail yard traversing the waterfront
brills at his best putting distance between himself and the cops at every turn
finally it looks as if theyve made it as they race down an alleyway only to realize its a dead end
brill slams into reverse
they screech backward tires smoking
the squad car rips into the alleyway boxing them in
brill hits the brakes
he looks back at the dead end and sees an empty flat bed trailer with a ramp
brill gives it everything
if they can get enough speed and hit the ramp right maybe they can clear the obstructing wall
not particularly no
they hit the ramp full speed
the front end bottoms at the taurus bounces skyward
tires clip the wall as the car flips and smashes into a parked rail car filled with coal
they arent going anywhere
back in the alley the squad car skids to a stop
a rookie climbs from his car leaps the wall draws his gun and nears
inside the taurus the windows are shattered
steam hisses gasoline drips and coal is everywhere
dean shimmies out through a broken side window
he barely gets to his feet as he stumbles yards or so
his foot accidentally dislodges a large pile of coal which buries him up to his waist and immobilizes him
to brill im stuck
help me out
he looks back to see that brill is hanging out the drivers side bleeding badly and covered in gas
on waist radio one lincoln nine suspects tad into a coal car at the fullbright rail yards
requesting back up fire and ambulance
an unmarked car with red flashers races up the rail yard and stops
the rookie turns as jones and krug hop out
flashing id fbi
what do you got
two murder suspects
ones wounded the others maybe dead
krug draws his silenced pistol and matter of factly shoots the cop dead
to krug check inside
dean is watching this all unseen helplessly trying to dig himself out of the coal
krug inspects the taurus interior for anything of interest
jones scans the area
to brill as he searches
i hate doin cops i really do
you i wont mind
didnt mind that rachel banks
didnt mind doin her one bit
seeing deans shoe your lawyer friend buried over there
brill can only gurgle blood
jones pops the tauruss trunk had looks inside
krug digs quickly through the coal pile searching for dean
then brill sees him brills pov dean down off the side of the coal car lodged in the coal pile
hes safe but not once krug discovers hes not in the car
brill pushes in the cigarette lighter
jones dumps everything from the taurus into the unmarked car
sirens suddenly fade in
krug digs faster looking for dean as jones approaches with his pistol clambering around for brill
fuck him hes dead in two minutes
jones starts to back out just as the tauruss cigarette lighter pops out
brill grabs it
krug eyes the glowing lighter
then he eyes brill
brill ignites the gas
a fireball explodes consuming all the car brill krug
jones is blown off his feet from the concussion
scrambling away fuck jones wipes prints off his pistol and silencer and tosses it into the flames as the police cars approach
dean watches from the shadows as flames incinerate everything
i just came from my office at langley
senator albert called me there
marshal and shaffer dine with reynolds at a restaurant overlooking the potomac
i got the same call at the bureau

its ending at your doorstep
reynolds rides in the back of the car a cellular to his ear
what about we dont know
the room is crammed with people as hicks talks over the phone
jones had to flee the scene before we could locate the second body
what about the tape
we think it was on brill
if it was its destroyed now
and if it wasnt
organ music can be heard as reynolds snaps his phone shut
peace be with you
a beautiful church in an expensive neighborhood
and also with you
a crowded catholic mass
the priest delivers a sermon from an altar decorated with christmas candles and evergreen
the lord said i leave you peace my peace i leave you
let us now in the spirit of these holidays turn to our neighbors and offer them a sign of peace
reynolds stands in a pew beside his two daughters and his wife
he turns to those immediately around him shaking their hands
peace be with you
peace be with you
a disguised dean takes reynolds hand and shakes it
do i know you
im robert dean

peace be with you
reynolds is dumbstruck
let us now offer up thanks to the lord our god in the words our father gave us
our father who art in heaven hallowd be thy name robert is it safe to be talking on the phone like this
dean sits on a bed while talking into a modified cellular computer
the screen shows his current call signal re routing between relay stations
into phone ive re routed the call
they cant trace it
into phone are you sure youre safe
into phone yeah
theyre saying you killed that policeman
thats gonna end tonight
pointing nine directions
the intercepted phone signals being relayed
where are you
i cant tell you that
a concrete building rising from the woods
can you tell me anything close on computer screens showing hundreds of phone numbers scrolling by
a massive vacume cleaner of every cellular call being made in the state of maryland
the computer scans for trigger numbers or words
i can tell you this that anti terrorism bill you were so worked up about
i dont think its gonna pass
a phone number locks on the screen got it
the phone on the nightstand begins to ring
reynolds wakes as his wife rolls to the other side of the bed
he grabs his scrambler phone and goes into reynolds closes the door and waits as scrambled lines connect
finally a confirming tone
hicks is on the phone
kent island nailed the call five minutes ago

everyone else is held back in reserve
he walked right up to me in church
at the holiest time of the wear
he approached me in a sanctified place
beat kill him now
peaceful street quaint apartments
three men stroll to the entrance of a well maintained building
one jimmies the lock and a moment later theyre in
hicks jones and davis prepare
all have miniature earphones
davis checks his silenced pistol
hicks activates a frequency locator
the needle snaps on
he looks at davis and jones
all hand signals no words as the trio ascend the staircase
one flight two
then hicks stops
the needle says theyre close
their targets on two
they move down the hall silent except for a creaking floor and a tv show drifting from an apartment
someones up at this hour
they move on
hicks watches the needle as it moves
he motions davis and jones to a door
jones puts a reverse viewer against the peep hole
joness pov a view of an entryway and living room
a light bleeds from an o
beyond that theres no sign of life
hicks puts a contact mic against the door and listens to faint conversation somewhere inside possibly the phone call
hicks nods to jones who quickly picks the lock while davis eyes the hall
after a nervous moment the door opens and hicks jones and davis enter
they spread out searching the well decorated condo for the target
they near the room with light
using a mini mirror hicks looks around the bend to see a bedroom
theres a briefcase on the bed
from the bathroom they hear sounds of running water
they slowly approach
wood again creaks beneath them
deans voice is heard through the locked door
hicks signals on three
he counts and they smash the door open to see a cellular phone taped to a baby monitor
deans nowhere in sight
the fuck is this
spinning banks of reporters manned by police dispatchers
we move to one desk where a phone rings
an led immediately displays the callers name kruger jack along with his social security number and date of birth
nine one one emergency
my names jack kreuger im at grambling
i just saw three guys break into the condo next door
it looked to me like they had guns
dean has the phone circuit box open and is plugged in with a phone line
over the phones mouthpiece he holds an electronic voice mask which alters his voice into an old mans
well send a unit over there now
if its safe sir wed like you to stay by your phone
yeah i think ill stay where i am
radio effect any available unit
armed in progress
three technicians overhear the police radio call
three suspects now inside
into radio to first team
we got the cops
hicks spins and heads for the door
davis hits it first
he grabs the doorknob and pulls and the knob rips from the door trailing small wires
whatd you do
it came off in my hand
two squad cars come rolling up and four cops get out and head into the building
jones is trying to pry the door open with his fingers
over radio get outa there guys
while jones continues on the door davis runs to the window
throughout this hicks will stand in the middle of the room and simply oddly stare at the mantle over the fireplace
god damit hicks smiles
and now he starts laughing a little
whats so fuckin funny
hicks motions to a framed picture over the fireplace
weve been fucked with our pants on
the framed picture is of senator sam albert and christa we broke into her condo
door wood explodes inward
the two cops roll in crouched positions weapons drawn
hicks doesnt move davis freezes like a deer in headlights jones stares with cold dead eyes
two more cops arrive
jones and davis drop their guns
they do so
cops three and four go room to room making sure no one else is lurking
in the bedroom they find the briefcase
inside the briefcase listening bugs installation equipment and compromising photos of the senator with christa
oh my god
whats going on
back in the living room christa has walked through the broken in apartment door to see jones hicks and davis lying on the floor at gun point
maam is this your apartment
would you step out in the hallway for a moment maam
well be right with you
christa backs slowly out of the apartment and into christa holds her hand over her mouth and is shaking
a voice comes from an alcove
dean steps out from the alcove
you got a second
who are you
my names robert dean
an up scale neighborhood
two inexpensive cars that dont seem to belong there sit in front of a large home
dean sits with a drink in his hand
across from him are christa and patrick
they sit in uncomfortable silence for a moment before senator albert enters in bathrobe and pajamas
i understand we have a problem
senator senator there were some things i couldnt tell you over the phone
what kinds of things
dean has a video tape from the hotel room in boston
pause i see
its actually dh digitech pinpoint scanning with a frequency modulator
i dont know what that means
me neither but the upshot is ive got color live action footage of you and ms hawkins and it doesnt look good
how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life
i dont want any money
and believe me i have no interest in ruining your life
im not interested in this tape
then what do you want from the senator
i want him to look at a different tape
people have been killed
lives have been ruined
dean takes the computer chip from his pocket senator i want you to look at this
and i want you to bring the fury of god himself upon this man
dean tosses the chip to albert
reynolds is asleep when the phone wakes him up
once again he reaches for his scrambled phone heads into the bathroom
after waiting for the signal that the lines clear
sir weve just intercepted an fbi communication
into phone well
what is it
well sir it seems theres a warrant out on the doorbell rings
reynolds is alarmed
now theres banging at the door and doorbell rings again
from the bedroom who is that dear
reynolds snaps the phone shut and goes downstairs to the door
when he opens the door he sees two fbi agents with their ids flapped open and six uniformed policemen backing them up
what the hell youre under arrest
you have the right to remain silent
anything you say from upstairs honey
a paperboy tosses a newspaper at the deans door
privacy and the right to privacy is an inalienable right
stacy has c span on the tv while she makes breakfast for eric
senator albert is addressing the senate
these guys are always making speeches
its an important speech eric
theres gonna be a vote today
on tv today we face a threat to that creed
certain individuals in our intelligence community believe theyre entitled to examine lives in minute detail and claim to do it in the name of the common good
if theyre voting today hasnt everyone pretty much made up their minds
actually this man appears to have changed his mind dramatically
he saw the light my son
eric and stacy whip around dad
stacy and eric run to dean
is it over
how long can you stay
im not goin anywhere eric
i live here
eric and dean hug
get ready for school youre gonna be late

its okay to use the phone
but eric has disappeared up the stairs
its really over
alberts gonna get me my job back
pause im sorry about rachel
beat i wish you couldve met
a friend of mine
i dont know his real name
hes dead now
you did good
stacy points to the tv and dean watches for a moment
on tv ive lived through the dark ages of hoovers watch list and mccarthys witch hunts men who used moral crusades fired by fear to lay waste to our freedoms
ive got a christmas present from harrisons i want to show you
dean arrives as stacy takes him by the arm
they head upstairs as albert continues on
on tv our intelligence communities presently monitor our phones computers financial transactions medical histories
