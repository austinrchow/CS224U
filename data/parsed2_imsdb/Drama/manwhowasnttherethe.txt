b if window
href b b the man who wasnt there ethan coen joel coen black
yeah i worked in a barbershop
but i never considered myself a barber
we track back from a barbers pole
i stumbled into it well married into it more precisely
we track back from a shopkeepers bell triggered by an opening door
the pull back and tilt down show the top of the head of a customer entering in slow motion
i wasnt my establishment
like the fella says i only work here
we track along a shelf backed by a mirror and holding pomade aftershave hair tonic a whisk brush
the dump was feet square with five chairs or stations as we call em even though there were only two of us working
we track in on a big man in a barbers smock scissoring across a lock of hair that he pulls taut between two fingers of one hand
in slow motion he laughs and chats
frank raffo my brother in law was the principal barber
and man could he talk
another man in a barbers smock is running electric clippers across a childs head
a cigarette between his lips
now maybe if youre eleven or twelve years old franks got an interesting point of view but sometimes it got on my nerves
not that id complain mind you
like i said he was the principal barber
franks father august they called him guzzi had worked the heads up in santa rosa for thirty five years until his ticker stopped in the middle of a junior flat
he left the shop to frankie free and clear
and that seemed to satisfy all of franks ambitions cutting the hair and chewing the fat
me i dont talk much
he plucks the cigarette from his mouth and taps its ash into a tray
i just cut the hair
the barbershop is empty of customers
late sun slants in through the front window
the two barbers the narrator and his brother in law sit in two of the barber chairs idly reading magazines
says here that the russians exploded n a bomb and theres not a damn thing we can do about it
how dya like them apples
russians exploded an a bomb
shaking his head jesus
now being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda jerk theres not much to it once youve learned the basic moves
for the kids theres the butch or the heinie
we cut to examples of the haircuts as they are ticked off the flat top the ivy the crew the vanguard the junior contour and occasionally the executive contour
adults get variations on the same along with the duck butt the timberline
ed trims the fringe around a balding head
and something we call the alpine rope toss
he snips one long lonely strand of hair and carefully drapes it across a bald pate
i lived in a little bungalow on napa street
the place was ok i guess it had an electric ice box gas hearth and a garbage grinder build into the sink
you might say i had it made
we float slowly toward a white bungalow on a quiet street as a black coupe pulls into the driveway
there was one other thing
we track in through a bedroom door to discover a woman putting on a girdle
doris kept the books at nirdlingers a small department store on main street
unlike me doris liked the work accounting she liked knowing where everything stood
and she got a ten per cent employee discount on whatever she wanted nylon stockings
close on her legs as she rolls up a stocking and clips it to the garter
make up and perfume
close on an atomiser misting her bosom with jungle gardenia by tuvache
she wore a lot of perfume
doris in a flouncy dress is setting coasters on a coffee table
doriss boss big dave brewster was married to ann nirdlinger the department store heiress
tonight they were coming over for dinner as doris said we were entertaining
ed sits on the living room davenport in an uncomfortable suit smoking
me i dont like entertaining
the doorbell rings
ed opens it to reveal a large man in a suit and his demure bird like wife
how ya doin ed
take your coat ann
the two couples are in the middle of the meal
japs had us pinned down in buna for something like six weeks
well i gotta tell ya i thought we had it tough but jesus we had supply
they were eating grubs nuts thistles
when we finally up and bust off the beach we found arnie bragg kid missing on recon the japs had eaten the sonofabitch if youll pardon the uh
and this was a scrawny pimply kid too nothin to write home about
i mean i never wouldve ya know so what do i say honey
when i dont like dinner what do i say
ann smiles wanly
i say jesus honey arnie bragg again
he roars with laughter
ed gives an acknowledging smile
arnie bragg again
he dries his eyes with the corner of a napkin
were you in the service ed
no dave i wasnt
ed was f on account of his fallen arches
mm thats tough
ed is standing alone on the porch watching the sun go down
from inside the house we hear laughter and clattering dishes
i guess doris liked all that he man stuff
sometimes i had the feeling that she and big dave were a lot closer than they let on
he turns and looks through the screen door into the house
across the dim living room we can see a sliver of the brightly lit kitchen
big dave wearing a frilly apron stands at the counter drying dishes
his broad back heaves with laughter while doris just hidden by the wall chats away handing dishes across
the signs were all there plain enough not that i was gonna prance about it mind you
its a free country
footsteps approach the front porch
with the squeak of the screen door big dave emerges
holding down the porch area
ed gives a half grin of wry acknowledgement
big dave relaxes forearms against the porch railing gazing out at the front lawn
thats quite a wife you got there
shes a rare one
hows business dave
couldnt be better
thesere boom times in retailing
were opening another store big daves annex there on garson
this is strictly haberdashery casual wear pyjamas ladies foundations and undergarments
matter of fact im thinking of making doris the comptroller
howre things at the uh the barbershop
all right i guess
well you might want to drop by the annex when we open update your suit course youre in the smock all day
say where do you get those things anyway
specialty store down in sacramento
there is a silence
at length gazing out at the lawn big dave clears his throat
doris and i went to church once a week
we are tilting down a long stained glass window depicting the resurrection of christ
usually tuesday night
faintly we hear an amplified voice i
ed sits at a long table staring at the window a lit cigarette in his mouth
doris wasnt big on divine worship
doris is concentrating on the six cards spread in front of her
and i doubt if she believed in life everlasting shed most likely tell you that our reward is on this earth and bingo is probably the extent of it
still focused on her cards doris mutters to ed watch your card honey
ed continues to gaze off at the window smoke pluming from his cigarette
i wasnt crazy about the game but i dont know it made her happy and i found the setting peaceful
doris sucks in her breath
jesus bingo bingo
sun slants in through the big window at the end of the day
ed sweeps hair trimmings looking intently down at the floor a cigarette dangling from his lip
frank sits on one of the vinyl waiting chairs talking at eds back
so you tie your own flies ed
i mean if youre really serious
you tie your own flies you do a i know its matickless i know people say hey you can buy flies at the store but you can buy your fish
at the store ed you see what im saying
the point is theres a certain art to the process
the point is not merely to provide and let me point out these fish are not as dumb as you might think
thats my point
june fly ed
which of these
well what fish do you seek
sure go to the store
go there describe to the man where you will be fishing and for what and the weather conditions sun no sun whatnot and so forth and then you might as
well have the man go ahead and sell you the goddamn fish ed
we see a black suited figure approaching through the windows at the far end of the shop
he is almost blown out by the late day sunlight hitting the window
my point is this is a man who knows nothing no matter how much you tell him so sell him the goddamn fish ed
the bell over the front door tinkles and the swarthy middle aged man walks in
he is well dressed perhaps a little too snazzily for this small town and has a sporty pencil mustache
ok boys which of you gets the privilege
were just closing friend
oh happy days
i wish i was doing well enough to turn away business
more power to ya brother
the public be damned
hey whats your problem friend
this is a business establishment with posted hours ed cuts in with a jerk of the head
ill take care of him go ahead frank
have a seat mister
frank looks sourly at the stranger
you sure eddie
yeah yeah go home
as frank leaves in your ear mister
the stranger chuckles
oh those fiery mediterraneans
not so fast there brother ed has switched on the clippers but the stranger waves him back he lifts off a toupee
pretty good huh
fools even the experts
percent human hair handcrafted by jacques of san francisco and id hate to have to tell you what i paid for it
yes its a nice rug
im paying for it down on the installment plan
ed starts to trim the strangers fringe
a lot of folks live with the pate exposed
they say the dames think its sexy
but for my money its just not good grooming and grooming my friend is probably the most important thing in business after personality of course
he twists around to offer his hand
creighton tolliver pleased to know ya
what brings you to santa rosa
a goose friend
i was chasing a wild goose
ed have you ever heard of venture capital
uh well its the wildest goose there is
except ed in certain situations its not see
i thought i had a prospect here
well i make the haul up and this lousy so and so tells me his situation has changed all his capitals gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his
thank you mother
pop goes another bubble
its only the biggest business opportunity since henry ford and i cant seem to interest a soul
its called dry cleaning
you heard me right brother dry cleaning wash without water no suds no tumble no stress on the clothes
its all done with chemicals friend and your garments end up crisp and fresh
and heres the capper no shrinkage
dry cleaning remember the name
its going to revolutionize the laundry industry and those that get in early are gonna bear the fruit away
all i need is to open my first store then i use its cash flow to finance another and so on leap frog bootstrap myself a whole chain
well me and a partner
theres money in it
theres a future
theres room to grow
say thats looking pretty good
lets see it with the hairpiece on
it is evening
ed leans against the bathroom doorjamb contemplatively off hands thrust into his pockets a cigarette between his lips pluming smoke
the reverse show doris soaking in the tub reading a magazine
was i crazy to be thinking about it
was he a huckster or opportunity the real mccoy
ed takes the cigarette from his mouth exhales
my first instinct was no no the whole idea was nuts
but maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop nose against the exit afraid to try turning the knob
what if i could get the money
she lifts one leg and rests the heel on the rim of the tub
shave my legs will ya
ed saunters over perches on the tub and puts the cigarette back in his mouth to free his hands
he picks up a bar of soap and starts soaping the leg
he sets down the soap and picks up a safety razor
the razor takes long slow strokes along the lather dark bits of hair flecking the white foam
it was clean
he shakes the razor in the tub
shavings float away across the soap slicked water
absently as she reads gimme a drag
ed pulls the cigarette from his mouth between two fingers uses the two fingers to flip it over and holds it for doris as she sucks
he brings the cigarette now marked with lipstick back to his own mouth
she murmurs love ya honey
we hear a voice muffled through the door breaking into laughter
a hand enters to knock
yeah come in
the door swings open to show creighton in his shirtsleeves sitting on the bed talking on the phone
a tray of room service dishes sits near him
he is bald his hairpiece sits on the pillow next to him
into the phone ok
ill see you tomorrow
he hangs up looks quizzically at ed
oh i thought you were the porter
can i help you
ed stands awkwardly by the door
im uh ed
the strangers look does not show recognition
sorry friend i uh you got me at a disadvantage
im uh im the barber
ill be a sonofagun
why didnt you say so
course the barber
ed nods his smile faint and forced
i didnt recognize you without the smock

i might be interested in that uh business proposition creighton surprised quickly picks up his hairpiece and arranges it on his head
you got the dough
i can get it yeah

whats involved aside from putting up the money
whatre you looking for the partner to do
well youll want to keep tabs on your investment of course but im looking for a silent partner

and how do we share fifty fifty straight down the line

ill have it in a week
well ill be damned
and i thought this trip was a bust
he reaches for a bottle of bonded whiskey on the night stand and hands ed a glass
it just goes to show when one door slams shut another one opens
heres to ya uh
they both knock back the whiskey
creighton leans back and gives ed a heavy lidded stare a faint smile on his lips his hairpiece slightly askew
ed stares back
after a beat without taking his eyes of ed creighton reaches up and loosens his tie
an almost imperceptible wink
was that a pass
youre out of line mister
creighton throws up his hands apologetically
way out of line
it says a hand pulls the note out of a typewriter carriage
i sent it to dave the next morning
and i waited
we are looking down at the top of an eight year olds crew cut as clippers buzz its perimeter
frank reads a magazine
the youngster reads a comic as ed works his head
you ever wonder about it
i dont know
how it keeps on coming
it just keeps growing
yeah lucky for us huh pal
no i mean its growing its part of us
and we cut it off
and throw it away
come on eddie youre gonna scare the kid
ed shuts off the clippers and give the apron a flap
ok bud youre through
the kid hops down still reading his comic and ambles out the door
ed gives frank a considering stare
im gonna take his hair and throw it out in the dirt
what the im gonna mingle it with common house dirt
what the hell are you talking about
ed turns back to the counter to hang up his clippers
i dont know
it is twilight
ed lifts the latch on the front gate and cigarette in his mouth heads up the walk
music filters out from the house
ed walks though the living room hands in his pockets
the music emanates from a radio in the bedroom
a track forward reveals doris sitting at a vanity doing her hair
her dress is half zipped at the back
gimme a zip
ed walks over behind her
where you going
the party at nirdlingers i told you last week for the christmas push
we are close on the zipper as eds hand takes the tab pauses the lowers it slightly
her back blooms through the dark fabric of the dress
he slides the zipper up and doris reaches for a perfume atomizer
come on get ready
nah go ahead
im not big on parties
oh dont be a grump
it is festooned with streamers
ed leans against a wall one hand dug into a pocket the other bringing a cigarette to his lips
band music plays and nirdlingers employees whirl on the dance floor
bobby soxed teenagers lindy hop and pass palms over their knees
a thin young man in a sports coat stands next to ed watching his adams apple bobbing
he goes out onto the dance floor
ed left by himself gazes across the floor
his view broken by dancers crosses shows big dave worriedly talking to doris
doris reacts angrily
big dave morosely absorbs the angry words from doris
he glances up toward ed and notices his gaze with consternation
he gives doris a jerk of the head and she too looks over
you in ladies wear
the young man with the adams apple is back looking out at the floor snapping his fingers
havent i seen you up in ladies wear
i dont work here
my wife does
some beat huh
check out the rack on that broad in the angora
a hand is laid on eds shoulder
it is big dave he leans in to murmur ed
can i talk to you
music from the party drifts in only faintly
the office is built into a corner of the sales floor
it is dominated by a large desk
a large window on the far side affords a partial view of the floor
ed sits in a leather chair in front of the desk
dave fumbles nervously on top of the desk for a cigar
he trims the end of the cigar with a short double bladed knife with a steel grip
souveniered it off a jap in new guinea
he hands one cigar to ed takes one for himself then drags up a chair to face eds
i guess youre wondering what doris was so hot about
the office is dark the only illumination coming from the window onto the bright sales floor behind big dave
ed leans forward for dave to light his cigar
romeo and juliets
dave having lit eds cigar draws nervously on his own
what is it dave
dave breaks down weeping
he buries his face in his hands the burning cigar in his right hand perilously close to his hair
ed ive been weak
his shoulders heave
ed has taken daves cigar so that he wont burn himself
ive been carrying on with a married woman
uh no one you know
and now the uh what is it they say
the the the chickens are coming home to roost
ed awkwardly holds the two burning cigars
hell i im not proud of it
but uh thats not the worst of it
i got a note
a blackmail note
you know come across or everybody knows
well you know what that would do to me
i guess it would be pretty awkward
annd throw me out on my keister
hell its her familys store her store
i serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership ed
i only work here
and the ladys husband would know
how much to they want dave
i dont know what to do ed
i dont know what i can do
even though i know who the sonofabitch is
who who is
its uh its no one you know
its a businessman from sacramento
a goddamn pansy ed
he tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme i heard him out and then told him to go to hell
and the very next day the very next day ed i get blackmailed for the same amount
it sounds pretty obvious
well i guess he dont care that its obvious
how did he know that hes staying at the hotel ive gone to with uh with the lady in question
mustve seen us
big dave blows his nose reaches to take his cigar from ed
he exhales with a long sigh
why dont you just pay him dave
thats my capitalization on the annex
my operation ed
thats what i was just talking to doris about a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from ann
from my own goddamn wife
he give a tearful chuckle
doris she was pretty hot about that
god bless her
she doesnt know im telling you this shes mad enough already
but jesus ed youre the only one i can talk to
im im sorry i
i better get back to the party
he rises and clears his throat as he rubs the tears from his face
i look all right
he has left the office to wander through an adjacent room lit only by spill from the party
it is the music department pianos and spinets are arranged across the floor
in a way i felt bad for big dave
i knew the ten grand was going to pinch him where it hurt
ed sits on a piano stool next to a standing ashtray
he takes out a cigarette lights it off his cigar stubs out the cigar
but doris was two timing me and i guess somewhere that pinched a little too
his attention is caught by a distant knock of wood
someone is raising the key guard on a piano across the room
the person can only be seen only obscurely from three quarters behind through the sales floors jumble of haphazardly arranged instruments
the person begins to play
the piece is slow sweet almost a lullaby
the player unaware that there is an audience plays on and ed listens eyes narrowed against the smoke curling past his face
the piece ends
that was pretty
the player turns surprised
it is a young woman
did you make that up
that was written by mr ludwig van beethoven
ed nods recognition of the name
that was quite something
he wrote some beautiful piano sonatas
that was something
im ed crane
i know who you are mr crane
his look shows surprise
my father used to take me with him when he got his hair cut
eds head tilts back in acknowledgment
im rachel abundas
everyone calls me birdy
sorry i just didnt remember
oh thats all right
you cant be expected to remember every skinny girl who comes in with her dad
ed give a wry smile
you dont like the music out there
its ok i guess
no i dont really
im not big on music ordinarily
a woman calls sharply from offscreen ed
silhouetted in the doorway to the party room is doris coat over her arm purse in hand
doris and ed are driving home
doris draws heavily on a cigarette looking flintily out at the road
what a knucklehead
she waves angrily
hes thinking about canceling the annex
that means i dont run nirdlingers
they ride in silence for a beat
doris shakes her head
what a knucklehead
as the car roars past and into the distance
it is day
we are looking from inside a parked car toward a hotel entrance
big dave emerges from the hotel gets into a packard and drives off
big dave did it though
ed sitting in his car is watching
i sent a note telling him where to drop the money
ed emerges from a stairwell and goes to a standing ashtray by the elevator
and he did
he came across
ed reaches into the trash hole in the ashtray column and pulls out a nirdlingers bag
he goes back to the stairwell
ed emerges from the stairwell goes to a door and knocks
the door swings open
yeah good how are ya come in
ed follows him into the room
you bring a check
he gives ed a look
usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft
but cash thats fine its all the same in the end doughs dough huh
i got the paperwork here
partnership papers here they reflect our agreement fifty fifty on the net i supply professional services you supply the capital
ill give you a receipt on the dough there huh
pretty straightforward but i dont know if you wanna show this stuff to a lawyer its ok
yeah screw em huh
pay em to tangle it up and then you pay em to untangle it whats the point
he perspires as he counts the money
just a second here ill give you a receipt on the uh
oh by the way we didnt talk about this i uh i think im gonna call the place tollivers after me you know i didnt think you were much interested
in uh thatll be fine

he wipes his brow finishes counting
yeah thats it
as per our discussion
creighton hands ed an executed agreement and a receipt
well there it is
writ large in legal escriture next step is look uh
he gives creighton a level stare smoke pluming from the cigarette planted in his mouth
youre not gonna screw me on this
screw you jesus
take it to a lawyer
no i insist
this is dry cleaning this is not some fly by night thing here
i must say ive been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and ive never all right
and ive never been asked look you want the dough back
you know who i am
you creighton mops his brow again
tollivers is ok then
ed drives with the usual cigarette in his mouth
doris sits next to him
rural scenery slips by in the background
the next day was saturday
we were going to a reception for doris cousin gina whod just married a wop vintner out near modesto
doris didnt much feel like going and i didnt either but like she said we had a commitment
doris gazes stonily out at the road
at length i hate wops
ed gives her a brief glance
doris glares at him
whats so damn strange about that
i didnt say a word
she looks back out at the road
you didnt have to grow up with em
this brings nothing from ed
doris shakes her head
wops in sunday clothing greet each other around tables piled with food
a small child runs up to his mother yanks on her dress and screams hes ridin garibaldi
uncle frankies ridin garibaldi
surrounded by cheering children with a jug of wine slung over his shoulder frank is riding an enormous pig
he slaps at the pigs ass with a large straw hat
that was when she started drinking
doris is standing by one of the tables drinking red wine from a water glass
ed stands nearby
a large woman hugs doris
how you doin doris you been ok
howre you constanza
oh you know i got my healt
and how you been uh
hows a business
to doris hes a barber right
its a good trade
so how come you got no kids
a group of kids pulls frank laughing by the hand toward a picnic table set out with pies in a row
uncle frankies gotta join
wait for frankie
no come on kids i just ate lunch
no no uncle frankies gotta join
an old man stands by with a stopwatch
he clicks the timer
frank and the line of children plunge their faces into the line of blueberry pies
the other picnickers cheer them on
ed and doris approach the innocent looking young couple accepting congratulations
doris holding her empty glass is not a happy drunk gratulations gina
its so goddamn wonderful
life is so goddamn wonderful you almost wont believe it
its just a goddamn bowl of cherries im sure
ed tries to lead her away
doris calls back over her shoulder congratulations on your goddamn cherries
as ed and doris recede we hear her petulant leggo my goddamn elbow
in a long shot we see frank at the crest of a hill staggering slowly painfully toward a tree
in his right hand he clutches a trophy
when he reaches the tree he swings his free hand up against it leans forward and vomits
late afternoon driving home
doris sits in the front passenger seat snoring lightly
frank sits in the back seat hugging his trophy to his chest eyes closed murmuring i never wanna see another blueberry pie
i never even wanna hear those words
dont says those words ed
it is twilight
eds coupe is parked in the driveway
he is just rounding the back of the car to open the passenger side door
he pulls doris from the car half asleep half drunk
the door swings open and ed stumbles in supporting doris who has one arm draped around his neck
he helps her into the bedroom and eases her onto the bed
he sits on the edge of the bed and looks down at her
shadows from branches just outside wave across her face
she is breathing through her open mouth her face is moist with perspiration
id met doris blind on a double date with a loudmouthed buddy of mine who was seeing a friend of hers from work
we went to a movie doris had a flask we killed it
she could put it away
at the end of the night she said she liked it i didnt talk much
a couple weeks later she suggested a harsh jangle from the telephone
doris moans but does not wake ed rises and does to the living room and picks up the phone
ed its big dave
i gotta talk to you
im at nirdlingers
let yourself in
he hangs up
he nudges doris
she rolls away and burrows into a pillow
ed opens her purse and pokes through it
we are looking over eds shoulder as he hesitantly swings open a door
it reveals big daves office quiet and rather dark
a down facing bankers lamp on the desk illuminates big daves hands on the desktop
come on in
ed enters sits
an awkward silence
whats the problem big dave
his hands writhe on the desktop
it ruined me
im all shot to hell
so you paid the guy
big dave stares without speaking
after a long beat what kind of man are you
what kind of man are you
big dave id understand if youd walked in here
socked me in the nose
i deserved it
im not proud of what i did
no one talks
big dave sighs
yeah i paid up
as you well know
and then i went and found the pansy
he looks at ed
got nothin to say huh
yeah well you already know the story
i didnt i hadda beat it out of the pansy
what kind of man are you
big dave rises
he crosses around the desk and adds sadly im all shot to hell
ed starts to rise but big dave is already looming over him
big dave bear hugs him and then spins him into a wall
ed hits the wall and bounces off back into big dave
big dave wallops him in the stomach
ed doubles over
what kind of man are you
big dave hurls him against the desk then slams his face against the desktop
eds hands scrabble at the top of the desk as big dave grabs him by the neck and lifts
he slams him face first into the window between the office and the dark sales floor
ed twists around the back of his head now pressed against the glass
big daves hands lock around his throat
big dave sweats and strains
a crack shoots up the pane of glass
eds hand sweeps up and plunges something into big daves neck
big dave grunts and turns away gurgling
his hands go up to his throat
he is holding big daves cigar trimmer
big dave takes a couple of deliberate steps backward his head twisted away
he falls back tripped up by a chair which spins him face down onto the floor
big dave crawls away face down across the floor on his knees but with his hands still at his throat
his face and knees awkwardly support his weight as if he were pushing something across the floor with his nose
he reaches a corner but still pushes forward wedging himself in legs still scraping away as if to push himself through the wall
blood is pooling out from under him
big daves legs are still working
his gurgling continues
big daves legs start to move furiously
his whole body shakes as he goes into shock
big dave stops shaking
he remains wedged awkwardly into the corner face down
he is still
the room is very quiet
ed looks down at his hands
he walks across the room pushes the door open and walks across the darkened sales floor
ed walks to his car
he does not look about is not particularly furtive
he gets into the car
he starts the ignition
he pulls up sits motionless for a beat
gradually something draws his attention he cocks his head and looks up through the windshield
a branch creaks and sways in the breeze
ed gets into bed next to doris
he stares at the ceiling
wind rustles outside
the shadow of a branch on the ceiling nods in time with the wind
he looks at doris
her face is still lightly sheened with sweat but her mouth is closed now her breathing more peaceful
the leafy shadows play over her face
it was only a couple of weeks after we met that doris suggested getting married
i said dont you wanna get to know me more
she said why does it get better
she looked at me like i was a dope which ive never really minded from her
and she had a point i guess
we knew each other as well then as now
he is gazing at her
anyway well enough
sound and image face
the next day
ed cuts hair a cigarette between his lips
holy moly do i got a headache
frank is giving a haircut as well
how you today ed
you dont got a headache
damn i got a headache to beat the band
ed sits in his chair hands folded in his lap head tilted back eyes closed
we hold on ed as we hear a clipper buzzing and frank talking to someone in his chair
ya cant pump it
did ya pump it
thatll just flood it
ya gotta pump it
ya cant just hold it down
thatll flood it
you pumped it
well ya cant hold it down
there is the jingle of the door bell
ed opens his eyes
two men in fedoras are entering
ed starts to rise
come on outside
the two men are staring at the sidewalk smoking hesitant to speak
one of them finally comes up with an icebreaker so youre a barber huh
im officer persky
this is krebs
ed nods toward their car we goin
ed holds up one hand with its smoking cigarette
petes got some news for you
his partner gives persky a dirty look

ed stares at him
yeah its a tough break
visiting ends at five
too late today
you can see her tomorrow
they sent us to tell ya
he shakes his head
it is evening
ed is pulling up to a house on a tree lined street similar to his own
he gets out of his car and goes up the walk and a man sitting on the porch swing holds up a hand of greeting
he steps up on the porch
the man is holding a tumbler of whiskey and ice that clinks as the swing moves
his skin glistens with drinkers sweat and he has the slightly expansive manner of someone whos put at least a couple away
have a seat
ed glances around but the swing is the only seat
he sits next to walter
thanks for seeing me at home

and i hear theyre bringing a prosecutor up from sacramento
taking it seriously
so taking it seriously

ed rises and they awkwardly shake hands

they watch her go back in
shes a good kid
so uh who should i well theres lloyd garroway in san francisco

he takes a sip of his drink

out of sacramento
course i dont know how youre fixed for money
hes the uh
yeah the best
wish i could tell you more
hell i wish i could handle it myself
but id be absolutely worthless for this kind of thing
he takes a musing sip
no question about it
it is a long table with chairs stretching down both sides one side for prisoners the other for visitors
the room is empty except for a guard and an elderly woman who sits across from a younger woman at the far end of the table
the younger woman in a prison smock is wailing
the elderly woman is holding her hand
ed sits across from an empty chair clutching a flower printed toiletries kit
there are echoing voices suggesting large spaces outside the room
he sits and waits
the door opens
a large prison matron steps aside to let doris enter
doris looks lost in a prison issue jumper that is too big for her
her hair is uncurled and bedraggled
not only is she not made up she has a couple of bruises and a cut on her lip
as ed stands she gives a hollow look around
i brought your make up
she looks at him
how are you
i dont know whats going on
i what happened to you
she shakes her head
i dont know what happened to big dave
i know some of it
irregularities in my books they said
can i explain it
you dont have to i helped him cook the books ed
i did do that
you dont have to tell them anything
were getting you a lawyer
doris doesnt seem to be listening
she sighs i know all about that
but i dont know how much to tell them
dont tell em anything
were getting you freddy riedenschneider
doris finally looks at him
should i tell you why
you dont have to tell me anything
her gaze drifts away again
she notices the sobbing woman
doris looks around and laughs
my books used to be perfect
anyone could open them up make sense of the whole goddamn store
i knew wed pay for it
ed sits in a waiting customer chair wearing his smock
frank paces in front of him
he smacks a fist into his palm
this is what family is for ed
this is when ya come together
those sons of bitches
frank uh you know ill try to contribute but uh freddy riedenschneider i dont care what it costs
this is when ya come together
thats very generous
the hell with it eddie
ed and frank sit waiting on a bench in the high vaulted lobby
frank looks uncomfortable in an ill fitting suit
as they wait he looks nervously about
in a hushed voice theyre just people like you and me ed
they gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money
this is why the big lobby ed
but they put their pants on one leg at a time
just like you and me
they too use the toilet ed
in spite of appearances
and their money will be secured by the barbershop
a rock the barbershop
i mean how long has this place been here
a door opens
a conservatively dressed man of late middle age emerges
frank hops to his feet
could you come with me please
can ed come too
the man looks dubiously at ed
you also have an interest in the securing property
hes a barber
not an owner
no hes family hes my brother in law
it would be best if he waited here
he goes to the glass paned doorway to his office frank trailing dejectedly behind
they enter the door closes and we hear their muffled voices from inside the sense of the words lost
ed sits and watches the two men perform their pantomime of business frank nervously reads documents with one hand cupped to his forehead for concentration the banker passes successive documents
across his desk with a word of explanation for each as frank signs
ed takes out a cigarette and lights it watching impassively
doris and franks father had worked thirty years to own it free and clear
now it got signed over to the bank and the bank signed some money over to frank and frank signed the money over
it is midday
we are tracking along the sidewalk toward a long cream colored packard parked at the curb
a couple of kids have stopped to peer into the cars windows the car is no doubt the fanciest in town
to freddy riedenschneider who got into town two days later
ed coming up the sidewalk looks up at the storefront a restaurant with a large window with a plush red drape that obscures the interior
gilt lettering on the window spells out davincis
and told me to meet him at davincis for lunch
inside the restaurant
we are tracking toward a table whose lone occupant sits with his back to us holding open a menu as he orders from a facing waitress not fried poached
three of em for two minutes
a strip steak medium rare flapjacks potatoes tomato juice and plenty of hot coffee
he flips the menu over
do you have prairie oysters
then bring me a fruit cocktail while i wait
he looks up at ed
youre ed crane
yeah barber right
im freddy riedenschneider
they tell me the chows ok here
i made some inquiries
no thanks i the waitress sets a fruit cocktail in front of riedenschneider
look i dont wanna waste your time so ill eat while we talk

everythings out of school

any questions give me a ring turandot suite if im out leave a message
you sure you dont want anything
he points a finger at ed
youre ok pal
youre ok shes ok
everythings gonna be hunky dory
the waitress puts down a plate of steak and eggs
and the flapjacks honey
we are looking at pedestrians on the sidewalk through the windshield of a moving car
all going about their business
it seemed like i knew a secret a bigger one even then what had really happened to big dave something none of them knew
on ed driving
like i had made it to the outside somehow and they were all still struggling way down below
arms folded behind his head staring at the ceiling
on the ceiling is the moving shadow of a tree limb
a distant muffled knock
ed turns his head
ed opens it as he finishes cinching a bathrobe
the woman waiting on the front porch is dressed in black a black dress and a black veiled hat that is too big for her bird like frame
wind rustles in the trees behind her
she stares at ed
for the first time we hear her speak in a low tremulous voice hello ed
will you come in
she shakes her head
no no its very late
after an uncomfortable beat through which she continues to stare im so sorry about your loss
of course you know doris had nothing to do with it
nothing at all
she lays a black gloved hand on his arm
oh i know
dont worry ed
i came to tell you
and you should tell doris
she falls silent
the trees behind her rustle
she gives a wary look back
then confidingly to ed you know how big dave loved camping
and the out of doors
ed is puzzled yes
we went camping last summer
in eugene oregon
outside of eugene ed
she gives him a searching look hoping it seems that he will find this significant
at night there were lights we both saw them
we never told anyone outside of our official report
ann a spacecraft
i saw the creatures
they led big dave onto the craft
he never told anyone what they did outside of his report
of course he told me
no one else
ann the government knows
i cannot repeat it to you
but this thing goes deep ed
this was not your wife
i goes deep and involves the government
there is a great deal of fear
you know how certain circles would find it the knowledge a threat
they try to limit it and ann will you come in sit down maybe have a drink
sometimes knowledge is a curse ed
after this happened things changed
he never touched me again
ed says nothing
she touches his arm
tell doris not to worry
i know it wasnt her
perhaps this will bring it out finally
perhaps now it will all come out
she turns and heads down the walk
her high heeled footsteps echo on the walk then the sidewalk then are lost in the rustle of leaves
ed watches her go a small black figure growing smaller
it is an unadorned room with a simple wooden table and chairs
one high window lets in a shaft of sunlight
ed and doris sit at the table freddy riedenschneider stands to one side staring up at the high window hands dug into his pockets
all three are motionless for a long beat
finally it stinks
but its true
i dont care its true its not true it stinks
you say he was being blackmailed by who
you dont know
for having an affair with who
you dont know
did anyone else know about it
probably not you dont know
i knew about it
big dave told me about it and the spot he was putting himself in by getting the money
your husband backs you up
he starts pacing
youve gotta give me something to work with
freddy riedenschneider is good but hes not a magician
he cant just wave his little wand in the air and make a plausible defense materialize
look at what the other side is gonna run at us
they got the company books prepared by you cooked by you thats motive
they got a murder scene you had access to
they got that little trimmer thing he was stabbed in the throat with a dames weapon it was big daves
dont interrupt me thats means
they got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim and then they got you a disgruntled number juggling underling who on the day in question was
drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home alone
i was with her
riedenschneider gives him a hard look
like i say it stinks
another long pause
i killed him
riedenschneider eyes him
wheels start turning
ok we forget the blackmail
you killed him
he and doris
were having an affair
doris eyes him
his manner does not reveal anything
ok how did you know
a husband knows
riedenschneider rolls his eyes
will anyone else say they knew
i dont know
i dont think so
how did you get into the store
i took doriss keys
will anyone say they saw you there
on your way there
on your was back
i dont think so
will anyone corroborate and goddamn part of your story at all
ed returns riedenschneiders stare
riedenschneider resumes pacing
come on people
you cant help each other like that
lets be realistic now
lets look at our options
well frankly i dont see any options
a nod of the head indicates doris i cannot present story a
another nod indicates ed i cannot present story b
i could plead you for a nutcase but you look too composed
i could offer a guilty plea and in return they dont give you the juice but i dont think you want to spend the rest of your life in chino
and i know you didnt hire freddy riedenschneider to hold your hand at a sentencing hearing
hell you couldve gotten lloyd garroway for that
no were not giving up yet you hired freddy riedenschneider it means youre not throwing in the towel
i litigate i dont capitulate
all right no options we gotta think
all right we go back to the blackmail thing
it titillates its open ended
his pacing becomes more animated
and it makes him the bad guy ya dig around ya never know something unsavory from his past he approaches you to help with the money its too late his
past comes back to haunt him whos to say
he is heading for the door
forget the jealous husband thing thats silly were going with the blackmail
ill be in touch
the door slams
the camera drifts in toward the reception desk
ed talks to the clerk behind the desk but the scene plays silently we hear only eds narration
of course there was one person who could confirm doriss story or plenty of it the dry cleaning pansy
the desk clerk is shaking his head
but hed left the hotel skipped out on his bill
it is a rooming house hallway
a stern middle aged woman is on the hall telephone
this too plays silently under the narration
hed also disappeared from the residence he gave me
we are drifting in toward ed who nods at the telephone and then cradles it
he stares down at the business card he holds
owing two months rent
how could i have been so stupid
for a piece of paper
and the man gone
like a ghost
in a different living room
he sits on a sofa hands clasped behind his head listening
for the first time as the voice over continues we hear atmosphere from the scene piano music
disappeared into thin air vaporized like the nips at nagasaki
the money gone
big dave gone
how could i have been so stupid
the continuing pull back reveals walter abundas on a nearby chair also listening as birdy plays
walter holds a drink in one hand he is nodding his eyelids droop
as the piano piece reaches its mournful conclusion his chin alights on his chest his eyelids tremble closed and he starts lightly to snore
the distinctive buzz of electric hairclippers bangs in at the cut
ed and frank stand behind their respective chairs administering haircuts
the customer in eds chair is in white shirtsleeves that do not hide rolls of fat
he has a hot towel over his face that does not slow his speech although it does muffle it to some extent she makes this stuff she calls it gatto
its got egg in there its got sugar its got its cake basically except she calls it gatto
like if you dont call it cake maybe you wont put on any weight like i need to eat gatto you know what im saying
this stuff if ive had a square meal ive had my steak and potatoes i can just have another cup of coffee afterward i wont ask for the desert if
its not there
his voice turns into a drone under the narration
sooner or later everyone needs a haircut
got the recipe from a magazine womans magazine
we were working for the bank now
we kept cutting the hair trying to stay afloat make the payments tread water day by day day by day
inside a courtroom we boom down toward the defendants table the fat customers drone turning into the drone of the bailiff reading an indictment
doris stands next to freddy riedenschneider
most people think someones accused of a crime they haul em in and bring em to trial but its not like that its not that fast
the wheels of justice turn slow
did willfully and with malice aforethought take the life of one david allen brewster a human being
they have an arraignment and then the indictment and they entertain motions to dismiss and postpone and change the venue and alter this and that and the other
they empanel a jury which brings more motions and they set a trial date and then change the date and then often as not theyll change it again
what say you to these charges
our boom down has ended close on doris
we hear freddy riedenschneider off we plead not guilty your honor
booming down toward the fat man
and through all of it we cut the hair
i say honey if youre gonna make a cobbler make a little bit of cobbler dont put a whole pan in front of me and tell me its not gonna
be any good when its cold
we are panning photographic portraits of opera singers in character wearing the wardrobe of different eras armies dukedoms and boudoirs and displaying the heights and depths of various emotions their
mouths stretched wide in song
we pan off the pictures to discover that we are in a hotel room floating in toward a bed on which freddy riedenschneider a mask over his eyes slumbers
meanwhile freddy riedenschneider slept at the metropole
tracking in toward freddy riedenschneider who sits twirling spaghetti with a fork against a spoon
and shoveled it in at davincis
from inside a car
pedestrians bustle along a sidewalk
among them scurries a weedy little man who has one hand clamped to the crown of his hat to keep it in place in a stiff wind
hed brought in a private investigator from sacramento
moving the opposite way
a different day but again a crowd moves along the sidewalk and among them the little man scuttles in the opposite direction hand still raised to his hat his forearm
and the tilt of his head largely obscuring his face
to nose around into big daves past
in the abundas living room again again listening to birdy at the piano but now the two of them are alone
i found myself more and more going over to the abundass
it was a routine we fell into most every evening
i even went when walter was away on his research trips
he was a genealogist had traced back his side of the family seven generations his late wifes eight
it seemed like a screwy hobby
but then maybe all hobbies are
maybe walter found something there in the old county courthouses hospital file rooms city archives property rolls registries something maybe like what i found listening to birdy play
some kind of escape
some kind of peace
the piano music ends in a sustain which begins to fade but then is snapped by a sharp clang
we are pushing into the high windowed prison meeting room
none of its three occupants is moving
the tableau consists of doris staring down at the table the private investigator sitting on a straightbacked chair tipped back against a wall his arms folded across his chest his
fedora pushed back on his head a toothpick clamped between his teeth and freddy riedenschneider standing hands clasped behind his back gazing with a distant smile up into the shaft of light that slants through the high window
a warder shuts the door behind ed
doris and the private investigator turn to note his entrance riedenschneider does not
ed pulls out a chair across from doris clasps his hands on top of hers
she looks at his hands on top of hers
a long beat
still gazing up into the shaft of light freddy riedenschneider announces they got this guy in germany
fritz something or other
or is it
maybe its werner
anyway hes got this theory you wanna test something you know scientifically how the planets go round the sun what sunspots are made of why the water comes out of
the tap well you gotta look at it
but sometimes you look at it your looking changes it
ya cant know the reality of what happened or what wouldve happened if you hadden a stuck in your goddamn schnozz
so there is no what happened
not in any sense that we can grasp with our puny minds
because our minds
out minds get in the way
looking at something changes it
they call it the uncertainty principle
sure it sounds screwy but even einstein says the guys on to something
his gaze up at the window breaks
he strolls around the room still smiling
he stops to examine a bur on his fingernail
im sayin sometimes the more you look the less you really know
its a fact
a proved fact
in a way its the only fact there is
this heinie even wrote it out in numbers
he looks up at the private detective
with a slight weight shift burns tips his chair so that its front legs slap down onto the floor
he fishes a small notebook from an inside pocket
his boredom is profound his only concession to performance is to move the toothpick from one side of his mouth to the other where perhaps it will less inhibit speech
subject david allen brewster
father insurance salesman mother homemaker
one year case western university on football scholarship
retail appliance salesman in barnhoffs department store cincinnati
meets ann nirdlinger married later that year moves here
arrested on an assault complaint complainant an organizer for the ilgwu has a broken nose couple of ribs wifes family intercedes some kind of settlement charges dropped
another assault beef bar altercation yeah yeah couple of fistfights
go to his service record
burns looks at him sourly
he flips a couple of pages
inducted march assigned to fifth fleet us navy petty officer first class serves in clerical capacity in us naval shipyards in san diego one fistfight broken up by mps no
court martial honorable discharge may
since then hes been clean
riedenschneider nods smiling
thank you burns get lost
burns pockets his notebook adjusts his hat jams his hands into his pockets and ambles out of the room
the slam of the door leaves quiet
at length so
riedenschneiders fixed smile now fades
this could be your dollys ticket out of the deathhouse so
ed and doris look at each other
i dont get it
look chum this is a guy from what i understand told everybody he was a war hero right
island hopping practically liberated the pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of jap guts between his teeth
and now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in san diego
you asked for blackmail let me give you blackmail mr hale fellow well met about to open his own business here has been lying to everybody in this town for
the last four years probably including half the people sitting on that jury
well it finally caught up with him these dopes it always does someone threatened to spill it
somebody knew his dirty little secret just like your wife says
they called they demanded money
he is looking at doris
did big dave mention that it was something about his war service
i dont know i wasnt there youll have to tell us
maybe he specified maybe he didnt im not putting words in your mouth the point is that this liar this cynical manipulator this man who through his lies sneered and
belittled the sacrifice and heroism of all our boys who did serve and bleed and puke and die on foreign shores and who made a fool out of this entire town turns to you to help him out of his jam
fat assed sonofabitch
who actually who
i dont know who
but the point is that if mr prosecutor over there had devoted half the time hes spent persecuting this woman to even the most cursory investigation of this schmoes past
then we might know who
but we cant know what really happened
because of fritz or werner or whatever the hell his name is
and because me prosecutor is also a lazy fat assed sonofabitch who decided its easier to victimize your wife
because its easier not to look
because the more you look the less you know
but the beauty of it is we dont gotta know
we just gotta show that goddamnit they dont know
you explain it to me
he chuckles as he heads for the door
yeah freddy riedenschneider sees daylight
we got a real shot at this folks
lets not get cocky
the door shuts behind him
doris stares down at the table as at the head of the scene
a silent beat a smile starts to tug at the corners of her mouth
the smile twitches and then stays
doris starts to laugh
her laughter builds almost to hysteria
finally it subsides and still staring at the tabletop and smiling she shakes her head what a dope
ed sits listening as birdy plays
she talks after a moment her eyes on the sheet music he was deaf when he wrote this
he created it and yet he never actually heard it
i suppose he heard it all in his head somehow
over her continued playing so maybe riedenschneider could get doris off
maybe it would all work out
and i thought i hoped that maybe there was a way out for me as well
the cardboard sign on an easel says come one come all the girl had talent anyone could see that
and she wasnt some fly by nighter she was just a good clean kid
a young man holding a saxophone is just leaving the makeshift stage to a smattering of applause
birdy walks out to the baby grand that has been set out center stage
if she was going to have a career shed need a responsible adult looking out for her
we track up the rows of folding chairs that have been set out on the gym floor for the audience of students and parents many of whom fan themselves with
we come to rest on ed
some kind of
shed have contracts to look at be going on tours playing on the radio maybe
i could help her sort through all of that without charging her an arm and a leg just enough to get by
birdy begins to play for the quietly attentive audience
ed is among the crowd streaming from the gym into the warm summer night
he looks around the parking lot
i could afford to charge less than the usual manager not having to put up a big front like a lot of these phonies
and i could be with her enough to keep myself feeling a trace of a frown as he spots her leaning against a car laughing passing a cigarette back and
forth with another student a boy
why couldnt that work
birdys easy smile remains as ed approaches but the boys drops he puts on a face more suitable for meeting adults
hi mr crane
i thought that was very good
oh in there
i messed up a little bit in the scherzo
i guess if nobody noticed its ok
mr crane this is tony a friend of mine
tony mr crane
the teens wait for the adult to direct the conversation ed has nothing to say
at length he clears his throat
i guess ill be getting home
nice to meet you sir
it is morning
we are tracking past an unmade bed toward the bathroom where we hear water running
anyway thats what i was thinking about in the days leading up to the trial
it seemed like once that was over id be ready for a new start
freddy riedenschneider was very optimistic
he was busy preparing
we have rounded the open bathroom door to find riedenschneider hunched over the sink toothbrush in hand spitting out water
he rises looks at himself in the mirror sprinkles some tonic in his hair
and finally it came
the first day of the trial
riedenschneider runs his fingers through his hair
what riedenschneider called the big show
he straightens his tie gives his neck a twist
we are close on the back of riedenschneiders gleaming hair
he is sitting at the defense table
there is a murmur of a crowd that has yet to be called to order
wheres the judge
how come theres no judge
ed and frank sit next to each other in the first gallery row directly behind riedenschneider
wheres the judge ed
frank looks at riedenschneiders back
how come the judge doesnt come out
the judge comes in last
hell come in when doris gets here
so wheres doris
i thought we started at ten
hey riedenschneider wheres doris
riedenschneider is curt shes late
how can she be late
riedenschneider doesnt answer frank turns to ed
shes in prison ed
none of us are in prison and yet were not late
were on time ed
how can doris be late
what they dont have wake up calls
the murmur of the crowd subsides as a door behind the judges bench opens and the judge hurriedly enters
the gallery rises but the judge quickly waves them back down and rather than seating himself leans forward over his desk to give a peremptory beckoning wave to riedenschneider and
riedenschneider puzzled approaches the bench as does his counterpart from the other table
the judge still leaning forward speaks to them in a low voice that is not audible from the gallery
the crowd has started murmuring again also in hushed tones
frank leans in toward ed
whats going on ed
i thought there would be arguments
the bailiff and so forth
ed also puzzled is watching riedenschneider who suddenly stiffens
as the judge continues to talk riedenschneider looks back over his shoulder at ed
ed what is this
is this procedure
the two lawyers nod at the judge and walk back to their respective tables
the judge now summons a uniformed man standing to one side
as the judge and the bailiff confer riedenschneider looks down at his desk and for something to do straightens various papers
i dont understand
we had a real shot at it
we could have won this thing
the bailiff announces in the matter of the state of california versus doris crane case number assigned to this superior court
as the bailiff drones riedenschneider shakes his head
it doesnt make any sense
late afternoon sun slants in
the shop not open for business is very still
ed in his courtroom suit sits in one of the vinyl chairs that line the wall hunched forward forearms on his knees
frank also still in his suit is up in one of the barber chairs one hand cupped to his forehead weeping
shed hanged herself
id brought her a dress to wear to court and shed used the belt
i didnt understand it either
at first i thought maybe it had something to do with me that shed figured out somehow how i fit into it and couldnt stand it couldnt stand knowing
ed is in bed staring at the ceiling
that wasnt it i would find out later
for now everything just seemed ruined
riedenschneider is at the cashiers desk checking out
behind him a bellmans cart is piled high with his bags
freddy riedenschneider went back to sacramento still shaking his head saying it was the biggest disappointment of his professional career
frank sits at his kitchen table staring in a bathrobe thrown over his pyjamas unshaven
frankie fell to pieces
i suspect he was drinking anyway he stopped coming to work
ed in his smock works on a customer
that left me to keep the place going or the bank wouldve taken it
as he uses the electric clippers a cigarette plumes between his lips
he squints against the smoke drifting past his eyes
i was the principal barber now
i hired a new man for the second chair
eds former chair is indeed being manned by a newcomer a gangly young man who animatedly chats up his customer
id hired the guy who did the least gabbing when he came in for an interview
but i guess the new man had only kept quiet because he was nervous once he had the job he talked from the minute i opened the shop in the
it is evening
ed is locking the barbershop as next to him on the sidewalk the new man continues to chat gesticulating to illustrate his store
until i locked up at night
for all i know he talked to himself on the way home
ed walks along the sidewalk
when i walked home it seemed like everyone avoided looking at me
indeed none of the passers by establish eye contact their averted eyes make the crowd a faceless throng
as if id caught some disease
this thing with doris nobody wanted to talk about it it was like i was a ghost walking down the street
as ed lets himself in
and when i got home now the place felt empty
he sits on the couch and after a beat takes a cigarette pack from his pocket and taps out a smoke
i sat in the house but there was nobody there
i was a ghost i didnt see anyone no one saw me
ed is in his smock again operating the clippers
i was the barber
the drone of the clippers has continued over the black
a voice fades up so two blocks later i look at the change she gave me and golly im two bits short
two bits short
so i walk back over to lintons find this gal big argument she doesnt even recall the transaction
doesnt recall the transaction no recollection so i said look dear
we are looking at a magazine story
its headline over an illustration of a cresting wave is wave of the future
underneath are black and white photographs of heavy equipment and racks of clothing on motorized tracks
subheadlines read next to godliness dry cleaning sweeps the nation the thoroughly modern way to clean
ed sits in one of the vinyl chairs staring at life magazine
the offscreen conversation drones on as the new man works on a customer
go ahead look at the menu if youre in before six oclock its the whatchamacallit the early bird special
yeah the early riser
ed flips the pages of the magazine and stops on a photograph of a dark desert landscape with one bright light hovering in the sky
the caption underneath roswell new mexico
ed looks up
a man in a black suit and fedora has directed the question at the new man who looks up from his gabbling momentarily slackjawed
my name is diedrickson
county medical examiner
just came for an informal chat
diedrickson looks around uncomfortably
why dont i buy you a drink
ed rises from his chair and as he unbuttons his smock addresses the new man who still gapes
dwight you ok here for a few minutes
whuh uh yeah sure ed take your time
it is late afternoon dusty and empty
ed and diedrickson sit on adjacent stools diedrickson cocking his hat lower to its man sitting at a bar position
as the bartender approaches rye
you sure you dont want something stiffer
ed shrugs and shakes his head
coffee it is
diedrickson interlaces his fingers on the bartop and stares at them
after a beat county m
does an autopsy on anyone who dies in custody
i dont know if you knew that
ed doesnt answer
diedrickson after some more staring at his hands plows on doesnt become a matter of public record unless theres foul play
i dont believe im prohibited from telling you this
i guess im not obliged to tell you either
i dont exactly know
but if i were the man id want to be told
the bartender has set down the drinks
diedrickson waits for him to leave
he takes a hit from his glass
finally im sorry to add to your burden crane but id want to know it it was me
your wife was pregnant
well there it is
he mutters to himself hell i hope ive done the right thing
my wife and i had not
performed the sex act in many years
aloud well thats not really my business
he is hastily digging for money
well there it is
he leaves a couple of bills on the bar and mumbles as he leaves good luck crane
his retreating footsteps echo down the bar
it is a dingy hallway lit by bare bulbs
ed stands in the middle background knocking on a door
doris and i had never really talked much
i dont think thats a bad thing necessarily
but it was funny now i wanted to talk now with everyone gone
i was alone with secrets i didnt want and no one to tell them to anyway
the door opens and ed is admitted by the unseen tenant
we hear a low murmuring as we slowly pan the apartment
it is overfurnished with heavy ornate chairs sideboards chests too big for the space and all going too seed
surface areas are covered with yellowing lacework or exotic brocades the one lamp has a veil thrown over it to further scrim down its feeble light
our pan brings us onto ed seated at a small card table across from a small elderly woman in a shawl who is the source of the murmuring
her eyes are squeezed shut in concentration as she mumbles
i visited a woman who was supposed to have powers in communicating with those who had passed across as she called it
she said that people who passed across were picky about who theyd communicate with not like most people you run into on this side
the woman opens her eyes and looks at ed
giff me your hant
ed places his hand in the center of the table
so you needed a guide who they didnt mind talking to someone with a gift for talking to souls
ed looks at the womans spotted and vein lined hand as it rests upon his
her mumbling resumes
well first she told me that my wife was in a peaceful place that our souls were still connected by some spiritual bond that she had never stopped loving me
even though shed done some things she wasnt proud of
ed looks up at the old woman
she was reading me like a book
she is stealing a glance at ed to check his reaction
and then she started talking about dolores this and dolores that and was there anything i wanted to tell dolores and i knew id just be telling it to the
and even if somehow doris could hear it wouldnt be on account of this so called medium
ed is leaving
she was a phony
just another gabber
ed emerges from the building
i was turning into ann nirdlinger big daves wife
i had to turn my back on the old lady on the veils on the ghosts on the dead before they all sucked me in
ed disappears into the night
it is night
we are looking through the screen door
walter abundas sits in yellow lamplight by a small table on the side of the staircase over which papers are strewn
he is murmuring into the telephone as he examines the papers glasses halfway down his nose a drink in one hand
eds hand enters to rap on the door
walter looks up sets the phone down and comes to the door
ed howre you holding up
im ok walter thanks
walter opens the door to him
im so damn sorry about your loss
just damn terrible
birdys in the parlor im on long distance here
birdy also has papers spread across a table in front of her homework
she looks up at eds entrance
hello mr crane
we havent seen you since
im terribly sorry
ed sits across from her
weve certainly missed you
birdy ive been doing a lot of thinking
there are a lot of things that havent worked out for me
life has dealt me some bum cards
he is loading a cigarette into his mouth
or maybe i just havent played em right i dont know
but youre pop doesnt like people smoking in here
this takes a moment to register
birdy lowers her voice sometimes i have a cigarette in here when hes away
never when hes in the house
he can smell it a mile off
ed is pocketing the cigarette
sure its his house
thats what he keeps telling me
ed smiles thinly
my point is youre young
a kid really your whole life ahead of you
but its not too soon to start thinking
to start making opportunities for yourself
before it all washes away
well sure i guess
pop says so too
i work pretty hard at school
however the music if you want to pursue it well the lessons from mrs swan theyll only take you so far
theres this guy in san francisco ive made inquiries everybody says hes the best
trained lots of people whove gone on to have big concert careers symphony orchestras the works
his name is jacques carcanogues
im not sure im pronouncing it right
anyway hes a frenchman
youve got talent anyone could see that
and hes the best
if he thinks a student has talent hell take em on for next to nothing
youre a cinch to be accepted i could cover the cost of the lessons like i said its pretty modest oh mr crane i have to do it
i cant stand by and watch more things go down the drain
youre young you dont understand
geez mr crane i dont know
i hadnt really thought about a career or stuff
i know you havent
look just go meet him as a favor to me
i talked to this guy
hope i pronounced his name right
he sounded very busy but hes not a bad egg he loosened up a little when i told him how talented you are
he agreed to see you this saturday
he said maybe you were a diamond in the rough
geez mr crane
just see him as a favor to me
it is a small square room with straightbacked chairs set against the walls
at the far end of the room a door leads to a studio from which piano music dully emanates it is a fast and difficult piece of music
ed sits waiting
he is the only adult two or three youngsters of different ages sit apparently waiting for their lessons
ed looks at one of the waiting boys in a white shirt and bow tie
he is perhaps eleven
his hair is greased back in a junior contour
another boy in a cardigan sweater sports a butch
the piano piece is ending
there is the murmur of voices
the studio door swings open
a small man in a rumpled black suit smudged with cigarette ash is bowing birdy out the door
he has a goatee and a knotted foulard
his eyes flit over the waiting room and settle on ed
you are ze fahzer
i am carcanogues
he smiles at birdy
you wait my dear
sure mr k
a jerk of carcanogues head bids ed rise
ed enters uncomfortable
he looks around taking in the high ceilinged space which is dominated by a grand piano
carcanogues has followed him and now runs water from a tap
i speak to you on ze phone non
you have a special interest in music
ah yes a music lover
well i dont pretend to be an expert
he uncaps a small bottle of pills shakes two into his palm tosses them back and washes them down
he twists a cigarette into a long holder sticks it in his mouth and lights it
howd she do
this elicits a gallic frown of consideration
she seems like a very nice girl
she plays monsieur like a very nice girl
very nice girl
i dont understand
is not so hard to understand
her playing very polite
did she make mistakes
another gallic moue mistake no it says e flat she plays e flat
hit the right note always
i dont understand no mistakes shes just a kid i thought you taught the uh the ah but that is just what i cannot teach
i cannot teach her to have a soul
look monsieur play the piano is not about the fingers
done with the fingers yes
but the music she is inside
a two handed gesture indicating his heart
the music start here
he waggles his fingers come out through here then maybe
his wave takes in the heavens she can go up there
well look i dont claim to be an expert then you listen to me for i am expert
that girl she give me a headache
she cannot play
very clever hands
someday i think maybe she make a very good typist
we are driving through the rural countryside of northern california
it is a two lane road with little traffic
sun strobes the car through the passing trees
ed drives glaring
birdy next to him seems unperturbed ever cheerful
i stank didnt i
he didnt say that
but more or less
look im no expert but it doesnt matter mr crane
im sure theres a dozen teachers better than this clown
but it doesnt matter
really im not interested in playing music professionally
ed looks at her
im not certain ill have a career at all and if i do ill probably be a veterinarian
i do appreciate the interest youve taken though
im only sorry that i didnt play better for you
i know it wouldve made you happy
you know what you are
youre an enthusiast
he loads a cigarette into his mouth
i guess ive been all wet
but i do appreciate it mr crane
she reaches over to touch his thigh
i wanted to make you happy
birdy its ok
she is leaning over his lap
i want to do it mr crane
ed is shocked birdy
he reaches awkwardly wanting to push her away but not wanting to be violent
please mr crane its ok please the blare of an oncoming horn
ed looks up one hand struggling with birdy the other on the wheel
the oncoming car
ed swerves tires screech into a skid birdy screams
crash the car hits a roadside tree
time slows down right before an accident and i had time to think about things
i thought about what an undertaker had told me once that your hair keeps growing for a while anyway after you die
a hubcap is skipping in slow motion along the road and then off the road down an embankment
and then it stops
i thought what keeps it growing
is it like a plant in soil
what goes out of the soil
and when does the hair realize that its gone
we are high looking down at ed who is motionless head resting on the steering wheel of the stopped car
we boom down toward his slowly rotating as we move in
as we move we lose focus ed becomes more and more blurry
the blurry shape is now slowly spinning away from us a bright revolving disc spinning up into the darkness until it disappears leaving only black
ed sits on the front porch of his bungalow smoking a cigarette in the late afternoon light
a dog barks next door a distant screen door slams children are playing somewhere up the street
ed looks down at his watch
something attracts his attention at the foot of his driveway stands a man in a cream colored suit and hat
he is a small figure perfectly still staring at the gravel driveway
after a beat he lifts up a small clipboard squints at the house and jots something down
he finishes writing screws the lid back onto his pen and is sticking it into a breast pocket when he realizes he is being watched
his manner instantly warms
the man starts up the walk
i notice you still have peastone in your driveway
well of course you dont have to rejuvenate that once every couple of years dont you when the peastone thins out
where does it go huh
like the odd sock
but you know where it goes you probably pick pieces of it off your lawn all the time churn it up with your lawn mower sweep it off the walk
here pain in the neck
ed shrugs again
doesnt bother me
well have you ever considered tar macadam
people think its just for public works and commercial purposes roads parking lots so forth
a car pulls into the drive
but we have the technology now to bring it to the homeowner the individual consumer at a very reasonable price
doris emerges from the car
mind if i show you the specifications
doris gives him a hard look
whatre you selling
the man gives a practiced laugh
well maam i was just telling your husband here about tar macadam for your home driveway here these are the specs
doris takes the brochure he has pulled from a small case
its the modern way to doris tears the brochure in half and hands it back
the man gazes at her
his smile fades fast and he and doris stare at each other two hard cases
he turns stiffly and stalks off
once his gaze has broken doris turns as well
she stalks up the stairs to the porch and bangs through the screen front door of the house letting it slam behind her
quiet early evening
ed sits smoking
at length he rises and goes in to the house
it is dim no lights on yet
we hear banging and clomping from the kitchen
doris emerges with a clinking sound chasing ice cubes around a drink with a swizzle stick
her face is still hard set
with a groan of its old upholstery springs she sits onto the couch
ed sits as well
he draws on his cigarette drags an ashtray closer on the coffee table
doris nah dont say anything
the light is failing
the clink of ice cubes
in the black we hear machine noise of indistinct origin
as the noise becomes more defined we also hear shouting faint distant are you there
are you awake
a blurry white disc is fading up
as it focuses it resolves into the reflector worn by a white robed doctor leaning in close
he leans away murmuring hes coming around
can you talk sir
these men have to talk
ed is lying in a hospital bed
his face is bandaged and one side is grotesquely swollen
the machine noise is life support
are you awake
two police officers persky and krebs lean in
are you awake
is he awake
we have to tell you as soon as youre conscious is he conscious
his eyes are open
youre under arrest
as soon as the doctor lets us we gotta move you
does he understand that
were supposed to tell him
are you conscious
youll go to the prison hospital
under arrest for murder
eds speech is thickened by injuries and anesthesia birdy
i didnt mean to whatd he say
no the girls ok
the doctor leans in
thats the collarbone crane
shes ok though
so he understands
hes under arrest for murder
whatd he say
does he understand
he said ok
is that what he said
krebs raises his voice youre under arrest for the murder of creighton tolliver
do you understand
the voices are fading away does he understand
light glimmers in water
we are drifting down down down
we bring in languidly waving arms the arms of a child waving to keep himself submerged
it is a ten year old boy staring wide eyed at something in front of him
bubbles intermittently stream from his open mouth
a kid diving at a waterhole outside of town had found his car
the reverse shows the car also submerged with creighton tolliver inside also wide eyed his hairpiece attached at only one corner the rest of it waving free
theyd winched it out
we are tracking laterally across a line of faces seated men
the men rise
and found hed been beaten just like big dave said beaten to death
we arc around a judge entering the chamber through the small door behind his raised bench
inside the briefcase were the partnership papers id signed
the judge seats himself and we resume out lateral track on the jury now reseating itself
showing that id given him ten grand
for the district attorney
in response to a prompt from the judge the district attorney rises to read the charge
his voice plays distantly muted the words not discernible under the continuing voice over
that made it fall into place id gotten doris to steal the money the pansy had gotten wise somehow and id had to kill him to cover my tracks
i was in a spot
i called in freddy riedenschneider
riedenschneider rises into frame at the defense table
as he listens to the charge and signed the house over to him
he said he didnt ordinarily work that cheap but he figured he owed me something since the last one hadnt played out
the drone of the d
has ended and riedenschneiders echoing voice drops into the hole not guilty your honor
i tried to tell him the whole story but riedenschneider stopped me
he said the story made his head hurt and anyway he didnt see any way of using it without putting me on the hot seat for the murder of big
riedenschneider claps ed reassuringly on the shoulder as he sits next to him
ed still wears a cast on one arm and one leg
he told me not to worry though said hed think of something freddy riedenschneider wouldnt let me down
we are tracking in on ed lying on the bunk in his cell
they put me on twenty four hour deathwatch
a reverse track shows a guard on a tilted back straightbacked chair outside the cell door staring at ed
so that i couldnt cheat justice like they said my wife had done
the district attorney is rising again this time to address the jury
but in front of the jury they had it that doris was a saint the whole plan had been mine i was a svengali whod forced doris to join my
the district attorney is pointing at ed
cynically used his own wife as a cats paw in a scheme of diabolical cunning
on and on it went how id used doris and then let her take the fall
that stuff smarted because some of it was close to being true
the district attorney seats himself
the jurys eyes turn to freddy riedenschneider who studies the tabletop in front of him either digesting the d
s opening statement or seeking inspiration for his own
and then it was freddy riedenschneiders turn
riedenschneider rises paces begins to talk
i gotta hand it to him he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes
he talked about how id lost my place in the universe
a puny player on the great worlds stage
how i was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the d
made me out to be how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel and he threw in some of the old truth stuff
he hadnt had a chance to trot out for doris
who among us is in a position to say
he told them to look at me look at me close
that the closer they looked the less sense it would all make that i wasnt the kind of guy to kill a guy that i was the barber for christs
we pan the jury solemnly listening to riedenschneider
i was just like them an ordinary man guilty of living in a world that had no place for me guilty of wanting to be a dry cleaner sure but
not of murder
riedenschneider is striding energetically into the foreground to point a finger directly at eds face
he said i was modern man and if they voted to convict me well theyd be practically cinching the noose around their own necks
he told them to look not at the facts but at the meaning of the facts and then he said the facts had no meaning
it was a pretty good speech and even had me going
a tap on the shoulder turns ed around
until frankie interrupted it
frank socks ed sending him clattering to the floor
a bailiff immediately restrains him but frank looms over ed bellowing through tears what kind of man are you
what kind of man are you
riedenschneider interposes his body between franks and eds loudly protesting move for a mistrial your honor
move for a mistrial
this outrageous display cannot help but prejudice
ed moves to get up but riedenschneider with a sidelong glance and furtive gesture motions for him to stay on the floor
and inflame the passions of these twelve fine men and women
well he got his mistrial but the well had run dry
there was nothing left to mortgage riedenschneider went home and the court appointed lloyd garroway
ed is now standing next to a distinguished older gentleman who enters the plea in the new trial your honor we plead guilty with extenuating circumstances
who threw me on the mercy of the court
it was my only chance he said
i guess that meant i never had a chance
the judge starts droning the sentence a menace to society
a predator on his own wife his business associates on an innocent young girl
the offender forfeits the right to his own life
i hereby order that you be taken to a place of confinement
we are tracking down the hall
he wasnt buying any of that modern man stuff or the uncertainty stuff or any of the mercy stuff either
no he was going by the book and the book said i got the chair
ed is in the cell at the end of the hall lying on his bunk hands clasped behind his head
so here i am
at first i didnt know how i got here
i knew step by step of course which is what ive told you step by step but i couldnt see any pattern
ed sits at the little table next to his bunk writing
now that im near the end im glad that this mens magazine paid me to tell my story
writing it has helped me sort it all out
theyre paying five cents a word so youll pardon me if sometimes ive told you more than you wanted to know
recent issues of the magazine gent and its sister publication nugget lie on the little desk
their lurid covers depict feature stories like i was abducted by aliens and but now all the disconnected things seems to hook up
ed sets aside the pen lies down on his bunk and closes his eyes
thats the funny thing about going away knowing the date youre gonna die and the mens magazine wanted me to tell how that felt
we hear a pulsing treble hum
ed opens his eyes
the door to his cell is open
he rises and goes through the door
ed alone walks down the hallway
the pulsing treble hum is louder
well its like pulling away from the maze
while youre in the maze you go through willy nilly turning where you think you have to turn banging into dead ends one thing after another
ed emerges into the empty prison yard ringed by high stone walls
a hard spotlight shines down from above
ed squints into it
but get some distance on it and all those twists and turns why theyre the shape of your life
its hard to explain
the spotlight is from a hovering flying saucer
we see its revolving underside and as it irregularly cants a bit of its top bubble
after spinning briefly it tips and flies away carrying the tremolo hum with it
but seeing it whole gives you some peace
ed turns and re enters the prison
ed is lying on his bunk eyes closed hands clasped behind his head
a hand enters to shake him awake
three men loom over him two guards and another man wearing a surplice and holding a bible
the mens magazine also asked about remorse
yeah i guess im sorry about the pain i caused other people
he is walking the last mile
but i dont regret anything
not a thing
i used to
i used to regret being the barber
a door at the end opens an electric chair
straps open and waiting i dont know where im being taken
ed is placed in the chair
i dont know what waits for me beyond the earth and sky
but im not afraid to go
a man stoops at his feet
he has a bucket of water and a straight razor
he waggles the razor in the water and starts shaving a patch of eds calf
maybe the things i dont understand will be clearer there like when a fog blows away
ed watches as the razor makes the trip from his leg to the bucket of water which begins to spot with small floating hairs
maybe doris will be there
they are strapping him in connecting the electrodes
and maybe there i can tell her
the men withdraw
all those things
a thin man in a dark suit and fedora stands by the switch
as he reaches for the switch ed looks up into the light
they dont have words for here
