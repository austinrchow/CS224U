tricycle mam locks his machine and walks toward coffee shop
green gets out of his car locks it starts in the same direction
norman parks the limo goes into main building
norman is attracted to large connie white display
at the entrance is another connie white display and from the jukebox we hear one of her songs
the waitress sueleen drops a fork then gets another from an overflowing sink and hands it to her customer tricycle man
there are several people at the counter with him including green who has just walked in
another man enters delbert reese
sueleen waits on all of them
a small black man comes out of the kitchen carrying a tray full or dishes
this is wade
to sueleen you want a ride into town
reese looks up checking out sueleen then wade then the tricycle man then his breast pocket to see it his wallet and checkbook are still there then he buries himself
in his newspaper

she nods and talks to the tricycle man
reese keeps sneaking looks at her
ive just been waiting for the right spot to sing in
im so nervous
she laughs and starts to rinse the dishes in the sink
im good though
there aint but one sueleen gay i dont mean to be conceited but really its true
ive been taking special coaching lessons from zeke willard hes just wonderful
teaches you how to phrase thats really important
well you know all about that
anyway i wrote this song
she looks down and then begins to half whisper sing and half do all of the gestures for a song she has written as she wipes some glasses
the jukebox continues to play connie white and every time someone walks by sueleen stops
she finally gets through the song and discovers reese has been watching too
she looks away from him to the tricycle man who smiles
be has finished his meal
oh listen i really do go on
heres your check
sure has been nice talking to you
as she removes her apron a haven hamilton song comes on the jukebox keep on a goin
the tricycle man leaves
we hear the last chorus or keep on a goin as sung by haven who is recording
he is always dressed in white
in the booth are bud and lady pearl
also present are two engineers and a producer
haven is accompanied by a long haired piano player with a white sweater
haven is not too happy with him
opal enters the booth carrying a too large english tape recorder
haven stops singing mad at opals interruption and the piano player
through the glass we see him pantomiming instructions for her to leave
as she does haven starts over
opal wanders to the next studio
bud follows apologizing
he sees a tape recorder and gets upset
she looks at him
hes my father
haven hamilton is your father
can you arrange an interview
they have entered a different control tooth
in the recording portion linnea and an all black male choir sings a gospel song
opal asks bud who this group is
haven has just exploded at the piano player and starts to leave yelling at the producer
who the hell is playing piano
get that hippie out of here
hes got a tin ear
i asked for pig dammit
im moving on cause i gotta get to the airport
when you get my backups straight then well talk about cutting this tune here
he heads for the hallway
it is jammed with black singers from the choir
haven hates being crushed and moves through the congestion like a white knight
opal moves near
excuse me sir
im here putting together a film
i would like to ask some questions
she has to fumble with the bulky tape machine and transformer
im from bbc television
where the hell is that
haven nod a politely and leaves the crowded hallway with bud and pearl
he spots linnea
how you doing haven
couldnt be better
they all say goodbye and havens group gets into a new white jeep barbara jeans plane taxis to a halt
reese leaves a tip and exits the coffee shop to greet the plane
page missing tom spots stews and goes to them you ladies got room for a spare
joan is left in the dust
nice talking to you
green sees his niece and walks over
did you see who that was
glad to see you
esterll be glad too
he is just wonderful
i l get your bag
glenn has just deposited a postcard in a mailbox and approaches a gathering cluster of people
norman and tricycle man are nearby
everybody is waiting for barbara jean to appear
glenn steps close to norman
am i late
he runs off
as norman runs toward passenger loading we see havens jeep arrive with haven bud and pearl
it parks and all climb out
reese and triplette approach the barbara jean plane
barnett is already on the runway making arrangements
havens group all shake hands
delbert how are you
this here is john triplette
triplette like you to meet the honorary mayor haven hamilton
good to meet you
turns to bud bud have them move the horses
pleasure where is she
still inside the plane posing for pictures and signing autographs
shes got a new album cut again
shell be down in a minute
but shell be late for the opera if she doesnt hurry
bud get the plane on the walkie talkie
bud fumbles on his walkie talkie telephone but cant seem to get anything
they dont seem to be answering
the ambulance boys are here though
barnett always expects them to get there like a shot
that thing only goes a hundred fall bore with the sirens going
thank you bud
bud nods like he has been complimented
a wave of noise begins from the fans
the band and majorettes and horses and ropers go into a rendition of one of her hit tunes as barbara jean appears
everyone is breaking their neck to see especially glenn
haven and reese give her the first round of applause then go back to talking
triplette has never been exposed to anything quite like this before and stands a little in awe of the situation
when the twirling and tricking and music stop barbara jean descends the stairs
bud tell them to move the horses
promised this strip would be spic and span
he smiles and winks
listen well go get the car and come back
thisl be going on for a while
shes probably talking to somebody about their sick child
you know how she is
they wave goodbye and head in the direction of the loading zone
behind them the horse people disperse and get into their cars and horse trailers preparing to return to nashville
barnett comes over to reese triplette haven bud and pearl while barbara jean continues to greet fans
while the barbara jean arrival takes place on the runway norman finds bill and mary
norman speaks softly and out of breath trying to pretend hes on time
bill slaps him on the back and engulfs him
norman looks relieved
bill and mary have been arguing
sure is nice to see you all again
i never thought id see you again after the last time
oh norman you worry too much
mary takes normans hand
norman how are you
she kisses him and he blushes
bill and mary are glad to talk to someone else
as they walk to the limo we see a car with loudspeakers on top of it and clearly written door signs that read replacement party in red white and blue
reese and tiliplette are walking toward it shaking hands with several people
sure have missed you all though
oh wheres tom
isnt he with you
dont worry about old tom
tom and the stews walk to a vw with a sun roof
nearby reese and triplette get into their cadillac behind it the replacement party car
coming from the loudspeakers a tape recorded voice have you thought about your future and what america needs to examine
behind the replacement party car is an airport bus with connie white posters on the side
glenn is one or the passengers
he cranes his neck to continue watching the runway and barbara jean
normans limo with bill and mary follows traffic as the tricycle man fires up his machine
wades car with sueleen also joins the procession
the orange ambulance has moved into the area near the plane and there seems to be a great deal at activity
reese and triplettes car stops and they rush out and run into haven who is shouting for people to get the hell out of the way
two ambulance attendants cut through the crowd
haven triplette and reese rush near
barnett is on his knees over barbara jean who has collapsed
the attendants lean over her with ammonia
they test her reflexes etc
how long was she out
not too long
but she keeps passing out
she comes to and looks at them all
oblivious just give your manna that vitamin e
makes a world of difference
here she is again
she resists the ammonia looks around and passes out again
okay lets get her to the wagon
a stretcher is brought in and she is placed under oxygen
barnett climbs into the ambulance with barbara jean slamming the door on delbert and triplette
haven stands there yelling at people
delbert and triplette rush back to their car as the ambulance speeds off siren wailing
leads the procession
eaters been asking for you
joan is trying to find a station she likes on her transistor radio
shes been in the hospital two weeks yesterday
joan cant find anything she likes
you know anything about the stations here
hasnt heard its hard to say
doctors thought shed come home a week ago
all it was was appendix
all they got is advertisements
just like l
did an exploratory and according to them she needed an overhaul
he chuckles at his prepared joke
well i could use one especially if im pregnant
what did you say
i said maybe ill change my name again
well those doctors are real miracle workers
but not unless nashville really inspires me
maybe you can look after me a little
that tom sure is cute
speeding by each vehicle
barbara jean and barnett are alone
being very piggish in its driving habits
we had these two city boys come in last week
one or them said his ford truck had cut off his foot
the other one said that wasnt true
then the first said he looked just like eddie black when he said that
bud would you be sure to get the oil changed
where do you want me to take it
do you remember eddie black
he had those blue eyes
where you always take it
theres nothing special about this time
and they started pounding on each other
but the one without the foot was strongest

anything you want me to say
say i had to get back to the session
god all school did for you you can put in a thimble
the cops came through and broke it up
i finally just had to call chet and say chet get over here
there are two old bays here breaking up the furniture
sueleen in doing some vocal exercising
wade listens for awhile
is that what youre going to sing
no thats exercises
my coach says you have to do exercise because the vocal chords are muscle and need to be stretched
every time you stretch them the middle part sets stronger
thats the place where i sing
you think i got any kind of a voice
he breaks into a scale
you sure do it loud
is that good
its not bad
you think i should take lessons
if youre serious
being serious is real important

glenn is at the window
connie white ads are present
part of normal traffic
it belongs to tommy brown who lounges with four very black associates playing serious poker
joining the procession from an auxiliary route
with her is opal who interviews linnea
have your children been deaf since birth
yes yes they have
it was a real shock at first especially since my daddys a preacher but delbert and i have been blessed by their being here

kenny is caught up in the crowd entering nashville
you got the money

albuquerque turns and looks out the window
they ride in resentful silence

grand old opera i hate that music

near a bridge a huge diesel truck almost collides with the replacement car which has just made a greedy move
to avoid collision the diesel jackknifes blocking all traffic behind it except for one narrow lane
mary sits erect
oh my god
bill climbs out
norman just sit there and dont puke
he runs toward the truck
at this point the tricycle man appears through all the cars
the tricycle man works his way through traffic
star has climbed from his truck and goes to help
albuquesque takes advantage and runs off
it overheats and explodes
kenny gets out carrying his violin case and starts to walk
albuquerque spots him and steps near
hey mind if i walk with ya
she looks at his violin case
you a musician
do you have people in nashville
no just coming to nashville thats all
barnett is in a rage
the attendants administer oxygen to i dont care
i pay you people twenty five bucks an hour and keep you working steady
now either go on or turn around
the ambulance passes all the vehicles including the horse rigs
as he passes normans limo dont worry norman
theres no blood
she climbs out of the car and moves to the freeway rail and yells for some workmen below to call the police
the driver is hurt badly
tricycle man and star are there
star looks up relieved an ambulance is coming
his face drops as the ambulance speeds past and toward the city
albuquerque is walking with kenny
she sees star returning to his truck
she ducks into the ivy
hurt my foot
star approaches his truck sees albuquerque is gone and spots have you seen a woman about so high
she had on high heels
need a ride
kenny nods yes and climbs in the pickup
people are helping the injured driver
tricycle man climbs on his machine and leaves heading toward nashville
barbara jean is in bed
a doctor is there along with a crowd of publicity people and well wishers including triplette reese bud
barnett hovers over barbara jean
the atmosphere is stifling
barbara id like to talk to you and barnett alone
anything you say
he turns to the visitors
doctor says youll have to go on out now there are tones of disappointment most of them are very involved in their own conversations
triplette walks toward the bed but cant really get close enough
he finally captures barnett as the people start to leave
excuse me barnett hows she doing
barnett turns and studies him for a moment as though he remembers who he is
i feel as if i know you
im john triplette
a friend of del reese
i was at the airport
i just wanted to introduce myself
im a great fan of hers
if theres anything you need just give me a call
im at the sheraton south
shes going to rest now
okay i just wanted to see if i could help out at all
the crowd is almost out of the room now
we see glenn there as he steps into the hallway
i appreciate your concern but she has to rest so you can go on home
he stands there too long
what do you really want
not a thing barnett really
i need a little information
but ah it can wait
barnett says you bet again and closes the door after triplette
barnett returns to the bed with barbara jean and the doctor
well its exhaustion pure and simple and youre going to have to take a rest or youre going to be in big trouble
she has to be at the opera tomorrow night and then she can go home
shes not going anywhere barnett
this is precisely what im talking about
she is collapsing
she cannot go on without a rest or she will have to stop altogether for a long time
well i have to go its too late to be replaced and besides i just cant do that
those people get disappointed
theyve come in from all over you know and this miss foxy whos been writing to me for years is going to be there from michigan
you cannot leave this bed until i say so
the two of you have to understand that
barnett youve got to stop this dovetailing and give her some rest
you dont need to make that much more money
its not the money
the friends and neighbors love her and they want to see her
we got a debt to the public
well they are not going to see her tomorrow night and i suggest you get on the phone and make the necessary arrangements
a few of the people still remain among them glenn who has just finished another postcard
near barbara jeans hospital room in mrs
green is visiting her now and la
joan waits in the hall smoking a cigarette
bud is talking with a few people
joan brings out a new cigarette and asks glenn for a ight
he doesnt have one so she moves to bud
she scares him but he lights her fresh cigarette anyway
she asks him for a ride and they leave together as green comes out
green begins to look for tricycle man parks in front
sueleen is auditioning
the tricycle man goes to the bar and listens
he is one of the few people who do
sueleen directs her performance to him
also at the bar is tom being interviewed by opal
we just got a gold record
do they have a show to give it to you
no hell some secretary in new york just hands it to you
only this one kept dropping it out of the box
did it break
dent it a little
boy just she couldn t even find it
she had a hamburger on her desk that looked three weeks old
how long have you been together
probably a little too long

depends on what im studying
star is down at the end drinking alone and looking for albuquerque
the phone rings and the manager answers it
establish the reeses relationship with their children
delbert speaks to triplette when do you need her
you want her to sing too
sueleen has finished her song and eavesdrops blatantly
i can do benefits into phone how much
twenty dollars for her and ten for you
the manager keeps looking at sueleen well do you want a blonde
how does she look
okay ill get you your money
both hang up the telephones
the manager carefully looks at sueleem
i can only give you fifty a week here and ten bucks for the benefit
moneys no object
she kisses his cheek
he hates it
he writes on a piece of paper
you go here monday night and be there at eight sharp and look flashy you know what i mean
she nods yes and takes the paper

hundreds of times
well theres a couple of girls in printers alley if you got any questions

she isnt convincing

star sees her and chases her outside
star hits the pavement but there is no sign or albuquerque
he stands there as bud and l
bud and l
joan go to the bar as sueleen sings another song
tom has moved away from opal to the telephone
delbert triplette linnea and the kids are eating

he hangs up the phone
linnea looks at the dinner table and delbert and the kids
tom moves back to the bar and opal
joan has found the tricycle man more interesting than bud and slides close to him
bud takes the opportunity to sneak out
norman is on stage doing his routine a series of imitations and jokes with help from bluegrass pickers who introduce him to the audience
bill and mary are in the audience watching norman
at another table sit barnett tommy brown pearl haven negotiating a deal and watching norman as a potential warm up act
they think he stinks kenny enters with his violin case and sits
near the back wade is drunk leaning against the wall
albuquerque enters from the back door
she hangs around the kitchen stealing food
wade notices her and starts to talk to her
hey what are you doing
albuquerque pretends shes fixing her purse
just fixing this strap here i know what youre doing
ive done it too long not to know
but if youre going to hunt down food get enough so you wont have to do it again right away
peanut butters good
man can last a long time on peanut butter
alburquerque cant find any so she grabs whatever she can that will fit into her purse
norman caters his material to tommy brown hoping to get the job
quite drunk and yelling tommy brown you are the whitest nigger i have ever seen
tommy turns in his chair and looks at wade
barnett leans into lets go i dont think normans done yet
weve heard enough
hell youre whiter than that old boy up there
tommy and barnett leave
where the hell are you going oreo cookie
the bluegrass players pick up the tempo by playing music
kenny tries to calm wade down but wade belts him
norman sings the national anthem
pearl gets mad and tosses wade out the back door
albuquerque goes after wade to soothe him
bill mary and norman leave together out the front
albuquerque watches from the alley

green comes out of the hospital and walks over
he is hurt you should have stayed
esters been wanting to see you
they walk off to greens car
tricycle man drives oft
glenn is in the middle of the rose garden gathering a bouquet of flowers
when he finishes he enters the building
glenn walks past the desk holding the bouquet so no one will see it
he enters the elevator
in the most despicable kind of condition
albuquerque wades through the waste uses the john then discovers it wont flush
she goes to wash her hands but there is only a trickle
she takes some kleenex from her purse and dries her face and hands exiting the bathroom with the key still in the door
glenn eases out of the chair where he has been sitting all night
he has been writing a letter and puts it near the glass of flowers
he looks at barbara jean for the last time puts the chair back and leaves bumping into an entering nurse
who are you
glenn is too scared to say anything and takes off down the hall
the nurse checks barbara jean and lets it go at that
tom is in bed with opal
he gets up and goes to the window
we see the tricycle mans machine parked outside
come on back to bed

the phone is hung up in toms ear
tom studies the phone number for an instant then tosses it in the ashtray
opal has left and perhaps we even hear the roar of the tricycle
kenny stands on the front porch or one of the many rooming houses near music row
green opens the front door

she gets out of bed and goes to the bathroom
barbara jean suddenly starts to cry loudly
she covers the sound by flushing the toilet
when that cycle fades she flushes again
norman drives up and enters
norman picks up the house phone then sees mary

triplette clears his throat and turns his back to haven and continues to talk to opal
haven walks off

haven grabs the mike and bursts into one of his more famous songs then overlaps it with another
at the finish he accepts applause and begins to speak about barbara jean
we want to send special wishes to barbara jean who is in the baptist hospital
she collapsed yesterday morning at the plane christening
send your prayers and letters to baptist hospital nashville tennessee
barnett said she wept because she couldnt be here with you friends and neighbors
but your faith in the great almighty will bring her back here just to be what you want her to be
and her good friend connie white has given up some time with her own mother who is sick with a kidney disorder to fill in and send her warmth to
you wonderful friends and neighbors so you wont be too disappointed after this message from teeth sticken good gooey clusters
glenn politely leaves when connie white is announced
the tricycle man takes his seat next to l
albuquerque talks to two policemen

my people said it would be all right
no pass no entrance

connie white passes albuquerque and the policemen on her way to the bathroom
albuquerque rushes up

im here cutting a record you know and these policemen here
the policemen standing right behind her
they all know she is lying

a man walks into the group
miss connie youre next
connie smiles and squeezes albuquerques hand
oh honey i gotta go
thanks for coming
you read what i wrote you now
you said your friend connie
connie has disappeared and the police start to usher out albuquerque
she tries to see and hear as connie white starts to sing
she does a few of her tunes
tricycle man is the first to leave
hes with l
after they drive away there is an exodus
after everyone else has gone kenny sits alone in the audience
sueleen is in her mirror applying a whole face based upon the stars of the forties
she is listening to the opera on the radio and eating pork and beans and tuna from cans
her room is tilled with photographs of herself and catholic symbols
she goes to the closet and selects a gown
she is preparing an outfit and face for the benefit
we hear the tail end of connie whites song on the radio
barnett is intently listening
would you turn that off he continues to listen until the end
barnett please whats wrong honey
i dont want to listen to her sing dont feel that way honey
then why are you listening to her well i have to go thank her for filling in and its nice to know the tune she sang
you have to what
go to the king of the road and thank her
barbara jean gets up out of bed
well here why dont you take her some of these flowers while youre at it
she begins pulling flowers from various vases
maybe youd like to work out something with her too
split us up
her on the road and me in town or in the hospital she wails barnett
she sits down on the floor at the foot of the bed and begins to cry
barnett backs off
if she was hoping for understanding she is not about to receive it
what the hell is wrong with you
he bends down and looks at her with the eyes of a race horse owner whose investment just collapsed in the stretch
wait a minute
youre not going nutsey on me are you
youre not going to have one of those nervous breakdowns or anything are you
afraid she has gone too far barbara jean stops crying and tries to make everything all right
but she is still choking in her own panic of being left
no im just
im really fine
she gets up dont want you to think im giving up or anything like that
barnett looks at her as if from now on he will suspect her of secretly being crazy
he begins to pick up the flowers from the floor
ill just take these on over to her
show her your appreciation
barbara jean crawls numbly back into her bed nodding affirmatively
you go on and do that
she begins to shiver
barnett looks at her but he makes no attempt to come any closer
very small barnett
he leans in and pats her arm gingerly
ill tell her thank you for you
barbara jean nods affirmatively still shivering
please hold me voice barnett
she senses he cant go any further
he looks at her again and leaves
he is not out the door before the tears begin again and she turns into her pillow so he wont hear her
green has come from his wifes room
he sees barnett walk down the hall
after a moments deliberation green enters barbara jeans room
we see green come in the door
barbara jean is sti l trying to control herself but is not having much luck with it
to the pillow i just get so afraid sometimes
then i get more afraid
just want you to hold me
green cant bear what shes saying
he hesitates for a minute and then figures what the hell
she freezes thinking barnett has come back and she will be discounted as totally insane
am i disturbing you
im really all right barnett
dont you worry really
i just dont want you to leave me thats all
she turns and screams at green
oh my god
she scares green too but he recovers better
oh honey i didnt mean to scare you
how did you come in here
well my wife esters down the hall
i saw barnett leaving and i was just talking to ester about your being here
she loves you so much i just had to come down and say hello
weve been following you since you were a girl
well i just scared you to death
i didnt mean to do that
she listens to him
the words somehow comfort her and she begins to laugh
well i guess you caught me at a weak moment
youll have to speak up
realizing he cant hear too well makes her feel a little more secure
louder i said ive been real tired
eater says she doesnt see how you do it
loudly whats wrong with her
oh just about everything i guess
those doctors started on an overhaul and dont want to quit
they keep taking things out
shes going to come home an egg shell

a nurse enters

norman and bill are there
an entertainer is singing the connie white song that connie is doing at the opera
bill is eager to know where mary is
maybe shes at the opera
why the hell would she be there

barnett with the flowers enters and sits in the lounge
it is getting crowded by people returning from the opera
opal is on one of the house phones talking to paris
we can also hear the house phone operator behind the switchboard desk
opal speaks in a combination of english and french
she isnt saying much in one language and she might just be talking to the operator but is sounds impressive
connie white and her group step into the lobby
the mc in the lounge spots her and coaxes her into taking the stage and singing one of her hits
when she finishes barnett walks up and thanks her handing her the flowers
meanwhile haven who is there with bud and pearl tells triplette that connie and barbara jean will replace each other but never appear on the same bill
after barnett exits connie leaves with haven bud pearl and triplette
opal is still on the phone now speaking in ita ian
as connie and group step out of the lounge mary enters

bill starts to laugh
triplette starts to laugh
bill stops sure
he hangs up the phone and goes to the mirror yelling at mary
momentarily there is a knock on the door
bill walks to the door and opens it on triplettes sincere smile and extended hand

triplette enters the room and starts to take it in
mary comes from the bathroom her face swollen
bill and mary act as if nothing has happened

triplette laughs nervously

triplette laughs again

whats he running for

bill hes a crazy man
triplette moves in fast
well he expressed a particular wish to have you on
they stop and look at him suspiciously

triplette settles in like they were old friends

joan comes from her room and interrupts
she asks him where hes going

triplette cranes to look as a car with just married and weve only just begun painted on it drives by them
norman looks at it too
some black folks wanted to paint this car once

he makes another turn on to a street that looks like a series of parks strung together
he slows down
in the city of nashville there are a total of hundred and twenty millionaires some of them inhabit these beautiful home sites to make nashville known as the athens of
here on the right you see the home of haven hamiltons mother
he built it for her after his daddy passed away three years ago of lung cancer

bill is very anxious

bill sticks his head out from the studio room

mary walks pant tom into the studio room
tom holds up a finger to indicate hell be a minute and walks toward the bathroom
mary reaches bill

joan goes and waits outside the bathroom
when tom comes out they exit together
mary is at her mike with her instrument
the engineer asks for a level so bill and mary sing their hit song
when they finish where is he
barbara jean is sitting at the foot of the bed
a nurse in there talking to barnett

where have you got her hidden today
he hands the nurse a flower
she looks up in disbelief
how are you today

she makes several phone calls and cant locate anyone
she sighs and hangs up
you want me to wait
green i dont know how to tell you this your wire passed away i thought theyd called you at home
green has and hasnt heard
louder your wire ester she passed away
he is stunned
if youll wait just a minute ill get everything from the business office
he wanders to the waiting area
glenn has been looking out the window at barbara jean getting into the bus
he comes back and begins to talk to green so caught up in her he doesnt register greens grief
loudly my mamma used to know her
they lived next door to each other
she said she was always nursing the sick animals
green looks at him and nods
hes still got the vitamins in his hand
i really learned all about her from my momma shes been saving this scrap book about her since she got to be famous
the one thing she said to me when i joined was when youre doing your travels you be sure you see barbara jean
you dont have to say anything about me but you be sure you see her
so thats what ive been doing
now im going to hitch a ride so i can see her in memphis
you give my test to your wife green nods and puts the vitamins in his pocket as the nurse calls from the desk
green the doctor is on his way and the business office has your bill ready
the phone rings several times before linnea answers it
who is this right
i called you last night
ive got a gig tonight
end of church street
next to a grocery store

in out out in something like that
again she is left with a dead receiver
behind him is percy warner park and the parthenon
joan is with tom
sueleen works her way through a crowd of men trying to get into the banquet hall
there is a sign that says benefit banquet
sueleen finally makes it through the crowd and enters the room
she walks past the tables and steps on the stage
she checks the curtain to find that there is no backstage
she enters the kitchen
sueleen almost trips over reese and triplette and another man who are talking
hi im sueleen gay
im john triplette
i got all caught up in looking at you
youll be fine
oh why thank you
may i see your costume
she removes her coat and exposes a costume that looks like a picture of a frosty glass or gin and tonic on a hot day
tiriplette stares blatantly and reese can hardly keep his hands off her
sueleen starts into her routine as a matter of survival
you like it
listen where is the pianist
i need to go over this with him
she hands over a stack of music
you all didnt say what you wanted to hear
someday im gonna be a star like barbara jean
triplette puts his arm around her and walks off
sueleen youre prettier and probably sing better
besides she is unusually sick
and tonight you have the opportunity to work in front of some grateful gentlemen
they continue to walk past the many places
have you ever done this before
she shakes her head no quite caught up in air
well its not too hard
youll sing whatever it is you want to sing
theyll applaud like crazy cause i can tell them that youre really something and then the piano and drum will give you a little fanfare and you can sing and
take off your clothes or not sing
it really doesnt make much difference really
but since youve never done this before singing might help
they are near three enormous beef legs waiting to go into the oven
now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself
the more you take off you see more money we can raise
like a robot i see
i know that you are an artist and i am sure you are very religious
she nods yes
well this is for people who have a kind of religious belief in the way they live
the waiters come in to serve the salad and the rolls and the chef starts to carve the meat
we follow one of the waiters into the banquet hall
it is almost full
the pianist and the drummer are on the non stage
at the far end of the roam we see someone enter from the street go to the sign and read it
it is albuquerque reading banquet
the door to the room closes and she goes down another corridor and disappears
the men have finished their dinner and sueleen finishes her song
the applause is thunderous
sueleen looks to the kitchen door
triplette is applauding like crazy
reese in beside him
she blows kisses then runs to triplette
dont you think theyd just love another song instead
now sueleen you know thats not what we talked about right here in this very room
its too late
the announcer speaks
were ready to striiippppp
for cash gentlemen
the time has come to dig deep
our little sueleen in going to dig deep for you
there are a few chortles
suddenly she freezes
triplette holds her and kisses her hair
page missing triplette encases her in her coat
triplette yells something about bringing her clothes as the audience goes crazy
albuquerque is totally fascinated and delighted applauding to the point of almost giving herself away
she picks up sueleens clothes
reese drives susleen home
he is drunk
he double parks
here we are sueleen
she looks out the window and nods
he gets out and opens the door as lady pearl walks past them on her way to the lounge
star drives up behind reeses double parked ear and has to move around it
sueleen starts for her room but reese follows very close
finally he turns her around
his look says what he wants
she is terrified
she starts to walk quickly but he grabs her arm
wait a minute
i want to look at you
oh please oh god
he pushes her against one or the storefronts
i just wanna look
he squeezes her arm and she screams
i wanna look really good
you know what i mean
she is about to pass out from terror when all or a sudden he eases of
the tricycle man stands and watches a few feet away
sueleens terror now is divided between the two men
reese cant handle the way the tricycle man looks at all
he releases sueleen turns and runs up the street
she slides down and hugs herself
the tricycle man doesnt move
itll be okay
itll be okay
i know itll be fine
after a while she pulls herself up and starts up the stairs to her room
the tricycle man watches until she is gone then walks across the street
tom enters with l
the place in crowded
wade sits at a table with linnea
she hasnt seen tom

tom seems to know where linnea is sitting and directs the song to her
after he finishes he gives the guitar back to its owner and joins l
joan to walk out
wade starts in again

linnea is wiping her eyes with a hanky
a large group of people starts out the door among them tom and l
tom steers himself and joan to linneas table
bill and mary catch him there
all the while he is talking to them he writes a note and places it in linneas lap
opal walks past tom
they look at each other

im a scholar of the bible as well and were all going to answer to god

she nods yes

she is too curious
she takes out her glasses and looks through them lorgnette style as wade continues to talk

he saw us at tammany hall
the hell he did
look ill see you in the morning

as linnea hurries off we see star sitting in his pickup truck watching and waiting for albuquerque
the tricycle man is helping kenny fix the car changing tires etc
kenny is under the hood
when he comes out kenny tells the tricycle man how grateful he is and that he wouldnt know what to do if he hadnt shown up
the tricycle man just finishes the job
a platform has been erected in the center of the parking lot
barbara jeans bus is parked nearby
there is a large crowd and several people gathered around the platform
glenn is among them so is triplette reese and opal
radio station personnel and musicians prepare for the show
finally the bus door opens and barnett leads barbara jean to the platform
the musicians start and she sings
the sound comes from many huge speakers and people come from stores and shops to hear
barbara jean segues from one song to another
barnett stands to the side talking to various people triplette pulls his sleeve
well for heavens sake

i came out to see how you all were doing
i think i should tell you i know why youre here
the answer is no we dont get involved in politics

well its probably because it would help him
how is that
everybody likes to be as good as their word
are you telling me haven promised you something
thats pretty close
hes going to be on the bill
why not put barbara jean on with him
triplettes last sentence is caught in silence as barbara jean has stopped singing in the middle of a phrase
she holds the mike and looks at barnett
there in a moment of confusion then glenn is on the stage protectively as the musicians clear the people out barnett vaults through the crowd pushing triplette aside
get her feet up
he pulls himself on the stage
she is coming to and sees glenns face looking at her and rubbing her hands
he carries her to the bus
triplette is forced to watch from a distance
barbara jean has come to and she and barnett are alone in the back of the bus
he studies her carefully for a minute and then decides shell be all right
oh barnett im so sorry
honey its okay
how do you feel now
all those people
she fights back the tears
dont worry ill take care or it youre so good
he blows her a kiss and steps from the bus
barnett sends the nurses inside
glenn has pushed to front of the crowd
barhett grabs a hand mike
shes fine now folks
just too soon after the hospital i guess
he pauses she wont be able to continue and shes in the bus crying her eyes out because she doesnt want to disappoint the people who love her the most
there is a group groan
barnett looks for some under standing but there is none
there are several catcalls and glenn who in near barnett becomes so enraged he tries to find the caller
there is almost a fight but triplette intervenes
he glances to come on come on
you dont want to waste your energy on that fool
catcalls continue from other parts of the audience
triplette shouts against glenn who has turned his intensity to the crowd shes frail
you never saw anybody so frail
ive seen her breathe hard just standing still dammit
worst selfish ive ever heard
what if she died
would you like that
youd probably say she faked it so they could make money
well youre just dumb
we could invite them to the park
they can come to the concert in the park
i said no
barnett studies the angry crowd then triplette who is holding back glenn against them
the crowd is even more angry to crowd were very sorry
if youll listen
he makes the decision you can see her tomorrow at percy warner park
glenn has disengaged from triplettes hold and pushed his way to the back
triplette i want to talk to you
i got trapped and you know it so lets have some rules
listen barnett i understand your position
no you dont so dont say you do
bunch of damn liars
what do you get out or this
its my job
your job huh
he removes a pen and paper and writes down the following as he speaks
she will not appear on the stage or support that walker guy and you cant have any of his signs up while she sings
shell be on first and out of the park before he shows up
there will be no pictures no questions no answers or tying her name up with his now or in the future to come
any money she makes will go to the president of the united states
he calls over his secretary and makes triplette sign the statement
then the secretary signs
well see you tomorrow
ill send her three songs over this afternoon
shell be done about ten minutes after she starts and walker better not show up till shes through
now get out of here
triplette extends his hand expecting friendship
barrett ignores it
as triplette leaves a man who has been after barnetts attention steps up
barnett turns to his secretary
well barnett i have this terrific song ive been working on
it would be a natural for barbara jean
like you to take a look at it
barnett looks at him suspiciously
im very busy right now
to secretary get me haven
itll just take a minute
here ill even hold it for you
babnett sighs and skims over the paper
song stealing is the same as horse stealing to barnett
he becomes enraged
i dont know where you got this but something tells me you stole it and i hate thieves
the man takes the paper back and tries to walk away from him barnett yells after him
arent you an engineer
i know you dont you work at one of those cut a record places
twenty five bucks a shot isnt it
usually their last twenty five
the man backs up and barnett follows him
they have entered the crowd
the mab starts to run
barnett runs after him
when the man gets into the car
barnett picks up a rock throws it and hits the windshield with it
the car misfires but finally starts
as the man drives off barnett stands watching until hes out of sight
the following is intercut with the shopping center we see a fairground then a roller rink and a wrestling ring and finally a small portable stage in the center of
a circular track
the grandstands are partially ruled and stock cars roar from another part or the field around the stage we see a sign that says talent show tonight and we see
the contestants and the mc and norman doing a routine with an accordion player
after norman finishes the nc takes the mike
thank you mr
and now we bring you albuquerque
albuquerque walks to the mike
my name is albuquerque
there are a few nasty remarks
im going to sing a wonderful tune
she starts to sing youre an old smoothie and as she does the stock cars leave the pit and drive to the entrance of the track
alebuquerque disturbed at first sings louder
the cars are waiting for the talent show to set off the track
albuquerque starts to take off her clothes
the mc hasnt noticed but the grandstand has
people shout take it off
albuquerque loves it
before albuquerque can remove the last two garments the mc rushes over and grabs the mike
wed ike to announce the winner of tonights contest
albuquerque how about some applause for a darling little lady oh im not through
thats all folks
the stands are calling to have her take it all off and her fellow contestants are furious
raven bud and pearl are there and they discuss her act
here is the twenty dollars first prize money and a seat in the grandstands and now lets turn the show over to al allen in the race stand
he shuts oft the mike
the stock cars start around the track and stop in front or the race announcer
congratulations to albuquerque and welcome everyone to the memorial race for billy apple who died a week ago in a wreck at this very track and we want you to
know his last words were are the other fellows all right
a wave of applause and we see the talent show make its way across the rack
the platform is already torn down and the mc is helping albuquerque dress
as she passes the drivers they cheer and she blows them a kiss and loses her first garment as she does
the cars are dented
on the side of one car it says haven hamilton and now we see him bud and pearl in the stands
on the side of another car it says connie white
want you all to save a dime every day and next saturday well take up a collection and give it all to billy apples wife
their four kids will sure miss their daddy
want to announce bob trilltree is out of the hospital now
hope youll be back with us soon
all right would you stand please
the people stand to a scratchy record of the national anthem
a pontiac circles the track with a man holding a medium sized american flag which flaps as the convertible drive
at the end of the song the pontiac drives off the track
this is for billy apple
okay ladies and gentlemen lets pick ourselves a winner
the drivers get into their cars and start up
the track man waves a flag which starts them around the track in pairs
we notice the tricycle man who has been there all the time
the race starts and the sound is deafening
albuquerque is thrilled to death
suddenly star sneaks up on her as she whistles with her fingers in her mouth
winifred the kids want you home and so do i
i won first prize
she has no choice but to follow him out
several people compliment her as she leaves the grandstand
she buys a bag of peanuts on the way out
there is some lovemaking going on in toms bed
youre really terrific you know what i mean linnea rolls over and faces him
i have to go
i have to go
she makes a more to leave
she laughs and eases out of the bed
when did you think it would happen

i knew when i first met you
she starts to go into the bathroom
how old are you
im twenty eight oh
older than thirty
who was that black guy
a friend of yours
come on you ever been attracted to a black guy
she looks at him close then goes into the bathroom and shuts the door
we hear tom making a phone call
linnea grabs a towel and wraps it around her head and throws back the shower curtain only to find a huge black cockroach in the tub
tom laughs as she shuts the curtain in horror then she proceeds to take a sponge bath
she leaves the bathroom quickly
tom is still on the phone
linnea dresses but cant find her slip
she finishes and heads for the door
into phone just a minute
he steps to linnea and puts his arms around her
ill talk to you tomorrow
thats what you said before
he kisses her and walks back to the bed
as she gets to the door she is hit with something it is her slip
maybe you better keep that
he smiles and she walks out the door
outside linnea hangs the slip on the doorknob and leaves
green is in bed
kenny takes away a tray of cookies and hot chocolate
youre a fine boy ken you really are
you get to sleep
ill see you in the morning
good night kenny turns out the light and calls the dog
green settles into his pillow
a small empty last rite for mrs
kenny and green are at the grave
in the distance the tricycle man watches
i guess shes not coming
preparation for the big televised rally
outside the parthenon kenny with his violin case waits for some food at the barbecue
albuquerques who has fled star again waits near him
barnett is talking to reese
triplette is at the stairs
glenn is trying to get past a guard and finally triplette recognizing him from the shopping center helps him in
they enter the stair area near all the tv cables and equipment
they approach barbara jean who is talking to musicians
bill and mary are there with norman and linnea is singing on stage with the black choir
tommy now steps up to talk to barbara jean
glenn is lost in barbara jeans magic
she smiles at him but in talking to haven bud and pearl and looking for barnett
triplette walks by glenn
listen could you give her this for me
triplette takes a note from glenn
triplette hands her the note as barrett angrily steps up
someone calls places
they screwed up
you go on after the choir
tommy brown joins linnea and the choir on stage
we see tom wandering and avoiding bill but catching marys eye
opal is near as is la joan
barbara jean reads glenns note if i die tomorrow i lived today
the applause builds
ladies and gentlemen miss barbara jean
the audience is swept away
in the audience we see kenny and the tricycle man and wade
sueleen is there too
as barbara jean sings glenn stands next to barnett
she finishes the song and looks in glenns direction
she is leaning on a stool
i want to thank you for all your good wishes
you are so important to barnett and me
now i want to sing a special song for all our soldier boys
the orchestra starts
she calls for haven to come out
the applause swells and they start a song together
a long black limo is parked near two ambulances the attendants sitting on the ambulance fenders and joking
barbara jean and haven have finished the soldier song
the choir comes out to back her now
the audience picks up the song they sing
after the song everyone claps loudly and a large bouquet of flowers gets handed up to barbara jean
they hug as someone begins to unfurl a hal philip walker banner behind them
photographers crowd in
suddenly there is a sharp jolt in havens body and barbara jean is down
there is brief confusion but the choir continues to sing and everyone thinks barbara jean has fainted again
the confusion mounts as both haven and barbara jean are down and there are flowers lying all over the place barnett
my god barnett im shot
triplette runs up the stairs and the choir continues
barnett yells for them to stop
he and barnett are over barrara jean while guards and bud attend to haven
oh my god
theres blood here
taking mike ladies and gentlemen i dont know what to say
there is a voice among the noise that shouts i could have got that walker bastard before
ive been closer closer than this but my nash broke down and somebody kept stealing my things
i wanted to get him the day before then mr
greens wire died so this was the right time
i love the president of the united states
i love him
guards grab the speaker kenny in an instant
he shoots a policemans foot by accident
men swallow him up
someone yells sing
the choir has no direction to go in
alruquerque suddenly is with microphone
she starts to do it dont worry me
the rest of the singers join in
barnett leads the stretcher to one or the ambulances
he doesnt allow haven to enter
have your friend triplette take you to the hospital
a man walks up from the limo
it is walker
triplette is near
whatd she do faint again
im getting tired of waiting in the car
triplette turns and belts him
as it speeds to the hospital
barnett is calm
he knows none of it matters anyway
the tricycle man follows the ambulance then heads off onto the highway to memphis
we see stars truck going toward the parthenon
we see stars truck arrive and park
he gets out as the music and chaos swell
