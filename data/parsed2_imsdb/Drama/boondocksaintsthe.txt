written by shooting script white august as we open we see the inside of an enormous church
a young looking priest in his mid thirties is finishing the delivery of the lords prayer
in the back of the church in the last pew there are two who kneel on the cold stone floor
they do not stand to sing nor do they offer signs of peace when told but they pray
they grip and rub their rosaries
they mutter their words in latin
connor and murphy macmanus mid twenties are shrouded in thick waist length navy p coats worn leather boots and the hungry clothes of the poor
the boys heads are shaved and they have facial hair
dismissing young priest thank you father macklepenny for coming all the way across town to be our guest speaker today
i hope you found our little parish to your liking
macklepenny takes his seat on the alter along side the regular priests of the church
the macmanus brothers suddenly stand as all others remain seated
each church goer between them and the aisle shifts his her position to allow the boys passage as if on command
the two turn and begin to stride for the alter eyes down determined
thick irish accent theyve never been like anyone else
from the moment they were born of the same womb on the same day they just had their own way my boys did
and i always knew that one day they would do something of true greatness
i just never expected they would bring about such a
such a reckoning
the macmanus brothers are fraternal twins
as annabelle macmanus speaks macklepenny is taken aback as he scans the congregation amazed to find that he is the only one who thinks this out of the ordinary
the monsignor begins his sermon
macklepenny rises to stop the boys from this disgraceful disturbance
the elder clergyman finds macklepennys arm keeping him seated while shaking his head
macklepennys confusion gives way to awe as he watches the brothers step onto the altar brush by the six seated priests and approach the enormous crucifix
they both fall to their knees and kiss the feet of christ
they rise and as abruptly as they came they turn and head back down the aisle for the front door
they stop at the rear of the church turning to listen to the sermon
loud authoritative and i am reminded of this holy day of the sad story of kitty geneviese
this poor soul cried out time and time again for help but no person answered her calls
though many saw not one so much as called
her assailant wiped the bloody knife off on her lifeless little body
they watched as he simply walked away
nobody wanted to get involved
nobody wanted to take a stand
we must fear evil men and deal with them accordingly but what we must truly guard against what we must fear most beat is the indifference of good men
the macmanuses turn and walk out the door
the boys put on their dark glasses and pause at the top of the steps to light up their cigarettes
they both roll their cigarette butts along their tongues and screw them into their lips
in this unique way they light up seemingly oblivious to their synchronicity and mimic
irish accent i do believe the monsignor finally got a point
irish accent aye
murphy wearing a white blood soaked smock and apron stands around the corner of the entrance to the loading dock
he grips a gigantic bloody slab of meat and smirks
connor flips his cigarette out the loading dock and passes his brothers hiding place
he notices the workers have stopped and are looking at him
murphy slaps connor square in the face with the bloody slab
connors face is caked with blood as he stands stunned
he then leaps on murphy sending him into a pile of nearby hamburger
he grabs a large cow tongue from a nearby heap and begins slapping murphy in the face with it as they both laugh and the workers cheer
their boss mcgerkin approaches with a very large woman
her head is clean shaven
the two are still laughing out of breath they turn
boys this is rose baum gurtle
youll be training her today and do a good job
wipes hand and extends it pleased ta meet ya rozie
she points to a tattoo on her neck that reads untouched by man
i prefer to be called rozengurtle by men
taken aback okay then
lets get ya started
connor exits with roz
christ thats the largest woman ive ever seen
its self imposed affirmative action
if we hire big fat angry lesbians then the leftist groups representing big fat angry lesbians wont think were violating their rights
well how politically correct you are
thats good stuff
hey those people can shut ya down
theyll sue you into the ground claiming they were put under mental duress inner pain
well as long as were hirin fat lesbians give your ma a call
murphy laughs as he jogs away
fuck you murphy
rozengurtle and connor stand in front of a bunch of co workers who are cutting meat as it goes by on assembly
okay just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb here is
rule of thumb
do you know where that term comes from
in the early s it was legal for men to beat their wives as long as they used a stick no wider than their thumb
connor holds up his thumb and stares at it
cant do much damage with that
perhaps it shoulda been the rule of wrist
he elbows her rule of wrist
she returns an icy stare
he hands her the knife
the co workers all seem wary of roz
murphy stands on one side of roz connor on the other surrounded by a tight group of workers
everyone is within ear shot of one another cutting meat as it goes by
knowing glances are shared by everyone
it is an uncomfortable mood
slight smirk how many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb
one ta screw it in and one ta suck my cock
everyone burst out laughing
rozengurtle jabs a knife in a piece of meat and turns to connor
she pushes him and starts walking toward him
he starts backing up laughing
angry i knew you two pricks would give me problems
give me shit cause im a woman
im not gonna take your male dominance bullshit
trying to calm her but still chuckling oh come on now rozengurtle
i was just tryin ta get a rise outta ya
just tryin ta break the ice is all
to murphy fuck you
to connor and fuck you
oh come on its st
its all in good fun
employees gather around all the excitement
baumgartner sound irish to you fuck face
now look rozengurtle were sorry
she reaches back and punches connor full force in the face
he takes the hit very well
he stops backing up
why dont you save all your aggression for protests and marches and what not
she suddenly drives her boot into his crotch sending him to the floor reeling with pain
two female co workers leap to his aid
you fuckin slaves
kowtowing to the needs of men
get the fuck up
leave him there
rozengurtle begins to turn raising her fist to murphy
murphy winds up and punches her square in the face
she lands on her back
the on lookers are stunned as he walks over and stands above her
guess youll have ta change that tattoo now wont ya rozie
the brothers get to the top of the stairs
connor is hunched over and moving slowly
connor flicks his cigarette butt out the large open loading doors at the end of the hall
the red brick buildings stretch down the alley both ways
the glowing butt falls to a filthy resting place directly next to a dented green dumpster with half the paint job scraped off
this is a decrepit illegal loft
the boys enter hang their rosaries by the door and begin taking off their clothes
connor sits naked on the couch and gently places a bag of ice on his crotch
murphy stands naked in the open quantity shower
murphy turns on the water and sticks his hand in the stream
connor still seated cracks open a guinness and sips it lovingly
the phone rings
connor is that you
something is obviously wrong in her voice
interested mother is that you
is that worthless brother of your there
i want you both ta hear this
ma whats wrong
murphy shuts off the water
no fuckin hot water man
murphy sees the concern in connors eyes and takes a step closer
its all your fault
both you little bastards
i was a fool to believe you would bring me any peace
the day your da left us when you were almost too young to remember he said the two of you would do me right and make me proud but he
was wrong and i got nothin ta live for
mother what are you sayin
youre talkin crazy here
murphy is drawing closer with concern
whats the matter with her
a wrinkly female hand grabs a large revolver resting next to a half empty bottle of hennessey
i finally found your das army revolver connor
what the hell are you doin with das gun
widening eyes what the
i got it ta my head now
i got it ta my head now
what are you doin
i want ta tell ya one last thing before i pull the trigger
screaming pull the trigger
have ya lost it woman
now just calm down here
eyes widen oh my god
oh jesus no
connor and murphy are both screaming in panic
mom stands on the back stoop holding the door ajar with her hip
she holds the phone receiver up in her left hand and the gun directly next to it in her right
she squeezes off a loud shot toward the heavens
as soon as the deafening sound pierces through the receiver connor instinctively jumps up to a standing position
the bag of ice bursts as it hits the floor and spreads across it
he throws the receiver and covers his ears with both hands
the phone then falls to the ground skipping through the cubes as the boys dive for it screaming
the two naked hysterical boys fumble for the phone flailing on their stomachs in the field of ice
they finally catch it and both put their ears to the receiver in panic
as they scream ma intermittently the pauses get longer and longer
moms got her hand covering her mouth face red from holding back laughter as she walks back into the house
she can take it no longer and she bursts out with hearty guffaws
the boys are relieved but angry
grabs his balls rolls over aaaww shit
lord have mercy
that was a good one ma
murphy holds the receiver in the air
moms still laughing
to connor oh shes quite proud of herself
okay seriously both you listen ta me now
they both put an ear to the phone
all right were both here
mom pauses and cackles endlessly once again
finally its only here boys so i got lots more drinkin ta do with your worthless relatives down at the anvil

the boys stand shoulder to shoulder naked
they peer into the distance ears to the phone awaiting this most important information
are ya ready
slight pause as mom slams a shot of hennessey
yells the one with the biggest cock
mom slams down the phone and lets out a throaty laugh
the boys sign angrily
connor walks over and hangs up the phone
when he turns he notices murphy is fixated on his brothers crotch
a triumphant smile spreads across his face
ive had ice on mine
paul smecker f
agent is lead by the boston chief of police through a jungle of ravenous reporters police lines and uniformed officers
he is impeccably dressed in a deep red suit
he is smiling confident as he walks
he is a very good looking slender man
he looks intently for a moment at four uniformed officers
they approach two dead bodies laying next to a dented green dumpster with half the paint job scraped off
one man ivan checkov lays on his stomach closer to the dumpster than the other
the ass of his pants has been burnt out and a large cotton bandage is in its place
the other vladdy has a blood soaked bandage around his head and is on his stomach as well
there are hundreds of pieces of porcelain of various sizes everywhere
three plain clothed homicide detectives duffy dolly and greenly hover close to the bodies
dolly and duffy listen to greenly an obvious rookie give his over confident theory of what took place
the chief is about to interrupt them but smecker holds him back with a smile
the two wait and watch in a position where the unsuspecting detectives have their backs to them
thick boston accent so these guys are just kickin the shit out of each other
this guy points to vladdy picks up an old kitchen sink that some one threw out and crushes this guy checkov with it
all right so it makes a big bang and alerts their friend whos standin look out around the corner
so he comes over and gets into it with this guy vladdy hes angry at him right
they get into an altercation in which the look out guy crushes this guy by jumpin on him
and look at the damage here
vladdy i mean this guys fuckin hamburger man
his spine is crushed
hes all twisted and shit
that guy had to be one big mother fucker
huge pounds fuckin huge
the chief is embarrassed
check this out
say these two dont even know the huge guy
theyre just staggerin home from a bar this morning still all fucked up from st
pattys last night
so they figure theyll take a short cut down the alley and this big mother fucker hes just waitin
and what could be more perfect for strong arm robbery
two drunk guys all bandaged up
theyre already injured for christ sakes
he takes a blunt object and whacks the guy with the bandage on his head right
cause hes smart
he knows the guy with the bandage on his ass he aint going nowhere
matter of fact this guys probably helping his friend with the rectal problem along
theyre limping around like a couple of decrepit old broads
so once this guys out of the picture denotes vladdy this poor asshole he tries to run
but look how far he gets fore the huge bastard catches up with him
only a few yards
and what does he do
he gets creative
he picks up a sink and crushes the poor mother fucker
then he aint done yet
he comes over here jumps on this guys back and crushes him to death
vladdy he steals their shit and beats it
thanks for comin out
beat and look at this print
greenly points out a large foot print on vladdys back
some detectives nod in agreement
smecker chuckles as he shakes his head
thats one big fuckin shoe
and think about it
of all the ways to kill a guy crushin him to death
thats very particular
you dont get many of those
i feel something big here
i wouldnt be surprised if we see more of these turning up
stepping into the open brilliant
so now we got a huge guy theory and serial crusher theory
top fucking notch
to greenly whats your name
who the fuck are you
smecker saunters up to greely and pulls his i
out of the breast pocket of his sport coat and lets it hang
the large light blue letters f
can be easily seen
thats who the fuck i am
all the detectives seem disgruntled and look to the chief for an explanation
listen i gotta go by the numbers on this one
just came back on these guys
theyve got connections to the russian mob
that makes it a federal matter and agent smecker here is heading up the investigation with our full cooperation
transfixed on greely why dont you get me a cup of coffee
what the fuck
twist of lemon
to chief chief what the fuck is this
sweet n low
greenly looks helplessly to the chief who simply nods
he storms off the scene upset
smecker turns his back on everyone and puts earphones in
he reaches down and hits play
the choir song agnus dei overtakes
he begins to investigate
he kneels at the bodies for a moment then stares at the opposite brick wall
he picks up a piece of porcelain and scrapes it with his thumb
he quickly cocks his head toward the sky and begins to chuckle as he says jesus christ under his breath
he brushes some paraffin on each of the dead mens hands
duffy and dolly watch defiantly
they start to smile at one another as they collectively realize his homosexuality
he is slightly effeminate buy not overly fey
loudly mitchell langley
two uniformed officers approach
find the manager of this building
see if he has had any complaints of water coming down in any apartments starting just this morning
if hes not there knock on every door starting from the third floor up
langley you take this building same thing
mitchell and langley exit
two more uniforms approach
to chaffey look in the trash around their hands
see if you can find me two bullet casings
s if my eye serves me right
dont disturb them
mark them as they lay
newman root through this shit
points to the mountain of garbage if this was a sink find me some metal parts
gimme a faucet or a drain cover or something
the two begin their tasks
chaffey finds a casing near checkovs hand hidden under the edge of the pile
the homicide detectives are surprised as chaffey looks for the second shell
smecker lights up a smoke
chief could you get ballistics down here and tell them they have to dig a slug out of a brick wall
he points to a bullet hole in the opposing and tattered wall
and locate another thats been fired through a dumpster
he points to another bullet hole at the dumpsters base
i got the best ballistics guy in the world
got all his stuff right in the van
can have him down here in minutes
how did you know that
paraffin came up positive
and bullet holes are usually a big clue
i cant find the second one sir
look under the body
obeys got it
smecker turns to detectives with a smirk
you guys ready for this
they both nod
this was no gangland assassination
though creative it was way too sloppy
something went wrong here
this has personal written all over it
now these men were crushed and the first natural reaction the body has to such trauma is to tense up
so now the two shots fired here were reflex rounds
these guys werent shooting at anything but they were just about to
agent smecker pointing to macmanus building this is all illegal loft housing so theres no manager on the premises but i found a lady on the fourth floor said shes
had water dripping down on her whole place
started just this morning
fourth floor huh
then were heading to the fifth
lets go up and see just how right i am
the detectives pile into the elevator smecker last
greenly has rejoined them
smecker sips his latte
so what are you thinkin here
really want to know
all the detectives chant the affirmative
the doors close
as the doors open all the detectives chorus their disbelief
you know how big a guys gotta be to do that
smecker turns to greenly in disbelief
i might be wanting a bagel with my coffee
smecker exits the elevator leaving the three silent detectives with that thought
to dolly i aint getting him no fuckin bagel
the detectives exit the elevator
smecker appears first glancing in momentarily
the detectives pile in behind him
they survey the situation in total awe
to greenly well start the ass kissing with you
smecker saunters out detectives on his heels
approaches smecker agent smecker
i know this neighborhood pretty good
theres a bar called mcgintys down the block
its a good bet they were there last night
turns to detectives good work mitchell
ill check that out myself
duffy starts walking down the street
a reporter is hot on his heels
what the fuck happened here
you owe me
this is the one i want
lets go get a cup of coffee
you aint gonna fuckin believe this one
smecker is standing on the front steps in front of uniformed officers and homicide detectives
i want a
s put out
i want more uniforms on the streets
one things for sure wherever these guys are theyre hurting
a potent song takes our ears as the macmanus brothers sit in the e
they have already received care
their faces are beaten and there are bandages and dried blood in various spots
connors injuries exceed murphys
they are both clad in only their leather boots boxer shorts and worn out old bathrobes
young kids wait for medical attention as their knife wounds bleed
two nuns in the corner console a third whose robes are ripped and face is beaten
a woman toward the end of the hall is so badly beaten she is unrecognizable
as the song builds to a more harrowing chorus a man enters
his clothes suggest hes a pimp
he is not injured
he looks around as he stands perturbed at the end of the hall
he reaches over and grabs the beat up woman by the hair and begins to drag her out
she is kicking and screaming from the floor grabbing at his wrists as he hauls her away
slo mo the boys instantly furious stand and begin to go toward the action but connors legs give out on him and he falls to the floor
connor still trying to go after the pimp crawls towards him
murphy helps his brother to his chair and hold him tight
just calm down
take it easy
hell have his day
hell have his turns music fades
an old irishman enters the e
has a serious facial twitch and is prone to blinking uncontrollably
he has a mild stutter
he also has tourettes syndrome and is apt to yell his two chosen swear words every now and then first fuck
and after a slight pause ass
he rushes up as they stand to greet him
murphy holds connor up
thanks for comin doc
irish accent squeaky voice j jesus
what the fuck happened
are ya b boys all right
agent came by the bar
he left me his c c he left me his c c he left me this
he hands them a card with smeckers name on it
they survey it with interest
extremely loud fuck
everyone in the e
looks at doc in shock
connor and murphy dont even avert their eyes from the card
what are you going to do
were going to turn ourselves in
it was self defense
y y yeah thats what he said
how the fucks he know that
we havent spoken to anyone yet
he didnt say
the boys look puzzled
murphy helps connor down to his seat
listen doc we need a favor
murphy hands doc a partially filled garbage bag
hold this shit for us doc
well be comin back for it when we get out
doc exits say one more fuck
ass on the way out
the station is abuzz with the story
connor and murphys names are on all tongues
a legend starts
every available officer is in the room along with the homicide detectives
smecker walks right down the middle
first of all id like to thank whichever one of you donut munching barrel assed dip shits leaked this to the press
thats just what we need now some sensational story in the papers making these guys out to be super heroes triumphing over evil
and let me squash the rumors now
these two arent heroes
rolls his eyes they are two ordinary men who were put in an extraordinary situation and they just happened to come out on top
yes nothing from our far reaching computer system has turned up jack shit on these two
all we know is what we found out from their neighbors
and the general consensus is that theyre
pause but angels dont kill and we got two bodies in the morgue that look like theyve been
smecker looks to greenly
dripping with sarcasm
serial crushed by a huge fuckin guy
some of the cops and homicide detectives laugh and chide greenly
are these me considered armed and dangerous
well not armed
if they had guns theyd have used them
what makes you think theyre dangerous
they were just protecting each other
the two are limping up the precinct stairs
connor is draped over murphy who helps his brother along they are still attired as in the e
im not saying one way or the other
just be careful and go by the protocol on this one
any tips on where these guys may be
to officer mitchell any word back from the e
no help at all
swamped from st
packed with drunk bloody irish
just hit the bricks nice and hard
grunt police work is going to bring this one in
talking loudly these guys are miles away by now
the brothers quietly enter in the back of the room
all the officers are seated with their backs to them
smecker and the brothers make eye contact
he knows who they are
they dont interrupt greenly
but if you want to beat your head against a wall then heres what you look for
these guys are scared like two little bunny rabbits
anything in a uniform or flashing blue lights will spook them
so the only thing we can do is put a potato on a string and drag it through south boston
there is light chuckling from the police at this crack
loud youd probably have better luck with a beer
everyone turns and looks
the boys sit in two chairs at a plain table with a recording device on it
they are very serious and alert
mitchell enters with coffee for them
he shakes their hands and says he really respects what they did
surprised they thank him
chaffey enters with donuts and a repeat performance of respect
slowly officers start to gather around the interrogation room door
there are at least officers and detectives packed in the tiny room
the macmanus visit with the excited cops
all are in high spirits
the room is loud as smecker walks in
what the fuck is this
this isnt a fuckin tea party
only thing i want in here is them
they all file out
smecker and the boys look each other over
this conversation is going to be recorded
just answer to the best of your knowledge
smecker reaches for the record button
murphy puts out his hand to stop him
politely excuse me sir
murphy turns to his brother and speaks in latin in hushed tones
it is subtitled in english
what do we tell him about the guns and money
we just got up and left
bum musta rolled them before the police got there
to smecker okay
smecker in intrigued with this tiny display
he hits the record button
you guys are not under oath here
i am assuming you knew these two guys from before huh
met them last night
they had some pretty interesting bandages
know anything about that
they look at each other
mcgintyss is packed to the walls with drunken irish
a lot of faces are recognizable from nolands meat
connor is in front of the bar
he and doc are staring at each other as if waiting for one man to give in
connor has his arms across the chests of murphy and some friends holding them in place
they are interested in the competition
presently imitating docs voice would someone please come over here and
me up the
everyone falls down laughing
doc is angry and starts throwing ice at them
david della rocco makes his way through the crowd
rocco is thirty two years old
he has shoulder length dark hair and a full beard and mustache that wrap around his big smile
he charges up to the bar and yells to doc
get me a beer
this sends everyone even further into laughter
doc throws two huge fists full of ice at him
he backs away laughing
the boys get up off the floor and have a huge group hug with rocco as they all scream each others names
they all laugh and commence drinking
the bar is trashed
its mostly empty now except for the brothers rocco doc and four friends
everyone is very drunk including doc
trying to connect with connor its not that im homophobic
im just afraid of faggots
connor pauses then bursts out laughing
doc calls everyone to gather round
i got some bad news
looks like im gonna have ta close d down the bar
the russians have been buying up buildings all over town including this one
and theyre not letting me renew my lease
i got til the end of the week to come up with dollars or they take the place
i left them a note telling them not to show their faces t tonight
they been pressuring me ta close and take the last few days ta get all my shit outta here but its my right to stay open ta the last
long pause as everyone absorbs
they are upset
let me talk to my boss may i can
he is cut off by everyone who obviously opposes mafia involvement
l l listen i dont want anyone ta know until the last possible moment
so you guys keep your traps shut
ya know what they say people in glass houses sink ships
everyone has quizzical looks on their faces
yknow doc i gotta get you a a like a proverb book or something
this mix and match shits gotta go
imitating doc a p penny saved is worth two in the bush
imitating doc dont c cross the road if ya cant get out of the kitchen
everyone laughs heartily
just then three large russians in suits enter
the obvious leader checkov stands in front with vladdy behind one of checkovs shoulders with another guy behind the other shoulder
they mean business
the laughter fades
thick russian accent i am ivan checkov
you will be closing now
after a long pause this is mccoy
we find spock and we got enough for an away team
ivan is angry
oh how extraordinary
a bunch of irishmen
and they are being drunken idiots
you are killing the stereotype
im in no mood for discussion
points to doc you
the rest of you go now
why dont you make like a tree and get the fuck outta here
the locals roll their eyes at docs blunder
calm down doc
im sure theyre reasonable fellows
he and murphy each grab a guinness and a shot of hennessey and they approach the russians with the peace offering
listen fellas yknow hes got til this weeks end
ya dont have ta be hard asses do ya
yeah its st
everyones irish tonight
now why dont ya pull up a stool and have a drink with us
you insult me
i would never drink that sewage
especially with you people
you are fools
checkov slaps the beer to the floor
this is no game
if you wont go we will make you go
the boys look at each other remembering what mom said
they still hold the shots
if ya want a fight you can see youre outnumbered
were trying ta be civil here so i suggest you take our offer
i make the offers ass hole
rocco pushes off the bar
hes had enough
standing between the two brothers hey there boris
what would you say if i told you that your pinko commie mother sucked so much dick
ivan punches him in the face
he is quickly down and out
connor and murphys faces turn to stone as they speak the next few lines in flawless fluent russian with english subtitles
now that wasnt too polite was it
im afraid we cant let that one go ivan
checkov is completely taken aback
all the irish are fairly impressed as well
i dont think ma would mind
they clink the glasses together throw back the hennessey ball up the thick glasses in their fists drop to one knee and both deliver a devastating blow to each of
murphy on the left connor on the right
hes down for the count writhing on the floor
the boys each take a russian guy and start fighting as the others start kicking and spitting on checkov
this is a bar brawl lots of punches dont connect
connor dismantles his man quickly
murphy is still fighting as all the irish try to jump in and help murphy but connor goes into psycho mode pushing them all back
let the boy go
he knows what the fuck hes doing
they all back off and start to cheer him on
murphy and vladdy are ripping each other apart
vladdy backs him against a wall and pulls back exhausted for one good punch
murphy reaches up behind his head with both hands and pulls two bottles of wine from a wall rack
he swings them toward each other with vladdys head as the mid point
the bottles haphazardly connect one on each side of his head
he crumples to the ground in an explosion of glass and wine
there is shock and silence
nicely done boy
they have ivan checkov tied down to the bar on his stomach
connor stands with an unlit cigarette dangling from his lips next to ivan
he pours hennessey all over checkovs buttocks
they all cheer
ivans face is battered as rocco wakes and approaches
he punches checkov in the face in complete rage
two friends subdue him as all chuckle
now like my fine brother says on st
pattys everyones irish
and this piece of shit is about to be initiated
as they cheer connor lights up his smoke and tosses the match on ivans butt
the hennessey is instantly ablaze and checkov is screaming and wiggling in horror
some just stand there stunned but most of the remaining onlookers leap to ivans aid
they furiously pat him out and turn on connor
are ya tryin ta kill him ya fuck
connor and murphy fairly beat up sit up on their beds
they wear tattered bathrobes and boxer shorts
they put their feet down into their leather boots
the boys examine the extent of one anothers injuries and reflect on their hangovers
they both laugh and grab their heads in pain
the door breaks open and in hobbles checkov and vladdy guns drawn
checkov is all beat up and the ass of his pants is burnt out
a bulky bandage covers his buttocks
vladdy has a large bandage around his head
the boys stand in surprise
ivan smashes connor in the forehead with his gun sending blood gushing down his face as he falls to the floor
murphy helplessly yells his brothers name as he is brought to his knees by vladdy
ivan positions connor on his knees before the toilet which is open to the room
checkov puts his foot on connors head and proceeds as he struggles to hand cuff him to the old toilet
so now connor is bleeding and hugging the commode with his hands cuffed behind the bowl base
almost whispering i was going to kill you
but im not
im going to kill your brother
im going to take him down to the dumpster and im going to shoot him in the head
then im going to throw his dead body in the garbage
looks at this watch trash guys are coming in minutes gotta go
checkov walks towards the door and says lets go to vladdy
it was just a bar fight
you guys are fuckin pussies
vladdy pulls him to his feet and leads him away following checkov
connor blood running from his face listens to absolute silence for just a moment
suddenly his face reads the gravity of the situation
in a split second he turns into an animal
hes yelling pulling tugging and growling
his body is a whirlwind of motion
the skin on his wrists bleeds profusely
vladdy and checkov lead murphy out back into the alley
murphy is on his knees next to the dumpster
checkov has his gun to the boys head
he acts like hes going to pull the trigger but he stops
vladdy is standing twenty feet away with his back to them keeping a look out gun in hand
connor becomes so venomous that he pulls the entire toilet right out of the floor
slo mo connor steps out onto the sill of the huge open loading doors
he is five stories up
his muscles ripple with the weight of the toilet
his face is barbaric
from his kneeling position murphy can see his brother perched feet overhead
he does not let his face betray him
i hope your conscience is clear irishman
slo mo connor bends his knees and heaves the toilet upward and swings one arm directly beneath it
he is no longer tethered around the basin
he holds it at a cocked angle
the heavy porcelain tank cover slips off the toilet
he tosses the toilet in a left and outwardly trajectory then he jumps off the sill to the right
he is sailing through the air about twenty feet behind and to the right of the toilet cuffed hands above his head robe up like a cape behind him
murphy screams slo mo checkov begins to laugh heartily
the tank top lands pristinely on a garbage bag just behind murphy
ivans look turns to one of terror
he is crushed by the toilet
his gun goes off punching a hole in the dumpster near the bottom
vladdy hears the bang and crouches as he turns to see a wave of tiny porcelain bits
connor lands squarely on vladdys back
his gun discharges firing a hole in the brick of the opposing wall
he is savagely crushed against the ground
connor bounces off and hits the wall landing in the garbage completely unconscious
murphy takes his hands from his head
there is dead silence
he runs to his brother pulls him from the trash and checks his vital signs
he seems okay
vladdy still alive slowly crawls for his gun inadvertently covering his own bullet casing
murphy goes over picks up the tank cover and clubs the man to death with two hard and fast blows then throws it up and behind him
it lands in the dumpster with a resonating boom
murphy quickly takes everything from the scene guns money wallets watches and a pager
he shoves it in a garbage bag and throws connor over his shoulder and runs out of the alley
smecker stares astounded at connor and murphy
the boys examine smecker for a reaction
he slowly builds to a chuckle
the brothers join in
gathering himself so how is it that you guys are fluent in russian
we paid attention in school
know any other languages
our mother insisted on it
murphy speaks flawless french with subtitles
subtitled how do you think he figured all this out without talking to us
connor speaks flawless italian with subtitles
subtitled i have no idea
maybe someone saw and talked
subtitled not in our neighborhood man
a hundred percent irish
no one talks to cops
subtitled then i guess hes just real
what are you guys doing working at a fucking meat packing plant
the brothers laugh
ah agent smecker we have a problem
the press is everywhere outside
theyre going nuts for these guys
what do you want to do
youre not being charged
its up to you
do you want to talk to them
no pictures either
well we could try the bag over the head thing
walk you right out the front
our mother can see through bags
aye she can
beat any way we can stay here
sure we have an empty holding cell they can
can they stay
well well have to check with your mother but its ok with me if your friends sleep over
they all chuckle
chaffey is embarrassed
time to feed the dogs
hes a nice guy
murphy speaks with the characteristic gay mans lingering yes
the police chief is standing on the front steps of the police station making a statement to the ravenous press cameras and pushy reporters
agent smecker stands slightly behind him
rocco stands amidst the sea of reporters as the chief begins
this is our official statement
the macmanus brothers are not being charged with a crime
it was a clean cut case of self defense
we have thanked them for their cooperation and we thank you the media for your tireless pursuit of the truth
the press is ablaze with questions
smecker turns and walks down the precinct steps passing rocco who carries a bunch of folded clothes and heads for the police station
smecker glances in roccos direction barely noticing the man who has already passed him
rocco approaches the wide open cell as chaffey and mitchell play cards with the brothers
happy to see each other the boys and rocco embrace
he hands them their clothes
the boys are in a tight cell with a bed on each side
they are in their own clothes now
the brothers are fast asleep
suddenly they lurch forward throwing their chests out lips tight still asleep
an officer turns on the faucet of a sink and begins to wash his hands
we go down to the pipes beneath the porcelain basin
an old leak seeps water through a crack in the floor
a water leak starts on the ceiling
it drips faster and faster
the water begins to follow a water damaged crack along the ceiling
it slowly spreads in two directions
the brothers struggle for air in their sleep
then slowly and at the same time they each reach up one arm apiece and simultaneously curl their hands as if grabbing something
their straining faces are brought from darkness to light as they sit up quickly face to the ceiling
their eyes open wide and they each draw their first breath as drops of the creeping water land on their foreheads
they look at each other across the room in shock as the drips of water still fall between them
destroy all that which is evil
so that which is good may flourish murphy and connor sleep
murphy awakes to a beep beep beep
he removes checkovs pager from the pocket of his bathrobe
connor and murphy enter as greenly dolly duffy chaffey and mitchell are having coffee and donuts
they greet each other warmly
connor grabs a pen and walks to the hallway
be right back
we would be honored sir if you would join us peasants in a donut
duffy hands murphy a jelly donut and a cup of coffee as dolly spreads a copy of the boston globe in front of murphy
the headlines read the saints of south boston
all the detectives chuckle as murphy is momentarily absorbed
he takes the paper
beat i will not accept this pizzle until my feet have been properly anointed
connor cradles the receiver of a pay phone between his cheek and shoulder
he pockets the pager
as the phone rings he readies his pen
the other end of the line picks up and a thick russian accent instantly begins speaking
connor responds by speaking a few words in russian before he realizes its a recorded message
he begins writing
he hangs up the phone and smiles as he lights up a cigarette
rocco still sporting a shiner enters an office
there are papers everywhere and it is a cluttered mess of telephones filing cabinets lamps and chairs
rocco clutches a brown paper bag as if it is made of gold
poppa joe yakavetta roccos boss is on the phone
he is in his late forties
hes always comfortably dressed sleeves rolled up collar unbuttoned
vincenzo lipazzi swaggers across the office to rocco
he is in his late thirties
he goes out of his way to look like elvis open shirt gold chains and medallions
he is overweight and has a bouffant hairdo accompanied by elvis shades
vincenzo flips a half dollar in his hand constantly
rocco and vincenzo hate each other
yakavetta talks on the phone
hushed well its the funny man

a bit defiant joey bevo said it was important
said i had to give it to him myself
snatching the package gimme the fuckin thing
now sit the fuck down
rocco obeys like an angry child
vincenzo puts it in front of yakavetta
he sits on a filing cabinet and flips his coin
vincenzo giggles and whispers as he pokes fun at rocco
the two of them resemble kids behind the teachers back
hushed im rocco
im the funny man
im so fuckin funny

hushed tell me a joke funny man
i caught your show down at the velvet room at the holiday inn loved it when you busted into viva las vegas
vincenzos face drops he gets up and starts walking toward rocco
roc points at him from a seated position
hey hey hey
suddenly yakavetta jumps to a standing position
i could snap my fingers and have you dead in four hours rotting in a truck off of boyleston

he slams the phone down
rocco and vincenzo are shocked but try to look composed

as he speaks he unwraps the wax paper in the bag
rocco looks over his shoulder
its a sandwich
vincenzo smirks at him
poppa joe you want me to go now
rocco starts for the door
vincenzo begins whispering in yakavettas ear
hey rocco wait
come back here
vincenzo continues whispering for a few more seconds long enough for rocco to see
vincenzos lips are tight
his teeth grind
i always see you talking to the boys and making them laugh
they always come around telling me what a crack up you are
what is it they call you

yakavetta takes a long pause
continue the joke
deflated he says whats your third wish
and the guys says i i want you to beat me half to death
theres a long tense pause
suddenly yakavetta throws his head back and roars with laughter
vincenzo joins in
rocco lets out a semi audible sign of relief and gradually starts laughing himself
still in guffaw very good stuff rocco
very good stuff
tell me another one
rocco returns to terror
yakavetta erupts again pointing at rocco
connor and murphy give a huge irishman guns money and gold watches
he hands them two big black duffle bags and motions for them to help themselves as he counts the money
they enter a well equipped arsenal
they are giddy as they go on their first shopping spree
they toss in masks and gloves
they toss in four identical black finished mm handguns with silencers
know what we need man
charlie bronsons always got rope
yeah these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it
oh youve lost it havent ya
name one thing were gonna need it for
i dont know they just always need it
what is all this they shit
this aint a movie
connor pulls a large hunting knife from murphys bag
is that right rambo
all right get the stupid fuckin rope
paul smecker lies in bed with his young lover reuben mid twenties
he has an innocent feminine look and a gq air about him
the two have just had sex and reuben is far more excited about it than smecker
reuben pants and gestures that it was a wonderful experience
smecker watches tv
reuben reaches over and affectionately places a hand on smeckers chest
paul tosses it off with indifference
reuben has a pouty look
the phone rings
pause room number
reuben throws an arm over smeckers abdomen and places his head on pauls bare chest as if to now force affection
we got a time of death
he is visibly miffed with reubens sudden display
he tries to pull the arm away but reuben holds tight
sighs whats the body count
smecker is annoyed
he slaps reuben semi gently once on his exposed cheek
reuben closes his eyes and holds even tighter
he bites his lower lip in anger and smack reuben again on the same cheek hard
reuben jumps to a sitting position holding his cheek
he is shocked and hurt
ill be down there in a bit
keep the press out
he hangs up
immediately to reuben semi angry
what are you doing
beat i was just trying to cuddle
yelling what a fag
smecker saunters down the hall his usual confident smile
he is impeccably dressed in a brightly colored suit
greenly stands directly outside an open door at the halls end
a steady flow of detectives and forensics filter in and out
smecker halts before greenly and looks straight into his eyes
intrigued hes struck again hasnt he greenly
why do you always disrespect me like that
respect is earned greenly never given
guys like you should have to follow me around squabbling for the scraps from my table
smecker and greenly walk into a large sunken living room with high ceilings
there is a huge white shaped pit couch in the center with seven dead bodies draped across it
all the bodies have been turned so they are either seated or on their backs and bright new pennies have been place in their eyes
there is one corpse directly in the middle of the living room making eight
this victim the fat man is overweight and is lying in debris made up of sheet rock and broken wood which spreads thinly for a five foot radius around him
the victims body positions are in a circle with the fat man as the hub
smecker is instantly engulfed
the regular homicide detectives are on hand with their i
s hanging out of their breast pockets
they see smecker and back off
duffy wears an especially loud tie
smecker lights up a smoke
he circles around and sees another body behind the couch which makes nine
the victim is on his back with pennies stuck in his eyes
how many bodies greenly
still dejected eight
smeckers eyes widen as he turns to greenly
catching himself no
i didnt see that one
smecker takes a beat
he addresses the detectives
while greenlys getting coffee anybody else want anything
as he walks to the door shit
smecker surveys the scene
so duffy got any theories to go with that
looks down these guys were pros
i think they were coming for one target the fag man he was the
the what man
surprised the fat man
well freud was right
so you think they came for the fag man huh
and what do you base this upon
he was the only one done right
two in the back of the head
and the pennies
new hitman wants to leave his mark thats a possibility
yknow you boston cops are perking up
thats two sound theories in one day neither of which deal with abnormally sized men
pause another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent
some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead or silver
whats the symbology there
smecker tosses the idiot glance to dolly
well now that duffy has relinquished his king bone head crown i see we have an heir to the throne
im sure the word you were looking for was symbolism
whats the symbolism there
let me explain it to you
in greek and roman mythology when you died you would have to pay the toll to charon the boatman who ferried you across to the gates of judgment
this made sure the dead came to atone for what they did during their lives detective
smecker looks at his i
the detectives are impressed
youre the first one thats ever got that
aside yeah well
im an expert in name ology
the detectives chuckle
smecker is chain smoking
his clothes appear unkempt
his eyes show emotion at every new found clue
the detectives watch closely
he is hunched over the body of the fat man probing his wounds with his gloved fingers
greenly has re entered
he defiantly holds a cup of coffee but is too intimidated to interrupt smecker
he sets it down and folds his arms
ive seen burns like these before
they used silencers
look at these entry and exit wounds
he stands up and gives a lesson to the now eager detectives
he points his two index fingers to the back of his own skull
the two bullets went in here through the top of the skull criss crossed and exited through the eyeballs
this one clue tells us three distinct facts
they shot him at a downward angle
makes connection they put him on his knees
thinking hard shit i uh
it tells us that he was the last to die
all these men fans across the corpses with his hand were carrying
they came in dropped all in seconds and then took their time with fag man
didnt they duffy
psychotic laugh they sure as fuck did
a wide eyed duffy joins with smecker by nodding his head
smecker is seducing all of them
and number three dolly
fan fuckin tastic
greenly and duffy want to know how
now stay with me boys
what did they do to make two such identical wounds
did one guy put him on his knees pop a cap in sit him back up and shoot him again the same way
two men of similar height dropped this guy down each put some iron to his head and boom
thats all she fuckin wrote
what about one guy with two guns
possible but unlikely
the angles are too extreme
a guy holding two guns to the back of your head is gonna shoot straight ahead
he wouldnt cock out his elbows makes no sense
besides you telling me one guy came in here and killed eight men with eight extremely well aimed shots in just a few seconds
had to be at least two
smecker is now a complete mess
his hair is totally frazzled
he is sucking on cigarettes long and hard
his clothes are completely disheveled
television is the explanation for this
smecker points toward the ceiling revealing a huge gaping hole in it just above the living room
you see this is bad television
again pointing out the hole in the ceiling the little assault guys creeping in through the vents and coming in through the ceilings
that james bond shit never happens in real life
professionals dont do that
so weve got this up here which has novice written all over it
and all this down here thats simply a perfect textbook assassination
so heres our two possibilities
we either have rank amateurs that got lucky or consummate professionals that fucked up
the detectives nod in agreement
they are now completely taken in by smeckers spell
join me in a drink gentlemen
they go over and grab seats at the bar
smecker mixes himself a gin and tonic on the other side
he is calming down now and going back into cool mode
he starts to tuck his clothes back in and fix his hair
he leans over the bar and sips his drink
the three detectives lean in
with the exception of my coffee boy you boston detectives are starting to show signs of intelligence
so i am going to make you privy to some information that you would not normally be
these men are all russian mob
not like those two peons in the alley the other day
these guys are all syndicate bosses and underbosses
i have a dossier on every man in this room
since the iron curtain has gone down the russian syndicates have started to come here
and in the spirit of glasnost the soviets have opened their borders to the mafia
but the italians theyre not convinced that the grounds in mother russia are fertile enough for organized crime yet
so they aint ready to commit
the russians are coming here anyway
they are unwelcome
what we have here gentlemen is possibly the beginning of the first international mob war
unless ive totally missed something
all their faces read the gravity of the situation
now what is this going to look like to those who do not know what i just told you
its gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other
and is there an american shit is there a man seated among us that hasnt thought about it many times lets just put them all on an island give them
guns and let them kill each other
this is our wet dream come true
you can expect federal and local law enforcement to go only deep enough to satisfy the law then bury it from here on out
so what do we do now
you either do your job or get ethical
rocco comes out of the bathroom
he storms out to his small round living room table at which the boys are seated
he is wearing a white polyester shirt with gold trim that is a uniform of some kind for perhaps a chain of restaurants
it is unbuttoned all the way down and his white t shirt is hanging out
he is wearing a name tag that reads jaffar
he is upset
he slams down a chair across from the brothers who are sitting there cleaning guns and silencers
all the accouterments of death are sprawled before them
they are smoking as they carefully disassemble their firearms
this better be good
viciously ties his hair back talk
the boys look at each other
the boys are walking across copley square
connor looks at the note he wrote at the police station
they stand on the sidewalk and light smokes
they are in their regular garb thick naval p coats jeans and leather boots
they each carry a mid sized black duffle bag
they are serious and business like
they scan the plaza hotel from across the street
the elite exit and enter the hotel
connor glances at his pocket watch
they look ahead stone faced as the elevator climbs
the elevator stops at the lobby level
nine well dressed men enter
their faces are not shown
the boys move to the back wall
one guy says something quickly to another in russian
the other gives a one word russian response
they boys look at each other
as the elevator climbs their eyes focus
the door opens
as the men exit the elevator each face is seen individually all are victims from smeckers crime scene
the elevator goes up half a floor
they hit the stop button and rummage in their bags
they suit up black gloves and black masks
they strap on four mm
pistols with silencers in shoulder holsters one under each arm
connor takes a large coil of black rope and drapes it around himself
he looks at murphy and at the rope in his bag
murphy is too excited to argue
you and your fucking rope
he puts it on
they drop to their knees making the sign of the cross
then up through the ceiling they go
they stand on top of the elevator before a long air shaft
i told you thered be a shaft
smiling just like on tv
they jump into the air shaft
they start crawling with connor in front and murphy behind
the plump boss is standing in the middle of the sunken living room
his eight russian comrades are around him seated on the u shaped pit couch
they speak russian but no subtitles are seen
the fat man yells
hes mad about something
connor is taking lots of random turns left and right
he is starting to look a bit confused
the fat man is really yelling at them now
he is screaming and pointing at each man
they seem to be taking it seriously
their brows are drenched with sweat
murphy crawls up next to connor
there is only enough room for the two to lie on their sides facing each other
where the fuck are you going
well find it
just calm down
no fuck you
this rope is bullshit
im sweatin my ass off draggin this stupid thing around
must weigh pounds
murphy takes off the rope
were doing some serious shit here
now get a hold of yourself asshole
im not the rope totin charlie bronson wanna be thats getting us lost
connor grabs murphys shirt
no fuck you
the boys get into a close quarters battle
an occasional insult is thrown as feet kick and fists fly
they begin to get tangled in their own rope
the seam of the duct breaks and a tangled mess of rope and macmanuses pour out
they crash through the ceiling right above the fat mans head
the rope gets caught and slams the boys to a halt hanging them upside down back to back about six feet above the floor
they are turning in circles
the boss is balled up in the fetal position on the floor
the shocked russians say only a word or two in panic before the macmanus brothers react reaching for their guns
the russians start to reach for their guns
its too late
the boys draw and fire as they spin
taking four shots apiece
there are eight dead russians
chests explode as they fall back on the couch in a loose circle
one victims is blasted over the couch
they notice the fat man directly beneath them
murphy grabs his rambo knife reaches up and cuts the rope
they land in a heap scramble over to the doomed man and place him on his knees
they each put a gun to the back of his head and recite this prayer in perfect unison
and shepherds we shall be
for thee my lord for thee
power hath descended forth from thy hand that our feet may swiftly carry out thy command
so we shall flow a river forth to thee and teeming with souls shall it ever be
e nomini patri et fili e spiritu sancti
with the silenced pop from their guns we cut the sound and go to black and white
slo mo choral music starts with latin script being read in the background
they take their rosaries out
they slowly walk around mumbling prayers as they care for the dead
they gently turn over the bodies that were on their stomachs
they brush the hair back from the victims faces
they place pennies in the eyes of al the corpses
when they finish their ritual they pull off their masks and look at each other
they start to grin and look around
they work each other into a healthy chuckle
looks up that was some good fuckin rope
they both laugh
that was way easier than i thought
on tv ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch
yeah and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes
oh were good man
yes we are
they are already striding for a suitcase full of money
murphy picks up a wad of bills
i love our new job
just then theres a knock at the door
they snap into action
they stand at each side of the double doors looking through the peepholes
they see rocco on the other side dressed as a hotel employee
he wears a polyester shirt with gold trim and a name tag that reads jaffar
he has a good cart in front of him
they look at each other and grin
as they open the door murphy grabs the food cart and pulls it in
connor seizes the mortified rocco and pulls him in slamming the door shut behind him
they run dragging him and then throw him in the midst of the bodies
they put their guns right in his face
dont kill me
were on the same side
the boss musta sent you in as back up huh
oh shit please
im the funny man
almost crying they call me the funny fuckin man
attempting to hide accent wheres your gun
they take it shit
this is a six shooter
hiding accent nine bodies

poppa joe said there was only two
in and out
trying to make friends boy you guys sure did a good job
youre good huh
whered you get them
lets do him right here
screaming like a baby dont kill me
oh shit please no
im the funny man
the funny man
the boys put their faces close to his and demask
they start laughing but rocco just lays there wide eyed in shock
they boys saunter to the bar
rocco takes a long beat
what did you do
what the fuckin fuck
who the fuck fucked this fuckin
how did you two fuckin fucks
certainly illustrates the diversity of the word
the brothers laugh
what the fuck are you doing here
slaps his face get a hold of yourself man
rocco is silent and surprised
murphy also surprised looks at rocco
all is quiet
yeah get a hold of yourself
murphy jokingly slaps rocco a second time
rocco instantly jumps on murphy cursing and punching
the brothers burst into laughter as they subdue rocco
as he calms down they release him
listen we gotta get outta here now
well take separate exits and meet at roccos
murphy puts the two suitcases in his duffle bag and the two brush by rocco who is still unsatisfied with his explanation
rocco has removed his hotel jacket
anybody you think is evil
dont you think thats a little psycho
a little weird
know what i think is weird
decent men with loving families go home every day after work
they turn on the news and see rapists murderers and child molesters all getting out of prison
mafiosos getting caught with kilos and walkin on bail the same day
little girls catchin stray bullets in their heads playin hopscotch in their front yards
and everyone thinks the same thing
someone should just go kill those motherfuckers
kill em all
admit it even youve thought about it
rocco ponders this as the boys continue to clean their weapons
you guys should be in every major city
the boys chuckle
rocco steadily works himself into a humorous frenzy
this is some heavy shit
this is like lone ranger heavy man
theres so much shit that pisses me off
you guys should recruit cause i am sick and fuckin tired of walkin down the street waitin for one of these assholes to get me yknow
chuckling hallelujah jaffar
so youre not just talkin mob guys
youre talkin anyone right
even like pimps and drug dealers and all that shit
the boys look at each other and nod
well fuck you guys could do this every day
were like eleven
we aint always doing business but were always open
the three are partying hard
theres a pizza surrounded by guinness cans as they whoop it up sitting at the round table
rocco wears one of the masks
theyre all drunk
the house cat is lounging on the table comfortably
you fuckin guys
you ruined me
im fuckin done
permanent package boy
who says that
you could take credit on it
what are you serious
yeah fuck it
if you think about it its all you can do really
you cant tell him it was us
go in braggin and shit
climb the corporate ladder boy
im doing it
i deserve it
ive been working for those fat bastards since i was in high school and look at this place
the boys nod in agreement
working into a frenzy theyre fuckin me man
hey they can suck my pathetic little dick
and ill dip my nuts in marinara just so the fat fucks can get a taste of home while theyre at it
thats it its done im doing it
rocco slams his fist down on the table next to murphys gun
the gun goes off with a bang
and blows the lounging cat right off the table
a softball sized hole is blasted in the wall as a large splatter of blood sprays the area surrounding the hole
everyone is in shock for a second
i cant fuckin believe that just happened
the three are passed out all over the apartment
he stumbles past the wall with the large round pink stain on it
there is a crooked picture hanging in the middle of it
rocco staggers to the kitchen and throws water in his face over a sinkful of dirty dishes
connor awakens grabs his jacket and follows rocco out
hung over donnas gonna be angry about her cat
shes on every drug know to man
shed have sold that thing for a dime bag
beat but i do kinda feel like an ass hole
chuckles you sound real remorseful
connor lights up two smokes and hands one to rocco
she aint been around in weeks anyhow
somethings been bothering me about last night
what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there
in that room
what are you saying
think about it man
nine men six bullets
you think they sold me out
he probably knew youd end up nailing the fat guy maybe one or two more but he had to know you werent walking out of there
figure it out
shooters dead on the scene
no in depth investigation
itd slide right off his back
cause as much as i love ya youre not exactly don corleone
what would he be losing
a thirty five year old delivery boy
thats just not the way things are done
besides hows he know i dont just get in there see theres too many and just serve em their fuckin food and beat it
he knows you man
he knows all you want is to move up
a smooth hitter woulda gone in there seen it was a wash and slipped out
but a guy like you
knowin this is your only chance
waitin eighteen years
you dont know what youre talking about
i know these guys
i mean thanks for your concern but that just aint the thing of it
do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in
nothing needs to be rolled
murphy stumbles enters scene with rocco and connor

bye bye ya stupid son of a bitch

connor picks up the place as murphy watches t
the phone rings
anybody call for me
you sure youre okay
im fuckin fine
beat catch you on the flip side
rocco hangs up
just then donna and her friend rayvie enter the apartment
they are consummate junky sluts who are very doped up and giddy
trying hard here kitty kitty
smecker ascends the three small steps up to the round room
a nude dancer sits there on the couch in a robe
she is crying as she is being consoled by detective duffy
this small room is where men watch girls through a large glass window
in this room a dancer performs on a floor a few feet above the three private booths where each man watches from his own booth
she appears as if on stage
all three windows are shattered and there is blood on the wall of all three booths
we see assorted body parts in each booth but no faces
approaches smecker she was in here when it went down
can she i
they were wearing masks
of course they were
smecker looks at dolly surprised
only two did the shooting
beat so what are you thinking russian retaliation
nah too quick half their infrastructure got taken out at the copley plaza
besides if youre a hitter youre either working for the russians or the italians
theres no riding the fence
our little theory from last night just got blown to shit
new is going on here
smecker sits next to the girl
he has compassion
probably shouldnt work another shift for awhile
fuck this job
im getting out of the porno business and i dont care who i gotta blow to do it
the bodies have been removed and chalk outlines replace them
the bullet holes in the walls have been marked either a or b
the detectives watch smecker
he is a mess
his clothes are disheveled and his hair is frazzled
after talking to the dancer we know that their mark was the guy in the middle booth
after she watches them whack him she passes out
pause why the two extra victims
no way they could have seen it
smecker hits an orange button on the wall and a black steel door with a money slot comes slamming down in front of the first booth
he does the same thing to the last booth leaving the middle one open
both doors possess peep holes
sarcastic allow me to enlighten you gentlemen to the protocol of the porno industry as im sure youve never been in one of these places before
a man goes into the booth puts the money in the slot
the dancer gets it on the other side
she hits the button door goes up now there is only glass between you and its makes a masturbatory gesture with hand little fireman time
no way they could have seen it
those doors were down
which means this
they looked down in through the peep hole saw these guys and opened the doors from the inside
pop pop pop right through the glass
maybe the three of them had something in common
this guy is big time
points to middle booth these two are street walking scum
kidding then thats what they had in common
they were all bad guys
now theyre all dead bad guys
smecker seems side tracked and ponderous at greenlys observation
he hits the orange buttons and raises the doors
we got another thing to think about here
we got us a genuine kennedy assassination style bullet theory
two guns were used here guns a and b
the guy in the middle was done with both
but this guy
denotes right booth he was killed with bullets from gun a only
and this guy
denotes left booth gun b only
but ballistics dug two slugs out of the wall from over here where the victim was done with smecker points to two bullet holes in the wall of the booth
on the left
each is marked b
he walks over to the right booth where in the exact location are two identical holes marked a
and its the same story over here
why the crossover
thats just fucking weird
i have no idea
i just cant think anymore
that scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out
a guy went nuts over off of commonwealth today
shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight
fled the scene
dont have much on him
angry why was i not informed of this
they werent related
the guy used a
who were the victims
a couple of peons for the mob and
livid oh thats just beautiful
all the scumbags in the quiet city of boston start dropping dead and you think its unrelated
greenly the day i want the boston police doing my thinking for me i will have a fucking tag on my toe
now get me a squad car and get me over there
i want the crime scene photos and any witness statements
smecker storms from the room
the detectives begin to follow
smecker comes barreling back in shoving them out of the way
he looks at the bullet holes in the walls marked a and b again
something has clicked
wide eyed oh
it looks like we got us a cowboy
smecker surveys photos and papers as he smokes profusely
he stands next to a table in the back where chairs are knocked over
body chalk and blood stains are everywhere
the detectives seem like they dont want to be there again
the shooter knew these guys huh
how do you figure
they were friends
smecker flashes them a photo of a dead body
the victim is shot in the head and face down in his plate of food
his hands are on the table in front of him
these guys were packing
not one hand near a gun
its simple human behavior
someone you dont know approaches you you put your hand on it
this guys got his hands on the table
hes eating his food for christ sakes
they were friends
smecker looks over the bar
these two fucking scenes are related
too many coincidences
five hours apart
dead mobsters on both scenes
now why did he kill the bartender
crime of passion
he just went nuts
he would have shot everyone in here
he just ran out of bullets
this look like a fucking post office to you
this guy came in here with intent
maybe he didnt know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea
the bartender wasnt a fucking accident
well we didnt get any help on that
a lot of people saw it
look are you guys seeing the pattern here
we got big questions at both of these crime scenes with no answers
why did they kill the guys in the other two booths
why did he do the bartender
it would seem unnecessary even stupid
angry god i hate cold crime scenes
im fucking leaving now
and do me a favor tell me when the next guy dies cause these guys are not done yet
he storms to the entry way
smecker walks across the street still angry and goes to a payphone
theres an extreme close up on his hand as he puts in a quarter
as the quarter jingles in
there is a close up on a hand pulling back from the coin slot
the hand moves up to pull a cigarette from its possessors mouth
it is rocco
he dials the phone
anybody call for me
you sure youre okay
im fuckin fine
beat catch you on the flip side
he goes across the street and enters salamones
donna and rayvie are laying on the couch
connor is spit shining his boots by the window
murphy lights his cigarette on the gas stove and pours some salt in a pot of water with a handful of pennies boiling to a shine in it
rocco bursts through the door hysterical
tears are streaming down his face
pack your shit
we gotta get outta here
we gotta get out
hopping into his boots what happened
i killed em

rocco rummages through her purse and finds her car keys

rayvie and donna are hugging each other crying
i mean its not really

rocco is in the back
connor is driving
those rat fucks

rocco is standing at the back table while his cohorts remain seated
they are oly and vinnie

vincenzo came in here shooting his mouth off
he was makin sure we knew
but we did what we were supposed to eh
we kept our mouths shut

rocco looks at sal the bartender who reaches for the phone
vincenzo told sal first
that fat fuck knew before we did
they all start laughing together
at least we got our funny man back
they all laugh as rocco pulls his gun and shoots oly in the head
he lands face down in his plate of food
he shoots vinnie in the chest then turns on sal
he yells funny funny funny as he pumps the remaining rounds into him
anybody see ya
i may as well have posted flyers
right out in public man
liberating isnt it
smiles at last yknow it is a bit
the boys laugh
stop the car
connor pulls over directly in front of a pink neon sign that says the sin bin
vincenzo that fat motherfucker yakavettas right hand
hes the one who set me up
then he went around shooting his mouth off telling everyone i was as good as dead
he goes in there every wednesday night around he jerks off in the same booth to the same titty dancer
so lets kill the motherfucker
i mean what are you guys
like thats your new thing right
looks at murphy yeah well
oh what the fuck
how do you guys decide who youre
i mean who makes the cut

i guess we really dont have a system of deciding who
excited yelling meee
im the guy
i know everyone their habits where they hang out who they talk to
i know where they fuckin live
we could kill everyone
to connor so what do you think
im strangely comfortable with it
rocco connor and murphy are looking very serious as they smoke outside the rear door in the alley
a drug dealer in a hooded boston bruins jacket emerges from the opposing alley
he stops a year old kid
the kid is scared as the drug dealer slaps him
the kid give him money and the drug dealer stuffs a small baggie in the boys shirt
he lets him go and withdraws into the alley
as the boys and rocco watch this from the opposing alley they begin to head for them but vincenzos car pulls up across the street
rocco stops the boys and denotes vincenzo
the boys head in the front door
rocco moves back into the alley
vincenzo enters and shuffles past the bar where the brothers stand
he walks through a bead curtain at the back of the busy porno house
the boys follow him
they go to the back open the exit door and let rocco in
the three wind down long dark hallways with rocco leading the way until they reach a green door
the boys stand side by side directly in front of it
rocco is just behind them
the three pull identical mm
s and the boys pull on their masks
rocco puts on a mask that he made from a dock workers cotton hat
he looks ridiculous
okay roc this is
he turns and is instantly taken with laughter at roccos appearance
connor turns and has the same reaction
you guys got masks
they are now pointing and laughing
through laughter you look like mush mouth from fat albert
takes off mask fine
when were done she can i
i dont care
just tryin to be professional but no
still laughing no
it looks good
cmon put it back on
he begrudgingly puts it back on
they reassume their position
imitating mush mouth okay roc
you sure youre o b kay b
they burst into the room climb up a few steps and are in a small round room with a couch in it
a topless dancer sits smoking and drinking coffee on the couch in front of three big black steel doors with money slots in them
rocco seizes her puts a hand over her mouth and a gun to her head
which one is he in
she points to the middle door
takes his hand off her mouth whats his routine
he jerks off in there
then he puts money through the slot and i raise the door
she points to an orange button
each door has a button to the left of it
he watches me do my thing and f finishes himself off
we see the fuzzy reflection of a cheap porno movie being reflected in vincenzos elvis style sunglasses
he is shaking as he masturbates
grunting muttering dont you talk to me like that you dirty little
give it to daddy
give it ta da king
garbage mouth garbage mouth
rocco is looking through the peep hole down on vincenzo
he still holds the terrified crying dancer
he is some sicko
they back up and focus on the money slot
a hundred dollar bill comes through
connor gives it to the dancer
youve earned this
the boys begin to recite their prayer
rocco is smiling and excited he still hangs on to the now hyperventilating dancer
they press the button
the door goes straight up
vincenzo has one moment of shock before the macmanuses decimate him through the glass with silenced bullets
the glass silently spiders and begins to fall in spots
his chest explodes sputtering medallions and bits of gold chain inside the booth
the dancer faints and rocco lays her down gently
the boys step down in the boot and begin their ritual
rocco watches intently intrigued
they finish and turn around to see rocco is immersed in grabbing one of the unconscious dancers breasts
they pull up their masks
what the fuck are you doing
i ill tip her
weve teamed up with a sex offender
so when are you getting a plastic fuck doll
he gets up and starts tossing money on her as the boys giggle
just then two more bills come through the slots of the other two doors which have remained closed
murphy looks through left peep hole connor the right
smiles spread across their faces and they look at each other
they switch and each looks through the other guys peep hole
what is it
this place is like a scumbag yard sale
we gotta come down here once a week and clean house
rocco looks in one
he says oh wow as he crosses and checks out the other one
you sure about this guy
the boys look at each other affirmatively
you gotta let me do these guys
im such a moron
i gotta make up for the tit thing
ive been waitin for this asshole
i gotta clear my family name here
ive brought shame to the house of della rocco
give the guy a shot
thinks it over rocco this is the real deal
we must kill without hesitation without guilt or remorse
evil man dead man
rocco gets serious and nods his head
connor replaces the clip in his gun and hands it to rocco
murphy does the same
he stands with one in each hand aiming one gun at each door
the boys both place a finger on the appropriate orange buttons as rocco slowly cocks his head back
with wide eyes he thrusts his head forward
the doors fly up
rocco fires both guns yelling yeah take it take it
both the drug dealer from outside and the pimp from the emergency room are destroyed
rocco then crosses his arms and fires two more shots from each gun
on the opposing walls of each booth two identical bullet holes appear
wyatt fuckin earp man
rocco shuts the door
you guys gotta teach me that prayer man
thats some good shit
its a family prayer
my father his father before him that sort of shit
an old man appears to look at himself in the mirror of an empty but very upper class bathroom
his eyes are very glazed over
he puts a large leather case on the counter near the sinks
a red and white blind stick hangs off his right forearm
yakavetta enters crosses behind him and stands next to him
augustus years sniffs the air
a look of angry realization overtakes his face
hey augustus i need your help i got a serious problem here
im not screwing around
i bounced you on my knee at family reunions for christ sakes
your dad and me ran the whole east coast syndicate you snot nosed little prick
and when you took the wheel who was beside you
augustus begins to remove items from his suitcase
first a plate
he sets it down next to the sink
then assorted colognes cigarettes and chewing gum
he begins arranging them in neat rows always feeling with his guiding hands
hey i just
dont start with your shit
dont you talk to me
oh hey uncle gussy thanks for years of service
heres a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys shit eight hours a day
what am i a retired bus driver
i need il duce
beat what did you do
this kid this package boy could bring down the whole east coast
if he decides to turn states he could dismantle us
but it looks like for now hes content with just killing us one by one
and even worse the kid is good at it
i mean i had a prodigy on my hands the whole time and didnt even know it
yakavetta puts an envelope of money in the plate
listen kid i think you better understand who youre dealing with here
i was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him like he was a ghost or something
your dad and i used him three times over twenty years only when everything went totally fucked
believe me kid you dont want this guy unless you are sure you need him
a fuckin monster
this is a gigantic three tiered room with guards on all tiers
they all cock their shotguns
a prisoner is shackled barefoot to a small metal cart on wheels
his hands are cuffed before him with a chain linking his hands and feet
a guard is pulling the cart through the prison to the parole board room by a long chain
the cons have their mirrors out to get a better look
his face is in shadow as he bows his head
a metal cage is lowered around him from the ceiling
the parole board looks him over
a stenographer sits poised english accent do you feel you have been rehabilitated
no response is given by the prisoner
the stenographer looks at mr
cobb who gives her the nod
she begins typing though no words are spoken
ive had this guy in front of me and i couldnt tell you what he looks like sounds like
he is the picasso of assassins kid
he plants hair samples blood
puts skin under fingernails
he is a fucking genius
only one problem
hes been rotting in prison for twenty five or thirty years
dont even know if hes still alive
or if hes even up to it
augustus hands him a piece of paper he scribbled on
theres ways around that
go find one
a large piece of paper is placed on the table and stamped with the words parole granted across it
the prisoner il duce enters
he is clad in a long dark trench coat with the collar pulled up dark round glasses and a dark hat
he puts a suitcase on the bed
he walks over to the window
he slowly puts his hand outside and watches the sun bounce off it
tears begin to flow from beneath his glasses as he breaks down
he begins to take off his clothes as he weeps casting them aside
the duke is fully naked except for a hotel blanket which is wrapped around his waist sitting on the fire escape
he smiles and is still misty eyed as he beholds the sun setting
scattered around him are all the furnishings of freedom snickers bars all kinds of empty candy wrappers coke cans and many assorted magazines
rocco and the brothers sit in an old boston coffee house
lets talk some business here
i know a sick fuck
makes the ones we been doing look like altar boys
worst night of my life when i met this guy
rocco waits in a late model chevelle in front of a white house
a man exits the house and walks across the sprawling front lawn
rocco leans over and says how ya doin man
the man doesnt respond and sits in the passenger seat
during the following scenes we flashcut between bits of roccos experience that night to the coffee house and catch bits of dialogue as he explains
the guy never says a fuckin word to me
were driving for minutes
never a sigh no throat clearing nothing
and his face blank man
just nothing there
flashcut they pull up to a house in a scummy boston logan airport neighborhood
rocco gets out and sits on the hood smoking as the man makes his way up the walk
two tough looking wiseguys walk across a hallway cocking shotguns
they disappear into a room
flashcut he quietly enters the house and pulls a large bright blue plastic tarp from his coat and spreads it across the floor in the hallway
we hear the sound of sega video games being played
he pulls out two pistols with silencers and walk
he disappears into the living room
two white flashes and the sounds of silencers
a hookerish looking mom enters frame in the b
in the kitchen
she is talking on the phone
she disappears from view
the man reappears and walks to the kitchen
a white flash and the sounds of silencer
he walks right down the hall and halts right in front of us and listens
he goes into the room the wiseguys had entered
we hear a second of male voices in protest
two flashes of light and the sounds of silencers
a dog is heard barking
the man reappears in the hall and walks to its end through the kitchen
he opens a pair of sliding doors and steps out of our view
a flash of white light and the sound of a silencer
rocco is out front listening as the barks abruptly cease
flashcut the man drags a dead dog across the kitchen floor leaving a streak of blood
flashcut he drags the bodies of two kids two men and the woman down the hall toward us leaving the hall carpet streaked with blood
i didnt see what he was doing while he was in there
flashcut the man pulls out a large hunting knife and disappears into each room
the sounds of hacking are heard
he reappears holding different pieces of bloody debris
a telephone a piece of carpet pieces of drywall
he takes a mop and cleans off the blood on the linoleum of the kitchen floor
he walks toward us and stabs the mop in right before camera
it stays standing
flashcut we see from his p
a pile of broken bodies bloody debris and a dead dog with a mop sticking out the top
flashcut the man steps outside and motions rocco in
roccos face is now expressionless as the two load the last body in the furnace and toss the dog in unloading from roccos trunk
they shut the furnace door and there is just the low hum of a furnace and the light wind blowing
i have a poker game at the house every saturday with a couple of guys you know
why dont you come down
wife makes a hell of a bar g que
yeah id like that
tell me something
what did they do
i dont know
rocco is looking down in silence
worst day of my life man
pause well im sold
dont worry roc
well do this guy right and youll feel a lot better
the three burst in all yelling at each other
they are all bleeding profusely from gun shot wounds
connor turns on the gas stove and slams a new clothing iron down on the burner
he has wrapped the cord around the handle so it wont burn
they have all ripped their clothes haphazardly and have made tourniquets to nurse their wounds
who the fuck was he rocco
i know you fuckin know
i told you i never saw him before
well he sure as fuck knew you
fuck you both
ya ask me he was aiming at you
the scene fades into total silence as they viciously argue
they then take turns hold each other down as they cauterize their wounds with the hot iron
two guys will hold a third down and force a wadded up pillow case in his mouth as they burn him smecker sits on the balls of his fee on
a sprawling front lawn
he looks out to the street and sees a forensics technician kneeling before a new gray ford taurus riddled with bullet holes
the man marks a sea of different sized bullet casings that stretch for thirty five feet down the sidewalk
he circles two blood stains on the side walk with orange chalk
smecker turns and looks at the front of the house
it is peppered with bullet holes all seemingly concentrated on the front stoop area
men try to lift blood samples off the white paint around the door
he stands and dolly duffy and greenly are ready with pens and notebooks behind him
heres what happened
connor murphy and rocco sit in a parked van down the street from the beaver cleaver house
the three are sitting next to each other in the longer back seat
they have a counter in front of them with all their guns and accessories on it
the clicking of bullets into clips and smacking of clips into guns are heard
smecker sits in the captains chair directly across from them calmly smoking a cigarette
they finish their preparation
rocco holds up his guns
they waited in a parked car down the street for the kid to leave
murphy spies a young boy peddling his bike out of the driveway
he goes to the front of the van
there he goes
turns back to them pulls his guns okay gentlemen
are we ready to bring this man into the light
are we ready to truly do the work of the lord
cocks his pistol a fuckin men
this is so fuckin cool
connor murphy and rocco make a frenzied exit from the van and walk across the front lawn each carrying a black duffle bag and clutching a mask
the garage is opened a crack
they pull it up all the way
the sun shines in on smecker who stands there smoking
they enter and close the door behind them they went in through the garage
the kid says he leaves it open when he takes his bike out
they dive into their bags and suit up with leather gloves masks navy p coats and their guns
the three open the door and enter the house and walk deliberately down the hallway
now they know the wife is the gate keeper
she knows the code
they walk with the terrified woman around the pool to a steel door pool house entrance
there is a number pad next to the door
rocco positions her in front of it
dont fuck with me lady
ill kill you
she slowly punches in the numbers
smecker is standing there smoking
the wife says she doesnt know what happened after she hit the code
she just remembers going down
but judging by the burn mark on her back i think what they did
rocco pulls a stun gun and zaps her with it
she goes down
was use a stun gun on her
connor reaches for the knob but rocco stops him
they wait guns drawn and focus on the door knob
now the guy knows a friend is coming to the game
and they know that this door can only be opened from the inside
so they wait
and when that door opens man
the knob turns and they kick it in
they burst in and line up shoulder to shoulder guns aimed
smecker stands beside rocco with his thumb and forefinger extended to mimic guns
five mafiosos sit around a poker table in front of time
two men are playing pool to their left
rocco quickly scans the room
all of them
they begin firing
men are dying their chests exploding
smecker moves his hands like firing guns and yells over the noise
nobody was ready for it
this was like shooting fish in a fuckin barrel
smecker points to the pool table as the two players dive under it
now these guys dove under the table
the trajectory on the bullets show they came from straight across
so this means one of our shooters
dropped to his knees
smecker drops to his knees in perfect synchronicity with rocco
they are side by side and leaning back
rocco fires and the men under the table skip around as they are riddled with bullets
smeckers mimicking hands follow him perfectly with each shot
the boys and rocco demask
rocco goes around to all the bodies and looks earnestly at each one as connor and murphy pick up bullet casings
he aint here
what the fuck do you mean
i mean he aint here
look again for fuck sake
i know what the fuck he looks like
something went wrong
the man they came for gets off the toilet and pulls up his pants
he is expressionless
he pulls a towel rack from the wall
the door behind rocco begins to open outward
as the door swings open rocco tries to angle a gun around to shoot the man who is opening it
but as soon as the man sees his hand bam
he comes down on it with the towel rack
rocco pulls back in pain dropping his other gun but the gun fires as the mans blow connects
the shot pierces his stomach and sends him against the wall
he holds his abdomen in pain
there is a moment of recognition between the man and rocco
rocco is terrified as the man dives on him and they begin fighting
murphy jumps to help but connor pulls him back
they both stand in front of the pool table about thirty feet from rocco
let the boy go
he is now being choked as he glares at them in disbelief
now one of these guys is a real sicko
he knew this man
he wanted him to suffer to feel every second of a painful death
as rocco is wrestling and punching on the floor
he looks up
help me you assholes
they continue to cheer hes gonna fuckin kill me
he fights harder this guy is one bad motherfucker
i dont wanna die
murphy is aching to help but connor is more steady
a man who has been shot starts to regain consciousness
connor turns his back to shoot him slo mo
murphy sees his opportunity pulls the cue ball from the table and rolls it silently across the carpet toward rocco
connor fires with his left hand and as the casing ejects from the gun he catches it in mid air and makes the sign of the cross
rocco is on his back the man is straddling him
they both have each others throats and are trying to strangle one another
when the ball is within arms reach rocco slams his hand down on it and knocks his assailant in the skull
he straddles him and begins to mercilessly beat his face in with the cue ball yelling you sick fuck
he finally stops gets up runs toward the boys and throws an exhausted punch at connor who just lays roc down on the pool table and says nicely done boy
murphy tends to roc
connor checks out the man and seems surprised
murphy takes the bloody cue ball from roccos hand and polishes it off on his jacket making sure connor cannot see
he replaces it perfectly on the table
smecker now stands in front of the table with the cue shining in the background
ive never seen wounds like these before but whatever he used on this guy it was a blunt object and they took it with them
smecker exits to the left as greenly enters from the right following smecker out
he walks by the table furiously scribbling in his notebook
connor murphy and rocco exit the room pennies in the eyes of all the corpses in the background
rocco holds two duffle bags full of poker money
greenly stops picks up the cue ball and looks at the dead man
he shakes his head and says nah
smecker stands in the middle of the front lawn
his hair is a mess
hes chain smoking
his clothes are disheveled
his eyes are psychotic
he points to the parked taurus as six men in dark suits appear in a fuzzy out of focus shot
they line up shoulder to shoulder on the sidewalk
they exited out the front door
and they had no fucking idea what they were in for
rocco connor and murphy walk toward the front door
slo mo two black leather boots slowly walk up the sidewalk and stop in front of the new gray ford taurus then turn toward the house
il duce removes a white balloon filled with a few ounces of fluid from the pocket of his black trench coat
he throws it on the walk the blood splatters
he picks up the remnants of the balloon and puts them back in his pocket and stands there waiting looking at the house
the boys come out rocco in the middle and slightly ahead of them
they look out to the walk stunned
now they are staring at six guys with guns drawn
it was a fucking ambush
our three heroes stand their jaws dropping as their point of view reveals the il duce standing alone his hands folded in front of him
suddenly he throws open his trench coat to reveal a special leather vest beneath
six guns all different are holstered on the front of it three on each side extend from just below his collar bones to his abdomen
connor and murphy dont hesitate
they each draw one of their now unsilenced guns from their shoulder holsters and aim one arm over each of roccos shoulders
the duke draws his top two weapons and aims
and this was a fucking bomb dropping in beaver cleaverville
for a few seconds this place was armageddon
there was a fire fight
they all start shooting at once
the noise is deafening
the taurus is being pierced and the front of the house is splintering as it is riddled with bullets
smecker is still in the middle hands raised to the heavens turning circles
roccos pinky finger gets shot off sending blood splattering against the house
he dives in the bushes reeling
he pulls a gun and starts firing
murphy catches a bullet in the arm and dives for the bushes as well
il duce with lightening speed drops the guns and pulls the next two down as he walks to his right about ten feet
he commences firing and the casings hit the sidewalk all different calibers and sizes are dropping down the walk
its him and connor and nobody is backing down
they both grind their teeth as they fire rapidly at each other
at the same moment the duke gets hit in the arm and connor takes a bullet in the leg
the firing ceases for a moment
connor remains steady and il duce looks down at his arm and his own blood splattered on the sidewalk
he drops the guns and pulls the last two as he moves to the right
he fires with wrath as he screams the word no over and over
rocco and murphy return fire from the bushes yelling and swearing as connor does the same from his position on the stoop
the duke turns and runs leaving a sea of casings and guns that extend for feet down the walk
there are also two blood stains
in a frenzy the boys and rocco get up and withdraw some spray bottles from their bags
the begin spraying all their own blood stains on the stoop and the front of the white house
they then pick up their things and run off
smecker comes back to reality and lights a cigarette in front of dolly duffy and greenly
what if it was just one guy with six guns
why dont you let me do the thinking huh genius
he turns to the forensics guys at the front of the house and begins to walk over to him
what is taking so long with those blood samples
i cant get a good sample
there is variable here im not seeing
smecker puts his finger through a big blood stain on the door and smells it
in shock and rage they used ammonia
none of this shit is any good
you know what this means
even if we get suspects in this case we got nothing
he starts kicking the bushes and trying to tear them with his hands as he rages
the police and forensics all back off
screaming who the fuck are they
ive never seen any fucking thing like this in my whole fucking life
who the fuck are they
he backs against the building and slides down to a sitting position in the bushes as if he has given up
he raises his head and there he sees roccos pinky finger lying undiscovered in the bushes
he pulls a small plastic bag from his pocket and scoops it up
he shoves it back into his pocket and races off
rocco connor and murphy are sitting around the table
they are numb with pain and silently sipping beers
suddenly smecker comes on the news making an announcement that he is heading up the investigation to find the three of them
rocco shuts it off
points to tv what that guy
thats the guy that got us off the hook with the checkov thing
and he is one smart man
they got nothing
this guy is very sharp
if he hasnt figured us out yet he will
you bet your ass he will
well id say that makes him a lia fuckin bility
the boys look at each other
he isnt to be touched
hes a good man
looking at the bloody mess my moms gonna kill me
smecker is sitting at a computer terminal
he has just hooked into the f
s computer network with his authorization code
he is disgusted as he puts on surgical gloves and finger prints the severed finger onto a scanner
he waits for a moment
roccos face and rap sheet come up on his screen
he is in disbelief
this is all wrong
david della rocco
rocco on the steps of the police station when rocco brought the boys their clothes
he picks up the phone
boston police department
maria this is smecker
could you find me the visitors list for the day the macmanus brothers were in and read me all the names
she reads a few names then hits david della rocco
okay thank you
he hangs us puts in a smoke and knocks his head back in deep thought
smecker is drinking like a fiend
he is disturbed and rowdy
hes a bad drunk
he downs a shot and motions for another one
the bartender comes over
youve had quite a bit paul
are you sure you
pour the drink faggot ass
a good looking gay man comes up and whispers in smeckers ear and points to the back room
but i dont cuddle
they proceed to the back
smecker is stumbling
rocco pulls vincenzos car to the curb and the macmanus exit
we gotta talk about this early morning church shit
we have to go now
giggles were on the lamb
smecker staggers out of the bar
he is an absolute wreck
rocco exits a package store just down the street
he is opening a new pack of cigarettes
he is surprised when he sees smecker at the other end of the block
he follows the stumbling agent fumbling for his gun
paul sees a church and reflects for a moment before crossing the street and going in rocco a safe distance behind
connor and murphy are at prayer in the back of the church
it is mostly empty because of the early hour
connor looks up and sees smecker and rocco way up in the front
his eyes are ablaze
he is up and walking and does not bother murphy who remains penitent
there are two confessional booths with a priest booth in the middle
smecker goes in the booth on the far left
rocco tries the door its locked
a middle aged priest slips a key in the priests booth and opens the door
rocco shoves him in and goes in behind him
connor has quickened his pace
he tries both doors
he goes into the confessional on the right
rocco puts his gun to the priests head
you gonna do what i say got it
im sorry youre gonna hafta see this
dont look at me
im sorry im sorry
i didnt see
shut the fuck up
connor is furiously working his fingers through the lattice work to open the slider to the priests booth from his side
rocco takes the priest and puts his face in front of the slider to smeckers booth gun to the back of his head
dont do this my son
have you no fear of god
thats who im doing this for now open the fuckin thing
connor gets the slider open
roccos long hair hangs just inches from connors face
connor puts his thumb and forefinger through desperately reaching for a lock of roccos hair
rocco jostles the priest and puts the gun hard to his head
father ill do you right here
slowly obey whispering god have mercy on my soul
rocco starts to move the priest aside and put his gun to smeckers now open slider
just then connor snags a piece of roccos hair and pulls him back hard and fast by it until his head slams into the lattice work
rocco grabs the priest back into position
connor grabs a nice wad of roccos hair with his left hand so that the side of roccos face is now pressed to the lattice
connor then puts a gun to roccos head
hard whisper you little fuck
let him go
ill drop you right here
okay just calm down
he could hurt us brother
he could ruin the whole thing
let him go or i will deliver you right now
pulls hammer back you wont do it connor you wont
you love me man
smecker wakes up from a drunken stupor
he looks through the slider window at the barely discernible face of the now crying priest
slurred loud hello
y yes my son
whispers do your thing father
dont fuck this up
whispering to rocco what do you want me to say
just be natural goddamit
how long since your last confession my son
oh christ uh ive never confessed
the priest can hear connor and rocco whisper but smecker cannot
according to the dogma of the catholic church i should probably burst into flames right here in this booth
but ive come here for advice not salvation
connor and rocco stop and listen now
why have you come to a church for council if youre not religious
ponderous why have i come to a church
i never have before
i guess i just
felt i should
what is it my son
i put evil men behind bars but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these
cocksuckers to slip through
ive found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist
as if they have gods permission
but what they do is wrong and i should arrest them
rocco shakes the priest
but in this day and age i believe what they do is
i feel it is
a soul is what gives you feelings
happiness guilt right or wrong
it is a conduit through which the lord speaks to us
you felt that your answers would be here in the house of god today
you feel these men are necessary
the lord has spoken to you twice this day
rocco and connor show their individual looks of surprise
sarcastically has he now
you have entered the house of the lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings
is it so much to believe that god has brought you here
i guess not
it is easy to be sarcastic about religion
it is harder to take small hints from god your feelings and listen to them
to take a stand
the look of surprise on rocco and connors faces show that the priest is doing a hell of a job
those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision
i want to stand for what i believe in father
then you must find out what your beliefs are
i believe these young men are right
you know them personally
do you think they would harm an innocent man for any reason
they would never do that
the priest starts to show signs of anger as he starts turning to rocco
well the two irish guys wouldnt
but the italian guy he might
hes kind of an idiot
fear returns to the priests face
rocco presses the gun hard to the priests head and jostles him
whispers to priest goddam right i am
im beginning to see
ive been doing my job
well for fifteen years and its just not enough
all the things i wish i could do these guys are doing
millions of dollars in tax payers money wasted on shit like wire taps and surveillance
theses boys go in and take care of it for the price of a bullet
looks up ww what do you think i should do
because im a law man
rocco jostles the priest again
the laws of god are higher than the laws of man
the clouds have lifted yes
i was thinking that too
i was feeling it
all i needed was to hear you say it
ill help them
whispers forgive me father
thank you father thank you
he attempts the sign of the cross but screws it up whatever
smecker exits and they all let go after a brief pause
rocco turns and starts fixing up the priests ruffled suit
i wouldnt have uh killed you father
signs cross dominus ominus
remember youre bound
you cant talk about this
rocco exits the booth and shuts the door behind him
connor is standing outside hands on his hips
rocco smiles at him as connor fumes
giggling the lord works in mysterious ways
connor slaps him in the back of the head and kicks him in the ass
roccos still giggling as they exit
thats all you can give me
we shoot alternating coverage between the two locations
well the light caught the side of his face for a second
and it looked like he had a gray beard maybe
late fifties early sixties
so youre telling me it was one guy with six guns
a and he was a senior fucking citizen
i think its better if we find this man before he finds us again
ill see what i can do
how do i get in touch with you
were going to hit poppa joe tonight right in the comfort of his own home
then we move on to new york
its getting a bit hot for us here
ill call you tonight afterwards
hangs up smecker stands beside augustus just the way yakavetta did
i dont know who he is
smecker tosses an envelope of cash in his plate just as yakavetta did
what did he bring him in for
needed an outsider
the package boy knows everyone
hed spot our hitters a mile away
just for him
well hes the one shooting up all his guys right
hes scared of the kid
says hes real good got every available gun in the city up there
up his house
i dont know whats going on but i know its gotta have something to do with this kid
runs out there are several bodies in the hall some with pennies in their eyes some without
down the dark basement halls there is more gore
the boys and rocco can be heard screaming from a room in the basement
yakavettas voice is heard yelling and in command
connor murphy and rocco are all hand cuffed to chairs in the seated position
their clothes are ripped and they have been beaten severely
blood covers them
rocco has been uncuffed and two men hold his open hand up as yakavetta puts a pistol at the base of his remaining pinky finger
several other hold him down as he and the boys scream in tough protest
yelling you gonna tell me whats going on here
you little fuck
gimme some answers
they all yell for him to fuck off
although rocco is terrified he is holding out
yakavetta fires and roccos finger is gone
the blood splatters on connors face
rocco screams in pain saying fuck you through his sobs
after re cuffing rocco yakavetta and his goons exit
yakavetta is in the hall with four men
wears sunglasses even in the dark trying to look cool
is slick and good looking
another mafioso cohort is with them as well
what do you guys think
no way theyre gonna talk
i know rocco
he aint smart enough for this shit
these other guys are the brains
hes just a player
theres only one way to get them to talk
he walks back into the room
he saunters up to rocco very nonchalantly and shoots him in the chest
his chair is blown back to the floor
the boys are screaming and crying as yakavetta walks out
struggles to talk you guys
crying were here brother
you gotta keep going
sobbing well keep going roc
youll make it outta here
you cant ever stop not ever
as rocco dies they fall into prayer
yakavetta lights up a cigar and talks to his men
once you set him in motion you cant call him off
he thinks its still on
yakavetta stops as if terrified with a thought
oh jesus christ
hey i dont have my name spray painted on the front of this house
there are no big pictures of me anywhere
if this guy thinks the job is still a go then i got green money says the mother fuckers out in the bushes already
im fucking gone
im leaving you guys to deal with this
the four guys are left alone
they all look far from confident except for geno
one fucking guy so what
why dont you take the front
points you guys cover those other exits and if you see him dont flag him down just kill the mother fucker
im going back down to work on these pricks
murphy has scootched his chair in front of connors
he has his back to connor
he stretches his neck over and bites at the collar of his p coat
he gathers as much of the material in his mouth as he can
he starts to yell do it
but it is muffled
connor still sobbing begins to kick his brothers left hand repeatedly
he turns it into a bloody piece of broken meat as murphy screams through the shirt
finally it is broken enough and murphy pulls it through the cuff
he stands and breaks the chair into pieces and grabs the sharpest piece
hojo enters and murphy shoves the sharp stick up through the bottom of his chin into his head
he drags him around the room yelling mumbo jumbo into his face as connor jumps up and down in his chair in rage wanting a piece of the action
murphy throws the man down and connor proceeds to viciously kick his dead body
the two have turned into barbarians
murphy removes the mans two guns shiny nickel plated s
there is a knock at the door
geno jumps with fright and then looks out the peep hole
he sees a well formed pair of womans breasts in a cheap dress
he opens the door
a stunning blonde stands before him
she looks like a hooker
she wears a short hot pink dress and a white scarf around her neck as well as six inch platform heels
joey bevo sent me over
the woman speaks and it is apparent that this is actually smecker in drag
tonight aint the night for this shit
beat bevos so great
always sending us hot girls
you look like you could use a quickie
smecker kisses him full on the lips and rubs up against him
geno is convinced
he brings her inside
chappy emerges way down the hall what the fuck
i aint been laid in a week
take five minutes
if i die cause youre getting a piece of ass ill come back and beat you to death with a big rubber dick
dont worry about it
he takes smecker into a small bathroom adjoining the foyer
they are instantly in the throws of passion
they grope each other and smecker cleverly avoids any contact with his crotch
smecker lies down on the floor and starts to wiggle and seductively touch himself
geno stands over him straddling smeckers hips as he undoes his pants
suddenly smecker grabs both of genos ankles and has him locked in position
he repeatedly kicks geno in the balls from his lying position on the floor
the guy falls on his back unconscious
smecker uses a silencer shoots him in the head
he starts to whisper its on now
its on now
as he walks down the hall striding in his high heels wig back in place
he thoughtlessly blows chappy away as he passes his position and runs down a long hallway
he turns a corner and points his gun at the mafioso cohort but pauses
he is already sitting with his throat cut
smecker looks puzzled as il duce withdraws from the shadows behind him
the duke pistol whips smecker
connor and murphy are on their knees in front of rocco whom they have sat back up in the chair
they are gently placing pennies in his eye and sobbing as they begin to recite the prayer
as they speak il duce watches
he then begins to whisper the prayer right along with them
their words match up perfectly
he leans against the wall holsters his guns and withdraws a cigarette
he rolls it along his tongue and twists it into his lips
the boys are still reciting as he strikes a match
they react instantly
still kneeling they each point a nickel plated toward the duke
they turn in time to see the light from the match illuminate his face
il duce pauses then he strides into the room and proceeds to recite the last half of the prayer
he stops between the kneeling boys and finishes off the prayer
the boys are stunned as they realize this is their father
he makes the sign of the cross over rocco
then he looks down to the upturned faces of his sons
he places a hand on each of their cheeks
both sleeping boys throw their arms out mimicking a crucified christ
their father turns sees this turns back
the boys wake with a start
connor looks to his father who is already staring at him
how far are we going with this da
the questions is not how far
the question is do you possess the constitution the depth of faith to go as far as is needed
smecker opens the door from the inside and lets the macmanus father and sons in
he walks one way they walk the other through the grand courthouse halls
the media with their cameras and notebooks are at the back of the courtroom
yakavetta is testifying on the stand
he is cocky
the judge warns yakavetta that he will have no more of this behavior in his courtroom
whispering to look at his charisma
hes the next john gotti
even with all this evidence
points to the left and right sections of courtroom seating all yakavettas people are on the right
all the families of the men he has killed are on the left
everyone wants some justice
look at him
he doesnt have a care in the world
hes gonna walk
the macmanusus stand in the foyer
there are a pair of doors that go to the outside hallway and a pair that go to the inside courtroom
there is an armed guard directly inside the courtroom in front of the doors
the door opens a crack and connor waves the guard into the foyer and starts talking to him
then dad zaps him with a stun gun
the guard is on the floor incapacitated and drooling as the boys handcuff him
connor pulls out a length of chain and drapes it through the door handles that lead from the hall into the foyer
he locks them in with a padlock
how long do these put a man down for
the father zaps the incapacitated man a second time as he lay
twenty is a bit better
they suit up connor and murphy in their usual masks and gloves dad is already in his usual dark hat and glasses
the boys start for the courtroom door but dad gently holds them back
he takes a moment then slowly removes his hat and glasses
his sons look at one another and then remove their masks
the three look into each others eyes for a moment
due to the lack of hard evidence
the three burst in guns drawn and are walking down the aisle
all media to the back
drop the cameras
terrified they all obey
connor and murphy pull yakavetta from the witness booth by his hair and place him on his knees just before the judges bench
they face him toward the occupants of the courtroom
the father walks up and motions for the judge who is now banging his gavel and shouting in protest to come off the stand
as soon as he is within arms reach dad takes him by the collar and drags him down the aisle all the way to where the media stands in horror
he turns and walks back down the aisle
loudly you people have been chosen to reveal our existence to the world
you will witness what happens here today and you will tell of it afterwards
all eyes to the front
looking to his comrades fuckin do something
the father keeps them covered
he passes the front he looks and sees a virginal looking woman with her head down crying into her hands
she is on the left side
he gently tilts her chin forward her eyes fixated on a faded blue butterfly on the back of his hand
whispers you must watch dear
itll all be over soon
she obeys the father takes out a flask
he pours the booze on the judges bench and set it ablaze
fire alarms start to sound
connor and murphy jump up on the lawyers tables
murphy on the prosecution side connor on the defense
the father has his sawed off to the back of yakavettas head
yelling over the alarm now you will receive us
yelling over the alarm we do not ask for your poor or your hungry
we do not want your tired and sick
it is your corrupt we claim
it is your evil who will be sought by us
with every breath we shall hunt them down
each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies
do not kill do not rape do not steal
these are principles which every man of every faith can embrace
these are not polite suggestions
they are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost
points to yakavetta there are varying degrees of evil
we urge you lesser forms of filth pointing to yakavettas people not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption
into our domain
for if you do there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three
and on that day you will reap it
and we will send you to whatever god you wish
connor and murphy jump off the table
they approach yakavetta and stand on either side of their father
all three men hold guns to his head and recite the prayer
as they speak the right side of the courtroom screams in protest
the left watches in wide eyed terror although some men encourage them to do it
the macmanus read the prayer
they do not falter as the flames rage behind them
yakavetta accepting his fate closing his eyes
peacefully he does the sign of the cross
the all fire at once
the room explodes in confusion
the three exit the back
the macmanuses are all shackled and in blue jumpsuits of the boston lock up facility with bags over their heads
duffy is in full uniform with a shotgun behind them
smecker is leading the prisoners down the hall
he flashes his f
identification to every cop he encounters
the media is in a frenzy
little bits of the story are known
the people from the left and right sides of the courtroom are yelling and pushing each other as cameras and microphones try to pick up the news
finally all the focus comes to the virginal woman who had been sitting in the front row
all lights cameras and microphones are on her
were you in the courtroom miss
did you see
i was there
how do you feel about what they did
slo mo she sees at the grande halls end smecker leading the three out bags still over their heads
she sees dads butterfly tattoo
i guess we all know what is right and wrong
we all know
nobody needs to be convinced of what he was
im going home now to have my first real full nights sleep
the people who had been on yakavettas side of the courtroom threaten her and force their way through the crowd toward her thus causing the two sides to fight
everyone even reporters are in it
the camera tilts up ending on the statue of the blind lady of justice
