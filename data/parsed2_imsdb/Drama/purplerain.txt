the crowd is packed onto the dance floor thick against the stage

occasionally morris glances at prince discloses by his look that he doesnt care much for his act or his music
he breaks off from the girls follows jerome to the backstage entrance where theyre joined by other members of the time jesse and jellybean among them
morris casts another glance toward prince breaks into a self satisfied grin were going to slay him
lets get crazy continues as we
the crowd has become unwieldly traffic is snarled all around
horns are blaring
cops try desperately to ward off the inevitable grid lock
vanity runs against the light moves to the head of the queue to the accompaniment of jeers and catcalls
she doesnt budge an inch knocks rapidly on the glass door catching the attention of chick a burly pound bouncer with a white beard and long flowing hair
an ex marine chicks function is obvious
he cracks the door what
i have an appointment with the manager
no you dont he doesnt see anybody
suddenly a fight breaks out at the inside money window
chick spins instantly slams the door but vanity jams her boot into the narrow space
the door crashes against her instep she winces in pain but chick doesnt notice
hes already upon the offenders heaving them against the wall
vanity streaks inside blazes up the stairway ducks behind a group of chick turns instantly the door is closed vanity gone
his eyes dart up the stairway nothing
he shrugs drags the two guys off
vanity watches as he moves away
she jumps up lunges onto the dance floor crashes into a waitress jill whose tray smashes to the floor what are you retarded or something

shes years old blonde and pretty in a cute innocent way
a daisy mae type whose emotions form so quickly she has trouble sorting them out

jill squats picks up the broken glasses do you think you can just come in here and take over
i said im sorry what do you want me to do

she walks back to jill okay so you got me back fine

i have to see the manager its important
im a real good singer and dancer
i know he could use me
do you have any experience
vanity simmers enunciates every word yeah
and she turns on her heels makes her way through the club moving into the vicinity of the stage
vanity follows her reluctantly casts a look to the band
she spots prince for the first time stops instantly
his effect on her is instantaneous
passion surges through her like a tidal wave
his hair face eyes it all conspires to make her weak
its like meeting someone for the first time but seeing so much of yourself in them that their lips eyes mouth youre certain you have touched and the desire to
be with them becomes so strong that the very act of touching will release you in a way you never thought possible
prince brines lets get crazy to a rousing blistering end
suddenly the stage is plunged into darkness
the crowd goes wild
vanity snaps out of it
jill is tugging at her arm a puzzled look on her face here fill this out ill have him call you
i dont have a phone
when will he be back
you can try tomorrow
you can count on it
vanity hands the card back to her jill reads the name address looks up puzzled vanity
as morris and the time pass prince on their way to the stage why dont you stay awhile see how its done
the band members bust up but prince ignores them then ladies and gentlemen please welcome the time
sudden applause and cries
vanity and jill turn directly into the path of prince descending the steps of the stage
vanity gasps locks eyes with him
jill seems to jump out of her skin its obvious she has a crush on him something awful hi ya prince god i liked that song its real fun
she fidgets uncontrollably vanitys card buring a hole into her hand
prince glances at the card then stares at vanity the ripeness of her look paralyzing
he tears his eyes away puts on his sunglesses looks toward the stage
morris and the time rip into a funk tune called jungle love
their stranglehold on the audience is instantaneous
morris struts across the stage like a panther playing to the audience with a relish
his eyes fastened on prince his pride umistakable
prince watches morris a moment then eyes vanity again
the heat between them is apparent
vanitys heart is pounding shes not sure what to do
she keeps her eyes on morris hoping that a solution will present itself
prince watches as jill tacks the card to a board behind the bar
sizing up the situation quickly he again glances at vanity but her eyes are fastened on morris
feeling terribly shy and thinking theres nothing he can do to divert her attention away from him he reluctantly heads for the front door
vanity finally hits upon something to say turns i really liked your song too
but hes gone
her eyes scan the room frantically catches a glimpse of him leaving
she takes a sudden step then stops paralyzed with indecision
jill regards ger coldly
morris meanwhile is beside himself
some gorgeous dark haired babe eyes wide as saucers was starlng at him from the bar
prince has left and this girl is his
he motions to jerome and they direct their act in her direction
jill gazes at vanity fidgets intensely suspicious and resentful of her
she glances up and notices morris look
she seizes upon an idea forces a friendly smile taps vanity on the shoulder hey
she points to the stage
vanity looks at morris and he goes crazy entertaining her with his own special blend of showmanship
the crowd loves it
vanity is held a moment but her thouchts are elsewhere
she finally comes to a decision pulls away cuts through the club
as she runs down the stairs cuts behind chick bursts out the door
the streets are thick with traffic
she scans them wildly nothing
suddenly prince astride his motorcycle blazes past her from the opposite direction
she starts running shouts hey wait
but prince is too far away the traffic too coneested for him to hear
he whips down the street disappears around the corner
vanity continues running then slows dejection overcoming her in waves
she looks around kids are staring at her passing jokes
embarrassed she moves to the front door but chick is there his eyes upon her cold impassionate
exhausted and slighlty tearlul she cuts across the street heads back to her apartment
prince whips down the street cuts his motor coasts up the drive
he comes to a stop against a wooden gate
his house is a nondescript one family structure with a wide front porch
he lives in a neat and tidy homogeneous lower middle class neighborhood whose occupants are hard working type fiercely protective of their privacy
he climbs the steps to the porch opens the front door
his mothers scream is like ice in his veins
fear trickles into the hollows of his body like cold water his pain commands him to move but the impulse short circuits somewhere at the waist leaving his legs twitching
then another scream from his mother and his fathers voice now loud and furious listen to me
you come home when i say come home
youve got no business in the streets
his mother screams prince bursts into the room
princes living room night princes mother is at the far side of the living room crying uncontrollable
shes in her early s a dark haired faded beauty with large wild anxious eyes
theres a detectable scent of liquor in the air and her slurred speech pins her as the source
his father is in his late s a squat but solidly built black man with a cherubic face and graceful expressive hands
hes upon her now whacking
at her horribly trying to get to her face you do what i say do you hear me
youve got to keep this place clean
you here no place else
the father lunges whacks
her across the face
she topples to the floor a lamp crashes to the ground
prince cuts through the room lunges desperately in front of him pleading please dad
shes heard you
shes had enough
his mother drags herself up along the wall hysterical hes trying to kill me
look what hes doing to me
tearfully dad please
princes head snaps back his feet lift from the floor his body crashes in a heap by the door
prince flat on his back fights vertigo with everything hes got
his mother lets out a yelp rushes into the bedroom slams the door
his father stands motionless sullen get up
you aint hurt
prince opens his mouth blood gushes from a gash in his tongue
he hoists himself up slowly using the wall for support
he moves into the kitchen disappears down the basement steps
a naked light bulb snaps on
it dangles like a pendulum casting strange shadows
the basement is partitioned off into a series of rooms interconnected by a labyrinthine coimbination of passages
an old washer and dryer stand in the corner
prince descends the steps slowly
he comes through a door closes it behind him
he moves down a narrow passageway enters a small cramped bedroom
he closes the door and locks it behind him
moonlight filters in throuch the cacement windows
the total effect is like entering a womb a deep dark chamber of security and safety
lying heavily onto his bed he sighs long and deep his eyes piercing the darkness
music wafts through the sun drenched club
jill is seated at the piano a la marlene dietrich singing to her hearts content
a cigarette dangles from her lip a police cap is perched jauntily on her head
its a simple bar tune delivered slightly off key but with an openness that is endearing
chick is working in the corner chuckling to himself stacking chairs sweeping up
suddenly she stops listens intently
she jumps up deliberately spills her orange juice on the piano
prince comes around the corner stops short surprised what are you doing here
shes a bundle of loose embarrassing ends the cigarette hat juice what
what are you doing here
he feels caught out scans the board earnestly for vanitys info tries to think of something to say huh

she rumages through her bag pulls out a cassette its a song lisa and wendy wrote

well i liked it and wanted to listen to it
they told me to give it to you when i was done
he puts his sunglasses on hesitates then takes it from her gingerly
he regards it for a long time you really liked it huh
music throbs throuch the crammed rundown rehearsal hall
hardwood floors a wall of mirrors and a bank of windows provides the setting
sunlight streams through tattered yellow shades
the time is set up on one side providing the music for sex shooter a saucy number with an irresistible beat
morris with jerome by his side stands in the middle of the floor shouts instructions to
brenda and susan gamely trying some intricate dance steps
brenda is years old blond sexy with an alluring new wave look
susan is years old with dark lustrous hair and a sexy baby doll quality

morris glares at her we tried that
the girls fidget now youre in the best possible position you can be in so what s the matter your shoes on too tight or something

he flings her into the dumpster slams the lid with a crash
morris pats his brow lo rd

the shoeshine boy looks up slowly regards them with a soulfull look either of you do heavy drugs
the sidewalks are alive with bustling shoppers
vanity walks aimlessly past store windows staring longingly at the expensive items
as she stops suddenly and stares transfixed
a young woman startingly similiar to her in looks and coloring tries on a beautiful bridal gown as a seamstress adjusts the hem
the entire scene is warm and endearing
vanity is struck by lts beauty and seems to sigh
the young woman looks up suddenly catches vanitys gaze and gives her an affectionate smile
vanity smiles back avidly then give me that
she looks up startled there

she hesitates then hands it to him
he drops it into his pocket walks away hey wait

he moves away briskly vanity stands her ground amused so you gave it to me its not yours anymore
he stops short something has caught his eye
shes curious comes up behind him then you see something you like
he puts on his sunglasses
a guitar stands prominently in the window
lets go for a ride
he flips her the gold chain turns hastily
she weighs it in her hand studies the guitar its pretty
prince and vanity on his motorcycle blazing down the highway twisting through traffic
the city is behind them receding into the distance
countryside dusk they pull off an access road drop down a small embankment ride down a narrow dirt road
the pull to a stop
a lake stretches before them
vanity gets off the bike walks around exploring casting curious glances at prince
he stands by the water idly tossing stones my psychic told rne i was going to be famous
how much did that cost you
it was a good investment
he doesnt respond she suddenly feels shy no seriously my psychic did tell me
i was in a play once
oh yeah what did you play
she stretches her arms like a butterfly does a little step that means i can sing and dance
a beat want to help me
surprised pardon me
shes perplexed want to know why
a beat because you wouldnt pass the initiation
well for starters ycu have to purify yourself in the waters of lake minnetonka
you have to purify yourself in lake minnetonka
her brow furrows she looks out across the lake
hes calmly throwing stones
recognizing a challenge when she sees one she formulates a plan faces him seductively shoots him an open look
he stops suddenly locks eyes with her feels his knees go weak
her hold on him is unmistakable
she pulls off her blouse in one fluid motion tugs off her boots drops her pants to the ground
shes exquisite takes a step toward him
passion rings in his veins
suddenly she turns on her heels moves purposefully toward the water
hes shocked realizes that shes about to go in hey wait a minute
thats but she silences him savagely we made a deal
and before he can react she scampers along a log dives beneath the surface
he cant believe it her spirit really impresses him
she breaks the surface coughing and sputtering hops and jumps to the shore hold it
that aint lake minnetonka
he tries to keep a straight face jumps on his motorcvcle starts it up
his words take a moment to sink in then enraged you bastard
i dont believe it
how could you do that to me
she gathers up her clothes tries desperately to put them on
she slips and falls prince cant help laughing damn you ill kill you
she starts throwing stones
he laughs blasts up the path screaming you prick

how many girls have you done this to
he blazes up the embankment sails through the air drops expertly onto the road
he fishtails to a slick stop
vanity is by the lake flailing about throwing things trying to get into her boots bastard
he laughs heartily wants to kid her rides down the road as if hes leaving
having his fun he slows turns to go back
his smile dissolves instantly
vanity is in the middleof the road flagging down a small pickup truck
she hops in slams the door
the truck peels out bears down upon him
he gesticulates his arms wildly wants to explain hey
but the truck streaks past vanitys look is cold triumphant
the club is packed
the modern aires is onstage a hi techno funk group performing their trademark a frenzied song entitled modern aire the floor is dense with kids all performing the same syncopated
prince moves through the club slowly seems to be searching someone out
his face is drawn and haggard his spirits strained
he cuts past the bar barely acknowledges jill or the other waitresses by her side kim and katy
jill looks concerned honey you still chasing after that fool
kim is years and gorgeous with dark eyes a smooth sculpted face and taut shapely legs
she is street educated and doesnt need encouraging to speak her mind
katy is also in her early s a tall alluring oriental with an attractive intelligent face im doing what im doing

she breaths a sigh of relief
jerome watches as chick escorts vanity to the upper level

im going to make you love me
is that a fact
he folds his legs dramatically his stacy adams reflecting the light just as sure as my stacy adams are shiny
just then ladies and gentlemen please welcome prince
the club erupts in cries
prince hits the stage launches into g spot a fast high spirited funk tune that gets the crowd hopping
vanity watches as prince whips the crowd into a frenzy
morris listens with a complacent grin on his face his eyes searching out various members of the time who are scattered through out the club
when he connects with one of them he makes a series of absurd faces which sends them into hysterics
for prince is playing music that the time is noted for and as far as morris is concerned performs better
not everyone in the club is dancing or paying attention and this does not escape his notice
suddenly g spot comes to a rousing end
the crowd cheers wildly
prince moves quickly to the piano and launches into electric intercourse a love ballad which as it progresses becomes a personal statement for vanity and prince himself
she listens intently her eyes fastened on him
the words have a profound effect on her and the audience
without being consciously aware of it theyre moving closer to the stage searching for their personal fix
prince surrenders himself to the music totally releasing from himself all that is hurtful releasing the sincerity and truthfulness that escapes him in his daily life
we are entering realm where life and music are inextricably bound and the impact on the performer and listener is profound
hes directing his music toward her and she receives it gratefully almost anxiously
it fills a void in her hewn by a life of meaningless promises
he searches her face with his magnificent eyes and ends the song with a heartrending cry which connects with the souls of all present
everyone is paying attention now
the stage is plunged into darkness
the crowd goes crazy
vanity applauds vigorously wipes the tears from her eyes
morris who was more affected by the performance than hed care to admit doesnt like what he sees and searches for a winning line he doesnt like girls
shes equal to the challenge i know he likes women
but morris can barely suppress a smile and settles himself comfortably into his chair for he knows what vanity has lost
at least this round well
he dont do too good with them either
she flashes him a quizzical look he simply smiles
prince and his band move through the hallway briskly past the outstretched arms of admiring fans
theres a lot of back slapping going on as the musicians bask in the glow of well wishers
prince moves past billy sparks who has an angry look on his face whats this intercourse shit
hey man dont worry about it
im warning you
but prince ignores him cuts into the dressing room then stops suddenly surprised
hes muzzle to muzzle with a cuddly dog held up lovingly by jill surprise
by the entire group
jill hesitates then kisses princes cheek compulsively
hes surprised touched hey wait till were married now
she fidgets her face blushes red
wendy is studying the dog oh my god look at this
everyone looks jill grins like the cheshire cat notice anything
it looks like you
she thrusts the dog into his arms the band laughs uproariously
jill is beaming his hair
prince gazes into the mirror and sure enough the dogs hair has been groomed to match his
he cant help smiling shit
softly i wanted to cheer you up
im hungry wheres the food
he grabs the dog a la the werewolf starts chomping on its neck
the group busts up starts fooling around
prince glances into the mirror vanity is there
he whirls around to the door nothing
a huge smile sweeps his face instead
the band continues fooling around and prince joins in with a relish
vanity leans against a brick wall hiding in the shadows
suddenly footsteps approach
prince appears gets on his motorcycle hey
he doesnt look up we have to go to your place
i want to show you something
shes embarrassed by her apartment no
no we cant
why is there someone there
why do you always think theres somebody else
he averts his eyes kick starts his bike lets go
getting on yeah but were not going to my place
he remains silent snaps the bike into gear blasts down the ally into the street
prince and vanity whip down a residential street
as he approaches his house he slows moves past it quietly
he makes a deft u turn crosses his house again seems to be listening intently
after a moment he cuts down a narrow path turns up a back alley
he rides to a wooden gate detaches a hidden lever
the wood slats rotate like a garage door prince coaxes his bike through
they ride down a narrow sidewalk cut through a garden and emerge from the back of a garage
he leans his bike against it that was a grand entrance
where am i
he silences her with a look moves quickly across the grass comes to a window
he stands on a pipe looks in his mother and father in the living room
his mother is sprawled out on the sofa obviously drunk her dress hiked along her thighs
her head rests in his fathers lap
prince hops from the pipe leans coolly against the house
vanity looks in the mother and father kissing tentatively then violently finally pulling away
the mother seems to be taunting the father coaxing him into a trap
he kisses her mouth lustily she pulls back snarling
vanitys scared tries to be cool so friends of yours
yeah the freak show
he walks off
she jumps off the pipe follows
as they emerge around the corner
prince squats by a basement window adjusts an old coal chute then slides down it hey
she hesitates a moment then slides down too
he turns on a light disappears into an adjoining room
vanity looks around amazed
she stands in a small ante chamber whose walls are covered with thicks pads and foam
colorful mobiles hang suspended from the ceilings various instruments lie about a drumset an electric guitar and a small upright piano
a stereo and cassette player
are perched on a shelf and two speakers are recessed into the walls
the entire room looks hand built the wood carefully painted or stained
she peers through the doorway into the adjoining room
blue moonlight filters in through the casement windows
various murals are painted on the walls mobiles are suspended from the ceiling
a bed sits in the middle of the floor a vanity table and mirror nearby
she stands idly a mement then moves around the antechamber
various knicknacks catch her attention
small wind up toys lie about a soldier a bear banging on a drum a tractor and car
a small music box sits on a shelf
she turns the handle a little tune fills the room
a cassette sits in the player
she snaps it shut hits the play button
a drum beat fills the room followed by a womans voice seemingly speaking in a foreign tongue
the combination is hypnotic and sensual she finds herself drawn in
suddenly prince grabs her by the waist lets out a shriek
she draws a out breath jumps if you think you scared me you didnt
he puts his index finger directly in front of her nose moves it back and forth hypnotically
she follows it earnestly with her eyes
suddenly he pulls his hand away stretches it to the ceiling like an escaping bird
they both smile lock eyes
passion rings in their veins
the womans voice begins to moan deeply pleasurably whos the lucky girl
sounds like she was having a good time
shes crying its backwards
it makes me sad when i hear it
it sorta sounds like shes laughing doesnt it
so what did you do to her
do you always treat your women like that
i dont have anybody right now
heat floods into her womb like soft fire you look pretty
she touches his chest delicately fluffs up his hair king kong
she hesitates but he reaches out tentatively touches her breast no
but their mutual desire is too strong
their lips seek one another out timidly almost deferentially
vanity sits at the foot of the bed prince stands before her
her dress is hiked along her thighs her stockings attached to garters
their hands search delicately across the contours of their bodies drawing quick breaths from their lips
they kiss one another ardently then quickly like sparrows pecking seed
she goes to remove her dress but prince stays her with a gesture moving his hands along her thighs touching delicately that spot between her legs
a low whispery moan escapes from her lips
vanity lies back drawing prince toward her
his lips move across her mouth her neck her breasts
she moans softly pulls her dress above her thighs goes to remove it
once again he stops her slowly turns her onto her stomach
on her knees her head resting on a pillow
his hands move up along the back of her thighs past the garters to her panties
he tugs at them gently then rubs his hand firmly between her legs
she moans suddenly the shudder moving through her like a whirlwind
moonlight glows throuch the casement windows
mobiles stir gently in the night breeze
prince and vanity are asleep
he rests on his side his hands gently surporting his face
she lies behind him one leg dangling off the bed one shoe discarded on the floor suddenly a distant moan
quick footsteps a door slams
vanity snaps awake
fear sweeps her like a shadow from a passing cloud
she listens intently then another door slam quick footsteps and princes mother crying in the dark o
a bottle crashes to the floor
deep silence like snow in the room
vanitys racked with fear
she sits up slowly her eyes searching out prince hes sleeping
suddenly more footsteps a door slams and the fathers cry o
something heavy crashes to the floor
vanity rises from the bed in a panic
she smoothes down her dress searches for her other shoe
she shoots another look to prince but he sleeps peacefully
casting a glance upstairs she climbs throuch the casement window disappears into the night
prince is resting on his side his eyes opened
vanity moves quickly along the side of the house trying desperately to find her wav
suddenly a hand reaches out of the darkness grabs her by the throat
she screams swings her bag desperately something crashes into the bushes damn baby hold it
wails oh god god
you broke my nose
she sees its morris shes beside herself with fear and rage you shit

morris moans dismally jerome

the cop regards them suspiciously
morris and jerome snap to attention you lock the door baby

the caddy blazes by in the night
the city lights glimmer spectacularly in the distance
morris and vanity sit in the backseat
he gazes at her ardently jerome
jerome snaps a look in the rear view morris gives him a deft nod
jerome opens the glove compartment searches through the cassette tapes
he finds the one he wants snaps it into the player
restaurant ambiance fills the car
note the restaurant ambiance will grow in volume and will be followed by exaggerated dinner music punctuated with strings and delicate cymbals
the music plays throughout this scene and morris times his words to the ebb and flow of the piece to insure the proper dramatic effect
dinner music begins cocktails before dinner
yes two pina coladas
make mine a virgin
jerome braces his knees against the wheel pours two premixed coladas into plastic glasses to morris will you be having a virgin as well
jerome stifles a laugh pours a rum miniature into morris glass
he hands them back thank you

morris hands the card to her cont not morris day
he smiles jerome pulls up in front of her motel
vanity reads the card come by any time
she gets out of the car stands on the sidewalk
morris pushes the window button nothing happens jerome
jerome leans over taps the glass the window glides down to vanity one more thing
jerome snaps the glove compartment hands morris a neatly folded camisole
morris presents it to her heres a little something for you
if you get cold when you wear it call me
he snaps his fingers jerome pulls the caddy away with a screech
vanity stands on the sidewalk a moment slightly bewildered and very amused
she watches the cadillac screech around the bend
she turns goes into the motel
prince stands in the alleyway across the street his motorcycle parked nearby
he watches as vanity cuts inside
she comes down the hallway opens her door with a key
she goes inside drops the tape and card in her bureau
unfolding the camisole she holds it against her gazes into the mirror
it looks beautiful
suddenly a knock at the door morris
another two knocks something like a confirmation
she smiles cuts to the door flings it open but prince is there
shes shocked but recovers instantly i had a feeling it was you i knew it
its amazing i could tell it was you
his face remains placid as he puts on his sunglasses howd you get home
took a cab
whered you get that
she stares at the camisole in her hands i adore camisoles
he nods dispassionately walks into the room gives the place the once over then lets ride
prince and vanity on his motorcycle whipping down the highway
the dawn light breaks over the horizon
streaking down a two lane blacktop obviously exhilarated by the velocity of their ride
the landscape becomes lush the trees a riot of autumn splendor
as prince and vanity whip up to the top of a small hill skid to a stop
he scans the area quickly gets his bearings
he pops the clutch skids off to the valley below
prince and vanity ride cautiously through a series of hiking paths then twist down a small embankment
a stream flows before them
they climb off the bike look around quietly god this is beautiful
it reminds me of where i grew up
my father used to
he waits for an answer its not forthcoming your father used to what
changes subject you must like places like this
he goes to the stream balances on several rocks moves to the other side
the stream flows between them so have you reconsidered my proposal
what we talked about last time
you cant be serious
she starts a little dance step climaxes it with spins and twirls oh come on you know you really want to
youve been waiting for this opportunity all
he cant help laughing she freezes looks at him coldly im sorry excuse me
god so why do you come around
you dont want to help me not that you have to
you dont want to sleep with me not that you have to do that either
so why am i here
he smiles walks off theres a lot of things you dont know about me
youd be surprised how many things i could do
he disappears around some trees take me home immediately
i want to go home
i cant stand this
i cant take this anymore
prince moves through the trees smiling studying nature i dont need this
i was doing alright before i met you
motherfucker you need a haircut
he comes to a tree leans against it contentedly studies the foliage
vanity paces back and forth frantically along the stream to herself i dont get this
who do you think you are
you dont care
you dont care about anything
i never wanted you to help me anyway
prince rests by the tree observes two hikers walking down the path toward him you think youre a good musician
morris is better
i never wanted to make it with you anyway
the hikers pass him startled good morning
good morning sir
and they walk down the path disappear around the bend
just then vanity is standing by his side a wildflower in her hands softly im sorry
i shouldnt have said those things
will you forgive me
he takes the flower slips it into his jacket kisses her forehead
as they ride down a leaf strewn path and pull to a stop near an old weathered dilapidated barn
it stands laarge and silent like a painting
a low thunder rolls across the land
dawn light burns through the wooden slats
steam rises from the wet hay scattered throughout
the air is thick and damp
it begins to rain
vanity stands in the middle of the barn gazing at the storm
beads of perspiration glisten on her forehead
she turns slowly watches as prince retrieves old blankets from a nearby stall
their eyes search one another out their breathing becomes short expectant
she hesitates a moment then pulls off her blouse discards it to the moist dusty floor
rain patters srtongly against the barn
a deep thunder rolls
shes on top of him moving deliciously her body glowing in the purple dawn light
moist purple water shadows streak and course her skin as she moves slowly then deliberately against him
he watches her avidly his hands firmly on her thighs and thrusts into her again and again
leaves scatter as the bike whips thru the wet path
the streets glisten with the rain
prince and vanity pull up in front of her motel
she hugs him fiercely steps off the bike her face alive and fresh as a flower
his eyes sparkle see you later
cause i have to do something first
coyly a secret
okay come by eight oclock
he kicks the bike into gear she touches his jacket longingly bye
he blasts off
she watches him a moment her eyes glowing
she heads to her motel then stops short a single carnation lies oon the sidewalk
she looks around quickly almost expecting someone to claim it
but no ones around so she picks it up goes inside
she enters the lobby closes the door behind her
she turns another carnation is on the stairwell
shes intrigued glances up the stairs theres another one and yet another further up
shes confused but grabs them disappears up the stairs
as she comes to a halt outside her room picking up carnations along the way
she opens her door cuts inside
she goes into the bathroom fills the sink with water arranges the flowers within
she smiles radiantly they look beautiful
suddenly something seizes her thoughts
she opens her bureau drawer quickly pulls out the yellow pages leafs through it hurriedly we read parking passport paving
she stops runs her finger down the page then hunts quickly through her drawer
her eyes dance mischievously when she pulls out her gold chain
she places it on her bureau hurries to her clothes rack
suddenly a quick knock at the door miss v
she looks around the corner a flower delivery man stands in the hallway holding a bouquet of roses yes
surprised come in
he cuts inside and is followed by another man holding a bouquet of daisies hey wait a minute
whats going on
the men leave the room downstairs
she hurries to the window looks out morris and jerome standing by the curb their eyes fastened excitedly on her window leaning against a flower truck
we catch a glimpse of a man bringing her a dozen chrysanthemums good morning dahling
what are you doing
excited come down come down
i cant ive got things to do
cmon ten minutes
i want to show you something she shakes her head im sorry but thanks for the flowers
youre really crazy
she disappears from the window
they stand expectantly a long time
finally jerome looks at morris well
what do you think
morris is staring intently at the window he purses his lips sensualy chili sauce
just then vanity steps outside looks stunning in her tight black pants and boots
her eyes dance vivaciously a red sash is tied around her waste
morris gives jerome his sexy half lidded pouty lip look oh lord
we see prince cuts through the back entrance walks onto the floor
lisa and wendy are onstage playing a song we immediately recognize as the one they had given prince to listen to
the drum riff is provided by the linn machine a synthesized drum unit
wendy plays guitar her back to prince
lisa at the keyboards spots him and stops whats wrong
lisa points to prince
wendy immediately rips into the guitar solo of g spot
she stops suddenly is that better
do you like that
he ignores her where is everybody
youre late they left
so what are you doing here
lisa immediately launches into the opening bars of lets get crazy imitating prince but im here to tell you that theres something else our music
the girls bust up he glares at them cant you guys get off it
cant you just leave it alone
wendy meets his glare with one of her own
yeah well get off it
she turns snaps off the linn machine angrily plunging the club into silence
the time is jamming like mad deep in the heart of sex shooter
brenda and susan move furiously to the beat trying their best to get it right
they are watched by
morris vanity and jerome standing off to the side
morris has a contented look on his face even though his girls are screwing up
vanitys eyes are wide with excitement as you can see we need someone with your special qualities
prince sits on his bed staring at the clock seemingly lost in thoucht
he gets up rummages through his coat pockets pulls out lisas and wendys tape
he snaps it into the player settles back
music fills the room
he listens intently a moment his face placid
he closes his eyes tries to relax
suddenly a door slams in the far reaches of the house
harsh footsteps echo through the upstairs hallway
prince remains still his eyes closed
then another deathly door slam
glass dissolves in its frame and trickles to the floor like icicles
resentment surges in him like a tornado
he rises purposefully turns the music up
and then his door smashes open and his mother lunges into the room in a panic
she flings herself onto his bed as his father streaks in and whacks
at her with a strap screaming at her with an ominous growl of rage you aint got no business leaving here
all your sneaking around youre just a sinner
youre nothing but a low life sinner
the mother throws herself at him drunkenly starts slapping scratching at his face shut up
you dont care about me
leave me alone
prince claws desperately at his fathers back dont i keep the heat on
isnt there food in the refrigerator
crying i dont like it here
you never talk to me
im always alone
prince drags his father away dad please
shouting whats the matter with this house
isnt it nice and warm here
the mother stands on the bed shrieking youre crazy
the father lunges drags prince along the floor whacks
the mother in the face
she topples in a heap to the bed
hes over her now breathing fire flailing about savagely shut up
he lunges drop kicks his father with everything hes got
his father smashes backwards against the wall slides to his buttocks on the floor
he sits there dully exhausted
prince crawls up along the side of the bed
his mother buries her head in the pillow choking back sobs im just trapped here
his fathers eyes well with tears
he leans close to her speaks softly you always got a roof overhead
you dont let me have any fun
his father sighs wearily pulls himself to his feet
he moves to the door i could make you happy
just believe in me
i would die for you
he leaves the room closes the door behind him
prince stares at the door a moment tears welling in his eyes
his mother is motionless whimpering softly
a scent of liquor permeates the air
he moves toward her reaches out tentatively
suddenly she jumps up starts pacing franticaily its nice here

her breasts i was beautiful when your dad met me
i was out a sight
she giggles starts applying makeup i looked just like a movie star
the minute he saw me singing i knew just what he wanted
she fixes him with a conspiratorial look whispers he wanted to get into my panties
she makes funny jazzy eyes at him then stops suddenly staring
his face mouth eyes
a sudden stirring in her loins
her lips part she moistens them unconsciously
she turns from the mirror and stares at him his look connects with her groin
she rises suddenly walks slowly toward the bed sits facing him you look so pretty

she outlines the mole on his cheek with a makeup pencil then draws one on herself
she takes her earring off and puts it on his ear
they are face to face identical so pretty
she looks at him drunkenly
he tries to hold it in but cant
a tear hot and hard as a bullet flows down his cheek
she puts her index finger in front of his face moves it back and forth hypnotically
suddenly she pulls her hand away stretches it to the ceiling like an escaping bird
he swallows tries to smile she leans close secretly i have to go now see some friends
dont tell your father okay
she gets up leaves the room bye skipper
vanity climbs over a fence moves through some bushes emerges along side princes house
she has an excited ravenous look on her face
she hurries to the casement window climbs into the basement

prince puzzled cracks up watching her ass and legs dangling
she drops back into the room holding a large package
his eyes widen

hes deliriously happy and speechless howd you do it
she shouts with delight attacks him again pushing the guitar aside
fast furious kisses and he responds in kind
theyre twisted in a heap on the bed
after a moment they come up for air stare at each other playfully

matt bobby and mark are jamming onstage
prince emerges from behind the curtains
he looks drawn
and haggard his face unshaven
the guys spot him and the music trickles to a stop
tension fills the room in an instant
mark glances at his watch fixes prince with a disgusted look
prince climbs the steps to the stage cuts across it wheres lisa and wendy

theyre avidly watching
vanity susan and brenda dancing up a fierce storm
vanity fronts the two girls and moves panther like in front of the mirrors
shes a dynamo her face drawn tightly her movements crisp and precise
she urges the girls on suggests and cajoles strengthening their resolve
sweat lathers their bodies and forms rings on their danskins
the act is still very rough but the potential for success can be felt
prince suddenly enters the hall
morris spots him immediately and halts the music
the girls dance on a moment then stop perplexed
vanity catches princes look shakes her head in disbelief i want to talk to you

prince remains silent the anger coursing through his body in tremors the guys surround them grabbing princes arms legs and feet
hes like a trapped animal now lift him
crying dont hurt him
they pick him up move him toward the door
he resists them slightly his body lurching in fit and starts
suddenly he breaks free faces them with his back to he door
but the band members surround him their wills united the obviousness of the situation apparent to all
he searches for vanitys eyes but she cant face him and walks away
anger again surges in his veins
he cuts out the door slams it behind him
prince whips down a dirt access road locked in thought the pain and anger in his eyes apparent
suddenly a train whistle blasts just behind him sending a shot of fear through his guts
he twists backwards in amazement
a freight train roars around the bend blasting its horn violently
prince shudders with fright loses control of his cycle for an instant
he hits a series of ruts that almost topple him to the ground
he looks back at the train confused when another blast seems to sock him in the teeth
he twists wildly to the side of the road kicking up dirt and debris lurching him into the handlebars violently
the train roars abreast of him
prince snaps an angry look at the engineer
the guy coolly gives him the finger and blasts the horn violently
prince becomes enraged
he snaps a look to the speedometer mph
he snaps a look to the engineer the guy sends him another obscene gesture and blasts his horn
prince grits his teeth twists the throttle full
he lurches forward in an instant blazing in front of the train the engineer blasts the horn mercilessly and throws on the coals
they blast down the stretch neck to neck twist round a wide bend
prince edges in front
the engineer blasts the horn and moves up
prince snaps a look to him the guy mouths the words fuck you
prince wants to scream
he twists the throttle snaps a look to the speedometer mph
he rips past ruts and gullies like a madman
the train moves up
they blast around another bend neck to neck suddenly princes eyes widen with horror
a car is parked across the access road waiting to cross the track
he shoots a look to the engineer the guy is laughing hysterically now blasting his horn wildly mouthing the words bye bye
prince screams like a madman
he twists his throttle full
he blazes ahead of the train blasts
up the embankment sails through the air
a brick wall cuts the access road in two
he screams in bloody terror
he hits the road and fishtails wildly locking his brakes
the wall comes at him like a locomotive
hes going to hit it knows it and
he twists his throttle violently blasts
directly into the path of the train
the engineer looks on in horror
prince throws his weight forward and
the train roars past him as he fishtails wildly to a stop
the engineer sails off into the dusk his mouth agape
prince sits there breathing fiercely the adrenaline shrieking though his veins watching the train disappear into the distance
shoppers flood the sidewalks rushing for the buses that take them home
traffic clogs at the intersections while pedestrians walk against the lights
prince rides down the streets hugging the right shoulder impatient with the delays
he blasts down a side street sees flashing lights up ahead
gawkers are already crowding around
he moves through the traffic slowly glides past a police car and a small crowd
a car has run onto the sidewalk knocking down the marquee to a rundown neighborhood bar
something catches his eye he stops suddenly
his mother stands against the wall idly watching the goings on
he jumps off his bike hurriedly walks up behind her taps her on the shoulder ma
she turns he gasps out loud
her left eye is swollen shut drunkenly hi ya baby
her drunken breath washes over him his head spins ma
she rubs up against him can you give me some money
cmon just some money
she gropes for him drunkenly he suddenly realizes she doesnt know who he is here
she tugs at her wedding ring give me something for this

just then a cop moves through the crowd okay cmon now break it up
the crowd moves out
police radios cackle
three women stagger over one of them grabbing his mother cmon honey were goin in
she fixes prince with a glare youre a little young arent you
get out of here
leave her alone
prince blasts down the street sweeps into his drive and jumps off his bike practically smashing it into the gate
his eyes are burning with anger
he flies up the steps three at a time cuts across the porch bursts throuch the front door and stalks through the living room eyes blazing where the fuck are
he spins like a top streaks down the hallway throws open several doors violently where are you
he cuts into the kitchen raging answer me you fucker
he twists around frustrated exhaustion anger and pain competing for the same space
suddenly he stops listens intently a moment
we hear it now a piano
someones playing a piano
prince throws a look at the basement door its ajar
a naked light bulb snaps on
prince hesitates a moment descends the steps pauses at the door
the music wafts delicately in the night breeze
he moves down the halllway uncertainly but steadily the music growing drawing him in
he stops peers into the antechamber
his father is at the piano his back to him
hes perched on the broken stool playing with all hes got
prince moves slowly into the room his knees weakening his anger flowing from him with every step he takes
seeing his father this way he doesnt know if he should laugh or cry
he sits down silently behind him listens as his father plays
the song ends
his father sits a moment stretching his hands idly along the keys
feeling a presence in the room he spins around and jumps slightly at seeing his son
he fixes him with a threatening look then shrugs hunches over the keys is that yours
course its mine
who elses is it goin to be

theyre different too
id like to see them

no man i dont write them down dont need to

his father looks at him sullenly then looks down stares at the keys
princes eyes well with tears i saw mom up the street
she looked pretty bad

his father bites his his lip rubs a hand over his face stares at the keys
his voice comes with difficulty yeah

long pause i dont know
his father shares a hurtful look with him then stares darkly at the floor below never get married
the club is throbbing
prince is onstage stripped to the waist sweat seeping from his pores in torrents
hes deep into the pit of computer blue locked into a provocative obscene graphic with wendy
shes on her knees in front of him his crotch moving directly in front of her lips
shes made up fiercely looks like prince himself
the total effect is unnerving prince is going down on himself
billy sparks stands by the bar pretty upset
jill stands slack jawed
the kids have stopped dancing drinking they staring at the display
shaking their heads confused
the beat is savage
prince is in his own world living his own private hell
suddenly the music crescendos then winds down like a roller coaster sweeping everyone along
the beat changes radically
he turns his back to the audience and plays
and we suddenly recognize the music as his fathers the song he played on the piano the night before
but its princes now stamped with his own signature
hes bent at the waist his back to the audience alone with his fathers and his pain
the crowd fidgets
billy sparks fastens his eyes on prince angrily
kids are hanging out in front of the club
the usual queue however is noticeably absent
the yellow caddy sweeps up
jerome is at the wheel morris and vanity sit in the back
morris is dressed elegantly resplendent in a os style suit
shes beautiful in a sleek black dress with long black gloves and heels what are we doing here morris
what do you mean
i dont want to be here
i dont want to hurt anybody
its not about hurting anybody

we can use the exposure
just then brenda and susan come up to the car excitedly
brenda is dressed in a s style dress susan wears a form fitting leopard one
they both look gorgeous hi you coming in
their excitement and nervousness is endearing
vanitys heart goes out to them
she forces a smile climbs out unaided your horns are showing morris
but theyre holding up my halo
prince is on stage deep into the closing moments of computer blue
he paces back and forth frantically still locked in his own private hell
the crowds attention has wandered however and very few remain on the dance floor finding it too much trouble to keep up with the changing shifts in the music
even his band members are edgy casting quick looks to each other wishing to get on with more compelling audience pleasing sounds
as billy sparks shakes hands with morris and jerome and is introduced to vanity six for the first time
we can tell by his reaction that he likes what he sees
he kisses brenda and susan saves a special squeeze for vanity herself
he escorts the whole group to a table across the floor
vanity brings up the rear casts a quick look to prince onstage
fastens on her and brings computer blue to a rousing end
the crowd applauds but its more out of respect than eagerness
he doesnt seem to notice though or care
he confers quickly with his group
then moves center stage
the band members trade frustrated looks with each other its obvious that they have some trouble with the next song
prince presses his lips to the mike and the music starts
he begins singing darling nicky i knew a girl named nicky i guess you can say she was a sex fiend
i met her in a hotel lobby masturbating in magazines
she said howd you like to waste some time and i could not resist when i saw little nicky grind
shoots a fierce look to prince helps morris jerome and the girls to their table
vanity is watching prince a puzzled look on her face hee hee
little empty tonight huh billy
but i guess money isnt everything
jerome busts up oh no
but billy agrees the duke of dick is in rare form tonight
they all look toward the stage is fastened on vanity and its apparent to all
he launches into the next verse she took me to her castle and i could not believe my eyes
she had so many devices everything that money could buy
she said sign your name on the dotted line the lights went out and nicky started to grind
flushes with embarrassment
billy and morris notice this and glare at prince
looks dead center at them and then to vanily i woke up the next morning
nicky wasnt there
i looked all ovr all i found was a phone number on the stairs
it said thank you for a funky time call me up when evr you want to grind
stands suddenly fighting back tears
she backs from the table quickly knocks the chair over
morris tries to help her but she sweeps past him hurrying for the exit
as she comes down the stairs stumbling slightly tears streaming down her face
chick sees her reached out to help hey
but she pulls away runs out the door cuts across the street
brings the song to a blistering end
the stage is plunged into darkness
he strips off his guitar cuts from the stage ignoring the grave looks from his band members
as prince twists aggressively past a handful of fans rudely disregarding their attention
he cuts into the dressing room
hes agitated paces back and forth in a frenzy
suddenly the door flies open
billy sparks enters angrily what the fucks wrong with you prince

billy turns to go take your head out of your ass prince check it out unless you like the view up there
your music doesnt make sense to anyone but yourself
he closes the door behind him
prince stands dully a moment then sits heavily in a chair
exhaustion suddenly overwhelms him
he rests his head in his hands moments tick by
he shakes himself awake morris and jerome stand by the door that was fucked up what you did man
morris doesnt like it
and being a part of this i dont like it either
i dont care
huh its obvious you dont have what it takes to be on top
he pulls an envelope from his pocket but to show you that im sympathetic to your problems heres a pass to our show tomorrow night
then morris sticks his head into the doorway dont forget to bring a girlfriend
cars are thick in front of the taste a small nightclub located in the poorer part of the city
because of its location the taste books different dance bands four nights a week and then hosts a variety night the remaining two
aspiring comedians dancers and jugglers flock to variety night desirous of trying their material in front of a live audience and hoping to catch the discering eye of a talent
scout on the prowl
billy sparks pulls up to the curb gets out with a beautiful woman and cuts inside
jerome stands backstage fidgeting nervously staring appreciatively at the closed dressing room door
various people in costumes pass by sporadically
suddenly a burst of applause and laughter wafts into the hallway
jerome walks to the curtain and peers out billy sparks and his girlfriend being seated at a front table
a comedian is on stage juggling knives and hatchets
the crowd is roaring their approval
just then a clown passes jerome stops and hands him a flower
jerome tries to smile but his nervousness is simply too strong
the clown hands him another flower trying to elicit a favorable response
jerome is patient but attempts to ignore the clown in a polite way indicating hed rather be alone
the clown persists however going through a little routine handing him flower after flower
suddenly jerome throws them into the air grabs the clown by the throat and flings him headlong down the hallway
the clown gives jerome the finger and walks off in a huff
cuts from the dressing room closes the door behind him
he joins jerome at the curtain and they move down the back stairway to the club nervously i guess this is it
i guess so m
i think im going to be sick
why does this have to be happening to me
has it crossed your mind that were about to make the biggest mistake weve ever made
i dont think its all that bad
thats why i do all the thinking
as billy sparks spots morris waves
morris manages a weak smile offers a half hearted wave back
just then we hear a firce drum beat and ladies and gentlemen please welcome vanity six
respectful applause oh god he sits quickly followed by jerome they both put on sunglasses
a hush descends over the crowd
the curtain rises slowly
and brenda susan and vanity are frozen in a provocative vampy stance
their effect on the audience is galvanizing the crowd bursts into applause and whistles surprised what

the music is slick and fierce the girls sexy and sure

shes mesmerizing her look so alluring so profound that the audience sits slack jawed in amazement
the spotlight is hers and she soaks it in radiating a sexiness that has the audience at her feet
the entire concept dress dance music and staging is overwhelming with just the right degree of playfulness to allow the crowd easy passage into the fantasy world the girls create
brenda and susan play off her wonderfully sharing secret looks with the crowd balancing the wickedness of the act with an innocence that is enticing
theyre working strongly as a unit now the audience roaring their approval
and jerome are beside themselves with happiness
the pull off their shades immediately sit back and glow in the audiences response
stands in the back his eyes glued to vanity
her strength and sureness in front of the crowd is breathtaking
the audience loves her and he suddenly feels very alone as if another wall has gone up between them
he looks away a moment and spots
morris looking at him with a self satisfied triumphant grin on his face
prince looks away moves out of his eyesight
sex shooter comes to an end
the stage is plunged into darkness
the crowd goes wild leaps to their feet begging for more
the girls slighly over whelmed by the response and flushing deep red hold one another
tightly and take repeated bows
watches the girls bowing to thunderous applause
suddenly vanity looks at him and touches the earring shes wearing its his mothers
his knees weaken instantly and he locks eyes with her
the heat between them is unmistakable
she smiles vividly gives him an endearing wave and steps back as the curtain closes
hes moving through the crowd before he knows it trying to get to the backstage door
the crowd is thick his path momentarily blocked
he spots billy sparks cutting across the floor and congratulating morris and jerome
prince turns from them tries once again to make his way through the crowd
and the girls rush into the dressing room and jump up and down with excitement
they are beside themselves with happiness kissing and hugging one another avidly
suddenly vanity pulls away indicates she will be back and cuts out the room
as she runs down the hallway to the backstage area peers from behind the curtain scanning the club earnestly
as prince waits impatiently in the long line
billy sparks comes by spots him and stops morris is squeezing you kiddo
you better kick ass tomorrow night or else
he cuts outside disappears into the crowd
prince stands there steaming the wind knocked out of him his joy a memory
he turns back to the line but it has grown the crowd now jammed up against the door
frustrated he cuts outside
as vanity watches prince leave
a profound sadness sweeps her face
suddenly susan is by her side hugging and kissing her happily
brenda runs up pouring champagne
morris jerome and the time are at the end of the hallway and beckon her excitedly into the room
vanity forces a smile goes down the hallway casting another look at the exit door
morris and vanity stagger down the alley obviously very drunk
morris pulls from a flask
vanity is still in her lingerie wears an open coat over it
her speech is slurred did you hear these people applauding

he staggers back from the car undulates his hips wantonly whawhak
she busts up
just then a motorcycle can be heard off screen
they look around drunkenly trying to discern its direction
suddenly prince blasts around the corner full out
he streaks by morris and kicks him flat on his ass into the garbage wails oh no oh god
prince skids to a slick stop
vanity is transfixed
the entire episode took less than five seconds
he twists the throttle blasts down upon her
she breaks in a panic
she runs clumsily down another alley her coat flying
he whips after her like a madman
she flies around the corner a dead end
he fishtails to a slick stop get on
theres no way out
suddenly she lets out an excited yelp jumps on
he guns the bike bursts up the alley
morris jumps into his path drunkenly his arms extended stop
but prince blazes down upon him sending him slipping and sliding to safety
he blasts around the bend motherfucker
you long haired faggot
prince and vanity whipping down the highway
they streak down the road slow then move down a small embankment
he stops the bike and gets off
shes in a foul mood staggers around dully her head pounding her speech slurred so here we are again
so this is it huh
what do you want this time
he looks at her painfully upset about her drunken state whats your problem now

she cackles falls flat on her ass hoists herself up no big deal huh
she pulls morris flask from her jacket his eyes blacken give me that

she puts it to her lips please dont drink that

she holds the flask to her lips defiantly then goes to drink
he lashes out suddenly smashes it from her grip
she screams wildly slaps him hard across the face
he stands shocked a moment his rage surging within him smashing through every safety valve hes acquired in his life
he backhands her savagely across the jaw
she hits the ground like a rag doll
he looks at her curiously bends over her she sucker punches him with everything shes got
he screams in rage and grabs her hands as they flail about his face
he squeezes her fingers back while the tears stream down her cheeks and her mouth forms a silent ow
she bares her teeth angrily and he sucks at her mouth biting and kissing her in a fever pitch
she kicks at him violently hot tears streaming down her cheeks
he jams his leg between hers rubs it firmly against her bottom
she struggles helplessly against him as he covers her breasts her stomach her thighs with his lips
quick breaths escape from her her breathing begins to race
he snaps her panties in two pulls them from between her legs
she spreads herself as he releases his pants
she squeezes his buttocks pulls him toward her but prince resists her coldly regards her with contempt
suddenly he flips her onto her stomach forces her to stand painfully on her knees
he rubs his hand between her buttocks then thrusts into her painfully driving himself to the very depths of her
but she stifles a cry arches her back and meets his thrusts fiercely moving quicker and quicker banging her buttocks against his thighs again and again
shes drawing from him now turning the humiliation around obtaining all that she needs and desires
hes powerless her thrusts set the pace
she rises prince still inside her and tugs on him rapidly causing him to ejaculate suddenly drawing from him a sharp and sudden cry
she moves away draws her coat tightly about her fixes him with a contemptuous look youre nothing prince absolutely nothing
you think youre so special but deep down youre just like all the rest
a beat your whole life youve been hiding hiding behind your music
but now you dont even have that because last night
last night you used it to hurt someone someone who really cares
she runs up the embankment wipes away her tears faces him if you put your hands on me like that ever again ill be the last person you touch
she pulls off his mothers earring throws it at him
tears flowing she streaks into the highway blindly directly into the path of a speeding car spots her in his headlights slams on his brakes
he skids wildly across the road comes to a screeching burning stop inches from her thigh
shoots a look at prince her lips trembling her love for him written plainly on her face
but his eyes flash defiantly
she bites her lip sadly then snaps a hot look at the driver i need a ride
she cuts around the car hops in
the driver skids off into the night
prince stands there trembling watches as it disappears into the distance
prince pulls up to the wooden gate cuts the motor gets off
he walk wearily across the porch moves to the front door its wide open
he thinks nothing of it cuts into the house closes it behind him
he stands by the door motionless a curious look on his face
the stereo is on the needle skipping monotonously along the record
his mouth opens into a spasm dad
a sudden dread courses through him leaving a hollow in his stomach
his feet are like lead
he moves heavily into the room mom
panic sets in
he streaks down the hallway twists open the bedroom door its empty
blue night light glows through the windows
curtains play delicately in the breeze
hes thoughtful walks back into the living room
the coffee table is smashed
he looks at it curiously wondering stupidly if it had always been like that
then sudden bolt of fear makes his head swim
a lamp a porcelain dish some knickknacks on the mantle all smashed
he rushes into the kitchen looks around crazily daddd
nothing but the decay of his scream
the basement door is ajar
he cuts to it quickly pulls it open peers frantically into the darkness below
he snaps on the light
the scene is a riot of color and frenzy
a police car lights flashing skids into the drive
neighbors jam the streets
police cars are parked all around
the basement is packed with cops
princes father is strapped into a gurney staring dully at the ceiling
photographers snap pictures as paramedics work feverishly over him
units are pushed into his veins
an oxygen mask is placed over his nose and mouth
huge white bandages are bunched up along the back of his head
his mother is kneeling by the gurney crying hysterically grasping his hands in a white panic
two cops support her
someone is shouting instructions
radios crackle incessantly
a medic cries lift
and the gurney is hoisted up the stairs quickly the bulk of the crowd following his mother supported as she ascends the stairs
prince sits on a tattered sofa in the corner his head bowed
cops standing and kneeling beside him
somebody finished taking notes closes his pad
one cop rests a hand on his shoulder talks to him in soft tones
prince shakes his head slightly
the cop gives the group a signal and everyone disperses moves up the stairs
the cop looks at him sympathetically then closes the door behind him
sits motionless a long time
moonlight floods the basement with a foreboding light
a dog barks somewhere in the distance
he looks up suddenly his face agitated his eyes red from tears
chalk marks on the floor outlining the body of his father
theres a gun in his fathers hand clearly marked
a train whistle in the distance
hes staring at the gun
he shakes his head rubs a hand over his face vigorously and looks up again
the gun in his fathers hand
he cant get it out of his mind
the whistle is closer
he lurches to his feet paces back and forth crazily
his fathers head the gun
the whistle is louder
he throws himself into the chair buries his face deeply into his hands and cries
huge racking sobs spasm through his body
his father his mother his entire life his music his guitar
he looks up suddenly the gun in his fathers hand
and he stares at it
the whistle is louder
his heart is pounding in his ears
he squeezes them shut looks up
he bolts to his feet paces back and forth in a panic
the train is howling
a rope in the corner of the room his face the gun
he sits dully gazes at the rope as if in a trance
the train is roaring past the house its horn blasting
the rope the gun and his body dangling from the rafters in the night breeze screaming noooooo
he lurches to his feet cuts through the basement like a madman
he grabs a stick and starts slashing things crazily moving through the room swinging his stick wildly again and again
hes lost to himself now deep in the pit of an unknown terror expurgating a horror that has been festering in him for years
he flings his stick at the wall unends shelves and bureaus trampling old memories that have lain dormant for years
drawer after drawer is flung against the wall their contents smashing and scattering about
he opens a large oaken chest and flips over
thick three inch piles of yellowed paper fall out
he snaps through the rubber bands holding them together and flings the paper at the wall again and again
he stops suddenly shocked
he sees musical notes written down on the paper
his heart pounding in his chest he searches frantically through the rubble scattered about him
more and more musical notes sketched ideas simple melodies entire songs and scores all meticulously recorded on lined yellowed paper dated for the last years and signed
by his father
hes shocked to a standstill
then the full significance of whats before him hits him like a sledgehammer
he collapses in agony against the chest tears flowing down his cheeks
prince lying outstretched on the basement floor sleeping fitfully feverishly
his body is lathered in sweat the droplets glisten in the pale light
cool gray dawn
hes in a dead sleep on the floor his arms outstretched his legs twisted beneath him
his fathers outline seemingly rests by his side
just then the basement window begins to glow with sunlight
it inches slowly across the floor then sweeps him majestically bathing him in its warmth
he wakes slowly stretches his limbs like an opening flower
after a moment he sits up shades his eyes
the basement is littered with debris
the destruction is complete but in the midst of it lies his fathers music
the yellow parchment is scattered about glowing in the sunlight
something seems to flash across his mind
he stands moves quickly down the hallway to the antechamber
suddenly we hear a tape rewinding
after a moment
music and we immediately recognize it as lisas and wendys song
it plays a moment then snaps off abruptly
he stands locked in thought then sits behind the piano hunts for the first few notes of lisas and wendys song
princes father is lying on the bed sleeping peacefully
a large bandage is wrapped along the back of his head
his mother sits by his side her forehead resting on the covers her hands holding his
shes in deep sleep and its obvious at once that shes been by his side the entire time
prince steps from the shadows of the room and gazes at them fighting back the emotion that wells within him
he leans close and kisses them both gentlythen over excited lets bring them back
ladies and gentlemen the time
the crowd goes wild
morris jerome and the time return to the stage to a frenzied throng
the place is packed the crowd applauding like mad
laser lights strobe the house in a frenzy
its a glorious night and morris struts back and forth imperialistically criss crossing the stage like a lion urging the audience on
he grabs a mike you love us right
you want us right
i cant hear you
the crowd is screaming morris flashes a wide exaggerated grin what time is it
a beat whawhak
the time launches into the bird and morris laughing heartily does the bird dance with jerome as the audience roars their approval
as prince and his band sit in grave silence the exuberant sounds of the club filtering through the open door
jill is also in the room sitting on a table holding the dog silently in her lap
she casts sidelong looks to prince tears welling in her eyes
the band members fidget nervously knowing full well that their jobs are on the line and feeling awful about the personal tragedy that has befallen prince
the entire situation is very tense and its made worse every time the crowd lets out a delighted roar of approval
but prince sits placidly his face an enigma his feelings a mystery
and it couldnt be more of a contrast
the place is a riot of color and raucous carryings on
the bird is a smashing success with everyone on the dance floor trying gamely to get the steps right
morris and jerome are flushed with pride surprising even themselves with their impromptu adjustments to the act
the music crescendos then comes to a rousing blistering end
the stage is plunge into darkness
the crowd goes berserk
billy sparks shakes his head happily jesus
morris jerome and the time cut briskly past admiring fans laughing and shouting crazily ad lib its all over now
he better watch out
he doesnt even need to go on
he might as well go home
as prince jill and the band sit in dead silence listening to the times bluster off screen
suddenly the time crosses the doorway morris does a double take sticks his head into the room hows the family
the time busts up drags morris from the room
princes group is shocked casts furtive glances to him but he remains serene then over ladies and gentlemen please welcome prince
prince stands abruptly straps on his guitar
his band members look at him closely trying to discern his feelings
he gives them a cursory glance cuts out the door
prince hits the stage and the applause grows but it s nothing like the exuberance that greeted morris
he moves center stage and plants himself there his eyes staring into the audience
leans against the bar a smug look on his face
walks slowly up the stairs gazes at prince
does not move
the applause trickles away
he continues to stare in the audience making no attempt to direct his band or start a tune
a nervous twitter ripples though the crowd
those who know about the tragedy feel a profound embarrassment for him but no one turns away
then his voice comes clear and mellifluous i would like to do a song that two of my friends wrote
a murmur cuts through the crowd like a riptide
prince snaps a look to lisa and wendy and confirms that it is indeed their song
they cant believe it
tears spring to wendys eyes before she knows it
prince smiles at her then gazes at his entire band
their eyes fasten on him in an instant
he counts softly and
the opening bars of purple rain
he turns to to the audience and its a ballad a poem really a plea for understanding love and survival
its a testament a pact if you will between himself and others
the audience is mesmerized all eyes are upon him but prince doesnt notice
lips pressed against the mike dark eyes streaming hes lost to himself now loosening all thats within him cleansing himself of his rage hatred and pain
every moment she has shared with him is expressed in this song and the effect on her is unnerving
her heart leaps to him in a way she never thought possible
but she lets it go willingly as the words draw her in seducing her somehow making her free
as if the music his words all that he has experienced and understood is purging what is confused and ugly within herself leaving her with an understanding and joy that
burns in her womb like soft fire
a smile springs to her lips as tears continue to flow and she finds herself moving closer
as the audience moves closer drawn somehow to the stage to the person who sings so truly to the person who gives of himself unselfishly to all that he feels
prince begins a long sustained cry that cuts though the hearts of all present
the music builds awsomely and he continues to sing out emptying himself of all the remaining pain lying within
the music crescendos and comes to a quiet end
a silence so profound you could hear a pin drop
prince sighs assumes the worse then cuts across the stage purposefully
now some clapping
and a whistle from the back and the shouting
and more whistles and some even screaming
and the whistles and the shouts and the clapping growing and growing as
prince cuts from the stage in a frenzy rushes toward the rear exit
the applause is building and building until its a thunder an onrushing roar an avalanche of hysteria that rocks the club mightily
is still running though his face streaming with tears past the surprised look of jill past the fans past everyone stripping of his clothes fiercely flinging off his jacket his
shirt his scarf he smashes open the door bursts outside
he sucks in the night air as if he was drowning
he wipes away his tears rushes to his bike starts to undo the chain
theyre shouting his name
not randomly not haphazardly but
and relentless very demanding downright urgent and
a wry smile crosses his lips
he heads back to the door
jill is there scared her face a map of tears
he flashes her a smile hi
shes thunderstruck can barely squeak it out hi
and he whips into the hallway
her face dissolves into a smile of pure joy
moving now fast and furious
the hallway is lined with people
they reach for him as he passes touching him showering him with their love
someone hands him his shirt another his scarf its so intense
hes moving quickly now his jacket up ahead closer
he stops suddenly stunned
vanity is holding his jacket
hes struck speechless she hands it to him smiling tears streaming down her face i love you
his knees go weak she kisses him spontaneously pushes him lovingly to the stage
hes half running now like crazy his band is on stage peering anxiously into the hallway
they spot him and relief sweeps their faces like a tidal wave
he whips his jacket on rushes up the stairs
prince walks center stage
the audience goes berserk
he acknowledges wendy and lisa and then the entire band
the crowd is jumping out of their skin
he straps on his guitar gives a deft signal and music
the band launches into i would die for you
vanity squeezes her way through the crowd and stands watching prince from the wings
he presses his lips to the mike and sings
the music continues as we
prince walks through the living room slowly gazes at the smashed table the broken lamp and dishes
every item in the room suddenly takes on a profound significance
his fathers slippers under the sofa his mothers knickknacks on the table her pen and ink drawings on the wall
after a moment he picks up his fathers slippers studies them a long time
the door opens a light snaps on
he walks into the room places his fathers slippers in the closet
his mothers dress is lying in a heap on the floor
he picks it up and puts it away
as he descends the steps hesitantly
the floor is covered with rubble
he sits on the steps stares at his fathers music on the floor
i would die for you continues as we
prince on stage singing i would die for you
the audience is captivated locked into his grip again
his eyes seem to be focused on something far away
he closes them tightly presses his lips against the mike
the music continues as we
hes in the final stages of cleaning the basement floor
the debris has been swept up shelves righted smashed items thrown away
he stacks his fathers music neatly tears welling in his eyes
he places it in new boxes stands wearily a fulfilled look on his face
suddenly he stops stares at the awful chalk marks on the floor his father lying down the gun gripped in his hand
i would die for you continues as we
prince on stage singing i would die for you
hes lost to himself now locked into a personal horror he alone can see
the crowd is pressed against the stage mesmerized by his performance
billy sparks is also drawn in amazed at the power being generated from the stage
prince sweeps the audience with his eyes then fastens on vanity earnestly sings directly to her
the music continues as we
he pulls a hose from behind the washer draws it on to the floor
he hesitates a moment gazes one last time at his fathers outline tears welling in his eyes
he turns the water on watches as the dusty yellow chalk gives way reluctantly mixing with the water swirling down the drain
calmness sweeps his face like a passing cloud
just then sunlight blazes in through the casement windows
water droplets glisten brilliantly in the morning light
he turns the water off goes to put the hose back stops suddenly surprised
his mothers earring lies on the floor
hes entranced picks it up stares at it a moment
everything hes been through comes rushing at him like a loco motive
the confusion the shouting and violence the darkness that eclipsed his parents life its all there lying just below the surface settled into his heart
but now theres a difference he knows its there and has discovered what could happen when it takes control of your life
so as he stands in the basement on the clean cellar floor he realizes that
hell just take one thing at a time and do it right
better than anybody else
he smiles realizes that in the last few weeks hes never felt better than he feels right now
he turns quickly flips the earring to the stairwell
vanity plucks it from the air
their eyes lock and they share smiles of pure joy
he picks up his fathers music and they both head up the stairs
i would die for you continues as we celebration
everyone is jumping up and down
prince is radiant strutting across the stage his hands upraised
the crowd goes wild
he flashes a wide grin to vanity then twists eyeballs the crowd wickedly wonderfully
its too much
everyone is joining in now
even morris and jerome standing in the wings start dancing like crazy
then suddenly they catch themselves stop act dignified
but vanity sees them and busts up
they catch her look laugh heartily and join in again
the music segues into a fierce beat
the crowd lets out a roar
prince strips off his guitar streaks center stage
the band launches into baby im a star
and the crowd laughing dancing shouting and loving
the club is alive
and the music continues
