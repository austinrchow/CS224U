a semi high end stereo store in the valley
buck dressed in his usual cowboy digs is talking to a customer about a stereo unit
the manager a skinny white guy with a mustache and mustard suit jerry s is standing nearby
so basically youre gettin twice the base cause of the tk modification we got in this system here
i dont know do i need that much bass
if you want a system to handle what you want yes you do
see this system here
this is hi fi
what that means is that its the highest quality fidelity
its the price i have this unit at home
but ive got it modified with the tk which is a bass unit that basically kicks in another two maybe three quads when you really crank lemme put another eight
track in so you can get a better idea what im talkin about buck ejects the eight track that was playing and puts in his own of a country western song
hear that bass
it kicks and turns and curls up in your belly makes you wanna freaky deaky right
if you get this unit as it is it wont sound like this without the modification and we do that for a small price
the customer listens another moment then thank you for your time
the customer exits and jerry approaches buck
the fuck was that
have i told you
i dont alright a
you play that country western crap and no ones gonna buy a stereo
you throw on some kc and the sunshine band a guy looks a particular way and youve seen the profile sheet you throw on some led zeppelin
instead you play this twingy twangy yappy dappy music

jack floyd gondolli and the colonel sitting
so lets talk about the future
so lets talk about what video means to this industry and lets talk about how all of us not one of us but all of us will profit
ive been doing theater work in san francisco and san diego for as long as youve been doing stag and hardcore jack
i know youre history floyd
no ones doubting your history or your credentials floyd
then why the resistance
i mean this industry is going to be turned upside down soon enough then why help it
why not be prepared
the money comes from the colonel the talent comes from you jack
ive got a connection to the equipment and the mail order distribution not to mention those kids i got out there who are hot fuck action to the max
this is the future
video tape tells the truth
i have a stable of actors and actresses
theyre not a bunch of fucking amateurs
theyre proven box office and they get people in theaters where films should be seen and they know how to fuck well thats right jack and by that same token
youre the one with the power here
the video revolution is upon us and our role is critical
we have an obligation to use our resources and talent to help make it fly you come in here at my party tell me about this and that tell me
about the future tell me about video and amateurs and all that well lemme tell you something now i will not shoot films on video and no i will not loan out my actors who are under contract to me
wait a minute jack
im not a complicated man
i like cinema
in particular i like to see fucking on film
i dont want to win an oscar and i dont want to re invent the wheel i enjoy simple pleasures like butter in my ass and lollipops in my mouth
thats me call me crazy call me a pervert but this is something i enjoy
one other small thing i want to do in this life is make a dollar and a cent in this business im not trying to hurt you
im trying to help you stay one step ahead of the game were repeating ourselves now floyd
jack i think this is about cost and future the future is as bright as we make it it shouldnt be sacrificed for a few dollars that can be saved
shooting on video tape if it looks like shit and sounds like shit it probably is shit i think youre one gin past this conversation no
im crystal clear here
jack please understand that this is not an argument
this is a fact of what
this is not an argument but a what are you saying
what do you mean jack cmon are you telling me that youre working with this shit
i think that there is a serious case to be made for the price and the gamble on the whole idea of a home video market jack two three years
from now everyones gonna be able to walk into their local supermarket and buy or rent a videocassette true film fans wont watch that shit
it doesnt look good and more importantly it doesnt make sex look sexy
it doesnt have to look good jack
film is just too damn expensive
the theaters are already planning converting to video projectors
i havent heard that
weve got ten minutes until the new year and i dont want it to start like this so im leaving now
we will or we wont continue this conversation some other time
floyd looks to the colonel

end sequence d cut to black title card six months later amber is sitting in a room with a long desk a few chairs and fluorescent lights
a middle aged female judge enters and greets her hello
you must be maggie
im kathleen omalley
you have a lawyer with you
i do not
they sit in silence
the judge looks over a couple of files
moments later ambers ex husband thomas late s steps in with his lawyer
they all take seats
introductions happen etc
the judge looks over some files youve been divorced for six years
to lawyer and the agreement on the money settlement was taken care of
what were talking about then is coming to an agreement on custody of andrew
what was decided during the divorce
initially andrew went with his father and visitation was given to his mother on looks at a paper from saturday noon to sunday at seven
with his mother entitled to bring andrew to her home or any reasonable place
to amber was that the understanding
and why wasnt that visiting privilege honored
well it was for a time i only saw him twice
it said reasonable place and i didnt think a house of drugs and prostitution and pornography was that
im sorry what is it that you my ex wife is involved in the pornography business i didnt think that environment was a safe place for my son
this is not right
my son was never exposed to pornographic material or drugs or any of these things my husband just assumed i saw it with my own eye
amber has no response
the judge looks down at the file
did you register this as a complaint
my client didnt officially register but i think the circumstance called for something immediate for the safety of the child
how old is the boy now
hell be thirteen next month
where do you live now
we live in long beach
i have a job there and my new wife is home with him
pause you see the problem is judge is that my ex wife is a sick

so we call him up give him the price
half a key for like
five thousand bucks

he smiles and casually speaks i put a mix tape together of all my favorite songs

the bodyguard reaches into his coat
todd pulls his revolver quickly and aims at the bodyguard
dont reach for your gun
rahad reacts by aiming his gun at todd
you dont wanna do this friendly
youve only got one bullet
rahad pulls the trigger
a bullet fires from the gun and strikes todd in the shoulder
the gun in his hand falls to the floor and he stumbles back
the bodyguard takes this moment to grab his own gun from the holster and fire off shots at dirk and reed
bullets graze past them and they duck for cover
the girls in the bedroom scream and shout at the gunfire
a stray bullet hits the asian kid in the heart but he doesnt fall
todd reaches hold of his gun crouches for cover and fires a bullet straight into the bodyguard
who falls back dead
todd looks right and sees rahad scuttles into the bedroom with the women
todd looks over his shoulder to dirk and reed he went in the bedroom

rahad fires another shot
a blast breezes past their heads
dirk and reed make it outside
rahad chases after them

some shrubs and trees he gets lost from camera dirk gets around to the drivers side of the corvette shielded and crouched he opens the door and starts to get in dirk stumbles back from the car
he looks to the house rahad is about to fire the shotgun again
he looks down the street the corvette is rolling away and picking up speed as it goes down the hill dirk gets on his feet and makes a run for
the car rahad fires
dirk catches up with the car hops in gets the key in the ignition and starts it up peels off down the street dirk pulls around and stops a moment
