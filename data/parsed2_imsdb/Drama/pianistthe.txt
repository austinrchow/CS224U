black and white
people toing and froing
a man rattles by
wladyslav szpilman plays chopins nocturne in c sharp minor posthumous
hes twenty eight years old elegant and handsome
in the booth separated from the studio by a glass screen an engineer wearing collar and tie monitors the broadcast
behind him a window to the street with strips of paper taped on it as protection against blast
without warning a bomb drops nearby then another and another
the whole building shudders alarmingly and the window in the booth shatters
the engineer and szpilman exchange a look as a man enters the booth and talks urgently to the engineer then goes
the engineer makes a cut throat gesture but szpilman shakes his head determined to play on
he plays then glances at the booth
the engineer has gone but through the shattered window he sees fires raging
very near a loud terrifying explosion
the reverberations cause plaster to flake and dust to trickle down over his face
and then a bomb explodes even closer
the glass screen separating booth from studio implodes showering szpilman with glass
he stops frozen
people rushing in all directions many carrying files boxes papers shouting calling
some of the men in military uniform
the bombing continuous
szpilman fights his way down the stairs
he has a small cut on his forehead and is dabbing it with his handkerchief
he has a dazed look
halfway down the stairs a young woman dorota tugs at his sleeve mr
he turns to see an extremely pretty young woman gazing adoringly at him while theyre jostled and shoved
his eyes light up
i came specially to meet you today
i love your playing but what a day to choose
who are you
my names dorota im jureks sister
jurek pushes in beside them and takes her arm
cmon dorota you can write him a fan letter later this isnt the best time cmon
jurek pulling dorota fights his way down the stairs
calling jurek why have you been hiding her
and he too is carried with the flow into the lobby
szpilman fights to get to the main door when another bomb explodes filling the air with dust and debris obscuring him and everyone else
the szpilman family in panic coming and going out of rooms packing clothes and belongings into open suitcases and a trunk in a comfortable tastefully furnished bourgeois apartment the living
room lined with books paintings and boasting a boudoir grand silver platters and candlesticks
the family consist of mother in a state of great anxiety father regina twenty six halina twenty two and henryk twenty four the only one not in movement
he sits by the radio set ear to the speaker trying to tune to a station
no bombs now just the distant sound of artillery fire
father holding a silver framed photograph crosses to mother
what you think should i take uncle szymons photograph
take it dont take it take what you like
cant you see im worried sick
hell come home hell be all right
he goes into his room
she can barely control her tears and hurries into the kitchen just as the front door opens and szpilman enters looks round bemused by the activity
mama wladeks home
mother dashes out of the kitchen
thank god wladek
its a little cut nothing
ive been worried sick
i told her not to worry
you had your papers on you
if youd been hit by a bomb theyd have known where to take you
the girls suppress smiles
henryk dont say things like that god forbid god forbid
calling through a door papa wladeks home
father appears in the doorway beaming clutching a violin case
what did i tell you
looking around the room bemused what are you doing
whats it look like were doing
the toing and froing continues non stop
to henryk they bombed us were off the air
warsaws not the only radio station
pack darling get your things pack
where are we going
out of warsaw
out of warsaw
you havent heard
havent you seen the paper
wheres the paper
she starts to look
the others continue to bustle and pack
i used it for packing
exasperated she used it for packing
the governments moved to lublin
all able bodied men must leave the city go across the river and set up a new line of defence thats what it said
theres hardly anybody left in this building only women the men have gone
and what do you think youll do while youre setting up a new line of defence
wander round lugging your suitcases
pack wladek theres no time
im not going anywhere
im not going anywhere either
dont be ridiculous weve got to keep together
no no no im staying put
if im going to die i prefer to die at home
crackles whistles and static from the radio
ive got something listen
they gather round
an important announcement
news has just been received through the bbc that great britain having had no reply
static and therefore has declared war on nazi germany
a collective gasp next few hours
awaiting latest news
henryk hits the set
but france is expected to make a similar announcement
static poland is no longer alone
the polish national anthem plays
all are still
father pours liqueur into glasses
the family are seated around the dining table having just finished a meal
the table groans with the remains of the dinner
szpilman has a plaster over his cut
lighting up a cigarette mama that was a great dinner
it certainly was
when theres something to celebrate youve got to make an effort
the glasses are handed round
heres to great britain and france
they all clink glasses and drink
i told you
didnt i tell you
all will be well
a column of german soldiers led by an officer on horseback march into view
on the sidewalk of the street with its buildings in ruins smoke still rising stand onlookers including szpilman and henryk and a little behind them father craning to see
they watch expressionless as the germans march past
regina is opening and closing the window examining the frame with her fingers
halina is on a box removing and replacing books
mother sits at one end of the table polishing a mans watch and chain
at the other end father sits counting a small stack of notes and coins
henryk is deep in thought and szpilman is fiddling with his fathers violin
the apartment has less furniture now and the silver has gone
finishing the counting five thousand and three
is that all
yes five thousand and three zlotys thats all weve got left
its three thousand and three zlotys too much reading from newspaper re further restrictions regarding liquid assets jews will be allowed to keep a maximum of two thousand zlotys in
what are we supposed to do with the rest
deposit it in a bank
whod be stupid enough to deposit money in a german bank
we could hide the money here in the window frame
no no no
ill tell you what well do
well use tried and tested methods
you know what we did in the last war
we made a hole in the table leg and we hid the money in there
and suppose they take the table away
what dyou mean take the table away
the germans go into jewish homes and they just take what they want furniture valuables anything
what would they want with a table
all look at the table its covered in stains and the veneer is coming away at one end
a table like this
he pokes his finger under the veneer
it snaps revealing bare wood beneath
what on earth are you doing
theres a good place under the cupboard
listen ive been thinking that makes a change
you know what we do
we use psychology
we use what
we leave the money and the watch on the table
and we cover it like this
covers it with the newspaper in full view
the germans will search high and low i promise you theyll never notice it
of course theyll notice it
but look lifts the violin fingerboard
this is a good place for something
a good place for what
to the others hes insane
just shut up
overlapping my violin
they all talk at once
order please order
shes a lawyer she likes order
listen just listen
lets come to an agreement
we jam the money in the window frame
the watch we hide under the cupboard
and the chain we put in the violin
a brief silence
will i still be able to play
lets find out
they start to hide the things
szpilman is on the public telephone waiting for someone to answer his call
how are you
fine were fine thank you and you
filtered fine were fine in the circumstances
but i can guess what youve called about
theres nothing we can do they wont reopen the station trying to interrupt yes i know but jurek jurek
filtered not even music nothing no radios for the poles
but im sure youll find work wladek a pianist like you
maybe maybe not but jurek dont be offended i didnt call to discuss my future career
szpilman and dorota stroll along a tree lined street with bombed out buildings and rubble
she flicks admiring almost loving glances at him as they walk and talk
and he is smiling touched by her
i nagged jurek for weeks and weeks
and at last he gave in and said all right come with me tomorrow and so i came and they bombed the station
you know something
meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful
he looks at her smiles it was
it was unforgettable
ive always loved your playing mr
no one plays chopin like you
she begins to laugh
i could accompany you me on the piano you on the cello
they become almost helpless holding on to each other
oh mr szpilman youre quite
amidst their laughter he takes her hand and kisses it
the family are gathered around the table listening to father reading from the newspaper
the apartment has even less furniture now
the paintings are gone
reading re emblems for jews in the warsaw district
i hereby order that all jews in the warsaw district will wear visible emblems when out of doors
this decree will come into force on the st december and applies to all jews over twelve years of age
the emblem will be worn on the right sleeve and will represent a blue star of david on a white background
the background must be sufficiently large for the star to measure eight centimetres from point to point
the width of the arms of the star reading must be one centimetre
jews who do not respect this decree will be severely punished
governor of warsaw district dr
then i wont wear it
wont wear it
im not going to be branded
grabbing the newspaper let me see this
doesnt it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves
where will we get them
were not going to get them
were not going to wear them
silence each locked in their own thoughts
father wearing the star of david armband walks slowly along carrying a string bag containing potatoes and carrots his eyes fixed on the pavement as if his thoughts are a
million miles away
he passes two german officers
a harsh shout you
father stops turns fearfully and approaches the germans
why didnt you bow
removing his hat im sorry i
i german officer cracks him hard across the face catching his ear
father reels collects himself as best he can and starts to shuffle on calling after him you are forbidden to walk on the pavement
walk in the gutter
father steps off the pavement and walks in the gutter
the german turn and go
father walks on
szpilman composing at the piano
he plays makes adjustments with a pencil to the manuscript plays again
the flat is almost bare
halina enters with a newspaper
have you seen this
irritated what im working what
she hands him the paper
he looks at it
his expression darkens
a map of the proposed jewish area two distinct districts one large one smaller
what is it
thats where theyre going to put us
what dyou mean put us
she looks over his shoulder and reads
as she does so the door of henryks room opens and he stands leaning in the doorway watching as if amused
by order of the governor of the warsaw district dr
fischer concerning the establishment of the jewish district in warsaw
there will be created a jewish district in which all jews living in warsaw or moving to warsaw will have to reside
and look here jews living outside of the prescribed area will have to move to the jewish district by st of october
szpilman gazes at the map horrified
they wont get all of us
its too small
theres four hundred thousand of us in warsaw
three hundred and sixty thousand so itll be easy
he laughs but theyre disturbed by a sound from another room the sound of crying
they look at each other puzzled then halina opens a door and looks in
szpilman and henryk join her
father is asleep but mother is sitting on the bed holding a purse crying
halina sits beside her puts an arm round her
mama what is it
mother opens the purse to reveal a crumpled note
thats all weve got left
what can i buy with twenty zlotys
breaking down im sick of cooking potatoes potatoes potatoes
halina tries to comfort her
szpilman and henryk watch
hands on the piano keyboard
podgy hairy hands with dirty nails
they play an octave harsh toneless with straight fingers
the hands belong to mr lipa a dealer early fifties
he sits at the piano now examining the lacquer
regina stands in the bow watching him
henryk is at the table also watching intently
szpilman sits apart aloof his back to the piano and to mr lipa
thats the price
thats what im offering
and my advice is to accept
you wont get more from anyone else
but its a steinway mr lipa
my advice is to take it
what you going to do when youre hungry
eat the piano
henryk suddenly makes a lunge for him grabs hold of him a rough struggle takes place and during it mother and father appear at their bedroom door to watch appalled
youre a thieving bastard we dont want your money get out
wed rather give it away
regina tries physically to restrain him
overlapping warding off henryk hey
whats the matter with you
havent you eaten today what you suffering from
overlapping henryk stop it leave him alone
recovering catching his breath overlapping you people are crazy
im doing you a favour two thousand and im paying for the removal im not even charging for the removal
henryk subsides glowering at him
you havent eaten today youre crazy
suddenly turning to them severe take it
a great column of jews of all ages make their way towards the area that will become the ghetto
on foot on bicycles on horse drawn platforms some pushing prams loaded with belongings
a great moving mass of humanity
theyre watched on either side of the street by poles
on a horse drawn platform the szpilmans with their belongings
all wear armbands
szpilman halina and henryk walk beside the platform with mother father and regina seated on it
szpilman catches sight of someone among the onlookers smiles and pushes through the crowd to dorota close to tears
i didnt want to come i didnt want to see all this but i couldnt stop myself
how are you doing
fine no not really they arrested my cousin but jurek says theyll let him out
stops tears in her eyes
this is disgraceful
dont worry it wont last long
thats what i said its so its too absurd
ill see you
he smiles and runs to catch up with his family
he looks back but dorota is lost to sight and the procession continues on its way
two rooms on the third floor a living room and a kitchen
the szpilmans are unpacking their belongings in silence
father pauses for a moment to take stock
to tell you the truth i thought it would be worse
how will we sleep
ill sleep with the girls in the kitchen
you henrykc and papa in here
at a window look
come and look
they all go to the window and look out
their pov the street
further along men are building a wall across the street
cold freezing day
people selling shoes clothes carpets curtains food
a woman offers cakes under a barbed wire cover
noise bustle restless wing and froing
among the traders henryk slightly shabbier now and at his feet a basket with books
he holds a couple of volumes in his hands trying to interest passers by
szpilman also a little shabbier wends his way through the setters and buyers the beggars the passers by and reaches henryk
henryk drops the two volumes into the basket takes a handle one side of the basket szpilman the other
they set off
as they walk carrying the basket between them passing beggars and children asking for food you sell anything
thats better than yesterday
three lousy zlotys
and there are people here making millions
you dont know believe me
they bribe the guards
the guards turn a blind eye
theyre bringing in cartloads food tobacco liquor french cosmetics and the poor are dying all around them and they dont give a damn
suddenly a woman appears in front of them barring their way
shes brightly rouged with thickly painted eyebrows dressed in an old green velvet curtain with an unsteady mauve ostrich feather rising from her straw hat
excuse me but have you by any chance seen my husband izaak szerman
im afraid not
a tall handsome man with a little grey beard
they shake their heads
she is near to tears then smiles artificially
oh do forgive me
as she goes goodbye sleep well if you see him please do write izaak szermans his name
she wanders on
szpilman and henryk too continue on their way
and as they go sometimes i wish i could go mad
a stream of cars and trams
jewish policemen and german soldiers much in evidence
szpilman and henryk join a large crowd of jews waiting at a barrier to cross the intersection
the crowd is agitated impatient for a policeman to stop the traffic and let them through
a man next to szpilman and henryk is becoming more and more distraught shifting his weight from foot to foot taking off and putting on his hat
this is totally insane why do we have to have a gentile street running through our area
cant they go around
dont worry about it theyre about to build a bridge havent you heard
a bridge a schmidge and the germans claim to be intelligent
you know what i think
i think theyre totally stupid
ive got a family to feed and i spend half my time here waiting for them to let us through
meanwhile a street band begins to play a waltz
jewish policemen and german soldiers are clearing a space shoving jews out of the way including szpilman henryk and the nervous man
other soldiers are clearing a space
two german soldiers pull out of the crowd a tall woman and a short man and haul them into the cleared space
the couple dance to the street bands waltz
at intervals german soldiers select even more unlikely couples a fat woman with a painfully thin man a young boy with an elderly woman two men and two cripples
the german soldiers are to various degrees amused
one of them is almost hysterical with laughter
go on faster
the couples dance as fast as they can
a soldier kicks one of the cripples who cant go on any more
then a whistle blows a policeman stops the traffic the barrier swings open and people swarm across in both directions
szpilman and henryk enter and stop
good theyre here
yitzchak hellers been waiting for you henryk
seated at the table with mother and father is a uniformed young man yitzchak heller unusual appearance a man with red hair and a hitler moustache
heller remains seated just nods at the brothers
whats this about
sit down have tea ill start lunch when the girls get back
henryk and szpilman sit
they eye heller suspiciously
so what are you doing here
he brought cakes
his fathers back in the jewellery business and doing well isnt that so yitzchak
he runs dry
another awkward silence
then were recruiting
dont be clever with me henryk
ive come here as a friend
theyre bringing jews in from all over the country
soon therell be half a million people in the ghetto
we need more jewish police
more jewish police
you mean you want me to wear a cap like yours beat up jews with my truncheon and catch the gestapo spirit
eyes narrowed dangerous someones got to do it henryk
but why me
i thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers
look at my father look at us i mean
interrupting flaring yes im looking at you and thats why im here
your whole family can have a better life
you want to go on struggling for survival selling books on the street
a smile yes please
to szpilman im doing you people a favour
and what about you wladek
youre a great pianist
and weve got an excellent police jazz band
theyd welcome you with open arms
youve got no work
but ive got work
heller rises angrily
on a platform szpilman plays at a piano but he can hardly be heard above the noise of chatter and laughter
the large cafe is crowded hot and smoke filled
well heeled customers pimps whores businessmen sit at little tables eating talking laughing almost drowning the piano music
a couple of tables back from the piano a customer is doing business with a friend
the customer has a small stack of coins some of them twenty dollar gold pieces
he folds back the tablecloth to reveal a marble surface beneath
he drops a coin on the marble and listens but the noise is too loud
he sees the cafe owner benek fiftyish and makes gestures pointing at szpilman
benek pushes his way through to szpilman
whispering into szpilmans ear im sorry mr wladek he wants you to stop
continuing to play who wants me to stop
benek points to the customer who makes an imploring gesture to szpilman
szpilman stops playing
the friend watches the customer intently as he drops the coins one by one onto the marble
he drops them puts his ear close and listens
two or three he discards but he smiles when coins make a pure tone and he keeps them
szpilman exchanges looks with a pretty whore who makes eyes at him
satisfied the customer beams nods his thanks to szpilman who resumes his piano playing
he passes emaciated children and beggars
he steps over the corpses lying on the sidewalk
the wall runs the length of the street dividing it in half and narrowing it
buildings on one side the wall on the other
szpilman walks along
a piercing whistle from the aryan side
two women appear from a doorway approach the wall and look up
two or three packages come flying over from the aryan side
the women grab them and disappear
szpilman walks on and sees a child appear through a hole at ground level
the child wriggles through then turns pulls a package after him and runs
szpilman walks on hears a noise looks back to see a second child trying to wriggle through the same hole
but hes stuck
angry german voices from the aryan side
szpilman goes to him pulls him with all his might but the boy is jammed in the hole
from the other side of the wall the sound of an angry german voice and of a boot stamping violently on the boy
the boy screams in agony
szpilman continues to try to pull the boy through
the sound of the german voice swearing and the dull crunching noise made by the boot smashing into the boy continues and with every thud the boy screams in terrible
szpilman struggles to help the boy whose screams are becoming weaker yet increasingly desperate
szpilman pulls his arms and finally manages to get him through
the boy lies moaning
szpilman takes the boys face in his hands tries to comfort him revive him but the boy has stopped moaning
his head lolls and his jaw sags
he is dead
szpilman stands quickly and hurries away
szpilman approaches the house through a shabby yard
the noise of a mimeograph machine
a huge cheerful man with a perpetual cigarette in his mouth
i always say look on the bright side
youre in the small ghetto intellectuals professional people youre better off than us
here in the large ghetto its a cesspool
but you youre living in monte carlo
you could say youre privileged and that of course goes against my principles
he laughs and coughs starts looking through papers
his room is piled from floor to ceiling with old papers and stuff
dark shabby run down
one of his sons symche is operating the mimeograph machine
the other dolek is sorting the sheets as they come off the roller
zyskind holding a toddler is cooking at a small stove
jehuda finds what hes been looking for a newspaper made up of a few sheets
todays news from the other side
youre amazing jehuda
no im a socialist
i have brothers everywhere
they bring me news and food
we care about our fellow human beings
workers of the world unite
so whats the news
scanning the paper the germans are advancing on kharkhov
i dont know why i come here every evening its always such bad news
bad news you crazy
you have no world view wladek thats your trouble
the news couldnt be better
the moment hitler invaded russia i knew wed be all right
the germans will freeze to death please god
szpilman leans over takes a sheet from the mimeograph
jehuda give me something to do
youre an artist wladek you keep peoples spirits up
you do enough
but i want to help i want to
youre too well known wladek
and you know what
you musicians dont make good conspirators
he loves this laughs coughs
there are notices going up
the citys to be cleansed of undesirables
there are always notices going up
a distinctive knock on the door
szpilman tenses but jehuda beams
to one of his boys symche the boy opens the door to admit a short neat man majorek
hello symche dolek mrs zyskind jehuda
he stops seeing szpilman
majorek this is the greatest pianist in poland maybe in the whole world
shakes szpilmans hand i know your name
ive never heard you play
majorek used to be in the army
hes got a mind like a searchlight
the only thing ive got against him is hes not a socialist
he looks out of the window
youd better go now wladek
its nearly curfew
he hands over pamphlets to majorek
you see these wladek
you know how many copies we print of our newspaper
you know how many people on average read one copy
that makes ten thousand readers
these will start the uprising
majorek hides them in his underpants
and leaves them in toilets
as many toilets as i can find
germans never go into jewish toilets
theyre too clean for them
jehuda loves this too but his laugh makes him cough appallingly
the windows are open and the sounds of the ghetto can be heard in the background
the family sit round the small table as mother comes with a saucepan of soup and starts to serve
and please tonight for once i dont want anything bad talked about
lets enjoy our meal
okay then ill tell you something funny
you know who i mean by dr
well for some reason dont ask me why the germans allowed him into the ghetto to perform an operation
on a jew
they allowed a pole to come in to operate on a jew
he got a pass thats all i know
anyway he puts the patient to sleep and starts the operation
hed just made the first incision when the ss burst in shoot the patient lying on the table and then shoot dr
raszeja and everybody else who was there
isnt that a laugh
the patient didnt feel a thing he was anaesthetised he laughs
no one else does
henryk i said nothing bad
whats the matter with you all
have you lost your sense of humour
its not funny
well you know whats funny
youre funny with that ridiculous tie
what are you talking about my tie
whats my tie got to do with anything
i need the tie for my work
your work yes playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto they dont give a damn about peoples sufferings they dont even notice whats going on around them
i blame the americans
the others look at him
for my tie
american jews and theres lots of them what have they done for us
what do they think theyre doing
people here are dying havent got a bite to eat
the jewish bankers over there should be persuading america to declare war on germany
suddenly theres a roar of engines and a screech of brakes
slamming of doors
the family rush to the windows
a gestapo vehicle has entered the street and screeched to a halt
helmeted jackbooted ss men led by an nco pour out of the vehicle
the szpilmans gather at their open window to watch
regina turns off the lights before joining them
they are all terrified
their half eaten meal still on the table behind them
pov from szpilman apartment the building opposite
the ss men pouring into the building opposite
sound of the jackboots on stairs
lights go on floor by floor
in an apartment directly opposite a businessman his wife three young people and an old man in a wheelchair sit at their dining table
the ss men burst in machine pistols at the ready
the family is frozen with horror remain seated
the nco scans their faces
in a towering rage stand up
the family rise to their feet fast except for the old man in the wheelchair
the nco bears down on him
the old man in the wheelchair grips the arms of the chair and tries desperately to stand
but he cant
without warning the ss men seize the chair with the old man in it carry him out on to the balcony
mother screams father shrinks back halina comforts him and regina comforts mother
szpilmans and henryk s pov the apartment opposite the ss men throw the old man in his wheelchair over the balcony
he seems to hang in the air for a second then drops out of the chair and out of sight
but theres a terrible thud as his body hits the pavement and a clatter as the wheelchair follows him
the others still horrified
softly to mother be quiet mama for gods sake be quiet
then sound of shots slamming doors screams shouts
szpilman and henryk hurry to another window so that they can see whats going on
their pov from second window building opposite and street ss men herding a couple of dozen prisoners from the building opposite
people watching from the windows but trying not to be seen
the headlights of the ss vehicle are switched on and the ss men are forcing their prisoners to stand in the beam
the prisoners start to run
the ss men open fire with a machine gun mounted on the vehicle
people in the building opposite begin to scream
the prisoners are being shot down
they are lifted into the air by the bullets turn somersaults fall dead
one man escapes by running back in the opposite direction out of the beam of light and is lost to sight for a moment
the escaping man a silhouette out of the light runs with all his strength putting distance between himself and the ss
he starts to scale a wall
he looks as though hes getting away
but theres a floodlight on the ss vehicle
it flares into light swivels and finds the man
a volley of shots
the man drops from the wall dead
the ss men get into the vehicle and speed off driving over the dead bodies
szpilman and henryk stare at the scene silent shocked
the only sounds the weeping of the people opposite and nearer mother crying softly
szpilman as if in another world playing the piano
the cafe is full of customers but the atmosphere is much more subdued than previously the mood is sombre
a doorman with a cudgel beats away the beggars from the door as halina distraught and out of breath runs to the cafe entrance
the doorman lets her in
szpilman snaps out of his reverie seeing across the heads of the customers halina in a state of great anxiety beckoning urgently
szpilman quickly brings the piece to a close stands steps off the platform threads his way through to halina
shes shivering almost unable to speak
almost incoherent oh my god its terrible youve got to do something oh my god
shaking her calm down what what is it
theyre hunting people on the streets
theyve picked up henryk
szpilman sweating dodges and sidesteps
then suddenly a woman bars his way
shes the feather woman brightly rouged with her thickly painted eyebrows the unsteady mauve ostrich feather rising from her straw hat
excuse me but have you seen my husband izaak szerman
im afraid not
he tries to dodge past but she grabs his arm
hes tall hes handsome
he has a little grey beard
if you see him please do write izaak szermans his name dont forget
szpilman manages to free himself and runs on
a mob of men in front of the building being herded this way and that by jewish policemen
more and more captive men are brought in by the german schutzpolizei shupos
the mob constantly swelling
szpilman reaches the back of the crowd
to an elderly man nearest him whats happening
theyve got my grandson in there
they pick em up they take em away
what do they do to them
ive stopped believing in god
szpilman scans the mob
the jewish policemen using batons and whips to herd the men
no sign of henryk
szpilman becomes alert
hes seen someone he recognises
heller with his red hair and hitler moustache wielding a baton driving men into the building
with difficulty szpilman pushes his way through the mob and gets nearer to heller
heller doesnt hear
heller glances round
heller shoves someone aside so that szpilman can approach but he continues to beat and manhandle people
henryks in there
i havent seen him
believe me theyve picked him up
can you help
oh you need me now yes now you need me
can you help us
ive no money
then theres nothing i can do
he shouldve joined us when i gave him the chance
yitzchak they told me you had influence
who told you
people i know
they said youre an important man
heller just glares at szpilman and then moves away
szpilman stands jostled by the crowd uncertain forlorn
szpilman keeping to the shadows of the alleyway watches the front of the building
comings and goings
german soldiers in evidence
the mob is smaller now
szpilman waits and watches and then a poor woman passes carrying a can wrapped in newspaper followed by a ragged old man dragging himself along
hes shivering with cold his shoes with holes show his purple feet
the ragged old man suddenly lunges forward and tries to grab the can from the poor woman
they struggle desperately
screaming a snatcher
help me a snatcher
the can falls to the pavement and thick steaming soup pours into the dirty street
szpilman watches rooted to the spot
the ragged old man stares at the can lets out a groan more like a whimper and throws himself full length in the slush licking the soup up from the
the poor woman starts to howl kicking the old man and tearing at her hair in despair
then boys keep your peckers up
and girls keep your legs crossed
rubinstein a ragged dishevelled little man chaplinesque waving a stick hopping and jumping approaches the germans outside the bureau
dont let em get you down he approaches a couple of shupos
he waves his stick at them
one of them bows low
good day herr rubinstein
if that means good day im your man you gangsters robbers pirates
tapping his head mad
ich bin meshuge you bandit
almost in tears with laughter they give him a cigarette and he goes on his way
szpilman almost smiles then looks again at the building
sun just setting
from the shelter of the alleyway szpilman continues to watch the entrance of the bureau
no mob any more but people come and go jewish policemen shupos a few jews
almost continuous sounds of distant shots and screams
then heller appears at the entrance looks this way and that and goes back inside the building
again heller appears in the entrance
he beckons someone inside
henryk shuffles out
heller shoves him into the street
henryk stumbles falls
szpilman runs to him helps him to his feet
immediately on the attack furious you go to heller did i ask you to talk to him
youre out arent you
they start to walk
did you beg did you grovel to that piece of shit that cockroach
i didnt grovel i asked him to help
what did you pay him
with what could i pay him

i can look after myself
they were taking you away
its nothing to do with you
its me they wanted not you
why do you interfere in other peoples business
youre mad thats your trouble youre mad
thats also my business
they walk on
a wooden bridge has been constructed linking the small ghetto to the large ghetto
few people about mostly beggars and children
szpilman and henryk climb the stairs of the bridge but as they reach the bridge itself henryk stumbles sinks to his knees
szpilman gets hold of him tries to help him stand
whats the matter
are you sick
szpilman supports henryk helps him towards the back of the cafe
henryk finishing a bowl of soup and a piece of bread sits at a worktop with szpilman and benek
the kitchen is small and busy with cooks waiters washers up
whats that mean no employment certificate
you have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the german firms in the ghetto otherwise
youll be deported
so the rumours were true
theyre going to resettle us
send us to labour camps
in the east
and theyre closing the small ghetto
a dense crowd of people crossing the bridge in both directions
szpilman shabby and unshaven hurries along and meets jehuda zyskind coming towards him accompanied by the small man majorek
i thought youd be off on tour playing london paris new york
trying to smile not this week
theyre buffeted by the crowd
in the street below them cars trams pedestrians and german guards
i have to say you look terrible
whats the trouble

dismissing him rumours rumours you take it all too much to heart wladek
ive been trying to get a certificate of employment for my father

thats die historical imperative in action and thats why i always say look on
joining with him the bright side yes i know
the name samuel szpilman being written on a certificate
the clatter of sewing machines
schultz a fat sweaty german is filling out the form at his desk
majorek beside him standing chatting to him and having a quiet laugh
in the doorway szpilman and father
the small office is on an upper level with a window looking down on the factory floor where jewish men and women are hard at work on sewing machines making
the terrible clatter
schultz stamps the certificate hands it to majorek who gives it to father
doffing his hat thank you
beaming german accent my pleasure
it wont help you anyway
a great mass of agitated people crossing only one way from the small ghetto to the large ghetto carrying their belongings
a german film crew records the scene
the szpilmans among the crowd lugging suitcases and bundles henryk with a few books father carrying his violin case
they struggle across the bridge
a truck backing up
the tail gate is opened to reveal a huge load of furniture linen clothing mirrors carpets bedclothes
three jews inside the van start to unload the stuff dumping it in the yard
other jews stand ready to start sorting the load among them the szpilman family
shupos and jewish policemen supervise
each has their allotted task szpilman and henryk sort out carpets father mirrors regina linen halina and mother clothing
the sounds of trains not far off
they carry the stuff into the warehouse
szpilman and the others bring their piles of things into the warehouse which is crammed with similar objects an aladdins cave
the activity continuous
a large room with an improvised partition of blankets to separate the men from the women
three tiered bunks
on the mens side father is on the upper bunk henryk on the lower
szpilman stripping down to his underwear is preparing to climb into the middle bunk
at least weve got work in the ghetto
at least were still together
szpilman nods climbs into his bunk settles down
somewhere near the sound of a train
then a volley of shots german voices shouting
szpilman slips off his bunk hurries to the door opens it and comes face to face with a german nco and soldiers
assemble in the yard
were employed here weve got certificates the nco cracks szpilman across the face turns and goes
szpilman retreats into the room his nose bleeding
the women are watching from behind the blankets but mother hurries towards szpilman
she wipes his nose
shots shouts a scream
still quite dark
the szpilmans and about twenty others lined up under lights shining on them from a couple of german vehicles
the nco goes along the line making a selection using his pistol to prod people into moving
when he gets to the szpilmans he selects henryk and halina
then he turns to those who are left the rest of you get dressed then report back here
bring your belongings
fifteen kilos only
where are you taking us
the nco turns his pistol on the young woman and shoots her through the head
he marches off while she lies on the ground with blood spurting out of her
the partition has been pulled aside
people including the szpilmans are dressing or dressed packing up their belongings
im sorry i did my best i thought the certificates would save us all
stop it wladek
lets just hope that henryk and halina will be better off sounds of shots screams shouts a piercing whistle
hot fine summers day
jews among them szpilman mother regina and father clutching their meagre belongings walk towards wooden gates and come to a halt
jewish policemen approach and order the people about pushing and shoving them into line
to a jewish policeman where will we be going
youre going to work
youll be much better off than in this stinking ghetto
the gates are the gates are opened
they shuffle forward
szpilman mother regina and father with others enter through one of the gates which closes on them
they pause for a moment to take in their new surroundings
the szpilmans and their pov their first sight of the large rectangle walled on two sides and overlooked by buildings
several hundred people
people walk up and down
lets sit over there
but he stops again and so do the others
something they see causes them to stand stock still expressionless
an unoccupied space at the edge of the compound where bloated decaying bodies lie near to a wall
the wall itself is spattered with blood
large flies walk over the dead
nobody goes near
szpilman turns away and leads the others to another space
later glaring sun
the szpilmans have settled down on the kerb of a pavement and are waiting
szpilman stands observing the scene
mother sits on a bundle of things staring vacantly her hair hanging down in strands
regina beside her has her hands over her face and is weeping the tears running through her fingers
father walks nervously up and down hands behind his back four steps one way four steps back
near them a young woman begins to wail
why did i do it
why did i do it
a young man beside her whispers to her but she does not seem to take in what hes saying
her cries continue at intervals
why did i do it
why did i do it
the sound of trucks
everyone looks towards the gates
more jews are being unloaded from trucks and are marched through the gates
mothers children old people begging most of them holding papers
later the sun high blazing
szpilman is wandering around occasionally greeting people
the place is crowded now packed
trucks bring more and more jews at intervals
old people lying down exhausted impossible to tell whether some of them are alive or dead
women carrying dehydrated children drag themselves from group to group
one woman approaches szpilman
hes dying dont you have a drop of water
my childs dying of thirst hes dying hes dying i beg you
szpilman shakes his head sadly
the woman with child wanders off to another group
im telling you its a disgrace
szpilman turns to see a man dr
ehrlich haranguing father
i can hear you
szpilman goes to them
overlapping were letting them take us to our death like sheep to the slaughter
ehrlich not so loud
why dont we attack them
theres half a million of us we could break out of the ghetto
at least we could die honourably not as a stain on the face of history
another man grun joins in
why you so sure theyre sending us to our death
im not sure
you know why im not sure
because they didnt tell me
but im telling you they plan to wipe us all out
ehrlich what do you want me to do
you want me to fight
to fight you need organisation plans guns
what dyou think i can do
fight them with my violin bow
the germans would never squander a huge labour force like this
theyre sending us to a labour camp
look at that cripple look at those old people the children theyre going to work
look at mr szpilman here hes going to carry iron girders on his back
a loud cry from mother
szpilman and father spin round
glancing up shocked oh my god
near the gates among a large bunch of new arrivals henryk and halina
regina and szpilman also call and wave
henryk and halina struggle through to them
halina falls into mothers arms and they hug
we heard you were here
we wanted to be with you
mother comforts her
and so does regina
father smiles sadly
shakes his head almost to himself a forlorn smile stupid stupid
why did i do it
why did i do it
szpilman stands and stares at her
later the sun lower but the heat still intense
the place is now packed to suffocation
people calling out names trying to find each other
the wailing of women and the cries of children
a cordon of jewish policemen and ss guards are almost surreptitiously ringing the compound
the szpilmans sit in the same place with henryk sitting a little apart and now reading a small book
why did i do it
why did i do it
shes getting on my nerves
what did she do for gods sake
grun leans across to her
quietly to halina she smothered her baby
halina looks at him in disbelief
theyd prepared a hiding place and so of course they went there
but the baby cried just as the police came
she smothered the cries with her hands
the baby died
a policeman heard the death rattle
he found where they were hiding
later szpilman and henryk
what are you reading
a crooked ironic smile if you prick us do we not bleed
if you tickle us do we not laugh
if you poison us do we not die
and if you wrong us shall we not revenge
szpilman takes the book and reads the title page very appropriate
taking the book back and resuming his reading yes thats why i brought it
later the szpilmans seated on the kerb
their attention is caught by a boy who has a box of sweets on a string round his neck
and hes setting the sweets pocketing money
whats he think hes going to do with the money
father calls to the sweet boy and beckons him over
how much for a caramel
for one caramel
what dyou think youre going to do with the money
turning to the family have we got twenty between us
they search their pockets and handbags hand over to father what change they can find
he in turn hands the money to the sweet boy who hands over one caramel and goes on his way
father holds the caramel between thumb and forefinger and examines it carefully
then carefully takes out his penknife and with great care divides the caramel into six pans
he hands a part to each of the family
they all exchange a look an acknowledgement of each other almost like a toast and then they chew slowly deliberately
the whistle of a locomotive
sound of trucks rattling over the rails
at once a sound of great agitation from the jews in the compound
the locomotive pulling cattle and goods trucks comes into sight rolling slowly towards the boundary of the umschlagplatz and coming to a halt
a cordon of jewish policeman and ss guards
among the great throng of people the szpilmans trudge towards the train
szpilman and halina walking
funny time to say this
wish i knew you better
a smile thanks
the szpilmans near the train
the first trucks are already full the people inside pressed close together ss men pushing them with their rifle butts
people in the trucks cry out in desperation
the szpilmans are pushed along by ss men along the cordon of jewish policemen past loaded trucks
then suddenly szpilman
a jewish policeman grabs szpilman by his collar and pulls him back out of the police cordon
the rest of the family have reached the next truck to be filled
a scuffle as szpilman tries to resist
another jewish policeman shoves him
szpilman stumbles falls to the ground in front of him the closed ranks of the jewish policemens backs
he stands runs at the cordon seeing between their heads shoulders mother regina henryk and halina clambering into the trucks
father is looking around bewildered
father sees him takes a step towards him but stops smiling helplessly
he raises his hand and waves then turns and goes towards the trucks
again szpilman flings himself at the policemens shoulders
heller turns on him
what do you think youre doing szpilman
ive saved your life
now go on save yourself
szpilman stands for a moment confused terrified
then he turns and starts to run
szpilman drops to walking pace makes for the gates
workers are pushing carts piled with the bloated corpses that lay against the wall
szpilman falls in with them and they pass through the gates
the doors of the trucks are closed
the train begins to move
from the trucks the faint cries of the occupants
szpilman catches his breath by a building
an ss man and jewish policeman emerge
the jewish policeman is servile crawling to the german
he points to the train well off they go for meltdown
they laugh as they walk away
szpilman turns and stumbles down the empty street
the cries from the trucks fading
he begins to weep loud agonised sobs and staggers on
szpilman lost empty aimless tries to catch his breath in the aftermath of his tears
he wanders forlornly down the street passing empty buildings with their doors open windows smashed
furniture torn mattresses and pillows lie scattered
he turns a corner
szpilman comes into the courtyard
he stops his face blank
lying outside the door the bodies of jehuda mrs
zyskind their two sons and the toddler
szpilman steps across the bodies
papers pamphlets strewn all over the place
the mimeograph smashed
szpilman enters stands surveying the devastation
distant sounds of shooting shouts cries
he gathers up some papers in a pile takes off his jacket and covers the pile of papers making a pillow
he lies down on the floor
he stares into the darkness expressionless empty
szpilman shuffles along comes to the cafe
no sign of life but the door is wide open
he goes inside
szpilman wanders through the upturned tables broken chairs
stops looks about
distant shots automatic fire
he turns and makes for the door
then he hears an urgent hiss
he turns sharply and tries to find the source of it
he hears the hiss again
now he sees hiding under the platform benek beckoning to him
szpilman hurries over and crawls on his back until hes beside him
benek replaces a plank and they are hidden from view
thin slivers of light illuminate the two men on their backs in the cramped space
looking at him mystified why are you here mr
its like this
all of them
he cant continue
perhaps theyre lucky
the quicker the better
it isnt over yet
well stay here for a couple of days
until things die down
another pause ive bribed a policeman
hell come when its over
in bright sun szpilman and benek march in a column four abreast under the command of two jewish foremen guarded by two german policemen
they are being marched out of the ghetto gates
to benek my god
i havent been outside for it must be two years
on the other side of him dont get over excited
street traders with baskets full of wares fruit vegetables fish tins of preserves
women bargain with them making purchases
dealers in gold and currency calling monotonously
gold buy gold
later szpilman on top of a free standing scaffold benek and the others demolishing a ghetto wall wielding skdgehammers
they work slowly
a smartly dressed young couple are passing but stop
the young woman is extremely attractive and knows it
the foremen workers and the german policemen ogle her
look oh do look
her young man is puzzled she points
cant be the first time youve ever seen jews
embarrassed she giggles and they go
szpilman benek and the others continue to work
the foremen sit sunning themselves and the german policemen stand deep in conversation ignoring the workers
szpilman suddenly stops work
he has seen something in the square that alerts him
at the furthest stall he sees a woman attractive chic in her thirties buying vegetables at a stall
her name is janina godlewska
surreptitiously szpilman raises a hand trying to catch her attention
but hes frightened of alerting the german policemen and the foremen
benek has noticed
someone you know
again szpilman tries but janina her profile to him doesnt see
who is she
her husbands an actor
i knew them well
id like to talk to her
playful dont forget mr
wladek they hang them for helping jews
he goes back to work
the german policemen wander over to one of the stalls to buy fruit
the moment they do so two jewish workers scamper across to another stall to buy bread
szpilman glances across the square janina is still at the stall
he comes to a decision
he jumps down is about to dash towards janina but stops dead
janina is no longer there
as before szpilman and benek march towards the ghetto gates in the demolition column four abreast under the command of the jewish foremen and guarded by the two german policemen
the column halts before a young ss man wild eyed with his sleeves rolled up and wielding a pistol
he talks excitedly to the policemen then turns walks along the column dividing them up some men to the right others seven of them to the left
benek he orders to the left szpilman to the right
young ss man turns to those on the left
terrified they obey
he stands over them and one by one shoots them
when he comes to benek the seventh man his pistol runs out of ammunition
he changes the clip shoots benek and marches off
szpilman bent almost double carries a hod on his back piled with bricks
he is mounting a wooden ramp that runs up beside scaffolding on a small building site where an extra floor is being added to a house
there are polish workers too who dont of course wear armbands as the jews do
theres a wooden hut serving as a store on the site
halfway up the ramp szpilman hears someone whistle
he stops turns to see at the bottom of the ramp majorek smiling and giving a discreet wave
later szpilman and majorek sip gruel out of mugs
they sit apart from the others who are also taking a break
how long have you been here
since last night
i was pleased to see you
theyre going to start the final resettlement now
we know what it means
we sent someone out
a good man
his orders were to follow the trains out of warsaw
he got to sokolow
a local railwayman told him the tracks are divided one branch leading to treblinka
he said every day freight trains carrying people from warsaw forked to treblinka and returned empty
no transports of food are ever seen on that line
and civilians are forbidden to approach the treblinka station
theyre exterminating us
wont take them long
were sixty thousand left
out of half a million
mostly young people
and this time were going to fight
were in good shape
if you need help
a little later szpilman again mounting the ramp with a hod full of bricks on his back
the noise of airplanes overhead
a swarm of russian bombers
anti aircraft fire
puffs of exploding shells
the workers look up
so does szpilman and as he does so the bricks slide off his hod crashing to the ground below
an ss man zick zack his nickname with a whip approaches szpilman
szpilman goes to him
enraged zick zack grabs him by the hair and presses his head hard between his thighs and then beats him mercilessly
with every stroke hissing through clenched teeth und zick
after a dozen or so strokes szpilman falls forward and lies in the dirt
zick zack nods satisfied
get him away from here
two poles without armbands one of them bartczak drag him away
bartczak and the other man help szpilman to his feet
hope you played the piano better than you carry bricks
he wont last long if he goes on like this
ill see if i can get him something better
the store a wooden hut contains wood nails tools paint metal brackets
szpilman sits at a table where a line of workers has formed
szpilman makes a record in a ledger of the tools each worker takes out on the site
a worker puts his head into the store
only the jews
poles go on working
only the jews
poles go on working
the jewish workers start to assemble on the site in haphazard ranks as an ss captain strides in
the ss captain with much jollity and jokes hops up on to scaffolding and stands beaming broadly surveying the workers
in english i have important and good news for you
there are rumours circulating that resettlement measures are again going to be taken
a glance between szpilman and majorek
in english i want to assure you personally that no such measures will be taken now or in the future
posters will be going up also to this effect
as proof of our good will we want you to select a delegate who will be permitted to go into town once a day to buy on each workers behalf
five kilos of potatoes and one loaf of bread which you will be allowed to take back into the ghetto
now why would we do that j if we meant to resettle you
he beams no reaction from the workers
in english you can do good business on what you dont eat
isnt that what you jews are best at
rubs thumb and forefinger and leers still no reaction his smile vanishes
in english carry on
majorek pulls a barrow by a rope attached to its shaft across the site
on the barrow five sacks
the jewish workers are phased to see him
majorek pulls the barrow to where szpilman waits
under his breath the smaller one
at the bottom
szpilman nods and starts unloading the sacks as majorek moves away
szpilman has unpacked the sacks and laid them in the corner
he kneels before the smallest of the sacks and unties the string around its neck
he puts his hand inside the sack and potatoes tumble out
he reaches to the bottom and is still as his hand finds something
carefully he removes a pistol then another both wrapped in oil cloths
he hides them under his jacket
szpilman and a jewish worker distribute the potatoes to the other jewish workers lined up with empty containers of various kinds
there are scales on the table and they weigh out five kilos of potatoes pour them into the mens containers and drop in a loaf of bread
the jewish workers all carrying their parcels of potatoes and bread march back towards the ghetto gates escorted by two polish policemen
szpilman walks beside them
ahead of him majorek near the front of the column
as the column nears the ghetto gates majorek tosses his package over the wall and when szpilman reaches the same spot he throws a similar package
the column marches on
a small room with several three tiered bunk beds
the sound of mens heavy breathing and snoring
szpilman lies awake staring at the ceiling
he reaches inside his jacket finds a scrap of paper and a pencil writes something
he slips off his bunk and crosses to another set of bunks crouches down at the bottom one where majorek sleeps
majorek is instantly awake
have a favour to ask
i want to get out of here
its easy to get out its how you survive on the other side thats hard
but last summer i worked for a day in zelazna brama square
i saw someone i knew
her husbands an actor
theyre old friends
he holds out the piece of paper
ive written their names down
and their address
if theyre still there
janina godlewska and andrzej bogucki
majorek you go into the town every day
would you try and make contact
ask them if theyd help me get out of here
majorek takes the paper but says nothing
he turns over and goes back to sleep
szpilman returns to his bunk
szpilman has unloaded the sacks of potatoes into the corner and is kneeling about to untie the string on the smallest sack
a sound alerts him
he looks round
an ss lieutenant has entered the stores sucking his finger which is bleeding
any fucking plaster
szpilman immediately hurries to a cupboard finds a first aid tin removes a plaster and gives it to the ss lieutenant
while he applies the plaster to his finger what were you up to
nothing from szpilman
what the fuck are those
he indicates the sacks with his chin
in german were allowed to take food into the ghetto
five kilos of potatoes and a
the ss lieutenant walks over to the sacks and kicks the smallest one
its only potatoes and bread
fuck that youre lying i can smell it
szpilman tries to untie the string but hes too terrified and cant manage it
the ss lieutenant shoves him out of the way then takes from his belt a dagger and cuts the string
the ss lieutenant reaches in and withdraws a handful of long yellow beans
he glowers at szpilman reaches in again produces a handful of oatmeal
youre all the same
give a jew a little finger he takes the whole hand
he throws the oatmeal in szpilmans face
you lie to me again and ill shoot you personally
he kicks szpilman viciously and marches away
szpilman catches his breath then quickly reaches into the bottom of the sack and finds a pistol and ammunition
he hides them under his clothes
the jewish workers with their bundles of potatoes and bread march back towards the ghetto gates escorted by the two polish policemen
in the column szpilman near the policeman with the moustache and a little behind them majorek
distant sounds of gunfire
majorek falls in beside szpilman
i tried your friends
theyre not at that address any more
you made contact
be ready to leave in two days time
same place as last night
sudden frantic cries from the head of the column which comes to a stop
two ss men blind drunk drinking vodka from bottles are lashing the column with whips
one of them is zikk zack
as the ss men advance on szpilman and majoreks section majorek slips back to his place in the column
szpilman hides his package inside his coat
zick zack lashes out at the workers blindly
he takes a swig of vodka and comes face to face with szpilman
shouting ill soon teach you discipline
he is staring directly at szpilman with glassy eyes
szpilman is terrified trying as surreptitiously as possible to cover his hidden package with his hands
a moment of danger
zick zack grabs szpilman by the cottar
know why we beat you
no response shaking him
know why we beat you
tentatively in german no
to celebrate new years eve
he and his comrade find this hilarious recovering from his laughter
go on march
the column starts to march
sing something cheerful
and sing it good and loud
a brief silence then from the back a solo voice starts to sing children of warsaw will go to fight
szpilman glances back sees that its majorek singing
szpilman smiles majorek nods
szpilman joins in
now so do the others
they march on singing lustily
singing hey ranks unite and follow the white eagle
stand up and fight our mortal enemy
lets give them fire and brimstone
well blow away the yoke of slavery
punish and rout the rapists of our nation
well smash the knout to save our dignity
soon well be proud of our liberation hey take your sights
aim sharply at the heart
give em a bloody start
aim sharply at the heart
the column reaches the lamp posts near the ghetto gates
szpilman his package over the wall
so does majorek
the jewish workers lined up to get their potatoes and bread
szpilman and two others weigh the potatoes
get on with it and fall in
calmly szpilman leaves the table with the scales walks past majorek and the others who having got their potatoes are assembling in a column preparing to march back into the
the polish workers have packed up their tools and are talking among themselves also about to leave the site but in a casual way
the ss guards shout orders for the jewish column to move off
szpilman seems as if hes going to join them but at the last moment turns and falls in with the polish workers beside barczak who just glances at him then
moves so that szpilman is in the middle of the group
szpilman slips off his armband stuffs it into his pocket
the group walk into the darkness
szpilman walks fast to the corner stops looks round anxiously
he takes the armband from his pocket and drops it through the grating of a drain in the gutter just as theres movement in a darkened doorway
then out of the darkness of the doorway a woman janina she turns and starts to walk quickly
szpilman putting the collar of his coat up follows keeping pace
a pedestrian walks past in the opposite direction but pays them no attention
janina and szpilman walk on
janina comes to the front door opens it with a key goes in
szpilman a little distance behind catches up and follows her inside
janina waits as szpilman closes the front door then starts up the stairs
she stops turns to him smiles kisses him on the cheek then continues up the stairs
andrzej bogucki a handsome man fortyish tries to conceal his sense of shock at seeing szpilman he holds out his hand and szpilman shakes it
szpilman looks around the nicely furnished large apartment
he looks at bogucki and janina
tears well up in his eyes
he fights it hard not to cry
so does janina
we havent much time
szpilman lies in a steaming bath eyes closed as though hes in a trance
a gentle knock on the door and bogucki slips in with some clothes
he gazes at szpilman whose eyes remain closed
you must hurry
bogucki holds up a towel
szpilman lifts himself out of the bath and dries himself
were going to have to keep moving you
the germans are hunting down indiscriminately now
jews non jews anybody everybody
handing him the clothes see if these fit
and wladek youd better shave
use my razor
in the cabinet
the ceramic stove
szpilmans ghetto clothes torn into strips are being stuffed into it and burned
janina shoves the strips of clothes into the stove
szpilman now wearing boguckis suit and clean shaven watches the clothes burn while he spoons hot soup into his mouth
thank you i dont
youll be looked after by mr gebczynski
hes on the other side of town
youll stay there tonight
then well find you somewhere else
janina adds the last strip of clothing
ill bring you food
a rickshaw carrying szpilman and bogucki travels along the dark streets
the rickshaw comes to a halt outside a store
the moment it stops the shutters of the store are raised and bogucki escorts szpilman to the door then quickly returns to the rickshaw which moves off fast
gebcznyski shakes hands with szpilman ushers him in and then pulls down the shutter
gebczynskis store is for sanitary furnishings and supplies lavatories basins baths taps etc
ill show you where youre going to sleep
he leads the way and as he goes he picks up a cushion from a chair and a blanket
gebczynski leads szpilman down the stairs
shelves with taps washers pipes
gebczynski leads the may to a particular set of shelves
he puts aside the cushion and blanket then starts to push at the shelves
szpilman although puzzled helps
slowly the shelves move to reveal a secret compartment
its not going to be very comfortable
ill be fine
youll have to stay here until tomorrow afternoon
he helps szpilman into the compartment
weve got a flat for you
near the ghetto wall
but its safe
he hands over the cushion and the blanket to szpilman then putting his back to the shelves and his feet against the wall he pushes the shelves back into place
so that szpilman is now hidden
in the cramped space szpilman is not quite able to stretch full out
with difficulty he puts the cushion behind his head starts to cover himself with the blanket but stops seeing something
in niches neatly stacked rifles pistols grenades ammunition szpilman stares expressionless
szpilman and gebczynski wait with others at the stop as the tram trundles towards them and comes to a halt
as they board quietly to szpilman go as near to the front as possible to the german section
gebczynski and szpilman apprehensive push through the rear section packed with poles seated and standing until they reach a chain and a sign in the german section only three or
some read newspapers others stare into space or out of the windows but never looking at the poles
szpilman tries to appear as inconspicuous as possible
the tram rumbles on its way
gebczynski and szpilman come up the stairs to the landing and to a door
gebczynski unlocks the door and they go in
a charmingly furnished bed sitting room with a comfortable divan
gebczynski leads the way in
szpilman glances around goes to the window looks out
he can see a section of ghetto wall below
beyond it inside the ghetto a narrow street leading to deserted buildings
gebczynski comes up behind him
must feel better this side of the wall
yes but sometimes im still not sure which side of the wall im on
he leads szpilman to the small kitchen
gebczynski opens a cupboard to reveal potatoes bread
ill come again
and janina bogucki will visit twice a week
bring more food
see how you are
he closes the cupboard
gebczynski makes for the front door stops
yes now this is very important
in case of emergency i mean emergency go to this address
he hands over a scrap of paper shakes szpilmans hand and goes quickly
alone szpilman stands lost for a moment
then he takes off his shoe and stuffs the scrap of paper into it
while he does so his eyes light on the divan bed
he goes to it slips off his other shoe and lies down testing the divans springiness with his whole body
he smiles beatifically
he shuts his eyes and is instantly asleep
szpilman still fast asleep
voices wake him
he opens his eyes
hes not certain where he is for a moment
he hears the voices again coming from the adjoining flat
intrigued he rises goes closer to the watt puts his ear against it listens
after a brief silence angry puppydog what dyou mean you forgot
what dyou think i mean kitten
i forgot thats what i mean
you know what
you treat me like dirt
i treat you like dirt because you are dirt
youre a dirty pig
takes one to know one
szpilman is enjoying himself
then the sound of a piano being played with great feeling but a lot of wrong notes
you play like an angel kitten
the piano continues for a moment but suddenly stops if i play like an angel why dont you listen
i was listening kitten
liar you fell asleep
a door slams
wheedling kitten let me in
szpilman smiles but then hears the sound of rifle shots and a huge explosion
he crosses quickly to the window looks out
from the ghetto smoke drifting slowly
szpilman asleep on the divan
the roar of motor car and motorcycle engines
he wakes rushes to the window
a german personnel carrier an open car carrying officers and a motorcycle and sidecar roar down the narrow street below towards the buildings at the far end
german soldiers follow behind on the trot pulling a field gun
unseen marksmen fire down on the germans from the buildings
as the german soldiers dismount from their vehicles one of them is hit and falls
the others rush for cover
the german commander and two officers alight from the car and take cover
the commander orders the field gun to be trained on the buildings
spasmodic firing continues
he gives the order to fire
the gun roars
the shell tears into the building
at once the german soldiers open fire with their rifles and lob grenades into the building
the gun fires again
the building begins to burn
flames and smoke
german soldiers with flame throwers advance carefully then unleash their fire into doorways and windows and quickly retreat
at ground level jewish fighters try to fight their way out and are mowed down
the fire spreads quickly through the building
smoke begins to pour from the upper floors
the germans less cautious now stand and watch
a woman struggles out on to her narrow third floor balcony
she climbs over holds on to the wrought iron railings and hangs on for dear life
shots ring out and she drops like a stone
from inside the building screams and shouts
from another upper window a man in flames jumps and falls to his death on the pavement below
the germans have stopped firing
they stand spectators watching the building burn
szpilman at the window watching his mood downcast
the noise of a key in the door
he turns to see the door of the flat open
janina enters with a parcel of food
she kisses szpilman on the cheek
wanted to come earlier but
she hands him the parcel
he goes into the small kitchen and unpacks the contents while janina gazes out of the window
no one thought theyd hold out so long
should never have come out
i shouldve stayed there fought with them
turning to him wladek stop that
its over now
just be proud it happened
my god did they put up a fight
yes so did the germans
theyre in shock
they didnt expect it
nobody expected it
jews fighting back
whod have thought
yes but what good did it do
passionate what good
wladek im surprised at you
they died with dignity thats what good it did
and you know something else
now the poles will rise
well fight too
she turns to look again out of the window
the building burning
corpses lie scattered on the pavement
the germans stand about chatting and laughing
a handful of jewish fighters are lined up and shot
satisfied the commander returns to his car
another officer confers with him before the engine starts up and he is driven away
the building burns
the ghetto buildings now burned out shells the street empty
autumn leaves falling and gusting in the wind
szpilman gazes out
ice on the windows
the sound of the key in the door
szpilman turns as the door opens and gebczynski enters distraught
whispered at speed get your things together you have to leave
gebczynski takes out a cigarette and lights it
while he does so im on the run
the gestapo found our weapons
theyve arrested janina and andrzej
theyre bound to find out about this place too you must get away at once
where do you want me to go
look at me
no no im not leaving
cant i take my chances here
thats your decision
stubs out cigarette
but when they storm the flat throw yourself out of die window dont let them get you alive
i have poison on me they wont get me alive either
and he goes
szpilman listens to his footsteps clattering down the stairs
he sees the cigarette stub takes it lights it coughs smokes awkwardly
later szpilman hears a car engine and the screech of brakes
german voices shouting and their heavy footsteps on the stairs
he goes to the window opens it
he gets a chair places it sideways in front of the window to make a step
hes working out how best to throw himself out
he leans against the wall near the door and waits
slamming of doors german shouts a scream
szpilman steels himself ready to jump
again footsteps on the stairs but this time descending
a door slams
he cautiously goes to the window and looks out
in the street below he sees ss men escorting two prisoners and shoving into a car
the car speeds off
the street is empty
szpilman lies on the divan
he is cold unshaven hair filthy and long
he manages to rise
szpilman goes into the kitchen
from a bread tin he takes a small flat greaseproof paper parcel and unwraps it
a slice of bread stale and mouldy
he tries to bite it but cant
he finds a knife and tries to chop a piece off the bread but knocks the bread tin which falls to the floor with a clatter
he continues to try to cut the bread when theres a loud hammering on the front door
the hammering continues as szpilman stumbles into the room looks around confused not knowing what to do
from the other side of the door female voices words indistinct and then open this door at once or well call the police
he is galvanised into action puts on a crumpled jacket grabs his tattered coat and scarf collects up a few of his things stuffs them into a paper bag
the hammering stops
szpilman cautiously approaches the door listens then opens it quietly and slips out
he slips out of the flat goes to the stairs and stops dead
kitty young and fierce stands on the stairs blocking his way
are you from the flat in there
youre not registered
it belongs to a friend of mine
i came to visit but i must have just missed him
shouting have you got your identity card
let me see your identity card
szpilman hesitates she shouts more loudly
i want to see your identity card
on various floors doors open tenants put their heads out to see whats going on
summoning all his strength szpilman makes a dash for it pushing past kitty
screeching hes a jew
hes a jew
stop the jew
dont let him out
szpilman clatters down the stairs reaches the ground floor landing
another woman tries to bar his way but he pushes past her and out of the house
szpilman stumbles into the street and runs
he darts down a side street
szpilman lurches into the narrow street
no one about
he stops almost collapses but manages to keep hold of himself
he puts on his coat and wraps the scarf round his neck
he leans up against a wall
he removes a shoe and takes out the scrap of paper gebczynski gave him
he reads it
szpilman drags himself along trudging through snow and slush
passers by give him a wide berth
he tries to walk normally with dignity but hes weak and slips and finds the going hard
he comes to a villa
he goes to the front door rings the bell and waits
from behind the door yes
mr gebczynski sent me
the door opens and dorota stands there
she is pregnant
they stand for a moment staring at each other
a whisper wladyslaw szpilman
szpilman follows dorota into the living room
im sorry i was given this address
im looking for a mr he checks the scrap of paper
a mr dzikiewicz
nodding michal dzikiewicz

szpilman sits down slowly
i need help
hell be back before curfew

he gazes at her
she looks away
how long have you been married

this is not a good time to have children
the door opens and michal dzikiewicz enters
he sees szpilman and stops
this is my husband
marek gebczynski sent him
he shakes hands with szpilman
mr gebczynski said to contact you only in an emergency but
dont worry now
we cant move you tonight
szpilman dizzy leans on the table for support
youll sleep on the sofa
he and dorota look at him
excuse me could i have a piece of bread
yes of course well eat
szpilman asleep on the sofa
the sound of a cello
he opens his eyes
he swings his legs off the sofa stands and crosses to a door
quietly he opens it a little
szpilman and his pov another room
dorota partially turned away from him plays bach on the cello
szpilman watches her and listens
a padlock being unlocked
then a key is inserted into the yale lock turned and the door opens
michal and szpilman on the landing enter the flat
a large room sparsely furnished but with an upright piano and a bed
michal carries a bag of provisions and puts them on a table while szpilman goes immediately to the window and looks out
there are views of the city but in the street below opposite is a hospital and on the corner a building flying a nazi flag and guarded by a sentry
standing at his sentry box
michal comes up behind szpilman
in whisper youre in a very german area
the building opposite is a hospital taking in wounded from the russian front
next door is the schutzpolizei
its the safest place to be
right in the centre of the lions den
michal makes for the door
ill be locking you in
no one knows youre here
so keep as quiet as possible
he nods and goes
the sound of the padlock closing
szpilman takes in the room
he sees the piano is still for a moment then goes to it
he sits on the piano stool and adjusts its height
he opens the lid
a cloth covers the keys
he removes the cloth
he gazes lovingly at the keyboard
he flexes his fingers
then without touching the keys his fingers floating just above them he plays
szpilman alert hearing the padlock being unlocked and then iheydle
the door opens and michal enters accompanied by a man aged about thirty szalas confident a little brash
in whispers all well
this is antek szalas
szalas and szpilman shake hands
hes going to look after you
ive given him a second key
hell bring you food
see that youre all right
hes with the underground a good man
szalas produces a quarter bottle of vodka thumps the back of the bottle so that the cork flies out
he finds glasses and pours
while he does all this you dont remember me mr
no i dont think so
i was a technician
i saw you almost every day
sorry i dont remember
youve nothing to worry about
ill visit often
and youll be pleased to hear the allies are bombing germany night after night cologne hamburg berlin
and the russians are really giving them hell
its the beginning of the end
he gives the others their vodka
lets hope so
i dont know when ill see you again
they clink glasses and drink
trees in leaf
comings and goings at the schutzpolizei building
and an ambulance draws up at the hospital disgorging a couple of stretcher cases who are carried inside
very weak and his skin yellowish drops four beans into boiling water
the sound of the padlock being opened
szpilman hurries to see the door open and szalas enter with a small and grinning cheerfully
in whispers still alive then are you
he hands over the package
you still got that vodka
szpilman stares at the package
how long is this meant to last
szalas shrugs finds the vodka pours two glasses think ive got jaundice
he unwraps the package to reveal sausage and bread
he takes a bite of sausage chewing deliberately slowly
you dont want to worry about that
my grandfather was jilted by his girl friend when he got jaundice
in my opinion jaundice is not very serious
why didnt you come sooner
its been over two weeks
szalas goes to the window looks out
ive got to raise money to buy the food
i need things to sell it s not easy
szpilman thinks for a moment then takes off his wristwatch hands it to szalas
foods more important than time
szalas pockets the watch makes for the door stops
i meant to tell you
the allies have landed in france
the russiansll be here soon
theyll beat the shit out of the germans
any day now
he grins downs szpilmans vodka gives a mock salute and goes
hie padlock is locked on the other side
szpilman enjoys his sausage
sunshine floods in through the windows
szpilman lies inert on the bed weak starving ill
the sound of the padlock
he doesnt stir
dorota no longer pregnant and michal enter come to the bed
in whispers wladek
to michal i knew it i knew this would happen
szpilman barely has strength to open his eyes and focus on them
he mutters incoherently
im going to get a doctor
you cant its too dangerous
ill get dr luczak we can trust him
dorota dont be ridiculous hes a pediatrician
hes still a doctor
she starts for the door
no you stay ill go
the padlock sound
dorota goes to the kitchen wets a towel comes back to the bed kneels it places the towel on szpilmans brow
he focuses on her smiles
we came to say goodbye
were going to stay with my mother in otwock
the babys already there
theres talk that the uprising will begin any day now
szpilman suddenly winces with pain
that man szalas should be shot
hes been collecting money on your behalf all over warsaw
apparently people gave generously
so he collected a tidy sum
he told us he was visiting you daily
she looks at him barely audible
later szpilman looks up at dr luczak who has a stethoscope in his ears
dorota and michal stand behind him
acute inflammation of the gall bladder
liver the size of a football
but hell live
ill try to get hold of some levulose but its not easy
can you visit him again
doctor thank you
the doctor and michal leave his line of vision
dorota moves in beside him
michal brought food
ill prepare something now for you then we must go
szpilman tries again to say something but he cant just lies there distressed
szpilman looking down from the fourth floor window
a few pedestrians
an everyday atmosphere
at the far end at the t junction with a main road a tram rumbles down the street and comes to a halt disgorging passengers on the far side and
so out of sight
the tram continues on its way now revealing the few passengers who alighted women an old man with a stick
last three young poles carrying long objects wrapped in newspaper
one of the men looks at his watch glances around then suddenly kneels and puts the package hes carrying to his shoulder
the sound of rapid firing which makes the newspaper at the end of the packet glow to reveal the barrel of a machine gun
his two companions have also put their packages to their shoulders and begin shooting all aiming their fire at the schutzpolizei building
the sentry is hit and falls in front of his box
as if these young men have given a signal now from all over the city comes the sound of gunfire
the pedestrians have scattered except for the old man gasping for breath hobbling on his walking stick who eventually manages to disappear inside a building
rifle and machine gun fire from the schutzpolizei building
the firing intense
the three young poles manoeuvre to the corner opposite the schutzpolizei and toss grenades into the building
a battle raging
the germans firing from the hospital
the three young poles have been joined by other fighters and they the schutzpolizei building
grenades thrown machine gun fire exchanged
the sentry box blows up splinters of wood cascading
a couple of poles make a dash for it and enter a building opposite to the schutzpolizei
szpilman watching from his window looks in the opposite direction and sees smoke rising
when he turns back to look towards the t junction he sees a panzerfaust anti tank rocket firer poking out from a window in the next door building but on
the floor below
the panzerfaust fires
the shell hits the hospital
the city in flames
sound of firing becoming sporadic less intense
szpilman lying on the bed staring at the ceiling
the interior of the schutzpolizei building burnt to cinders
an ambulance is being loaded with patients from the hospital
a horse drawn cab rounds a corner and clatters down the street
szpilman at the window watching
the horse drawn cab clatters out of his sight
he is about to draw back when he sees directly beneath him a man and woman walking with their hands in the air
then a german soldier pointing his rifle at their backs appears
suddenly the man and woman begin to run
the man turns and disappears
the woman also turns but the german soldier drops to one knee and fires
the woman clutches her stomach drops slowly to her knees and collapses on the street in an awkward kneeling position and thats how she remains
szpilman watches aghast
then he hears voices outside his door shouts footsteps panic
he runs to his front door and listens
just get out
get out into the street
more clatter of footsteps
then get out now
the germans have surrounded the building
theyre going to blow us to pieces
footsteps descending stairs more shouts and further off everyone out please
leave your flats at once please
szpilman runs to the door tries it but its padlocked and he cant open the door
in panic he runs back to the window
his eyes grow wide with terror
a german tank bringing its gun to bear on the building next to his
the gun jerks back and theres a great roaring noise
the whole building shakes
szpilman reek back falls gets to his feet and crawls back to the window
he sees the tank turret swivelling slowly bringing the gun to bear directly on a lower floor of his building
the roaring noise again
a terrific explosion
his windows are shattered
he is thrown back across the room
smoke begins to billow and fill the room
smoke filling the room
szpilman gets to his knees peers through the smoke and sees that the wall separating his apartment from the one next door has been partially destroyed with a large hole
blasted in it
he stumbles into the next door apartment and out of the front door
szpilman staggers up to the fifth floor landing
theres a metal attic door
szpilman pushes open the door and steps into the attic
the roof space with laundry drying on lines
szpilman enters the attic closes the door leans on it
fourth floor fischke
he looks round sees that the roof has been shattered leaving a large jagged gap
he climbs through the gap on to the roof at the back of the building
the attic door being kicked in by a german boot
a german soldier wearing his gas mask bayonet fixed enters the attic looks round sees nothing then at the double fischke
the soldier turns and hurries out
on the sloping roof szpilman clutches the skylight and has his feet in the roof gutter
he listens all quiet in the house
and then a bullet ricochets off the tiles beside him
szpilman terrified drops involuntarily catching a lower edge so that his feet dangle above a balcony below
he drops on to the balcony and looks back
two german soldiers are firing at szpilman
szpilman clambers back into the building through the smashed balcony door
a couple of shots dangerously close
szpilman staggers down the stairs stumbles over a corpse and almost falls headlong
the sun is setting
szpilman crawls into the backyard
he hears german voices shouting commands
he hides behind three garbage bins by the wall
buildings on fire but dying out
corpses in the street including the woman who was shot still in her strange kneeling position
szpilman watches from the doorway
then dropping down he crawls across the road on his stomach threading his way through the dead bodies now besieged by flies and makes for the hospital opposite
german soldiers appear from around a corner
szpilman immediately lies still pretending to be just another corpse
flies alight on him
when the germans pass he sets off again
szpilman crawls into a corner rests
he tries to take stock of his surroundings
he can make out the operating table
he manages to drag himself on to it
he lies there his eyes grow heavy
german soldiers dragging the corpses into a pile
a sergeant douses the bodies in petrol then sets them alight
the bodies burn
from a shattered window on the first floor he looks at the burning bodies
two german soldiers wander into his eyeline
he draws back a little but watches them warily
they sit just beneath him chatting and take out their food tins drink coffee and eat bread
szpilman wanders down the passage sees into the wards the empty beds the broken furniture and medical equipment
szpilman opens cupboards drawers searching but trying to be as quiet as possible
he sees the refrigerator quickly gets to it pulls open the door
he looks around and notices a red fire bucket with a spade and a box of sand next to it
the bucket is full of water covered with an iridescent film and full of dead flies
he drinks as much water as he can without swallowing the flies and while hes doing so he spots a couple of sacks
he opens the first potatoes
the second contains barley
he tries to eat the uncooked barley but cant
later a fire on the floor
szpilman holds a saucepan over it and is cooking the barley and some potatoes
he manages to scoop out a spoonful blows to cool it then eats
szpilman at a window sees autumn leaves thick on the ground
and at the end of the street a line of poles some with their hands in the air others with hands on heads being marched away by german soldiers
szpilman lies in bed under several layers of blankets
ice on the windows
he hears german voices shouting commands
he sits up
szpilman gets to a window and looks out
german soldiers with flame throwers are burning the buildings opposite
one soldier with a bucket of white paint and a brush numbers the building
szpilman cranes to see them reach the end of the street then cross over and start on the buildings on his side working their way towards the hospital
he pulls away and makes for the back of the hospital
szpilman goes to a window jumps out
he twists his ankle
hes in pain
he crawls across the back garden and climbs over the wall
devastation not a human being in sight
he is alone
szpilman hobbles away
cautiously szpilman limps towards the villa a once grand building but now partly damaged by shell fire
he makes his way in
szpilman enters the hall still showing signs of its former opulence
he looks round anxiously then sees the stairs leading down to the basement
he hurries towards them and descends
szpilman comes down a flight of wooden stairs that had directly into the kitchen
immediately he begins to search fractically opening cupboards drawers
he finds a can with a label illustrating pickled cucumbers
desperately he searches for something to open it with
he discovers a pair of scales with a variety of weights
he seizes one of the weights when very close he hears the sound of a car coming to a halt then the car door slam a german voice giving commands
he drops the weight but holding the tin he scampers up the stairs
szpilman clutching the unopened tin makes his way up the narrow wooden staircase
szpilman panting heavily reaches the top floor
he sees a small door tries it
szpilman enters closing the small door behind him
he leans back resting recovering
and then he hears from down below a piano playing a beethoven piece
after a few bars the music stops
szpilman listens anxiously
he looks around finding himself in an attic space filled with junk a ladder rotting material travelling trunks
last light of day filtering through a dormer window
theres a ladder leading up to a trapdoor
szpilman climbs the ladder
he crawls into a small empty space
with enormous effort he pulls up the ladder and closes the trapdoor
exhausted and trying to catch his breath he gazes at the unopened tin
he peers through the darkness but sees nothing
his eyes begin to droop
fires glow on the horizon
szpilman wakes suddenly
silence but for the distant gunfire
he sees the unopened tin of pickles stares at it
he opens the trapdoor
szpilman a shadow a spectre creeps down the stairs
szpilman has placed the tin and the weight on a shelf and is engrossed in searching again
he finds a pair of chicken scissors
using the weight he starts to hammer the point of the scissors into the tin making a perforation round the rim
the tin slips off the shelf and rolls across the floor coming to rest at a pair of highly polished jackboots
szpilman stifles a gasp
on the stairs in silhouette gazing down at him the figure of a german captain the thumb of one hand caught in his belt above his pistol
stern who the hell are you
szpilman just stares at him
who are you
what the hell are you doing
barely audible in german i was
i was trying to open this tin
where do you live
whats your work
i was a pianist
he studies szpilman for a moment then with a nod orders him to follow
szpilman picks up the tin and follows
szpilman follows the german captain through a double door hanging off its hinges into a room with a broken table in the centre what once was the dining room
and then through another set of doors
the german captains boots echo
they come into a spacious room
faint moonlight filters through the large windows
fallen masonry and broken glass
a couple of chairs
and a grand piano in the corner
the german captain points at the piano
szpilman hesitates then limps to the piano puts down the tin and opens the lid
he turns and drags one of the chairs over and sits
the german captain stands and watches
szpilman glances surreptitiously at his hands and then he plays chopin
the german captain listens expressionless
the pale moonlight shows him to be a handsome elegant man
szpilman finishes playing
somewhere a cat mews
distant burst of rifle fire
the german captain stares at szpilman
after a moment are you hiding here
szpilman just stares at him
where are you hiding
in german in the attic
szpilman hesitates takes the tin and then shuffles past the german captain towards the door
szpilman and the german captain enter
the german captain takes out a flashlight sees the ladder in place leading up to the loft
szpilman climbs the ladder squeezes into the loft and looks down at the german captain who shines his light on him
have you anything to eat
szpilman shows him the tin
ill bring you something
he goes quickly leaving szpilman in darkness
szpilman overcome by relief can barely catch his breath
the german captain strides out of the villa down the front steps to a waiting car and a driver
he gets into the car
the driver starts the engine and the car speeds off into the night
szpilman hears the cars engine growing fainter
he starts to tremble and then begins to cry
he weeps uncontrollably
much activity officers coming and going orderlies typing
officers king on field telephones
desks filing cabinets
the german captain carrying a bulging shoulder bag marches into a room just off the hall and goes to his desk just as an orderly drops papers in his in
on the desk theres a framed photograph of him nth a woman and two children
german captain glances at the papers takes a pen initials one or two and then goes
the german captain marches up the stairs purposefully as if hes on urgent business
the german captain enters
he puts two fingers in his mouth and whistles
after a moment the trapdoor shifts and szpilman looks down
the german captain takes a package from his shoulder bag and throws it up into the loft
he turns to go
the german captain stops
whats all that gunfire
on the other side of the river
turns to leave stops with a touch of irony all you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks
he goes quickly
szpilman opens the package finds bread and marmalade
then he finds a tin opener
the sound of distant gunfire
the germans are evacuating the villa
men carry out boxes filing cabinets desks papers and load them into trucks
theyre careless leaving a trail of debris
no sentries now
szpilman listening and shivering with cold
he hears the whistle
he opens the trapdoor to see the german captain in the attic carrying a package
were getting out
szpilman faces the german captain
in german are the russians here
he hands szpilman the package
szpilman opens it to find inside several loaves of bread
i dont know how to thank you
dont thank me
its his will that we should survive
thats what we have to believe
szpilman shivers with cold
the german captain takes off his coat and gives it to him
what about you
ive got another one
brief pause what will you do when its all over
ill play the piano again
on polish radio
tell me your name
ill listen out for you
a crooked smile good name for a pianist
then the sound of recorded music as a car with a loudspeaker and a polish national flag comes into view the polish national anthem blaring out from the speaker
szpilman wearing the german captains coat and under the eiderdown hears the strange sound of the music which he recognises
hes astonished puzzled
he comes to a decision and starts to leave
cautiously in his german military overcoat szpilman trots down the staircase into the empty hall
he goes to the front door opens it a crack and cautiously goes out
szpilman looks around hearing the car loudspeaker indistinctly
polish soil liberated
his excitement grows and he walks out into the street
he sees at one end soldiers serving soup from afield kitchen to a group of people
on the opposite side of the street he sees a man and a woman who have left the field kitchen
the man carries a two tiered canister
szpilman rushes towards them grabs hold of the man and tries to kiss him
the man totally bewildered tries to fight him off
the woman is terrified
she runs yelling towards the field kitchen
so does the man
szpilman stands and stares then sees one of the soldiers cock his rifle and fire at him
szpilman runs the firing continuing
szpilman bolts into the doorway of a ruined building
he peers out to see polish soldiers beginning to surround the ruined building firing shots lobbing in a grenade or two
shouting stop for gods sake i beg you im polish
more shots and another grenade explosion
the polish soldiers two of the officers stand near the entrance hearing szpilmans shouts
yelling come out with your hands up
obeying dont shoot
yes hes polish
as szpilman approaches why the fucking coat
the polish officers confer briefly in whispers
then take him to headquarters
and they march him off
a column of men and women stretching along the length of the lane
a couple of horse and carts
one or two bicycles
some of the people wear concentration camp garb others in tattered clothing
four men walk together and when they come to a narrow junction stop seeing something behind barbed wire german prisoners of war guarded by russian soldiers
no shelters no tents
the pows sit or lie on the ground silent broken shattered
the four men gaze at them
look at them bastards
i prayed for this never thought id see it
the fourth man zygmunt lednicki approaches the barbed wire
look at you now
you took everything i had
me a musician
wagging his finger fiercely you took my violin
you took my soul
he stands glowering at them then sees a pow rise from a group wretched shabby unshaven
its the german captain uniform tattered a wreck
he comes to the barbed wire
urgent in german do you happen to know another musician a mr szpilman
yes of course i know szpilman
desperate i helped mr szpilman when he was in hiding
tell him im here
ask him to help me
a russian guard inside the compound approaches grabs hold of the german captain
to lednicki in russian hey
no talking to the prisoners
get away from there
he drags the german captain away from the wire
as he backs away calling whats your name
the german captain is being bundled away by the guard who aims a kick at him
the german captain shouts out his name but its unintelligible
the german captain and the guard have disappeared
lednicki stands for a moment then turns and goes
szpilman playing the piano
he looks something like his former self fairly well dressed and groomed
he glances towards the glass booth and sees lednicki with the technicians
lednicki nods smiles back
szpilman and lednicki looking around an empty field
it was here im certain of it
its not here now
i shouted abuse at them im not proud of it but thats what i did and im certain i stood where you are now
there was barbed wire and this german came up to me
you didnt catch his name
ill ask at the factory
they may know something
szpilman stands looking around the empty field
he is filled with sadness
he closes his eyes and put his face to the sun
szpilman plays chopins piano concerto no with full orchestra and conductor
he plays superbly
the music is glorious
