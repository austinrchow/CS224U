screenplay by frank darabont from the novel by stephen king first draft we each owe a death there are no exceptions
a song begins distant as a faded memory on an old victrola once i built a railroad made it run
made it race against time
once i built a railroad now its done
brother can you spare a dime
opening credit sequence plays against footage of the great depression images haunting and sepia toned defining an era
the bread lines
the soup kitchens
the dust bowl refugees heading west with their possessions on their backs and no hope in their eyes
the strutting gangster royalty flaunting their bootleg riches
an entire generation of lost youth riding the rials
army troops raining truncheon blows on the half starved and forgotten veterans of world war one as hooverville is set afire in the very shadow of the nations capitol
all these faces all these lives in a world not really so very long ago
where cattails sway in the sepia toned heat
a small scrap of fabric is snagged in the nettles fluttering languidly
color bleeds slowly in as mosquitoes swarm and dragonflies skitter showing the fabric scrap to be pale yellow
suddenly a man with a shotgun comes crashing through the cattails wiping through frame and exiting
then another man
armed with rifles plowing through the brush exiting frame
and now comes klaus detterick a farmer one step above shirt tail poor a double barrel shotgun in the crook of his arm
he pauses horrified seeing the scrap of cloth
he pulls it loose turns back screaming something in anguish
and still more men come crashing into view flooding by us with dreamlike slow motion grace
one man is leading a team of dogs trying to untangle the leads
deputy rob mcgee is shouting for everybody to stay together
and under it all we hear a sibilant frightening whisper you love your sister
you make any noise know what happens
and off that horrible voice we a clock radio spews the morning weather report abruptly pulling us into the present with a prediction of rain
paul edgecomb late s early s wakes to another day
paul stands at his bathroom mirror meticulously buttoning his shirt
he picks up a hairbrush starts tidying his hair
the old and infirm haunt these corridors like ghosts
a woman inches along on a walker
a man shuffles by with a rolling i
the floor is a limey institutional green
paul comes into view spry for his age murmurs an occasional greeting
dozens of retirees are having breakfast sipping weak coffee or tea
some chat and gossip other are content to keep their own company some just stare slackly into space
paul enters sees elaine connelly sitting with a few other ladies sipping tea
shes refined and elegant his best friend here
she gives him a good morning smile
he gives her a rakish wink in return which makes her smiles all the more
paul reaches past the people at the counter and sneaks two pieces of cold leftover toast off a serving plate
he tosses elaine another look catch ya later and exits
paul slips to the back door unnoticed
identical red plastic rain ponchos line the wall on pegs
he helps himself to one and eases outside making good his escape
nestled in a valley of wooded hills a drizzly mist rolling over the treetops
paul appears f
coming up the ridge in his borrowed poncho
he looks back at the valley below inhales deeply this is a man who loves his walks
he pulls a piece of toast from his pocket and starts to nibble as he presses up on the ridge
low angle nursing home and ridge beyond and we see paul from a distance just a speck trudging up toward the treeline
a pickup truck rumbles into frame and parks a bumper sticker looming large i have seen god and his name is newt gingrich
brad dolan gets out an orderly in his late s early s arriving for work in jeans and cheesy plaid shirt
he gazes up toward the ridge scowling and muttering softly old fuck
he slams the door and heads for the nursing home
as camera booms down through the trees to find paul wandering a wooded path munching a tidbit of toast looking for all the world like red riding hood in his
its silent here like a church
the only sounds we hear are the twittering of the birds and the hammering of the woodpecker
a rustling sound makes paul freeze
he turns becomes transfixed
softly oh my
reverse angle reveals a magnificent buck not twenty feet away misty breath punching the cold morning air
they watch each other for an endless moment both standing stock still
and then the animal bounds away vanishing into the foliage
paul lets out a breath shakes his head in wonder
he takes another bite of toast moves on
and we pan with him to reveal a pair of old wooden storage shacks along the path up ahead
dark in here cobwebby and decrepit
we see paul approaching outside the grimy window
he steps up to the glass and shades his eyes peering curiously in as we paul approaches the back door returning from his walk
he reaches for the knob
and a figure in white lunges from behind the dumpster to grab his wrist
he whirls gasping in fright its brad dolan wearing his orderlys uniform
out for a little stroll paulie
paul tries to pull away but dolans got him tight
whats with this poncho you got on huh
this isnt yours
i got it off the wall there
theres a whole row of them
but not for you paulie thats the thing
those are for the staff
i just borrowed it
dont see what harm it does
its not about harm its about rules
you probably dont think an old fart like you has to mind rules anymore but thats just not true
brads eyes keep shifting he obviously doesnt mind abusing the elderly as long as he doesnt get caught doing it
im sorry if i broke the rules
you got no business up in those woods anyway especially in the rain
what if you fall and bust a hip huh
who you thinks gonna have to hoss your sorry old bacon back down here
me thats who
youre hurting me
what do you do up there anyway
youre too old to go jerk off so what do you do
i just walk thats all i like to walk
brad lashes out and grabs pauls other hand which hes been holding tightly clenched shut
let poppa see
paul uncurls his fingers revealing the crushed remnants of a bit of toast his palm slick with a greasy oleo smear
elaine stands just inside the screen door with a cup of tea
brads eyes become calculated wondering how much shes seen
elaine keeps her tone level betraying nothing i saw you coming back thought youd like some tea
beat are you coming in
dolan and i were
about the weather
i think were through now
brad lets paul loose leans close paulie
you tell anyone i squeezed your po ol hand ill tell em youre having senile delusions
who you think theyll believe
brad walks off
paul turns watches him go
the screen door opens and elaine steps out her face pale
paul gives her a strained though grateful smile as we jerry springers on the tube whipping his studio audience into a frenzy
pan off to reveal dozens of old folks watching on couches and folding chairs
an old black fellow named pete is grousing to a group of elderly ladies
why we always watch this crap
buncha inbred trailer trash all they ever talk about is fucking
and we continue panning to paul and elaine sitting near the back talking quietly as paul rubs his bruised hand we should report him
that might just provoke him all the more make things worse for everybody
its not everybody he has it in for paul
off his look what did you do to provoke him in the first place
hes just an abusive bully and should be made to stop
pete is at the tv switching channels while no the movie classic channel is further down
past the home shopping
he finds the movie classic channel which is playing an old black and white musical top hat with fred astaire and ginger rogers
a delighted reaction oh
this is wonderful
paul idly shifts his gaze to the tv
and his expression goes slack with recognition and dismay
elaine sees the look in his eyes
he glances away
even briefly considers walking out
but in the end he cant help himself
the past just caught up with him with a freight train wallop and for one he decides to ride the rails
he looks back at the tv
on screen fred and ginger have begun their famous cheek to cheek number with astaire singing in that sublime easy go lucky way of his heaven im in heaven
and my heart beat so that i can hardly speak
slow push in on paul watching
hed like to take his eyes off the screen but the movie has him in a grip tighter than brad dolans
elaine is watching him with puzzled concern paul
what is it
all he can hear is that music all he can see are those dancers
the figures on tv are gliding with ghostlike grace in their silvery phosphor dot world of long ago
paul abruptly bursts into tears
the room goes quiet everything comes to a standstill
all eyes turn some concerned others merely curious
paul just sits sobbing into his hands shoulders heaving
rushing over what is it
ill be okay
another orderly appears brad dolan
he puts his hand on pauls shoulder and leans close feigning concern
why the boo hoo hoo
something nasty happen
elaine shoves his hand away eyes flashing with anger
edgecomb will be perfectly fine without your help thank you
brad back off with a hey suit yourself gesture
elaine helps paul to his feet and leads him out
paul is staring out the windows pensive and drained
its raining now pattering the glass and the lawn beyond
elaine waits across from him wishing he would speak
softly i guess sometimes the past just catches up with you whether you want it to or not
was it the film
off his look it was wasnt it
i havent spoken of these things in a long time ellie
over sixty years
she reaches out gently takes his hand
im your friend
yes you are
paul wonders if hes even up to talking about it after all this time
and decides that perhaps he is i ever tell you i was a prison guard during the depression
youve mentioned it
did i mention i was in charge of death row
that i supervised all the executions
this does come as a surprise
she shakes her head
they usually call death row the last mile but we called ours the green mile because the floor was the color of faded limes
we had the electric chair then
old sparky we called it
beat ive lived a lot of years ellie but takes the prize
that was the year i had the worst urinary infection of my life
that was also the year of john coffey and the two dead girls
in blackness a title card appears the two dead girls hundreds of prisoners work the fields pickaxes rising and falling in waves a prison song being sung in cadence with
guards patrol on horseback rifles aimed at the sky
a late s ford prison truck comes chugging into view along the road kicking up a long trail of dust in the heat
it seems to be riding unusually low on its rear suspension
a depression era prison in the south
the prison truck sways down the rutted dirt road toward the main gate
while paul edgecomb early s stands in a cramped toilet in his guards uniform trying to piss
his face is pained his forehead beaded with sweat
brutus howell nicknamed brutal for his intimidating size but hes actually rather thoughtful by nature stands at the entry door of the cellblock peering out through a viewing slot
he sees the prison truck arrive at the main gate
he turns and nods to fellow guard dean stanton sitting at the duty desk then cross the green mile a wide corridor of faded green linoleum running some sixty paces
top to bottom with four large cells to a side
brutal steps to the bathroom listen a moment knocks softly
gimme a minute
brutal waits patiently a bit embarrassed
he finally hears a thin trickle accompanied by a stifled groan of pain
you all right in there
for a man pissing razor blades
the door opens revealing pauls pale and sweaty face
you shoulda took the day off gone to see the doctor
with a new arrival
you know better
besides its not as bad as it was
i think its clearing up
they hear the truck honking as it rumbles up outside
paul gives them a nod to resume their positions
paul walks down the mile passing the cells where two inmates reside the first is arlen bitterbuck a washita cherokee the second is eduard delacroix del a skinny cajun
new boy coming in boss
never you mind del you just keep your nose quietly on your business
paul arrives at the end of the mile takes up a position at an empty cell
down at this end past the cells is e blocks version of the hole a padded room where violent inmates are sent to cool off
it isnt used very often
in fact at the moment its doubling as storage space
brutal peers out the viewing slot as the truck stops outside
damn theyre riding on the axle
whatd they do bust the springs
guards percy wetmore and harry terwilliger of e block emerge from the back of the truck and step down turn back
tighter angle on back of truck we get our first glimpse of the new inmate as a pair of gigantic black feet step down into the yard
and the rear of the truck bounces back up on its springs where it belongs
brutal sees whats coming eyes widening slightly
you might wanna reconsider getting in the cell with this guy
cant be bigger than you
brutal tosses him a look just wait
he swings the door open in a hot flood of daylight giving us our first good look at john coffey is a huge black man nearly feet tall and pounds
his massive head shiny and bald his skin a tapestry of old scars his prison overalls the biggest size they had ending at mid calf
he looks dull and confused as if wondering where he is and how he got there
percy and harry lead him toward e block in shackles
percys got his hickory baton out of it custom made holster hollering dead man walking
dead man walking here
inside the cellblock paul cant see them approach from where he stands but he can certainly hear percy jeezus pleeze us what the hells he yelling about
up by the door brutal just rolls his eyes
percy is the first one through the door still hollering
dead man walking
then coffey enters ducking low to get through his shadow blotting out brutal and dean as his massive frame fills the door
everything hangs suspended for a moment a look of hold shit written on everybodys faces
percy keeps yanking on the big mans cuffs leading him along with a cry of dead man walking
dead man percy thats enough
percy falls reproachfully silent
paul doesnt dignify it just motions for them to come on
the procession comes down the mile with brutal and dean bringing up rear
you sure you wanna be in there with him
looks to coffey am i gonna have trouble with you big boy
coffey shakes his head slowly
paul takes the clipboard transfer papers from harry turns and enters the cell
coffey just stands outside the cell and waits as if he doesnt understand the concept
paul motions him to come on in
coffey starts to comply but percy raps him smartly with the tip of his hickory baton to get him moving faster
coffey flinches enters the cell
paul stares angrily at percy who stands slapping his hickory baton against the palm of his hand like a man with a toy hes itching to use
theyre moving house over in the infirmary
why dont you go see if they could use some help
they got all the men they need
why dont you just go make sure
off his look i dont care where you go percy as long as its not here at this very moment
percy flushes red the baton hovering near his palm
he looks like hes about to say something but thinks better of it and stalks angrily up the mile instead
and sees del at his bars smiling
infuriated percy swings his baton and smashes dels fingers with a loud crack
del jerks back howling in pain wiped that grin off your shitpoke face didnt i goddamn it percy
get the hell off my block
percy throws paul a look of disdain your block huh
he swaggers out
dels on his knees weeping from the pain oww damn boss he done bus my fingers for true
well get it looked at del now keep yourself quiet like i said
del falls silent moaning over his hand
paul turns to coffey who looks unsettled by all the commotion
if i let harry take those chains off you you gonna be nice
harry enters to remove coffeys shackles
your name is john coffey
deep and quiet yes sir boss like the drink only not spelt the same
so you can spell can you
coffey shakes his head
harry steps out
my name is paul edgecomb
if im not here you can ask for mr
howell or mr
those gentlemen there
beat this isnt like the rest of the prison
its a quiet place we like to keep it that way
coffey considers this carefully puzzled
it werent me making all the noise boss
eyes narrowing you having a joke on me john coffey
paul sees he isnt joking continues your time here can be easy or hard depends on you
if you behave you get to walk in the exercise yard every day
we might even play some music on the radio from time to time
coffey doesnt miss a beat as if hes been waiting to ask do you leave a light on after bedtime
its the last thing he expected
coffey smiles uneasily as if they might think him foolish for asking
because i get a little scared in the dark sometimes
if its a strange place
paul looks to his men
the guards are trading glances
its pretty bright in here all night long
we keep half the lights burning in the corridor
coffey looks confused
paul points to the lights lining the ceiling of the green mile in wire mesh cages
right out there
coffey nods relieved
then he surprises everybody by offering paul his hand as if to show proper manners
paul hesitates oddly touched then surprised his men even more by accepting
coffeys hand swallows his
coffey shakes gently lets go
paul steps from the cell
brutal slides the door shut locks it
coffey stands a moment as if unsure what to do then sinks onto the cot with his hands clasped between his knees
he looks up at paul his voice soft as a whisper couldnt help it boss
i tried to take it back but it was too late
paul turns leads his men up the mile
and they enter a few moments later
paul is furious but keeping a lid on his temper dean run delacroix up to the infirmary and see if his fingers are broken
course theyre broken i heard the damn bones crack
you hear what he was yelling when we brought the big dummy in
how could i miss it harry
the whole prison heard
this makes brutal snort breaking the tension the others cant help smiling
youll probably have to answer for sending him off the mile
hes gonna cause you trouble over this you mark me
ill chew that food when i have to
right now i wanna hear about the new inmate
aside from how big he is okay
smiles monstrous big
seems meek enough
looks like they sent us an imbecile to execute
imbecile or not he deserves to fry for what he done
harry tosses a pair of manila envelopes bound with rubber bands on the desk before paul coffeys file
make your blood curdle
a small are reserved for inmates of the mile fenced off from the main prison yard
arlen bitterbuck walks the perimeter under the watchful eyes of guard bill dodge
we find paul sitting by himself on the bleachers with coffeys file on his knees thoughtfully unwrapping his brown bagged sandwich
push slowly in as he begins to read
and we see klaus detterick walk from his house to the barn with a milking pail a solitary figure against a brightening horizon
he disappears into the barn
and we hold for a long moment the house silent b
chickens clucking and scratching in the front yard
until a womans scream shatters the silence
klaus reappears dropping the pail running toward the house
as paul turns the page keeps reading
and klaus bursts in to find his wife marjorie absolutely frantic with terror she drags him through the house to a screened off porch area where their year old son
howie is pointing and shouting papa
and klaus freezes there stunned to see blood spattered on the floor and the screen door hanging off its hinges
oh my god
as paul absently takes another bite of his sandwich not really tasting it keeps reading
plunging us back into the screaming chaos klaus grabbing up shotgun shells howie loading the
rifle he got for christmas marjorie sobbing incoherently
and she goes stumbling through the house grabbing for the phone as her men disappear toward the porch b
central are you on the line
oh god please somebody took my little girls
klaus and his son race from the house following spatters of blood across the yard
as paul lets out a long breath turns the page
and we see cars and trucks pulling up men jumping out with rifles pouring down the incline toward the field where klaus is hollering and waving his arms
deputy mcgee comes sliding down from the road taking charge at the top of his lungs mcgee and the dogs come bounding out of the back of a truck howling
down the incline to lead the chase
which takes us through the cattails and bulrushes
to the spot where klaus finds the little scrap of pale yellow fabric turns and screams
oh lord this belongs to my katie
and they keep going stopping abruptly as they find a blood drenched area of tramped grass
a little girls bloody nightgown hangs in the low branches of a tree
some of these strong men look like they might throw up or faint at the sight of it
their blood freezes in their veins as an inhuman howling commences up ahead
its like nothing theyve ever heard before raising the hackles of men and dogs alike
as paul quietly turns another page shaking his head
the men reload their weapons
mcgee starts off the other following his lead toward where they emerge from the treeline drawing ever closer to the source of that inhuman howling
and they stop gazing in horror john coffey sits on the riverbank in bloody overalls his huge feet splayed out before him
hes making that inhuman howling sound face twisted in monstrous grief pausing occasionally to take in a great hitching breath of air
curled in his massive arms are the naked bodies of dettericks year old twin girls their once blonde hair now matted to their heads with blood
the men staring
john coffey howling
a train puffing smoke across the landscape
klaus detterick breaks the moment lunging down the riverbank in a headlong rush
the others try to grab him but he shrugs them off and throws himself on coffey with a scream of inarticulate rage kicking and punching fists flying
coffey barely seems to notice
the others catch up with klaus drag him off
he falls to his knees on the riverbank sobbing into his hands
howie runs to him throws himself into his fathers arm
they hug each other tightly overwhelmed with grief
a semblance of quiet descends except for coffeys heartbroken wailing
a ring of rifle toting men forms around him though he hardly seems aware of it
mcgee steps forward uncertain mcgee mister
coffey goes quiet at once eyes still streaming tears
can you hear me
coffey nods you have a name
like the drink only not spelt the same
mcgee hunkers carefully down watching for any sudden moves
mcgee what happened here john coffey
you want to tell me that
i couldnt help it
i tried to take it back but it was too late
mcgee pause boy you are under arrest for murder
mcgee spits in coffeys face
as paul looks up with a slight start jarred from his reading to find warden hal moores standing before him
im just about done
paul stows the file as hal settles onto the bleachers
hows that pretty gal of yours
melindas not so well paul
not so well at all
got laid up with another headache yesterday
worst one yet
shes also developed this weakness in her right hand
doctor still think its migraines
hal gives a slight shake of his head
ill be taking her up to indianola next day or so for some tests
had x rays and the like
she is scared to death
truth to tell so am i
if its something they can see with an x ray maybe its something they can fix
he pulls a letter hands it to paul
this just came in
paul glances toward bitterbuck scans the letter nods
you didnt come all the way down here just to hand me a d
i had an angry call from the state capital about twenty minutes ago
is it true you ordered percy wetmore off the block
im sure you had reason but like it or not the wife of the governor of this state has only one nephew and his name happens to be percy wetmore
i need to tell you how this lays out
little percy called his aunt and squealed like a schoolroom sissy
hal nods he also mention he assaulted a prisoner this morning out of sheer petulance
broke three fingers on eduard delacroixs left hand
i didnt hear that part
im sure she didnt either
the man is mean careless and stupid
bad combination in a place like this
sooner or later hes gonna get somebody hurt
you and brutus howell will make sure that doesnt happen
easy enough to say
we cant watch him every minute hal
stick with it
may not be much longer
i have it on good authority that percy has an application in at briar ridge
the mental hospital
nods administration job
then whys he still here
he could get that application pushed through
hell with his connections he could have any state job he wants
hal has no answer
paul look off toward bitterbuck
tell you what i think
i think he just wants to see one cook up close
hal follows pauls gaze takes his meaning
well hell get his chance then wont he
maybe then hell be satisfied and move on
in the meantime youll keep the peace
thank you paul
hal rises slapping yard dust off his trousers
you give melinda my love okay
i bet that x ray turns out to be nothing at all
hal walks off looking like hes got the weight of the world on his shoulders
paul looks at the letter again
which is head date of execution
paul is at the kitchen table in the wee hours of the morning drinking buttermilk and listening to soft music on the radio
janice edgecomb appears shuffling sleepily downstairs
music too loud
theres just this big empty spot in the bed where my husband usually sleeps
he said to tell you hes having a little trouble with that tonight
she comes into the kitchen strokes his hair
theres an easy familiarity and a deep love between these two
worried about melinda and hal
is that whats got you up
she sits on his lap and gives him a crooked smile youre not getting off that easily
got a new inmate today
big simple minded fella
do i want to hear what he did
one sleepless member of this familys enough
softly the things that happen in this world
its a wonder god allows it
she gives him a tiny kiss above his left eyebrow in that special spot that makes him prickle
why dont you come to bed
ive got something to help you sleep and you can have all you want
dont i wish
ive still got something wrong with my waterworks i dont want to pass it on
you see doc sadler yet
no because hell want me to take sulfa tablets and ill spend the rest of the week puking in every corner of my office
itll run its course all by itself thank you very much for your concern
she kisses that spot above his eyebrow again
poor old guy
in tight angles copper plugs are cleaned switches are oiled circuits are tested
as maintenance is performed on old sparky by jack van hay and a small crew
paul is carefully sanding a connector plug
dean is waxing old sparkys wooden arms to a gleam
paul and dean pause thinking they hear a laugh drifting in from e block
and then brutal calls softly to them paul
paul and dean enter to find brutal trying not to wake the cons in their cells by laughing too loudly
they follows his gaze down the mile see nothing turn to him like hes crazy
i guess the legislature loosened those purse strings enough to hire on a new guard
off their looks look again
hes right there
paul and dean look again and this time they see it a tiny brown mouse is coming up the mile
it trots a short distance peers right and left as if checking the snoring inmates in their cells then makes another forward spurt
hes doing a cell check
this gets them all trying not to laugh
the mouse draws ever closer
dean starts to look worried
it aint normal for a mouse to come up on people that way
maybe its rabid
oh my christ
the big mouse expert
the mouse man
you see it foaming at the mouth mouse man
dubious i dont see its mouth at all
that does it paul and brutal burst out laughing
the mouse stops before them and peers up curling its tail primly around its paws as if to wait
the guards fall silent fascinated
bitterbuck stirs in his cell sits up to watch
brutal tears off a piece of his half eaten corned beef sandwich holds it delicately out with two fingers
the mouse rises up appraising the morsel with shiny black eyes
aw brutal no
well be hip deep in mice around here
to paul i just wanna see what hell do
in the interests of science like
brutal drops the scrap
the mouse grabs it and eats sitting up like a dog doing a trick
the mouse turns and scurries back down the mile vanishing under the restraint room door at the far end
dean throws paul an i told you so look
hes in the damn restraint room
you know hes gonna be chewing the padding out of walls and making himself a nice little nest
brutal give paul a sheepish look well
lets get the damn mouse
they stride grimly down the mile to the restraint room door men on a mission
coffeys awake now peering from his cot
saw me a mouse go by
it was a dream
go back to sleep
werent no dream
it was a mouse all right
cant put anything over on you
paul unlocks the door revealing a padded room filled with storage cleaning supplies buckets of paint mops and ladders you name it
brutal shrugs off his jacket
paul grabs a mop from a steel bucket hands it to dean
dean watch the door
he tries to get past you whack him
brutal or the mouse
har har mouse man
brutal and paul start doing the heavy lifting muscling an unused filing cabinet out the door
and they finally relay the last few heavy buckets of paint onto the mile
paul and brutal catch their breath scanning the empty restraint room
their eyes go glaringly to dean
you let him get past you
no i didnt i was here all the time
then where the hell is he
they move slowly into the room peering into every nook and cranny utterly mystified
brutal shakes his head
three grown men
outsmarted by a mouse
well bright side is all this commotion probably scared him off for good
yeah thats right
thats the last well see of him
the mouse on the mile a low static shot
green floor stretching before us
harry and bill dodge are at the desk b
doing paperwork and filing chores
percy is idling nearby whistling softly and combing his hair
and into this quiet shot deep in foreground creeps the mouse
he starts walking the mile as before
right toward percy
stares through his bars as the mouse goes by
keeps combing his hair unaware
sits quietly picking his nose in his cell
the mouse appears outside the bars cruising inexorably up the mile
del turns slowly watches the mouse go by
still grooming himself still unaware
keeps coming closer
angle up to bitterbuck peering through his bars watching him go by
keeps working that comb and freezes at the sound of a tiny squeak
his head swivels slowly
and theres the mouse
staring at him
that moment of eye contact reveals an enmity older than time itself
if mice have a natural enemy percy is it
you little son of a bitch
harry and bill glance up from their work
well ill be damned
there he is big as billy be frigged
i thought brutal was pulling my leg
thats a goddamn mouse
brute said he was in here last night begging for food came right up to the desk
give him some room percy see what he does
percy takes a few careful steps back eyes never leaving the mouse
percys hand starts easing toward the handle of his baton
the mouse comes up to the desk as before
brave little bastard gotta give him that
harry breaks off a small piece of cracker and drops it
the mouse picks it up starts to eat
percys hand inches ever closer to his baton
here lemme try
bill drops a piece of cracker
the mouse ignores it completely keeping its beady little eyes on harry
percys hand starts easing his baton from its holster
maybe hes full
grins maybe he knows youre just a floater
gotta be an e block regular to feed the e block mouse doncha know
harry drops another piece and sure enough the mouse starts to eat
harrys smile fades
he and bill trade a look
i was just kidding ab percy lets rip a bellowing war cry yaaaahhh
and launches his baton like a spear scaring the crap out of everyone
the mouse ducks yes actually ducks and the baton sail over his head close enough to ruffle its fur bouncing off the floor
apparently remembering a pressing engagement elsewhere the mouse takes off in a flash toward the restraint room
percy roars with frustration and takes off after it trying to squash it with his heavy work shoes leaping and stomping with great big galloping strides missing the mouse by
and thus is the green mile traversed with percy stomping and hollering like a spastic flamenco dancer the convicts yelling at their bars the mouse zigging and zagging like jim
thorpe heading for the endzone
the mouse wins zipping to safety under the restraint room door
percy pounds his fist against the door in frustration he fumbles with his keys unlocks the door yelling all the while paul and brutal are arriving for work they pause
hearing percys yells drifting from the windows
the regular cons in the yard are drifting curiously to the fence wondering if a riots brewing
paul and brutal take off running and rush in to find percy met your mouse
percys down at the far end rummaging wildly in the restraint room tossing shit out onto the mile
its in here somewhere
im gonna squish the little son of a bitch
he starts muscling the filing cabinet out the door kicking buckets out of his way
brutal calls out to him percy we already tried that what
i said paul stops brutal with a look dont you dare stop him
uh knock yourself out
hope you nail the bastard
paul crosses his arms and smiles leans back against the desk to wait
and percy hauls the last of the stuff out exhausted
he steps back in and looks around unable to believe theres no mouse cowering in the corner
paul and the men approach keeping straight faces navigating the crap in the corridor
aint in there huh
dont that beat the mousie band
percy keeps scanning the restraint room
the others all look to paul waiting for him to speak youre the boss
you want to think about what you were doing just now
turns glaring i know what i was doing
trying to get the mouse
you also scared the living crap out of me and bill
he cocks a thumb at the inmates in their cells
they arent in cradle school case you didnt notice
directed at paul although you treat them that way half the time
we dont scare em any more than we have to percy
theyre under enough strain as it is
men under strain can snap
thats why our job is talking not yelling
youll do better to think of this place like an intensive care ward in a hospital i think of it as a bucket of piss to drown rats in
scans their faces anybody doesnt like it can kiss my ass
hows that sit
brutal steps forward wanting to slug the little bastard
percy shies back but keeps his bravado up try it
youll be on the bread lines before the week is out
we all know who your connections are percy
steps close but you ever threaten a man on this block again were all gonna have a go
job be damned
get all this shit back in the restraint room
youre cluttering up my mile
they turn and walk away leaving percy as we a slow tracking shot of the green floor takes us past a tiny scrap of break
and then another
and then past a mousetrap primed with a scrap of bacon
and we keep following a long trail of bread scraps and mousetraps until we come to percy alone on the mile carefully laying the last mousetrap down
and he scoots back against the desk to wait crouched and holding his breath eyes riveted to the restraint room door for any sign of his furry nemesis
and camera booms slowly down off his face dipping down to floor level
where the mouse is revealed under the desk peering in the same direction as percy wondering what the hells so interesting down there
it hops further out to see
and the mouse enters frame hopping out a few more steps mouse and man staring in the same direction
a long beat
percy turns looks down at the mouse
the mouse turns looks up at percy
and all hell breaks loose again
they race the mile as before percy hollering and stomping all the way mousetraps snapping and flying up into frame as they go charging wildly past the cells
the mouse wins again
percy pauses furious
and sees coffey staring at him from his cell
saw me a mouse go by
percy loses it kicking and punching the restraint room door in a screaming rage as we paul appears at bitterbucks bars with a group of guards
your daughter and her family are here
bitterbuck steps from his cell
bill dodge escorts him off the block
the moment theyre gone lets move
i want at least two rehearsals before he gets back
bitterbuck is led in
his daughter rises
an awkward hesitation
and she touches his face kisses him
he takes her hands kisses them tries not to cry
the rest of the family is there son in law grandchildren cousins
they form around him murmuring hellos shaking hands
while toot toot takes bitterbucks place in the cell
hes a wiry and toothless old trusty crazy as a tick
he sits sittin down sittin down rehearsing now
he glances to paul okay hit it
arlen bitterbuck step forward
toot springs to his feet and steps from the cell
im steppin forward im steppin forward im steppin forward
toot turns shows the top of his head to dean

toot starts up the corridor ringed by guards

toot throws himself to his knees as soon as they enter im prayin im prayin im prayin

harry slaps toot upside the head to shut him up
as i was saying i dont believe they actually shake their dicks harry
be that as it may mr
bitterbuck is a christian so we got reverend schuster coming in
oh hes good
doesnt get em worked up
on your feet toot
youve prayed enough for one day
gettin to my feet walkin again walkin on the green mile
brutal is waiting for them gun drawn
percy peers out from behind the partition wall from the switch room
what do i do
watch and learn
paul motions percy behind the wall
percy sighs takes his spot next to jack van hay peers through the wire mesh as toot plops into old sparky wriggling his skinny ass to get comfy
sittin down sittin down takin a seat in old sparkys lap
paul and dean kneel to apply the ankle clamps
brutal steps in from the side pressing down on the condemned mans left arm to keep him in place until the ankle clamps are secure
harry moves in from the other side securing the right arm clamp
gettin clamped gettin clamped gettin ow shit watch the skin
paul signals ankles secure
brutal holsters his pistol applies the final clamp to the left arm
roll on one
van hay mimes turning the generator knob up whispering roll on one means i turn the generator up full
youll see the lights go brighter in half the prison
as brutal steps before the condemned and pronounces arlen bitterbuck you have been condemned to die by a jury of your peers sentence imposed by a judge in good standing
in this state
do you have anything to say before the sentence is carried out
i want a fried chicken dinner with gravy on the taters i want to shit in your hat and i got to have mae west sit on my face because
i am one horny motherfucker
brutal tries to hold on but its impossible he cracks up
everybody falls apart howling helplessly with laughter
even jack van hay is guffawing behind his partition
only paul is reining it in hes a little too pissed to go with it
he waits until the laughing fit starts to pass then shut up brutal
that goes for everybody
i want quiet in here
turns toot another remark like that ill have van hay roll on two for real
beat gently it was pretty funny
thats why i dont like it
tomorrow night were doing this for real
i dont want somebody remembering a stupid joke like that and getting going again
off their looks ever try not laughing in church once something funny gets stuck in your head
same goddamn thing
lets keep going
harry takes a black mask and snugs it down over toots head leaving only the crown of his head exposed
brutal takes a large sponge dips it in a steel bucket mimes soaking it
whats with the sponge
you soak it in brine get it good and wet
conducts the electricity directly to the brain fast like a bullet
you dont ever want to throw the switch on a man without that
as the sponge is placed atop toots head
harry now lowers the steel cap and brutal secures the straps
arlen bitterbuck electricity shall now be passed through your body until you are dead in accordance with the state law
god have mercy on your soul
to van hay roll on two
van hay mimes flipping the switch looks to percy and thats that
toot cant resist he starts bucking and flailing now im fryin
fryin like a done tom turkey
paul rolls his eyes at brutal
brutal shifts his gaze past him and nods look behind you
one of the witnesses showed up a day early
sitting on the door sill watching them with beady eyes is the mouse
paul turns back addresses the room all right lets go again and do it right this time
get that idiot out of the chair
brutal and harry start undoing toots clamps
everybody relaxes drifting from their positions
and the room is now quietly filling up with witnesses trickling in
people speak in whispers if at all
bitterbuck the top of his head now shaved is speaking quietly as paul listens you think if a man sincerely repents on what he done wrong he might get to
go back to the time that was happiest for him and live there forever
could that be what heaven is like
paul doesnt think so but thats not what bitterbuck needs to hear so the lie comes easy i just about believe that very thing
had me a young wife when i was eighteen
spent our first summer in the mountains
made love every night
shed just lie there after bare breasted in the firelight and wed talk sometimes till the sun come up
beat that was my best time
brutal appears at the door checks his pocketwatch nods to paul
bitterbuck takes a deep breath getting himself ready
itll be fine
youll do fine
the sponge is pulled sopping wet from the bucket of brine dripping a trail of water across the floor
brutal places it atop bitterbucks head
water courses down the sides of the condemned mans mask and neck pooling on the floor
the cap is lowered the straps secured
all we hear now is the sound of bitterbucks breathing growing louder and faster under the mask
until softly roll on two
the switch is thrown
bitterbuck surges forward against the straps riding the powerful current
some witnesses turn away
paul and brutal maintain grim eye contact with each other waiting
behind the partition percy watches through the mesh with gleaming eyes wishing he could see better
van hay kills the current
bitterbuck goes limp
a doctor steps forward checks for a heartbeat shakes his head
the switch is thrown a second time
bitterbuck surges forward again riding the current all the way
bitterbucks dead face stares up at us from a gurney
a hand reaches down gives his cheek a squeeze
tilt up to adios chief
drop us a card from hell let us know if its hot enough
brutal knocks percys hand away shoves him aside
hes paid what hes owed
hes square with the house again so keep your goddamn hands off him
he draws the sheet over bitterbucks face wheels the gurney down the tunnel
percy throws a look to paul
whats up his ass
paul brushes past him but you gotta hate the new boy
that the way it is around here
turns back why not just move on
go to briar ridge
off his look yeah i know about it
sounds like a good job
i might take it too
soon as you put me out front
paul cocks his head excuse me
you heard me
i want brutals spot for the next execution
beat whats with you
seeing a man die isnt enough
you gotta be close enough to smell his nuts cook
i wanna be out front is all
just one time
then youll be rid of me
if i say no
i might just stick around for good make me a career of this
paul just shakes his head in wonder and walks away
coffeys lying on his bunk weeping quiet tears
he stirs at the sound of giggling
he sits up peers curiously through the bars
paul glances up from writing in the daily log
he goes back to writing and the giggling comes again
just more giggling
paul rises walks down the mile to delacroixs cell and stops staring in through the bars
brutal and dean are having lunch
paul pokes his head in
you are not gonna believe this
the men follow paul onto the mile
by now del is cackling wildly in his cell
brutal shoots paul a look has he gone insane
paul gestures see for yourself
they arrive at the bars
and find the mouse sitting on dels shoulder
del looks up giggling like a kid at christmas
i done tame me dat mouse
we see that
watch what he do
he stretches out his left arm
the mouse crawls over the top of his head scampers along his arm to the wrist turns around and scampers back
the guards just stand there staring
aint he sumpthin now
dat his name
he whisper it in my ear
capn can i have a box for my mouse so he can sleep in here wi me
i notice your english gets better when you want something
wanna see what else he can do
watch watch watch
he puts the mouse on the floor grabs a small wooden spool
the mouse sees it poises like a man getting ready for a race
we play fetch mr
we play fetch
he tosses the spool across the floor bounces it against the wall
the mouse goes after it like a dog after a stick and proceeds to push it back to the bunk rolling it with its front paws all the way to
by now the guards jaws are hanging open
pauls got a funny little chill running up his spine
he fetch it ever time
smart as hell aint he
we do da trick again watch watch watch
again he throws the spool
again the mouse goes after it starts rolling it back
del howls with laughter claps his hands like a kid
brutal murmurs to the others whos training who here
thats some smart mouse del
like hes a circus mouse or something
a circus mouse
dat jus what he is too
a circus mouse
i get outta here he make me rich see if he dont
he picks up the spool again makes a drumroll sound tosses it
the mouse does its thing rolling the spool back
as percy enters the scene
del catches sight of him and scoops up his mouse drawing fearfully back on his bunk
he tries to hide mr
jingles in his hands but the mouse wriggles from his grasp and scampers up on top of his head where he regards percy with mistrustful beady mouse eyes
looks like you found yourself a new friend eddie
del tries to offer some defiance but all he can manage is don hurt him kay
percy shrugs as if to say no skin off me looks to paul
that the one i chased
level yes thats the one
only del says his name is mr
is that so
paul trades a look with the others everybody wondering just what the hells going through percys mind
del was just asking for a box
he thinks the mouse will sleep in it i guess
that he might keep it for a pet
what do you think
i think itll shit up his nose some night and run away but i guess thats dels lookout
beat we oughtta find a cigar box
get some cotton batting from he dispensary to line it with
that should do real nice
percy walks away leaving them dumbstruck
paul turns to the others
of all the things theyve seen in the last few minutes percy being nice is the most amazing of all
man said get a cigar box
paul comes up the stairs to the wardens office
and enters to find hal staring out the window
you wanted to see me
close the door
hals speech is halting his thoughts disjointed and slow uh
so you know
you got a new prisoner coming in tomorrow
wild as hell judging from this
he picks up the report trying to focus his thoughts been rambling all over the state last few years causing all kinds of trouble
finally hit big time
killed three people in a holdup including a pregnant woman
got billy the kid tattooed on his left arm
bad news all around
he trails off no longer able to focus on the words
paul is shocked to see tears spill silently down his cheeks
its a tumor paul
a brain tumor
paul doesnt know what to say
hal looks at him
they got x ray pictures of it
its the size of a lemon they said and way down deep inside where they cant operate
they say shell be dead by christmas
i havent told her
i cant think how
for the life of me paul i cant think how to tell my wife shes going to die
hal moores one of the toughest and steadiest men youd ever meets starts to cry
he dissolves into great big gasping sobs losing all control
paul lies awake watching jan sleep
he looks troubled not to mention feverish
it occurs to him how badly he has to pee
he sits up clutching at a queasy stab of pain in his groin
and comes hurrying down the steps clutching himself
and hes moving even faster as he exits the kitchen racing for the outhouse
he realizes hes not going to make it stops to piss near the woodpile at the corner of the house
and as he does hes hit with the most stunning pain of his life
he buckles to his knees its only his flailing hand against the woodpile that prevents him from going face first into his own piss
he crams his other hand to his mouth in an enormous effort not to scream and wake his wife
he manages to ride it out until his bladder empties
he falls onto his side rolls over on the grass and stares up at the sky with both hands pressed to his groin
coffeys hands paul looks feverish and clammy as he buttons up his uniform jacket
jan is packing his lunch throwing him looks knowing how sick he is
to the doctor
off her look today
just as soon as we get the new inmate squares away
she hands him his brown bagged lunch kisses his face
we see a tattoo billy the kid
tilt up to william wharton staring out the window wearing a hospital gown his face utterly blank
he looks heavily medicated
harry dean and percy enter
billy doesnt react just keeps staring out
harry waves his fingers in billys face
boys doped to the gills
dean hand me them clothes
dean relays some folded prison clothes to harry
im talking to you
put these clothes on
billy turns with a vacant look takes the clothes
he fumbles with the shirt drops the pants
harry and dean sigh
they strip billys hospital gown off and proceed to put the shirt on him guiding his limp arms through the sleeves
looks more like a limp noodle to me
billy looks up meets percys eyes
you been declared competent
know what that means
means youre gonna ride the lightning son
percy does a quick impression of a man jittering and jerking in the electric chair
just like that
hows it feel to know youre gonna die with your knees bent
cmon percy give us a hand
laughing percy picks up the pants
they proceed to help billy into them one leg at a time
paul is trying to piss
except for a few drops hitting the bowl excruciating pain seems to be the only result
he gives up grabs a towel wipes the sweat from his feverish face
and steps gingerly from the toilet
don look so good boss
look like you runnin you a fever
paul shoots him a baleful look no kidding
another voice calls softly from further down the mile boss edgecomb
needs ta see you down here boss
got things to tend to just now john coffey
you be still in your cell now yhear
coffey falls silent
paul goes to the entrance door and peers through the viewing slot anxious to have this over with
the prison truck appears swaying along the rutted road
while billy wharton stares at nothing drool dripping from his slack mouth in long strings
paul watches the truck pull in
he draws away from the slot proceeds toward the empty cell which used to be bitterbucks
the rear doors are swung open
dean and percy are guiding billy by the arm helping him down
paul waits at the empty cell
angle pans tight to coffey at his bars eyes widening in a blossoming of some nameless fear or dread
something bads coming
a whisper careful
billy is brought to the door
dean pulls his keys starts to unlock it
we push in on billys face where the tiniest trace of a smile is starting to grow
and coffeys unease grows with it
he presses his face to the bars his whispering becoming more urgent careful
paul hears him glances back with a puzzled look
coffeys gaze is directed at the door which is being unlocked
in that moment the slack look on billys face gives way to a wild grin
a crazed screech leaps from his throat a cross between a rebel yell and a dog being tortured freezing everybodys blood in their veins yeeeeeeehaaaawwwwwwrooooo
and he drops his wrist chain down over deans head jerks it tight begins to strangle him
dean lurches forward billy riding propelling him through the door onto the mile
percy stands frozen in the doorway stunned
harry shoves him aside and jumps on billy from behind trying to get him off dean
dean is choking turning purple
paul rushes from the cell to join the fray
billy whirls delivering a stunning kick to pauls groin
pauls bladder pain goes nuclear he falls back in agony clutching himself and sucking air through his teeth unable even to scream
billy rams an elbow into harrys face knocks him sprawling on the desk screaming and laughing and howling all the while paul forces himself to his feet pulls his revolver
draws down on billy
but billy jerks dean around using him as a shield
dean is choking dying
paul is shifting his aim trying for a clear shot not getting one
percys still just inside the doorway pressed against the wall with fear
and suddenly a hand comes in grabs the hickory stick out of percys grasp raises it high its brutal coming through the door
he swings the baton and lands an awesome blow to billys head thump
the force of it spins billy off his feet and slams him flat on his back
dean crawls away gulping ragged breaths of air
amazingly billys still conscious he looks up at brutal and laughs big fucker
snuck up on me
still laughing he makes another grab at dean
brutal whacks him again turning his lights out for good
brutal drops to deans side helping him hack air back into his lungs breathe
everybodys reining in their adrenaline
paul glares at harry
we thought he was doped
to percy didnt we
didnt we all of us think he was doped
percy nods still numb
paul is furious you didnt ask
i guess thats not a mistake youll be need to make again anytime soon is it
harry shakes his head miserably
paul grabs billy by the feet
grab his arms
you too percy
off percys hesitation percy goddamn it get your feet out of cement and help us out here
percy finally unfreezes
the three of them hoist billy up in a dead lift get him in his cell toss him on the cot
they step out slam the door lock it
paul looks to harry and brutal
get dean looked at right away make sure hes all right
percy you go make a report to the warden for me
start off by saying the situation is under control its not a story he wont appreciate you drawing out the suspense
what about you
you look about ready to collapse
ive got the mile till you all get back
go on now
they all exit
as soon as hes alone paul gives in to the pain holding his crotch and sinking to his knees with a moan
its so bad he actually lays down on the mile face pressed against the cool linoleum wishing he were dead
a stretch of silence
and then boss
needs ta see ya down here
this is not a good time john coffey
not a good time at all
but i needs ta see ya boss
i needs ta talk tya
things couldnt get much worse than this
he rises with a supreme effort walks painfully down the mile
and finds coffey waiting at his bars
im alone here right now john
figure this is close enough
i got to whisper in your ear
maybe its the fever clouding his brain or maybe
hell is this what being hypnotized is like
he tries to shake the sensation off comes a little closer
you know you not spose to do dat
mind your business del
what do you want john coffey
just to help
his hand shoots out grabs paul by the collar jerks him close
paul makes a panic grab for his revolver
but coffey lays his free hand atop pauls eases his grip from the gun no need for that
coffeys hand then drifts slowly down easing to pauls crotch
stunned frozen what are you
and something goes whump through pauls body
he arches back with his mouth agape and arms outstretched as a rush of energy seems to pass from paul through coffeys hand
and then its over
paul comes back to the real world weak against the bars realizes del is hollering in his cell del chrissake settle down im fine
it dawns on him that he really is fine
so is the pain in his groin
john coffey though seems to be having trouble
he sits down on his bunk bends forward gagging like a man with a chicken bone caught in his throat
john whats wrong
paul fumbles his keys to the lock unsure if he should open the door watching the big mans contortions grow stronger like a cat trying to cough up a hairball
and then comes an unpleasant gagging retching sound as coffeys lips draw back from his teeth in a kind of godawful sneer
and he exhales a cloud of what look like tiny black insects
they swirl furiously in front of his face turn white
paul just stares stunned
softly what did you do big boy
what did you do to me
i helped it
didnt i help it
coffey shrugs its something that just is
just took it back is all
awful tired now boss
he rolls onto his bunk faces the wall
paul just stares at him stunned
he turns and walks up the mile his stiffness and pain now gone
del watches him go by also stunned what dat man do to you
he throw some gris gris on you
off pauls look you look diffint
even walk diffint
like yall better
youre imagining thing
lie down del
get you some rest
paul continues up the mile
and steps back into the toilet
not trusting this situation for even a moment paul opens his fly takes a deep breath to prepare himself for the pain starts to pee
and we hear a healthy stream of water hitting the bowl
the look on pauls face says it all blessed relief
paul comes home from work still looking numb about the whole thing
he drifts to the kitchen door
jans at the counter slicing vegetables for dinner
she glances at him
how are you feeling
not too bad
she turns back
pauls eyes drift down to admire her ass
what did the doctor say
hes too busy staring
she turns again he glances hastily up
oh you know doctors
gobble de gook mostly
she turns back keeps working
he crosses the room eyeing her ass all the way
and surprised her by pressing up against her from behind running his hands along her hips
what are you doing
he starts laying kisses on the back of her neck giving her pleasant shivers murmuring whats it feel like
i know what it feels like
it feels great
hes getting her breathless
she turns into his arms and they get into some passionate kissing
its not too long before theyre frantically peeling each others clothes off
and we find them having a wild tumble in the sheets both moaning and groaning sweating and panting
she pushes him flat on the bed pauses to catch her breath
those mustve been some pills
and they keep going rutting like crazed weasels
as their moans go drifting into the night
and theyre still moaning up there as the sun creeps up
jan falls back exhausted after the latest go round
she catches her breath looks over at paul and finally paul
not that im complaining
but we havent gone four times in one night since we were nineteen
off his look you wanna tell me just what the hells going on
i never actually got to the doctor yesterday
she gives him a look oh
paul is on the phone brutal
im thinking of taking the morning off sick
you cover the fort for me
beat thats swell
yeah im sure ill feel better
he hangs up turns to jan
you sure you ought to do this
im not sure what im sure of
pauls model t comes putt putting up the road past a sign trapingus county welcomes you
burt hammersmith public defender for trapingus county sits with a cold soda and a magazine watching his two children playing on a swing at the far end of the backyard
the screen door opens and cynthia hammersmith ushers paul out
i offer you a cold drink
yes maam a cold drink would be fine
she goes back inside
your office said id find you at home today
i hope im not troubling you
that depends mr
im the e block superintendant at cold mountain
the green mile
ive heard of it
lost a few clients your way
thats why im here
id like to ask you about one of them
burt settles back down motions please sit
now you got my curiosity aroused
he causing you problems
no cant say he is
he doesnt like the dark
he cries on occasion
other than that
cries does he
well hes got a lot to cry about id say
you know what he did
nods i read the court transcripts
cynthia reappears hands paul a cold root beer
thank you missus
lunch is about ready
yall come on up
she goes back inside but the kids arent quite able to tear themselves away from their play
what exactly are you trying to find out
satisfy my curiosity ill see if i can satisfy yours
ive wondered if he ever did anything like that before
has he said anything
but a man who does a thing like that has often developed a taste for it over time
occurred to me it might be easy enough to follow his backtrail and find out
a man his size and colored to boot cant be that hard to trace
youd think so but youd be wrong
believe me we tried
its like he dropped out of the sky
how do you explain that
were in a depression
a third of the countrys out of work
people are drifting by the thousands looking for work looking for that greener grass
even a giant like coffey wouldnt get noticed everywhere he goes
not until he kills a couple of little girls
strange i admit
but there doesnt seem to be any real violence in him
i know violent men mr
i deal with em day in and day out
burt smiles realizing you didnt come up here to ask me whether he might have killed before
you came up here to see if i think he did it at all
thats it isnt it
one seldom sees a less ambiguous case
he was found with the victims in his arms
blurted out a confession right then and there
yet you defended him
everyone is entitled to a defense
cynthia hollers from an open window kids
yall listen to your momma now
the kids start this way
burt turns back to paul
tell you something
you listen close too because it might be something you need to know
we had us a dog
no particular breed but gentle
ready to lick your hand or fetch a stick
just a sweet mongrel you know the kind
paul nods in many way a good mongrel dog is like you negro
you get to know it and often you get to love it
it is of no particular use but you keep it around because you think it loves you
if youre lucky mr
edgecomb you never have to find out any different
my wife and i were not so lucky
come here for a second
the little boy comes to him staring at his feet
burt tires to raise the boys chin
the boy resists for a moment
and then his face comes around
hes horribly scarred on that side the eye missing
he has the one eye
i suppose hes lucky not to be blind
we get down on our knees and thank god for that much at least
the boy nods shyly okay go on in now
the boy races inside after his sister
paul follows burts gaze off toward the rear of the property where an unoccupied doghouse stands weathered and sad in the weeds
that dog attacked my boy for no reason
just got it into his mind one day
same with john coffey
he was sorry afterwards of that i have no doubt
but those little girls stayed raped and murdered nonetheless
maybe hes never done it before my dog never bit before but i didnt concern myself with that
i went out there with my rifle and grabbed his collar and blew his brains out
im sorry for your trouble
burt acknowledges the condolence with a gracious nod
im as enlightened as the next man mr
i would not bring back slavery for all the tea in china
i believe we have to be humane and generous in our efforts to solve the race problem
but we have to remember that the negro will bite if he gets the chance just like a mongrel dog will bite if it crosses its mind to do so
beat is coffey guilty
yes he is
dont you doubt it and dont you turn your back on him
you might get away with it once or even a hundred times
but in the end
he raises his hand making biting motions with his fingers
paul says nothing
burt gazes out again
softly im gonna have to tear that old doghouse down one of these days
paul drives back to cold mountain his heart conflicted
and he walks onto the mile with a bundle wrapped in a dish towel
brutal glances up from the desk sniffing the air
no its not for you
paul continues down the mile
whatever hes carrying the smell of it brings del to his bars
jingles comes skittering out of his cigar box sniffing
paul arrives at coffeys cell
coffeys on his bunk facing the wall
his head comes around drawn by the aroma
he sits up wipes the tears leaking from his eyes looks at paul
im smelling me some cornbread
paul speaks softly so the others cant hear its from my missus
she wanted to thank you
coffey nods thoughtfully absorbing this notion
then thank me for what
for helping me
helping you with what
paul motions discreetly to his crotch
beat was your missus pleased
paul hands him the bundle through the bars
coffey takes it uncovers the cornbread reverently gazes back up
this all for me
across the way del is pressing his face longingly through the bars while mr
jingles crawls on his shoulder
john i can smell it from here
i surely can
looks to paul can i give some to del
its yours john
you do with it as you please
john carefully scoops a big chunk of cornbread out with his enormous hand holds it through the bars to paul
heres for del and mr
what about me
ima get some too aint i coffey looks to paul do i have to
its yours john
as you please
i think ill keep the rest then
he smiles like a big kid digging in with his fingers
paul crosses the mile to dels cell hands him his share
courtesy of the gentleman across the way
so very fine of you
so very kind
jingles tank you
mouth full welcm
what about me
dont you hold out on me ya big dummy nigger
pauls temper flares he steps to billys cell
youll keep a civil tongue on my block
billy spits in pauls face and follows it up with a big grin what are you gonna do about that
paul is seething as he wipes the spit off but keeps his temper where it belongs
you get that one for free
but thats the last one
paul walks away
billy laughs hollering after him thats it
just that little bitty one
guess ill have to pay out for the rest huh
harry is walking the mile doing a cell check and jotting on a clipboard
he pauses making a notation
and a long stream of piss hits his leg
billys at his bars peeing on him
harry jumps back stunned
billy howls with laughter hosing his aim wildly from side to side
good shot werent it
oh the look on your face
paul and brutal come running
harrys just flabbergasted you believe this
son of a bitch pissed on me
hey djall like that
im currently cooking some turds tgo with it
nice soft ones
ill have em out tyall tomorrow
paul stays calm turns to brutal nods at the restraint room
weve been looking to clear that room out anyway
a stream of guards comes toting the last of the restraint room stuff past billys cell while he heckles them from the bars
whassit now movin day
yall wanna come in and dust a little
ycan shine my knob for me while yer at it
and he pauses as paul and brutal step to the bars
paul has a canvas straitjacket
brutal pulls his nightstick
you can come in here on your legs but youll go out on your backs billy the kid guarantee ya that
motions to brutal cmon fuckstick
no sneakin up on me this time
well go man to man see whos the better fel brutal unlocks the cell and sidesteps revealing harry pointing a fire hose
the hose erupts driving billy across the cell with bone jarring force
they batter him half senseless then cut the water
billy collapses in a heap
paul and brutal drag him semi conscious from his cell and get the straitjacket on him
he comes around as they draw the straps tight and pull him to his feet
cmon wild bill
little walky walky
dont you call me that
wild bill hickock wasnt no range rider
he was just a bushwackin john law
dumb sonovabitch sat with his back to the door and kilt by a drunk
oh my suds and body
a history lesson
you just never know what youre gonna get when you come to work everyday on the green mile
thank you wild bill
billy lets out a scream of rage and throws himself at brutal
brutal bored shoves him back toward paul who then propels him down the mile toward the open restraint room door
billy sees where they intend to put him resorts to pleading oh not in there
cmon now ill be good
honest injun i will
he suddenly drops to the floor bucking and jerking wildly spewing drool
harrys eyes go wide
holy christ hes pitchin a fit
paul reaches down and unceremoniously starts dragging billy kicking and writhing the rest of the way
hell be fine boys
trust me on this one
brutal helps paul toss billy headlong into the padded room
they slam the door
and billy staggers to his feet in the straitjacket inarticulate with rage starts throwing himself against the door screaming at the top of his lungs
paul and brutal unlock the restraint room
billy looks up from the corner pale and drained
softly i learnt my lesson
ill be good
billys back in his cell quiet for a change
toot toot is outside the bars mopping the floor
billy notices a chocolate moon pie in toots shirt pocket
giveya nickel for that moon pie
toot looks around
nobodys watching and a nickels a nickel
he steps to billys bars swaps the moon pie for the money
toot hurries away
billy unwraps the moon pie makes sure hes not being watched
and crams the entire thing into his mouth
and here comes brutal strolling down the mile doing a cell check and jotting on a clipboard
he pauses seeing billy at his bars
just standing there staring
his cheeks bulging way out
brutal steps closer fascinated
what the fuck is that
billy waits until hes just a bit closer and he slams his fists against his own cheeks propelling a disgusting spew of liquefied chocolate sludge into brutals face
billy falls back onto his bunk shrieking with laughter lil black sambo yassuh boss yassuh howdoo you do
beat calmly hope your bags are packed
and once again billy gets dragged to the restraint room kicking and screaming all the way
they toss him in slam the door
brutal turns still wiping traces of sludge off
the moon pie thing was pretty original
gotta give him that
they walk away as we paul and brutal appear at dels bars with harry and dean
del grab your things
big day for you and mr

important folks heard about your mouse wanna see him perform

one of thems a politician all the way from the state capital i believe
del swells with pride upon hearing this

jingles props steps from his cell looks to harry and dean

del nods beaming happily looks to coffey in his cell
you knock em for a loop like mr
harry says del
brutal leads del up the mile paul and the others at their heels
percys at the duty desk
he smirks and rolls his eyes as del goes by
the moment brutal and del are out the door
toot emerges from pauls office where hes been hiding
lets move along briskly folks
theres not much time
toot hurries down to take his place in dels cell
im sittin down im sittin down im sittin down
a half dozen guards are waiting
we find bill dodge fixing the tie of a fat good ol boy named earl
been sweepin floors here ten years never had to wear no damn tie before
youre a v
today earl so just shut up
a knock at the door
everybody takes a seat
del is ushered in by brutal
del faces his audience puts his hands to his chest in a thank you gesture worthy of lillie langtry before her adoring public then announces grandly messieurs et mesdames
bienvenue au cirque de mousie
the steel cap is lowered over toots head the straps tightened
tilt up to percy as roll on two
behind his partition van hay mimes flipping the switch
percy looks anxiously to paul whos trading glances with the other guards
finally very good
harry and dean step up slapping his back and shaking his hand
and theyre still chatting a short time later waiting for dels return
percy actually looks happy for a change feeling genuinely accepted for the first time
billy is watching from his cell
the door opens
del returns with mr
jingles on his shoulder escorted by brutal
brutal is toting the cigar box and spool like a magicians assistant carrying the boss props
they love mr
they laugh and cheer and clap they hands
well thats just aces
pop back in your cell old timer
the generosity of percys tone catches del completely off guard
del gives him a look of almost comical mistrust
and the old percy comes back
he bares his teeth in a mock snarl and curls his fingers as if to grab del
its a joke but del doesnt know that he jerks back in fear and trips over brutals big feet
del goes down hard hitting the linoleum with the back of his head
jingles jumps clear goes squeaking down the mile
del sits up painfully clutching his head
brutal helps him up
percy you shit
and moves him toward his cell
percy is actually moved to apologize he starts after them with a half laugh drifting much too close to wild bills side of the mile
hey you numb wit i didnt mean nothin by it
you all ri and wild bills arms thrust out grabbing percy and slamming him back against the bars with an arm around his throat
percy squeals like a pig in a slaughter chute thinking hes gonna die
the guards scramble drawing their clubs as billy strokes percys hair and whispers in his ear aint you sweet
like a girl
i druther fuck your asshole than your sisters pussy i think
billy kisses percys ear and his hand drops down to squeeze percys crotch
paul pulls his sidearm taking aim
and billy lets go stepping back with his hands raised laughing
percy darts across the mile in terror and cringes against the cell opposite breathing so loud and fast it almost sounds like sobbing
i let im go ius just playin and i let im go
never hurt a hair on his purty head
grins at percy your noodle aint limp at all loverboy
i think you sweet on ol billy the kid
sniffs his fingers oooh but smell you
down at his cell del starts laughing shrilly
everybody else starts to realize it including percy himself
he looks down sees the huge dark stain spreading at his crotch
lookit he done piss his pants
look what the big man done
he bus other people wid is stick mais oui some mauvais homme but someone touch him he make water in his pants jus like a baby
percy just stares
brutal shoves delacroix into his cell

paul steps to percy puts a hand on his shoulder
percy shakes his hand off looks around at their faces whispers you talk about this to anyone ill get you all fired
i swear that to god
what happens on the mile stays on the mile
the men nod solemnly
nobodys going to talk about this
percy looks at delacroix still snorting in his cell points at him
you keep laughing you french fried faggot
you just keep laughing
del falls silent
percy turns and storms away as we the bad death of eduard delacroix paul is sitting with delacroix
brutal is leaning against the bars
del is throwing the spool
jingles is fetching it
the silence is thick
just the clack clatter of the spool and the skitter skitter of tiny mouse paws on concrete
its getting on pauls nerves in a big way
softly what about dean
hes got a little boy would love a pet mouse i bet
del looks horrified at the thought
how could a boy be trust wid mr
maybe forget to feed him
and how he keep up wid his trainin just a boy nest ce pas
del tosses the spool again clack clatter skitter skitter
all right ill take him
tank you kindly merci beaucoup but you live out in the woods and mr
jingles he be scared to live out dans la foret
he whisper that in your ear
del nods tosses the spool again clack clatter skitter skitter
paul is completely out of ideas
but then how about mouseville
tourist attraction down in florida
tallahassee i think
is that right paul
level yeah thats right
just down the road apiece from the dog university
brutals mouth twitches but he manages to keep a straight face
he gives paul a look dont blow this
you think theyd take mr
you think hes got the stuff
hes pretty smart
what dis mouseville
tourist attraction i said
they got this big tent you go into like a cirque
you have to pay
you shittin me
course you pay
dime a piece two cents for the kids
and inside the tent theres this mouse city made out of boxes and toilet paper rolls
percy is drifting up the block listening too but nobodys really paying him much mind
plus they got the mouseville all star circus
theres mice that swing on trapeze mice that roll barrels mice that stack coins
dats da place for mr
you gonna be a circus mouse after all
gonna live in a mouse city down in florida
del tosses the spool extra hard it takes a bad bounce off the wall and goes clattering through the bars onto the mile
the mouse goes after it like a shot too intent to notice his old enemy percy
percy stomps the heel of his heavy work shoe down on mr
theres a soft snap as the mouses back breaks
del screams in horror and throws himself at the bars sobbing the mouses name
percy looks to brutal and paul smiles
knew id get him sooner or later
just a matter of time really
he turns and strolls up the mile leaving mr
jingles dying in a tiny pool of blood
up at the duty desk dean and harry get up from a cribbage game stunned and furious
percy strolls past exits to the execution chamber
del is still screaming all his pent up terror and grief pouring out at the dying mouse
and then comes a soft urgent voice givem to me
coffeys got his arms out through his bars one massive hand spread open
givem to me
might still be time
paul hesitates scoops the mouse up off the floor wincing at the feel of it
splintered bones are poking at the hide
what are you doing
paul doesnt answer just lays mr
jingles into coffeys hand
coffey pulls the mouse in through his bars and lays his other hand gently over it cupping the creature
all we see now is the tail hanging out the side twitching weakly
paul what the hell paul motions him quiet
del is pleading softly at his bars please john
oh johnny help him please help him sil vous plait
harry and dean join the group
everybody watching now
coffey puts his mouth to his cupped hands inhales sharply
the world hangs suspended for a moment
coffey raises his face contorting as if desperately ill starts making those horrendous choking sounds in his throat
softly oh dear jesus
look at the tail
the tail is no longer weak and dying
its snapping briskly back and forth as if ready to play
coffey makes that retching gagging sound
and again exhales a cloud of swirling black insects from his nose and mouth
the men watch speechless as the bugs turn white and disappear
coffey bends down opens his hand
jingles bounds off his fingers through the bars racing past the guards feet
they turn to see del gather the mouse up laughing and crying
dean turns back to coffey with a stunned whisper what did you do
i helped dels mouse
he a circus mouse
goan live in a mouse city down in
coffey nods remembering
boss percys bad
he step on dels mouse
softly i took it back though
and with that he lies back on his bunk and faces the wall
the others look to paul dont even know what to say
brute come along with me
to harry and dean you fellas go on back to you cribbage game
harry nods numbly
paul leads brutal up the mile
and they enter to find percy polishing old sparkys arms
dont start in on me
it was just a mouse
never belonged here in the first place
the mouse is fine
youre no better at mouse killing than anything else around here
you expect me to believe that
i heard the goddamn thing crunch
paul steps closer angry as weve ever seen him arent you glad mr
jingles is okay
after all our talks about how we should keep the prisoners calm
arent you relieved
what kind of game is this
see for yourself
percy stalks past them heads out onto the mile
paul and brutal just wait saying nothing
brutal picks up the rag left by percy resumes polishing chores on old sparky
paul stretches cracks his neck
the silence heavy
until percy reappears
you switched them
you switched them somehow you bastards
i always keep a spare mouse in my wallet for occasions such as this
youre playing with me the both of you
just who the hell do you think you are brutal grabs him slams him bodily into the electric chair
paul bends close gets right in percys face
were the people you work with percy but not for long
i want your word
i put you out front for del you put in your transfer to briar ridge the very next day
what if i just call up certain people and tell them youre harassing me
i promise youll leave your share of blood on the floor
over a mouse
you think anyones gonna give two shits
but four men will swear you stood by while wild bill tried to strangle dean to death
about that people will care percy
even your uncle the governor will care
thing like that goes in your work record
work record can follow a man around a long long time
percy looks from one man to another knowing hes trapped
i put you out front you put in your transfer
thats the deal
percy thinks it over nods
he tries to get up but paul keep him pinned
and pointedly offer his hand
you make a promise to a man you shake his hand
percy hesitates shakes pauls hand
and paul pulls him out of the electric chair as we witnesses are trickling in filling the seats
a storm is brewing sending flashes of lightning across the floors
del sits with mr
jingles in his lap stroking the mouse between the ears
paul brutal and harry appear at the bars
say hi mr
eduard delacroix will you step forward
don let nothin happen to mr
paul nods i promise
del rises steps to paul

del lifts his hand
jingles steps off onto pauls shoulder with no hesitation

if del don mind
yeah you take im john

to paul and brutal after you take him down to florida

paul moves to coffeys cell
the mouse skitters off pauls shoulder onto coffeys hand
people pay a dime apiece to see him
two cents for the kiddies
aint dat right boss howell
thats right del
you a good man boss howell
you too boss edgecomb
wish i coulda met you bot someplace else
del gives mr
jingles one last look starts to cry
au revoir mon ami
je taime mon petit
and they start to walk the mile
sweltering in the damp heat
rain is pissing down drumming the tin roof
people glance up uneasily as thunder booms
a fat lady is staring grimly at the electric chair
hope hes good and scared
hope he knows the fires are stoked and that satans imps are waiting
del enters horrified to see percy waiting at old sparky
paul gives dels arm a reassuring squeeze leads him forward
the clamps are applied
the straps are drawn tight
roll on one
the lights brighten on a rising hum
witnesses look up
coffey looks up as the overheads flare hotter and hotter whispers to the mouse in his hands you be still mr
you be so quiet and so still
eduard delacroix you have been condemned to die by a jury of your peers sentence imposed by a judge in good standing in this state
you have anything to say before sentence is carried out
del tries to speak
doesnt quite manage the first time
licks his lips and tries again
i sorry for what i do
i give anything to take it back but i cant
god have mercy on me
whispers to paul don forget bout mouseville
paul and brutal nod and are stunned as no such place
thats just a fairy tale these guys told you to keep you quiet
just thought you should know faggot
the stricken look in dels eyes tells us a part of him had known all along
paul and brutal would both like to deck percy right about now and he knows it he gives them a what are you gonna do about it smile
nothing they can do
paul nods to harry who takes the black mask from the back of the chair and rolls it down over dels head leaving the top of his shaved head exposed
takes the sponge and bends down to the bucket of brine
the other dont see it but we do percy only pretends to dip the sponge and soak it
it never touches the water
he straightens up and places the sponge atop delacroixs head hiding it with his hands
the cap is lowered
paul and the others havent yet realized whats happened
thunder booms and lightning crashes as percy hides a smile steps back to address the condemned electricity shall now be passed through your body until you are dead in accordance
with state law
god have mercy on your soul
as realization starts to dawn
he stares at the bucket then across the floor to delacroix coming to terms with the evidence of his eyes theres no water on the floor or dripping down the
sides of dels neck
pauls eyes widen
a stunned beat of horror
he starts to open his mouth to scream no
but percy beats him to it with roll on two
van hay flicks the switch
the electricity hits home and del rocks forward riding the current
then things start to go horribly wrong
the humming loses its steadiness and starts to waver with a crackling sound
tendrils of smoke begin curling from under the cap a mixture of burning hair and sponge
brutal shoots paul a horrified look
paul responds with a harsh whisper its dry
delacroix begins twisting and jittering in the chair his masked face snapping violently from side to side his legs pistoning up and down in his restraints
theres a muffled pop from under the cap like a pine knot exploding in a hot fire
smoke starts coming through the fabric of the mask puffing upward
del is being cooked alive
paul spins to the partition hollering but brutal grabs his arm whispers fiercely dont you tell him to stop
dont you do it
its too late for that
paul turns back helpless
the other guards are trading wild looks unable to believe whats happening
even percy looks aghast he was expecting something but not this
del begins screaming the wild hysterical sound of an animal being shredded alive in a hay baler
the humming goes uneven and ragged the lights rising and falling
as dels screams rise and fall with them echoing up the corridor
coffeys shaking and screaming too as if feeling dels pain
jingles squirms out of his grasp and goes squeaking in terror toward the restraint room door
dels nowhere near about done
hes slamming back and forth in the chair hard enough to shake the platform twisting hard against the leather restraints
we hear bones breaking
a womans screams
witnesses start rising to their feet what the hells happening to him
are those clamps going to hold
christ the smell
is this normal
the mask bursts into flame on delacroixs face
van hay hollers through the wire mesh horrified harry scoops up the bucket of water to throw it
harry backs off with a look of dazed understanding you dont throw water on a man getting juiced
he drops the bucket races to get the chemical fire extinguisher instead
the flaming mask peels away revealing dels charring face
his eyeballs are misshapen globs of burning white jelly blown out of their sockets
the attending doctor faints dead away
pandemonium now in the room
people shouting and hurrying to exit chairs falling over women screaming stop it stop it oh cant you see hes had enough
hal grabs paul by the shoulder spins him around
why dont you shut it down
hes still alive
you want me to shut down while hes still alive
hal is horrified at the thought
del is jittering and screaming rocking from side to side smoke pouring from his nostrils and mouth his tongue sizzling purple black
the witnesses are crowding and shoving to get out but the back door is locked
all they can do is cluster there
paul sees percy with his head turned away
he grabs him forces his head around
you watch you son of a bitch
harry steps up the extinguisher in his hands
del finally slumps over
he still vibrating but now its just the effect of current flowing through his body
van hay kills the current
the humming dies
brutal grabs the extinguisher from harry shoves it into percys hands
you do it
youre running the show aint you
percy sick and dazed aims the extinguisher and hoses the smoking corpse
hal is near the back calming the crowd its all right folks its all under control
just a power surge from the storm thats all nothing to worry about
dean get docs stethoscope
dean drops to the doctors bag digs through it hands up the stethoscope
paul plugs them into his ears
people are moaning and sobbing at the back of the room oh my god
is it always like this
why didnt somebody tell me
i never would have come
paul wipes some foam away from delacroixs chest places the stethoscope pad to the raw flesh
he nods to brutal its over
paul and the others bring the stretcher down lay the corpse on the gurney
percy starts stammering excuses i didnt know the sponge was supposed to be wet brutal hauls off and slugs him
a scuffle ensues as the others grab brutal and pull him off
what do you mean no
how can you say no
you saw what he did
delacroixs dead nothing can change that and percys not worth it
so he just gets away with it
is that how it works
hal comes lunging down the stairs furious what the fuck was that
jesus christ three witnesses puked all over the floor up there
and the smell
i got van hay to open both doors but that smell wont come out for five damn years thats what im betting
and that asshole wharton is singing about it
i can hear him
quietly can he carry a tune hal
this pulls the plug on the moment hal snorts triggering laughter among the men a wild release of tension and fear
everybody starts feeling a bit saner again as it dies down okay boys
now what the hell happened
all eyes go to percy
hal turns sees percys bloody lip
something to say
i didnt know the sponge was supposed to be wet
a look of utter contempt from hal
how many years you spend pissing on the toilet seat before somebody told you to put it up
percy fucked up hal
pure and simple
is that your official position
dont you think it should be
hal considers it nods
hell be putting in a transfer request to briar ridge tomorrow
moving on to bigger and better things
isnt that right percy
hal steps close gives him a tight icy smile
youre a little asshole and i dont like you a bit
off percys look have that transfer request on my desk first thing
hal heads back up the stairs
brutal shoves percy aside and wheels delacroixs body down the tunnel
paul returns to find wild bill making up a song in his cell singing barbecue
me and you
stinky pinky phew phew phew
werent billy or jilly or hilly or roy it was a french fried faggot named delacroix
youre about ten seconds away from spending the rest of your life in the padded room
billy falls silent
paul continues down the mile to coffeys cell
coffeys on his bunk face streaked with tears
he wipes his eyes with the heels of his hands like an exhausted child
poor old del
poor old del
john are you okay
i could feel it from here
what do you mean
you could hear it
is that what you mean
hes out of it now though
hes the lucky one
no matter how it happened dels the lucky one
paul realizes he wont get a coherent answer
points vaguely ran down there
dont think hell be back
beat awful tired now boss
coffey lays down turns to face the wall
me too john
paul enters in darkness hangs his hat
he drifts into the kitchen clicks on the radio
soft music begins gene austin singing did you ever see a dream walking
he pours a drink at the kitchen table takes a sip lays the glass down
jan sleepily appears from the darkness behind him entering the kitchen
he realizes shes there glances back
she can sense the weight on his soul
she comes to him folds his head into her arms
they stand that way he drawing strength and she giving it as the music plays on
camera tracks the pews to find paul and jan seated together in the congregation voices raised in hymn
pauls model t comes sputtering up the road
he and jan are taking a drive still in their sunday best
paul and jan wait at the front door
jan holds a baking dish
i hate this
the door opens
hal looking tired ushers them inside
and they walk outside to find melinda moores sitting in the sun frail and wasted a blanket on her knees
shed be beautiful if not for the cancer killing her
paul is shocked at her appearance hides it as best as he can
jan covers this for him she drops to melindas side with a warm smile and a kiss takes the womans frail hands in hers
paul catches jans eye
the look he gives her says it all i dont know what id do without you
and we find paul and hal talking quietly over beers while the women visit b
shes having one of her good days
i thank god for that
what a bad day
beat sometimes shes
not herself anymore
it just pops out the most awful language you can imagine
she doesnt even know shes doing it
i didnt know shed ever heard words like that
and to hear her say them in her sweet voice
gazes off im glad shes having a good day paul
im glad for you and jan
paul is wide awake staring at the dark
jan can sense him brooding
she rolls over sleepily
if you dont say whats on your mind im afraid ill have to smother you with a pillow
im thinking i love you
im thinking i dont know what id do if you were gone
beat im also thinking id like to have the boys over tomorrow
off jans look we brutal harry and dean are seated at the table with paul and jan
serving plates are being passes everybody digging in various ad lib maam you sure know how to fry up some fine chicken
brutal dont hog the taters now
try that corn yet
its something special
paul softly interjects you saw what he did with the mouse
this stops everybody cold
dean puts his chicken down wipes his hands
looks are traded in the silence
i coulda gone the rest of the day without you bringing that up
i coulda gone the rest of the year
he did it to me too
he put his hands on me and took my bladder infection away
the men absorb this
brutal glances to jan
when he came home he was
youre talking about an authentic healing
a praise jesus miracle
if you say it i accept it
but whats it got to do with us
jan looks to paul realization starting to dawn melinda
paul nods thats who were talking about
you really think you can help her
its not a bladder infection or even a busted up mouse
but there might be a chance
hold on now
youre talking about our jobs
sneak a sick woman onto a cellblock
hal would never allow that
you know him he wouldnt believe something unless it fell on him
so youre talking about taking john coffey to her
thats more than just our jobs paul
thats prison time if we get caught
lets not discuss this like its even an option
brutal help me out here
brutal lets out a deep breath considering
he looks to paul
im sure shes a fine woman
whats happening to her is an offense brutal
to the eyes and the ears and the heart
i have no doubt
but we dont know her like you and jan do
thats why its a lot to ask
lets not forget coffeys a murderer
what if he escapes
id hate losing my job or going to prison but id hate having a dead child on my conscience even more
i dont think thatll happen
beat softly in fact i dont think he did it at all
the men are stunned by this
off their looks i just cant see god putting a gift like that in the hands of a man who would kill a child
well thats a tender notion but the mans on death row for the crime
plus hes huge
if he tried to get away itd take a lot of bullets to stop him
wed all have shotguns in addition to sidearms
id insist on that
to paul he tried anything wed have to take him down
tell us what you had in mind
night journey a flashlight beam plays across a glass cabinet scanning the contents
the beam pauses
a hand enters frame unlocks the cabinet pulls out a bottle of morphine tablets
and we angle to brutal as he shakes half a dozen pills onto his palm pockets them replaces the bottle on the shelf
he turns and slips five bucks to a nightshift orderly
i was never here
shit for five bucks you was never nowhere
a morphine pill is being crushed to powder on the stainless steel gurney
tilt up to paul crushing the pills
brutal carefully scrapes the powder onto a small sheet of paper
percy is parked in pauls chair with his feet up reading a book titled caring for mental patients
harry and dean are playing cards at the duty desk tension thick cards slapping softly as the seconds tick by
paul and brutal finally show up toting bottles of rc cola fellas thirsty
fresh out of the icebox
yeah hot in here
they begin popping the caps off swigging cola
the sound of it brings billy to his bars
hey ima get some too
my ass you get some too
you think you deserve any
checks a clipboard day report says hes been okay
hell yes i been behaved
cmon now dont be stingy hogs
paul shrugs to brutal why not
brutal pops the top off a bottle passes it to paul
paul grabs a tin cup sets it on the desk
and we see it contains the morphine powder
he pours the cola swirls it around
as coffey looks up sensing something happening
he peers up the mile as paul walks to billy reaches for the cup but paul keeps it out of reach
you gonna stay behaved
cmon you clunk gimme that
you promise me or ill drink it myself right here in front of you
cmon now dont be that way
i be good
paul lets him take the cup
billy knocks it back draining it in three huge swallows
he lets out an awesome belch
well break out the fire hose and take it anyway
and you will have drunk your last r
unless they serve em down in hell
billys smile fades
he hands the cup through the bars
paul takes it turns and heads back to where brutal harry and dean have been watching the entire exchange with their hearts in their throats
and we find billy staring glassy eyed at the ceiling
he keels over on his bunk
angle to paul and brutal stepping to the bars with harry and dean
anybody wants to back out nows the time
after this theres no turning back
off their looks so
we gonna do this
a voice comes softly from down the way sure
id like to take a ride
their heads come slowly around staring at coffey in shock
to paul guess were all in
percy looks up from his book as the door opens
paul enters with brutal and harry ominously hemming the desk
what is this
paul pulls the canvas straitjacket from behind his back
percy jumps up and tries to the execution chamber but harry grabs him spins him back
a wild scuffle ensues as let go of me
settle down percy
percy tries to jerk away crashes into the desk
the book he was reading falls to the floor and a tijuana bible is revealed within the pages
its a pornographic cartoon book of the type popular in the s featuring crude drawings of famous cartoon characters or movie stars engaged in outlandish sexual acts
this one has olive oyl getting it doggy style from popeye
the word balloon over his head features his famous laugh uk uk uk uk
what would your mother say
let go you ignoramus
i know people
so youve said
cmon stick out your arms like a good boy
and you cant make me
youre dead wrong about that you know
brutal grabs percy by the ears twisting hard
percy lets out a shriek not just of pain but a dismayed understanding that hes not going to bluster his way out of this one
you gonna put your arms up
ill rip your ears off
use em for tea caddies
you know i will
the mans ripping your ears off percy
id do as he says
percy jerks his arms up before him
they get the straitjacket on him within seconds
percy turns to paul on the verge of tears
softly please paul
dont put me in with wild bill
you would think that
paul gives him a hard angry shove
and they bring him down the mile to the restraint room door
brutal takes percys holster and baton
youll get em back dont worry
thats more than i can say about your jobs
all your jobs
you cant do this to me
paul steps forward with a roll of strapping tape
let you in on a little secret
we can and we are
he slaps the tape over percys mouth and shoves him back into the restraint room
percy stands breathing heavily through his nose making muffled mmmmph mmmph
sounds under the tape
youre going to have a few hours of quiet time now so you can reflect on what you did to del
grins if you get lonely think about olive oyl
thrusting his hips uk uk uk uk
and they slam the door shutting percy into darkness
is unlocked shotguns pulled out
the men load up heading down the mile as one more time what do you say if somebody comes by
coffey got upset so we put him in the restraint room
they hear any noise theyll think its him
they come to coffeys cell
we goan for the ride now
the cell is unlocked
paul motions them along still grilling dean what about us
youre over in admin going over dels file
brutal and harry are in the laundry doing their wash a skinny white arm suddenly shoots out from wild bills cell and grabs coffey by the wrist
the men gasp shocked to see billy on his feet grinning and weaving like a punch drunk
coffeys reaction is beyond simple surprise hes actually trembling at billys touch as if some electrical circuit were engaged
his eyes are wide and horrified as if hed just put his hand in a basket full of snakes
he tries to pull away but billy has him tight that mysterious circuit blazing
slurring wildly where you fink youre goin
coffey responds softly with utmost horror youre a bad man
bad as youd want
paul plucks billys hand off coffeys arm and coffey flinches back as the circuit is broken
whole rooms spinning
like im shit ass drunk
i have me some shine or what
he turns and staggers back to his bunk muttering all the way niggers oughtta have they own lectric chair
white man oughtnt havta sit in no nigger lectric chair nossir
he goes face first onto his bunk
coffey is still staring
hes a bad man
coffey is brought in
and freezes in horror at the sight of old sparky
a whisper theyre still in there
pieces of them still in there
i hear them screaming
all eyes go to the electric chair
it sits shrouded in shadow like an ominous throne
never before has this place felt so haunted to the men
it makes the hairs on the neck stand up
john come along
right now yhear
toward that door
coffey finally responds pulling away
and they come down the steps
they realize coffey will have to stoop all the way down the tunnel
paul pats the gurney
lie down on this
off coffeys look itll be easier for you and no harder for us
coffey eases carefully onto the gurney lying on his back
his knees hang over the edge and his toes touch the ground but it works
they push him along traversing the pools of light
coffey actually starts to smile
he reaches out his arms fingertips touching the tunnel walls as they go by
this is fun
a massive iron door squeals open onto a little used fenced enclosure
paul and the others bring coffey up from the tunnel below emerging into the night
coffeys breath catches as he gazes wondrously up at the stars pointing look boss
its cassie the lady in the rocking chair
john you have to be quiet now
whispering you see her
you see the lady
we see her john
harry goes first hugging the shadows as he pulls his keys to unlock the gate
while tower guards huddle in their enclosure atop the walls
an occasional spotlight cuts the darkness
fireflies dance in the fields and trees as far as the eye can see
four dark figures detach from the shadows hurrying across the lonely country road into the fields on the far side
coffeys hand scoops up some fallen leaves
tilt up to his face as he crunches them under his nose inhaling their smell
he see the guards throwing him anxious looks
he misreads this holds out his hand so they can smell too
they do it just to make him happy
cmon big boy keep moving
a few fireflies come winking through frame as the group presses on
the trees are growing sparser opening onto fields
more fireflies are flitting into view trailing in their wake
how far is it
just up ahead
harry brings them to a thicket of trees
they start removing branches and boughs uncovering a battered old farmall truck hidden in the brush
the men pause
even more fireflies are swirling around them growing in number
its getting downright weird
coffey laughs softly drawing their attention
a childlike smile has utterly transformed his face
he raises his hand letting a firefly weave playfully in and out of his fingers
hey there little firefly
firefly this evening
another firefly joins the first both now dancing and blinking around his fingers
coffey laughs again
oh there you is
you come out to play too
the men stand gaping
the fireflies are flitting to coffey as if to a beacon
he waves his hands slowly fireflies blinking and trailing from his fingertips like magic dust
they begin orbiting his shiny bald head like tiny glowing planet orbiting a sun their light kicking a mellow sheen off his ebony skin
coffeys eyes meet pauls
drawn to you
i love em is why
they dont think no hurtful thoughts
theys just happy to be
happy little lightning bugs
the men dont know whether to be enchanted or terrified
harry gives paul a look can we go
cmon big boy
coffey clambers up on the stakebed
paul and brutal join him
harry gets in behind the wheel jabs the starter button
while coffey sits with his back to the cab
do you know where were taking you
help a lady
help a lady
but how did you know
tell the truth boss i dont know mucha anything
the truck pulls out
coffey waves as the fireflies get left behind dwindling away like stars
the truck rumbles from the fields onto a dirt road countless fireflies swirling in its wake
headlights come over the rise
the truck appears rumbling down toward the house
the world is isolated and still
harry stops and cuts the engine leaving the headlights on
silence now save for the trilling of crickets
paul and brutal both look terrified now that theyre actually here
an urgent whisper we can still turn back
paul hesitates wanting to do just that but boss look
lights are coming on inside the house
coffey rises and steps down from the truck pulling paul along
brutal follows them
this is a mistake
christ paul what were we thinking
too late now
harry keep john here until we call you
paul and brutal walk to the front door as the lights inside the house keep clicking on
the last one finally comes on over the stoop the front door opens a crack
and the twin barrels of a shotgun poke out into the night
who the hell goes there at two thirty in the goddamn morning
hal its us
its paul and brutal its us
the door swings wider revealing hals face gaunt and haggard in the yellow porch light stunned to see them paul what are you doing here at this hour
jesus its not a lockdown is it
or a riot
hal gods sakes take your finger off the trigger
hal doesnt aiming past them at the truck in the yard
are you hostages
whos out there
whos by that truck
coffey steps into the glare of headlights with harry tugging on his arm trying to hold him back
hal cocks both hammers
halt right there or i shoot
his aim wavers as a womans voice comes from upstairs hal
who are you talking to you fucking cocksucker
a frozen moment
paul gives him a look is that melinda
hals shotgun shifts back to coffey but paul steps in front of the muzzle
no ones hurt
were here to help
i dont understand
is this a prison break
i cant explain what it is
you just have to trust me
coffey comes up the steps brushes paul aside stops before the warden
hal blinks his thoughts suddenly fuzzy its that benign hypnotic effect coffey has
what do you
make them go away
no salesmen in the middle of the night
no fuller brushes
no french knickers with come in the crotch
tell them to take a flying fuck in a rolling d
we hear the sound of glass breaking then she begins to sob
a whisper just to help
just to help boss thats all
no one can
coffey pulls the shotgun gently from hals grasp hands it to paul
coffey moves past hal into the house
and comes up the hallway toward the stairs
dont you go up there
dont you do it
boss you just be quiet now and let me be
coffey mounts the stairs with the others at his heels heading up toward that quavering voice stay out of here
whoever you are just stay out
im not dressed for visitors you rats asshole
coffey enters trailed by the others
paul pauses horrified
the woman propped in bed barely resembles melinda moores anymore she looks made up like a halloween witch her livid skin hanging in a loose trail of wrinkles one corner
of her mouth twisted
yellowish bile stains her chin and the front of her nightgown
her hair has gone white and straw like her eyes glowering at coffey with lively irrational interest oh so big
pull down your pants
lets have a look
hal groans with despair
coffey just stands there for a moment watching her from a distance then approaches the bed
dont come near me pigfucker
but as he draws closer a change occurs
her features soften her eyes become more sane and aware
why do you have so many scars
who hurt you so badly
dont hardly remember maam
coffey sits on the edge of the bed
the lights seem to flare hotter and brighter
tears are forming in melindas eyes
whats your name
john coffey maam
like the drink only not spelt the same
she lays back staring at him with shining fascination
the world seems to be slowing down growing very still indeed
and he starts bending slowly toward her
yes john coffey
i see it
i see it
he comes closer
you be still now
you be so quiet and so still
he brushes her forehead with his lips
the gentlest whisper of a kiss
then moves his mouth down to hers
for a moment we can see one of her eyes staring past him filling with an expression of surprise
and then her face is lost to view as coffey puts his lips on hers
we hear a soft whistling sound as he begins inhaling the air deeply from her lungs
something hot and glowing starts passing between them drawn on his breath
the men watch
the house seems to shudder in that moment as if the entire world has shifted an inch to the right
and the grandfather clock stops ticking the pendulum stopping dead the glass face cracking neatly up the center
and a windowpane cracks
a picture falls off the wall
a lightbulb bursts showering glass
paul smells smoke realizes the fringed coverlet of the bed has caught fire
moving like a man in a dream he reaches for the waterglass on the nightstand douses the flames
coffey keeps kissing melinda in that deep and mysterious way inhaling and inhaling her hand held in his like a tiny white bird
for a moment we actually hear something screaming as if some willful imp were being extracted by force
and then its over
coffey raises his head revealing melindas beautiful face
her mouth no longer droops
color is coming back to her hair
her skin is shining with life
coffey regards her raptly for a moment or two then starts coughing violently
he turns away and drops to his knees hacking like a man in the last stages of tuberculosis
paul and his men are expecting coffey to spit out the bugs but he doesnt he just keeps coughing deep and hard barely finding time to snatch in the next
breath of air
hal goes to his wife beyond stunned sits at her side
she looks back at him with amazement her face like a dirty mirror thats been suddenly wiped clean
johns coughing grows even worse
brutal drops to his side and slaps his broad spasming back
sick it up
cough em out like you done before
coffey just keeps retching eyes watering from the strain spit flying from his mouth
whatever he sucked out of her hes choking on it
paul starts toward them
coffey crawls away pressing himself into a corner with his face against the wallpaper
hes still making gruesome deep hacking sounds but getting it under control
he weakly waves paul off let me be
paul looks to the bed
hal sits with melinda stroking her brow
color is blooming in her cheeks even as we watch
how did i get here
we were going to the hospital in indianola werent we
we stopped and you bought me a packet of posies
it doesnt matter
it doesnt matter anymore
did i have the x ray
did i yes
they both look at him
it was clear
there was no tumor
hal bursts into tears
melinda sits up comforting him
her eyes are drawn to the corner
who is that man
coffey is struggling to rise
brutal does his best to help
can you turn around
can you turn around and see this lady
his face is ashen gray seriously ill
whats your name
john coffey maam
like the drink only not spelled the same
not spelt the same at all
she pushes the covers aside to rise
hal tries to stop her
but she pushes his hand gently aside
hal watches in wonder as she stands takes a first tentative step
and walks to coffey
she gazes up and touches his face
i dreamed of you
i dreamed you were wandering in the dark and so was i
we found each other
we found each other in the dark
she undoes her necklace holds it up for him
he hesitates glances to paul
paul nods its all right
coffey lowers his head
melinda affixes the delicate chain around his neck
i want you to have it mr
coffey and wear it
hell keep you safe
please wear it for me
thank you maam
thank you john
her arms go around his neck hugging him tightly as if she might never let go
paul and the men hustle coffey out the front door toward the truck helping him as best they can
hes weak as a baby knees threatening to give out at any moment
cmon john stay on your feet
christ he goes down well need three mules and a crane to pick him up again
they get coffey to the truck and throw their backs into it helping him crawl up onto the stakebed
he rolls over on his back
harry hops up covers him with an old blanket
brutal pulls aside speaking low hell never sit in old sparky
you know that dont you
off pauls look he swallowed that stuff for a reason
i give him a few days
one of usll be doing a cell check and there hell be
dead on his bunk
if thats his choice hes earned it
beat lets get him back on the mile
coffey on the mile dean starts babbling with relief as they return am i glad to see you
you were gone so long
wild bills making noises like hes gonna wake up
notices coffey what the hells wrong with him
hes hurting dean
dean jumps in helps them steer coffey into his cell
john were gonna set you on your bunk now
coffey nods sits heavily on the bunk
he lowers his head breath rasping like a rusted hinge
the guards step out
what about mrs
was it like the mouse
was it a
yes it was
paul scans their faces
smiles are traded
an exultant beat
i think we got away with it
we still gotta convince a certain somebody to keep his trap shut
get his stuff
dean hurries off to retrieve percys holster and baton
brutal unlocks the restraint room door swings it open
percy is revealed sitting against the wall glaring his mouth still taped
paul crouches down
brutal joins him
i want to talk not shout
i take the tape off you gonna be calm
paul takes hold of the tape preparing to yank
my mother always said if you do it fast it wont hurt so much
paul rips the tape off
percys eyes water with pain
i guess she was wrong
get me out of this nut coat
in a minute
right n paul slaps him hard knocks him sideways
percy looks up blinking in surprise
paul grabs him yanks him back up
you shut up and listen
you deserved to be punished for what you did to del
youll accept it like a man or well make you sorry you were ever born
well tell people how you sabotaged dels execution sabotaged
and how you pissed yourself like a frightened little girl
yes well talk thats a given but percy mind me now
well also see you beaten within an inch of your life
percy blinks unable to grasp that
we know people too are you so foolish you dont realize that
people with friends and loved ones doing time in this prison
people whod be happy to amputate you nose or your penis just so someone they care about could get an extra three hours in the exercise yard every week
off percys look let bygones be bygones
nothings hurt so far but your pride
and nobody need ever know about that except the people in this room
what happens on the mile stays on the mile
a long pause
softly may i be let out of this coat now
they pull him to his feet undo the straps
he shrugs out of the straitjacket and adjusts his clothes trying to maintain a shred of dignity
dean hands them over
percy smooths his hair and puts his hat on starts strapping on his holster belt
think it over percy
oh i intend to
i intend to think about it very hard
starting right now
percy exits the restraint room
brutal whispers to paul hell talk
sooner or later
paul nods with weary resignation yeah i know
percy pauses near coffeys cell careless as always getting his holster buckled and a massive black arm grabs him through the bars
his scream brings paul and the others from the restraint room
coffeys face is pressed so tight between his bars it looks like hes trying to push his head through
he draws his lips back baring his teeth in an awful sneer
percy whacks him with his baton
coffey barely seems to feel it
he curls his free hand around the back of percys head pulling him ever closer
and percys screams are muffled as their mouths come together
coffey begins exhaling as if hed held his breath for hours
percy jerks like a fish on a hook but cant get away
the men jump in try to pry percy loose hollering for coffey to let him go
the black insects are flowing from coffey to percy swirling into his mouth up his nose down his throat
several lightbulbs explode in their steel cages up and down the mile
percys baton drops from his nerveless fingers and clatters to the floor never to be picked up again
and then coffey steps back rubbing his mouth as if hes tasted something bad
the color has returned to his skin
percy however is ashen gray
his expression is blank as a sheet of paper not a trace of awareness in his eyes
the men are stunned
paul raises his hand to percys face snaps his fingers
he tries again clapping loudly
percy reacts slightly eyes fluttering swaying a bit
you all right
percy says nothing
he turns and walks slowly up the mile his movements vacant and disjointed
he comes to a swaying stop at wild bills cell
and turns slowly to look in
wild bill is coming painfully around groggily clutching his head
he looks up see percy
whata you looking at you limp noodle
you wanna kiss my ass or suck my dick
nothing for the longest moment
percy just staring
and then he pulls his gun and empties it into wild bill as fast as he can pull the trigger
bill takes all six rounds in the chest reeling back across the cell
he hits the wall and slides down leaving a smear his face registering a final look of stunned surprise
paul and the other tackle percy and bring him down wrestling the gun out of his hand
dean is almost weeping oh god oh god no
percy is flat on his back staring up at nothing
the black bugs come drifting out of nose and mouth swirling in the air over his head
they turn white and disappear
the men are speechless
paul turns sees coffey sitting on the floor at his bars watching
punished them bad men
why wild bill
i saw in his heart
when he grab my arm i saw what wild billy done
saw plain as day
cant hide whats in your heart
coffey reaches toward him straining through the bars
take my hand boss
you see for yourself
paul hesitates torn between reason and coffeys pleading eyes
a whisper my hand
paul cant help it
he has to
their hands come together
paul lurches wildly as that circuit starts blazing between them
gots to boss
gots to give you a little bit of myself
a gift like
a gift of whats in me so you can see
and paul sees the detterick twins
kathe and cora
laughing and playing hopscotch in the dust under a later afternoon sun
a dinner table
family having supper late in the day basket of biscuits being passed
twelve year old howie detterick taking it passing it on
an hand with a paint brush slopping bright red paint on the side of a barn
kathe skipping to the head of the hopscotch squares turning and starting back laughing in the sun
the paint brush slopping more paint dripping like blood
paul jerks and twists trying to pull away trying to break the circuit but he cant not till all is seen and done marjorie detterick calling from the porch for
everybody to come eat suppers ready
a hammer pausing
klaus looking down from atop the barn
the detterick twins finishing their hopscotch gathering their jump ropes from the dust running across the yard
the basket of biscuits being passed to little cora who takes a biscuit and passes it on
klaus coming down the ladder calling to his daughters
the little girls running past the man with the paint brush who turns and smile as they go by
its wild bill
the basket of biscuits is passed one last time
a hand pulls one out raises it for a bite
its wild bill smiling at the little girls as conversation flows around the table
paul screams trying to pull away but the porch door is kicked off its hinges just before dawn a figure looming in the doorway
kathe wakes her scream cut short as the mans fist punches her hard in the face
paul trembles violently as if riding the lightning himself pleading for it to stop but theres one last thing wild bill looms over the terrified little girls like a horrendous
boogeyman whispers to kathe you lover your sister
you make any noise know what happens
ill kill her instead of you
to cora and if you make any noise ill kill her
and he drags them out into the coming dawn
as coffey lets paul go
paul is gasping back in the real world where his men are staring at him with wide eyes
he kill em with they love
they love for each other
you see how it is
paul nods numb
tears are flowing down coffeys face
softly thats how it is ever day
thats how it is all over the worl
lies dead staring with glassy eyes
a flashbulb pops rimming him with harsh blue light
as hal arrives wearing his pajama top under his overcoat
he sees the police photographer taking pictures
the guards are giving statements to groups of cops everybody murmuring well i dunno he just snapped i guess
sright one minute hes fine the next blammo
bastard grabbed him through the bars a few days back scared the boy so bad he wet himself
hal turns sees sits handcuffed on the floor of the mile eyes glassier than wild bills
two cops are trying to snap him out of it son
can you hear me
speak up if you can hear us
we gotta ask you some questions
a medic is raising percys eyelid with his thumb shining a penlight getting no reaction
i think this boys cheese slid off his cracker
sees paul motions him aside to talk privately ill cover you as much as i can even if it mean my job but i have to know
does this have anything to do with what happened at my house
does it paul
paul looks hal in the eye
as with bitterbuck the lie comes easy no
tracking a pair of feet shuffling into the room in hospital slippers escorted by two orderlies
the patient is brought to a window
the orderlies turn to leave
and we boom up to reveal percy catatonic staring out the same window where we met wild bill
and we widen slowly from percy at the window to reveal his last stop in life
its emblazoned on the gate briar ridge mental hospital
he finally got that transfer
tight on paul as softly it makes sense
i read the file
hal even said it himself
wharton rambled all over the state last few years causing trouble
hell longer than that
been at it since he was ten
angle shifts to include jan brutal harry and dean
theyre in the brambly patch that borders the woods behind the house
the sun is setting turning the horizon fiery
you saw him
you actually saw this wild bill person take those girls
their father hired him on for a few days last spring help repair the barn
cheap labor just another drifter
sick bastard came back a month later just before dawn
took the girls
did what he did
coffey found them afterwards and tried to help
it was too late
absorbs this then you can stop it
the execution i mean
get coffey a new trial
based on what honey
some kind of magical vision i had
show this farmer whats his name detterick
show him a picture of wild bill
off their looks why not
if wharton was there
if the farmer can identify his picture and they know he was there
him being there in may doesnt mean he came back and killed those girls in june
even if he was committing other crimes
they got their killer as far as theyre concerned
hell coffeys own lawyer would come throw the switch if we let him
tell them wharton confessed to the crime
brutus you can back him up say you heard it too
you can say thats what set percy off
he shot wharton because he couldnt stand thinking of what happened to those two little girls it snapped his mind
seeing their looks what
we never reported anything like that
we wouldve too everybody knows it
its part of our job
besides confessing dont make it so
slugs like wild bill lie about everything
crimes they committed women they had even the weather
but he was there
he painted their barn
he ate dinner with them
all the more reason he might take credit for the crime
hes gonna fry anyway so why not boast
jan stands thinking for a moment then all right
then youve got to get john coffey out on your own
you did it once didnt you
only this time dont bring him back
dean blinks stunned by this notion
gently maam your sons grown up and moved away
my kids are just starting kindergarten
will you be the one to explain to them why their daddys in prison
work out a plan
make it look like a real escape
better be a plan an imbecile could dream up
nobodyd believe it otherwise
even if we did think of something it wouldnt do any good
just why the hell not
because hes a six foot eight inch baldheaded black man with barely enough brains to feed himself
how long you think itd be before he was recaptured
jan swipes a tear away with the heel of her hand
softly do you mean to kill him you cowards
paul tries to take her hand
she wrenches away furious
dont touch me
next week this time youll be a murderer no better than that man wharton so dont touch me
she runs off toward the house starting to sob as we paul is at the kitchen table in the wee hours at his regular place sipping his beer
irving berlins remember plays softly on the radio
jan comes down looking miserable and exhausted
im so sorry i called you a coward
i feel worse about that than anything ive ever said to you in our whole marriage
even that time we went camping and you called me old stinky sam
she cant help smiling at that
he returns the smile offers her a sip of beer
she takes it sits
does hal know
that coffeys innocent i mean
paul shakes his head can he help
does he have the influence to do something about this
then dont tell him
if he cant help dont tell him
beat theres no way out of this for you is there
ive been thinking about it too believe me
beat tell you the truth honey
ive done some things in my life im not proud of but this is the first time ive ever felt in real danger of hell
touches his face talk to him
talk to john
find out what he wants
coffey sits quietly in his cell a solitary firefly flitting in circles around his finger
paul and the men appear
the firefly flits away vanishing through coffeys tiny window
brutal unlocks his cell
i guess you know were coming down to it now
another couple of days
beat is there anything special youd like for dinner that night
we can rustle you up most anything
coffey gives it some careful thought
meatloaf be nice
mashed taters with gravy
is not picky
what about a preacher
someone you could say a little prayer with
dont want no preacher
you can say a prayer if you want
i could get kneebound with you i guess
coffey gives him a look please
spose i could if it came to that
paul sits working himself up to it john i have to ask you something very important right now
i know what you gonna say
you don have to say it
i do have to
beat john tell me what you want me to do
you want me to take you out of here
just let you run away
see how far you can get
why would you do such a foolish thing
paul hesitates emotions swirling trying to find the right words
on the day of my judgement when i stand before god and he asks me why did i kill one of his true miracles what am i gonna say
that is was my job
you tell god the father it was a kindness you done
takes his hand i know you hurtin and worryin i can feel it on you but you oughtta quit on it now
because i want it over and done
coffey hesitates now hes the one trying to find the right words trying to make paul understand im tired boss
tired of bein on the road lonely as a sparrow in the rain
tired of not ever having me a buddy to be with or tell me where wes coming from or going to or why
mostly im tired of people being ugly to each other
im tired of all the pain i feel and hear in the world ever day
theres too much of it
its like pieces of glass in my head all the time
can you understand
by now paul is blinking back tears
softly yes john
i think i can
there must be something we can do for you john
there must be something you want
coffey thinks about this long and hard finally looks up
i aint never seen me a flicker show
gazing with wide eyed open mouthed wonder the light of a motion picture projector flickering on his skin
while fred astaire and ginger rogers dance up there on the big screen images flowing in magical black and silver tone
singing heaven im in heaven
and my heart beats so that i can hardly speak
paul and the men are scattered about in the otherwise empty auditorium also watching
toot operates the projector peering through the tiny window into the theater
he yawns glances at his watch
fred and ginger are now in the most passionate and graceful part of the dance
irving berlins music swells
cant believe what hes seeing
hes so excited his breath is caught in his throat
softly why theys angels
just like up in heaven
four pairs of feet come marching up the green mile
paul appears at the bars with brutal harry and dean
nothing is said
coffey knows why theyre here
he rises as brutal unlocks the cell slides the door open
coffey steps out looks around at their dazed and sad faces
i be all right fellas
this heres the hard part
i be all right in a little while
paul indicates st
christopher medal around johns neck john i should have that just for now
ill give it back after
john lets him take the necklace
paul pockets it
they start to walk the mile as you know i fell asleep this afternoon and had me a dream
i dreamed about dels mouse
did you john
i dreamed he got down to that place boss howell talked about that mouseville place
i dreamed there was kids and how they laughed at his tricks
he laughs at the memory of it then grows more serious i dreamed those two little blonde headed girls were there
they us laughing too
i put my arms around em and sat em on my knees and there us no blood comin outta their hair and they us fine
we all watch mr
jingles roll that spool and how we did laugh
fit to bus we was
behind them dean stifles a sob
paul joins him self conscious and uncertain
what should we pray for john
paul nods strength it is
dean surprises brutal and harry by also kneeling
brutal and harry hesitate
then join them
god please help us finish what weve started and please welcome this man john coffey like the drink but not spelled the same into heaven and give him peace
please help us to see him off the best we can and let nothing go wrong
paul starts to rise but coffey takes his hand
i know a prayer i once heard
can i say it
you go right ahead john
take all the time you need
coffey closes his eyes frowning in deep concentration
baby jesus meek and mild pray for me
and paul sees kathe and cora detterick kneeling together in the enclosed porch that night just before their bedtime and every child
be my strength be my friend
and then the vision is gone as be with me until the end
coffey rises offers paul his hand helps him up
full house tonight
bill dodge is waiting at old sparky
silence as coffey is led in all eyes on him
klaus and marjorie detterick are in the front row
she mutters die slow you bastard
is faltering as paul and brutal bring him to the chair
theys a lot of folks here hate me
i can feel it
like bees stinging me
feel how we feel then
we dont hate you can you feel that
coffey tries to take comfort in it but flinches as kill him twice you boys
you go on and kill that raping baby killer twice thatd be fine
she dissolves into tears
klaus pulls her against his shoulder looking dazed by the whole thing
paul and brutal turn john around sit him down
paul notices dean crying again his back to the witnesses
they kneel to apply the leg clamps while brutal and harry secure the arms
wipe you face before you stand up dean
dean nods wiping his face with the sleeve of his coat
they rise stepping back
this time pauls out front roll on one
van hay cranks the generator
the lights flare hotter and brighter
its just like in melindas bedroom the night coffey cured her with a kiss
airless and bright dreamlike
does it hurt yet
i hope it does
i hope it hurts like hell
you have been condemned to die in the electric chair by a jury of your peers
sentence imposed by a judge in good standing in this state
do you have anything to say before sentence is carried out
john hesitates nods
im sorry for what i am
you ought to be
oh you monster you damn well ought to be
brutal takes the mask from the hook to draw it over coffeys head
coffey looks to paul with terrified pleading eyes
please boss dont put that thing over my face
dont put me in the dark is afraid of the dark
all right john
brutal puts the mask back proceeds with the sponge
the cap is lowered the straps drawn
coffey is breathing fast terrified muttering under his breath heaven
im in heaven
sit and wait barely breathing
is poised at the switch wondering why the order wont come
is staring at coffey unable to say the words
you have to say it
you have to give the order
he reaches out and touches coffeys hand
their fingers clasp
in that moment staring into his eyes paul hears the last thought that ever goes through coffeys head whispered v
he kill em with they love
thats how it is ever day
all over the worl
their fingers disengage
paul steps back eyes still locked with coffeys and says the hardest words hes ever spoken roll on two
van hay throws the switch
coffey surges forward fingers splayed and jittering past old sparkys arms
lights begin blowing out all over the mile raining shattered glass and sparks
some of the witnesses scream
a thin line of blood comes trickling out of klaus dettericks nose
he reaches up absently wipes it away
coffeys eyes are locked on pauls riding the lightning all the way
he finally slumps
van hay kills the current
coffeys expression is peaceful as if sleeping
a final pair of tears drift gently down his cheeks
paul ever so carefully replaces the st
christophers medal around coffeys neck
they wheel him down the tunnel
paul drives home his heart numb
paul pulls in cuts the engine
he sits for a moment then gets out and heads for the house
the door opens
jan steps out in her nightgown and robe to meet him on the stairs
she takes him in her arms
paul cant hold it back anymore
he breaks down sobbing against her as we its late in the day as that was the last execution i ever took part in
just couldnt do it anymore after that
we both transferred out took jobs with boys correctional
beat nods that was all right
catch em young that became my motto
might even have done some good
angle shifts to elaine listening
you dont believe me
i dont imagine you would lie to me paul
its just that
its quite a story
quite a story
pause one thing i dont understand
you said you and jan had a grownup son in
is that right
paul nods but if thats true
the math doesnt work does it
she shakes her head
paul thinks for a moment comes to a decision
you feel up to a walk
the rain has mostly stopped
brad dolan back in street clothes gets in his pickup truck and drives away
while paul and elaine watch from a window
this time we see two red specks trudging slowly up the ridge toward the treeline
paul brings elaine along the wooded path into view of the storage shacks
theyre both wearing ponchos
its in there
this thing you want to show me
is it scary
he gives her a smile offers his hand
she takes it
we see paul approach through the grimy window as before this time bringing elaine
angle shifts to the door as they arrive creaking open on rusty hinges to reveal them
elaine looks around at the musty nooks and crannies wondering what theyre doing here
paul touchers arm directs her attention there
elaine moves closer sees it on the dusty floorboards an old cigar box
for a moment she doesnt know what to make of it
wake up old boy
elaines breath catches in her throat
as a pair of bright oilspot eyes peer over the edge of the cigar box
its a mouse
his fur once brown is now all gray
it cant be
paul gets down on the floor holds out his hand
come over here boy
come on over her and see this lady
the mouse tries several times to get over the side of the cigar box before he finally makes it
he comes to them hobbling and crippled with arthritis
paul pulls a slice of toast from his pocket breaks off a small piece for the mouse
that cant be mr
paul says nothing just pulls a spool from his pocket
jingles might be old but hes as obsessed as ever
he gets ready to fetch eyes riveted to the spool
softly messieurs et mesdames
beinvenue au cirque du mousie
paul tosses the spool
the mouse limps painfully after it
he reaches it goes around
and has to lay down to catch his breath
elaine starts forward but paul holds her back
after a moment mr
jingles finds his feet again
he rises and starts nosing the spool back to paul
dont make him do it again
i cant bear to watch
softly but he loves it so much
he glances around at the shack with a sad smile
this isnt exactly the mouseville we had in mind
but we make do dont we old fella
as i live and breathe
they gasp and spin
brad dolan stands in the doorway
fooled you didnt i got yourself a little love nest here i see
he pauses seeing mr
what the fuck
is that a mouse
dont hurt him okay
its a goddamn mouse yold fool they carry all kinda disease
brad grabs an old garden hoe the blades rusted but still sharp enough to cut a mouse in two
now step aside
paul rushes in front of brad fists clenched yelling you leave him alone percy
you leave him alone or by god ill brad gives paul a hard shove pins him against the wall
who you calling percy
names brad you senile fucker
and im gonna nail that mouse you can take that to the everfucking bank
elaine is suddenly at brads elbow seething with fury how dare you
piss off you wrinkeldy old bitch
me and paulie are talking
his name is mr
if you ever call him paulie again your days of employment at georgia pines will end
who the hell you think you are
i am the grandmother of the man who is currently speaker of the georgia house of representatives
a man who loves his relatives mr
all it would take is a phone call
brads smile falters
elaine steps closer
at first i thought id let you be
im old and that seemed easiest
but when my friends are threatened and abused i do not let it be
icy beat now get out or you wont work another day here
not another hour
i swear it
brad eases his grip on paul
and backs off
dont know what youre getting so het up about
just a damn mouse
get out you ignorant man
what little mind you have is ugly and misdirected
brad flushes red heads for the door
dont bother coming back here tomorrow
edgecomb gonna be a new lock on this door
this is off limits to residents no matter what mrs
my shit dont stink has to say about it
and off he goes
paul tries to control the shaking in his hands looks to elaine
little trick i learned from percy wetmore
is your grandson really speaker of the house
paul bends down picks mr
you gonna thank the lady
she just saved your old mousie hide
the mouse stretches his neck forward nose twitching smelling pauls breath
paul looks to elaine
softly i think mr
jingles happened by accident
i think when we electrocuted del and it all went so badly
well john could feel it you know
and i think a tiny part of whatever was inside of him just leapt out
beat me i was no accident
john had to give me a little part of himself
a gift like
so i could see for myself what wild bill had done
when john did that a part of whatever power worked through him spilled into me
infected you with life
paul looks at the mouse strokes him gently between the ears
thats as good a word as any
he infected us both didnt he mr
beat im a hundred and five years old elaine
i was forty the year john coffey walked the green mile
oh my god
camera pushes slowly in on paul as i havent even had a cold since
ive had to watch my friends and loved ones die off through the years
hal and melinda
beat and you elaine
youd die too and my curse is knowing ill be there to see it
paul dressed in a dark suit comes up the aisle
angle shifts to reveal elaine connelly lying in the open casket
thats my punishment you see
my punishment for letting john coffey ride the lightning
for killing a miracle of god
paul lays a rose atop the casket
youll be gone like all the others and ill have to stay
paul stands at the graveside as the casket is lowered
ill die eventually i imagine
i have no illusions of immortality
but i will have wished for death long before death finds me
he turns and walks away
in truth i wish for it already
empty and silent
young paul walks the mile alone listening to the quiet
he pauses seeing something
a whisper mr
it is mr
the little mouse is peering from under the restraint room door
hes come home looking bedraggled
paul bends down gently picks him up
where you been boy
ive been worried about you
paul turns and head back up the green mile carrying the mouse cupped in his hands as we young paul transforms into old paul in the dissolve the corridor of
the green mile becoming the corridor of the nursing home
hes walking along holding the little mouse the same way he did over sixty years ago
i lie in bed most nights thinking about it
and i wait
paul lies awake staring at the moon outside his window
i think about all the people ive loved now long gone
i think about my beautiful jan and how i lost her so many years ago
i think about all of us walking our own green mile each in our own time
but one thought more than any other keeps me awake most nights
beat if he could make a mouse live so long how much longer do i have
he looks over at the nightstand
we each owe a death there are no exceptions but sometimes oh god the green mile is so long
and we pan to reveal mr
