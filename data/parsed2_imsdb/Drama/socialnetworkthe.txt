written by aaron sorkin may did you know there are more people with genius iqs living in china than there are people of any kind living in the united states
that cant be true
it is true
what would account for that
well first of all a lot of people live in china
but heres my question mark zuckerberg is a sweet looking year old whose lack of any physically intimidating attributes masks a very complicated and dangerous anger
he has trouble making eye contact and sometimes its hard to tell if hes talking to you or to himself
erica also is marks date
she has a girl next door face that makes her easy to fall for
at this point in the conversation she already knows that shed rather not be there and her politeness is about to be tested
the scene is stark and simple
how do you distinguish yourself in a population of people who all got on their sats
i didnt know they take sats in china
i wasnt talking about china anymore i was talking about here
you can sing in an a capella group
does that mean that you actually got nothing wrong
or you row crew or you invent a dollar or you get into a final club
or you get into a final club exactly
i like guys who row crew
well i cant do that
and yes it means i got nothing wrong on the test
have you ever tried
im trying now
to row crew
to get into a final club
to row crew
are you like whatever crazy
sometimes mark seriously you say two things at once and im not sure which one were talking about
but youve seen guys who row crew right
theyre bigger than me
theyre world class athletes
and a second ago you said you like guys who row crew so i assumed youd met one
i guess i meant i liked the idea of it
the way a girl likes cowboys
the phoenix is good
this is a new topic
its the same topic
were still talking about the finals clubs
would you rather talk about something else
its just that since the beginning of the conversation about finals clubs i think i may have had a birthday
we can change the subject
cant get over it there are more people in china with genius iqs than the entire population of its about exclusivity
the final clubs
and thats how you distinguish yourself
the phoenix is the most diverse
the fly club roosevelt punched the porc
the porcellian the porc its the best of the best
i actually meant which roosevelt
okay well which is the easiest one to get into
mark takes a cigarette from a pack lights it takes a drag and blows the smoke out before he says
why would you ask me that
i was just asking
theyre all hard to get into
my friend eduardo made betting on oil futures last summer and he wont get in
money or the ability to make it doesnt impress anybody around here
everybody can do that
he made in a summer
he likes meteorology
you said it was oil futures
if you can predict the weather you can predict the price of heating oil
you asked me that because you think the final club thats easiest to get into is the one where ill have the best chance ive lost my place again
you asked me which one was the easiest to get into because you think thats where i have the best chance
the one thats easiest to get into would be the one where anybody had the best chance
i just think you asked the placement of where you asked the question i was honestly just asking
i was asking just to ask
mark im not speaking in code
erica youre obsessed with the finals clubs
you have finals clubs ocd and you need to see someone about this wholl prescribe some sort of medication
you dont care if side effects may include blindness okay just do it
not finals clubs and theres a difference between being obsessed and being motivated
yes there is
well you do that was cryptic so you do speak in code
i didnt mean to be cryptic
im saving i need to do something substantial in order to get the attention of the clubs
because theyre exclusive
and fun and they lead to a better life
you think teddy roosevelt got elected president because he was a member of the phoenix club
he was a member of the porcellian and yes i do
maybe he sang in an a capella group
i want to be straight forward and tell you that i think you should be a lot more supportive
if i get in ill be taking you to the parties and youll be meeting people that you wouldnt normally get to meet
you would do that for me
youre my girlfriend
okay well i want to be straight forward and tell you that im not anymore
what do you mean
im not your girlfriend anymore is this a joke
no im sorry its not
youre breaking up with me
youre going to introduce me to people i wouldnt normally get to meet
what the fuck is that supposed to mean
take it easy
what was it supposed to mean
it was erica the reason were able to sit here and drink is that you used to sleep with the door guy
i want to really try not to lose it now
the door guys name is bobby
i havent slept with the door guy the door guys a friend of mine
hes a perfectly good class of people and what part of long island are you from england
im from westchester
im going back to my dorm
wait wait thisi reel
i apologize okay
im going back to my dorm i have to study
im sorry and i mean it
i appreciate that but come on
i have to study
you dont have to study
lets just talk
because its exhausting
going out with you is like dating a stairmaster
all i meant is that you go to b
and so youre not likely to i wasnt making a comment on your parents i was saying you go to b
i have to go study
you dont have to study
how do you know i dont have to study
because you go to b
erica stares at him
do you want to get some food
im sorry youre not sufficiently impressed with my education
and im sorry t dont have a rowboat
i think we should just be friends
i dont need friends
i was being polite i had no intention being friends with you
youre really leaving
erica takes marks hand and looks at him tenderly
listen youre going to be successful and rich
but youre going to go through life thinking that girls dont like you because youre a tech geek
and i want you to know from the bottom of my heart that that wont be true
itll be because youre an asshole
and with that stinger erica walks off and we stay on mark as the pulsing intro to paul youngs love of the common people calling over her shoulder and youre
never getting into a final club
along with the music we slowly push in on mark
a fuse has just been lit
semester as mark busts out of the bar past bobby the door guy and into the population of harvard square
as mark continues on he passes a group of people heading in the opposite direction for a party
as marks steady and determined stride continues hell
pass by all kinds of seemingly happy well adjusted socially adept people
the vocals from the paul young song come in as the music continues and mark busts into the lobby of his dorm
he doesnt look at anyone as he heads up the stairs and a bedroom thats part of a three bedroom suite
the music continues as mark walks in flicks his lap top on without looking at it and walks out of frame as we stay on the laptop
then a moment or two later a glass with ice gets set down next to the lap top
then a carton of orange juice followed by a bottle of vodka
marks fingers dance easily on the keyboard like a juilliard pianist warming up
in the exact time it takes him to pour the vodka and orange juice over ice the website hes just called up gets loaded onto the screen
com this is the only place hes comfortable
he begins blogging
erica albrightas a bitch
you think thats because her family changed their name from albrecht or do you think its because all b
u girls are bitches
he takes a good gulp of his drink
we see the words were hearing filling up his computer screen folks for the record she may look like a d but shes getting all kinds of help from our
friends at victorias secret shes a as in barely anything there
fresh ice gets dropped in the glass and a new drink poured
love of the common people continues
in back of mark sitting on the bed and hitting a bong is the truth is she has a nice face
i need to think of something to help me take my mind off her
easy enough except i need an idea
mark has moved his mouse to an icon on his desktop labeled kirkland facebook
he clicks and opens it
a menu of photos appear
he blogs again
im a little intoxicated im not gonna lie
so what if its not even pm and its a tuesday night
the kirkland facebook is open on my desktop and some of these people have pretty horrendous f acebook pics
billy olsons sitting here and had the idea of putting some of these girls faces next to pictures of farm animals and have people vote on whos hotter
well be cutting back here a lot in this sequence with the paul young song tying them together as we show mostly mos preparations under way for the hottest party
on campus tonight
we start on a good looking student fixing his tie in the bathroom mirror
he walks out of the bathroom and into the main area where hes immediately tossed a bottle of champagne by a similarly dressed student
we see that there are a couple of dozen other guys around
our guy takes the champagne bottle and sticks it on the bar which is being stocked by two sexy female uniformed bartenders
our guy walks past p
djs table where the dj is setting up his incredibly high end equipment
our guy trots down a set of mahogany and red carpet stairs opens a heavy door and looks out to the sidewalk
a bouncer in a tuxedo is standing by a velvet rope which is holding back three dozen students
the students are mostly women and the women are all dressed to catch a man
over all this we hear mark continuinga good call mr
i think hes on to something
year its on
im not gonna do the farm animals but i like the idea of comparing two people together
it gives the whole thing a very turing feel since peoples ratings of the pictures will be more implicit than say choosing a number to represent each persons hotness like
they do on hotornot
the first thing were going to need is a lot of pictures
unfortunately harvard doesnt keep a public centralized facebook so im going to have to get all the images from the individual houses that people are in
let the hacking begin
there are two more kids in the room with mark dustin moskowitz and chris
first u is kirkland
they keep everything open and allow indexes in their apache configuration so a little nget magic is all thats necessary to download the entire kirkland facebook
on the computer screen weve been seeing him download picture after picture of harvard girls
three coes dressed kill are talking bouncer
the bouncer o l up at two hand club me bers
the members give him the nod and the three coeds are some m let past the velvet rope
in to a party in full swing
the best and the brightest are checking out the hottest and the easiest
mark finishes another drink and gets back to his work
next is elliot
theyre also open but with no indexes on apache
i can run an empty search and it returns all of the images in the database in a single page
then i can save the page and mozilla will save all the images for me
moving right along
flying by at super speed on marrs computer screen have been commands and images that the rest of us cant possibly understand
girls are dancing with each other doing tequila shots with guys and laughing at jokes
over this we hear marks blog posts starting to cascade into lowell has some security
they require a username password combo and im going to go ahead and say they dont have access to main faa user database so they have no way of a
adams has no security but limits the for quincy im going to have to get a matching name and student i
combo and im in
all i have to insr ions and images fly across marks sereen dunster is intense
not only is there no public directory but theres no leverett is a little better
its slightly obnoxious that they only let you view one picture at a time and im not definitely necessary to break out the emacs and modify that pert script
and now anew guy walks into marks room
this is eduardo saverin a sweet looking brazilian sophomore who almost always wears a three piece suit
whats going on
eduardos here and hes going to have the key ingredient
whats going on
did you and erica split up
how did you know that
its on your blog
are you alright
i need you
im here for you
no i need the algorithm you used for the oil futures
are you okay
were ranking girls
to watch the bottom s heads explode
you think thats such a good idea
whats the algozithm
the club president is addressing the guests from the top of
one of the oldest one of the most exclusive clubs not just at harvard but in the world and i want to welcome you to this year s first eduardo
is writing an equation with a grease marker on the window
when the equations done it looks like this b ra give each
base rating of
at any time girl all has a rating r a and girl b has a rating r b
when any two girls are matched up there an expectation of which will win based on their current rating
tapping the window those expectations are expressed this way
lets write it
a few more attractive co eds get let in through the velvet rope
cut to t mark makes a few last key strokes and a new website comes up on the screen
mark makes a few more keystrokes and two pictures of two harvard girls come up on the screen
after a moment
the one on the left
mark clicks the girl on the left and another picture takes the place of the girl on the right
on the right
mary clicks the girl on the right while another picture takes the place of the girl on the left
still the right
who should we send it to first
who are you gonna send it to
marks made the link to e mail and hits send
just a couple of people
the question is who are they gonna send it to
the partys in its drunken stage
we move to a room where theres a co ed poker game underway with the girls smoking cigars ai bra and a couple of pairs of stockings are out on
the table as move through the poker room we see a computer behind one of the players
the computer is indicating that theres e mail
a player turns around and opens the e mail as the poker game and the party go on behind him
at it then he hits a
link and facemash opens
he looks to another player check this out
two male students at a laptop
the one on the left
on the right
a bunch of students around a computer
dozens of partiers are around the comp uter
shes my roommate
a bunch of students around the computer she will cut herself open if she gets a low score on this can somebody figure out how to bust the curve
a few students gathered at a computer on the left
on the right
this time just a single student in his pajamas as he looks at two pictures of girls side by side
and another single student voting and we should instantly know that this dorm room is different
its more modern and with less character and history than the others
a girl is at her computer and in the background is another girl we cant quite make out whos taking notes from a i extbook
oh shit to the other girl albright
we rack focus to the studying girl and see that its erica
he blogged about you
erica looks at her for a moment then gets up to look at her no you dont want to read it
erica ignores her roommate we see her mortification as she reads and at that moment three guys appear in her open doorway one of them wearing a padded bra over
his boston university sweatshirt
they lift separate and support
thanks for the tip
get the fuck out the three guys go on their drunken way as we slowly push in on erica whos frozen in her humiliation and then the left
as sets of photos go flying by on his computer screen
mark is staring at the chaos of activity hes
eated in the middle of the night
i wonder if maybe you
shouldnt shut it down before you get into trouble
mark ignores him as we pre lap a phone ringing and a man named cox is asleep next to his wife
its his phone thats ringing
cox wakes up and answers it into phone hello
at in the morning
a tired grad student who spends the night monitoring the campus computer system is looking at his computer
well theres a very unusual amount of traffic coming out of kirkland house
youre saying its unusual for in the morning
im saying it
would be unusual for mothers day
cox hangs up the phone
i have to go in
whats going on
harvards computer systems about to crash
pictures are flying by on marks computer when suddenly they freeze then an icon comes up telling him hes no longer connected to the internet
everyone is frozen silent for a moment
you dont think i do go see if its everybody
dustin chris and eduardo head out of the room
marx drains whats left of the vodka and lights a cigarette as the guys start coming back in the room
my computers frozen
unless its a coincidence i think this is us its not a coincidence
yeah its three years later and mark is sitting with his lawyers at a large conference table
mark is wearing a hoodie sweatpants and adidas flip flops a personal uniform that well come to understand
and while it may take us a while to notice it marks a different person in these flash forward scenes
still tortured and complicated but comfortable now with his own power
his lawyer is sy whos accompanied by some junior associates one of whom a pleasant pretty and professional young contemporary of marks named marylin well get to know
on the other side are eduardo and his lawyer gretchen also a
a mpanied by some associates
a stenographer is typing the recor
the room is glass on two sides and through the windows we can see the behemoths of silicon valley oracle sunmicrosystems google etc
gretchen is taking marks deposition
so you were called in front of the ad board
thats not what happened
you werent called in front of the administrative board
no back i mean thats back at the bar with erica albright
she said all that
that i said that stuff to her
i was reading from the transcript of her why would you even need to depose her
thats really for us to you think if i know she can make me look like a
jerk ill be more likely to settle right
why dont we stretch our legs a minute can we do that
its been almost three hours and frankly you did spend an awful lot of time embarrassing mr
zuckerberg with the girls testimony in the bar
im not embarrassed its just that she made a lot of that up
she was under oath
then i guess that would be the first time somebodys lied under oath
people are stretching and getting coffee and talking quietly
mark stays in his seat
marylin the attractive second year associate whos on marks legal team is still sitting too
about four seats down from mark
eight percent of the male population of harvard had been on it within two hours
eighty percent of the male population
the harvard crew is practicing on two man sculls
there are three boats that are running roughly even with each other and the two man crews are rowing with all theyve got
were gliding along with them in the water bring up the rate
two power in
they had open water after a hundred meters
i dont think were gonna catch em today
and we pull back to reveal that theres a fourth boat which is already five boat ngths ahead of the other three
the fourth boat is being crewed by cameron and tyler winklevoss identical twins who stepped out of an ad for abercrombie and fitch
they know that the others arent in their class and even though theyre highly competitive athletes they dont like showing anyone up least of all their teammates
is there anyway to make this a fair fight
we could jump out and swim
i think wed have to jump out and drown
im not willing to do that
what are we at three quarter power
lets drop down to a half
or you could row forward and i could row backward
id kick your ass
were genetically identical so biology and mathematics says wed stay in one place not allowing for the current or the wind
just row the boat
and the wini levoss twins kick into full gear and open up an even wider lead as we
two stacks of the crimson harvards student newspaper get dropped on the floor as tyler and cameron walk by their trays loaded with mountains of eggs and pancakes and carbs
everyone knows and loves them in this year old dining hall and they wave and shout to a few people and whisper to a couple of very pretty girls before
taking a seat next to divya narendra a nice looking indian student whose face is in a copy of the crimson
you guys hear about this
two nights ago a sophomore at kirkland crashed the computers
all of them
be crashed the whole system
tyler picks up a copy of the crimson and begins reading while his brother and divya keep talking
he set up a website where you vote on the hotness of female harvard undergrads
what were we doing that none of us heard about this
i dont know
rowing going to class studying
how much activity was there on this thing that he crashed the votes
there were hits
cam this guy hacked into the facebooks of seven houses in two hours
he set up the whole site in one night while he was drunk
how do you know he was du he was blogging simultaneously
im way ahead of you
this is our guy
its marx and his lawyers again but this time on the other side of the table are tyler and cameron dlvya and the
r lawyer gage whose family had first class seats on the mayflower
be back and forth between the two deposition rooms a lot for the record cameron winklevoss
w i n k l e vwo s s
camerons spelled the usual way
for the record tyler
tylers spelled the usual way and my last name is the same as my brothers
mark stands before a panel of administrators as well as cox the systems manager who was woken up in the opening sequence
zuckerberg this is an administrative board hearing
youre being accused of intentionally breaching security violating copyrights and violating individual privacy by creating the website www
youre also charged with being in violation of the universitys policy on distribution of digitized images
before we begin with our questioning youre allowed to make a statement
would you like to do so
ive you know ive apologized in the crimson to the abhw to fuerza latina and to any women at harvard who might have been insulted as i take it they
were by the things that have been said tome in the last week
as for any charges stemming from the breach of security i believe i deserve some sort of recognition from this ad board
i dont understand
you believe you deserve recognition
i pointed out some pretty gaping holes in your system
excuse me may i
zuckerberg im in charge of security for all computers on the harvard system
i can assure you of its sophistication and in fact it was that level of sophistication that led us to you in less four hours
that would be impressive except the algorithm i used was written on my dorm room window
keep up the great work
as the heavy wooden door from the hearing slams shut behind mark
eduardo is waiting for him
six months academic probation
they walk out onto it could have been worse
no it couldnt
they made me apologize
over and over
i shouldnt have said the thing about the farm animals
that was stupid
everybodys mad at me now
maybe but at least everybody knows you now
marx is in his operating systems class
this is considered the hardest class at harvard and mark is one of the students with their laptops open as the professor takes them through an impossibly difficult lesson so
lets look at a sample problem suppose were given a computer with a bit virtual address and a page size of bytes
a girl scribbles something on a piece of paper
then hands it to the student next to her and nods that it should be passed over to mark
while thats happening the system uses one level page tables which start at address x
maybe you want to have dma
on your bit system who knows
the first few pages are reserved for hardware flags etc
mark opens the note
it reads asshole
he looks over and sees a couple of girls looking at him with contempt
assume page table entries have eight status bits
mark closes his laptop gets up and starts to head out of the hall
the eight status bits would be and i see we have our first surrender
dont worry mr
zuckerberi brighter men than you have tried and failed at this class
valid bit modify bit reference bit and permission bits
mark walks out of the lecture hall and we as mark comes out and heads onto the quad mark
cameron and tyler have been waiting by the entrance
are you mark
im cameron winklevoss
are you guys related
weve never heard that before
did i insult your girlfriends
what can i do for you
no you didnt insult our girl actually i dont know
we never asked
we should do that
no we have an idea we want to talk to you about
do you have a minute
you guys look like athletes
what do you do
we row crew
pause then smiles a little yeah ive got a minute
the most exclusive of all the final clubs
diivya is sitting in the main living room with a textbook open as the heavy wooden door opens and mark is escorted in by tyler and cameron
you ever been in the porcellian
we cant take you past the living room but we can sit here and talk
mark is stealing a glance around the room
this is divya narendra our partner
we were really impressed with facemash and then we checked you out and you also built coursematch
mark is looking at the framed black and white group pictures on the wall
of old porcellian classes
he sees a pretty co ed on the couch with her legs stretched over her boyfriend while they study
you go online you get to see what courses your friends are taking
and you invented something in high school
an app for an mp player that recognizes your taste in music
anybody try to buy it
how much did they pay
i didnt sell it
i uploaded it for free
mark gives a short shrug that says both i dont know and fuck you at the same time
n well weve been working for a while on an idea
its called harvardconnecti
you create your own page picture bio interests friends
people can see your bio and request to be yeah
hows this different from myspace or friendster
harvard dot e d u
the most prestigious e mail address in the country
this site would be based on the idea that girls want to meet guys who go to harvard
the difference between what were talking about and myspace is exclusivity right
we want you to be an equal partner
our first programmer graduated and went to work at google
our second programmer just got overwhelmed with school work
we want you to write the code and build the site and well provide im in
the winklevosses and divya with gage
thats what you said
it was three or four years ago i dont know what i said
eduardo with gretchen
when did you come to eduardo
i dont understand that question
do you remember answering in the affirmative
im asking when you came to eduardo with the idea for facebook
it was called thefacebook back then
this doesnt need to be that difficult
im in the middle of two different lawsuits
did you answer affirmatively
when tyler and cameron winklevoss and divya narendra asked you to build harvardconnection did you say yes
i said id help
when did you approach mr
saverin with the idea for thefacebook
i wouldnt say i approached him
you can answer the question
it was at a party at alpha epsilon pi
the jewish fraternity
it was caribbean night
the lecture hall has been converted into alpha epsilon pi caribbean night and the party is about as lame as it sounds
whats important is that this couldnt be less like the final club party we saw at the beginning if they were playing pin the tail on the donkey
some potted palm trees have brought in along with a steel drum set
the man playing the steel drum set has a yarmulke bobby pinned to his thinning hair
a table with a punch bowl and assorted cookies is nearby
rdo in baggy cargo shorts and a hawaiian shirt buttoned up to the top is standing with a few similarly dressed friends including dustin moskowitz and chris hughes in the
sparsely populated room
on the other side of the room are a few girls all asian
one of the girls is wearing a bikini over her clothes
a television monitor has been set up with a
dvd running of niagara falls
its not that guys like me are generally attracted to asian girls
its that asian girls are generally attracted to guys like me
im developing an algorithm to define the connection between jewish guys and asian girls
i dont think its that complicated
theyre hot theyre smart theyre not jewish and they cant dance
they see mark come in and look around
eduardo waves him over
mark sees eduardo and waves him over to where he is
he wants to talk privately
ill be back in a minute
eduardo joins mark in the back of the room and they take up a spot next to a bay window thats covered on the outside with ice
i think ive come up with something
hang on ive gotta tell you something youre not going to believe
i got punched by the phoenix
are you kidding
i mean its just the first of the four step process but they slipped the invitation under my door tonight
t go to the first punch party tomorrow and if they like me yeah
i get the second invitation and then the third and then who knows
you got punched by the phoenix
it was you know
im sure it was just a diversity thing and im never gonna make it in it was just a diversity thing
so ill just ride thathorse until what did you want to talk about
you said you think youve come up with something
it seems like marks just made a small decision in his head yeah
i think ive come up with something
its degrees outside
i dont want to stare at that loop of niagara falls which has absolutely nothing to do with the caribbean
mark and eduardo come outside and are immediately met by the freezing cold air
people came to facemash in a stampede right
it wasnt because i put up pictures of hot girls
you can go anywhere on the internet and see pictures of hot girls
it was because i put up pictures of girls that people knew
so if people want to go on the internet and check out their friends why cant i build a website that offers that
an online community of friends
pictures profiles whatever you can click into visit browse around
all from the privacy of your dorm room
im not talking about a dating site
im talking about taking the entire social structure of college and putting it online
i cant feel my legs
i know im totally pumped about this
it would be exclusive
it would be exclusive
youd have to know the people on the site to get in
like getting punched
this is interesting
like our own final club except not only can we get into this one were the president
i told him i thought it sounded great
i mean it did it was a great idea
there was no reason to hack people were going to put their own pictures up
what they were interested in what they were looking for what classes they were taking
and people had the ability to invite their friends to join
or put a different way not invite their friends to join
in a world where social structure is very important that was sexy
it was a big project and he was going to have to write tens ofathousands of lines of code so i wondered whyhe was coming to me and not his
dustin moskowitz and chris hughes were programmers
were gonna need a little start up cash to rentthe servers and get it online
that was why
did he offer business terms
well split it
for me and for you for putting up a thousand dollars and handling everything on the business end
youll be cfo
and you said
i said lets do it
did he add anything else
he said it probably was a
diversity thing but so what
why do you think he said that
gretchen whats the relevancy
this is discovery im trying to discover
theyre suggesting i was jealous of eduardo and began a plan to screw him out of the company
jealous of eduardo
stop typing were off the record
maam i know youve done your homework and so you know that money isnt a big part of my life but at the moment i could buy harvard university take
the phoenix club and turn it into my ping pong room
eduardos walking away and calls back to mark ill let you know how the party is we stay on mark for a moment longer his wheels turning eduardos in different
clothes and being questioned by gage
we recognize that youre a plaintiff in one suit involving facebook and a witness in another
yes sir at any time in the three weeks prior to mark telling you his idea did he mention tyler winklevoss cameron winklevoss divya narendra or harvardconnection
he said theyd asked him to work on their site but that hed looked at what they had and decided it wasnt worth his time
uhh he said even his most pathetic friends knew more about getting people interested in a website than these guys
these guys meaning my clients
he resented mark resented that they that your clients probably thought he would jump at the chance to rehabilitate his image after the facemash thing but mark didnt want to
with facemash hed beaten the harvard computers hed beaten the ad board and he made the girls mad
facemash did what he wanted it to do
mark kind of nods a little to himself
it should be noted that these depositions have an extra element of dish ort as everything is being said within a few feet of the peop being talked about
were you aware that while mr
zuckerberg was building thefacebook he was also communicating with the plaintiffs
not at the time i wasnt
i am now
were you aware that while mr
zuckerberg was building thefacebook he was leading the plaintiffs to believe he was building harvard connection
i have some problems with that question
no i wasnt
music kicks in that will tie this next section together as we two printouts of web pages are taped to a white board friendster and myspace
under the two pages mark draws a third page and titles it thefacebook
then he makes the decision to turn the capital t into a lower case t and it becomes thefacebook as we from mark zuckerberg to tyler winklevoss
i read over all the stuff you sent me re harvard connection and it seems like it shouldnt take too long to implement so we can talk about it after
i get all the basic functionality up tomorrow night
the whiteboard is filled with diagrams now under the heading thefacebook login page profile page create account we move over to see mark at his computer
he opens the emacs program and then firefox hits a few keys and the diagram on the whiteboard comes to life on his computer as we mark zuckerberg to cameron
sorry i was unreachable tonight
i just got about three of your missed
i was working on a problem set for my systems class
cameron and tyler are looking blankly at mark whos giving them a casual im not scared
ofayou look and we the music continues as eduardo and other prospective new members all wearing tuxedos are lined up in four rows
the boy at the front of each row has a bottle of jack daniels and drinks as long as they can before passing the bottle relay style to the boy
in back of him as a few seniors look on
eduardo gets handed the bottle and starts in as we its an art history class and as we run past the rows of students we see that they all have
the same painting up on their laptops as the professor gives his lecture
when we get to marks laptop we see that hes writing code for thefacebook
mark zuckerberg to cameron and tyler winklevoss
this week has been pretty busy thus far with classes and work so i think its probably best to postpone the meeting
cameron tyler and divya are reading the e mail
im also really busy tomorrow
anybody else feel like theres something up with this guy
tell him okay but weve gotta make sure we meet before we all head off for break
eduardos at his desk with his head in a thick textbook when an envelope that says phoenix is slipped under his door
be turns and looks to see it then pumps his fist in victory as every available wall space is covered with a diagram or a printout
eduardo comes in with the envelope
i need a dedicated linux box running apache webserver with a mysql backend
its gonna cost a little more money
how much more
two hundred more
do we need it
to handle the traffic
i already did
hey guess what
shows mark the envelope i made the second cut
you should be proud of that right there dont worry if you dont make it any further
ill get outa here
the music continuesa mark zuckerberg to tyler and cameron winklevoss and divya narendra
i have a cs problem set that im just getting started with and it should be about hours of coding so ill be busy tomorrow night
i wont really be free to meet until next wednesday afternoon
have to cancel wednesday afternoon
ive basically been in the lab this whole time and also
diaryas reading off his blackberry to tyler and cameron wont be able to do it saturday as i have to meet up with my parents to
the music continues its snowing and cold as hell
eduardos now with a smaller group of prospective members most of whom are in their underwear with a couple of them wearing pants
theyre all blue and shivering
theyre gathered around a statue of john harvard as a senior announces as the plaque reads this is john harvard founder of harvard university in
its also called the statue of three lies
what are the three lies
dowd the three lies shit
take your pants off
harvard was founded in not
harvard wasnt founded by john harvard and thats not john harvard
who is it
a friend of the sculptor daniel
chester you can
tpi your shirt on
and as another kid simply falls to his hands and knees and throws up we eduardos studying at his desk but this time wrapped in blankets and wearing gloves when
the envelope with phoenix gets slid under his door
days after mr
azuokerbergs initial meeting with my clients and he still hadnt completed work on harvardconnection
but on january a website called network solutions is up on marks screen
he hits a couple of keys and waits intently
then the computer shows him what he wanted to see www
com a domain name registered to the best of your knowledge had he even begun work on harvardconnection
not to my knowledge
camerons looking at his e mail
what in the hell is this
im still a little skeptical that we have enough functionality in the site to really draw the attention and gain the critical mass necessary to get a site like this
this is the first time he mentioned any problem
yes it was
youd sent e mails to mr
zuckerberg and received return e mails and this was the first time he had days to study our system and get out ahead on do you see any of your
code on facebook
did i use any of your code
you used our whole fuckin idea
match dot com for harvard guys
can i continue with my deposition
you know you really dont need a damn forensic team to get to the bottom of this
if you guys were the inventors of facebook youd have invented facebook
im just gonna stand over your shoulder while you write is a check
lets continue divxaa still staring at mark who just smiles a little as he looks down
february th mark is working at a station
we can see through the windows that its a frigid snowy february day in cambridge but mark in his hoodie and cargo shorts nonetheless
it looks like he hasnt slept in days
on his monitor we can see that hes working on the profile page for thefacebook
dustin moskowitz steps up to him quietly mark
marx turns his head and looks at him
theres a girl in the art history class that you take
her name is stephanie attic do you happen to know if she has a boyfriend
mark just keeps looking at him barely even blinking why am i being interrupted
i mean have you ever seen her with anyone
and if not do you happen to know if shes looking to go out with anyone
people dont walk around with a sign on them that says and mark stops short right there
because in his head hes just discovered the cure for cancer
as mark with his backpack stuffed comes flying out of the building and into the snow barely keeping his balance on the ice and we the heavy door bursts open
and mark comes busting through
he makes his way with speed and intent up a flight of stairs
and then another until he gets to his floor
he sprints down his hall toward his dorm room and barely notices eduardo leaning against the door
we were supposed to meet at
mark is searching the pockets of his shorts for his keys
have you slept yet
mark opens the door and they go into his suite i have to add a feature
what are you adding
marks in his own world as he sits at the computer and calls up thefacebook
the home page fills the screen
that looks good
that looks really good
its clean and simple
no flashing lights
the camera surveys the screen as mark slips through some functions to show eduardo and we see things that are now familiar a photo sex a profile a list of
attributes a poke application etc
mark cont t but watch
marks called up a the emacs program and quickly writes out several lines of code
whatd you write
mark goes back to the profile page
theres a new area to be filled in
relationship status interested in
these two things are what drive life at college
are you having sex or arent you
its why people take certain classes sit where they sit go where they go do what they do and at its um center you know thats what thefacebook is gonna
be about people are gonna log on because after all the cake and watermelon theres a chance theyre gonna meet a girl
and thats it
what do you mean
its ready that was it
and heres the masthead mark hits another couple of keystrokes and the websites masthead comes up
you made a masthead
eduardo saverin co founder and cfo
you have no idea how much thats going to mean to my father
sure i do
whens it gonna go live
get your laptop out
why do we need my laptop
because youve got e mails for everyone at the phoenix
im not sure if its gonna be cool with them that i spammed their its not spam
i didnt mean spam its not spam its if we send it to our friends itll just bounce around the computer lab i havent gotten in yet
these guys know people and these guys know girls
i need their e mails
eduardo takes out his laptop lets start with the president
jabberwockl e d u
like the lewis carrol
mark opens up an e mail and is writing a short message then includes a link to the site these guys
i know think theyre literary geniuses because the worlds most obvious lewis carroll reference is in their theyre not so bad
im just saying
he hits send
the sites live
you know what
lets go get a drink and celebrate
mark is staring at the computer
mark doesnt hear him
we just see marks head from the back and its ever so slightly bobbing back and forth
are you praying
the crocodillos harvards oldest male a capella group are singing at the front of the pub in their usual uniform of white tie and tails
incongruously but with surprisingly nice results the group is covering a song from the backstreet boys i want it that way and the pub full of students is loving it
we find a table in the back where divya is sitting with some of his friends who are having a nice time
divyas got his laptop open
when did the crocodillos start covering the backstreet boys
what happened to cole porter and irving berlin
its a valentines theme
theyre singing love songs
good point cause cole porter and irving berlin never wrote any love songs divya what are you reading
seven different people spammed me the same link
we see divya click his mouse on the link what is it
i dont know but im really hoping its video of kittens that look like the marx brothers cause i can never get enough file footage on my computer of animals
divya trails off
we slowly push in on his face as the blood starts draining away
i have to go
divya shuts his laptop grabs it off the table and starts to bolt out of the pub
his foot gets caught on a chair leg and he falls hard face first to the floor
he starts out again then comes back for his coat grabs it starts out and falls down all over again
finally hes got it together and flies out of the pub and we cameron and tyler are rowing in a large practice tank a simulator with a hull oars and
theyre focused and charging away in perfect sync when the door at the end of the century old boathouse opens and divya charges in from the co ld with his
laptop and a copy of the crimson in his hands
the twins are in the zone and dont pay any attention
not now weve got another meters
i just wanted to let you know zuckerberg stole our website
tyler stops rowing and then cameron
they look at divya
mark zuckerberg stole our website
its been live for over hours
theyre in gear
camerons taken a quick shower but didnt dry off
hes in sweatpants with a towel over his shoulder talking on the phone with his father and holding the crimson
divyas on his cell looking for mark and tyler still in his practice clothes has his desktop computer open to thefacebook and is studying it
i left a message with his r
i left two now im leaving one here
im looking at the article in the crimson
n a just tell him divya he knows who i am
clicks off phone and starts to dial another number asshole knows who i am
its titled hundreds register for new facebook website and then the sub headline is facemash creator seeks new reputation with latest online project
its me again
can you try looking for his roommates
their names are chris hughes and dustin moskowitz
no its todays paper it went online yesterday morning around
i dont have the slightest idea
covering the phone ty the lawyers on the phone with dad
im here with my brother tyler and our partner divya
reading off the computer welcome to thefacebook thefacebook is an online directory that connects people through social networks
you must have a harvard
edu address to register
i called earlier
im looking for mark zuckerberg
yes sir hes quoted a couple of times
i can read it says everyones been talking a lot about a universal
facebook within arvard he says he meaning mark i think its kind of silly that it would take the university a coupl e af years to get around to it
i can do a better than they can and i did in a week
could you leave word that divya narendra called i appreciate it
i know thats how he talks
off another copy of the as of yesterday evening zuckerberg said over students had registered to use thefacebook
he said he anticipated that students would have joined the site by this morning
yeah divya was just reading that hed signed up people on the first day
if i were a drug dealer i couldnt give free drugs to people in one day
and this kid doesnt have four friends
quieting them so he can hear guys please for just one second
thats what well do mr
were gonna put it all together right now and e mail it to you
you wont be able to get on the site yourself
a little uncomfortable
because you went to ohio state
but well take care of everything and well talk to you first thing in the morning
this is a whoa
and hes very bright and im sure he didnt mean to
do what he did
thank you very much and dad well talk to you in the morning too
cameron hangs up this is a good guy
we dont know that he
s not a good guy
we know that he took our idea and stole it
we know that he lied to
our faces for a month and a half while he he didnt lie to our faces
he never saw our
fine he lied to our e mail accounts and he got himself a day head start because he knows what apparently you dont which is that getting there first is
everythinal im a competitive racer div i dont think you need to school me on the importance of getting there first
that was your fathers lawyer on the phone with you
yeah well his in house counsel were gonna send him everything and hell look at it and if he thinks its appropriate hell send a cease and desist letter
a cease and desist letter doesnt have any teeth
you think we should hire lawyers and sue him
i think we should hire lawyers and have them beat him senseless with a crescent wrench
we dont have to do that
we can do it ourselves
im six five pounds and there are two of me
and im saying lets calm down until we know what were talking about
just how much more information are you waiting for
we met with mark three times we exchanged e mails we can prove that he looked at the code hed seen what victor had already done and we talked at
length about what we planned to do
the page looks the same what is that on the bottom
hes already seen it it says a mark zuckerberg production
on the home page
on every page
hang on cause i need a minute to let the classiness waft over me
he recites from the crimson thout having to read it they wr zuckerberg said that he hoped the prly options would help to restore his reputation following student outrage over
thats exactly what we said to him
hes telling us to go fuck ourselves
we know plenty of people at the crimson
while were waiting for dads lawyer to look this over we can at least no
get something going in the paper so that people know what
that this thing is in dispute
were not starting a knife fight in the crimson and were not suing anybody
cameron wants to answer the question but doesnt
beat referring to tyler hell say its stupid
because were gentlemen of harvard
this is harvard
you dont plant stories and you dont sue people
theres a right way to do things
you thought be was going to be the only one who thought that was stupid
during the time when you say you had this idea did you know that cameron and tyler carne from a family of means
a family of means
did you know that his father was wealthy
im not sure why youre asking me that
its not important that you be sure why im asking you
its not important to you
asking for help again sy
did you know that they came from money
i had no idea whether they came from money or not
in one of your e mails to mr
narendra you reference tate winklevoss consulting firm
if you say so
tate winklevoss founded the firm and its assets are in the hundreds of millions
or roughly the amount i paid in income tax last year go on
you also knew that cameron and tyler were members of a harvard final club called the porcellian
they made a point of pointing that out
excuse us for inviting you in
so its safe to say you were aware that my clients had money
me tell you why im asking
im wondering why if you needed a thousand dollars to start up your project you didnt ask my clients for it
theyd demonstrated to you an interest in this kind of thing so from that youre deducing that i didnt go to them because i didnt want them to know what
i was working on
i went to my best friend for the money because hes who i wanted to be partners with because of our similar vision and his superior business skills
eduardo was president of the harvard investors association and he was my best friend
your best friend is suing you for million dollars
i hadnt heard tell me more
eduardo what happened after the initial launch
im sorry sy would you mind addressing him as mr
theyre best friends gretchen
we just went through this on the nevermind
saverin what happened after the initial it exploded
everyone on campus was using it
facebook me was a common expression after two weeks
mark was the biggest thing on a campus that included nobel
laureates pulitzer prize winners two future olympians and a movie star
who was the movie star
does it matter
auditoriumi night the lamps in harvard yard light the snow falling
the seminal event for me was when he was in harvard square and picked up a copy of popular electronics magazine that ha the mits altair kit on the cover
theres a lower level and a balcony and both are full
mark and eduardo are sitting in the second to last row of the balcony
well hear the speaker but well only get to see him in a slightly blurry image as our attention is on mark and eduardo
and it was a clear day and i was up in my radcliffe dorm
and he brought that up there and said look its going to happen without us
weve got to do it now
and so i said
he gets an appreciative laugh from the students
now the startingaof this industry was very humble indeed
the kit computer on the cover of that magazine we hear a little muffled giggling coming from the row behind mark and eduardo mark is too into the speech to
notice but the giggling registers as a slight annoyance on eduardos face
had an processor in it and you had to assemble it yourself and it came with k of memory
eduardo hears the giggling again and turns around
in the row behind them and a few seats over are two beautiful asian students
alice and jenny
theyre a little overly made up for a lecture
jenny the one sitting closest to eduardo is wearing a short skirt with a white shirt open one button too far down the front and we can see a hint
of the red bra shes wearing underneath
she leans forward and whispers to eduardo your friend isnt that mark zuckerberg
you know mark
didnt he make thefacebook
eduardo smiles a little
this has just never happened yeah
both of us
its mine and his
its our were yes
this is alice
eduardo cant help noticing just because its in his line of sight that down the row from the girls someone else is pointing at them and whispering to a friend
then back to the girls very nice to meet you
facebook me when you get home
maybe we can all go out for a drink later
ill certainly absolutely i will do that
eduardo turns back to the speaker who mark hasnt taken his eyes off of there were a set of machines that came after that
the trs apple ii
as the crowd from the lecture spills out onto the snowy quad
eduardo always in his suit
is buttoning up his overcoat as he walks and mark zips up his hoodie
she said facebook me and we can all have a drink later
which is stunningly great for two reasons
one she said facebook me
and the other is that you know they want to have drinks later
yes have you ever heard so many different good things packed into one ordinary sized sentence
a group of guys hustle up to mark and eduardo excuse me
im stuart singer
im in your o
awesome job with thefacebook
how you doin
you know i could swear he was looking at you when he said the next bill gates could be right in this room
i doubt it
i showed up late i dont even know who he was
it was bill gates
oh shit that makes sense
as mark and eduardo walk on we leave stuart vikram and bob in the background with stuart and vikram admonishing bob with are you a moron
are you medically stupid
you cant recognize bill gates when hes standing in front of you for an hour
mark zuckerberg now thinks we got into harvard on a dimwit scholarship
im gonna get a glock and im going to kill you
im actually going to kill you etc
as the door opens and mark and eduardo come into the overheated warmth of the room
its time to monetize the thing
those asian girls were cute
what were their names
did you hear what i said
i said its time to monetize the site
what does that mean
i mean its time for the website to generate revenue
no i know what the word means
im asking how do you want to do it
what were their names
weve got members
cause thefacebook is cool
if we start installing pop ups for mountain dew its well i wasnt thinking it would be mountain dew but at some point and im speaking as the business end
of the we dont even know what it is yet
we dont know what it is what it can be what it will be
we know itas cool thats a priceless asset and were not giving it up
eduardo is sitting at marks desk and hes seen something sitting on top of a pile ofbooks
mark what is this
what eduardo holds up a letter thats on a lawyers stationary
this i think its called a cease and desist letter
what were their names
eduardos speed reading the letter
when did you get this
about days ago
right after we launched the site
i liked th shorter one
theyre saying the winklevoss twins are saying you stole their idea
i find that to be mildly annoying
they find it to be property theft
why why didnt you show this to me
it was addressed to me
theyre saying we stole thefacebook from divya narendra and the winka i know what it says
please dont screw around with me now
look at me
what are you my mother
the letter says we could face legal action
no it says i could face legal action
its from a lawyer mark
they must feel they have some grounds for the lawyer is their fathers house counsel i checked it out theyre not do they have grounds
yes the grounds are thefacebook is cool
and popular and sexy and harvardconnection is lame
i didnt use any of their code i didnt use anything
a guy who builds a really nice chair doesn
t owe money to everyone who ever built a chair
th ey came to me with an idea i had a better one
why didnt you show me the letter
i didnt think
it was a big deal
if theres something wrong if theres ever anything wrong you can tell me
im the guy who can help
is there anything you need to tell me
no what are we doing about this
i went to a l at student legal services and he told me to write them back
what did you say
when we met in january i expressed my doubts about the site where it stood with graphics how much programming was left that i had not anticipated the lack of
hardware we had to deal with the lack of promotion that was needed to successfully launch the website etc
this was the first time you raised any of those concerns right
id raised concerns before
not to us
back to mark im talking about at the meeting in january to which this letter is referring
let me re phrase this
you sent my clients e mails
in the first you didnt raise any concerns
is that a question
in the nd e mail you raised concerns about the sites functionality
were you leading them on for six weeks
why hadnt you raised any of these its snowing
it just started snowing
zuckerberg do i have your full attention
do you think i deserve it
do you think i deserve your full attention
i had to swear an oath before we began the deposition phase and i dont want to get arrested for perjury so i have a legal obligation to say no
no you dont think i deserve your attention
i think if your clients want to stand on my shoulders and call themselves tall they have a right to give it a try
but theres no requirement that i enjoy being here listening to people lie
you have part of my attention the minimum amount needed
the rest of my attention is back at the offices of facebook where my employees and i are doing things that no one in this room including and especially your
clients are intellectually or creatively capable of doing
did i adequately answer your condescending question
gage just looks casually at mark
mark doesnt meet his gaze or the looks from divya tyler and cameron
why dont we
say thats lunch
everyone gets np and we int
marks dorm room a night eduardo puts the letter back on
the desk and looks at mark
their names were jenny and alice they want to have drinks tonight
its a nice mens room mahopny stalls in a nice club in cambridge
we hear the thumping of the house music coming from the club
and then one of the wooden stall doors flies open and eduardo is shoved in followed by jenny who did the shoving
shes all over him as she presses him back against the divider
eduardos hands are sliding under jennys white shirt and finding the red bra when they hear a noise
someones gone into the next stall
i dont care
jenny keeps him pinned against the divider as she reaches down and unbuckles his belt
and then he hears another noise from the stall next door
a thump against the divider
jennys got his fly unzipped
eduardo looks down at the space between the stalls
he sees a pair of adidas flip flops
then the sound of moaning before eduardo has time to say anything jenny pulls her shirt open revealing the red bra and puts her hand down his pants as we
mark and eduardo are standing guard outside the door
theyre silent but very happy
a guy comes along to use the mens room
itll just be a minute
some girls are freshening up in there
nodding a little sweet
the guy goes off
we have groupies
mark cant help a smile
then he sees something
ill be right back
where you going
mark makes his way through the crowd toward a round booth
a girl is sitting there and even though her back is to mark he can recognize her
shes with a girlfriend and three guys
when he makes it to the booth he says erica
erica from the opening scene turns her head and looks up to see mark
shes looking sexy for her friday ni
ght on the town and the three guys shes with are studs
a few more friends of theirs are standing around at the edges of the booth
i saw you from over there
i didnt know you came to this club a lot
its my first time
its not bad
the musics kind of lame
could i talk to you alone for a second
i think im good right here
mark is aware of everyone else around the booth
i dont know if you heard about this new website i launched
you called me a bitch on the internet mark
im really sorry about that
on the internet
thats why i came over
comparing women to farm animals
i didnt end up doing that
it didnt stop you from writing it
as if every thought that tumbles through your head is so clever it would be a crime for it not to be published
the internets not written in pencil mark its written in ink and you published that erica albright was a bitch
right before you made some ignorant crack about my familys name published my bra size and then rated women based on their hotness
why dont you say it to me now why dont say it to my face
i dont want to
erica is there a problem
no theres no problem
youre not a real person mark
you write your bullshit from a dark room because youre a failure at human contact
i liked you and i was nice to you
i came over to say i was sorry for all that and to see if there was any chance i dont want to be rude to my fxiends i should
be talking to them
a year from now you wont remember this conversation and you wont remember me
i think youre wrong
listen good luck with your video game
it was an honest mistake on ericas part but a kidney punch to okay
mark turns and goes and sees that eduardo has been standing at and watching from a distance with jenny
that was cool you did good
you talked to her that was the right thing to do
it was good mark
we have to expand
over the music what
we have to expand
and mark heads out the door
eduardo watches mark and then looks back at the girls and answers the un asked question i dont know
is he mad about something
the door closes behind dustin moskowitz and chris hughes
mark and eduardo are waiting and jenny and alice are sitting on the bed
everyones got a beer
once the door is closed
were expanding thefacebook to yale and columbia
dustin i want you to share
the coding work with me
chris youre going to be in charge
of publicity and outreach
you can start by getting a story about the expansion in the b
they hate doing stories about harvard
somebody at the newspaper will be a computer science major and they will have heard of me
tell em mark zuckerberg will do hours of free programming for theno
why do you want a story in the b
because i do
heres the business arrangement
eduardos cfo and owns of the company dustins vice president and head of programming and his of the company will come from my end
chris is director of publicity and his compensation will depend on the amount of work he ends up doing
who are the girls
jenny and alice is there anything we can do
yale and columbia lets go
its time for them to see this in palo alto
mark is sitting alone in the now empty room
theres a computer on a table in the corner and mark makes a few keystrokes and then reads the screen
marylin the young lawyer we met early on comes in with a plastic salad container in her hand and sits at the far end of the table from mark who
doesnt acknowledge her
after a moment you dont want any lunch
youre welcome to some of my salad
no thank you
i know this must be hard
who are you
im marylin delpy i introduced myself this morning
i mean what do you do
im a second year associate at the firm
my boss wanted me to sit in on the deposition phase
what are you doing
checking in to see how its going in bosnia
they dont have roads but they have facebook
you really hate the winklevoss twins dont you
i dont hate anybody
the winklevi arent suing me for intellectual property theft
theyre suing me because for the first time in their lives the world didnt work the way it was supposed to for them
tyler and cameron are both studying when divya busts in
hes expanding to yale columbia and stanford itll be in the crimson tomorrow
a so that cease and desist letter really scared the shit out of him huh
i want to hire a lawyer to file for injunctive relief and get this website taken down now
every minute its up harvard connection becomes less valuable i want an injunction i watt damages punitive relief and i want him dead
i want those things too
then why arent we doing anything about it
because were gentlemen of harvard
because youre not thinking about how its going to look
hows it going to look
like my brother and i are dressed in skeleton costumes chasing the karate kid around a high school gym
he violated massachusetts state law
then when he goes to connecticut new york and california hell have violated federal law
and by the way hes violated harvard law
theres no such thing as harvard law
yes there is
cam there is
tyler goes to the bookshelf and pulls down a manual
harvard student handbook
every freshman is issued this book
somewhere in here it you cant steal from another student
this is what we needed
you think campus security is going to arrest him for copyright violation
were going to meet with the president
you cant get a meeting with larry summers
my brother and i pay tuition at this school we carry a
gpa at this school weve won trophies for this school and well be rowing in the olympics for this school
i want a damn meeting with the president of this school
why do you think
a pretty year old co ed amy pulls a curtain open and the darkened room immediately fills with un welcomed sunlight
you dont know my name do you
amys wearing nothing but a stanford sweatshirt and talking to a skinny year old guy whos lying on her futon
theres other evidence on the walls that were at stanford university

amy heads into the bathroom but leaves the door a little ajar
sean steps over to amys pink laptop and hits a key to wake it out of sleep mode
the shower starts running in the bathroom
the laptop springs to life and is open to something seans never seen before a facebook page

after you went unconscious last night i went on thefacebook for a while
started at harvard and standfords had it for about two weeks and its awesome except its addictive
seriously im on the thing five times a day all my friends are
you mind if i grab a piece of paper and a pen
what are you talking about
i need to find
says aza sean scrolls down to the bottom of the page where it mark zuckerberg production mark zuckerberg
cameron and tyler in dark suits are waiting to see the president of harvard the presidents office is in one of the two oldest university buildings in the country and
the secretary sitting at the desk i ven older
you get the sense that she thinks harvard would be d better place if it werent for all these students
she looks at them and the boys give her a polite smile and a small nod before she goes back to her work
just making small talk ive never been in this building
without really looking up this building is a hundred years older than the country
so do be careful
were just siting in the chairs
she hangs up the phone
you can go in now
she points to a door and cameron and tyler get up quickly straighten themselves and walk into larry summers a large man is on the phone at his desk in
his well appointed office
a fire crackles in the sitting area and a ish african american woman anne in a pants suit is nearby going over some papers
summers waves the boys in thats just their own stupidity i should have been there
darkness is the absence of light and stupidity in that instance was the absence of me
summers motions for them to sit and they do
they take in some of the photographs around the room summers with bill ctinton etc
catherine i have students in my office now
i dont know from the looks of it i think they want to sell me sets of identical brooks brothers suits
well speak later
summers hangs up the phone good morning
good morning s ir
im cameron winklevoss and this is my brother tyler
cameron is extending his hand but instead of taking it summers reaches to the top of a pile of papers and pulls a ten page letter off the top
why are you here
theres silence while summers appears to read over the letter
that wasnt rhetorical
im sorry i thought you were reading the letter
ive read the letter
well i think its pretty self explanatory
we had an idea for a website called harvardconnection weve since changed the name to connectu and mark zuckerberg stole that idea and what do you want me to do
cameron points to a row of harvard student handbooks on the bookshelf behind summers
well sir in the harvard student handbook which is distributed to each freshman under the heading standards of conduct in the harvard community and the sub heading honesty oh dear
it says the college expects that all students will be honest and forthcoming in their dealings with members of this community
all students are required to respect private and public ownership
instances of theft misappropriation or unauthorized use of or damage to property excuse me anne
punch me in the face
beat then to cameron go ahead
will result in disciplinary action including the requirement to withdraw from the college
thats what is says in the handbook
when did you memorize that
a little frustrated with this
sir its against university rules to steal
from another student plain and simple
youve spoken to your r a
yes sir and the r
made a recommendation to the ad board but the ad board wont hear us
have you tried dealing with mr
zuckerberg hasnt responded to any of our e mails or phone calls for
the last two weeks
he doesnt answer when we knock on his door at kirkland and the closest weve come to talking face to face is when i saw him on
the quad and chased him through harvard square
you chased him
i saw him and i know he saw me and i started after him and he disappeared you know he could have you arrested for harassment and attempted assault
this isnt happening
i dont see this as a university issue
of course its a university issue
theres a code of ethics and an honor code and he violated them both
you entered into a code of ethics with the university not with each other
im sorry president summers what you just said makes no sense to me at all
im devastated by that
what my brother means is that if mark zuckerberg walked into our dorm room and stole our computer it would be a university issue right
i really dont know
this office doesnt handle petty larceny and the only reason i agreed to see you anne by did i agree to see them
colleagues of their father
so you see
this isnt a petty larceny
this idea is potentially worth millions of dollars
millions of dollars
you might be letting your imagination run away with you
with all due respect i dont think youre in any position to make that call
i was u
treasury secretary im in some position to make that call
letting our imaginations run away with us is exactly what we were told to do in your freshmen address
i would try letting your imaginations run away with you on a new project
everyone at harvard is inventing something or starting a new business in their dorm room harvard undergraduates believe that inventing a job is better than getting one so can i
suggest again that the two of you come up with a new new project
im sorry but that s not the point sir
whats the point
you dont have to be an intellectual property expert to understand the difference between right and wrong
and youre saying that i dont
of course im not saying that
im saying that
summers looks at tyler and then smiles
just start another project
like were making a diorama for the science fair
and if you have a goddam problem with that mr
winklevoss the courts are always at your disposal
athletes dont get special treatment at this school
do they get fairness
they dont get to run to daddy
this isnt years ago
excuse me sir but in your analogy is daddy our father or you
is there anything else i can do for you
well i wouldnt mind that much if you took a flying ty
thank you for your time sir
we appreciate your seeing us
get the door on your way out would you
as cameron and tyler exit tyler closes the door a little too hard and the brass doorknob comes off in his hand
he drops it on the secretarys desk as he exits i broke your year old doorknob
eduardo spring break you and mr
zuckerberg took a trip to new york
what was the purpose of the trip
as cfo id set up some meetings with potential advertisers
who paid for the trip
it was paid for out of the thousand dollar account id set up a few months earlier
at this point your thousand dollars was the only money that had been put into the company
how did you feel the meetingswent
they went terribly
mark was asleep
i wasnt asleep
can i re phrase my answer
i wish hed been asleep
eduardo in a three piece suit is pitching the executive
mark in his hoodie and flip flops is completely detached and staring at the floor
and were at schools now with over members
people who go on thefacebook tend to stay on longer than almost any other site and heres the most impressive statistic of people who try it once come back
now if youll excuse me
are we boring him
there was one more meeting scheduled for the new york trip
it was set up through my girlfriend at the time
would you say that mark was excited about this meeting
yes very is a hip and trendy restaurant in tribeca
the young crowd is drinking cocktails of all different colors and wearing prada we find eduardo
in a three piece suit and mark in his hoodie and flip flops along with eduardos now girlfriend jenny sitting at a table
with an empty seat waiting
theyre not gonna card us here
l be embarrassing tell him theyre not gonna card us
theyre not gonna card us
are you gonna talk about ads again
unless youre the ballet theatre of hartford the urpose of a business is to make a profit
this isnt a business
thats tough for me because im the business head of the company
mark says nothing
hes minutes late
hes a god he can be as late as he wants
hes not a god what is he
i think wardos jealous
i honestly wasnt jealous
i was nervous
i didnt know him at all but id done an internet search and asked around
he struck me as kind of a wild man
he crashed out of two pretty big internet companies in spectacular fashion and hes got a reputation with drugs
he also foundedthe companies
we dont need him
nodding toward the door hes here
sean parker has stepped into the restaurant and is
saying hello to the hostess while hugging a waitress
and he does own a watch
sean stops at a table to shake hands with a guy in a suit and kiss his girlfriend
its sort of an incongruous sight this year old kid whos able to work a room like sinatra
who the hell is this
take your time
sean makes his wayover to marks table im sean parker
how do you do
you must be eduardo and jenny
and mark its great to meet you
great to meet you
you guys dont have anything in front of you
we were waiting for to a
passing waitress cori
hey baby boy
could you bring out some things
the lacquered pork with that ginger confit
i dont know tuna tartar some lobster claws the foie gras and the shrimp dumplings thatll get us started
jenny what do you like to drink
from that point on it was a sean a thon
id never seen anyone perform a monologue at dinner before but thats what happened
the ca era is moving around the table as sean in and out of mos a is telling story after story while food is brought drinks put down more food
brought and more drinks put down
mark is enthralled jenny is sexy and eduardo is polite
he took us through his episode with napster
tried to sell the company to pay the million they said we owed in royalties and in the end we just had to declare bankruptcy but i made a name
and then he went to his second business venture which was plaxo an online rolodex
see we had a vc from the beginning
michael moritz a partner at sequoia capital whod invested in yahoo and google
moritz wanted to push me out from ginning and he hired private detectives to dig up everything on me they could
did they find anything
but i was out of the company
im not done with moritz and sequoia capital yet
i swear to god mark before im im gonna make those guys kiss my ass and then cry like girls there will be retribution for plaxo and im not just
i brought down the record companies with napster and ill bring down michael moritz you didnt bring down the record companies they won
shrugging it off well
and he told story after story about life in silicon valley parties at stanford and down in la friends who d become billionaires and then he finally got around to
tell me about your progress
were in schools now and we
ignoring eduardo and going for tell me about the strategy youre using
for instance we wanted baylor in texas but baylor already had a social network on campus so instead of going right after them we made a list of every school
within a hundred miles and put thefacebook on those campuses first
pretty soon all the baylor kids were seeing their friends on our site and we were in
thank you it was mine
settle an argument for us would you
i say its time to start making money from thefacebook but mark doesnt want advertising
neither of you
thefacebook is cool thats what its got going for it
you dont want to ruin it with ads because ads arent cool
its like youre throwing the coolest party on campus and someones telling you its gotta be over at
you dont even know what the thing is yat
i said exactly that
row big it can get and how far it can go
picture sharing news feeds a virtual champagne room apps you havent even thought of
is no time to take your chips down
a million dollars isnt cool
you know whats cool
a billion dollars
and thats where youre headed
a billion dollar valuation
unless you take bad advice in which case you might as well have come up with a chain of very successful dry cleaners
when you go fishing you can catch a lot of fish or you can catch a big fish
you ever walk into a guys den and see a picture of him standing next to fourteen trout
no hes holding an
pound marlin and thats what you want
hey guys its your company i dont have a dog in this fight
irjust came to say hi
no he came to hook an pound marlin and he did
he owned mark after that dinner
he picked up the check told mark theyd talk again soon and was gone
but not before he made his biggest contribution to the company
signing the check oh hey
drop the the
just facebook its cleaner
and sean heads out patting backs and kissing waitresses along the way
thats gotta be some kind of land speed record for talking
you want to end the party at eleven
im trying to pay for the party
there wont be a party unless its cool
whatd you think
sure lets drop the the
i meant catching the marlin instead of the
doesnt that sound good
only if youre a trout
im going to enter this as plaintiffs exhibit
incorporation papers for facebook a limited liability corporation registered in florida to eduardo for the record why florida
thats where my family lives
and ask the respondent to stipulate that the documents of incorporation state the ownership as follows percent for mark zuckerberg percent for eduardo saverin and percent for dustin mosokowitz
and that was april th
you can mark it
do you have anything here
yes thanks mr
saverin have you ever done anything that would be considered legitimate grounds for termination
no you never did anything to embarrass the company or even seriously jeopardize it
you were accused of animal cruelty is this a doke
i have an article here from the crimson i cant have this wardo marks talking about the crimson article in his hand
eduardo is standing next to a crate thats holding wait for it a live chicken dustin is sitting at the desktop computer staring at something intently
its bullshit its one of the other clubs playing a prank
they identify you as id gotten into the phoenix
id been accepted and as part of my initiation i had to for one week carry with me at all limes and take care of a chicken
one of the founders of facebook
junior eduardo saverin co founder of facebook wa
s im not the expert but being connected to torturing animals is probably bad for business
i wasnt torturing the chicken i dont torture chickens are you crazy
settle down please
im holding an this is scathing
without looking up nine hundred and fifty six
trying to be calm listen to me
i was having dinner in the kirkland dining hail with mark and i had the chicken with me because i had to have the chicken with me at all times
this was college
im gonna have to answer for this
nine hundred sixty nine
the dining hall was serving chicken for dinner and i had to feed my chicken so i just
i cut up little pieces of chicken and gave it to the chicken
there were a lot of people there and someone must have seen me and the next thing i knew i was being accused of forced cannibalism
at the end of the table marylintries but fails to stifle a small laugh
eduardo looks down the table
i didntknow you cant do that
i dealt with the various animal rights groups i dealt with the associate dean of the college it was all fine
nine hundred and eighty eight
someone from the fly or the porc must have reported it
for all i know it was the winklevoss twins who may have been tipped off by somebody else who was there
alright lets just forget about it
i cant forget about it im being accused of animal cruelty
its better to be accused of armed robbery
im going to have to explain this to my father im going to have to explain this to everyone im going to have to what is happening on that
eduardos referring to a laptop thats open and displaying images of four paintings
have my final coming up for postwar and contemporary art and i havent been to class
im supposed to write about those four paintings
is that a facebook page
yeah i opened it under an alias
i posted the paintings and asked people to comment
every once in a while i hop on and stir the pot to get a good debate going its beautiful
uckerberg was cheating on his final exam
id rather not answer that gretchen
because im not suing him for cheating on his final exam and so thats not what friends do
well you just told us he was cheating
you told your lawyers i was torturing animals
no he didnt tell us about it at all
our litigators are capable of doing a google search
in fact when we raised the subject with him he defended yu
nine ninety three we are so close
were gonna need more money wardo
more servers more apps and i want to hit that coal by the end of the summer
im interviewing people tomorrow two interns to come to palo alto for the summer and were gonna have to pay them something
i already found a house for rent on a street two blocks
from the stanford campus
its a piece of junk but its perfect and its got a pool
when did you decide to go to california for the summer
you mean when did i actually decide
somewhere in the middle of the sean parker variety hour
he was right
californias the place weve gotta be
youre jed clampett
you guys got the beverly hillbillies in a yes we got the show in brazil it was genius
whats your problem with sean
he doesnt bring anything to the table
he doesnt have money dustins a better hes got connections to the vcs
we dont need vcs we need advertisers and ive got connections to the vcs
the real players and as someone whos just really embarrassed the company in a bad way it was the winklevosses mark
dustin hits refresh on the desk top computer
he was obsessed with the guy from sequoia capital
he was followed by private detectives
who came up with nothing
enough to get him out of plaxo
the drugs the girls we dont know any of thats true
you can read about it and you can read about you torturing birds
dont fish eat other fish
the marlins and the trout
what the hell
im interviewing interns at tomorrow night in t y cs lab
get on board with this or not
eduardo steps through double doors and stops for a moment as he hears an odd sound raucous cheering from acrowd thats gathered in one of the classrooms
eduardo walks down to the classroom opens the door and walks where or so students are in a semi circle five and six deep cheering on the contestants for the
all the desks in the room have been moved to the sides and five desks with laptops set up in the middle
next to each laptop is a shot glass filled with jack daniels
dustins holding a
watch and mark is walking slowly back and forth behind the five interviewees who are intensely typing at their keyboards
eduardo slowly makes his way through the crowd to mark
he can see that on the computer screens are a whole lot of numbers and letters that neither he nor we can understand
he stands next to mark and watches this for a moment
every once in a while one of the contestants will throw back their shot of jack daniels which will instantly get re filled by a pretty asian girl
throughout all this the cheering continues
whats goin on
they have minutes to get root access to a python webserver expose its ssl encryi ti on and then intercept all traffic over its secure port
all behind a pix firewall emulator
but heres the beauty
you know i didnt understand what you just said right
i do know that
whats the beauty
every th line of code written they have to drink a shot
and hackings supposed to be stealth so anytime the server detects an intrusion the candidate responsible has to drink a shot
i also have a program running that has a pop up window appear simultaneously on all five computers the last candidate to hit the window has to drink a shot
plus every three minutes they all have to drink a shot
all five candidates drain their shot glasses and slam them down where they get re filled by the pretty asian girl
can i ask what part of the interns jobs will they need to be able to do drunk
a more relevant test would be seeing if they can keep a chicken alive for a week
what i just said was mean and im sorry
are we alright
we started this as a team
eduardo hands mark a thick envelope here
i opened a new account and put it
will that get you through the summer
mark looks at eduardo
suddenly two of the candidates hands shoot up almost at the here
mark glances over at the first screen then the second
welcome to facebook
the place erupts
the pretty asian girl hits an mp player thats been hooked up to speakers and a dr
dre song blares out california its time to party
the two winners are hugging each other and getting wild congratulations from the crowd
mark looks back at eduardo and smiles
eduardo gives him a pat on the back and we
in addition to the youd already put up
a total of now
marks scratching something out on a pad
im just checking your math on that
yes i got the same thing
i can continue
mark motions ves
after expressing misgivings about mr
zuckerberg taking the company and moving it to california for the summer why did you turn around and put in an account for his use
i figured we were a team and i wanted to be a team player
i figured mark dustin and the new interns could work on the site while i worked on generating advertiser interest in new york
and mostly i figured
how much could go wrong in three months
mark is standing on the roof of this small campus area house as loud music plays
a zii line is tied from the chimney and runs down over a small swimming pool where its attached to a telephone pole on the other side
mark grabs onto the handle thats connected to the zip line and flies out over the pool jumping in with a splash and cheers from dustin and the interns who
are waiting their turns on the roof
dustin pulls the handle back up with a rope thats been rigged grabs the handle takes off and jumps into the pool to similar cheers
the handle gets pulled back on a rope an intern grabs it and the brick chimney comes crashing down
the intern drops into patio furniture as bricks from the chimney come cascading down
are you alright
etc im okay
is anything broken
and at that moment a stray brick drops from the roof and crashes through a glass patio table
thats gonna out into the security deposit
from inside the doorbell rings thats the doorbell
i didnt know we had a doorbell
get the door
hes wired in
mark walks into the place is computer geek paradise
computers are everywhere along with some of the empty boxes they came in
pizza boxes chinese food containers empty beer bottles and white boards filled with indecipherable code fill the room
there are a couple of large mattresses on the floor and a large map of the u
with pins and tags showing the schools where theyve already put facebook and different pins showing the schools theyre going for
as mark walks to the door he walks past andrew whos sitting at a computer writing code and completely oblivious to everything around him
snapping his fingers andrew
mark gets to the door and opens it
hes stunned to see sean parker standing there with his girlfriend sharon
they all look at each other for a moment mark
do you live here
we were right across the street we saw the chimney come yeah
is anybody hurt
you live across the street
this is my girlfriend sharon
she lives across the street and i was helping her move out when we saw the chimney yeah we had a zip line to the pool
you came to california
you made the right choice
sea s looking around the place
dustin and the interns are standing off to the side happy to be in the presenbe of sean parker
andrews still locked into his computer
marks off in the kitchen
here you go
a beer comes flying out of the kitchen and sean catches it
another beer comes flying out which sharon had no idea was coming and so it smashes into the fireplace
im so sorry
and a brick comes down the chimney and crashes on top of the broken glass from the beer bottle
you know ironically were paying an extra bucks a month cause it has a working fireplace
this house is great
the team is great
its exactly what it should be
im sean parker
mark comes out of the kitchen hes wired in
thats what im talkin about
hes got an internship in new york
eduardo didnt come out
an ultra hip san prancisco nightclub where a line of well dressed young people stretches from the clipboard holding bouncer down the block
the bouncer motions to three sexy girls who are let in through the velvet rope
if this reminds us of the scene at the final club party at the beginning of this story than thats fine
the three sexy girls take us into its a hundred year old theater thats been converted into a st century hot spot for silicon valleys rock stars
the lower level is a giant dance floor packed with sweating somethings bouncing to pounding house music
there are raised blocks where scantily dressed professional
dancers perform non stop
a huge lighting grid hangs from the ceiling shooting colored lights and lasers everywhere
also hanging from the ceiling are two trapeze bars with two performers swinging and contorting
a waitress holding a tray of colored drinks high over her head takes us through the crowd to a spiral staircase thats being guarded by two more bouncers with clipboards
the staircase leads up to the nd level which is all vip tables that look out over the dance floor
each vip area has a couple of couches and a table covered in bottles of vodka tequila rum mixers ice glasses and a private waitress whos happy to bend over
and pour a drink for you and thats where we catch up with mark and sean
sitting next to sean is a beautiful woman and theres another standing behind him and leaning against the couch
mark and sean have to speak the music
i still cant believe i rented a house across the street from you
thats not my house
it was sharons
i was crashing there for a little
bit while im taking care of some things
but shes done for the summer so shes back at her parents place and im homeless
you can crash at our
place for a few days if you want
id man thanks im going to the ladies room you got it
ill go with you
the two girls exit your date looks so familiar to me she looks familiar to a lot of people
what do you mean
look at any victorias secret catalogue from the last six months
ill tell you something you know how i founded napster
i know everything there is to know about you sean
fuck wikipedia mark no you dont
i was going out with this girl in high school
and it was great
i thought it was great but the whole time almost the whole time we were together
like five months she was giving blow
jobs to the co captain of the lacrosse team
and i found out and i was willing to forgive her but she told me she loved him
so i had this dream that i would make a billion dollar company
not a million dollar company any hack can do that a billion dollar company
and i would have business cards printed up that said im ceo
its our time
we run the universe
yeah shes a victorias secret model
i want to know where the fuck eduardo is
he has an internship
in new york
the companys here
a billion dollar company is here
and what confuses me is that in new york eduardo introduced himself as the business head of facebook
ive been at the front of two of the biggest things in the history of the internet and i can tell you that nothing nothing is more important to a
start up than the energy and ambition of its founders
you have to live and breathe the project every minute of every day and night
do you live and breathe facebook
i know you do
i know those guys back at the house do
the guys eyes did not blink when a beer bottle smashed into a fireplace feet from his work station
so ill ask again wheres eduar itd be great if you stayed at the house with us
i think i should
the girls come back you guys figure out a new way to get porn on your computer
you know most of its bad but some of its pretty good
mark and sean arent paying attention
whats your goal for the summer
we want to
be in a hundred schools
ill tell you what
gesture of good faith
while youre getting yourself into a hundred schools im gonna put you on two continents
lets line up some shots
to the waitress you can take away the cuervo well have don julio
the waitress goes off mark
i never told her my name
were looking at a stone bridge crossing a perfectly straight stretch of water against the backdrop of the medieval town of henley england founded in
and after a moment of placid quiet two razor thin skulls explode out from under the bridge for the final agonizing hundred meter stretch of the ancient and prestigious henley
the two boats are neck and neck coming out of the bridge
the port side boat is being crewed by the two dutch members of the ilollandia roeiclub
the starboard boat is being crewed by a pair of identical twins wearing tank tops bearing the h of harvard
we hear the roar come up from the crowd in the viewing section
the crowd is dressed as if for opening day at ascot the women in flowing dresses and wide brimmed hats the men i n blazers and brightly colored floral ties
but the young men in the boats can barely hear the crowd
just their own breathing as they pull against the longest natural
straight stretch of water in the world a mile and a half torture test against the best competition theyve ever faced
and theyre neck and neck
cameron and tyler cant shake the dutch
the crowd is going crazy in their own english way as none of them can remember ever seeing two boats this close this late
mixed in with the british crowd is a small contingent waving the flag of holland and a slightly larger contingent of americans
well notice a stoic man in a vip viewing section and latex well be introduced to him as cameron and tylers father next to him is their mother who can
back on the boats its just the breathing as the skulls slice through the water like jet powered knives
meters now and theres still no daylight between them
we see a small trickle of blood from camerons left hand begin to stream down his arm
meters and the dutch and american fans are going crazy even the british aristocracy cant help but get caught ups the closest race in the history of the competition
the ath pti is silently willing his boys one more fraction of boat speed the mother has her hands over her mouth in praying position
the blood thats covering camerons left arm is being diluted by the sweat thats pouring down from his triceps as they dig and pull and pull and pull and the
finish gun is fired into the air the oars come out of the water and the bodies of the crewmen slump over
cameron turns his head to the cheering crowd to see the dutch group holding a giant flag and
jumping up and down
the americans bring their giant flag down and fold it up
the two dutch crew
members pump their fists in the air and hug as the two boats skim along to a gentle stop
the mother drops her head and looks down
the father refuses to look away
from cameron and tyler just thebreathing
cameron and tyler are standing with their coaches and next to the two dutch crewmen who are with their coaches
theyre on a stand in the stewards enclosure a sprawling and glamorous tented area for the exclusive use of members and their guests
after a moment a man in a double breasted navy blazer steps out with his retinue in tow
the man is prince albert of monaco
he receives a healthy clapping of golf applause as he approaches the stand
this conversation is done without microphones or anything as modern as that
his royal highness prince albert
sir may i present mr
cameron winklevoss and mr
winklevoss of harvard university
never seen a race that close
less than one second the steward tells me
yes your highness
my grandfather jack kelly was one of the premiere rowers of his day
ive been coming to henley for years
never seen a race that close
have you seen a race that close
cameron is thinking about starting a war with monaco right now so he lets his brother do the talking
no your highness
mile and a half races are more commonly won by a boat length or two
yes thats absolutely right
less than a second though in your case
well as they say i suppose it just came down to who wanted it more
oh what a bullshit cliche you think we cam
theres an awkward silence for a moment
will i have the pleasure of watching you both row again in beijing
if we make the team sir yes
i present you with your second place ribbons
on to the champions
and off the applause from the crowd we the regatta party is underway
music drinks uniformed waiters blazers and hats everywhere
tyler and cameron have changed into their harvard
blazers and are joined now by divya
the three of them have tried to find an unpopulated spot
tyler and divya have glasses of beer and are standing but camerons sitting at a table with a laptop open and watching film of the end of the race
hitting reverse on the computer and watching over and over again the bow of the dutch boat pull ahead by six inches at just the right moment
we didnt want it enough
that was the problem
fuck you you fucking little casa
the guy s the prince of a country the size of east hampton
let it go
winklevoss has made his way over
how are you mr
that was a tough beat
a tough beat
im sorry dad
you and mom flew all the way over
listen to me good you two
dont you ever apologize to me for losing a race like that
dont you ever apologize to anyone for losing a race like that
another man comes along mr
dad this is mr
kenwright part of our host family this week
pleasure to meet you
good to meet you
i just had the most extraordinary phone chat with my daughter
she told me that she and her friends are all talking about the race which ended just a half hour ago via their computers
a new website called facebook
do you have this in america
ryon is frozen
your daughter doesnt go to school in the no no
majoring in french literature though i wasnt aware there was such a thing
they have facebook at cambridge
and oxford st
andrews warwick and the london school of economics best as i can tell
because thats where her friends are
im going to find your mother
good race boys
live to fight another day
the men leave and cameron tyler and divya are alone
cameron looks at them for a moment then turns back to watching the
turn it off
turn it off cam
look at me
cameron turns to his brother
i dont mind that we got beat by the dutch by less than a second
that was a fair race that was a good race and they had the better boat today and theyll see us again
what i mind is that we got beat by mark zuckerberg
by less than a second
we tried the ad board we tried the president of the university and we tried talking to him ourselves
now im asking you
for the one hundreth time
lets take the considerable resources at our disposal and sue him in a federal
cameron looks at his brother
then turns back to the computer
he watches the dutch boat pull ahead at the last moment
tyler and divya are just about to give up when cameron swings back and says lets fucking gut that little nerd
jamming his fists in the air finally
theres a thunderstorm going on outside and rain is beating hard against the windows dustin andrew and the interns are hard at work writing code
green day is pumping from the speakers
sean is pacing the house on his cell phone while two young women dressed to go out for a party are at the moment each on a free computer playing
each other in a game of counter strike
basically theyre shooting at each other and missing and laughing their heads off it wouldnt appear as if the house has been cleaned since the last time we saw it

eduardo looks at mark for a long moment before we eduardo comes through the doors with single minded intent heads past the tellers and straight to a desk where he
takes a bankbook out of his pocket and slaps it on the desk
can i help you
i want to freeze this bank account and cancel all existing checks and lines of credit
stories of polished granite
were in the offices of a guy whos hero is gordon gekko
mark and sean are waiting seated side by side for a verdict
seans wearing his best prada marks wearing his hoodie and adidas flip flops
after a moment
you know this is where they filmed towering inferno
the office door opens and peter thiel sticks his head out come back in
they get up and walk into
several of thiels lieutenants are sitting around
weve talked it over and congratulations
were gonna start you off with a investment
maurice is gonna want to talk to you about some corporate restructuring
well file as a corporations eiaware and come up with a new stock strn ructure to allow for new investors now lemme ask you something
whos eduardo saverin
a summer sub let
a studio apartment the size of a small too
eduardo is asleep on top of the covers in the un air conditioned apartment when he wakes up to the sound of a key in the door one lock un
locks then another hello
and then the last
the door opens and jenny is framed by the dingy light of the hallway
when did you get back
you scared me
i need you to knock first
when did you get back
i got back this afternoon
and when were you going to call me
jen it was kind of a rough trip and i was tired and or answer one of my texts
did you know i sent texts
i did and i thought that was incredibly normal behavior
are you mocking me
i brought you a present
why does your status say single on your facebook page
why does your relationship status say single on your kacebook page
i was single when i set up the page
and you just never bothered to change it
i dont know how
do i look stupid to you
youre asking me to believe that the cfo of facebook doesnt know how to change his relationship status on facebook
its a little embarrassing so you should take it as a sign of trust that i would tell you that
puck you wardo
you didnt change it so you could fuck silicon valley skanks every time you go out to see mark
that is not even remotely true and i can promise you that the silicon valley skanks dont care what anyones relationship status is on facebook
please let me give you your present
eduardos cell phone rings oh your phone does work
eduardo reaches for his cell but jenny grabs it first to check the id
jenny tosses the still ringing phone back to him okay this is gonna be tricky
here open your present
its a silk scarf
have you ever seen me wear a scarf
thisll be your first
eduardos gotten the gift box out of his half un packed suitcase tossed it to jenny and finally answered the phone
into his cell phone you froze our account
in the background theres a small celebration going on with sean dustin the interns and of course some girls
champagne is being sprayed from shaken bottles and the girls
are dancing to triumphant music
you froze the account
i had to get your attention mark
do you realize that you jeopardized the entire company
do you realize that your actions could have easily destroyed everything ive been working on
weve been working on
without money the company cant function
what eduardo cant see behind his back is that jenny has taken the gift box and lit it on fire with a cigarette lighter
if the servers are down for even a day our reputation is damaged irreversibly
users are fickle
friendster has proven that fact
and jennys now dropped the flaming cardboard box into the wastebasket where the fire grows larger
she casually kicks the basket over with her foot
even a small exodus even a few people leaving would reverberate through the whole user base
the users are interconnected thats the whole fucking point
college kids are online because their friends are online and if one finally seeing the fire holy shit
goes all the dominos go
do you get that
im not going back to caribbean night at the jewish fraternity
ive got a fire in a my apartment
did you like being nothing
did you like being nobody
did you like being a pasty faced geek
you wanna go back to that
im putting you on speaker
eduardo hits a button on his cell and tosses it down
keep hearing marksavoice as eduardo runs out into the hallway grabs a fire extinguisher from its wall bracket comes back in and sprays out the fire
that was the actof a child not a businessman
and it certainly wasnt the act of a friend you know how embarrassed i was when i tried to cash a check
and i was with a girl wardo
it happened in front of a girl
im not going back to that life yeah
okay maybe you were angry maybe you were frustrated
im ready to let uh to let bygones be bygones because ive got some good news
eduardo with the fire now out picks up the phone
maybe was angry and it was childish
i needed to get your attention
i said ive got some good news
what is it
peter thiels just made an angel investment of a half a million dollars
a half a million dollars and hes setting us up in an office
they want to re incorporate the company they want to meet you and they need your signature on some documents so get your ass on the next flight back to
i need my cfo im on my way
eduardo clicks the phone shut
youre going back there
also im breaking up with you
a glass conference room in the corner of a glass bullpen on a high floor of a high rise
cartons are being unpacked computers are everywhere along with bags of potato chips and boxes of cereal
in the conference room eduardo is sitting with three lawyers at a round glass table and documents have been put out in front of him
we can see through the glass that mary is working at a computer nearby
sean is also hovering in the background
four documents these two are common stock purchase agreements allowing you to buy stock in the newly re incorporated facebook instead of the old stock which is now worthless the
third is the exchange agreement thats for exchanging your old shares for new shares and this is the voter holding agreement
how many shares of stock will i own
why the rise from the original
because you may need to dilute it to award shares to new investors
i like dealing with business majors
you should know that marks already taken his percentage from down to
mark doesnt care about money and he needs to be protected
dustin moskowitz owns
h i can live with that
and peter theil
would you like to use my pen
its dusk now and the sky outside the room is turning purple
eduardo seems lost in thought
eduardo looks up
could you please repeat the question
counsel and when you signed these documents were you aware that you were signing your own death certificate
it was insanely stupid of me not to have my own lawyer look over all the the uh
i thought they were my lawyers
i was a harvard business major
then to mark i was your only friend
you had one friend
my father wont look at me
zuckerberg saying anything to you after you signed the papers
well there was a lot of handshaking and congratulations
hed already told me he wouldnt be coming back to school for at least a semester so we were saying goodbye for a while
and then before i left he said int
race k office a day but you gotta come back
somewhere around the end of november early december
peters gonna throw us an amazing party when we hit a million members its gonna be out of control
youve gotta come back for it
quietly cant believe it a million members
remember the algorithm on the window at kirkland
yeah ill be here
a brand new black escalade pulls up in front of a gleaming glass and chrome office building
sean is at the wheel and mark in the passenger seat is wearing brightly colored pajamas with his hair a mess
they get out of the car and huddle on the sidewalk
you sure about this
youre minutes late
youre going to walk in there and say you overslept
and you didnt have time to get dressed theyre gonna pitch you sequoia capital is gonna pitch you
theyre gonna tell you why you should take their money
theyre gonna beg you to take their money youre gonna nod youre gonna nod youre
gonna nod and then youre gonna say which one of you is michael moritz
moritz is gonna say thats me
and youre gonna say sean parker says fuck you
and walk right on out
mark heads into the office building
sean looks up to the windows of a high floor points and says fuck
in late november i got the e mail from mark telling me to come out for the millionth member party
what else did the e mail say
it said that we had to have a business meeting
that mark and sean had played some kind of revenge stunt on michael moritz and sequoia capital
and that it had impressed moritz so much that he was making an investment offer that was hard to turn down
i went out to california and went straight to the new offices
and its clear that were in the offices of a new high tech very successful internet company
the facebook logo in blue metallic letters on the wall the maple desks new computer monitors carpeting a wall covered in graffiti by an artist commissioned for
the job and tons of young employees
i didnt know whether to dress for the party or the business meeting so i kind of dressed for both
we see that most of the employees especially the women are dressed to go to an after work late night party
but it didnt matter
because i wasnt called out there for either one
what were you called out there for
eduardo turns to see the lawyer he dealt with earlier standing by the door to a glass conference room
eduardo walks across the bullpen where no one makes eye contact and into at first i thought he was joking giving me more contracts to sign
but then i started reading
as eduardo reads we rack focus to mark whos sitting at a computerwith his back to eduardo focused on his work
and then we see sean step into the frame and lean against a desk a few yards away
and then back to eduardo whos almost shaking
what is this
what is this
if youll let me eduardo goes back out into mark
mark doesnt look up from his computer mark
mark still doesnt look up hes wired in
hes wired in
eduardo picks up marks laptop over his head and smashes it down on the desk breaking it into pieces
how bout now are you still wired in
to the girl at the desk hes call security
everyone in the office is frozen silent and watching
you issued over million new shares of stock
you were told that if new investors came how much were your shares diluted
how much were his
what was mr
zuckerbergs ownership share diluted down to
it wa i what was mr
moskowitzs ownership share diluted down to
what was sean parkers ownership share diluted down to
what was peter thiefs ownership share diluted down
what was your ownership share diluted down to
point zero three percent
you signed the papers
you set me up
youre gonna blame me because you were the business head of the company and you made a bad business deal with your own company
its gonna be like im not part of facebook
gonna be like youre not part of facebook youre not part of facebook
my names on the masthead
eduardo is momentarily frozen
this is because i froze the account
you think we were gonna let you parade around in your ridiculous suits pretending you were running this company
sorry but my pradas at the cleaners along with my hoodie and my fuck you flip flops you pretentious douchebag
oooh security is here
youll be leaving now
two security guards have come in im not signing those papers
well get your signature
turning to mark tell me this isnt about me getting into the phoenix
maybe if youd spent a little less time with your new friends and a little more time with the company
you did it
i always knew you did it
you planted the story about the chicken
what the fuck is he talking about
you had me accused of animal cruelty
seriously what the fuck is up with the chicken
and ill bet you just hated that they identified me as a co founder of facebook which i am
you better lawyer up asshole cause im not comin for my percent im comin after everythin g get him outa here
sean hands eduardo aafolded check
wouldnt cash it though i drew it on the account you froze
then suddenly and quickly cocks his fist back to punch him in the face
sean flinches as eduardo holds his punch and lets out a small laugh
i like standing next to you sean
it makes me look tough in comparison
eduardo exits with the security escort
theres a long silence in the room
thats our show for tonight
i want to see everybody here get geared up for a party
were gonna walk down to the club like its the macys thanksgiving parade
mackey put it up on the screen weve gotta be almost there
a young employee hits a remote and a few keys on his computer and a huge flat screen displays a facebook page with a read out of the number of
theres scattered applause and excitement as everyone watches
sean takes mark aside
you were kinda rough on him
thats life in the nfl
you didnt have to be that rough on him
listen im putting together a party
you didnt have to be that rough on him
i get it
ill send flowers
im putting together a party after the party at gamma phi beta
ashleigh over theres a sister and she says her friends are all down
ive been you know ive been talking to her a little
i dont know i think she likes me
an intern ashleigh comes along with a small package excuse me mark
we were just talkin about you ash
were on for tonight
this came in for you
you can put it on my desk
ashleigh puts the small package on marks desk
shes i cant he
lp it but ill tell you what after tonight
in fact im
gonna get you in with all sorts of girls you wouldnt have met before
blandly to sean youd do that for me
mackey hits the refresh key and the big screen shows cheers erupts throughout the place
sean grabs mark and hugs him but mark doesnt quite hug back hes still hearing what sean just said
we can hear the thumping music coming from the party inside and college kids have spilled out onto the front lawn of this pristine four columned house
its dark but we can make out people dancing
the place is packed
we hear the thumping music from the party
seans in there with a couple of guys ashleigh and another girl
seans got his cell phone out and will snap a picture every once in a while
i cant find a mirror
do it on anything
you can use a cd
do it off this
ashleighs sat on the bed and unbuttoned her top so that shes in just a bra
shes offering her chest as a surface off of which to snort cocaine
the girl taps out some coke from a vial onto ashleighs chest and starts passing around a rolled up dollar bill for everyone to have a turn and she herself
will unbutton her shirt too for the same purpose
all this while sean is talking the next transformative development
a picture sharing application
a place where you view pictures that coincide with your social life
it is the true
digitalization of real life
you dont just go to a party anymore you go to a party with your digital camera and your friends relive the party on facebook
the idea that you could tag anyone you wanted in those pictures so that people could find themselves
then a digital log of every change in a persons life broadcast to all their friends instantaneously
would this be easier without the bra
its worth finding out
the girls start happily slipping off their bras ive spent hours why has the music stopped
ive spent hours watching what people do when they log on
seriously why has the music stopped
ashleigh has a point
the music stopped in the addle of seans speech and the sound outside from the party just doesnt sound like a party anymore
flow they always checked their friends status updates checked to see which of their friends had changed their profiles changed their photos and mostly
we lived on farms then we lived in cities and now were gonna live on the internet
somethings going on downstairs sean stops talking he senses it too now
sean walks out of the room to the and out the window he sees a fleet of police cars with their lights flashing parked in front of the house
then before he can react the front door flies open police with flashlights walk in the beams of light streaking across the darkened party floor and the faces
we hear muffled murmurs from the cops of partys over and step to the side and nobodys leaving just yet etc
sean bolts back into
leaving the door open
its the cops
and they all spring into action
the girls are putting their bras back on sean is wiping down a night table with the palm of his hand to get the coke dust off
whats goin on
they turn to see two policemen standing in the doorway their flashlights scanning the room and hitting seans eyes
were sorry was the music too loud
weve got kind of a celebration going
ladies i need you to put your shirts on
i can have them turn the music down
one of the policemen casually takes seans hand and sees that his palm looks like he just used it to erase a blackboard
the cop uses his finger to taste what it is
yeah that isnt mine
okay could you all stay where you are
and the handcuffs start to come out and weve got a room of terrified children
wait can we just talk for a second
we start to move in on seam
you got anything in your pockets i need to know about
dont be stupid now i don it
out of seans shirt pocket whats this
its an epipen and this
thats my inhaler
ladies how old are you
im lying makes a i e worse
im i m sorry i shouldnt have lied
his eyes at hearing this news as we hear the sound of the cuffs lock around his wrists and we a digital led clock on the wall tells us its
mark is sitting at his computer alone
no one else is in the office
the san francisco skyline is beautiful outside the floor to ceiling glass
his cell phone rings and he answers
sean freezing with no coat on is sitting on the bottom of the steps to the police station
the lawyer weve seen before is standing in back of him
listen somethings happened
we see mark listening on his end but cant hear seans end of the conversation
its alright its gonna be alright

mark clicks the phone shut
he sits there a moment
he looks at the small package
that ashleigh dropped on his desk earlier
he opens up the brown paper wrapping and theres a box
he opens the box a thousand brand new business cards
he takes one of the business cards out and looks at it
bitoh and over this we hear a womans voice
mark is sitting alone
in the conference room
the only one left is maryl

mark looks up at her
everyones gone mark doesnt say anything

mark sits down at the computer
he logs on to facebook

ericas name and picture come up along with boston university
shes on facebook
he moves the mouse back and forth between two boxes send a message
