href b b midnight cowboy by waldo salt a susskind type moderator is speaking into camera tonight well discuss a subject most of us seem to consider either bad taste
or frivolous or funny
but if our experts are right we face what might be called a masculinity crisis
every fourth american man uptight threatened by the increasing sexual demands of american women
an irate woman speaks into camera they always put it that way but well all it means you know is every fourth american womans never satisfied
i never am have been you know
a cool woman speaks into camera this this image of the the man eating woman
it isnt our increasing demands
i think its the shrinking american male
a sad woman speaks into camera no i never had well whatever it is you call it
but the hours he works i cant blame him
full frame a scandal sheet picture of a sex starved wife naked while her husband sleeps captioned i buy what my but its a problem
a big problem
with so many women i know
camera pulls back to show the picture among other pinups of women rich beautiful or naked but all blonde steam wilted on the wall over a dishwashing machine
joe buck grins at the wall as he scrapes garbage
just keep your pants on ladies
a lady commentator gradually surrounded by lonely women
before world war one american men outnumbered women by over six percent
today american women not only outnumber men but live five years longer leaving them in control of vast corporate wealth and seventy five percent of americas purchasing power
the lady commentator is replaced by joe stacking dishes surrounded by frustrated ladies
he laughs tolerantly
yall line up and take your turn
the moderator smiles into camera
my question is this will american know how come up with a marketable male to replace all the men who are worrying themselves into an early grave over womens increasing
joe sings as he soaps himself whoopee ti yi yo git along little dogies for you know new york will be your new home
sound and image freeze on joes open mouth
titles follow as indicated sound and action continuing after each credit
joes song continues over a sweating waitress glancing up
wheres that joe buck
wrapped in a towel singing in front of his dresser mirror joe sprays himself with deodorant aiming a last playful blast at the unseen crotch freezing song and image as
credits continue over
a calendar girl on the wall blushing orange mouth frozen in a tiny o staring wide eyed
joes song continues as
joe rips the wrapping from a new stetson and sets it on his head freezing song and image as credits continue
ralph an aging black man faces a mountain of dirty dishes
wheres that joe buck
singing as he buttons his new cowboy shirt joe interrupts himself to answer ralph
yeah wheres that joe buck
continuing his song as he pulls up and zips his tight thighed black slacks freezing song and image for credits
sally buck a pretty middle aged blonde smiles down at camera you look real nice joe baby
joe sings as he pulls on his new cowboy boots arranging his cuffs to show off the yellow sunburst at the ankle freezing song and image for credits
the pink manager scowls at his pocket watch
wheres that joe buck
joe hums as he piles a complete wardrobe of cowboy clothes still in their wrappers into a shiny new suitcase of black and white horsehide
yeah wheres that joe buck
holding his watch the manager wags a finger at camera
youre due here at four oclock
look at those dishes look
joe laughs as he locks his suitcase
know what you can do with those dishes
and if you aint man enough to do it yourself id be happy to oblige
joe picks up his suitcase a portable transistor radio walks away from the mirror then pauses to run a comb through his hair hook a cigarette at the corner of
his mouth and strike a match on his thumbnail before he turns back for one admiring glance at himself in the mirror proud exultant ready freezing the image as credits end
joe leaves the hotel carrying his suitcase
the pink manager points at his watch angrily
four to midnight understand
angle widens to include joe holding his suitcase and radio
ralph stares at him curiously stacking dishes
say look uh i gotta have a word with you if you got a second
the manager hurries away carrying a basket of dishes
you aint coming to work
just come for my days pay owing and to tell you im heading east
joe tilts his stetson as the waitress appears at the door
but she disappears without noticing joe
ralph offers his hand
joe takes it holds it
what you gonna do back there east
lotta rich women back there
men they mostly faggots
must be some mess back there
well aint no use hanging around here
aint gonna collect your pay
i got me two hundred twenty four bucks of flat folding money
slaps hip he know what he can do with that chicken shit days pay
and if he aint man enough to do it for himself i be happy to oblige
the door marked employees only swings open and joe appears measuring his effect on the customers and his fellow employees as he crosses the sterile white dining room observing the
drab details of the life he has left behind garbage on greasy dishes limp food in steam table trays coffee soaked cigarette butts caked mustard and ketchup on formica table tops two pimply high school girls slurping suggestive noises after joe through the straws of empty coke glasses
a tiomkin tradition chorus sings from this valley they say you are going we will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile for they say you are taking the sunshine
the song ends as joe comes from the cafeteria
that brightened our pathway a while
tough tiddy ladies you had your chance
from a high angle joe starts his long walk toward the bus depot along the street of a small western town struggling to urbanize itself
the click clack click of his boots is loud but somehow lonely the radio at his ear drones grain prices on the commodity change
joes pace slows as he passes
a gilt lettered sign in the window glittering in the sun momentarily hiding the fact that the shop is deserted
joe grins as he hears remembered sounds and voices incomplete flashes more significant in tone than content a girl giggling sexily keep your meat hooks off my beauty operators sugar
tinkling noises of a busy beauty parlor sally buck singing hush little baby dont say a word grammaw gonna buy you a mockingbird
a shift of light revealing a row of tarnished driers a broken mirror a for rent sign in the window
joe turns toward the bus depot radio pressed to his ear
benson and hedges one hundreds makes special awards from time to time for anything thats longer than anything
care to get out your yardstick gentlemen
at the same moment a recognizable variant of the big country theme blares loud
gary cooper or john wayne walks a frontier street
high angle of the departing bus intercut big country fashion alternating high shots with close ups of the bus wheals
through the bus windshield a dizzying montage of traffic lines arrows and signs as the bus sweeps around and up onto the freeway
joe sits at the front opposite the driver cracking his gum as he watches the huge billboards streaking by promising him power happiness and beautiful women if he chooses the
right breakfast food hair oil or automobile
joe listens to the humming tires the roar of the engine shaking his head
this is a powerful mothah aint it
ignored by the driver joe rises and walks back to his empty double seat glancing around to see what impression hes made on his immediate fellow travelers an old lady
in front of him a hostile young sailor with acne behind him two teeny boppers flirting with joe hysterically a pale blonde directly across the aisle smiling at joe weakly
do you have a stick of gum
joe leans across snapping his gum as he offers her a stick
he watches her nibble it daintily on her front teeth
plenty more where that came from
thank you no its just till the dramamine works
i get carsick
i only get carsick on boats
waits then but seems to me thats more the fish smell than the bouncing
joe realizes that her eyes are closed
mildly depressed he stretches himself across both seats and turns on his radio finds only static and snaps it off
further depressed he examines his reflection in the bus window squeezes a black head and runs the comb through his hair picks a piece of tobacco off his tooth and
lights a cigarette watching the flame die in reflection forgetting to discard the burnt out match as he stares out at a vast lonely prairie a solitary cowboy in the distance a row of sharecropper shacks apparently deserted a barefoot little girl motionless at the roadside watching the bus pass
through this leading into the next scene sally buck sings softly
if that mocking bird dont sing grammaw gonna buy you a golden ring
sally buck relaxing in the middle of a busy day eyes closed wearily while little joe massages her neck
her song continues over the noises of the busy beauty parlor
if that golden ring turns brass grammaw gonna buy you a looking glass
no a little lower sugar yeah yeah thats good
you gotta sell yourself thats the whole trick
a seedy traveling salesman with badly fitted dentures and a frayed collar has taken the aisle seat next to joe
as he lectures joe on salesmanship he figures his expenses in a worn leatherette notebook nervous fingers and eyes unconsciously revealing the extent of his failure
it aint the product and it aint the price no sir and it aint what you sell its personality pure and simple
i aint shined my own shoes or shaved my own face in forty years hows that
not bad for a kid that didnt pass the eighth grade right
yeah hell yeah
and thats my golden rule
make em love you
put yourself over and you can sell them anything
if they like you theyll buy horsemeat for prime beef
a gawky adolescent joe sits sprawled on the couch leafing through a magazine while sally buck bleaches the roots of a young womans hair
you get him to the church honey
he aint gonna find out you aint a real blonde till after youre married thens too late
sally buck turns pretending to be stern as toe laughs
you getting too big for your britches sugar
the headlights of the bus flash past a huge sign painted on the slant roof of a barn jesus saves
joe is alone again
the salesman has disappeared
the bus is dark most passengers trying to sleep
only one reading light still burns over the head of the old lady in the seat ahead of joe
joe squirms restless trying to lull himself to sleep with the music of a revivalist gospel group on the radio
dont forget to say your prayers honey
joe leans forward to help the old lady irritably struggling with the release button on her seat
she scowls as joe leans over to release her seat then pulls her blanket around her and turns away from him
joe switches off her reading light
i want it on
joe switches it on again fakes a good natured grin settles back with his radio aware of an old cowhand seated opposite him replacing the pale blonde
the old cowhand is appraising joes wardrobe curiously
he looks away when he sees joe watching him
joe settles back unable to think of a way to open a conversation
oh my friends i say unto you invest with jesus put your dollars to work where theyll pay off at compound interest
the good book says money answereth all things
the old cowhand has rolled himself a cigarette
joe quickly lights a match on his thumb and holds it across the aisle
the old cowhands thanks is lost in a fit of coughing as he inhales his first drag
he settles back wiping his watery eyes on a faded bandana
everyone who sends a dollar to the evangelical congregation of the air will get free gratis a genuine leatherette hymn book so you can sing along with sister rosella and
the evangelical choir
you throw in sister rosella and you got a deal right old timer
joe glances across the aisle
the old cowhand manages a faint humorless smile
up the line
im bound for new york city
the old cowhand reappraises joes wardrobe even more curiously
ever happen to come across a cowman name of woodsy niles
friend of my grammaw sally buck
the old cowhand considers shakes his head
joe leans back laughing to himself
little joes head is lost in a beat up cowboy hat similar to the one worn by the old cowhand
sally buck smiles on woodsy niles a long legged cowboy with a shock of black hair who stands at her dressing table admiring himself in a new stetson
like it honey
does it fit
you do me good sal you do me real good
you know what i gonna give you for that stetson
woodsy grabs sally buck lifting her off her feet carrying her to the bed
struggling they fall across the covers together little joe laughing with them
he dont know what makes little apples by now its time he found out
joe shakes his head grinning offering the old cowhand a cigarette
the old cowhand shakes his head showing the rolled cigarette joe lit for him
joe nods still bemused
little joe is cuddled in sally bucks arms under the covers watching woodsy sitting cross legged on the bed naked except for his stetson and guitar singing drunkenly
git along little dogies
from a high angle the bus slows to a stop
joe awakens stiff necked momentarily confused
he straightens in his seat as he sees the old cowhand lifting a sweat stained saddle down from the overhead rack starting toward the front of the bus
joe calls after him
nice talking to you old timer
joe stuffs a stick of gum in his mouth turns to wave at the old cowhand through the window as the bus pulls away
she dogs squat boy
he dogs stand up and lift their leg
woodsy in his new stetson watches little joe in his beat up cowboy hat trying to balance on one foot one leg lifted in front of the trough
woodsy roars with laughter
but he men stand and shoot from the hip
joe laughs flushes checks his hair in the mirror
the bus streaks past a brightly colored billboard in new joe is now sitting in the wide rear seat between two young marines and a group of veterans wearing campaign
caps and convention buttons passing a bottle singing from the balls of montezuma to the shores of tripoli
joe follows the conversation between a veteran and a marine participating only because hes sitting beside them adopting a remembered military stance
ever stationed at kennedy
those florida chicks
instant v goddam d
this pensacola teeny bopper jail bait but built
ten bucks she wanted
three of us made a deal for twenty five see big goddam bargain

oh hell no
motor pool mostly

a plump aging prostitute laughs up into camera
hey hey what you try to do to me
you gonna cost me money soldier
joe laughs as he passes the bottle trying to sing along without knowing the words as the veterans segue into over hill over dale we will hit the dusty trail
as the caissons go rolling along
sally buck fondly wipes lipstick from joes lips
keep your meat hooks off my operators sugar hear
joe slaps one of the veterans on the back trying to follow the song into off we go into the wild blue yonder
anastasia clutches a younger joe eyes wild gasping
youre the only one joe the only only one ever
joe is leaning across the two marines staring out of the window as the veterans switch to anchors aweigh my boys anchors aweigh
a stunning view through the bus window past joes reflection
gonna swing my lasso and rope that whole goddam island yeah
drum majorettes leading the parade ticker tape and confetti girls at skyscraper windows
charles lindberg or james stewart waving at the crowd
girls lining the piers flags banners bunting ship horns whistles bells
joe crowded as the veterans prepare to leave the bus lifting down banners and flags
the bus suddenly surrounded by converging traffic horns honking segueing into the noises of times square
flag draped reading welcome veterans
flapping in the wind welcome veterans
the marquee announces transients welcome
a singing radio station break blares w i n s new york
the sign flashes wins
ten ten on your dial
a torchy womans voice sings from a lonely echo chamber introducing a love theme which will haunt joe throughout the film
joe sets his radio on the dresser his suitcase on the bed then turns to examine his new home as anonymous as his texas hotel room but boasting a coin
operated television set
fascinated joe inserts a quarter
the love song continues over a television talk show featuring a poodle wigmaker defending his profession against a joe pyne type panel host
well i perform a real service theres a need so many people you know really live in their pets i mean lonely i grant you but their feeling is real
they want to lavish as much love give them as much yes pamper them like they were really human children or whatever
theres a tv dinner in the fridge lover boy
little joe stares sullenly at an antique tv box while sally buck puts her hat on at the fireplace mirror
there is a framed picture of woodsy niles on the mantle
you be okay wont you
maybe i bring you a treat if youre a good boy
joe watches the panel host
youre a nut case fella a real nut case
little joe massaging sally bucks neck continuing the earlier scene
im so beat no point you waiting round toots think ill stop in for a beer or two
joe sits on the edge of the bed watching the poodles primp
little joe stares unblinking at the tv screen as sally buck kisses him on the forehead dressed for the street
expect me when you see me
looks like i got me a new beau lover boy hows that for an old grammaw
ill leave you movie money
sally buck tucks a dollar bill under a framed picture of jesus who has replaced woodsy niles on the mantle
as a fairy godmothers magic wand removes sticky hair spray from a pretty models head joes quarter runs out and the screen goes blank
at the same moment the love song is cut off by a singing station break w i n s new york joe rises flipping the dial of the radio to
a cultured womans voice reading
the dow jones averages brought you by morgan vandercook
up your income with sound investment counseling
up yours lady
but joe leaves the lady on savoring the expensive sound of her voice reading the stock quotations
joe seats himself at the desk pleased to find a postcard photograph of the hotel
he picks up a ballpoint pen counts ten floors up from the street and marks a huge x this is me then turns the card over pen poised over the
ralph stares at the card surrounded by dirty dishes
hell he know i cant read
joes pen wavers starts to write and stops
as we saw it last deserted a for rent sign in the window
joes reflection appears staring at himself dressed in his dishwashers clothes
after all them dishes are washed what
then they bring some more dishes and i wash them and then i uh sleep some and then wash some more dishes and then i
say it lover boy
joe stares at the postcard bemused well you better just shake your tail lover boy and root hog or die
joe rises abruptly rips up the postcard and tosses it out the window
goddam if i came to this town to write postcards
the torn fragments flutter down on the crowd a woman brushing irritably at her hair a man grimacing glancing up a cop removing his hat to examine it
from a low angle identical with the postcard photograph an unseen hand scrawls a huge x this is me
camera zooms up to a close up of joe at the window
from on high as though joe were watching himself the stetson moves through a crowd of fifth avenue shoppers
passing a glass bank lady tellers counting money
passing a display of imported luxury cars
passing a window which features a single gem pausing as horns blast o
and a mod blonde in a stalled sports car motions to joe she needs a push
joe grins glances at himself in the window runs a comb through his hair then turns back to see a cop helping the mod blonde
joes heels drag as he walks a deserted block of luxury apartment houses
the torchy womans voice sings joes love theme in counterpoint to the blasting horns a siren a fire bell a screech of brakes
joes spirits rise as he hears the tic tac tic of high heels overtaking the heavy click clack click of his boots
he adjusts his pace to arrive at the corner at the same time as a smart and in joes eyes very rich lady
joe grins boyishly holding his stetson over his heart
beg pardon maam im new here in town just in from houston texas and looking for the statue of liberty
the delicate profile gives no signs of hearing
joe follows her to the parkway in the middle of the avenue
there she stops and turns neither friendly nor hostile
were you looking
about the statue of liberty
i mean business
i thought you were never mind ive never actually been there but let me see you take the seventh avenue subway i think to the end of the line
you sure are a pretty lady
the rich lady tries to frown taken aback blushing
youre not looking for the statue of liberty at all
no maam im not
why thats perfectly dreadful
arent you ashamed of yourself
a twinkle of amusement and sympathy reveals the age lines at the corner of her eyes
then she continues on quickly just as the light turns
joes view is blocked for a moment by traffic then he sees
the rich lady newly aware of her flanks as she climbs the steps of a brownstone and searches for her key
still from joes viewpoint he sees himself move into frame and follow the rich lady up the steps
the love theme swells o
as the rich lady leads him into the house and closes the door
leaving joe standing alone on the parkway island surrounded by towering wealth
the love theme continues over
a pair of high heeled pink slippers walking a miniature poodle slowing slightly reacting to joes cowboy boots as they pass pause and turn back
hurry up baby
do um goody goods for mama
joe grins holding his hat over his heart as he approaches cass trehune a blonde lady in a tight black dress with the look of a movie star who wrecked
her career with food
beg pardon maam
im brand spanking new to this town come from houston texas and hoping to get a look at the statue of liberty
youre hoping to get a look at what
the statue of liberty
its up in central park taking a leak
if you hurry youll make the supper show
now get lost
but as she turns cass winks dimpling the corners of her mouth signaling joe to follow her
cass holds the door open button till joe enters the elevator then the doors close with a soft expensive little kllooosh and cass turns with the smile of a very
her lips closing on joes as the poodle yaps shrilly at their feet
superimposed almost subliminally a golden dollar sign appears halating like a star and the bell of a pinball machine rings o
a princess telephone is ringing on a gold and white desk
cass runs to grab it
as joe steps from the elevator which opens directly onto casss penthouse
cass beckons him toward her hooks a finger into his neckerchief and pulls his mouth toward hers while she talks on the phone
hi ee honey
cass gurgles happily as her free hand unbuckles joes garrison belt
im just out of breath honey running to catch the phone
as her fingers reach for joes zipper cut to
joes hand unzipping her dress
i was walking baby
him got to do him goody goods right
the poodle tugs at joes slacks until they fall
cass steers her ear to joes mouth shuddering deliciously
oh god oh stop
i cant stand that
i just die
quickly into phone its baby morey
him trying to say hello
say hello to morey baby
cass holds the phone toward the yapping poodle twisting herself against joe as she wriggles out of her dress passing the phone from one hand to the other
okay old goosie
now lookie when do you want me to meet you
whatever you say
ill take a nap watch tv you know kill time
okay but just one a big wet one
cass hangs up
the poodle yaps hysterically disentangling himself from her tumbling dress hops onto the couch glances off and flees again as an overturned lamp crashes the poodle bounces onto the bed
remaining long enough to establish a tv remote control tuner lying on the satin coverlet then leaps down in panic as he hears joe and cass explode into the bedroom laughing lustily
the remote control tuner buried suddenly under the full flesh of casss hip activating
a twenty five inch television screen blasting at full volume
casss eyes widening profoundly impressed
the images and sound of the television set flicking joyfully from channel to channel
joe laughing engulfed by casss abundance
cass wild eyed overflowing the frame
a gleaming slot machine three sahara cowgirls clicking into line for jackpot silver dollars overflowing the frame
the mutual of new york tower flashes mony
holy shee it this is a goddam penthouse you got here cass a real goddam penthouse
joe turns away from a small terrace buckling his belt glancing off toward the sound of cass in the shower
he flicks the tv remote control enjoying his power ignoring the silent images on the screen battle casualties a pretty girl recommending aspirin a mans stomach flashing animated pain starving
war refugees a dog eating pzazz flicking it off to concentrate on the costume jewelry and perfume bottles on casss dressing table
dont look baby
joe turns to look as cass comes from the bathroom holding a towel around her as she runs behind the closet door
say cass i uh sure have enjoyed being here
believe its as fine a time as ive had in my life
me too lover
thats good it is cause well i guess i didnt tell you why i came to new york did i
a tower of black bugle beads emerges from the closet door
zip this thing will you tex
joe zips her dress follows her to the dressing table where she sprays her hair with lacquer
truth is cass im well im in business

cass stretches her upper lip across her teeth and she smears it with orange lipstick

joe grins relieved as she takes out a gold lame purse and opens it
he frowns as she folds it upside down empty
i didnt get to the bank tex could you let me have a little coin for the taxi waxi
joe stands mute as she cups his chin in her hand seductively
youre such a doll
i hate money dont you
god its been fun
funny thing you mentioning money
i was just about to ask your for some
joe tries to laugh but it sticks in his throat as cass speaks an impassioned whisper still holding joes chin
you son of a bitch
you think youre dealing with some old slut
look at me
you think just cause youre a longhorn bull you can get away with this crap
well youre out of your mind
i am a gorgeous chick thirty one thats right you said it
sobbing suddenly she throws herself on the bed
joe stands bewildered by the vastness of her grief
did you think i meant that
christ would i be asking you for money with a wad like that riding on my hip
joe waves his wallet at her but she only cries louder
he hands her a kleenex
she clutches it to her face wailing
joe leans over the bed whispering in her ear hey
you are a gorgeous looking piece cass
guy gets horny just looking at you
its a fact
how much you need for that taxi
there you go
joe tucks a twenty dollar bill into her bosom tilts his stetson and starts out
cass blows her nose looking after him
chorus sings from this valley they say you are going we will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile
from a high angle joe walks away from the apartment house chorus continuing o
they say you are taking the sunshine that brightened our pathway a while
joe sits at the bar staring morosely at his image in the mirror already quite drunk oblivious to the assorted types hiding from daylight in the barn like saloon waiting
for night to fall
excuse me im just admiring that colossal shirt
ratso studies joe across the corner of the bar a sickly child size old man of twenty one hopefully nursing an empty beer glass contemplating the money on the bar
in front of joe
that is one hell of a shirt
i bet you paid a pretty price for it am i right
oh it aint cheap
i mean yeah id say this was an all right shirt
dont like to uh you know have a lot of cheap stuff on my back
ratso spits as jackie leans on the bar next to joe a feminine young person heavily made up hair teased wearing earrings and a lace trimmed blouse over shocking pink
got a cigarette cowboy
a stage whisper more goddam faggots in this town
reaching for a cigarette joe glances at jackie startled as jackie twitches his pink levis angrily and turns away
shakes his head kee rist you really know the ropes
wish to hell i bumped into you before
im joe buck from texas and im gonna buy you a drink what do you say to that
enrico rizzo from the bronx
dont mind if i do
slaps bar same all around
for my friend too
the tv screen over the bar features a mating game program as jackie cruises down to join a tall farm boy with plucked eyebrows
the tv host points to three young men visible only from the shoulders up from whom a pretty date girl in blindfold must choose an escort
and for the losers who dont get the girl well give as consolation prices a six month supply of underarm deodorant
in a booth now the tv screen in the background continuing the game joe is refilling ratsos beer glass as he speaks loud over the laughter of the tv audience
you see what im getting at here
she got a penthouse up there with color tv and more goddam diamonds than an archbishop and she busts out bawling when i ask for money
for money for what
im a hustler hell didnt you know that
how would i know

picking up trade on the street like that baby believe me you need management

my friend odaniel
thats who you need
operates the biggest stable in town
in the whole goddam metropolitan area
a stud like you paying
not that i blame you a dame starts crying i cut my heart for her
id call that a very minor operation
ratso grabs the neck of a bottle sliding back in the booth
joe scowls as jackie appears with the tall farm boy
in fact you just sit comfy and ill cut it out with my fingernail file
you wont even need blue cross ratso
the name is rizzo
thats what i said ratso
suddenly hey now you heard him
on the tv screen the date girl announces i pick number two

im used to these types that like to pick on cripples
sewersre full of em
may i ask one thing cowboy
if you sit there and he sits way over there hows he gonna get his hand into your pocket
but im sure he has that all figured out
to ratso good night sweets
may present your chosen mate
the tv host pulls aside the screen which has concealed the lower half of the three young men
number two her chosen mate is a dwarf sitting on a high stool
the girls spontaneous dismay starts everyone laughing hysterically including the dwarf
joe has difficulty keening up with ratso who swings himself along with surprising agility his half skipping little gate favoring one game leg
look with these chicks that want to buy it most of em are older dignified right
social register types
they cant be trotting down to times square to pick out the merchandise
they need a middleman right
joe hesitates as ratso darts into traffic against a red light yelling unheard obscenities at a cab driver who blasts his horn
joe runs recklessly forward as ratso slams the taxi fender with his fist pretending to be hit falling into joes arms
the taxi stops halting traffic
ratso recovers strolls casually in front of the cab biting his thumb at the driver
it is a crime a stud like you passing out double sawbucks to a chick like that
with proper management you should be taking home fifty a hundred bucks a day
more if you wanta moonlight
at the corner of central park south ratso points toward a young man with diamond cuff links sitting with a blue haired matron who puffs on a small cigar
ratso waves jauntily at the young man raising his thumb and forefinger in a circle leaving the young man baffled as ratso hurries joe on
him i placed with odaniel just two weeks ago
not much of a stud either what i hear
ratso automatically checks the coin return boxes of the phone booths they pass
walking the park side of the street looking across at the limousines and taxis waiting outside luxury hotels and apartment buildings
hey listen how about you take me to mee this mister odiddle bird right now
well joe youre a nice guy and id be doing you both a favor but why
whatm i dragging my bum leg all over town for

ratso stops opposite the plaza hotel pointing across at an aristocratic blonde stepping out of a rolls royce
tomorrow when some piece like thats scratching your back in a fifth avenue townhouse wherell your pal rizzo be
hold it just hold it

ratso is on the phone
joe holds the door open listening
this boy is just your meat mr
odaniel believe it im telling you what
enrico rizzo from the bronx
the point is he needs you
aside to joe i got his tongue hanging out
camera moves slowly up the anonymous wall of a drab hotel following the line of dim red lights marking the fire exits
names joe buck
just in from texas dont know the ropes new to the city but very promising material sir and ready if you get what i mean
whats that room number there again
as ancient open cage lift rises at the same pace as camera in preceding shot
joe grins excitedly at ratso who nods but glances significantly at the elevator operator
ratso follows joe to door as the operator grinds to a stop
ratso steps out with joe gesturing to the corridor
hold it a second
but the operator slams the door and starts on up
ratso leans heavily on the down button glancing at joe
nine oh one got it
ratso glances up the elevator shaft nervously rings again and turns back to joe
lets see how you look

ratso leans on the down as the cage grinds slowly down into view and stops
sherry netherlands hotel
now get your ass in there
ratso steps into the elevator as the door opens then closes leaving joe alone repeating cherry neverlin as he starts along the corridor looking for
ratso bursts from the hotel almost running as he disappears
joe finds at a dark end of the corridor knocks confidently hearing a few bars of his love theme as he stuffs a fresh stick of gum in his mouth
then the door is thrown open by odaniel for an instant appearing to wear a diamond studded skull cap the naked overhead light bulb bright after the dark corridor halating
in joes eyes like the earlier dollar sign
you must be joe buck
odaniel fat in a worn out bathrobe examines joe like a prodigal son as he leads him into the room as anonymous as joes own room

odaniel rises suddenly in a fury of self righteousness pacing his voice simpering whining sarcastically
im lonesome so im a drunk

im lonesome so im a thief a fornicator a whore monger

odaniel laughs with him

say why dont we get right down on our knees now

i prayed in saloons i prayed in the street i prayed an the toilet
he dont care where what he wants is that prayer
odaniel drops on all fours crawling to find the plug of an electric cord
he shoves it into a wall socket switches off the overhead light and suddenly a hollow tinted plastic jesus glows on the dresser
a revivalist congregation sings
and now we notice with joe placards and flags horns and tracts all the paraphernalia of a street corner evangelist
thats the ticket just open your heart and let it flow
it aint the words its the love beyond em
sally buck sings with the congregation while a rawboned preacher stands in the river preparing to immerse little joe
dont fight it boy
odaniel tries to pull joe down beside him
pray and you shall be heard
camera becomes little joe glimpsing the fevered faces of sally buck and the congregation singing on the riverbank just before being plunged under the river
odaniels voice reechoes filtered through water
dont be frightened son
joe runs in aimless panic pushing through the crowd pursued by odaniels voice and the singing congregation
dont run from jesus
joe stops short as he sees the front page of a tabloid on a newsstand
there is a picture of joe being led away by two deputies under a headline alabama murderer shotguns eleven
joe searches the faces of the crowd running forward suddenly as he sees jackie and the farmboy picked up by two men in a large convertible
joe chases the car to eighth avenue but stops frightened as he sees himself in multiple image on the front of every newspaper displayed on a newsstand
the saloon is almost empty during the after dinner lull
the bartender doesnt look up from his newspaper as joe approaches
say you know that runty little bastard i was with
i dont know nothing
joe tenses as he sees the
tabloid picture of himself on the back of the bartenders paper
joes hand closes around an empty beer bottle a terrible violence surging very near the surface
reflected in the mirror we see little joe wildly smashing bottles and glass display cabinets the voices of women screaming o
little joe hurling a perfume bottle which shatters the mirror and his own image
the empty beer bottle stands where it was
joe has disappeared
on the tv screen over the bar sound drowned out by the jukebox we see a blowup of the tabloid photograph revealing a young man very similar to but clearly
colorful lights still flash seductive promise
the vertical lights on the mony tower reach bottom and freeze momentarily
joe at his hotel window staring out blankly
gun fire o
the radio at joes ear is drowned out by a kid in cowboy hat shooting alone in the gallery
two policemen idly slap their thighs with night sticks
joe moves on unconsciously checking the coin return box of a pay phone
joe curled up on his bed like a baby fully dressed his radio on the night stand
his love theme remote hollow
joes radio is at his ear
never too late to look great bens bargain basements open till five a
miles and miles of western styles worth more at any store money talks and nobody walks
for the first time joe is aware of the other midnight cowboys lurking in doorways the cruising queens the middle age men in sport shirts
joe moves on self consciously as he sees a scar faced policeman unconsciously massaging his night stick
camera holds on a window display of gag buttons featuring new york will break your heart joe soaking in the tub eyes closed
joes radio promises job opportunities for young men eighteen to twenty five in the u
he stands with a crowd staring up at a girl go go dancing in the window of sergeant joe staring in the mirror
static over his love theme
by work light the tarrier in metal helmet leans on a jack hammer beyond the sign dig we must drowning out joes radio
joe flexing his muscles in his jockey shorts while live on tv screen a physical culture personality finishes push ups and starts pitching his own extra protein bread
joes radio continues the super break commercial while a fry cook flips flapjacks in the window
but joes eyes are on a sign dishwasher wanted
joe looks up and his eyes meet those of the young man scraping garbage behind the counter
joe sits in the hotel lobby staring out at the street unable to concentrate on his comic book
on two way radio a womans voice giggles as she speaks when i cant sleep well i just dial the time and listen to those old seconds clicking by like
you know counting sheep
joe watches a young man hold a taxi door for an older lady at the same corner where ratso waved to another young man
the womans predatory eyes linger momentarily on joe before she leads the young man into the cafe
the two way radio continues over
thats what i do about insomnia
well now maam next time you got that feeling coming on you dial joe buck
ill show you what to do
joe straddles a chair staring at a blank tv screen
need a little easy money
its e z
want a little easy cash
its e z
as the jingle continues we follow joe and his radio into the loan office the depressing reality photographed and edited in the style of a tv commercial easy locations to
get to easy ladies to greet you easy chairs to seat you easy payments to meet let e z set you on easy street joe arrives confident harassed e z receptionist lines of uneasy customers desperate angry faces reams of e z forms to fill clerks sneer says joe has to be kidding joes image frozen as if another still photograph standing at the desk waiting for his key
action continues as the desk clerk hands joe a folded paper instead of a key
joe opens it deeply perplexed
looks like you been locked out of your room buddy
till you pick up your tab
uh what about my thingsn all
we keep them nice and safe till you get this straightened out
room warm and inviting joes suitcase on the bed
listen tell you what you can keep all the rest of the goddam junk if you let me have just the suitcase
that suitcase means a lot to me
the postcard photograph marked x this is me
we keep everything
joe stands outside the hotel stunned seeing the bright colored lights turn suddenly grey
the film continues in black and white as joe walks into the crowd
the for rent sign flapping in the wind
joe nurses a short beer like the regulars
he looks up as a crippled panhandler approaches vaguely reminiscent of ratso
the bed turned back clean sheets a soft night light
joe is stretched on a bench his stetson over his eyes
a loud speaker announces a bus departing for texas but joe does not move
a policeman taps joes boots with his night stick
joe rises and starts away with mixed anger and apprehension
two matching ivy leaguers exchange a glance as they see joe washing his feet in the basin
joe stares back with a belligerent grin
any objection gentlemen
joe balances a cup of coffee walking past the other solitary night people avoiding each others eyes
joe spots what hes looking for and seats himself next to a gaunt woman and her ten year old son both freaked out erratically touching things themselves each other in
a futile effort to make contact with reality
but joe is only concerned with the plastic wrapped crackers left by their empty soup bowls
yaint gonna eat them
the woman stares at joe blankly
the boy runs a toy mouse across the table up his mothers arm and around her face
with a polite nod joe opens the crackers and squirts one with ketchup
joe upsets his chair as a great gob of ketchup spills onto his pants
glancing around with an embarrassed laugh but the only one looking is a cop scratching his calf with a night stick
joe keeps his back to the customers as he moves to the water dispenser wets a paper napkin and tries to wipe away the stain
but the water has only spread the stain across his pants and down his leg
he blushes as a blonde young streetwalker giggles
wet your britches lover boy
joe tries to hide the stain with his jacket as he checks the coin boxes of vending machines wary as he passes a burly policeman abstractedly snapping his handcuffs in
front of a bakery window display of bride and groom wedding cakes
joe barely glances at a confused middle age lady
how do i get to grand central
follow the green light
automatically checking the trough of a gum vending machine joe unexpectedly faces himself in the mirror the eyes staring at him tired and hopeless
his hand reaches unconsciously for a cigarette the package is empty
he crumples it in his fist but holds it
enough of this shee it
you know what you got to do
nods then go do it
joe hurls the crumpled package into a dont be a litterbug basket as he emerges from the subway his radio at his ear
the torchy voice belts his love song merging with street noises crying danger an ambulance a burglar alarm a policemans whistle the lights flashing lurid color for the first time
since joe was locked out no longer promising but threatening clashing warning as
from a high angle across the street joe joins the other midnight cowboys offering himself to all comers
his figure is momentarily obliterated by traffic then
zooming in we see joe self consciously trying to hide the stain on his pants embarrassed as a large sedan slows then moves on to stop in front of a
joe is briefly obliterated again by a passing police car
the receding flash of its turret light revealing joe in close conversation with a frightened young fat boy whose eyes plead for reassurance as joe scowls
joes black and white suitcase gleams on the bed
twenty three bucks i got to have twenty three bucks
from an apparently empty balcony an old science fiction film grinds endlessly through the night a lost spaceman trying to make contact with a tantalizing martian maiden across an invisible
time barrier theremin voices calling earthling where are you
i got twenty five
at the top of the balcony joe leans back turning his face away as the fat boy embraces him kissing joes cheek and neck his head moving down out of
frame to show on the screen the spaceman and martian maiden meeting arms outstretched
but the martian maiden moves right on through the spaceman crying earthling come back however many centuries it is ill wait
joe closes his eyes forcing his memory back
repeating the remembered image of anastasia and a younger joe behind the movie screen
youre the only one joe the only only one ever
the remembered passion continuing mounting intercut with flash impressions like flipping pages of a nudie magazine naked half draped blondes gazing into camera with sultry eyes including one comic strip
sexpot and the calendar girl in joes texas hotel room
youre the best the very best yes yes kiss me oh god please kiss me joe now now now
joes face in extreme close up sounds of both movie houses merging confused dominated by the voices of adolescent boys
hey joe give someone else a chance
whats he doing for chrisake
he kissing anastasia
you better swallow a whole goddam drugstore man
an adolescent ratpack waiting in line behind the screen laughing in coarse whispers watching joe and anastasia
theremin voices call earthling where are you
on screen the martian maiden moves through the spaceman crying earthling come back however many centuries it is ill wait
joe watches the fat boy doubled over retching
im awful damn sorry youre sick kid but you gonna have to gimme that money like you said
i was lying
i dont have it
whatre you going to do to me
controls fury what you got in your pockets
eagerly the boy produces a family photograph a subway token a dirty handkerchief
joe grabs his wrist revealing a watch
how muchs that worth
i cant go home without my watch
my motherd die
take my books
not my watch
but joe has already kicked open the door
theremin voices drown out the fat boy calling earthling where are you
joe sprawls trying to sleep his feet on the balcony rail the radio at his ear
on screen once again the martian maiden moves through the spaceman crying but we hear the voice of a desperate woman on two way radio
as she speaks a policeman moves along the aisle slapping his palm with his night stick
bill can i call you bill mister bonner
i feel like i know you from listening
what i called about bill im gonna kill myself
from a high angle only joes stetson and radio can be seen above a passing bus its side panel advertising bill bonners why call me baby
if you want to do it just do it dont talk about it
are we drunky
feeling a little sorry for ourselves maybe
joe appears in full figure as the bus passes
he stands looking at the suitcases in a luggage shop window
well bill what i got thinking i didnt want the neighbors to have to find me this young couple with the boy i want to have my cat see bill
bonner tough in a grey crew cut talks on the phone
okay baby now listen just hold on while i leave the line for a minute
and think about all the kids that are dying overseas for you okay baby
ill be back in exactly sixty seconds
after this message from
a taxi born blasts interrupting the sponsors message
joes fist slams a fender violently using ratsos fake injury trick to stop traffic running across the street toward
ratso staring out at joe paralyzed in the act of lighting a cigarette intercut in flashing close ups joe outside the window ratso inside reflecting their conflicting emotions joes murderous
rage ratsos panic one almost subliminal flash of each revealing something like pleasure at finding a long lost friend
ratso staring up into camera holding his breath
dont hit me im a cripple
joes hand falls on ratsos shoulder
oh i aint gonna hit you im gonna strangle you to death
the cigarette in ratsos mouth burns into his lip
he jerks spasmodically choking on smoke as he rips skin away with the butt and drops it in his coffee cup
only first im gonna turn you upside down and shake you out right here and now
coughing eyes tearing ratso empties his pockets on the counter finally producing sixty four cents a few sticks of gum an almost empty cigarette package a book of matches and
two pawn tickets
he raises his eyes somehow ashamed
joe kicks the toe of ratsos loafer
whats in your socks
not a cent i swear to god i swear on my mothers eyes
ratso removes his loafers and shakes them glancing at the counter man
his socks dont even conceal his toes
disgusted joe shoves ratsos small pile back at him
you keep the sixty four cents
i want you to have it
what you do slobber on em
i wouldnt touch em
joe should leave ratso obviously has nothing tangible to offer but joe hesitates lighting a cigarette as ratso pulls on his loafers
how do you like that odaniel flipping out like that
i wanted to get in touch with you when i heard but i been laid up with this cold
ratso touches his chest forcing a cough which continues itself beyond his intention
you want some free medical advice shut your goddam mouth about that night
okay right right okay
where you living
still at the hotel
the black and white suitcase lies open on the bed
joe turns abruptly and walks away
i got better things to do than talk to you
joe strides north pretending he doesnt hear
hey wait up for crissake
ratso hop skipping to overtake joe at the traffic light
listen keep away from me hear
you come near me again i snatch you bald headed
im inviting you
i mean if youre not located i got a place
im inviting you goddamit
you inviting shee it
a contractors sign announces luxury apartments available in high rise co op under construction beyond a raw of tenements with xs taped on the windows
ratsos voice continues over the click clack click of joes boots and the flip flap squeak of ratsos loafers as camera moves toward a condemned building
the x on the window means the landlord cant collect rent which is a convenience hey
on account of its condemned
footsteps climb past rubbish piled outside empty flats
the electrics off
i dont mess with con edison hey
what the hell i got candles right
light from the x window shines on a florida tourist poster as ratso leads joe into an abandoned tub in kitchen flat barely furnished with a table and chair a
rumple of blankets on a burnt out mattress
i got no heat but by that time you know cold weather hey ill be in florida
make yourself comfortable
ill put up some water for coffee
ratso fills a saucepan from the tub sink sets it on a sterno stove
joe sits himself on the mattress bed pretending to test it weeks of exhaustion and tension overwhelming him suddenly his only immediate problem being the effort to restrain a large
comfortable kee rist i slept on subways softer than this
joe stretches himself yawning his eyelids drooping heavily
the sounds of the city recede
joes love theme plays softly on a distant radio
joes eyes close momentarily in spite of him elf
a vintage dashboard radio dial glowing anastasias face
love me joe
a huge metal ball arcs on chain demolishing a brick facade
ratsos face seems to radiate evil as he lights a sterno can
joe forces his eyes half open
smart thing for me to do is haul ass outta here
whatsa matter now
joe shivers pulls a blanket around him resisting sleep but the noises of demolition fade the love theme lures joe back
you dont seem like no fag
whats that supposed to mean
joes eyes close his voice continuing out of half sleep
want me to stay here yafter something
joes thumbnail flares a match exposing anastasia on the car seat with joe both nearly naked
anastasia butterfly kisses joes chest as he lights a cigarette
say you love me
just say it
i love you
anastasia purrs as her lips find joes breast trying to nurse
a flashlight flares suddenly through the car window
low angle ratso bending over joe into camera
sally buck shocked hand still on switch
joe blinded by halation
anastasias mouth screaming soundlessly
flashlights multiplying on car window

anastasia catatonic in courtroom between parents who are now odaniel and sally buck
drawling voice evidence of repeated violations
bill bonner in flag cloth judges robe
police advancing swinging night sticks
joe running into times square suddenly naked
anastasia sitting in all night cafeteria
freaky child running toy mouse over her naked body
siren screaming anastasia staring catatonic from rear window of ambulance
ambulance racing away
joe chasing naked after ambulance
running into the arms of the police
ratso laughing as police beat joe
joe awakens in a cold sweat fighting the blankets wild eyed as he sees ratso at the table examining joes radio by candle light
joe lunges across the room to snatch the radio from ratsos hands
still wild eyed joe suddenly points at his stocking feet
wheres my boots
joe facing the crowd naked except for his boots
ratso points to the boots on the floor by the mattress
howd they get off me
i took em off
so you could sleep
i mean christ
joe inspects the boots seats himself on a battered army cot which has been added while he slept swinging a boot by its strap considering whether to stay or go
i drug in a cot if you want to stay
well now ratso im gonna tell you something for your own good only first gimme a cigarette
ratso offers a cigarette from his crushed package joe strikes a match on his thumbnail and lights up staring at ratso
you want me to stay here tonight is that the idea
i aint forcing you like i mean whos forcing you
guess i got the wrong impression
joe makes a slow move to pull on one boot
i want you to stay okay
i goddam invited you didnt i
well i hope you know what youre in for
im a very dangerous person
someone does me bad like you
if i caught up with you that night thered be one dead ratso long about now
youre a killer
so if you want me to hang around for a few days i thought you should know
joe yawns picks up a few blankets and spreads them on the cot
he puzzles out the faded printing on one blanket
property of the ymca
you make me wanna puke sometimes ratso
ratso blows out the candle and wraps himself in blankets
joe do me one favor this is my place am i wrong
you know in my own place my name aint ratso
i mean it so happens my name is enrico salvatore rizzo
shee it man i cant say all that
rico then at least call me rico in my own goddam place
is that enough
then and keep your meat hooks off my radio
ratso wears a threadbare raincoat of faded black several sizes too large as he shops with housewives at a sidewalk vegetable stand elbowing his way through the ladies testing fruit
picking up vegetables and putting them back till the greengrocer spots him
i told you i calla cops
the other shoppers deliberately turn their backs avoiding involvement
as the greengrocer grabs ratso joe ambles into the scene wearing his dangerous little smile
hey looka here that aint nice picking on a cripple
joe intervenes just long enough for ratso to escape then ambles on leaving the greengrocer in frustrated fury
camera holds on a tray of coconuts
joe lies on his cot watching ratso struggle to penetrate the fibrous husk of a coconut experimenting with a variety of rusty tools in an old cigar box
the two basic items necessary to sustain life are sunshine and coconut milk
thats a known fact
if i can find the goddam hole the milk squirts out
this is an okay setup you got here but id say you aint just exactly uh flush is that right or not
i been sick
hold this will ya
joe takes his time rising to hold the coconut while ratso tries to poke a hole with a bent ice pick
in florida they come smooth ready to eat
down there your only problem is diet wise you gotta lift an arm to wipe warm milk off your chin
i think finding yous the smartest thing i ever did for both of us
you just the crooked kinda sneaky little sidewinder i need to get me hustling in this town
joe jerks his hand away just in time to avoid the ice pick
the coconut bounces on the floor
ratso picks it up holds it while joe tries to crack it swinging his boot like a hammer
miami beach is the only place for a real hustler
florida has more rich chicks per square yard than any resort spot in the world
they lie out in their pagodas and pergolas waiting to grab the first jockstrap that passes
whats all this sweet talk about florida
your friend odaniel got a stable down there now
joe swings violently
ratso yelps hopping on his one good leg sucking his thumb
break my finger christ
i got news for you baby no chick with any class buys that big dumb cowboy crap
ratso holds his thumb under the tub sink faucet
the cowboy bits out except among fags of a certain type which take a certain type hustler to exploit
like i could handle it being a stealing operation basically but take your average fag very few of them want a cripple
joe holds the coconut like yoricks skull thinking hard
well i am dumb thats for sure
i dont talk right
i cant think too good
just only one thing i ever been good fors loving
women go crazy for me
had to send her away
so i dont cash in on that what am i
im shee it
mays well flush me down that hole with the dishwater
joe sets the coconut on the floor holding it with both hands while he tries to smash it with the heel of his boot
thats why you gonna stop crapping about florida and get your skinny butt moving to earn twenty bucks worth of management you owe me
the suitcase lies open displaying joes wardrobe
make that twenty three bucks
joe slams his heel down
the coconut shoots out from under him and he lands on his ass
look at yourself joe no offense but frankly youre beginning to smell
for a stud in this town thats a handicap
you talk like a man with a tin twat
ratso sets the coconut on the window sill balancing it as he raises the x window
you aint got a chance in hell
you need threads and glitter baby
a front hey
well uh my managers gonna manage all that crap or else he gonna get a coconut up his flue
joe slams the window down
the coconut flies down to crash o
on the sidewalk below
an alley cat laps up the milk of the broken coconut
joe stands naked in the middle of traffic
a siren shrills
anastasia catatonic in a hospital smock moves toward joe like a sleepwalker passing through him
wearing only his boots joe sits like an indian chief wrapped in a blanket angle widening to show ratso spotting joes jacket slacks and shirt with cleaning fluid his eyes
on a very pregnant italian lady
as she starts to load a coin cleaning machine ratso intervenes solicitously speaking in italian
a woman in your condition shouldnt do that
let me help
adroitly slipping joes cleaning in with her load as she turns to seat herself beside joe
it aint right stealing from a pregnant lady
joe and ratso stand waiting at the counter
what did it cost her
the laundromat syndicate lost a couple coins
the owner brings joes clean and blocked stetson from the rear of the shop
joe sets it on his head and examines himself in a mirror as the owner hands ratso the bill
the black homburg
i brought it in the same time
the owner glances at the slip puzzled returns to the rear of the shop to search for the nonexistent homburg
ratso quickly drags joe away from the mirror and out of the shop
the rhythmic duet of boots and loafers follows joe and ratso checking coin boxes and telephone booths till they reach a shoeshine stand locked for the night
they loiter till a young couple has disappeared then joe kicks loose the padlock on the equipment drawer mounts one of the chairs and ratso goes to work on his
boots with furious expertise flourishing double brushes snapping the rag like a jazz drummer
hey youre good
i bet you could pick up a living at this if you tried
and end up a hunchback like my old man
you think im crippled
you shoulda caught him the end of a day
ratso demonstrates a chimpanzee walk
ratso turns back in panic as another man takes a chair next to joe
ratso is about to retuse when a cop takes the third chair swinging his handcuffs around to the front tapping his shoe with his night stick
ratso quickly drops a rag over the broken padlock cursing under his breath as he starts working on all three customers at the same time
you think its funny
joe is seated in a straight back chair near the x window a towel tucked around his neck as ratso trims his hair almost as expert a barber as shoeshine
stupid bastard coughed his lungs out breathing that resin all day
they buried him with gloves on
even the fag undertaker couldnt get his nails clean
as if by conditioned reflex ratso chokes on the cigarette in his mouth coughing painfully
he crushes it out opens the window to spit shivering then slam it and turns back to remove the towel from joes neck
kee rist you pretty damn clever for a skimpy little gimp
you like it
take a look
dont rush me
how i do it see i get myself primed like i was turning on the charm for some pretty little blonde lady then kinda mosey away slow and easy and
and there you are you handsome devil
joe performs his ritual as he speaks but more relaxed faintly laughing at himself with ratso
the wall mirror has been added since we last saw the flat along with a legless overstuffed chair with burnt out cushions a tasselled table cover pinups calendar girls and
several new florida tourist posters ratso moves to joes side arranging the neckerchief nodding
not bad for a cowboy youre okay youre okay
what im gonna do im gonna make a cowboy outta you kid
how about that
build you up a little teach you couple little tricksn turn yout to stud rat stuff
joe slaps his hat on ratsos head tilts it hooks ratsos thumbs in his jeans and shoves a cigarette into the corner of ratsos mouth
ratso laughs till he chokes for one instant self consciously mimicking joe then removes the hat and reaches for his threadbare black raincoat
okay you got yourself one handsome sweet smelling cowboy strut your stuff
joe and ratso peer down through a basement bay window into the office of the perfect gentleman escort service endorsed by leading travel agencies and credit clubs offering discreet companionship
and personal guided tours in any language
a large busted matron on a french phone fills out a memo and hands it to an immaculate young escort who slips the memo into his topcoat pocket as he
comes from the office and hails a cab
ratso darts forward limping exaggeratedly holding the door lifting the memo as he brushes off the escorts topcoat
the young man waves him away with out a tip
ratso slams the door and bites his thumb after the cab unfolding the memo as he joins joe on the sidewalk
how do you like that
reads then i think we struck gold
this is one high class chick
the barbizon for women
the mutual of new york tower flashes mony
ratso consults the memo as he speaks into the phone
mcneill im calling for miss beecham at the barbizon hotel for women
she wont need you tonight
a doorman helps a young lady into a limousine
would you believe a whole goddam hotel with nothing but lonely chicks
joe and ratso watch from across the street
score once in that setup the way chicks talk christ
joe cracks his gum tilts his hat starts across the street
get the money
remember cass trehune
these rich bitches write a check at night call the bank and stop payment in the morning
get the cash
in ratsos eyes as joe enters the hotel its facade suddenly wipes away to reveal rich ladies in negligee waiting in every room
joe starts up the stairs two at a time
a bellhop grabs him
no men upstairs
ratso warms his hands at a chestnut vendors cart seeing
zoom close up a lady in a window grabbing joe
joe picks up a house phone watched by the bellhop
ratso sees joe zip from room to room in wild animation
the lobby watches joe blow a gum bubble at the elevator
staring at a window display of florida sportswear ratsos imagination soars seeing
ratso like a model in a travel poster in gaudy sport shirt talking on the phone against a background of hotels
ratso like james bond surrounded by bikinis dictating while girls serve coconut milk and massage his game leg
ratso like george raft in evening clothes running a posh casino flicking a coin
ratso simply himself dressed as he is sitting on the beach at peace in the sun
the same identical picture with joe sitting beside ratso
joe faces miss beecham a reserved and rather plain young lady in evening dress she tries to speak softly
im afraid theres been a terrible mistake
ratso leans against the window flipping a coin
miss beecham is flushed with humiliation the entire lobby watching joe in the hands of two bellboys
i want my money goddamit you owe me my money whether you get laid or not lady shee it
the lights in the window suddenly switch off blacking out florida
ratso glances toward the growl of a siren o
a police prowl car slows in front of the hotel
ratso swings across the street with incredible speed to meet joe as hes tossed onto the sidewalk
ratso picks up the stetson and brushes it off then helps joe to his feet
from a high angle the two figures move slowly along the deserted avenue their rhythmic musical duet growing more and more faint in the distance a broken grasshopper and a
six foot tarnished cowboy passing a tuxedo rental store next to a lighted sign temperature in miami beach florida degrees their pace slowing to a dead stop
joe and ratso frozen rain on the x windowpane freezing into sheet ice
a radio commercial plays warm sentimental music while a cozy voice explains how easy it is to heat with humble oil
joe and ratso frozen in a narrow shaft of sunlight watching the huge metal ball demolish the building next door
a radio announcer sells frozen sunshine orange juice
joe and ratso frozen staring significantly at joes radio
a singing commercial dont wheeze and sneeze the winter away
drink frozen sunshine every day
through the window joe and ratso watch the pawnbroker examine joes radio be healthier wealthier life can be fine when you drink frozen sunshine is clicked off by the pawnbroker
joe and ratso frozen wrapped in blankets as
the canned heat dies with a faint puff
water dripping in the tub sink freezes into an icicle
the candle burns down and out leaving the screen dark
joe and ratso warm themselves on the smoke and steam rising from a subway grating watching two officials in fur collared coats inspect the front of their x flat building
reading their doom joe and ratso continue on disappearing into the subway
joe stands alone watching the midnight cowboys ply their trade
camera pulls back as joe turns away and enters a store front blood bank offering ten dollars to blood donors
a huge hypodermic fills the frame sucking joes blood
ratso coughs uncontrollably
ratso leans over the tub sink dry heaving while he coughs wearing a sheepskin coat much too large for him
he controls the cough with effort hearing the door open and close o
wipes his mouth and turns to grin at
joe trying to light the empty sterno can deliberately ignoring ratso
ratso shrugs washes his mouth at the faucet finds a cigarette butt and lights it careful to avoid inhaling the first puff
cough yourself inside out then light a fag a goddam fag
you make me puke
whered you steal it
in the movies
a guy i did a favor once gave it to me
whod you ever do a favor for
you just let some poor bastard freeze to death wouldnt you
joe slams ten dollars on the table
ratso glances at joe with curious concern
whered that come from
forty second street
wheren hell you think it come from
you wanna know the truth
you dumb bastard i got it for you
look at it
goddam things ten sizes too big for me
ratso pulls off the coat and throws it at joe
wear it yourself
i wouldnt put it on my back
joe throws it back at ratso
goddamned if ill wear it
ratso hurls it in a corner
joe shoves the ten at ratso
go get your medicine
before you die on my goddam hands
high angle joe and ratso cross an foot chilled by wind neither wearing the sheepskin coat
the queens riverfront and factories appear cold and bleak deserted on sunday
camera moves into acres of tombstones piled like low rent housing projects for the dead the various faiths segregated by crumbling boundaries
i hate boneyards
he aint your goddam father
ratso leads joe past a negro family at a grave glances around snatches an elaborate floral piece from a headstone and hides it under his black raincoat as he darts
toward a low dividing wail and swings himself over into
an endless section of plain stone markers
joe touches his hat to two nuns guiltily hurrying to overtake ratso at ibis fathers grave indistinguishable from the other graves except for the name on the headstone
ratso places the floral piece on the grave with almost absurd solemnity
kee rist you sure are one twisty little bastard ratso
the names rico at my own fathers grave a man deserves some respect
respect shee it
you even steal flowers for his grave
can he smell the difference eh
joe reads from the ribbon on the floral display
well uh he dam well know he aint be loved aunt winifred
he cant read
even dumber than you
couldnt write his own name
x thats what it ought to say there on that goddam headstone
one big lousy x like our flat
by order of city hall
joe is frowning standing at the headstone momentarily depressed with an undefined sorrow
my grammaw sally buck she died without letting me know
through the window past the for rent sign the tarnishing driers are lined up like tombstones
joe frowns puzzled as ratso pulls out a black skullcap leading joe toward a group of professional mourners whispering just keep your hat on and cry a little
they tip you when its over
joe and ratso join the mourners as the funeral moves to the grave ratso mouthing an authentic double talk
joe standing self consciously aware of the covert glances of the other mourners automatically reaching up to remove his hat remembering when ratso elbows him in the ribs
joe scowling tight lipped embarrassed by the tip that is thrust in his hand
a weary santa claus in a rented beard and over large costume warms his hands over the steam of his coffee cup
joe and ratso are arguing farther down the counter
just aint right cheating someone dead and cant cheat back
in the background as ratso speaks hansel and gretel macalbertson enter the lunch counter inspecting the customers one by one
both wear black turtlenecks and jeans dressed as twins both blond and pretty
you and my old man
same kinda mind
putting me down till the day he died
mimics why cant you be like your brothers
sons a father could be proud of
too goddam busy making something of themselves to show up when the old mans dying
conditioned reflex ratso starts to cough
joe sees the macalbertsons in the mirror standing behind him studying him
gretel nods hansel hands joe a large black card smiling vaguely then moves on
what was that all about
joe studies the black card frowning at first suddenly smiling turning as if to call after the macalbertsons but they are disappearing around the corner
joe hands the card to ratso
you wanna read something read this
i been invited somewhere
shocking pink letters on the black card read you are invited they picked me
the only one in the whole goddam place
you see how they looked me over up and down before they give me that
joe sees a young man washing cups behind the counter
joe shakes his head wonderingly turning to study himself in the mirror
well this thought just struck me
it wasnt too long ago i was washing dishes way the hell somewhere in texas
yeah well so
now im here
im in new york city
getting picked for things
dont you see what im driving at
what youre driving at you want me to get lost so you can go to your fancy ass party
did i say that
studies card it dont say nothing about you
dont say nothing about you either
but they picked me right
so what ill do ill just say now look you want me
well i dont go nowhere without my buddy here
shrugs well what the hell i got nothing better to do
snow swirls in the aureole of a street light as joe and ratso run heads lowered turning into
a drab entrance hall dimly lit signs identifying various commercial tenants a pink on black placard reading macalbertson two flights up
joe has started up before he notices ratso leaning on the bannister at the foot of the stairs struggling to catch his breath
his face and hair are wet with perspiration his lips lavender blue
in swift flashes intercut joe reads the panic in ratsos eyes so intense that joe shares it unable to speak or offer reassurance
better dry your hair some
you sweating all over the goddam place
joe pulls out his shirttail grabs ratso by the neck and rubs his head dry
you got a comb
dont need a comb
few dozen cooties wont kill me dont guess
joe hands ratso his own comb
ratso swipes at his tangled hair angrily until two teeth break in the comb
he hands the comb back tugs at his hair with his fingers pats it in place then looks back into joes eyes
i look okay
in a moment of silence distant sounds can be heard a siren the grinding teeth of a garbage truck the twang of an electric guitar upstairs at the party then
ratso makes a quick gesture of impatience and starts up the stairs pulling himself on the bannister
a bank of lights blinds joe and ratso as they enter electronic rock blasts their ears a bearded cameraman on a step ladder photographs them as they stand confused facing
a monstrous collage of tabloid photos blown up showing the murder of a hippie known as groovy in huge black letters love was groovy groovy is dead
joe shouts over the amplified music
better get a hold of someone and tell them im here
ratso points to his ear he cant hear following joe across the room
the huge loft is crowded with a random selection gathered to serve as dress extras in an underground film
the party is the scene
the macalbertsons merely supply the ingredients and allow it to happen with cameras strategically placed to record the happening
hansel with tape recorder gretel with hand held camera drifting through the crowd catching words and images in a detached whimsical fashion
gretel turns her camera on joe and ratso as they approach
well i made it
this here is ratso rizzo and i
gretel smiles without recognition
hansel gestures vaguely
do you need anything
i mean theres beer and so forth
whatever your thing is
the twins move away together pausing to confer with the operator of a tripod camera focused on an emaciated flower girl with long hair and dirty feet stretched in a
sarcophagus clutching a dead daffodil her eyes glazed
scrawled in huge letters on the wall over her head love
if you want the word on that brother and sister act ill give you the word
that hansels a fag and gretels got the hots for herself
so who cares right
load up on the salami
ratso heads for the refreshment table
joe starts after him but pauses intrigued by an alcove under the balcony where a light show is in progress surreal images of naked bodies projected against abstract currents of
color and strobe light
a bored fat lady in a muu muu squatted like a buddha at a low table rolling joints for the guests
she lights a joint and offers it to joe as he wanders in to watch the show
joe laughs delightedly when he realizes what it is
shee it this is one helluva party
glancing around at the others imitating their techniques the quick inhaler who follows with sharp gulps of air the deep inhalers who draw air as they inhale the stylist who
lets the smoke drift out and inhales through the nostrils joe puffing himself slightly dizzy starting to laugh at the silent flick effect of the strobe light the action around him slowing almost imperceptibly overcranked a veil of smoke hanging over the fat womans face transforming her into a laughing witch a similar veil around joes head relaxing the self conscious tension of his face spontaneously curious about the play of light on his hand grinning at
a serious young technician handling the light show scattering psychedelic stars across a sky of magenta flesh
joe reaching for the stars as he rises and wanders back to the crowded loft fascinated to see
a crew with cameras and lights on the balcony at one end of the loft photographing the scene below
a dark haired lady by the name of shirley chic in the style of a gangsters moll drinking beer from the bottle predatory eyes searching the crowd
ratso surreptitiously stuffing his pockets from the buffet table glancing nervously over his shoulder unaware of gretel and her hand held camera photographing ratso as he steals turning away casually
joe laughing as he dances for a moment with a tall black girl the lights swinging around them faces swimming
shirley in fleeting close up gone in an instant reappearing
her face in the mirror smiling in a dark provocative way joe standing at the bathroom door forgetting to be embarrassed as shirley turns away from the mirror unhurriedly running
her fingers through her hair boldly meeting joes eyes
i can tell cant you
yeah oh yeah
whatll we do
leave now or what
your place or mine
oh god the second i looked at you i knew
joe grins watching shirleys lips move unable to keep her in sync startled to hear ratsos voice
joe realizes he is back at the party ratso whispering hoarsely
id say she was good for ten bucks but ill ask for twenty
but joe is watching with terrible fascination as hansel and gretel lift the flower girl from her sarcophagus
did you know
we were going to make it
joe glances down to see himself flanked by ratso and shirley
you really want to do business
dont tell me you two are a couple
the flower girl hypnotically dazed accepts a broom dipped in black paint and smears a huge x across love
why are you laughing joe
hansel holds a microphone toward joe who shrugs grinning at ratso and shirley
gretels camera moves down joes body
are you for real joe
well i aint a freal cowboy but im one hell of a stud
shirley glances at ratso who nods whispering in her ear
a very expensive stud
and i happen to be his manager
the scene from joes viewpoint becomes increasingly confusing and fragmented dialogue and image moving in and out of focus cameras and lights surrounding him keeping the center of attention in
his own blown mind
shirleys eyes unnaturally bright inspecting his body lingering on his thighs moistening her lips
its too much to come face to face with a walking talking sex fantasy to buy a mans god
the tall black girl dancing in stroble light starting to remove her clothes gretel following her with a camera
i cant wait to tell my man monday
i should be taking notes
look at my arm
shirleys talon like fingernails caressing the gooseflesh on her tanned arm
i gotta sit down
i feel crummy
ratso stretched out on a victorian love seat the flower girl walking unsteadily passing out dead daffodils placing one in ratsos hand gretel photographing his reaction
eat it a man in your line of work has to keep his strength up
shirley bringing joe a massive sandwich on a paper plate watching him bite into it
its fantastic now i know everything you do has sexual implications
if i you know bought it could i take pictures of you naked
thats part of it isnt it kinky kinda things
the tall black girl and a few others are trying to promote an orgy
a scrofulous old wino dances spastically working his toothless gums preparing to expose himself to two girls dancing together
we want you joe
youve been chosen
five youths stand beside the sarcophagus two sailors two cycle freaks a weight lifter waiting to be pallbearers
joe joins them
all lights and cameras are turned on the slow funeral procession carrying the flower girl out of the loft to the tune of moonlight and roses
strobe light adds to the unreality of the scene
i had a thing for him
before i knew
why should knowing make it more of a thing
shirley talks to gretel as she photographs the funeral
naturally ill have to ask myself why a cowboy
and why a cowboy whore
but not tonight
shirley is pulling her coat out of the pile on the bannister
incidentally how much is this going to cost me anyway
joe turns to ratso whose attention is fixed on the coats
tell her ratso
and taxi fare for me
and for that service i charge one dollar taxi fare
she takes a dollar from her purse and hands it to ratso takes joes arm and starts down the stairs
ratso lingers starting quickly through the coats frisking them for loose change
at the foot of the stairs shirley kisses joe violently
your names joe
which is fabulous
joe could be anyone
kiss me joe move over joe go away joe
its just perfect
they glance up as ratso appears swinging down too rapidly on the bannister
he misses a step and falls a clowns fall unable to stop but apparently not hurting himself
shirley and joe are laughing when ratso lands at the foot of the stairs
hey fella you fell
is he all right
rises mimics is he all right
well if youre awright why you hanging on the bannister
can you walk or not
naturally i can walk
hes got taxi fare
sure youre all right
shouts i said yeah
yeah yeah yeah
joe and shirley are kissing
shirley rolls away flushed fanning herself
joe rolls down the window
joe leans out of the taxi window waving his stetson bellowing at the snow
whoopee ti yi yo
ratso makes his way slowly from the building to the curb whistling between his teeth sharply hailing a cab
the cab slows to a stop
then the driver sees ratso shifts into gear and drives on
ratso bites his thumb after the cab rests for a moment on the lamp post then starts painfully inching his way along the deserted street
joe lies on his back staring fixedly at a fragile mobile hanging from the ceiling stirring listlessly
dont worry about it
shirley leans on one elbow looking at joe sympathetically fighting an almost irrepressible desire to laugh
still avoiding shirleys eyes joe finds a cigarette on the side table searches for matches
well thats something never happened to me before you can bet your bottom dollar
uh wheres the matches maam
maybe if you didnt call me maam things would work out better
joe finds the matches lights up and lies back staring at the mobile as he smokes still not looking at shirley
first goddam time it ever quit on me
the repressed laugh finally breaks through
shirley stifles it quickly as joe sits up looking at her
you think im lying
controls herself no
of course not
just something struck me funny
close on joe watching shirley closely reacting
i just put myself in your shoes
i had this image of a bugler without a horn a policeman without a stick etcetera etcetera and i
giggles i think id better shut up im making it worse
shirley composes her face reaching out to touch joe
but that doesnt help either
he reacts sharply
maybe we should take a little nap see what happens
i aint sleepy
extreme close up of joe frowning puzzled
camera pulling back to show joe concentrating on a game spread out on the sheet consisting of nine dice lettered on all sides the object being to build as many
words as possible scrabble fashion while a sand timer counts the seconds
shirley watches joes efforts to think with sympathetic amusement
the only word joe has composed so far is man
thats pretty freudian joe
its a perfectly good word aint it
how much time i got
glances up goddam sand thing drive you crazy
spelling never was a very strong point with me
even in school
if you didnt talk so much maybe you could think more
dont talk you get muddled in your head
now you just look at this here
joe spells out mony down from the m in man
theres an e in money
if thats your word
m o n y im right
thats just exactly how they spell it up there on that big building bet you could see it from here
m o n y
stifles giggle okay
never argue with a man
y what in hell starts with y
shirley slyly trails the tips of her fingernails across joes chest as she leans over to study the game breathing softly into his ear as she speaks
it can end in y day pay lay hey pay lay
one predatory hand rests on his knee as if by accident disarranging the sheet talon nails lightly brushing his thigh
cut it out
thats cheating teasing me so i cant think
just one bitsy y word and i gonna beat you
you gonna beat me joe
beat your butt you dont lemme think
gay ends in y
you like that gay fey is that your problem
i show you what problem but the end of his sentence is swallowed by shirley taking his kiss in her open mouth crushed by its impact an animal noise snarling
deep in her throat the agonized alley cat wail of pleasure joes problem is solved
joes love theme swells triumphant
at the same time shirley half rises trying to force joes head down her own on top
the issue is joined
shirley has named the game
her objective is to force joe onto his back
joes objective is to retain his initiative
camera ignores the classic action on the central front concentrating exclusively on peripheral tactical maneuvers
joes elbows pinning her shoulders
her eyes bright accepting the challenge
his tight smile revealing clenched teeth
her fingers searching out then tickling his underarm
joe laughing as he falls lopsidedly
shirley laughing triumphantly
his hand closing on her wrist
her talon nails clawing the air
her toes walking up his calf
her legs suddenly locking around his knees
her free hand grabbing his hair
her shoulder rising as she forces his head back
her lips pressing down on his
his hand swatting an unidentified mass of flesh
her eyes popping teeth clamping his ear lobe
his hand catching her ankle
her teeth losing the ear lobe as she screams
her foot appearing upside down beside her face
her talon nails furrowing flesh drawing blood
his head rearing back roaring
both rolling to the floor out of view
her feet suddenly flying up into view
her hand tugging rhythmically at the blanket
her other hand wildly exploring joes back
her ankles locking spasmodically
her eyes and mouth wide gaping
the blanket suddenly ripping free flying into the air as her arm flings itself around joe
the bedclothes spilling down around them muffling her ascending shrieks
whoopee ti yi yo
shirley has difficulty reverting to her nine to five role as a madison avenue career girl
half dressed for work she is talking on the telephone her eyes on the open door to the bathroom through which joes voice continues singing
well i really cant talk now if you know what i mean but believe me when i say myra its an experience every emancipated woman owes herself
im not exaggerating
well whats phils poker night
yells off joe are you available next thursday eight thirty
thoroughly shaved bathed and groomed joe is sprinkling an expensive cologne into his boots
he yells back enthusiastically
well lemme think now thursday eight thirty yeah i guess i could be available
shirley turns back to the phone
joe appears grinning
why dont you just come here
ill be working every night this week
ill leave a key with the super
well maam shirley i sure hate to trouble you but
shirley opens her purse savoring the moment
as she places the money in joes hand
joe slaps a bill on the counter admiring a fine new cowboy shirt in the mirror wriggling new white socks into his boots
suddenly remembering he goes to the sock rack and buys two pairs one large and one small
gradually dominating joes love theme recurs continuing over
joe slaps down money to pay for an assortment of medicine
joe takes the stairs two at a time to burst in on
ratso huddled in the overstuffed chair wearing the stolen sheepskin coat wrapped in blankets his teeth chattering in spite of the sweat on his forehead
joe stops abruptly his mood shattered by ratsos alarming condition
they simply stare at each other for a moment then joe turns away to see soup heating on the sterno stove
joe tosses one of his paper bags onto ratsos lap
see what you think of that crap
ill pour your soup
got some of that junk you like to swill too
all that shee it
ratso opens the paper bag trying to control his shivering pulling out the socks and a suit of long underwear
he sees joe watching him for a reaction
the best ratso can do is a slight shake of his head
but while you was buying the underwear i could have lifted the socks
you couldnt lift fly specks from a sugar bowl
can you hold this
joe hands ratso the soup
ratso seems steadied by the warmth in his hands
he nods sipping the soup
hesitates then hey joe dont get sore about this or anything
well i dont think i can walk
embarrassed i mean i been falling down a lot and uh
i mean what they do to you know do with you if you cant ah christ
i dont know
or the how should i know
ratso is trembling so violently that the sou starts to slop over
joe takes it and sets it on the table
here it is
you gonna go see the doctor
i got nine bucks and twenty more thursday and i gonna be riding high before you know it
so you gonna get you the best goddam doctor in this town and get yourself straightened out thats what
doctors are like goddam auto mechanics
fix one thing unplug another
operate for piles and while theyre there they unscrew your liver
my old man for gods sake wasnt any sickern i am when he went to the doctor
well just exactly what the hell you think youre gonna do
die on me
im going to florida thats my only chance
you know whats wrong with you
you got fevers
you kinky as a bedbug
how you gonna get to florida
ill find the money
if you just get me on the bus thats all i ask
just when everythings going my way you gotta pull a stunt like this
i dont even want you to go
whaddya think of that
i got other plans for my life than dragging around some dumb cowboy that thinks hes gods gift to women
one twenty buck trick and hes already the biggest stud in new york city
joe sets his stetson on his head
when i put you on that bus down to florida tonight thatll be the happiest day of my life
joe strikes a match with his thumbnail and watches it curl away while he waits hearing a phone ring
then the phone is answered by a womans voice
oh yeah well when will missus gardner be home
im a friend of hers a goddam good friend
shee it i cant wait till then
joe hangs up while the answering services voice is still talking
the match has burned out
joe flips it away
headline walter p
box takes new york by surprise
joe loiters outside a gag headline print shop his eyes following a man in homburg and chesterfield
joe lingers momentarily identifying with the violence in a jazz drummer his eyes searching for a pickup
joe tests his skills in a shoot down with a large metal cowboy and kills him a recorded voice sneaks got me
as the cowboy slumps
joe glances off as he hears polite applause
towny a stout round faced man clasps joes hand between both of his own like an old friend
how are you
more quietly townsend p
locke from chicago
call me towny
im here to attend a paper manufacturers convention and frankly to have a little fun dammit
towny grips joes elbow almost forcibly leading him away
townys face appears huge at joes shoulder
this is my first night in town and ill consider it a ghastly omen clouding my entire ten days if you dont consent to have dinner with me
anywhere you like
townys mouth continues speaking at an incredible rate but his words are drowned out momentarily by the grinder of a sanitation truck chewing up a discarded christmas tree with tinsel
clinging to it
towny is still talking when theyve passed the truck
never mind how youre dressed
they know me
ill say youre with the rodeo
theres always a rodeo in new york dammit
besides you look very elegant
joe hardly notices odaniel on a far cornet his whining scarcely audible
ye are the salt of the earth jesus said but if the salt hath lost its savor wherewith shall it be salted
but dammit all i just remembered well have to eat in my room because i have this phone call coming at nine thirty
an ancient open cage lift
what i like about you youre such a wonderful conversationalist
so wont that be nice to have dinner sent up
a threadbare carpeted but spacious hallway
fifty years ago this was the only hotel in manhattan
my mother always calls me at her bedtime so ive got to be there
the room has little to recommend it except its size and large french window through which ignored by joe the mutual tower flashes mony
towny waves joe toward the couch quickly slipping several physical culture magazines from the coffee table onto a shelf beneath
ive got some nice gin
if youd prefer something else theyll send it up
its so exciting
the mad forward thrust of everything
my sense of time here is completely altered
joe carries ratso down the stairs wrapped in a blanket
the coffee table is littered with empty cartons of chinese food soaked through with brown sauce
joe finds the last egg roll and eats it as townys voice drones on
sometimes it seems to me time stopped twenty years ago
there was this war there was this handsome young man with quite black hair and he was supposed to die
but he didnt
isnt that amusing
townys dialogue moves out of sync
townys eyes seem to look into camera from joes viewpoint but slightly past it
the quality of the scene grows increasingly disjointed as joe glances around the room looking for something to steal losing personal contact with towny viewing him as an object to
be used for a specific purpose
enough about me
im through talking for the evening
now i want to hear about conditions in the west
the romance of the west holds a tremendous power over me
mother was actually a pioneer woman can you believe it
when she calls ill introduce you and shell be so thrilled
ratso sits an a stoop while joe hails a cab
townys voice is only a shrill monotone from here joe searches with increasing desperation for something of value
an old electric razor is too bulky for joes pocket probably worthless anyhow
townys array of medicines merely recalls joes purpose
mama a coincidence
guess who was being discussed
do you have that thing turned up
why arent you wearing it
this is impossible
joe lifts ratso from the taxi and carries him inside
listen towny did i mention i got a sick kid
joe is rehearsing the speech in the bathroom mirror
well he is hes sickern shee it
and ive gotta get him south quick as i can
joe stands in a long line glancing impatiently at the clock while ratso waits on a bench wrapped in his blanket
towny is stretched out on the couch staring morosely
i was so childish with her
joe moves into frame past camera standing in front of him so that we can see the scene from behind joes waist
what dyou want
what you got me up here for
oh difficult its so difficult
youre a nice person joe i should never have asked you up a lovely person
oh how i loathe life
i loathe it
you want me to leave
no i mean yes please go
help me to be good
come back tomorrow
im going to florida
this is terrible
i meet someone who then wait i want to give you a present
for your trip
youll let me please
joes face is expectant next in line at the ticket window
he nods reassuringly toward ratso
joes face is puzzled then angry as towny takes a saint christopher medal from his sack and hands it to joe
his eyes are looking past joe his speech out of sync
please take it
you dont have to be catholic
saint christopher is the patron saint of all travelers
i want you to have it
for helping me be good
its joes turn
the clerk looks at him expectantly
joes voice is angry
listen i gotta have money
i should have thought
you shouldnt have to ask
that was thoughtless of me
towny hurries across the room to the bedside table
beside the telephone is a picture of a prosperous pioneer woman wearing a hearing aid
towny tries to conceal his movements as he takes a wallet from the drawer lifts out a bill and tucks the wallet back and turns terrified to see joe close
behind him almost knocking the lamp off the table in his fright
pressed against the table protecting but calling attention to his wallet towny holds out the bill
dont even thank me
takes the bill i gotta have moren ten
i gotta have fifty seven dollars
i simply dont have it joe
get outta my way
youre wasting your time
theres nothing in there
towny clutches the table staring at joe shaking his head like a bad little boy
joe backhands him angrily
trying to duck the blow towny stumbles and slips to the floor but grabs the table in his arms watching joe out of the corner of his eyes whimpering
joe grabs his hair turning his face up
let go of the table
joe slaps him but towny clings more fiercely to the table as joe tries to jerk it free
joe strikes him with his fist
i deserved that i know i did
but he clutches the table wildly
his mothers picture falls unnoticed
joe stands in panic sickened unable to fulfill the role towny has assigned him
i brought this on myself
im bleeding my nose is bleeding isnt it
townys eyes shine teeth clenched in a crazy smile blood trickling from his nose
suddenly joe jerks the lamp free of its socket
you wanna gimme fifty seven dollars or you wanna busted skull
towny simply stares at the lamp
please let go of that table
joe threatens swings the lamp down but stops short of hitting towny
towny shrieks eyes rolling back as he falls limp loosing his grip on the table leaning on the bed laughing and crying hysterically
joe has to step over him to reach the wallet in the drawer
he takes all the money probably twice what he needs desperate to get out of the room
joe carries ratso up the steps onto the bus
townys shrill little whisper says
thank you joe
provoking joe to glance back
towny is reaching for the telephone his eyes on joe with wild brightness holding his hand on the receiver
joe knocks the phone from his hand hits towny in the mouth jerks the cord from the wall as towny falls gagging finally dislodging his dentures on the carpet
joe stands sick and confused holding the useless phone in two hands
the bus driver revs the powerful engine shifting gears
joe is about to hang the dead receiver on its hook when on sudden impulse he shoves the small end of the receiver into the toothless mouth of the man
on the floor
the bus roars into the tunnel
joe and ratso sit near the rear of the bus
ratsos teeth chatter wrapped in the blanket
thirty one hours
they ride a few moments in silence
the trip is
nine thirty in the morning we get there
not this morning but the next one at nine thirty
both nod for a moment in silence
these guysre good drivers
they gotta be
the bus tires sing as it speeds south
joe and ratso have reversed places putting ratso by the window
joe watches a middle aged couple try on their new straw hats unaware that joe is watching them
you get your first palm tree in south carolina
hown hell a dumb bronx kid like you know that
i read it
you believe all you read
the metal grating rings as the bus soars onto it
two aging young ladies in brand new resort wear are casually examining joe along with the other men on the bus but joe is frowning at ratso who shivers despite
the bright sun
if you have to shiver why dont you pull the blanket up more
i been thinking
i hope were not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there
because like whats the whole point of this trip anyway
keep the goddam blanket on
i mean new yorks one thing but can you see this guy imagine it running around the goddam beach all suntan and hes going in swimming like and then somebody
yells hey ratso how does that sound to you
sounds like they knew you
sounds like crap admit it
and im not gonna have it
im rico all the time okay do you blame me
thats agreed okay
were gonna tell all these new people my names rico
ratso closes his eyes momentarily at peace
the bus passes a florida hotel sign too swiftly to read it
joe frowns in his sleep awakens lifts his stetson to see ratso wide awake in misery wiping tears from his eyes
hey whatsa matter
barely audible im wet
i wet my pants
my seats all wet
hell dont cry about it
here i am going to florida and my leg hurts my butt hurts my chest hurts my face hurts and like that aint enough i gotta pee all over myself
joe laughs suddenly uncontrollably
im falling apart thats funny
nods laughing you just just what happened you just had a little rest stop wasnt on the schedule
ratso begins to laugh with joe as if it were the funniest thing theyd ever heard
then ratsos face pales as he starts to choke and cough
joe pats him on the back
hey what size pants you wear
the bus is parked in the distance
joe comes from a clothing store bare headed wearing plain slacks and sport shirt
he carries the boots stetson and cowboy suit in one hand a bundle under his arm
he dumps his cowboy regalia in the trash bin of a sandwich stand and calls to the waitress
couple crullersn coffee to go
the waitress draws coffee wraps crullers
where you from
she smiles gives him change
joe smiles starts on toward the bus hardly aware that he has accomplished something rare and remarkable for joe a simple human contact without fear or threat a pleasant everyday
joe and ratso have moved to the seat farthest back wider than the others
joe blocks the view of the other passengers as he helps ratso into a new pair of corduroy pants and a florida shirt
in the middle of the operation ratso dozes off
joe shakes his head scowling annoyed but continues lifting ratso enough to slide the pants around his waist
ratso awakens as joe zips the fly
hey what the hell you doing
im zipping your fly what the hell you think im doing
they both smile
it isnt funny enough to laugh at
joe arranges the blanket takes out a package of cigarettes glances at ratso and puts it away
palm trees are streaking past the window
the sun is glaring hot
a group of kids in bare feet and straw hats wave to the bus as it passes
ratsos eyes squint in a dazed half sleep
joe leans across to pull down the shade
he hesitates a moment watching
past his reflection a group of young men on their way to work carrying lunch pails dressed exactly as joe is now dressed
then joe lowers the blind and seats himself
ratso nods slightly his voice practically inaudible
shee it you know i got this thing all figured out ratso
i mean rico

i gotta do that cause see i aint no kind of a hustler
i aint even any goddam good as a bum
im a nothing thats what i am
so reckon id better go to work and get me a goddam job
joe glances at ratso but there is no response
surreptitiously joe takes out a cigarette turns his face away from ratso and lights it hiding it cupped in his hand as he smokes
yeah guess thats what im gonna do
they ride for a moment in semi darkness joe smoking looking at the other people on the bus brighter without the shades down
joe turns checking the blanket around ratso noticing that ratso is sitting in a peculiarly stiff awkward position
joe leans over to straighten ratsos head blocking our view for a moment
then joe leans back frowning thoughtful
we still do not see ratsos face
joe rises slowly starting forward in the bus
passing an older couple a schoolgirl two ladies with straw hats a young man trying to read pausing when he reaches
the driver staring out at the sunshine parkway with the driver leaning over so he wont have to speak too loudly
my friends dead in the back seat
your friends what in the back seat
dead as a doornail
is this some kind of
he glances at joe then pulls off the road and stands up
okay folks everythings fine
nothing to worry about
the passengers crane their necks as joe follows the driver to the rear of the bus
the passengers at the rear are staring ahead trying not to see what is going on
the driver touches ratso straightens touches his hat but doesnt remove it
is he kin to you
joe nods no
dont you want to close his eyes
just reach over and close them
joe closes ratsos eyes
i guess well just drive on right
nothing else to do
not till miami
ill see to burying then
the driver moves to the front and turns to the passengers
just a little sickness folks nothing serious
well be in miami
looks at watch in forty minutes
joe sits stiffly very frightened as the bus starts on
then he glances at ratso frowning reaches out an arm and puts it around ratso settling back staring straight ahead
