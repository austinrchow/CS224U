noahs ark going round
disjointed calliope music as the wheel of fate and fortune goes around until we pull back to reveal jon archer rising winged pegasus
on the adjacent unicorn is his son matthew
clutching a balloon matty waves at his dad
a happy moment like so many certain to follow until we realize we are watching them through
wait until the child clears his aim archer is the target
they round the bend and disappear
loses his grip on the unicorn
archer reaches over and pulls him into his lap
they happily ride together
as the horses sweep back into view
now we see the sniper
castor troy is cool efficient aggressive sexual
his finger closes around the trigger
a bullet rips into archers back
he drops off his horse
and sinks to the deck of the carousel
his eyes desperately searching
until he sees matthew lies on his back still
slowly archer reaches out and takes matthews hand
and now we see color for the first time
as bleeding father touches bleeding son
tilt up to the winged pegasus flying by now in full color and up up up to matthews red balloon
handels messiah over a series of shots gazing out the window as dawn breaks over the city below is jon archer
his eyes reveal a man in the grip of obsession
sweeps by as if marking time itself
dominated by a gleaming golden cross
a priest kneels before it deep in prayer
the glimmering cross comes into focus
but its just a light reflection
off the casing of a large bomb
this is no chapel
but an atrium
and as the priest rubs out his cigarette we see its castor troy carefully installing this complex device
pockets his fbi badge then holsters his gun
sets the bomb timer then replaces a wall panel in front of it
is on a computer screen
his criminal dossier scrolls by endlessly bombings assassinations mercenary kidnappings terrorism for hire
rookie agent loomis studies the details carefully
other agents including buzz and wanda scan computer grid maps man phones etc
amid the take out cartons and coffee cups
these people are on high alert
any follow up from l
no sir nothing yet
get them on the phone now
what about s
and our airport teams
weve had everything from psychics to satellites on this
even if castor was here
he must have slipped the net by now
and were going to keep looking until we find him
a silence descends on the chastised team
as they go back to work veteran agent tito biondi takes archer aside
jon these people have been working round the clock you gotta cut them some slack
archer considers his best friends advice then
ill cut them some slack when i cut myself some slack
archer marches out slamming the door behind him
castor quietly shuts the security door behind him
an hispanic voice startles him
what are you doing
in perfect spanish thank goodness i feel like icarus in the labyrinth wheres the mens room
in spanish this area is off limits padre
re security door how did you get in that room
realizing the janitor is already too suspicious castor puts a priestly arm around him and leads him down the hall
i have a confession to make but you arent gonna like it
i was planting a bomb
you know boom patting his neck oh never mind
the janitor suddenly twitches his eyes rolls up in his head
as he gasps his last castor heaves him down a stairwell
now we see the needle thin custom stiletto in castors hand
castor kicks the janitors mop and bucket down the stairs making everything look like an accident
the childrens church choir strong sing behold the lamb of god
clergy and lay persons listen reverently
father castor strolls by the singers casually heading for the exit
as he passes the risers a teenage girl drops her sheet music at his feet
returning it he whispers in her ear so close hes practically licking it
ive never enjoyed the messiah
but your voice makes even a hack like handel seem like a genius
he pats her behind and leaves
although a little shaken shes also drawn by castors sexual magnetism
the marquee proclaims international church choirs th st american bar association
castor exits politely holding the door for a beat cop
the office is a monument to obsession photographs clues newsclips totems of castor troy surround a pacing archer
on phone i dont have time to get a warrant from some hung over judge
just give me the go ahead victor and i promise as soon as this is over you can brand my butt with the fourth amendment
the instant archer hangs up the intercom buzzes
sir your wifes on line one
tell her to hang on as archer punches up line two tito bursts in
a jet was chartered at anderson airfield
guess who just showed up to pay for it
scramble the reaction team were moving out
and get one of our people on that plane
but theres still no sign of castor
where one brother goes the others sure to follow
they rush our
the hold button on line still blinking
a sleek cadillac pulls in
stopping next to a land rover
lars mueller a muscular crystal eyed jar head gets out of the caddy
an instant later lunt mueller emerges from the rover
they are identical twins
the men scan the airport carefully then open the rear doors of their respective vehicles
castor emerges from the caddy armani clad
exiting the rover is castors younger brother pollux troy skittish brilliant paranoid a human hummingbird
youre minutes late
the casing didnt fit right
i knew that cheap shit dietrich would rip us off
i forgot to turn the damn thing on
youre kidding right
to the twins hes kidding
grabs castor by throat are you fucking kidding
castor hugs pollux lovingly
pollux squirms like a kid
bro everything went fine
i hate when you call me bro
pollux heads for the jet
castor hands lunt a wad of cash
thanks for babysitting
ill contact you when we get the rest of the money
turns to leave oh and stat away from downtown
the inversion layers going to be pretty thick around the th
the twins nod
then take off
castor heads for the jet
castor hustles in exhorting the pilot
lets go lets go
as the jet turbines start to whine castor sinks into his seat
a very sexy flight attendant appears and hands him a scotch
he downs it looking her over salaciously
would you like anything else
pulls her into lap its the only way to fly
she smiles not minding until the jet suddenly slows its taxi down the runway
castor yanks open the door
a squat car creeps into view blocking the runway
behind the wheel is jon archer
beside him is tito
gun to pilots head go dammit
suddenly the gun is blasted from castors hand
he turns around to see
the flight attendant behind them holding a smoking pistol
this is agent winters
throttle down captain
but castor elbows the throttle up
the jet lurches forward throwing winters off balance
pollux tackles her as the jet picks up speed
archer slams the vehicle into gear
youre not playing chicken with two tons of aluminum
tito obeys as archer peels out
the hummer roars at the jet
the jet picks up speed trying to get aloft
the humvee is aimed right at it
archers eyes narrow
as two hunks of metal bear down
the machines are seconds apart when archer looks up to see
winters face pressed up against the cockpit window castor holding a gun to her head
archer cuts the wheel just avoiding the jet
the hummer skids to a stop as federal back up arrives but too late
archer watches an fbi chopper landing in a swirl of dust
as the jet picks up speed
the hatch opens
castor blasts winters in the side and tosses her onto the tarmac
castor smiles at pollux sensing freedom until
ka chunk something pounds the jet from above
castor leans out the hatch and sees
the chopper on top of them archer at the controls
eye contact years of hatred pass between these men
castor blasts at him from the open hatch
the choppers left windscreen spiderwebs
archer jerks and weaves dodging the bullets
the chopper pulls away
the jet finally lifts off
the chopper settles on the jet slamming at its tail
tito reacts to this madness as the chopper plays a deadly game of leap frog with the jet
the end of the runway is coming up fast
archer crushes the jets horizontal elevator flap
cant budge the jets jammed yoke
thwarted he powers back the throttle
what are you doing
the horizontal elevators smashed
we cant lift off
shoots the pilot then takes the controls
he struggles to maneuver the jet
a biplane descends right at them about to land
pulls up just as the jet swerves radically to avoid the biplane and slams into the hangar
plows through the glass door the nose wheel snaps off
the plane skids right into the hangar finally stopping at the wings
archer steps out calmly like a cop about to write a traffic ticket
he hurries to join more fbi agents rushing into the hangar ahead of him
the jet hatch pops open castor leaps from it firing
two fbi agents drop riddled
pollux appears at the hatch an fbi sharpshooter fires grazing polluxs shoulder
staggered pollux falls castor catches him before he hits the floor simultaneously blasting the sharpshooter
castor drags pollux back into the smoke filled hangar
archer arrives and quickly checks the dead agents his anger building
he signals tito and the others to spread out
a maze of airplane debris and heavy machinery
led by archer the fbi agents pick their way through it
rookie loomis snaps alert did he see something
advancing carefully he comes up on
castor staunching polluxs shoulder wound
pollux sees the agent and fires
loomis hits the floor his bleeding ear is shredded
suddenly a forklift charges down on castor and pollux
tito is at the wheel
castor fires forcing tito to dive off
the forklift careens on driving apart the brothers
the forklift upends a stack of heavy crates pinning pollux
castor tries to free his trapped brother
forget it go
he slaps his glock into polluxs hand
wherever they put you ill find a way to get you out
pollux starts firing covering castor as he runs through a tunnel which leads to an adjoining hangar
suddenly wanda presses her machine pistol into polluxs head
as pollux raises his gun tito grabs his hand
not unless you want that i
splattered all over the floor
as archer approaches we got him now jon
thats what you always say
seal it off
im going in
archer moves away from the group and enters the tunnel
music as archer and castor begin their cat and mouse dance
sensing archer castor pauses by an old landing gear
he draws a fresh pistol from his ankle holster and moves on
archer pauses at the landing gear
his own stealthy movements mirroring castors
castor waits behind a stack of steel drums
his gaze trying to penetrate the darkness
he snaps his fingers
the sound echoes as he tries to draw archer in
archer reacts to the sound and snaps back answering the challenge
as the deadly beat between them continues blam blam blam
archer spins away just as castor opens fire from the gloom
one step ahead
intercut as necessary jon im getting a little annoyed by your obsessive need to spoil my fun
and how much will your fun net you this time
boom boom boom
half blind shots send castor spinning
a moment later archer pursues
he fits a new clip into his pistol
whats it to you
i declare it
here i am back in the states for less than a week youre under arrest
incredibly you still have the right to remain silent ive got something going down on the eighteenth
its gonna be worse than anything god ever dumped on the pharaoh
ill give it up but my brother and i have to walk
no discussion no deals
whatre you gonna do with me locked up
youll drive your wife and kid nuts
i bet your daughter is just about ripe by now
whats her name janie
enraged archer steps boldly forward trying to draw his enemy out
silence then archer senses
castor is behind him
he fires archer dives away
the barrage continues driving archer back between two huge turbine engines
as archer reloads he stares at the control panel switches
castor moves in for the kill when he hears a final snap snap
except it isnt a finger snap
its two switches
the twin engines roar on
unable to fight the churning tornado force wind
castors blasted across the hangar
slamming hard into the far wall
the engines stop and archer emerges joined by tito
tell me he didnt get away again
then tito follows archers gaze to castors lifeless body
still as death somehow his mocking smile survives
heavily manacled an extremely agitated pollux is herded into a swat van by buzz and wanda
wheres my brother
i want to see my brother
the van takes off passing an imposing older man flanked by two bodyguards
bullying through the media assistant fbi director victor lazarro scans the devastation
approaching archer he watches as castors body is loaded on the ambulance
a sheet covers castors lifeless face
the oversight committee wouldve roasted us for this one thank god it paid off
damn fine work
real fine victor
especially the casualties
archer contemplates the slain agents their three bodies laid out in a row waiting to be zip locked
lazarro reacts grimly as a reporter snaps a photo of the bodies
instinctively the two men close ranks
archer grabs the nikon ejects the film then shoves the camera back
lazarro puts a caring arm around archers shoulder and leads him away from the media
and the carnage
you okay jon
off archers nod then go home
a renovated craftsman
sipping a carton of milk archer pulls into the driveway
he sits gathering his thoughts
archer enters and sees his wife eve
no response whats wrong
she nods toward the kitchen
jamie is there a sullen and hard fifteen year old
there are cigarette cartons on the table
she complimented for her f in history with an a in shoplifting
archer marches into the kitchen noting the crate of marlboros
jamie matter of factly pours herself coffee
nice stunt jamie
you break the law and im expected to ignore it
thats right its all about you
dont even ask me what happened
archer looks to eve for help
eve shakes her head nope
like youd ever fucking believe me
in anticipation eve calmly opens the door as jamie rushes out then closes it behind her
well you tried
you failed miserably but you tried
why wont she even talk to me
maybe because you taught her never to speak to strangers
immediately regrets it im sorry
that wasnt fair
eve kisses his cheek then gathers up her doctor gear
ive got patients waiting
try again jon
she hates you but she needs you
something in archers expression makes her stop
jon what is it
but hes too overcome
he starts to speak but cant
is it him
emotions avalanche across his face until he finally looks up
eve pulls him close a sheltering embrace for them both
im going to make everything up to you and jamie
ill put in for a desk job
well go away get counseling anything you want
this time i mean it
freshly dressed archer heads down the hall
he pauses at the door to jamies room when he sees jamie
fully clothed shes fast asleep on her bed cluttered with clothes and assorted girl stuff
her face peaceful
archer looks around her room
sees the stuffed animals collecting dust
replaced by makeup jewelry beefcake calvin klein ads and band posters etc
archers startled to see a lacey bustier
his little girl is growing up fast
and hes missing it
he pulls the blanket up over her and quietly slips out
the instant he leaves jamie kicks the blankets off
dominated by the fbi seal
archer steps to the check point
archer presses his thumb to a scan pad and is cleared
efficient as a beehive agents cryptologists support staff buzz at their routines
archer strides through drawing congratulatory nods and thumbs up signs
archers team is there
uneasy with plaudits he disperses the disappointed agents
now lets get back to work okay
to buzz is that stick ever gonna fall out of his ass
archers well built secretary kim brewster hands him his messages
shes holding a bottle of dom perignon
sent this over
what should i do with it
send it back and tell them to stop wasting the taxpayers money
anything else miss brewster
he enters his office
kimberly sighs and turns to wanda
four years and he still calls me miss brewster
sitting at his computer archer scrolls through castors file
he grimly contemplates face after face of troys victims finally pausing on a photo of his son matthew
burying his feeling he types case closed over castors image
archer starts to press enter when tito comes in
he needs some surgery but hes going to be okay
thats the good news
brodie and miller from special ops need to see you
i dont have time for those cloak and dagger guys
big ned brodie and athletic female hollis miller stroll in
you better make time jon
hefts a disc we found this in the jet wreckage among pollux troys effects
archer accedes as miller pops in the disk
the computer screen displays a cad schematic of the bomb
archer studies it carefully unease growing
powerful enough to flatten ten city blocks
worse than anything god ever dumped on the pharaohs
to tito get pollux troy
wired to a complex machine pollux seems to have his frustrated interrogators on the run
archer lazarro tito brodie miller and other fbi officials watch the monitor
pollux remains implacable on screen that bomb was just a crossword puzzle to me
a mental exercise
i never built it
lazarro shuts down the monitor
turns to archer
hes hooked up to a full spectrum polygraph
pollux is a manipulative psychopath
he can control his heartbeat his sweat glands his blood pressure
jon i trust your instincts i always have
wants more evidence
and frankly so do i
youll get all the evidence you need when ten thousand people die
well get a team right on it
but we cant evacuate the city on what amounts to a hunch
archer looks at the gathered brass
he knows its hopeless
that bomb has been built its out there somewhere and its going to detonate
words etched in the granite wall read archer watches as a workman engraves the last of the three new stars among so many others each one honoring the dead
didnt castor give any clue where the bomb might be
only one person knows his brother pollux
and hell keep his mouth shut until it blows
we could plant an agent in his cell get him to spill the location
pollux is way too paranoid
the only person hed talk to about that bomb is castor himself
and dead men cant talk
brodie and miller exchange a knowing look
there might be a way around that
tubes and hoses are plugged into every orifice
archer stares at the body
he cant believe it
why are you keeping him alive
gets no answer as long as hes breathing hes dangerous
relax hes a turnip
miller grinds out her cigarette on castors leg
of course castor just lies there like a vegetable
we can arrange for you to enter erewhon prison as castor troy
what are you talking about
archer turns as dr
malcolm hoag s enters the room
i think id better answer that question
offers hand malcolm hoag
i run the physiological camouflage unit for special ops
i know who you are
but you dont know what he can do
physical augmentation enhancement surgery
he can disguise a compromised agent or alter the likeness even the voice of a government witness
let me show you how its done
leading him out i think youll recognize our patient
loomis lies still as a surgeon carefully scrapes away charred flesh around his burned ear
the doctor turns to a laser beams attack an organic soup with incredible precision
the light forces a chemical reaction and out of the soup an ear begins to form
it rises from the liquid now fully formed
the surgeon takes the ear and fits it in place on loomiss head
he starts suturing
archer hoag brodie and miller watch the operation video enhanced by the two huge screens on the far walls
with our new generation of anti inflammatories healing is accelerated from weeks to days
by his next paycheck he wont even remember which ear he lost
a beat your situation however would be a little less permanent
and a lot more classified
hoag holds up a face sized organic shell made up of yellow cartilage pieces and tendons etc
archer pulls it over his face like a gauze mask
a tendon falls off
thisll fool pollux
that is a state of the art morpho genetic template
the inside can be built to match the exact shape of your skull the outside exactly like castors
then we fit his face right on top and you become him
youre talking about removing the guys face
the procedures completely reversible
one way or the other the mission ends on the eighteenth
archer turns the shell over and over and over in his hands
you know castor better than anyone
youve lived and breathed him for years hell you even look a little like him
archer shoves the template back at hoag
find yourself another lab rat
if you dont do this castor will beat us again
hell beat you again
archer pushes his way past them and marches out
i dont think that went very well
trust us doc
hell jerk around
then hell be back
sizes up dietrich hassler
his stylish garb doesnt completely hide his criminal roots
archer sits down calmly
he looks at his watch
im in a hurry dietrich
so youve only got ten seconds to go through your usual litany of lies empty threats and moronic denials
then im coming over there if youre in such a fucking hurry why are you wasting your time with me
im just an art dealer
youre a dealer all right technical secrets munitions
youve never proven any of that
and when my bitchy never been laid femi nazi lawyer gets here shes going to
archer topples the wooden table and tears a leg from the top
brandishing it he stalks the startled thug
lazarro blanches as an obsessed archer repeatedly slams the table leg against the wall above dietrichs head
the only ticking bomb i see is inside his head
hes getting worse tito
dont worry sir
its all an act
but as lazarro leaves we see titos worried too
archer has a terrified dietrich backed into the corner
castor called me but i blew him off
i swear i never saw him
and i dont know anything about any bomb
let him go but i want him watched
just dietrichs sister
in another booth a careworn but striking woman sits with a little boy on her lap
she gently helps him crayola a book
this is sasha hassler and her son adam
archer hovers over sasha her maternal warmth replaced by an icy hatred
tito and the child are gone
when was the last time you saw castor troy
answer the question
look im clean
i teach kids now sasha you are a felon on probation for harboring castor troy
so its in your best interest to cooperate
as shes silent would you like your son put in a foster home
sashas eyes flash her body coils but she keeps control
no but im sure youd love it you sick bastard
unmoved when was the last time you saw castor troy
she stares at him with equal amounts of pity and hatred
i havent seen him for years
archer watches as adam leaves dietrich and jumps into sashas arms
she hugs him protectively
adam sees archer watching them and smiles
archer doesnt smile back
archer slowly circles castors muscular hairy tattooed body
although on life support his signature smirk remains
what about lazarro
no way the red tape alone would take a month
this is a black bag operation completely off the books
if you need him tito can help you prepare
but you know the drill you cant tell anyone not the director not your wife
archers face shows he doesnt like it then he nods
archer slowly gets out of his car
trudging toward the front door he picks up a basketball and takes a shot
his form is terrible he misses by a mile
archer passes jamies room
loud music pounds from within
he pauses to knock thinks again then heads down the hall
eve is in bed
archer comes in quietly and sits beside her studying her peaceful sleeping face
i was dreaming
im not sure
you were flying this weird old stunt plane
walking on the wings
i was watching from the ground when you fell
you had a parachute but you wouldnt open it
did you catch me
i dont know
nuzzles him maybe because youve never needed my help
come on you made that up didnt you
maybe i did
teasing maybe i didnt
they kiss affectionately
passion building eve runs her hands over his body until her fingers touch a round scar on his chest
archer freezes mid caress
its all right jon
after all these years i still cant get it out of my head an inch to the left matty would still be alive
and you wouldnt be
the pain hidden in his silence chills eve
things will get better now that youre home
everything will be better now that
that man is finally out of our lives
he starts to say the words
he wants needs to share the truth with her
but he cant
instead if i had to do something to find some closure
i should do it shouldnt i
no matter how crazy
oh god youre going on assignment again
one last time
and while im gone i want you and jamie to go to your mothers
you said youd be here
what could be more important than that
i cant tell you
except only i can do it
you want me to tell you its okay to leave
okay go on
fury erupting eve pushes archer out of the bed
archer enters a childs room neat and tidy like a museum exhibit
a starfield of glow letters twinkles faintly
he lies down on the bed and toys with his wedding band staring up at the words the stars form
the blinking led of the bomb timer continues to count down
tito drives into the hoag compound
archers beside him juggling castors dossier documents photos etc
jon this is goddam insane
you cant do it
archer says nothing
its too late for debate
the men get out and head for the lab
you havent got a chance in hell of fooling pollux
castor drinks smokes and walks around with a hour hard on
hes nothing like you dont worry
if hoag can do half what he claims ill get pollux to talk
archer reaches for the door tito stops him
its not that simple jon
becoming another person especially him nobody can come all the way back from that
not even you
archer considers his friends words
he toys with then removes his wedding bang
keep this for me
as tito takes the ring a caring but concerned look passes between the two friends
two huge video screens are dominated by the cg images of archer and castor
as hoag briefs the team the cg images glow to reflect the physical characteristic hoag refers to
lets walk through it jon
your blood types are different but we cant do anything about that
otherwise nature is cooperating nicely
the height difference is negligible within an inch
eye color almost a perfect match
penis size flaccid essentially the same substantial
from the observation booth above miller flanked by tito and brodie raises his eyebrow
on the video screens the images morph to signify the physical augmentations
hairline will be adjusted with laser shears
micro plugs for the body hair
the teeth will be bonded to match castors
hoag eyes castors inert tight body then turns to archer prodding his love handles like a livestock inspector
how about an abdominoplasty
a tummy tuck
on the house
intercut huge video screen enlargements of archer and castors body parts as necessary globules of adipose tissue are siphoned off archers obliques
at the same time
hoag recreates the great sphinx tattoo on archers thigh
we push in on his leg then pull back to reveal
archer and tito
the close up on his leg becomes a full shot as he walks across the rooftop like himself
tito demonstrated the proper castor gait dangerously casual like a panther
hoag reproduces castors fingerprints
then layers them over archers fingers
archer practices castors icy killer glare
tito hands him a lit cigarette
archer brings the cigarette to his lips then coughs harshly
but he keeps trying
then smirks and laughs
pull back to reveal archer studying surveillance footage of castor on a monitor screen mimicking him
archer fusses with his new hair trying to cover the thin spots
giving up he zips up his sweatshirt getting the zipper caught in his new chest hair
tito tosses a pistol
archer catches it with his right hand
but to archers surprise tito frowns
but you used the wrong hand
he takes the pistol away and slaps it in archers left hand
then tito shoves him challengingly
as archer doesnt move shoot me
tito pulls the gun against his own forehead
you want to be castor troy
if you hesitate for a breath youre finished
now shoot me
archer holds the gun unsteadily
tito is disgusted
you cant do it
because castor is tougher than you
the gun goes off the slug tears past titos head
shocked he touches his left ear making sure its still there
then tito looks at archer and sees the determination
clear and calm
someones god anyway
hoag leads archer to a full length mirror
lets see if i missed anything before i get my hands really dirty
archer removes the robe
hes amazed to see his own head on castors body a flat stomach hairy chest tattoos thinning hair etc
hoag touches archers scar
you realize this has to be removed
as archer slowly nods then here we go commander
through the looking glass
unconscious archer is wheeled into the surgical bay castor beside him
hoag turns to the video technician
make sure you get everything ill need to study the tape before the reverse surgery
hoag lowers an aerated plexiglas mask over archers face
interwoven with integrated laser circuitry this derma induction device d
attaches via suction
hoag sights through the optical memory squeezes the trigger
a cobalt beam cuts around the face cleanly slicing it
then hoag lifts archers face off of his skull
brodie and miller watch from above
tito stumbles into the nearby bathroom to throw up
hoag inspects archers face then turns to his nurse
hoag turns to perform the same procedure on castor
castors consistent eeg reading suddenly spikes radically for a moment it almost seems to stabilize
hoag glances over too late the spikes have disappeared
but the camera closes in on castors ear and we sense that somehow his auditory nerves might be functioning
a head swathed in gauze
the bandages start to fall away
tito miller and brodie wait as hoag removes the gauze
the patient looks into a mirror
jon archer has become castor troy
he touches his new face
the cold reality chilling his blood
archer buckles unprepared emotionally for what hes done to himself
for a moment he seems to teeter on madness
jon are you all right
archer cant respond
hes somewhere the others cant comprehend
finally he emerges
shaken but in control
instinctively he grabs for his holster
realizes but my voice
i still sound like me
i implanted a micro chip onto your larynx
hoag switches on an audio tape
archer repeats castors words as hoag adjusts the chip with a wavelength box
okay ive got a okay ive got a confession to make but confession to make but you arent gonna like you arent gonna like it
after a few repetitions archers voice matches perfectly
archer yawns squints and furrows his brow testing every muscle
he stares into the mirror into the eyes of his most hated enemy now his eyes
archer slowly turns to
motionless swathed dead to the world but something about castors smile that mocking smile
were down to hours
lets call lazarro
castor troy just came out of his coma
armed agents take their positions around a helipad
a jet black helicopter drops from the sky like an angry wasp
as lazarro watches tito escorts out a heavily manacled castor
two armed agents leap from the chopper and take charge of castor
he follows them pliantly until watch this hard case hell bite your nuts off if he gets the chance
archer gets the message
he starts to resist the agents and must be muscled into the chopper
hes manacled down
eye contact between archer and tito both aware of this very real point of departure
the chopper door slams shut
it lifts off like a twister and screams away
the watching team breaks up wanders back to work
what a week for archer to go on a training op
maybe we should try to contact him
hes knee deep in georgia swamp by now
they pass brodie and miller who watch the chopper disappear over the horizon
so far so good
the agent re checks archers chains
dont forget i ordered a kosher meal
the agent smashes his elbow into archers gut
the second agent presses an injector against archers leg
archer spasms against the drug then sags unconscious
archer wakes up as a torrent of delousing spray hits him
a guard holds a water cannon on the newest inmate
archer lies gasping on the steel floor protecting his face
the spray stops when head guard red walton enters
you are now an erewhon inmate a citizen of nowhere
human rights zealots the geneva convention and the p
police have no authority here
you have no right
slaps on latex gloves when i say your ass belongs to me i mean it
archers face reflects the degradation as he bends over and exposes all to the cavity searching guard
satisfied walton lets archer dress
another guard places a pair of odd looking steel boots before archer
step into them
archer inspects the lock down boots
hinged steel collars hook over the shoe and encase the ankle
the soles are gridded steel with magnetic inserts
dont sniff em you perv
just step into them
a guard squats down and locks the steel collars over archers shoes
he tries to move but cant
theyre too tight
sos a noose
now keep your mouth shut
walton jolts archer with his high voltage shock stick
the prisons one big magnetic field
the bootsll tell us where you are every second of the day
into comm link to population
walton presses his thumb into a standard fbi scan pad
it forms a print positively identifying the guard
the heavy blast door automatically opens
ive got fifty bucks says youre dead by dinner
dont disappoint me
walton prods archer toward the door
to archers surprise he can now move
the inmates eat
silence descends as archer enters intensifying the constant humming of the magnetic field
huge dubov does a slow burn on seeing castor
scanning the room for pollux archer takes a seat next to a little goateed man with a french accent
hey castor remember me
sure i catches himself i believe jon archer busted you for poisoning five members of the the canadian parliament
those scumbags should never have voted against the quebecois
a beat we heard you got wasted
archer sees the other inmates sizing him up
do i look wasted asshole
voisine shakes his head no then his eyes widen as
dubov leaps onto archer and starts pummeling him
they slide across the table spilling everyones lunch
into comm unit central
i have a disturbance in population
go to lock down into comm unit hold that lock down
walton watches as dubov throws archer across the room
archer staggers to his feet and sees the encircling inmates and guards looking at him unimpressed
especially his brother pollux who watches uncertainly
dubov attacks again but archer is ready
he grabs dubovs fist just before it hits his face
never in the face
holding dubovs fist firmly archer kicks dubov repeatedly in the groin
metal boot meeting soft flesh
dubov staggers back hurt
archer moves in for the kill savoring it
walton looks skyward
lock em down
the prisons nerve center with video feeds and monitors designed to keep problems and privacy to a minimum
the two deputies react to waltons call
identifying archer and dubovs signature blips they throw the appropriate switches and
the magnetic boots lock both inmates to the floor
dubov flails hopelessly but archers just out of reach
walton punches archer in the diaphragm
he started it
walton smashes archer harder he hits the floor
when i get out of here youll what
im going to have you fired
his statement is so ludicrous walton laughs
from the inmates reactions archer knows hes been accepted
to dubov thats two strikes dubov
one more and you know where youre going
to the others back to your suites or no dinner
as archer drops into the line of cons he spots pollux waiting for him
girding himself for this first encounter hes got a plan
of course its pollux what the fucks wrong with you
archer stares feigning confusion until walton prods him forward
pollux watches his brother go very concerned
archer lies on his cot staring at the ceiling
isolated lonely he realizes how easy it would be to go insane here
an insanely starry night
van goghs night
the night he cut off his ear anyway
castors body lies inert
his life support machines blipping away
until the eeg spikes
once twice three times
brain wave activity increases and stabilizes
castors fingers twitch
then his fist clenches hard
castors head is swathed in gauze
but his eyes pop open
reflexively castor wrenches from the bed tearing out the tubes and wires that tether him to life support
he goes down in agony groaning
he struggles to his feet staggering through the lab until he catches the reflection of his bandaged face in the window
he quickly unwraps the gauze
the discarded bandages fall at his feet
we dont see what castor sees but we hear him moan
then scream the only moment castor ever loses his cool
finally composing himself castors hand grips the phone and he dials
okay lunt then
rifling desk documents something really fucked up happened
im in trouble
so listen very carefully
a range rover screeches up
at gunpoint lars and lunt manhandle hoag into the lab
lars and lunt hustle hoag in
the lab is on
the screens run scrolling through the video log of archers surgery
hoag sees his terrified assistants bound with duct tape
whats this about
what do you want
lars shoves hoag into a towering figure
we zoom in on hoags glasses
and through the reflection we see
hoag reacts in horror at the raw muscle cartilage and bone
the man lifts a cigarette to his lips
what do you think i want
a huge wall screen plays gentle nature scenes
below the inmates engage in their exercise hour
voisine stares at the screen while pollux carefully watches his brother play basketball
archer tosses up an air ball to the jeers of other inmates
you realize of course that magnetic humming is designed to drive us insane
if we all dont get brain tumors first
and that same cloying bambi tape over and over
its like theyre begging us to riot
where the fuck are we anyway
the game ends gotta go
pollux trots over to archer passes him his cigarette
he studies archer as he takes a drag and nearly gags
im worried about you
your jumpshot has no arc
you used to swagger
now you swish
youre gumming that butt like a catholic school girl
notices and why do you keep picking at your finger
pollux has caught archer reflexively tugging at his phantom wedding ring
archer immediately stops
he takes a drag and holds it then exhales right in polluxs face
i was in a coma
pollux sticks his finger under archers eye and pulls down like a vet examining a sick dog
archer pushes him off
my reflexes my senses my memory
i cant even tell you why dubov jumped me yesterday
you pollinated his wife the day he was arrested
how could forget that
ive forgotten plenty
look around weve screwed over half the freaks in here
whats gonna happen to us if they think ive lost it
pollux contemplates the other inmates circling sizing up the brothers like hungry sharks
instinctively pollux moves closer to archer for protection
i need you to play big brother for once till i can fill in a few blanks
think you can handle that
pollux nods grimly then archer pulls up his sleeve exposing the pyramid tattoo
i know i got this on my tenth birthday
i just cant remember why
man that was the worst day of our lives
archer feigns a struggle with his memory
he lights a new butt with the old chain style
oh god mom o dd at county general
retching and convulsing while those bastards didnt even try to save her sorry ass
you gave her mouth to mouth man even then you had some constitution
a beat remember what you swore to me at the funeral
uh to kill the doctors
you promised youd always take care of me
and i bet i kept that promise
only one youve never broken
pollux curls into archer in need of comfort
archer puts an affectionate arm around pollux springing the trap
screw the past
weve got the future to look forward to
a beat we still have tomorrow
five million bucks
now those red militia crackpots get to keep it
thats not the worst part
whats worse than losing five million bucks
being stuck in this rat hole when it blows
what you built was a work of art
it belongs in the smithsonian
pollux beams with pride archer hangs on every word
convention center will have to do
i guess they really did fuck you up
then archer smiles like jon archer
without knowing exactly why a wave of ill ease overtakes pollux
archer paces impatiently
as the door rolls open
walton is looking at him with cool respect
you have a visitor
archer smiles to himself pleased at brodies timeliness
archers boots lock down as the guillotine door rises
but his confidence evaporates into unspeakable horror
because he finds himself staring into the blue eyes of jon archer
this man has archers face his real face
whats the matter
dont you like the new me
archer studies the image of his former self trying to understand
then he recognizes the smirk on the face the mocking twinkle in the eyes and he says what he cannot say
it cant be
i believe the phrase dr
hoag used was titanically remote
maybe the trauma of having my face cut off pulled me out
or maybe god really is on my side after all
starts pacing by the way i know you dont get the papers in here
continuing to circle he displays the current la times inferno at hoag institute malcolm hoag dead terrible tragedy
hoag was such a genius but selfish with his artistry
i actually had to torture his assistants to convince him to perform the same surgery on me
you killed them
of course i killed them you dumb fuck
hoag his staff
flash on hoags body on the floor of the burning lab
two more burned bodies adjoin hoags
miller and brodie flash on brodie and miller dead in a mangled car wreck
i even paid a visit to your buddy tito
he doesnt know anything about this
come on jon
i think i know you better than that
i only wish you could have been there to see the look on his face flash on tito
he smiles then recoils in shock as castor lifts a pistol and shoots him
then he picks up archers wedding band off the counter
archer stares thunderstruck at the wedding band now on castors finger
then again i guess you were there
a beat i torched every shred of evidence that proves who you are
so swallow this you are going to be in here for the rest of your life
castor dont do this no discussion jon no deals
now if youll excuse me ive got an important government job to abuse and a beautiful wife to fuck
excuse me i mean make love to
archer freaks out
he screams flails unable to reach castor
castor opens the door and guards rush in clubbing archer and shocking him senseless
its quite all right
you never know what to expect from a psychopathic criminal
the guards dump archer into his cell
better be nice castor
you could get mighty lonely now that pollux is gone
pollux is what
archer cut him a deal for turning states evidence
hes been released
walton you have to listen to me right now
youll have me fired
pushes a button youre confined until i say otherwise
the steel panels shut silencing archers pleading voice
sipping a beer castor cruises past the suburban bliss men on hammocks women chatting kids playing tag
sickened jesus what a life
castor tries to catch a street address and rolls past
dressed for work eve watches blandly as the car goes by
a moment later it backs up and parks
hiding the beer can castor forces a sheepish smile and gets out
she doesnt smile back
i suppose it was only a matter of time before you forgot where we lived
sorry the jobs been murder lately
castor looks her over shes much sexier than he expected
so what happened to your important assignment
what do you know about it
i know exactly what you always tell me absolutely nothing
it didnt work out the way everyone thought it would
where are you off to
ive got surgery
surgery are you okay
then he spots her medical bag
dont try to charm me im still angry
therere leftovers in the fridge
have fun at work
castor kisses her good bye on the mouth
what is with you
dont i usually kiss my wife
castor reacts as she gets in the car and pulls out
castor steps inside looks around
what a dump
castor sifts through christmas cards from holidays past studying the ones with photos
hes memorizing matching names to faces wandas buzzs lazarros etc
something else catches his eye
he finds a floral notebook eves diary and pages through it
then he reads
date night has been a typical failure
we havent made love in almost two months
what a loser
castor hears a voice
glancing across the hall he sees
as she walks back and forth in her room talking on the phone and wearing only panties and a cropped t shirt
castor steps closer enjoying the view
the plot thickens
jamie stamps out her cigarette
i got your e mail karl
that poem was really sweet spots castor at door hang on a sec
she slams it but he gets his foot inside
ill call you back
to castor youre not respecting my boundaries
im coming in janie
castor pushes menacingly into the room
castor spots her correct name embroidered on a pillow
he gazes seductively unnerving jamie as he steps toward her
i dont think you heard me
you have something i want
he reaches for her and right past her
he picks up a pack of cigarettes from the desk
clarissa left those here
shrugs and lights up i wont tell mom if you dont
when did you start smoking
youll be seeing a lot of changes around here blows a perfect smoke ring daddys a new man
jamie stares astonished as castor goes out
fists bloody voice hoarse archer pounds at the cell door
exhausted he finally stops staring at the face of his enemy in the mirrored door the enemy who now has total command of his life
castor dons his stern archer face as the gate guard checks his thumbprint id
hes cleared and waved in
buzz and wanda watch pollux through the two way mirror
hes gorging himself on a big lunch
we just want you to know
were all really sorry about tito
yeah well shit happens
buzz and wanda exchange a glance
to them archer is just avoiding his feelings again
hows our star witness
he hasnt told us a damn thing except what kind of mustard he likes on his tongue sandwiches
if that bomb is out there were almost out of time
lazarro stomps toward them
buzz and wanda quickly excuse themselves
you made a deal with pollux troy
hes a manipulative psychopath
your own words jon
just let me do my job victor
the job ive been protecting for the last eight years
from now on you go strictly by the book
everything gets cleared by me
lazarro stomps off
castor watches him go wheels turning
castor enters shutting down the mikes
and the blinds
youre supposed to be snitching making me look good
drops food in disgust seeing that face i want to vomit
im the one who has to look at this butt ugly mug every time i pass a mirror
look at my eyes my chin my perfect nose gone
considers his reflection archer took my life so im taking his
bro im going straight
sounds like they took your brain too
imagine dillinger as j
carlos the jackal running interpol
kaddafi heading the mossad
think of the secrets we could sell
pollux listens carefully mind clicking like an abacus
the drug agents we could expose
the movie stars we could blackmail
thats just the bottom of the food chain
pollux what would happen if somebody planted a bomb on air force one
that somebody would get rich
and i suppose the nation would be pretty pissed off
pissed off vulnerable
looking for someone to step in take charge give them hope again
what if that someone was an f
a true boy scout and family man with a spotless past
imagine where that guy could land if the timings right
its an audacious dream caz
but jon archer is hardly a household name
not yet he isnt
but after you confess youll be a free man
and ill be on my way
police vehicles roar into position
squads of police evacuate throngs of people
ticks down to less than two minutes
working as a unit the bomb squad carefully remove the bombs casing
inside the complex guts glow evilly
the men are tense cautious and way out of their league
run castor pushes up his blast visor
he looks grim
its protected by a vibration detector
one touch and
evacuate your team captain
sir you cant disarm it just go
the bomb squad hustles out
waiting until hes alone castor pulls a radio device from his pocket and hits its switch
the bombs glow dies instantly
stops at seconds
not satisfied castor starts it up again running the timer down to four seconds
the inmates eat lunch
walton enters prodding a beaten jon archer ahead of him
a special privilege today tv by order of agent jon archer of the f
jeers from the inmates as the big screen changes from the nature loop to
sweating castor lumbers out carrying the disarmed bomb
that was the scene at the l
convention center where an f
agent is being hailed as a hero
agent jon archer disarmed a powerful bomb just seconds before it was set to explode
lets get the latest from valerie rice
castor basks in the attention of the gathered media
the apparent target was a group of supreme court justices due to speak here today
thrusting microphone mr
archer do you have any idea who planted it
but if hes listening i have a message for him directly into camera nice try
now you know whos really in charge
watching the tv archers enraged frustrated
then his eyes focus
he watches closely as a guard uses his thumbprint id to get through the security door
archers eyes fall on the thumbprint scan pad
castor gets a thumbs up from some co workers others smile but they know better than to applaud
dont you guys watch tv
wheres the parade
they look at each other afraid
but proud rookie loomis starts clapping so everyone else joins in rousing applause
loomis buzz uh wanda
all of you thanks from the bottom of my heart
thanks for enduring all those years i was an insufferable boor
from now on consider me reborn
stop the presses jon archer found a personality
interrupted by an excited kim
the white house is calling
castor acts startled
as if at a loss
then he struts toward his office pausing only to give kim a playful swat on the rump
castor surveys his new domain
he settles into archers big leather chair
sees a framed photo of archer and family
he apes archers dumb posed smile
jon your career is finally taking of
picks up phone archer
sure ill hold
waiting he picks up a handbook you and the fbi a primer for new employees
president what an honor
castor pumps a whacking off gesture with his hand
castor carrying grocery bags comes into the back yard where jamie practices free throws
he watches her miss
how about a game of horse
dont make me beat your butt again dad
its harmful to my developing psyche
afraid youll lose
castor crisply sinks a free throw
jamie glares takes the ball and tosses an air ball
jamie sneers at him
he buries another one
try putting a higher arc on the ball
and square your shoulders to the basket
begrudgingly she listens and sinks a clean shot
pleased she nods
a bmw pulls into the driveway
jamie trots over to greet karl a clean cut preppie
opening the car door dor her karl waves smiling at castor
castor studies karl carefully not liking what he sees
a tired eve opens the door
its pitch black inside
as she fumbles for the light switch
flares as castor lights a candle
the dining room table is set for a candlelight dinner
he smiles warmly at her confusion
dont tell me you forgot
eve its date night
eve looks up from her pasta
after an awkward silence
why do i feel like im on a blind date
its important to keep some mystery
so things stay
eve studies him as he pours her more wine
her smile slowly fades as she realizes whats going on
youre about as unpredictable as the tide
detached how long are you going to be gone this time
isnt that what all this is about
the wine cooking me dinner your next assignment
im not going anywhere
you always say that then you leave
i bet i deserved that
i bet jon archer is the most inattentive sexless spouse on earth
jon thats not true of course its true but im trying to change
im here because i want to be alone with you
i want to see the candle light dance in your beautiful uh oh
castor cant tell the color of eves eyes
he leans in romantically but we know the real reason
he smells her hair then her shoulders her skin
shes aroused but wary
so castor goes in for the kill
i wanted it all to be just right
when i told you about my promotion
well i dont have it yet
but lazarros getting old he wont be around forever
and im getting the itch to move up
so you see im not going anywhere
unless its upstairs with you
castor carries eve into the shower and spins on the water
he rips her blouse open on her like a vulture to carrion
as they drop to the floor of the stall water filling up around them castor licks her ear and whispers
baby its like im having you for the first time
dirty water runs down a floor drain
pull back to desolate archer mops down the rec area
dont they ever let us take off these boots
not unless youre sent to the clinic
you mean if i get sick
they dont give two fucks about your health
the clinics where they send the real hard cases for attitude adjustment
dubov just got sent down and look at wainwright voisine gestures to a dazed inmate nearby wainwright who sits in a corner gnawing at his knuckles
toughest bastard i ever saw after you of course
now hes a fucking drool case
what did he do
he hit a guard
archer sees walton hovering nearby
archer heads for him
looking for trouble castor
as a matter of fact yes
archer decks walton
walton and a guard herd archer toward a steel door
archer is dumped on the floor
he sees hes lying in a puddle of something
he looks up and recoils
is strapped to a vertical gurney post procedure
his limbs are stiff his eyes blank as a mako sharks
but his feet are bare bootless
wheres the mop he puked all over the place
an assistant unstraps dubov and drops him on a gurney
mopping up next time bring them in before dinner
archer cases the place above is a catwalk
walton muscles archer into the gurney
the med tech smirks
oh happy day castor troy
the med tech wheels the ect head gear cart into place twin needle like bolts ready to fit into archers ears
a single blue static spark jumps from the bolts
walton roughly wedges archers head into the head gear shoving the chewed up bite strap into archers mouth
bite hard scumbag cause youll be gumming baby food from here on out
get his boots sergeant
walton unlocks archers first boot and pulls it off
as the med tech starts to fasten archers arm walton unlocks and pulls off the second boot
archers feet are free
he yanks his foot up hard walton reels back stunned
one arm still restrained archer backrolls in the gurney and kicks the head gear cart away knocking it into the med tech who collapses onto it hitting test zap
the head bolts fire catching the med tech through the shoulder he drops to the floor his synapses shot
seeing that archer is still restrained by the arm the assistant darts out of the room
as archer pulls free walton looms over him gun poised
dubov wallops walton using his boots as brass knuckles
the head guard collapses
dubov smiles dumbly at archer all trace of vendetta now obliterated
archer nods gratefully theyre on the same team
at least for now
suddenly the alarm blares
archer sees guards charging the room
he tries closing the door but the guards arrive
dubov lumbers over and puts his massive weight into it and slams the door shut
guards pound at the now locked door
archer quickly frisks walton coming up with a cigarette lighter
he pockets it
scanning around archer leaps onto a mounted hinged lamp
it swings against the wall
archer uses it to reach the catwalk above
dubov come on
dubov obeys and follows archer up onto the catwalk
a groggy walton muscles open the door from inside
guards pour in
walton grabs an auto rifle and opens slugs chase archer and dubov as they flee through the catwalk door
two guards watch archer and dubov disappear off the clinics monitor
they grab their shock sticks and rush for the door
the door opens revealing dubov and archer
perfectly in synch they double cold cock the startled guards
archer grabs a shock stick and fuses the door shut
he yanks out wires and shatters the computers
dubov mimics the behavior ripping out an entire console and revealing a narrow cable duct
flames explode shorting the circuitry the droning hum rises the magnetic power monitor shows a dangerous surge
guards scatter as the huge diamond vision screen explodes and inmates are flung like rag dolls by their short circuiting boots
anything metallic flies into the magnetic domes
as the men back through the cable duct archer struggles to replace the heavy console
the door is blown open
walton enters to find
then his eyes light on the console slightly askew
archer and dubov rush down the tight corridor and around the bend
the corridor ends in a
lined with tools toilets sinks a rack of old lock down boots
they race through the far door
archer and dubov find themselves in a multi level labyrinth
a hundred feet high criss crossed with catwalks staircases and high walls
echoes resound shouting footsteps getting closer they seem to be coming from all around them
over the magnetic hum archer notices loose screws and other metal debris stuck to the sheer wall
he pulls one screw away and lets it fly back into the polarized wall
archer gets an idea and looks back the way they came
archer and dubov scale the face using the old metal boots
they climb higher and higher as
guards criss cross the catwalks and staircases below and around them oblivious
archer and dubov almost reach the next level when
bullets smack the wall around them just as archer and dubov reach the next catwalk
archer spots the emergency exit security door at the far end
but four guards descend on them and block their way
fist fight as archer and dubov take on the attacking guards
archer heaves one down the stairs into more guards
dubov drops another over the catwalk
they continue their desperate race for the door reaching the landing
as bullets ping around them hulking dubov rips away a floor panel
he uses it as a shield as archer sparks up waltons lighter
as slugs explode into the shield archer places the flame to his thumb
and peels off the skin mold
he presses his thumb to the doors keypad
to his horror its led reads print unreadable
walton and guards movie in firing at closer and closer range
dubov staggers under the fusillade of bullets
the shield is repeatedly punctured and is quickly disintegrating
archer licks his thumb tries again
finally it reads clearance confirmed
the door slides open
dubov heaves the shield at the encroaching guards but as he turns to follow
walton blows him away
archer reaches to pull dubov through but the riddled inmate ignores the helping hand
pulling the door shut he collapses in front of it blocking it momentarily
archer hesitates for a moment
but thats all he has
he keeps going
up the winding staircase catwalk higher and higher a step ahead of the onrushing guards
as bullets clang around him archer reaches the top
he ignores a sign which reads
he charges straight up a ladder and plows right through archers blinded its daytime in the real world
a sea gull flies across his face as we follow the bird
pull way way back to reveal the prisons in the middle of the goddamn ocean in what appears to be just an abandoned rusty oil rig platform
archer rushes over to a transport chopper
archer searches for the keys
he throws switches
guards pour out of the hatch firing
archer leaps from the chopper and jumps over the side to the platforms he lands hard on the slanted corrugated shed roof and rolls to the ground
he grabs a high pressure hose and cranks the pressure valve as the pursuing guards close in
archer blasts the guards with the water cannon knocking walton and others into the sea
archer upends a stack of oil barrels which roll into more guards
archer spots pulling a zodiac dinghy heading out to sea
archer jumps up a stack of pipes to the south rail where the end of a cranes hook is tagged back
under fire archer frees the hook which swings away from the platform
hanging on to the hook it swings him out over the ocean
at the apex le lets go and plummets down into
he pulls himself into the zodiac and frees it from the tug
it roars off
the nylon craft zips through the waves approaching san pedro harbor
the engine sputters
low on gas
archer senses something
he looks up and
something swoops down but its just a pelican
he fiddles with the engine which finally dies
archer grabs the oars about to start rowing when another swoop
this time its the prison chopper
archer spots a string of buoys dotting the harbor
the chopper settles over the zodiac
wind and water swirl around archer
walton drenched but obviously rescued has archer in his sights
he starts to fire his machine guns
bullets rain down on the boat destroying it as archer dives into the rolling swells
walton rakes the debris shredding it
the chopper does a final circle of the wreckage
then moves off
its rotor wash thrashing the buoy
archer has crawled up into the hollow buoy sucking air
castor dressed looks down at her like cortez at montezuma triumphant with overwhelming power
heading for the car castor is about to light up when last night i thought this isnt my husband
he pockets the smoke
eve is there dressed somberly
then i woke up in the middle of the night and found you passed out in the study
i couldnt sleep you roll around a lot
jingles car keys anyway im late
jon you know what day it is
i know its difficult for you but we still have to go
cant we skip it just this once
i gotta protect and serve you know
protect and serve later
okay if you insist
but you drive
he climbs into the front seat beside her
a pastoral hilly area near the coast
so whos this karl creep jamies been seeing
hes a little old for her isnt he
i dont know
theyre about the same ages we were when we met
smiles remember the all night dentist
sure how could i forget
changes subject by the way you never said anything about last night
he moves closer stroking her hair as his beeper sounds
arent you going to get that
he turns his beeper off then touches her lips with his finger
without knowing exactly why eve tenses up
jon this is hardly the time or place
castor looks around in surprise because he sees shes driving into they drive through the gates passing a church marked st
marys by the sea
nearby the ocean roars
its beautiful here striking and sad
now on foot castor follows eve up a bluff through a phalanx of graves with no idea where shes leading him
finally she stops at a crucifix topped headstone
castor joins her and reads the etched marble stone matthew archer age beloved son brother we cherish you always stunned castor watches as eve kneels beside the marker
happy birthday matty
she places a few childs toys on the marker
a little bulldozer
overwhelmed with grief she collapses into castor
he took our baby jon
he took our little boy
he stares at the grave of the boy he killed the boy whose mother is weeping into his chest
the ever present smirk is long gone as castor stiffly returns eves embrace maybe just maybe feeling the victims pain
shaking off his funk castor arrives at the office
you picked a helluva day to leave your beeper off
somehow he escaped from erewhon
but a prison chopper mowed him down just off long beach harbor
wheres the body
it hasnt been recovered yet
it hasnt been recovered yet
you people have no idea who youre dealing with
beat i want everyone on this reports on the half hour and all leads get routed through my office
buzz alert the l
even if he is alive castor isnt stupid enough to come back to the city
hes alive and hes already here
something bobs up in the surf
archer is thrashed ashore by the breakers
he crawls gasping onto the sand
he takes a few breaths then staggers up onto the beach
archers heart sinks as he sees the yellow police cordon taped across titos front door
some teenage cholos notice him so archer keeps right on going
a rear window is forced open archer pulls himself in
in the dim light he sees the bullet hole on the wall
then the blood stains within the forensics chalk marks
he buckles and has to sit down
taking a deep breath he picks up the phone and dials
its an emergency
listens her husband
he pinches his throat trying to dislodge the vocal implant
his voice scrambles into garbled static
hello eve i know this sounds crazy but reverting back dammit
eve deftly stitches up a gash above little iriss eye
how did this happen sweetie
she fell off her big wheel
something about his too quick response rankles eve
she eyes the yuppy dad with suspicion then notes some bruises on the childs arm
a nurse enters
archer your husbands on three
get child services down here and dont let her father leave
goes to wall phone jon
intercut archer and eve as necessary
eve listen carefully
the man you think is your husband isnt
who is this
please just listen
take jamie and go to your mothers in santa fe
dont tell him where youre going just go
whoever you are dont call again
archer sags in futility
a siren snaps him back to reality
archer goes to the window and carefully peers out
a squad car roars into view then continues on its way
i need to speak to director lazarro immediately
i have information about castor troy
archer rifles the room
finding car keys
a baggy jacket
this is jon archer
hearing his own voice speaking to him
well if youre jon archer
i guess this must be castor troy
ive gotta hand it to you jon
youre doing a damn respectable job of being me
but lets face it we both liked it better the way it was
so before the cops blow your brains out why not tell me where you are
if you were really me youd know no discussion no deals
archer hangs up leaving castor stewing
the automatic door lifts revealing titos old buick
the big v rumbles as archer pulls out
he doesnt get far as
menacing cholos block his way
where are you going
ten bucks hes the guy who popped tito
the cholos surround the buick
archers cornered like an animal as the angry teens pound on the windows
archer hits the gas scattering all except cholo who jumps on the hood
archer slams the brakes sending the guy flying
he lands hard but is only shaken up
as archer roars off cholo pulls out his cell phone
i want to report a stolen car and dont put me on hold
archer drives on listening to kfwb
the escapee is considered extremely dangerous
if you have any information concerning the whereabouts of castor troy
he shuts it off as he sees in the distance fbi and lapd vehicles are parked in front
no way hes getting near there
in his rearview mirror archer spots a cop car approaching
he quickly turns a corner as the cop slowly cruises by
you have to think like castor
where would he go
archer gets an idea
but as he drives on the cop car backs up and reappears into frame
dietrich locks up his chic art gallery
he gets in his lexus and drives out of the parking lot
dietrich slows down to check out the forensics team swarming all over titos parked buick
dietrich quickly averts his face as he spots
jon archer inspecting titos buick
some poor schmucks in big trouble
with surprising speed dietrich yanks a pistol from someplace and jerks around archer hunkered down in the back seat stares into the barrel of dietrichs pistol
jesus christ castor
and punch up your cellular i need you to make some calls
youre gonna get me busted
youre already busted dietrich
its just a matter of time before they pick you up
dietrich snakes the car past the crime scene and speeds off
man when you came to me about that bomb i knew i should have blown you off
but thats my fucking curse i just cant say no to a friend
you cant say no to money
thats my other curse
cars pull up in front of a gentrified loft amid the low rent streets
emerging from them are several thugs including aldo fitch and their sexy girl friends livia and cindee
archer splashes water on his face then stops and listens as the doorbell rings
he screws up his courage
youre castor troy
this is your old crew you dont take shit and you dont take no for an answer
the thugs admire the loft dominated by an enormous in progress mural and stunning glass bricked floor
helluva place dietrich
so whats the big surprise
the men are stunned the women beam
are you crazy
youre going to bring the feds down on all of us
archer doesnt want you he wants me
but im going to get him first with your help
archers a damn celebrity now hes untouchable and youre radioactive
he turns to leave
archer wheels him around and smashes him into the wall
aldo goes for his gun but archers too quick he strips him of it
the four bodyguards draw their weapons and surround archer
you wanna face off with castor troy
come on then
cause ive had a real bad day
four against one and everyones sweating but archer
one by one the bodyguards back off
archer points the gun at aldo then smiles and hands it back
youre all forgetting who the real enemy is
to aldo six months ago jon archer hauled you in for questioning
he rattled you so bad you shit your armani suit right there in the interrogation room
aldo blanches how did castor know that
you laugh fitch the way archer laughed at your last arraignment when you got down on your knees and tried to blow your way to freedom
stunned fitch cringes as everybody cracks up
we all have a reason to hate jon archer
we all want to see him dead and nobodys untouchable if we say hes not
the thugs exchange a glance
reading each other
its all worked out
caz has archers routine down cold
we start with your basic kidnapping
then a little surgery
im going to rearrange his face in a way you wont believe
youre an evil bitch caz
but youve got balls of titanium
count us in
archer sighs with relief pleased with his performance
come on lets drink to it
dietrich cracks it open powder sifts into a big high ball glass filled with mescal
he hands it to archer
how about one of your famous toasts caz
they all look expectantly at archer
hes at a loss
to old jobs new jobs and uh blow jobs
silence then they crack up
reluctantly archer swallows the tumbler of mescal
he fights back the urge to puke
enough business caz
she drags him onto the glass floor
cindee puts on some music as archers head begins to spin
the girls start dancing grinding archer between their taut bodies
he tries to avoid it but livia kisses him hot moist
remember the chargers game caz
the owners box
we did it four times
sure i remember
once a quarter right
archers eyes fall on the series of abstract paintings
the twisted renderings make his head spin worse
as he starts to hallucinate
surrounded by enemies he struggles to regain control of his battered psyche
are you okay
he pulls away and stumbles down the stairs toward the kitchen
when even castor troy cant handle a tab of quantrex
raises his glass that dear friends is the first sorry whiff of old age
archer has his mouth under the tap drinking greedily
woozy he takes a breath
and notices a reflection in the window above the sink
archer turns to see sasha
met castor troy in austin texas at pearl jam reunion
catches himself uh how you doing baby
she responds by slapping him hard
what the hell are you doing here
youre supposed to be dead
he wobbles then falls flat on his face
castors chain smoking looking out over the city wondering where archer might be hiding
but something breaks his rumination
he sees a bmw pulls up to the curb
the thumping music from within goes quiet but no one emerges
curious castor approaches the car keeping a safe distance
he can see jamie inside struggling with karl
he shushes jamie but doesnt stop pawing her
my father hes got a gun hell hell pulls open belt that wimp wont do shit
the passenger window explodes inward
castor drags karl out by his hair
jamie scrambles out and flees toward the house as
who are you to call jon archer a wimp
castor heaves karl into the windshield spider webbing it
somehow the kid finds his feet and stumbles behind the wheel
the beemer lurches away
castor enters to find jamie still shaken up
what are you stupid
thats just like you
some guy tries to rape me and you side with him
did it look like i was siding with him
she falls silent you want to play with scummy organ grinders you better be prepared
do you have protection
you mean like
i mean like
with a fluid motion castor expertly snaps open a well oiled switchblade and hands it to an astonished jamie
next time slip it in low then twist it so the wound doesnt close
she hugs him tight taking castor by surprise
but he responds momentarily
about to pat her rump something makes him stop
go on get out of here
jamie kisses him and heads up stairs
after shes gone
no wonder he spent all his time chasing me
who can deal with this family shit
the phone rings
he rushes to the den and picks it up
immediately alert where is he
using night vision goggles pollux watches sasha close her drapes
visible in the b
on the sofa is archer
into cell phone i thought he might visit some old friends of yours
and bro if i didnt know better id swear this guy likes being you
sasha is tugging off his pants
uh cant we just talk
the only talk i ever heard from you was take it off sit on it ill pay you tomorrow
she pulls out some fresh clothes and dumps them on him
take off the rest of those rags and get dressed
then get out
not until i finish my business with your brother
i told him to keep those creeps away but youre just too big an attraction
calming herself look if the f
finds out youve been here ill lose my son
so please just go
for the first time archer sees not a hardened felon but a frightened protective mother
and he realizes the effect his own relentless obsession has had on her
i know ive done some things that made your life harder
how would you
you walked out and never looked back
adam enters heading for his toys his presence cooling sashas deep seated anger
archer finishes dressing
im not the same person you remember
and for what its worth im sorry
her harsh look softens imperceptively like that of a woman trying to hate someone she still loves
not a bad fit
nice looking kid too of course he is
sasha fidgets struggling with a deep inner turmoil
adam come here
i want you to meet your father
archers face pales over in shock
their silhouettes are visible against the shades
castor buzz wanda and loomis peer at the silhouettes
into cellular weve got him sighted
okay pollux pull out
what makes you so sure this guys gonna set up his own brother
ive never been more certain of anything
get everyone in position
remember shoot to kill
before buzz can object castors eyes say dont argue
you heard the man lets saddle up
playing with his toys adam does not see archers icy gaze
how old is he
no one knows youre his father
i thought someone might want to hurt him just to hurt you
startled they turn to see adam pointing a toy gun at them
upset she takes it from his hands
you know mommy doesnt like you playing with these things
she kicks the toy aside and lifts adam offering him to archer
awkwardly archer takes the boy
archers emotions avalanche as his grip tightens his big hands dwarfing the little boys body
youre not holding him right
archer isnt hearing sasha
hes lost in his own memory
the sound of a carousel
a kids laughter
then adam smiles perhaps the way matthew once smiled
it pulls something up from inside archer something strong
he regains control dumping the child into sashas arms
hes not my son
yes he is
then something alerts archer maybe the fleeting shadows that blot out the window light for the barest second
k boom boom boom boom
the window panes shatter as teargas grenades and gunfire riddles the loft
across the way castor directs the firepower
a bodyguard is mowed down
dietrich and the others scatter and hit the floor
cindee and fitch are caught in flagrante delicto on the floor as the kitchen is decimated by gunfire
coughing archer crawls through the roiling smoke toward the door
hes almost out when
her wail of fear freezes archer
he looks back and sees adam in the eye of the firestorm
archers face betrays his conflict
a child but his worst enemys child
bullets shred the wall around adam
archer moves he crawls toward adam
just then a swat agent rappels in through one of the shattered windows his weapon poised
archer kicks him hard pitching him back through the window
archer grabs adam curling him into his body
thinking fast he soaks his discarded t shirt into a toppled flower vase then places it over adams face
he rushes to sasha
together they barrel through the soft paper wall and tear out an escape route
firing out the window fitch is riddled from outside by an agent as he crashes through the window
cindee slashes the agent with a cleaver
he fires blasting cindee into the refrigerator
archer hustles sasha and adam toward the staircase when explodes open
swat agents swarm to get in firing and throwing flash grenades
are caught out in the open when dietrich et al open fire down on the attacking agents
agents drop or are driven back out
bursts open and agents rappel down firing
aldos bodyguard falls riddled off the upper level
as one agent lands archer knocks his gun to the floor
as the agent reaches for it adam appears and kicks the gun away
just like mommy
scoops up the kicked weapon and cold cocks another rappelling agent
then she fires cutting a third rappelling agents rope
he drops hard to the floor unconscious
still grappling archer rips off the agents gas mask
buzzs eyes reveal only hatred
he reaches for his knife
archer hesitates then heaves buzz through the glass door
he pushes adam upstairs as more agents pour in the front door
dietrich sees the canvas mural above the breached front door and understands
he opens fire cutting loose the mural
it collapses billowing and enshrouds the attacking agents and buying time
archer and sasha flee up the stairs
sasha sees adam huddled in the middle of the glass floor the shadows of agents moving below
an agent aims his shotgun at the glass floor at the target kneeling on top of it
archer dives and grabs the boy as the glass floor explodes up
he rolls through a shower of glass but comes up with adam safely
agents and thugs fire blindly upward and downward through the floor desperate to hit their targets
agents open fire from the girders supporting the roof cutting down fitchs last bodyguard
theyre like cockroaches
dietrich and livia toss smoke grenades into the loft covering their escape
dietrich leads them to the very back of the loft
he pulls open a hidden door
if we make it well meet up at my malibu place
you remember it caz
off kanan road i know it
archer hands adam over to sasha
she hugs her little boy then embraces archer tightly
hanging on near tears because she knows this may be the last time
thank you caz
get the boy out of here
livia and the remaining bodyguard hustle archer out mac poised livia and the bodyguard rush archer through the deserted rotunda boom
his escorts drop
castor rushes down the staircase blasting at archer
unarmed archer instantly disappears behind one of the eight columns
the columns are separated by mirrored panels
cat and mouse as castor slips in and out between column and mirror
he spots archer dead ahead and blasts away
the mirror shatters into a thousand pieces
thats about a thousand years bad luck
castor whirls spots archer again and fires
sensing archer behind him castor turns and fires again this time blasting away his own then archer leaps through a shattered mirror frame and onto castor
they battle for control of the pistol
its too late jon
your kid loves me
and your wifes an animal
even i cant keep up with her
theyre so close castors whispering right in archers ear
tonight im going to make her come like niagara falls to celebrate your death
castor licks archers ear salaciously
enraged archer tears the pistol from his grip and turns it on castor
hes got castor dead to rights suddenly bullets shred the world around him
archer staggers away as loomis enters firing his m as archer dives for a doorway
loomis fires the m s grenade launcher
the grenade explodes the doorway bursts into flames but archer has made it through
loomis tries to help up castor who pushes him off angrily
castor cant follow through the flames
archer slams out of the interior stairwell but bullets force him to take cover behind the cupola
pollux fires at him from the other side
archer returns fire driving pollux back
your baby brother
trying to get the drop pollux carefully crawls onto the top of the cupola
you tricked me into telling you things i never told anyone
archer hears movement above him as pollux reaches the crown
now take it to your grave
archer fires his pistol into the glass cupola and shatters the glass beneath polluxs feet
the cupola disintegrates beneath his weight
he plunges down into castor watches in horror as pollux pancakes onto the floor at his feet
pollux is almost gone
castor looks up and sees peering down into the rotunda
ducks the bullets as he disappears
castor desperately holds pollux to no avail
pollux slips away
he turns to loomis
get a medic now
forget him sir
its only pollux troy
without hesitation he jerks up his gun and puts a bullet right in the middle of loomiss forehead
castor looks at the dead kid his rage barely abated as buzz and wanda arrive on the scene and see loomiss body
what the fuck do you think happened
castor troy just shot him
beat what are you waiting for
after buzz and wanda take off castor gathers pollux up in his arms totally devastated
dazed castor approaches his office
kim proudly holds a copy of time magazine
his photo is on the cover
sir youre on the cover of time
theyre calling you an authentic american hero
he just pushes by her and goes into his office
alone castor picks up the framed photo of eve and jamie staring at it with unbridled hatred
fury rising he crumples the frame and the photo in his clenching grip
he hurls it into other archer family memorabilia shattering more photos and souvenirs
only then does castor notice lazarro standing in the doorway
for how long he cant be sure
what is it
lazarro shuts the door behind him
we were friends once jon so i feel i owe it to you to tell you face to face
a beat i dont care how much hype youre getting youre through
after that massacre last night im ordering a full inquiry into your recent erratic and deeply suspect behavior
victor what are you talking about
castor casually closes the blinds between the offices
you start meeting with brodie and miller
then they die mysteriously
your best friend is murdered and you dont seem to give a shit
suddenly youre smoking drinking acting like a man with something to hide
beat maybe youve been bought maybe youve lost your mind
but i promise
im going to find out
eye to eye
castor knows he cant finesse this one
okay vic i have a confession to make
but you arent gonna like it
wraps arm around neck im castor troy
i dont understand
castor suddenly jabs his fist into lazarros chest
he pleads for mercy as castor pounds and pounds away at his heart until it finally seizes up
lazarro twitches in a death throe then slumps to the ground
now you understand
he punches up the intercom button
cancel my four oclock
beat and send for the paramedics
victor lazarros having a heart attack
castor fixes himself a shot of mescal
he checks his watch as if counting then kneels beside lazarros body
the door flies open and two medics rush in
they see castor vigorously pumping lazarros chest applying the medics gently nudge castor aside
one medic takes lazarros pulse then shakes his head
castor peers down over the city
trying to collect himself
he lights up a smoke
planning his next move
his meditation is broken as a police chopper circles above
lapd choppers circle
squad cars prowl
cops and fbi agents set up roadblocks
the city is being sealed off
skirting a roadblock archer appears to be coming undone
wobbly wild eyed
he suddenly picks up a trash can and carries it down the street in front of his face
pedestrians gawk at this madman
whats he doing
archer finally stops in front of a sporting goods store
he swings the trash can
the stores window shatters
an alarm blares
passersby stare at archer for a moment stunned
then several youths leap into the window and start pulling merchandise out of the store
mayhem as others join in
clerks rush out to do battle
an lapd squad car hauls up onto the curb
a cop leaps out and chases as the looters scatter
the driver stands at his door radio in hand
sensing something he turns
just as archer grabs the canister of comply gas from the cops belt
archer sprays him in the face
the cop gags and sags
archer quickly slips behind the wheel
inside archer hits a switch the cars tinted windows darken automatically obscuring him from the outside
he hits the gas screaming away
archer slows the squad car
up ahead parked cop cars block both lanes of the main road a roadblock checkpoint for all traffic
archer pulls off the road out of sight
he flips open the portacomp and starts to type rapidly
a dispatchers scanner clicks to life
i have a confirmed code zero zero priority alert
proceed at once to parthenia street terminal
thats parthenia at nordhoff
tac squads pile into armored jeeps
choppers lift off and veer east
the surveillance cars roar away
archer watches as the checkpoint of cop cars pulls apart and screams east on the main road passing archer
once the armada is gone he pulls out and heads west
a plank in the fence swings aside as archer slips into the yard
he peers out from behind the garage
a cop sits in a lawn chair tuning a police band radio
archer approaches the bird feeder
quietly he sticks his hand inside and searches for the key
just when he grabs it caw caw an annoying bluebird hovers over archer
the cop looks over but archer is gone
all lars sees is the bird
wanda is shocked to see him
commander what are you doing here
where should i be
looks around wheres everyone else
backing you up
didnt you track castor to the parthenia street terminal
you radioed in your personal security code
nobody knows that code but you
obviously someone else knows it
get everybody back to their posts now
archer tiptoes through the house listening
he sees cop sitting at the dining room table cleaning his pistol
he slips upstairs toward the sound of archer walks in and steps toward the bathroom passing the bed
on top of the rumpled covers eves nightgown and a pair of castors black briefs
overwhelmed he sits down not noticing the water has stopped
eve steps in from the bathroom
the look of horror on her face snaps him back to reality
she runs but archer grabs her
she struggles fighting and kicking him but somehow he keeps her mouth covered
im not going to hurt you
just dont scream okay
no response okay
terrified she finally nods and he eases off her
i know you youre the one who called
youre castor troy
you killed my son i called but im not castor
im your husband
archer holds onto her as she struggles again
now youre going to listen
the last time we saw each other was in this room
we had a fight after i told you i had to go away
a beat my assignment jon archers assignment was to enter a federal prison as castor troy
eve is startled by this intimate information but she reveals nothing
sirens approach the house the cops are returning
she keeps an eye on the door
playing for time
how did he expect to do that
surgeon gave me castors face
he handled the transplant the vocal implant everything
but somehow castor came out of his coma and killed everyone who knew about the mission
but not before he was transformed into me
the back door clicks open
a voice booms out
archer are you okay
if you need hard evidence get it
your husbands blood type is o negative
castors is a
archer glances at the balcony as footsteps clomp up the stairs
eve is about to answer or scream
remember the parachute dream
im falling eve
the blood drains from her face as
archer slips over the balcony and disappears
eve is at the computer dazed and disoriented
she snaps alert on hearing the front door open castor is giving orders to the cops guarding the house
i want you guys here around the clock
and stay off the lawn
eve feigns interest in her laptop as castor enters
she tenses as he starts massaging her back
youre all in knots
maybe another date night will help you relax
im way behind in my continuing ed
he studies eve then grasps her firmly by the shoulders
you think ive been acting strange
like a completely different person
okay i have a confession to make
but you arent going to like it
castor wraps his hands around her slender neck
castor contd i read your diary
ive been trying to change trying to be more like the man you want me to be
eve reacts to the explanation
there is a logic to it
and to prove it im taking you and jamie away on a trip right after the memorial service
what memorial service
victor lazarro had a heart seizure
right in my office
it was horrible
oh my god
castor pours it on feigning immense grief
holds her tight please dont tell me im going to lose you too
returns the embrace of course not
castor slumbers fitfully
suddenly his shoulder twitches rousing him
he looks up to find eve reading beside him
what was that
what was what
something bit me
probably a mosquito ill close the window
eve rubs castors shoulder blade until he falls asleep
she gets up closes the window then goes into the bathroom
eve takes a breath then produces a lancet from her pocket
she squeezes the lancet and a drop of blood splashes into a glass vial castors blood
as eve gets the key in her car door a hand grabs her
she stifles a scream then sees
the two cops
where are you going at this hour
theres been an emergency at the hospital
one of us will have to escort you
a beat but please dont wake my husband
nothing happening here at a
the bored cop keeps watch outside as eve hustles in
eve paces anxiously as the blood analyzer clicks away
please be o neg
the machine stops clicking
it reads male type ab
she buries her face in her hands completely stunned
thanks for believing me
archer emerges from the darkness of her office but eve pulls a pistol aiming it with calm authority
what are you doing
where did you get that gun
i took it from my fake husband
why point it at me
im the real thing
i dont know that
maybe jons already dead
what more proof do you need
tell me about the all night dentist
as archer speaks eve searches his eyes for the truth
i took a date out for chicken and ribs not knowing she was a vegetarian
when the night couldnt get worse she broke her tooth on a pebble that got into her three bean salad somehow she and i had fun driving around looking for
an all night dentist
a beat and even though it must have hurt you still kissed me
eve slowly puts the gun down fighting off tears
how could you put us in this position
do you know do you know what he did to me
whatever happened whatever he did i know its my fault and i know i can never make it up to you she pulls herself together regaining her composure
but youre damn well going to try
a beat first how are we going to get you out of this
castor wakes up and finds eve gone
his eyes narrow as he touches the mosquito bite the one that isnt there
eve sifts through the supply cabinet and finds a yellow vial
this will knock him out for hours
whats his schedule tomorrow
he doesnt tell me anymore than you ever did
all i know is tomorrow were going to victors memorial service
they both died thinking i killed them
and in a way
jon you cant think about that now
archer takes a breath and pulls himself together
what happens after the memorial
hes taking jamie and me away
and neither of you will be coming back
wheres the service
saint marys by the sea
the ironys not lost on him
what are you going to do
hit him with a trank dart
once hes unconscious ill try to get to buzz and wanda before the security team gets to me
what else can i do
think up a good excuse
i dont want you or jamie anywhere near that service
i can cover for jamie
but if im not there hell suspect something
as archer considers the second you make your move all hells going to break loose
if im there beside him i can take charge
im his wife remember
a beat theres no way around it for once you need me
archer looks into her eyes the regrets flooding over
ive always needed you
soaking up each others warmth
jon what are the odds
but its the best we can do with what we have
a beat if it doesnt happen take jamie and dont look back
footsteps approach they break their embrace
do doctors travel in packs
only when were golfing
castor and the twins round the bend just in time to see the door to the burn ward close
eve quickly wraps gauze around a patients head when castor and his boys rush in guns leveled
what are you doing here
thats what youre going to explain to me
didnt the police tell you
there was an emergency
lars starts pulling at the patients bandages
jon stop it
alandro is very ill
not as ill as hes going to be
he blanches as lars reveals a scarred burn victim mr
eve is livid as she attends to the patient
but whats a guy to think when his wife runs off in the middle of the night
its my fault
i shouldve woken you up before i left
kisses him now please let me get back to work
eve wipes his ugly taste from her mouth
castor gets into his car as he confabs with the twins
watch her like a hawk
think she knows
shes going to be dead by tonight anyway
theyre all going to be dead
the wife the kid
and the father
archer waits as sasha appears with a long case
in the b
adam plays on the ranch house porch with dietrich
hows the boy
his ears are still ringing but hell be okay
archer opens the case
inside is a sniper rifle
the trucks all gassed up
look caz therell be f
agents all over that place
maybe i can talk my brother into helping us
no sasha believe me this isnt your fight
he turns to leave but her look draws him back
he kisses her not passionately but nobly
she watches him as he walks off toward the truck
dressed in staid black eve joins castor at the limo
thats what id like to know
she stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off
castors eyes narrow trying to read eve
dont act so stunned jon
you know how hard it is to get that girl into a dress
ill deal with her later
because i am fed up
a crucifix gleams in the sun
and anchoring the crucifix is
like so many others except this headstone is matthew archers
and hidden behind it is jon archer
he finishes assembling the sniper rifle
for a moment he acknowledges matthews grave
the regrets giving way to determination
he looks down from his vantage point onto at the foot of the cemetery knoll
rows of chairs
a yacht is docked at the breakwater
peers down through scope seeing
castor and eve as they emerge from their limo
eve glances around searching for archer
she comes eye to eye with lars who is watching her every move
archer tracks castor and eve as they sit in the front row
the ceremony begins
we are here to celebrate the life of victor lazarro
we all know him as a man who dedicated himself to defending this great nation first as a highly decorated admiral then as west coast director of the f
but not all of you know what a deeply spiritual man he was
it was his wish that his requiem mass be performed in latin
a beat in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti
the priest begins to recite a beautiful and somber mass
fills the trank dart with sedative
continues the solemn ritual
domine de morte aeterna in die illa tremenda quando caeli movendi sunt et terra
checks her watch
barely lifting her eyes away
castor absently pats her knee
shes forced to return focus to the service
chambers the dart twists a knob on the range finder and carefully peers over the crucifix
archer tracks through the mourners and finds castor
as the cross hairs neatly cube his head
weve come full circle from matthews death with archer the sniper and castor the target
the priests emotional reciting of the rites climaxes
requiem aeternam dona eis domine
archers finger wraps around he starts to squeeze
crosses behind castor blocking archers shot
archers finger freezes as the figure turns hair tumbling away from her face
eve stiffens as jamie sits down
thanks anyway mom slides her but i wanted to be here for you
castor reads the panic on eves face but says nothing
he simply takes jamies hand intertwining his fingers in hers
the honor guard steps forward shouldering their rifles commencing their gun salute as steadies himself re aims the sniper rifle
he hears motion behind him
someones coming and fast
but this is his only chance
off balance archer squeezes thffft
the silenced trank dart explodes from the barrel
screaming toward castors neck but it goes just wide
it sinks harmlessly into the grass unnoticed during the gun salute
archer is cracked across the head
he slumps down unconscious as a silenced gun barrel gently enters his ear
as the saluting guns fire in the b
we dont know when or if this pistol fires
the honor guard presents the urn to mrs
fearful eve chances a glance around wondering whats gone wrong
the admirals family will now take his ashes to the sea
lazarro and her grown children proceed to the docked yacht castor touches his ear phone
getting a message
his eyes alight on a boathouse
adjacent to the service
into headset lars take jamie bring the car around then meet us at that boathouse
guests head for their cars
eve seizes the moment and steps over to wanda and buzz
wanda i need to talk to you
reads her face sure
but then eve looks past wanda and sees lars looking at her tightening his friendly grip on jamies shoulder
never mind come on baby
ive got a surprise for you
wanda and buzz watch as they head up toward the boathouse
filled with boat parts tools etc
castor hustles eve inside and locks the door behind him
lunt is there standing over a beaten archer
look who we caught creeping around castor troy
why is he here
before i turn him in i thought wed pay him back for everything hes put us through
castor starts kicking archer
over and over in the gut
come on baby
join the fun eve cant stand it
she charges castor but he immediately subdues her
part of me was hoping you didnt know
he throws her down beside archer
she clings to him
did you really think it would be that easy you dumb fucks
to eve sorry baby
castor troy is about to murder you and our daughter
but i promise you wont die unavenged
this is between you and me
leave them out of this
it was between you and me
even your little boy that wasnt supposed to happen
but you couldnt let it go
no father could
appealing to my sense of family wont work jon
i thought you knew me better than that archer plays for time looking for some edge
he sees a crate filled with block and tackle amid the shops tools
i know some things that even you dont know caz
you have a son
ive met him
his name is adam
i imagine ive got a dozen kids so what
cocks pistol no more head games
first your wife dies
then your daughter
castor smiles as the door creaks open
just one big happy family
but its not jamie and lars
three people emerge from the shadows machine pistols poised
dietrich aldo sasha
thats right archer
now drop em
castor and lunt drop their weapons
lars and jamie pull up in the car
lars listens to his headset knows something is wrong
dont fucking move
sashas at archers side
caz are you okay
youre making a mistake
im castor hes archer
sasha baby just give me a minute to explain
thats pathetic archer
but then your terrible sense of humor is legendary
cocks gun its pay back time
aldo aims at castor when boom
hes blown apart
lars charges in blasting
archer grabs a block and tackle as lunt dives for aldos fallen machine pistol
archer swings the block and tackle whacking lunt across the head
castor scoops up his pistol but eve kicks him hard in the balls
he doubles over
archer snatches away the machine pistol
staggered lunt is quickly riddled by dietrich
castor and lars blaze at the now scattering intruders driving them back amid the shots tools and drums
eve crawls through the fusillade toward the exit
among the last to leave buzz and wanda snap alert
over the crashing of the waves did wanda hear something
eve rushes to the car its empty
jamie is gone
bullets shred the windows behind her
during the gun battle we intercut the deaths of dietrich lars and sasha with being scattered at sea
castor and lars riddle sasha
archer fires back killing lars and driving castor back
archer leans beside the mortally wounded sasha
dont let him end up like us
she dies in his arms
wounded dietrich crawls over
seeing his sister dietrich rises in horror
boom boom boom
castor wastes dietrich
archer blasts back driving castor outside
eve runs smack into wanda and buzz theyre on the run
we heard gunshots wanda ive got to tell you something
archer emerges into the maze of dry docked boats
silently checking his clip he discards the empty gun
castor moves stealthily through the narrow paths
hearing a noise behind him boom
castor fires blowing apart an under repair hull
he advances toward the boat gun ready when archer appears behind him and follows one step two steps until castor stops then whirls as archer leaps
the men collapse hard
castors pistol clatters across the yard toward the docked boat
archer and castor brutally strangle each other digging their fingers deep into their throats
they throttle each other so hard archers larynx vocal chip is dislodged
his voice changes echoing with garbled
give up castor
people are going to find out
not if i kill you first
they scramble for the gun but a hand reaches out from the docked boat and picks it up
archer and castor stop dead in their tracks because jamie appears holding the pistol
give it here jamie
dont do it
everybody gawks because archer and castor are now
both speaking in archers true voice
and nobody is more confused than jamie
listen to my voice jamie
im your father
its a trick jamie
im your father
jamie swings the gun back and forth baffled
shoot him jamie
archer reels as a slug grazes his shoulder
castor snatches the pistol from jamies hand
no kid of mine would miss so badly
he aims the gun at archers head
wanda and buzz have burst onto the terrace their guns leveled
eve and more agents are right behind
just saving the taxpayers the cost of a trial
so take a hike
youre both under arrest until a d
test proves whos who
im ordering you to back off
several agents waver unsure
but not wanda and buzz
put the gun down now
beat cant blame me for trying
he grabs a shocked jamie shoving the gun under her chin
archer struggles to his feet as castor using jamie as a shield backs out the gate to the garden
archer follows cautiously
say goodbye to daddy jamie whips out the switchblade sinks it into castors thigh and twists
she dives away
firing wildly castor staggers back through the gate
you ungrateful delinquent
as castor turns and staggers away he runs smack into a confused security agent
give me your weapon now
the agent hands over his uzi and castor plugs him
archer and eve make sure jamies okay
to archer who are you
will someone please tell me whats going on
archer rushes to the gate and hauls it open
limps away from the boatyard towards the slips alive with sunbathers and yachters
castor hustles along until he finds what hes looking for twin cigarette boats racing boats being tuned up by their suntanned crews
he jumps into one of the boats
without even looking castor shoots the guy dead
in a flash castor throttles up the boat
he sees archer running down the dock toward the adjoining boat
fires peppering the dock
archer knocks the boat owner to safety as the bait house blows up behind him
archer rolls into the boat castors hit
a slug grazes his shoulder
he grabs the throttle taking off
fires up the second boat in pursuit
castor blasts back shattering archers boat compass
speeds toward him causing a near miss
running parallel archer and castor blast at each other at point blank range
their boats smash and pound each other
a police boat closes in on them
castor fires at the police obliterating both crew and boat
the police boats rear smashes into archers craft
archers boat plows up and through the other
momentum carries archer across and back into the water
the boat lands right next to castors
archer and castor resume their battering
approaching a pulling a barge
castor forces archer into its path
at the last moment
archer leaps onto the bow of castors boat as ka boom
archers boat crashes into the barge which swerves wildly trying to throw archer off
archer can only watch as castor reaches for another clip
but the boat hits a wave
castor loses the gun which skids away
archer slips his head hanging over the side
castor tries to ram archer but he pulls himself up just in time
castor grabs the anchor swings it
it sinks into the deck beside archer but the chain is around his neck
as castor tries to strangle him archer headbutts castor who reels snagging his leg around the chain
castor falls back plunging toward the water
archer tries to hold castor up
as the boat speeds toward archer yanks castor back onto the deck as the boat bounces off the pier pilings
but as they slug it out
the boat careens off a piling and roars straight for the shipyard
colliding with a shoreline obstruction the boat flips stern over bow
archer and castor go flying
onto the beach
archer and castor lie dazed
castor sees the pistol lying half buried
he reaches for it
but archer gets it first
he aims it at castor as they rise
you wont shoot me jon
okay i have a confession to make
but you arent gonna like it
youre right i wont shoot you
not in the face anyway
boom archer shoots castor in the chest
he jerks and reels dropping to his knees
he looks at archer in total disbelief
then he sinks to the ground and lies still
exhausted archer lets the empty gun drop
then he turns and sees an fbi chopper heading his way
relieved he turns back to castor but castors body is gone
castor is crawling toward the flipped boats spinning stabilizing screw
archer fires hitting castor in the leg
but keeps going
archer leaps on him they struggle as castor tries to bury his face on the spinning blade
itll never be over jon
every time you look in the mirror
youll see my face
they struggle as the propeller blade
gets closer closer slicing into archers cheek
at the last instant
archer reaches the anchor chain
he wraps it around the screw stopping the whirling blades
castor finally sinks to the ground and no longer moves
archer takes castors hand trying to tug off his wedding ring
just when he almost has it off castor suddenly grabs archers wrist and holds it tight
eye contact between the two men
castor smirks his grasp slackening
as he finally fades away
archer lets castors hand drop then slides the ring on his own finger
the chopper lands
buzz and wanda rush over
you okay archer
what did you call me
he called you archer sir
archer finally realizes they actually mean him
he smiles jon archers long lost smile
fbi med teams strap archer onto a gurney
castors inert body is beside him
hang on jon
theyre bringing in their top surgical team from re castor how is he
no life signs at all
hes a turnip
thats what they always say
he passes out as the fbi medics load him onto the med evac chopper
wanda prevents eve from climbing aboard
im sorry eve
you cant come
to buzz take her home
but hes my husband
but he works for us
wanda gets on the med evac chopper it lifts off leaving a furious eve and a confused jamie behind
will dad be dad again
i hope so honey
and you guys say my life is screwed up
in the swirl of dust they watch the chopper fly away
maybe days maybe weeks later no way to tell
eve is at the dining room table catching up on medical reports
sensing something she looks up and sees a silhouette at the front screen door a mans silhouette
pulse pounding eve frantically pushes open the door to glimpse the face of the man with archers voice
its jon archer
eve stares then touches his face carefully tenderly around the tiny residual scar
then she pulls him tight holding on for dear life
jamie is there
archer smiles gently almost sadly with a softness and genuineness that castor troy could never feel could never fake
she rushes to him
the whole family hangs on hugging and kissing for the first time ever really together
im sorry i shot you dad
am i grounded
archer smiles and holds her tighter
but as they draw archer inside he hesitates
i have something to ask you to ask both of you
he steps aside revealing castors son
this is adam
he needs a place to live
just for a little while
eve looks at archer she sees what this means to him and what the hell theres plenty of time now to talk
as the family heads inside the door closes shutting us out
archer gives adam an old teddy bear rocking the child until he finally drifts off into dreamland
archer watches jamie sleep
he draws the comforter over her she stirs and pulls it in tighter
eve gets undressed
waiting for archer
how was your first day back
eve hears water running
she approaches archer whos bent over the sink washing his face
archer stands up revealing castors face in the bathroom mirror
eve chokes back a scream
archer turns and faces her with his true face
he sees her terrified expression turns back to the mirror and sees his own face looking at him
but he understands
he embraces eve
holds her tight
she responds happy to have him home again
we stay on his familiar smile and
