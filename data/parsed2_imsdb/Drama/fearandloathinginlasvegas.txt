b if window
href b b by terry gilliam toy grisoni a desert wind moans sadly
from somewhere within the wind comes the tinkly syrupy sweet sounds of the lennon sisters singing my favorite things
a series of sepia images of anti war protests from the mid sixties appear one after another on the screen
in the violently scrawled style of ralph steadman the title fear and loathing in las vegas splashes onto the screen
a beat and then it runs down and off revealing title he who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man
johnson the voice of hunter s
raoul duke we were somewhere around barstow on the edge of the desert when the drugs began to take hold
a red chevy convertible the red shark wipes the black screen
the red shark races down the desert highway at a hundred miles an hour
the stones sympathy for the devil blares
the music pounds duke stares straight ahead
gonzo froths up a can of beer uses it as shaving foam
i remember saying something like i feel a bit lightheaded
maybe you should drive
gonzo starts shaving
suddenly there was a terrible roar all around us and the sky was full of what looked like huge bats all swooping and screeching and diving around the car
close on duke shadows flutter across his face
the reflections of bats swirl within his eyes
we push in close to one eye ball screeching swirling bat like shapes
and a voice was screaming holy jesus
what are these goddamn animals
duke eyes rigid flails at the air
no bats anywhere
gonzo casually looks over
what are you yelling about
duck screeches to the side of the road
the sudden wrench makes gonzo nick his face with his razor
its your turn to drive
no point mentioning these bats
the poor bastard will see them soon enough
duke hops out of the car keeping an eye out for bats frantically opens the trunk to reveal what looks like a mobile police narcotics lab
duke desperately rifles through the impressive stash
we had two bags of grass seventy five pellets of mescaline five sheets of high powered blotter acid a salt shaker half full of cocaine a whole galaxy of multi
colored uppers downers screamers laughers
also a quart of tequila a quart of rum a case of beer a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls
duke eyes darting madly as he hears what sounds like the shrieks of bats returning grabs an assortment along with another six pack of beer slams the trunk shut and
dives back into the car
not that we needed all that for the trip but once you get locked into a serious drug collection the tendency is to push it as far as you can
the red shark races into the distance
on the ground weakly flapping is a semi squashed slowly dying animal
a gonzo grips the wheel stares maniacally down the road a lousy driver
the only thing that really worried me was the ether
there is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an ether binge
and i knew wed get into that rotten stuff pretty soon
the radio news wars with sympathy for the devil on a tape recorder
an overdose of heroin was listed as the official cause of death for pretty year old diane hanby whose body was found stuffed in a refrigerator last week
gonzo changes the station one toke over the line sweet jesus one toke over the line vies with sympathy
he sings along washes a couple of pills back with a new beer
the red shark fishtails
one toke over the line sweet jesus
muttering to himself one toke
you poor fool
wait till you see those goddamn bats
a lone hitchhiker spots them jumps up and sticks out a thumb
the red shark roars past
then fifty yards down the road
lets give that boy a lift
gonzo wrenches the wheel the red shark swerves to the side of the road
we cant stop here this is bat country
gonzo jams the car into reverse and rockets backwards
the hitchhiker races to the car
a poor okie kid with a big grin
i never rode in a convertible before
then the big grin freezes on the okie kids face at the sight of duke and gonzo looking out at him with hyper normal shit eating smiles
is that right
well i guess youre about ready eh
the hitchhiker hesitates
were your friends
were not like the others
hissing sharply no more of that talk or ill put the leeches on you
duke turns back to the hitchhiker smiles reassuringly
the hitchhiker sits nervously in the back seat as the red shark screams down the road
gonzo sings along to the tape player
the hitchhikers eyes go to the door considers jumping out and taking his chances
duke sweating bullets stares at the hitchhiker in the rear view mirror
how long could we maintain i wondered
how long before one of us starts raving and jabbering at this boy
what will he think then
this same lonely desert was the last known home of the manson family
the hitchhikers eyes notice a thin line of blood trickling down gonzos neck
would he make that grim connection when my attorney starts screaming about bats and huge manta rays coming down on the car
dukes mouth moves intermittently sometimes in sync with the words sometimes not
if so well well just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere
because it goes without saying that we cant turn him loose
hed report us at once to some kind of outback nazi law enforcement agency and theyll run us down like dogs
out loud to himself jesus
did i say that
or just think it
was i talking
did they hear me
reassuringly to hitchhiker its okay
hes admiring the shape of your skull
duke gives the hitchhiker a fine big grin and the hitchhiker giggles nervously
maybe i better have a chat with this boy i thought
perhaps if i explain things hell rest easy
roaring over the road noise the hitchhiker stares at him not blinking
yells the hitchhiker nods giggles terrified
duke climbs into the back seat
because i want you to have all the background
this is a very ominous assignment with overtones of extreme personal danger
im a doctor of journalism
this is important goddamnit
this is a true story
whacks the back of with his fist the car swerves sickeningly then straightens out
screams keep your hands off my fucking neck
the hitchhiker makes a sudden lunge for freedom
duke grabs our vibrations were getting nasty but why
was there no communication in this car
had we deteriorated to the level of dumb beasts
the hitchhiker struggles in panic
to hitchhiker i want you to understand that this man at the wheel is my attorney
hes not just some dingbat i found on the strip
hes a foreigner
i think hes probably samoan
but it doesnt matter does it
are you prejudiced
i didnt think so
because in spite of his race this man is extremely valuable to me
hell i forgot all about this beer
you want one
hitchhiker shakes his head how about some ether
lets get right to the heart of this thing
twenty four hours ago we were sitting in the pogo lounge of the beverly wills hotel
a uniformed dwarf carries a shockingly pink telephone through the glittering tranquil pogo lounge crowd
they are the eloi
hendrix afros and drooping mustaches and bell bottoms and love beads and bells
actresses sip singapore slings and promoters sip actresses in this monied sanitised in the patio section of course drinking singapore slings with mescal on the side hiding from the brutish
realities of this foul year of our lord
the dwarf reaches duke t shirt levis sneakers and shades
gonzo white rayon bellbottoms and a khaki tank top undershirt
they are in the middle of a serious conversation
im telling you the salazar story is getting too complicated
the weasels have started closing in
the dwarf sneers
perhaps this is the call youve been waiting for all this time sir
duke lifts the receiver listens
duke hangs up the phone with the dead pan expression of a that was headquarters
they want me to go to las vegas at once and make contact with a portuguese photographer named lacerda
hell have the details
all i have to do is check into my sound proof suite and hell seek me out
gonzo says nothing for a moment then pounds the table
i think i see the pattern
this one sounds like real trouble
youre going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over
as your attorney i must advise you that youll need a very fast car with no top and after that the cocaine
and then the tape recorder for special music and some acapulco shirts
gonzo tucks his khaki undershirt into his white bellbottoms he means business
this blows my weekend because naturally ill have to go with you and well have to arm ourselves
if a things worth doing its worth doing right
duke and gonzo are up and off
the dwarf chases after them with the very large check in his hand
they sweep out through the lounge door unaware of it swinging back into the face of the pursuing dwarf
i tell you my man
this is the american dream in action
wed be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end
we must do it
what kind of story is this
duke and gonzo emerge
the richest off road race for motorcycles and dune buggies in the history of organized sport
handing parking ticket to valet a fantastic spectacle in honor of some fatback grossero who owns the luxurious mint hotel in the heart of downtown vegas
at least thats what the press release says
their car arrives rusted out smashed door panels
they jump in
were going to have to drum it up on our own
pure gonzo journalism
and theyre off in a cloud of black exhaust as the nose bleeding dwarf stumbles out with the unpaid bill in his hand
the pinto races through shot
getting hold of the drugs and shirts had been no problem
the pinto skids to a halt outside polynesian bar the back window full of hawaiian shirts
but the car and tape recorder were not easy things to round up at on a friday afternoon in hollywood
torn yellow pages with dealers ads ticked off lie in a pile as gonzo yells into a payphone
duke carries over four singapore slings
hang onto it
well be there in thirty minutes
to duke hand over the phone i finally located a car with adequate horsepower and the proper coloring
into phone what
of course the gentleman has a major credit card
do you realize who the fuck youre talking to
dont take any guff from these swine
gonzo slams the phone down now we need a sound store with the finest equipment
one of those new belgian heliowatts with a voice activated shotgun mike for picking up conversations in oncoming cars
we wont make the nut unless we have unlimited credit
you samoans are all the same
you have no faith in the essential decency of the white mans culture
the pinto races down street
the store was closed but the salesman said he would wait if we hurried
theyre stuck in a traffic jam clouds of exhaust
duke but we were delayed en route when a stingray in front of us killed a pedestrain
directly in front of them bloody carnage a covered corpse is loaded into an ambulance by paramedics
we had trouble again at the car rental agency
behind the wheel of the red shark duke grins with satisfaction checking it out
a nervous agent holds out a clipboard
duke signs without looking at the rental papers
you fellas are going to be careful with this car arent you
duke throws the car into reverse roars backwards past the gas pumps to where gonzo is unloading their rusted out car
well good god
you just backed over that two foot concrete abutment and you didnt even slow down
forty five in reverse
and you barely missed the pump
no harm done
i always test the transmission that way
the rear end
for stress factors
gonzo transfers boxes of new sound equipment and a large box of rum and ice into the red shark
are you fellows drinking
were responsible people
he jams the car into low gear and lurches into traffic
the agent runs into the street and helplessly watches them go
theres another worrier
hes probably all cranked up on speed
strange and magical
in the moonlight the silhouetted figures of duke and gonzo as they pack the red shark
we spent the rest of that night rounding up materials and packing the car
then we ate some mescaline and went swimming
the surf crashes in the distance
duke cries out as he dives into the ocean
he lets himself float up through the silvery bubbles
our trip was different
it was to be a classic affirmation of everything right and true in the national character a gross physical salute to the fantastic possibilities of life in this country
but only for those with true grit
dukes intense face
and were chock full of that
my attorney understands this concept despite his racial handicap
but do you
the hitchhiker nods giggles petrified
he said he understood but i could see in his eyes that he didnt
he was lying to me
gonzo clutches his heart
the car veers off the road and screeches to a halt
he slumps over the wheel
wheres the medicine
yes its right here
duke spills out amyl capsules from a tin
dont worry this man has a bad heart
but we have a cure for it
duke and gonzo break amyls apiece inhale deeply
gonzo falls back on the seat staring straight up at the sun
the hitchhiker looks petrified
suddenly flailing his naked arms at the sky turn up the fucking music
my heart feels like an alligator
we must have bass
whats wrong with us
are you goddamn old ladies
turns up music to full volume you scurvy shyster bastard
watch your language
youre talking to a doctor of journalism
laughing uncontrollably what the fuck are we doing out here
somebody call the police
we need help
to hitchhiker pay no attention to this swine
he cant handle the medicine
he begins laughing to the hitchhiker the truth is were going to vegas to croak a scag baron named savage henry
ive known him for years but he ripped us off and you know what that means right
gonzo pulls out a
magnum waves it around
savage henry has cashed his check
were going to rip his lungs out
and eat them
that bastard wont get away with this
whats going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a doctor of journalism
gonzo cracks another amyl
the hitchhiker scrambles out of the car down the trunk lid thanks for the ride
thanks a lot
i like you guys
dont worry about me
yells wait a minute
come back and have a beer
the hitchhiker runs from car
that boy made me nervous
did you see his eyes
laughing jesus this is good medicine
duke glances back at the running hitchhiker
suddenly clambering into the front seat move over
we have to get out of california before that kid finds a cop
the red shark races duke at the wheel straight ahead driving
it was absolutely imperative that we get to the mint hotel before the deadline for press registration
otherwise we might have to pay for our suite
gonzo wrestles with a shaker of cocaine
the top comes off and the powder swirls away on the wind
did you see what god just did to us
god didnt do that
you did it
youre a fucking narcotics agent that was our cocaine you pig
magnum at duke you better be careful
plenty of vultures out here
theyll pick your bones clean before morning
gonzo tears up a blotter of acid
here chew this
its your half of the acid
duke takes his half chews it
how long do i have
maybe thirty more minutes
as your attorney i advise you to drive at top speed
itll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal
are you ready for that
checking into a vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid
it was going to be very close
the red shark screams along the highway past a billboard the red shark pulls up outside the mint
a great banner spanning the street announces the mint
duke can feel the drug surging up inside him
clutching a buckled beer can sweat pouring he stares fixedly at the ticket the attendant gives him
i need this right
ill remember your face
duke stares losing it
there is no way of explaining the terror i felt
duke waits in line at the front desk rigid with pent up energy
gonzos ahead of him muscling in trying to queue jump and failing
i was pouring sweat
my blood is too thick for nevada
ive never been able to properly explain myself in this climate
a couple move off and duke jerks forward stops eyes fixed on the stony female reservations clerk
be quiet be calm
name rank and press affiliation nothing else
duke moves another rigid step closer to the desk the tension almost snapping him in two
gonzos flapping around absolutely no success
something catches dukes eye
he remains rooted his eyes turning to the vegetal paisley patterns on the carpet ignore this terrible drug pretend its not happening
the last people leave with a final stiff move duke comes face to face with the reservations clerk
and as duke stares at her babbling her face begins to morph
he tries to stop it happening by talking faster
duke sags grips the desk white knuckles
hands him an envelope your suites not ready yet
but theres somebody looking for you
her face is changing swelling pulsing
shouts the face of the reservations clerk turns green grows fangs
duke lunges back at gonzo who grips his arm intensely reaches out to take the envelope
i can handle this
this man has a bad heart but i have plenty of medicine
my name is dr
prepare our suite at once
well be in the bar
gonzo manoeuvres duke away from the desk
duke looks back the reservations clerks is now a moray eel green jowls and fangs
the bar oily people quiet music nautical theme
duke and gonzo at the bar a marlin spike hanging on the wall behind them
duke has turned to stone
to the bartender two cuba libres with beer and mescal on the side
opens the envelope whos lacerda hes waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor
i couldnt remember
the name rang a bell but i couldnt concentrate
terrible things were happening all around us
duke is staring rapt terrified
blood flows freely onto the floor
duke keeps his voice low
order some golf shoes
otherwise well never get out of this place alive
its impossible to walk in this muck no footing at all
duke looks up gonzo has disappeared
duke looks around him the entire room has transformed into a room filled with reptiles in clothes drinking and i was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo
and somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things
it wont be long before they tear us to shreds
if you think were in trouble now wait until you see whats happening in the elevators
gonzo removes his sunshades and we see hes been crying
as he speaks he seems to be floating
duke struggles to keep him in his line of vision
i just went upstairs to see this man lacerda
i told him i knew what he was up to
gonzo rallies turns fierce he says hes a photographer
but when i mentioned savage henry he freaked
he knows were onto him
but what about our room
and the golf shoes
a group of reptiles at a table across the room stares at them blood dripping from their fangs
grabbing gonzo trying to hold him still holy shit
look at that bunch over there
theyve spotted us
cut to wider shot duke is holding on to a man standing next to him at the bar
the room has returned to normality
gonzo is sitting in his original position
downs his drink gets up thats the press table
where you have to sign in for our credentials
shit lets get it over with
you handle that and ill check on the room
dont leave me
a television shows the nightly news
a buddhist monk protesting the war sets himself on fire
a very nervous bell boy is laying out gonzos order
a marlin spike is on the floor next to duke
four club sandwiches four shrimp cocktails
theres a big
machine in the sky
some kind of electric snake
duke is curled by the window mesmerized by an unseen neon sign outside the window
his eyes fill with a million colored lights
a quart of rum
coming straight at us
i want to study its habits
and nine fresh grapefruit
well need all we can get
gonzo sees the bell boy out the door turns and lays into look youve got to stop this talk about snakes and leeches and lizards and that stuff
its making me sick
duke stares hears the drone of b bombers
on tv the laos invasion a series of horrifying newsreel footage of mai lai massacre and the lieutenant calley court martial
what are you talking about
theyll never let us back in that place
i leave you alone for three minutes and you start waving that goddamn marlin spike around yelling about reptiles
you scared the shit out of those people
they were ready to call the cops
hell the only reason they gave us press passes was to get you out of there
a knock at the door
duke and gonzo break out in a sweat
oh my god
gonzo sticks his gun in his waistband opens the door to lacerda bouncing with puppy dog enthusiasm
gonzo stares at a man he instantly hates watches him with deep suspicion
im lacerda your photographer
got your press passes
too bad you missed the bikes checking in
my what a sight
duke watches the b s drop their bomb loads
looking down to the thick patterned carpet duke sees the bombs explode like vicious flowers
duke looks up lacerda is a war photographer bruised filthy and blood spattered
lacerda approaches him talking a foreign language
couple of triumphs here and there a cz
all very fast
what a race its gonna be
duke screws up his eyes wills normality back
lacerda is now just a keen photographer
l well we start at dawn
get a good nights sleep
i know i will
and with a cheerful wave hes gone
duke is in shock
weakly thats good
i think hes lying to us
i could see it in his eyes
even weaker theyll probably have a big net for us when we show up
dukes attention returns to the devastation on the tv
turn that shit off
gonzo kills the tv
never lose sight of the primary responsibility
cover the story
but what was the story
nobody had bothered to say
against a big orange sun on a concrete slab men fire shotguns into the dawn sky
clay pigeons shatter
the mint gun club
next to them motorcycles rev preparing for the mint race a hundred bikers mechanics and assorted motorsport types milling around in the pit area taping headlights topping off oil in
the forks last minute bolt tightening
duke wanders through
the racers were ready at dawn
but the race didnt start until nine so we had three long hours to kill
a sign by a long trestle table koffee donuts
duke walks past ignoring the smiling lady behind the stall
those of us who had been up all night were in no mood for coffee and donuts
we wanted strong drink
we were after all the absolute cream of the national sporting press and we were gathered here in las vegas for a very special assignment
and when it comes to things like this you dont fool around
a real pit of iniquity
the absolute cream of the national duke is at the bar engaged in drunken conversation with a life reporter
showing him his notebook
kill the body and the head will die
the frazier ali fight
a proper end to the s
ali beaten by a human hamburger
and both kennedys murdered by mutants
a shout goes up from outside
the sound of engines revving
in a sudden rush the press crowd make for the door taking duke with them
motorcycles rev tension builds
a flag goes down
the crowd cheers
the motorcycles roar away
a great cloud of dust goes up obscuring the racers as they disappear into the desert
well thats that
theyll be back in an hour or so
lets go back to the bar
the crowd turns and streams back into the tent
duke heads for the bar along with the rest
drinks are ordered
a shout from outside the tent goes up group
the crowd rushes for the door
duke gets swept along
a flag goes down
the crowd cheers
the motorcycles roar away
another great cloud of dust goes up
the crowd head back for the bar
the crowd surge back to the bar
this time duke fights his way free of the crowd
there was something like more bikes waiting to start
they were due to go off at a time every minutes
duke hits the bar
a middle aged hoodlum in a t shirt booms up to the bar
what day is this saturday
more like sunday
thats a bitch aint it
last night i was home in long beach and somebody said they were runnin the mint today so i says to my old lady man im goin
so she gives me a lot of crap about it so i start slappin her around and the next thing you know two guys i never seen before are beating
outside another batch of motorcycles roar away kicking up more clouds of dust
then they gave me ten bucks put me on a bus and when i woke up here i was in downtown vegas and for a minute all i could think
was o jesus whos divorcing me this time
but then i remembered by god
i was here for the mint
and man i tell you its wonderful to be here
just wonderful to be here with you people
a magazine reporter lunges across the bar grabs the bartender
smacks the bar with his palm hell yes
bring us ten
screams ill back it
slides off his stool to the floor outside motorcycles roar away
the dust cloud billows into the tent getting denser
on the floor this is a magic moment in sport
it may never come again
i once did the triple crown but it was nothing like this
a frog eyed woman claws at the magazine reporter tries to haul him up
please stand up
youre a correspondent for a major national magazine whos name we cant get clearance for
youd be a very handsome man if youd just stand up
im damn near intolerably handsome down here where i am
youd go crazy if i stood up
a feverishly eager lacerda appears out of the dust cloud cameras slung round his neck
club soda please
to magazine reporter please
i love life
to duke man its great out there
meet you outside
lacerda downs his drink hurries out through the crowd and out into the cloud of dust
except for a thick cloud of dust
barely visible a motorcycle comes speeding into the pits
the rider staggers off his bike
the pit crew gas it up and sends it back with a fresh rider
duke watches him disappear back into the dust cloud
by they were spread out all over the course
it was no longer a race now it was an endurance contest
the idea of trying to cover this race in any conventional press sense was absurd
a horn honks
a shiny black bronco with driver
lacerda hangs out of the window
its great isnt it
duke gets into the bronco and they head into the dust cloud
duke hangs on with his beer
nothing all around but the huge impenetrable cloud of dust
lacerda snaps madly away at nothing at all
ill just keep trying different combos of film and lenses till i find one that works in this dust
the sound of motorcycles racing
we hear music and voices singing
as we go marching on when i reach my final campground in that land beyond the sun and the great commander asks me
what did he ask you rusty
did you fight or did you run
a moment later the bronco races out of the dust
duke coughs chokes drinks beer
continuing and what did you tell them rusty
we responded to their rifle fire with everything we had
the sound of gun shots
a dune buggy races toward them loaded down with three retired petty officers drunk as hell
the radio blares the dune buggy is covered with ominous symbols screaming eagles carrying american flags in their claws
a slant eyed snake being chopped to bits by a buzz saw made of stars and stripes
a machine gun mount on the passenger side
they yell over the roaring engines
wheres the damn race
were just good patriotic americans like yourself
duke gives dune buggy passenger a nice big grin
in response the passenger narrows his eyes tightens his grip on an automatic weapon
suspiciously what outfit you fellas with
the sporting press
the driver and dune buggy passenger exchange looks
if you want a good chase you should get after that skunk from cbs news up ahead in the black jeep
hes the man responsible for that book the selling of the pentagon
a black jeep you say
and they roar away
take me back to the pits
no no we have to go on
we need total coverage
duke gets out of the bronco
after a moments hesitation lacerda and the bronco driver roar away leaving duke alone in the cloud of dust
it was time
i felt for an agonizing reappraisal of the whole scene
the race was definitely under way
i had witnessed the start i was sure of that much
but what now
turn up the radio
turn up the tape machine
roll the windows down
lets taste this cool desert wind
this is what its all about
duke beer in hand drives a big smile for the world
gonzo scans the vegas visitor
total control now
tooling along the main drag on a saturday night in vegas two good old boys in a fire apple red convertible
stoned ripped twisted
how about nickel nicks slot arcade
hot slots that sounds heavy
twenty nine cent hotdogs
look what are we doing here
are we here to entertain ourselves or to do the job
to do the job of course
here we go
a crab louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars
the shark hits a bump
as your attorney i advise you to drive over to the tropicana and pick up on guy lombardo
hes in the blue room with his royal canadians
they hit another bump
cut to wide shot
they are driving around in circles in a large casino parking lot bumping over the dividers
why should i pay out my hard earned dollars to watch a fucking corpse
i dont know about you but in my line of business its important to be hep
what the hell are you doing
you cant park here
is this not a reasonable place to park
reveal the red shark parked on the sidewalk in front of the desert inn
two doormen loom over the car hood
the marquee says tonight
gonzo leaps from the car waving a five dollar bill at the we want this car parked
we drove all the way from l
for this show
were friends of debbies
a pause then
the doorman pockets the bill hands them a parking stub
duke and gonzo hurry into the hotel
duke and gonzo walk through the lobby
black mirrored sleek classy
they almost had us there
that was quick thinking
what do you expect
im your attorney
you owe me five bucks
i want it now
duke shrugs and hands over the
this was bob hopes turf
it seemed inappropriate to be haggling about nickel dime bribes for the parking lot attendant
a wine colored tuxedo stops them at the entrance to the ballroom
sorry full house
goddamnit we drove all the way from l
i said there are no seats left
at any price
were old friends of debbies
i used to romp with her
gonzo and the wine colored tuxedo get into an ugly arm waving negotiation
after a lot of bad noise he let us in for nothing provided we would stand quietly at the back and not smoke
as duke and gonzo disappear through the door we can hear the orchestra blasting out a highly blandized sgt
peppers a beat
the door flies open and bouncers manhandle duke and gonzo out
despite the rough treatment theyre both screeching jesus creeping shit
tears streaming did the mescaline just kick in
or was that debbie reynolds in a silver afro wig
in hysteria we wandered into a fucking time capsule
duke drives fast into the night
theyre both laughing in hysteria we wandered into a fucking time capsule
gonzo finds a tiny tear in his jacket
gonzo is instantly morose
gonzo twists round in the car screams back into the night
i know where you live
ill find you and burn down your fucking house
a hundred foot high neon clown bazooko circus
the red shark pulls up beneath the sign
this is the place
theyll never fuck with us here
wheres the ether
this mescaline isnt working
into the glaring chasing lights of the entrance canopy steps duke in ec u holding a kleenex soaked in ether to his
ah devil ether
it makes you behave like the village drunkard in some early irish novel
total loss of all basic motor skills blurred vision no balance numb tongue throws away kleenex the mind recoils in horror unable to communicate with the spinal column
which is interesting because you can actually watch yourself behaving in this terrible way but you cant control it
duke and gonzo approach the entrance with elaborate care taking one step at a time trying to keep ahead of the drug
you approach the turnstiles and know that when you get there you have to give the man two dollars or he wont let you inside
but when you get there everything goes wrong
duke and gonzo bounce off the walls crash into old ladies giggle helplessly as they try to pay hands flapping crazily unable to get money out of their pockets
some angry rotarian shoves you and you think whats happening here
whats going on
then you hear yourself mumbling
mumbling dogs fucked the pope no fault of mine
my name is brinks i was born
get sheep over side
women and children to armored car
orders from captain zeep
the attendants indulgently escort them through the turnstiles
ether is the perfect drug for las vegas
in this town they love a drunk
so they put us through the turnstiles and turned us loose inside
flames shoot up from below the casino
above a high wire act with four muzzled wolverines six nymphet sisters from san diego two silver painted polack brothers and three the wolverine chases a nymphet through the air
two polacks swing at it from opposite sides and they are instantly locked in a death battle
all plummet to the nets suspended over the gambling tables and slot machines
no one looks up
the gamblers remain bazooko circus is what the whole hep world would be doing saturday night if the nazis had won the war
this was the sixth reich
something causes duke to look down
a dwarf carrying drinks on a tray is tugging dukes pants leg trying to get him to move out of the way
a drug person can learn to cope with things like seeing their dead grandmother crawling up their leg with a knife in her teeth but nobody should be asked to
handle this trip
gonzo and duke go upstairs walking past funhouse booths
one of them is manned by an orangutan in costume
a fairground barker grabs duke
stand in front of this fantastic machine my friend
for just cents your likeness will appear hundred feet tall on a screen above downtown las vegas
on a tv monitor a foot high drunkard looms over the las vegas skyline screaming obscenities
cents more for a voice message
say whatever you want fella
theyll hear you dont worry about that
remember youll be feet tall
step right up
shoot the pasties off the nipples of this ten foot bull dyke and win a cotton candy goat
duke and gonzo sit on the revolving platform
gonzo stares glassy eyed coming apart
i hate to say this but this place is getting to me
i think im getting the fear
we came here to find the american dream and now were right in the vortex you want to quit
you must realize that weve found the main nerve
thats what gives me the fear
look over there
two women fucking a polar bear
please dont tell me those things
signals the waitress for two wild turkeys this is my last drink
how much money can you lend me
i have to go
leave the country
youll be straight in a few hours
this is serious
one more hour in this town and ill kill somebody
ill lend you some money
lets go outside and see how much we have left
can we make it
that depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door
i want to leave fast
lets pay this bill and get up very slowly
its going to be a long walk
signals waitress who comes over suddenly to waitress do they pay you to screw that bear
hes just kidding
to gonzo come on doc lets go downstairs and gamble
gonzo trembles with fear walks to the edge of the turntable
when does this thing stop
it wont stop
its not ever going to stop
duke carefully steps off the turntable
gonzo eyes staring blindly ahead squiting in fear and confusion rooted to the spot is carried away
dont move youll come around
duke reaches out to grab gonzo who jumps back keeps going around
the bartender narrows his eyes at them
duke steps onto the merry go round hurries round the bar approaching gonzo from the blind side and shoves gonzo from behind
gonzo goes down with a hellish scream
duke approaches him with his hands in the air
gonzo refuses to move and stands tense fists clenched looking for somebody to hit
an old woman perhaps
you stay here and go to jail
duke walks fast towards the stairs
gonzo catches up with him
did you see that
some sonofabitch kicked me in the back
probably the bartender
he wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress
lets get out of here
wheres the elevator
turning him in the opposite direction dont go near that elevator
thats just what they want us to do
trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement
duke and gonzo stumble out of the entrance
theyd like any excuse to shoot us
in an extended fall you drive
i think theres something wrong with me
gonzo struggles with the key in the lock
those bastards have changed the lock on us
they probably searched the room
jesus were finished
the door suddenly swings open
duke and gonzo fall inside
use all chains
duke locks the door
the suite is crowded with room service goodies
duke turns to see gonzo staring at two hotel room keys
where did this one come from
duke snatches a key
thats lacerdas room
gonzo smiles a slow smile
i thought we might need it
gonzo snatches the key back
lets go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose
no we should leave the poor bastard alone
i get the feeling that hes avoiding us for some reason
dont kid yourself
that portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous
hes watching us like a hawk
he told me he was turning in early
gonzo utters an anguished cry slaps the wall with both hands
that dirty bastard
i knew it
hes got hold of my woman
laughing that little blonde groupie with the film crew
you think he sodomized her
thats right laugh about it
you goddamn honkies are all the same
gonzo slashes a grapefruit with a huge razor sharp hunting knife
whered you get that knife
room service sent it up
i wanted something to cut the limes
they didnt have any
they dont grow in the desert
that dirty toad bastard
i knew i should have taken him out when i had the chance
now he has her
duke watches straight faced
i remember the girl
wed had a problem with her in the elevator a few hours earlier my attention had made a fool of himself
an elevator door opens to reveal the smiling faces of duke and gonzo stagger in
lacerda drops his smile
hes standing beside the blonde tv reporter
a trembling gonzo moonily turns his eyes onto her
to gonzo you must be a rider
what class are you in
what the fuck do you mean
what do you ride
were filming the race for a tv series maybe we can use you
mother of god i thought
here it comes
gonzo is trembling badly
theres a moment of uncomfortable silence
suddenly shouting i ride the big ones
the really big fuckers
gonzo shows his teeth to lacerda
duke laughs trying to defuse the scene
the vincent black shadow
were with the factory team
gonzo stills becomes dangerous zeros in on the tv cameraman groin to groin
wait a minute pardon me lady but i think theres some kind of ignorant chicken sucker in this car who needs his face cut open
you cheap honky faggots
which one of you wants to get cut
the elevator door opens but nobody moves
the door closes
the door opens again
a middle aged couple start to get in
change their minds
the door closes
duke and gonzo run down the corridor
gonzo laughs wildly
they were spooked
like rats in a death cage
duke and gonzo crash into their hotel suite bolt the door
gonzo stops laughing
its serious now
that girl understood
she fell in love with me
gonzo with the big hunting knife sliced grapefruit segments everywhere
lets go up there and castrate that fucker
gonzo pauses a mad thought turns to duke
squinting suspiciously have you made a deal with him
did you put him on to her
backing slowly towards the door look you better put that blade away and get your head straight
i have to put the car in the lot
one of the things you learn after years of dealing with drug people is that you can turn your back on a person but never turn your back on a
especially when its waving a razor sharp hunting knife in your eyes
the magazine reporter is on the telephone
las vegas at dawn
the racers are still asleep the dust is still on the desert fifty thousand dollars in prize money slumbers darkly in the office safe at del webbs fabulous mint hotel
duke walks past the reporter into the casino the sad meagre crowds around the crap tables
who are these people
where do they come from
they look like caricatures of used car dealers from dallas
and sweet jesus there are a hell of a lot of them at four thirty on a monday morning
still humping the american dream that vision of the big winner somehow emerging from the last minute predawn chaos of a stale vegas casino
duke stops at the money wheel puts down a two dollar bill on a number the wheel turns he loses
learn to enjoy losing
duke walks back into the room
we hear the loud strains of he walks to the bathroom and opens the door
submerged in green water gonzo wallows in the steaming tub
soap labels and grapefruit rinds float on the surface
a large empty pack of neutrogena soap lies on the floor
the shower is on the tub overflowing
the tape recorder plays from where its plugged into the razor socket over the sink
duke turns off the shower notices a huge hunk of chewed you ate all this acid
turning down the volume you evil son of a bitch
you better hope theres some thorazine in that bag because if theres not youre in bad trouble
turn it up
put that tape on
i want a rising sound
im leaving here in two hours and then theyre going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps
right there in that tub
i dig my own graves
green water and the white rabbit
put it on
but do me one last favor will you
can you give me two hours
thats all i ask just two hours to sleep before tomorrow
i suspect its going to be a very difficult day
he switches on the tape
white rabbit begins to build
coolly of course im your attorney ill give you all the time you need at my normal rates an hour but youll be wanting a cushion so why dont you
just lay one of those bills down there beside the radio and fuck off
how about a check
duke moves the radio as far from the tub as he can and leaves closing the door behind him
duke goes across to the sofa and crashes exhausted
suddenly a great ripping and crashing noise in the bathroom
i need help
duke jumps up crosses to the bathroom door muttering
shit hes killing himself
duke rushes in
gonzo flails trying to reach the radio with the shower curtain pole which he has ripped from its mounts
snarling i want that fucking radio
dont touch it
get back in that tub
back the tape up
i need it again
let it roll
just as high as the fucker can go
and when it comes to that fantastic note where the rabbit bites its own head off i want you to throw that fucking duke stares down at gonzo
it would blast you through the wall stone dead in ten seconds and theyd make me explain it
dont make me use this
i want to get higher
duke considers this
hes had enough
this is probably the only solution
holds the plugged in tape radio over the tub let me make sure i have it all lined up
you want me to throw this thing into the tub when white rabbit peaks
is that it
gonzo falls back into the water smiling gratefully
i was beginning to think i was going to have to go out and get one of the goddamn maids to do it
are you ready
he switches white rabbit back on
gonzo howls and moans and thrashes to the music straining to get over the top
meanwhile duke picks up a grapefruit from the sink a good two pounder he gets a grip on it
and when white rabbit peaks
he hurls it into the tub like a cannonball
duke slumps onto the sofa
gonzo rips open the bathroom door his eyes unfocused
he waves the razor sharp blade out in front of him lunges at gonzo stops hisses
youd do that wouldnt you
laughs why worry
youll like it
nothing in the world like a mace high
forty five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves
you cheap honky sonofabitch
hell just a minute ago you were asking me to kill you
and now you want to kill me
what i should do goddamnit is call the police
theres no choice
i wouldnt dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife
mumbles who said anything about slicing you up
i just wanted to carve a little z on your forehead
gonzo shrugs and reaches for a cigarette on top of the tv set
menaces him with the mace get back in that tub
eat some reds and try to calm down
smoke some grass shoot some smack shit do whatever you have to do but let me get some rest
gonzo turns toward the bathroom suddenly sad
you really need some sleep
you have to work
what a bummer
try to rest
dont let me keep you up
gonzo shuffles back into the bathroom
duke wedges a chair up against the bathroom doorknob and puts the mace can next to the clock
duke turns on the tv
white noise fills the room
he collapses onto the sofa and lights up his lightbulb as pipe
ignore the nightmare in the bathroom
just another ugly refugee from the love generation
the white noise snow storm on the tv is reflected in his face
the camera pulls back revealing the entire wall my attorney had never been able to accept the notion often espoused by former drug abusers that you can get a lot
higher without drugs than with them
and neither have i for that matter
the pattern on the wall changes to a s viscous oil lightshow pattern
with duke still sitting in the foreground the projected image widens to reveal the interior of a haight ashbury dance hall full of dancing proto hippies
a slightly younger duke moves through the throng
all the action is in a dreamlike slow motion
i recall one night in the matrix
there i was a victim of the drug explosion
a natural street freak just eating whatever came by
a road person with a big pack on his back is shouting
the sound of his voice like his movements is in slow motion
anybody want some l
i got all the makins right here
all i need is a place to cook
the camera pushes right into the road persons mouth
still in slow motion the younger duke is trying to eat a huge spansule of acid
i decided to eat only half at first
but i spilled the rest on the sleeve of my red pendleton shirt
duke stares at his sleeve uncertain what to do
c u of the door to the mens room as a musician enters speaking in slow motion
whats the trouble
also in slow motion well all this white stuff on my sleeve is lsd
the musician approaches and looks down at dukes arm
a long pause
cut back to tight shot of door as it opens and a very clean cut preppy stockbroker type enters
he freezes in horror
we cut to his pov
duke is standing in the middle of the mens room with the musician hunkered down at his side
sucking on his sleeve
a very gross tableau
the stockbroker slowly eases out of the room
with a bit of luck his life was ruined forever thinking that just behind some narrow door in all his favorite bars men in red pendleton shirts are getting incredible
kicks from things hell never know
the stockbroker looking considerably older sits looking lost confused a nervous wreck
the image flares out in a tv white noise snowstorm
duke sits staring at the tv
strange memories on this nervous night in las vegas
he gets up pours himself a drink has it been five years
it seems like a lifetime the kind of peak that never comes again
san francisco in the middle sixties was a very special time and place to be a part of
but no explanation no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time and the
whatever it meant
duke throws open the curtains
light streams in
we are in san francisco
images of the time flood in
we had all the momentum we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave
so now less than five years later you can go up on a steep hill in las vegas and look west and with the right kind of eyes you can
almost see the high water mark that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back
the memories dissolve into the night skyline of vegas
suddenly towering over the casinos is a foot high nazi shouting woodstock uber alles
duke closes the curtain
the room is in darkness again
a harsh door buzzer
duke jerks awake
looking like shit
around him is the wreckage of their stay
the decision to flee came suddenly
or maybe not
duke opens the door to a bell boy with a trolley load of fruit drinks and flowers
and a smile
the bell boy wheels the trolley across the room already stacked with even more boxes of goodies
maybe id planned it all along subconsciously waiting for the right moment
the bill was a factor i think
because i had no money to pay for it
duke slams the door starts frantically packing
our room service tabs had been running somewhere between and per hour for forty eight consecutive hours
how could it happen
duke sees the discarded wrappings of expensive hand tooled luggage
a sudden thought
he rushes to gonzos room empty
his plastic briefcase remains on the bed
but by the time i asked this question there was no one around to answer
duke opens the briefcase finds the
my attorney was gone
he must have sensed trouble
gonzo waves goodbye as he boards an airplane with a set of brand new fine cowhide luggage
duke emerges with his bag and gonzos plastic briefcase leaves the do not disturb sign on the door checks both ways then hurries away down the corridor
it crept up my spine like first rising vibes of an acid frenzy
all these horrible realities began to dawn on me
an anxiety ridden duke watches the floor numbers as the elevator descends
he searches his pockets
here i was alone in las vegas with this goddamned incredibly expensive car completely twisted on drugs no cash no story for the magazine
and on top of everything else i had a gigantic goddamn hotel bill to deal with
duke finds a last crumpled bill
the door opens
a security guard enters with an old lady in duke hides the bill crams back into the corner
i didnt even know who had won the race
duke hurries out of the elevator eyes on a hovering manager
past the curious look of the reception clerk
muttering to himself how would horatio alger have handled this situation
motoring duke gives his bill to the hotel front doorman with a smile
the doorman blows a frantic whistle and waves at the car boy
im a relatively respectable citizen a multiple felon perhaps but certainly not dangerous
the car boy pulls up with a screech
duke jumps in
the back seat is stacked with bars of neutrogena piles of mint t shirts boxes of grapefruit
luckily i had taken the soap and grapefruit and other luggage out to the car a few hours earlier
now it was only a matter of slipping the noose
duke shifts into drive
weve been looking for you
the game was up
they had me
to himself well why not
many fine books have been written in prison
resigned duke turns off the ignition
a young clerk arrives breathlessly with a smile and a yellow letter in his sir
thrusts out a telegram this telegram came for you
actually it isnt for you
its for somebody named thompson but it says care of raoul duke
does that make sense
barely able to speak yes
it makes sense
duke stuffs the telegram into his top pocket
the clerk peers into the car sees part of the enormous stash inside
i checked the register for this man thompson
we dont show him but i figured he might be part of your team
dont worry ill get it to him
he fires up the engine eases the red shark into low gear
security guards are looking across sharing a quiet word or two
what confused us was dr
gonzos signature on the telegram from los angeles
when we knew he was right here in the hotel
you did the right thing
never try to understand a press message
about half the time we use codes especially with dr
when will the doctor be awake
what do you mean
dukes eyes are on the security guards moving closer
the manager mr
heem would like to meet him
heem likes to meet all our large accounts
put them on a personal basis
just a chat and a handshake you understand
but if i were you id leave the doctor alone until after hes eaten breakfast
hes a very crude man
duke edges the car forward but is stopped by the clerk
but he will be available
perhaps later this morning
that telegram was all scrambled
it was actually from thompson not to him
western union must have gotten the names reversed
i have to get going
i have to get out to the track
theres no hurry
the race is over
taking off not for me
he waves the clerk off the car roars away
lets have lunch
duke drives the red shark out of vegas
a you are leaving las vegas sign flashes past
bob dylan plays memphis blues again aaww mama can this really by the end
a sign los angeles miles
jesus bad waves of paranoia madness fear and loathing intolerable vibrations in this place
the weasels were closing in
i could smell the ugly brutes
duke drives fast
do me one last favor lord just give me five more high speed hours before you bring the hammer down just let me get rid of this goddamn car and
off of this horrible desert
a sign flashes you can run but you cant hide
a patrol car pulls out behind him lights flashing
you evil bastard
this is your work
youd better take care of me lord
because if you dont youre going to have me on your hands
the patrol car screams after the red shark
few people understand the psychology of dealing with a highway traffic cop
your normal speeder will panic and immediately pull over to the side
this is wrong
duke floors the gas pedal
it arouses contempt in the cop heart
make the bastard chase you
he will follow
but he wont know what to make of your blinker signal that says youre about to turn right
duke signals right
the red shark screams at mph
this is to let him know youre looking for a proper place to pull off and talk
duke hits the brakes
the cop brakes
it will take him a moment to realize that he is about to make degree turn at speed
but you will be ready for it braced for the gs and the fast heel toe work
the patrol car spins and fishtails crazily out of control
the patrol car comes skidding around the corner
duke stands beside the red shark completely relaxed and smiling
the highway patrolman gets out of the car screaming
just what the fuck did you think you were doing
may i see your license
of course officer
duke reaches for it
and both men look down at a beer can which duke had somehow forgotten was in his hand
i knew i was fucked
the cop relaxes actually smiles
he reaches out for dukes wallet then holds out his other hand for the beer
could i have that please
it was getting warm anyway
the highway patrolman takes it pours out the beer glances in the back seat of the red shark
amongst the bars of soap
a case of warm beer
duke smiles back at him
i understand that
i knew it was a crime but i did it anyway
shit why argue
im a fucking criminal
thats a strange attitude
he looks at duke thoughtfully
you know i get the feeling you could use a nap
theres a rest area up ahead
why dont you pull over and sleep a few hours
a nap wont help
ive been awake for too long three or four nights
i cant even remember
if i go to sleep now im dead for twenty hours
the highway patrolman smiles
heres how it is
what goes into my book as of noon is that i apprehended you
for driving too fast and advised you to proceed no further than the next rest area
your stated destination right
where you plan to take a long nap
do i make myself clear
how far is baker
i was hoping to stop there for lunch
not my jurisdiction
the city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area
can you make it that far
ive been wanting to go to baker for a long time
ive heard a lot about it
the patrolman holds the door for duke who gets in
with a mind like yours youll probably want to try the land crab
try the majestic diner
the patrolman slams the door shut
duke drives away teeth gritted
i felt raped
the pig had done me on all fronts and now he was going off to chuckle about it on the west side of town waiting for me to make a
run for l
duke drives past the rest area to an intersection where he signals to turn right into baker
as he approaches the turn he sees the hitchhiker
as duke slows to make the turn their eyes meet
duke is about to wave but the hitchhiker drops his thumb
great jesus its him
duke spooked spins the red shark round roars back the duke on the public phone booth screaming
theyve nailed me
im trapped in some stinking desert crossroads called baker
i dont have much time
the fuckers are closing in
theyll hunt me down like a beast
gonzo sits surrounded by legal papers and law books
mexican day of the dead masks hang from the walls flame red demons
you sound a little paranoid
duke screams sweat pouring
i need a lawyer immediately
what are you doing in baker
didnt you get my telegram
im in trouble
you worthless bastard
ill cripple your ass for this
all that shit in the car is yours
you understand that
when i finish testifying out here youll be disbarred
youre supposed to be in vegas
we have a suite at the flamingo
i was just about to leave for the airport
duke pulls out the telegram from his top pocket
you brainless scumbag
youre supposed to be covering the national district attorneys conference
i made all the reservations
rented a white cadillac convertible
the whole thing is arranged
what the hell are you doing out there in the middle of the fucking desert
duke stares at the telegram
its all a big joke
im actually sitting beside the pool at the flamingo
im talking from a portable phone
some dwarf brought it out from the casino
i have total credit
can you grasp that
shouts dont come anywhere near this place
foreigners arent welcome here
duke breathing heavily hangs up phone
c u of
magnum cylinder being spun
this is how the world works
c u an iguana basks in the sun
all energy flows according to the whims of the great magnet
c u barrel of the gun
an explosion of desert dirt
what a fool i was to defy him
the iguana sits unfazed
never cross the great magnet
i understood this now
another blast from the gun and with understanding came a sense of almost terminal relief
duke stands alone in the vast desert firing at nothing the thuds of the explosions echo away
the red shark driving back towards las vegas
i had to get rid of the shark
too many people might recognize it
especially the vegas police
tight c u of duke luckily my credit card was still technically valid
duke now driving a white cadillac coupe de ville the duke pushes buttons lowers the top
this was a superior machine ten grand worth of gimmicks and high price special effects
the rear windows leapt up with a touch like frogs in a dynamited pond
the dashboard was full of esoteric lights and dials and meters that i would never understand
if the pigs were gathering in vegas i felt the drug culture should be represented as well
and there was a certain bent appeal in the notion of running a savage burn on one las vegas hotel and then just wheeling across town and checking into another
the white whale turns into a vip parking slot immediately attended by impressed minions
me and a thousand ranking cops from all over america
move confidently into their midst
duke enters old levis grubby sneakers peso acapulco shirt coming apart at the seams day growth eyes hidden behind mirror shades
he heads for the check in line
my arrival was badly timed
the place is full of cops
of them on vacation all dressed in cut price vegas casuals plaid bermuda shorts arnie palmer golf shirts and rubberized beach sandals
ahead of duke a police chief argues with the desk clerk
the police chiefs agnew style wife stands to the side weeping
the police chiefs friends stand uneasily around
what do you mean im too late to register
im a police chief
look fella i told you
waves a postcard i have a postcard here that says i have reservations in this hotel
prissily im sorry sir
youre on the late list
your reservations were transferred to the
moonlight motel which is out on paradise boulevard
ive already paid for my goddamn room
its actually a very fine place of lodging and only sixteen blocks from here with its own pool and
you dirty little faggot
call the manager
im tired of listening to this dogshit
friends restrain the police chief
solicitously im so sorry sir
may i call you a cab
the police chiefs screamed insults fade away
of course i could hear what the clerk was really saying
listen you fuzzy little shithead ive been fucked around in my time by a fairly good cross section of mean tempered rule crazy cops and now its my turn
fuck you officer im in charge here and im telling you we dont have room for you
duke steps to the desk around the raging police chief
i hate to interrupt but i wonder if maybe i could just sort of slide through and get out of your way
names raoul duke raoul duke
my attorney made the reservation
duke snaps a credit card down onto the counter
everyone goes silent
the police chief group stares at him like he was some kid of water rat crawling up to the desk
the clerk hits the bell for the bellboy
my bags are out there in that white cadillac convertible
can you have someone drive it around to the room
all eyes turn to the gleaming white whale
oh and could i get a quart of wild turkey two fifths of baccardi and a nights worth of ice delivered to my room please
dont worry about a thing sir
just enjoy your stay
well thank you
duke gives the police chief a polite smile crosses to the elevator turns to face the gawping cops pops a can of beer and toasts them
the doors close
duke rams the key home swings the door open
ah home at last
the door hits something with a thud
a year old girl with the aura of an angry pit bull
gonzo stands in the bathroom doorway stark naked with a drug addled grin on his face
you degenerate pig
it cant be helped
this is lucy
laughing distractedly you know like lucy in the sky with diamonds
lucy eyes duke venomously
lucy be cool goddamnit
remember what happened at the airport
no more of that okay
lucy keeps her eyes on duke
gonzo idles over and puts his arm round her shoulder
this is my client
this is mr
duke the famous journalist
hes paying for this suite lucy
hes on our side
duke flops onto the sofa
duke is my friend
he loves artists
duke notices for the first time that the room is full of artwork
maybe or portraits some in oil some in charcoal all more or less the same size and same face
lucy paints portraits of barbra streisand
i drew these from tv
she came all the way down here from montana just to give these portraits to barbra
were going over to the americana hotel tonight to meet her backstage
dukes voice rises above gonzo
i desperately needed peace rest sanctuary
i hadnt counted on this
finding my attorney on acid and locked into some kind of preternatural courtship
well i guess they brought the car round by now
lets get the stuff duke fixes gonzo hard
absolutely lets get the stuff
to lucy now well be right back
dont answer the phone if it rings
makes one fingered jesus freak sign god bless
duke collars gonzo serious
what are your plans
struggling to focus shit
i met her on the plane and i had all that acid
he shrugs you know those little blue barrels
i gave her a cap before i realized
shes a religious freak
jesus shes never even had a drink
itll probably work out
we can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention
gonzo stares uneasily at duke
listen shes running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months
shes perfect for this gig
these cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her
we can set her up in one of these back street motels hang pictures of jesus all over the room then turn these pigs loose on her
hell shes strong shell hold her own
gonzos face twitches badly
i knew you were sick but i never expected to hear you actually say that kind of stuff
its straight economics
this girl is a god send
shit she can make us a grand a day
stop talking like that
i figure she can do about four at a time
christ if we keep her full of acid thats more like two grand a day
you filthy bastard
i should cave your fucking head in
in a few hours shell probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering jesus based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel
samoan who fed her liquor and lsd dragged her to a vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing uncircumcised member
gonzo starts crying
i felt sorry for the girl i wanted to help her
youll go straight to the gas chamber
and even if you manage to beat that theyll send you back to nevada for rape and consensual sodomy
shes got to go
shit it doesnt pay to try to help somebody these days
the only alternative was to take her out to the desert and feed her remains to the lizards
but it seemed a bit heavy for the thing we were trying to protect my attorney
we have to cut her loose
shes got two hundred dollars
and we can always call the cops up there in montana where she lives and turn her in
what kind of goddamn monster are you
it just occurred to me that she has no witnesses
anything that she says about us is completely worthless
duke is speaking into the phone in hushed tones
i need a reservation
for my niece
listen i need her treated very gently
shes an artist and might seem a trifle highstrung
in the background gonzo helps lucy and her paintings out the door
okay lucy its time to go meet barbra
i felt like a nazi but it had to be done
the white whale pulls up duke at the wheel
gonzo helps lucy and her paintings from the car
lucy was a potentially fatal millstone on both our necks
there was absolutely no choice but to cut her adrift and hope her memory was fucked
gonzo unrolls a couple of bills pays off a cab driver waves to lucy in the back with her paintings
shes starting to come down
gonzo gets back in the white whale and slaps his hands together as if washing his hands of the situation
well thats that
take off slowly
dont attract attention
they pull out into traffic
i gave the cabbie an extra ten bucks to make sure she gets there safe
also i told him id be there myself in an hour and if she wasnt id come back out here and rip his lungs out
you cant be subtle in this town
as your attorney i advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline
maybe we should take it easy tonight
lets find a good seafood restaurant and eat some red salmon
i feel a powerful lust for red salmon
the electric white whale heads off down the strip
the suns going down behind the scrub hills a good kristofferson tune croaks on the radio in the warm dusk
gonzo throws up in the toilet bowl
in the background duke opens curtains
daylight blinds him
come on were going to be late
gonzo looks up at his sick reflection wipes his mouth with a towel
this goddamn mescaline
why the fuck cant they make it a little less pure
maybe mix it up with rolaids or something
crackling and booming over the lousy sound system on behalf of the prosecuting attorneys of this county i welcome you to the third national das conference on narcotics and dangerous
the executive director well groomed gop businessman type speaks from the podium
a banner behind him reads national das convention
if you dont know come to learn
if you know come to teach
and other twilight types beards mustaches and super mod dress
just because youre a cop doesnt mean you cant be with it
however for every urban hipster there are around a dozen big low fidelity speakers mounted on steel poles distort and feed back the executives voice through the room
at the back under a loudspeaker sits duke fbi wingtips a pat boone madras sportcoat and an official name tag raoul duke private investigator l
gonzo sits beside him
his name tag dr
expert criminal drug analysis
hes nervous close to the edge
lowers his voice i saw these bastards in easy rider but i didnt believe they were real
not like this
not hundreds of them
theyre actually nice people when you get to know them
man i know these people in my goddamn blood
dont mention that word around here
youll get them excited
this is a fucking nightmare
sure as hell some dope dealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that youre partying with a thousand cops
blumquist a drug expert takes the stage
we must come to terms with the drug culture in the country
the sound systems echoes
the reefer butt is called a roach because it resembles a cockroach
whispers what the fuck are these people talking about
youd have to be crazy on acid to think a joint looked like a goddamn cockroach
it was clear that we had stumbled into a prehistoric gathering
now there are four states of being in the cannabis or marijuana society cool groovy hip and square
the square is seldom if ever cool
he is not with it that is he doesnt know whats happening
but if he manages to figure it out he moves up a notch to hip
duke and gonzo listen in disbelief
and if he can bring himself to approve of what is happening he becomes groovy
after that with much luck and perseverance he can rise to the rank of cool
a cool guy
bloomquist do you think the anthropologist margaret meads strange behavior of late might possibly be explained by a private marijuana addiction
i really dont know but at her age if she did smoke grass shed have one hell of a trip
roars of laughter
i know a hell of a lot better ways to waste my time than listening to this bullshit
he stands knocking the ashtray off his chair arm and plunges down the aisle to the door
down in front
i have to get out
i dont belong here
he stumbles from the room
duke turns his attention back to the stage
the lights go down
a black white film reefer madness
illustrates his now evangelical talk
may depend on it
you will not be able to see his eyes because of tea shades but his knuckles will be white from inner tension
duke turns his attention to a pound texan police chief who necks with his pound wife beside him
and his pants will be crusted with semen from constantly jacking off when he cant find a rape victim
duke gazes at the texan and his wife
feigning sickness he gets up hand over mouth
pardon me i feel sick
he will stagger and babble when questioned
he will not respect your badge
the dope fiend fears nothing
he will attack for no reason with every weapon at his command including yours
duke heads for the exit
any officer apprehending a suspected marijuana addict should use all necessary force immediately
one stitch in time on him will usually save nine on you
duke sees gonzo at the bar talking to a sporty looking cop about whose name tag identifies him as a district im a whiskey man myself
we dont have much trouble from drugs where i come from
one of these nights youll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart
theyll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big bowie knives
they might even sit on your wifes chest
put the blade right down on her throat
not down in my parts
duke joins them
to waitress rum and ice please
looks at dukes name tag youre another one of these california boys
your friend heres been tellin us about dope fiends
and sure as hell not in the south
they like warm weather
youd never believe it
its out of control
first it was drugs now its witchcraft
shit you cant mean it
the bartender cleans his glasses one ear straining for the conversation
read the newspapers
man you dont know trouble until you have to face down a bunch of these addicts gone crazy for human sacrifice
thats science fiction stuff
not where we operate
hell in malibu alone these goddamn satan worshippers kill six or eight people every day
all they want is the blood
theyll take people right off the street if they have to
just the other day we had a case where they grabbed a girl right out of a mcdonalds hamburger stand
she was a waitress about sixteen years old
with a lot of people watching too
the bartender keeps cleaning the same glass more and more furiously
what did they do to her
jesus christ man
they chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot
then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood
da ad libs a summation of the crime and nobody did anything
what could they do
the guy that took the head was about six seven and maybe three hundred pounds
he was packing two lugers and the others had m s
they just ran back out into death valley you know where manson turned up
like big lizards
and every one of them stacked naked
except for the weapons
they were all veterans
agog with the horrors of the story the bartender polishes the glass faster and faster
the big guy used to be a major in the marines
we know where he lives but we cant get near the house
not a major
he wanted the pineal gland
thats how he got so big
when he quit the marines he was just a little guy
usually its whole families
during the night
most of them dont even wake up until they feel their heads going and then of course its too late
the glass smashes in the bartenders hand
happens every day
duke turns to a waitress with a warm smile
three more rums
plenty of ice
maybe a handful of lime chunks
are you guys with the police convention upstairs
we sure are miss
i thought so
i never heard that kind of talk around here before
how do you guys stand that kind of work
grinning we like it
the waitress stares sickened at gonzo
whats wrong with you
hell somebody has to do it
hurry up with those drinks
only two rums
make mine a bloody mary
whacks his fist on the bar hell i really hate to hear this
because everything that happens in california seems to get down our way sooner or later
but that was back when the goddamn bastards were peaceful
all we had to do was to keep em under surveillance
they didnt roam around much
but now jesus it seems nobodys safe
with a conspiratorial nod youre going to need to take the bull by the horns go to the mat with this scum
what do you mean by that
you know what i mean
weve done it before and we can damn well do it again
cut their goddamn heads off
every one of them
thats what were doing in california
its all on the q
but everybody who matters is with us all the way down the line
we keep it quiet
its not the kind of thing youd want to talk about upstairs
not with the press around
recovering slightly hell no
wed never hear the goddamn end of it
dobermans dont talk
sometimes its easier to just rip out the backstraps
theyll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs
muttering in a daze i dont think i should tell my wife about this
shed never understand
you know how women are
duke gives the da a brotherly slap on the back
just be thankful your heart is young and strong
duke and gonzo leave the stunned da staring into the swirling ice in drink
duke and gonzo fall into the suite in fits of laughter
gonzo feels the nausea rise suddenly heads for the bathroom
immediate sounds of retching
the phone message light is blinking
duke opens a beer picks up the phone
whats the message
my light is blinking
you have one message call lucy at the americana hotel room
duke slams the phone down
gonzo emerges from the bathroom looking like death
gonzo sags visibly like an animal taking a bullet
the telephone rings
a worried clerk speaks in to the phone
duke im sorry we were cut off a moment ago
i thought i should call again because i was wondering
hand over the phone what was that crazy bitch said to him
screams theres a war on man
people are being killed
this terrible war
when will it end
what do you want
in the background gonzo is upturning a sofa to retrieve his stash from the lining
the woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed
i think she was crying
why was she crying
she didnt say mr
but since i know youre here with the police convention
look you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again
were watching her very carefully
this woman has been into laudanum
its a controlled experiment but i suspect well need your cooperation before this thing is over
hesitantly well certainly
were always happy to cooperate with the police
just treat this poor woman like youd treat any other human being in trouble
yes yes i see what you mean
so youll be responsible then
and now i have to get back to the news
send up some ice
he hangs up
gonzo zaps tv channels commercials
theyll treat us like goddamn lepers after that
slowly carefully lucy is looking for you
laughing no shes looking for you
she really flipped over you
the only way i could get rid of her was by saying you were taking me out to the desert for a showdown that you wanted me out of the
way so you could have her all to yourself
laughing again i guess she figures you won
that phone message wasnt for me was it
a look of stunned realization from duke
lucy is on the witness stand
yessir those two men in the dock are the ones who gave me the lsd and took me to the hotel
a doomed duke and gonzo await their fate
i dont know for sure what they done to me but i remember it was horrible
and double castration
the judge bangs his gavel
duke is madly stuffing his suitcase
you cant leave me alone in this snake pit
this room is in my name
duke keeps packing
gonzo is looking worried
ill call her
ill get her off our backs
shes my problem
its gone too far
let me handle this
dials the phone snaps angrily at duke youd make a piss poor lawyer
to duke as your attorney i advise you not to worry
nods towards bathroom take a hit out of that little brown bottle in my shaving kit
duke goes in the bathroom
he finds a little bottle a label drink me
what is this
you wont need much
just a little tiny taste that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger beer
duke stares wonderingly at the bottle
into phone hi lucy
yeah its me
i got your message
hell no i taught the bastard a lesson hell never forget
no not dead but he wont be bothering anybody for a while
i left him out there i stomped him then pulled all his teeth out
i remember thinking jesus what a terrible thing to lay on somebody with a head full of acid
duke dips a match head into the brown bottle studies it tastes it nothing tastes some more
to phone but heres the problem
that bastard cashed a bad check downstairs and gave you as a reference
theyll be looking for both of you
yeah i know but you cant judge a book by its cover lucy
some people are just basically rotten
anyway the last thing you want to do is call this hotel again theyll trace the call and put you straight behind bars
no im moving to the tropicana right away
i have to go theyve got the phone tapped
yeah i know it was horrible but its all over now
oh my god
throws the phone down shouts no
get away from me
it was duke
i swear to god
stomps the phone moans no i dont know where she is
youll never catch lucy
i swear i dont know where she is
dont put that thing on me
slams the phone down gonzo sits back in his chair
watching mission impossible
shes probably stuffing herself down the incinerator about now
thats the last we should be hearing from lucy
fumbling with the hash pipe wheres the opium
duke stares at the back of gonzos neck
something very i remember slumping on the bed his performance had given me a bad jolt
for a moment i thought his mind had snapped that he actually believed he was being attacked by invisible enemies
but the room was quiet again
whered you get this
never mind its absolutely pure
what kind of monster client have you picked up this time
theres only one source for this stuff the adrenaline gland from a living human body
gonzo turns to smile at duke
i know but the guy didnt have any cash to pay me
hes one of these satanism freaks
he offered me human blood said it would take me higher than ive ever been in my life
laughs struts round duke eyes bright with expectation i thought he was kidding so i told him id just as soon have an ounce or so of pure adrenochrome or
maybe just a fresh adrenaline gland to chew on
i could already feel the stuff working on me the first wave felt like a combination of mescaline and methedrine maybe i should take a swim i thought
duke sees that gonzo is toying with his hunting knife
yeah they nailed this guy for child molesting
he swore he didnt do it
why should i fuck with children
theyre too small
christ werewolf is entitled to legal counsel
i didnt dare turn the creep down
he might have picked up a letter opener and gone after my pineal gland
we should get some of that
just eat a big handful and see what happens
some of what
spitting words extract of pineal
thats a good idea
one whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia
man your head would swell up like a watermelon youd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours
then youd notice about six huge hairy tits swelling up on your back
duke is now so wire that his hands are clawing uncontrollably at the bedspread jerking it right out from under him
his heels are dug into the mattress with both knees locked youd go blind
your body would turn to wax
theyd have to put you in a wheelbarrow and
gonzos voice fades away dukes frenzied gaze reveals
man ill try about anything but id never touch a pineal gland
finish the fucking story
what about the glands
gonzo a small smile on his lips backs away warily
towards the tv now a hundred feet away in the distance
jesus that stuff got right on top of you didnt it
veins stand out on dukes forehead
he is purplish red
over the top
too late he realizes he is near death
maybe you could just
shove me into the pool or something
gonzo shakes his head disgustedly
if i put you in the pool right now youd sink like a goddamn stone
you took too much
jesus look at your face youre about to explode
gonzo sits back down
watching the tv
dont try and fight it or youll get brain bubbles
youll just wither up and die
insanely somewhere nilsson plays put the lime in the coconut and mix em all up
what kind of rat bastard psychotic would play that song right now at this moment
duke opens his eyes and the hotel suite rushes in
he lies awkwardly twisted unable to move
he could have been there days months
when i came to the general back alley ambiance of the suite was so rotten so incredibly foul
how long had i been lying there
all these signs of violence
what had happened
duke moves his eyes taking in his surroundings like the sight of some disastrous zoological experiment involving whisky and gorillas
blue and red christmas tree lights replace lightbulbs used towels hanging everywhere pornographic pictures ripped out of a magazine are plastered on a shattered mirror
there was evidence in this room of excessive consumption of almost every type of drug known to civilized man since ad
duke manages to move stiffly gets to his bare feet hobbles round the trashed room like a newly risen ape
but what kind of addict would need all these coconut husks and crushed honeydew rinds
would the presence of junkies account for all these uneaten french fries
these puddles of glazed ketchup on the bureau
maybe so but then why all this booze
and these crude pornographic photos smeared with mustard that had dried to a hard yellow crust
duke peers into gonzos room his bed like a burned out rats nest blackened springs and wires
these were not the hoof prints of your normal god fearing junkie
it was too savage too aggressive
duke stares at the smashed mirror
grim memories and bad flashbacks
in the bathroom dukes unlaced boots crush broken glass in duke unzips and pisses
there in the toilet bowl is the something ugly had happened
i was sure of it
duke stares at the golden stream splashing on the gun
the sounds of vomiting come from a closet near the front door
duke looks into the room
he sees gonzos ass sticking out of the closet
he opens his mouth to speak when in the sleeping on the sofa
the ominous sound of a key turning in the room lock
a hellish scream wakes up the sleeping duke
he sees gonzo grappling naked with the maid gun to her head
gonzo is muffling her screams with an ice bag
im only the maid
i didnt mean nothin
jumps up from the bed flashing his press badge
to duke she must have used a pass key
i was polishing my shoes in the closet when i noticed her sneaking in so i took her
duke shakes his head
barks at the maid what made you do it
who paid you off
im the maid
you were after the evidence
who put you up to this the manager
i dont know what youre talking about
youre just as much a part of it as they are
part of what
the dope ring
you must know whats going on in this hotel
why do you think were here
blubbering i know youre cops but i thought you were just here for that convention
all i wanted to do was clean up the room
i dont know anything about dope
come on baby dont try to tell us you never heard of the grange gorman
i swear to jesus i never heard of that stuff
maybe shes telling the truth
maybe shes not part of it
i swear im not
long pause in that case maybe she can help
ill help you all you need
i hate dope
so do we lady
helping her up i think we should put her on the payroll
see what she comes up with
do you think you can handle it
one phone call every day
just tell us what youve seen
dont worry if it doesnt add up thats our problem
gonzo hustles the maid to the door
youd pay me for that
youre damn right
but the first time you say anything about this to anybody youll go straight to prison for the rest of your life
whats your name
just ring linen service and ask for alice
youll be contacted by inspector rock
hell be posing as a politician
inspector rock will pay you
a thousand dollars on the ninth of every month
id do just about anything for that
you and a lot of other people
the password is one hand washes the other
the minute you hear that you say i fear nothing
i fear nothing
she repeats the password several times while they listen to make sure she has it right
oh and dont bother to make up the room
that way we wont have to risk another of these little incidents will we
whatever you say gentlemen
i cant tell you how sorry i am about what happened
dont worry its all over now
thank god for the decent people
she smiles repeating to herself one hand washes the other as gonzo hangs the do not disturb sign and shuts the door
a grimy tape runs through a grunged up portable tape recorder
thank god for the decent people
duke sits in the middle of the wrecked suite with his mangled tape recorder in front of him
memories of that night are extremely hazy
duke fast forwards through the tape searching awwww mama
can this really
be the end
the white whale waits gleaming beautiful
there is a definite obligation when you boom around vegas in a white coupe de ville to maintain a certain style
duke and gonzo burst out of the supermarket riding a shopping basket loaded with coconuts grapefruit and tequila
they send defeated shoppers sprawling
the trolley collides into the white whale
shoppers gather at the supermarket entrance to watch baskets loaded with junk screaming kids and empty wallets
duke switches on the music jumping jack flash
he selects a coconut ceremonially balances it on the hood
gonzo pulls out a silver claw hammer
a sly look at the gathering crowd
then he smashes the hammer down on the coconut
a gasp from the surly shoppers
duke places another coconut
milk and white meat flies everywhere
is that your car
coconut fragments fly
any of you folks want the milk
were after the meat
this is honest coconut essence
look what youre doing to that car
fuck the car
they should make these things with a goddamn fm radio
this foreign made crap is sucking our dollar balance dry
someone should stop them
you poor fools dont understand do you
this car is the property of the world bank
that money goes to somebody should call the police
are you people crazy
gonzo confronts the crowd hammer in one hand a coconut in the other
you folks every heard of ole patrick henry
know what he said
silence the crowd uncomprehending of this stone degenerate
gonzo brings the hammer down on the hood
a gasp from the crowd
in samoa we love the constitution
the crowd move in
call the goddamn police
look what theyve done to that beautiful car
duke jumps in behind the wheel
this crowd is not rational
they cant relate to us
a final clang
gonzo jumps in
duke floors the accelerator screams at the crowd
you people voted for hubert humphrey
you killed jesus
they swerve round and through the crowd
the crowd broke ranks
nobody wants to be run over by a coupe de ville
you found the american dream
in this town
were sitting on the main nerve right now
duke and gonzo wearing a single black glove talk conspiratorially to a rd man
a placid orangutan in a bow tie sits next to him
the bar is revolving faster than
the manager told me a story about the owner of this place
about how he always wanted to run away and join the circus when he was a kid
well now the bastard has his own circus and a license to steal too
youre right hes the model
pure horatio alger
duke playing the tape
how much do you think hed take for the ape
duke fast forwards again searching
how did this happen
they beat the shit out of it
the tops completely jammed
the car rental agent wrestles with the trashed car
yeah somethings wrong with the motor
the generator lights been on red ever since i drove the thing into lake mead on a water test
the tapes gone too far
duke races the tape backwards
then sirens howl
wheres the ape
im ready to write a check
duke is standing in the middle of a semi destroyed bazooko circus revolving bar
mirrors are broken
people are recovering from some kind of battle
the bar spins madly
forget it he just attacked an old man
he took a bite out of the bartenders head
the cops took the ape away
whats the bail
i want that ape
ive already reserved two first class seats on the plane
there was every reason to believe that we had been heading for trouble that wed pushed our luck a bit far
gonzo screams abuse out of the window at a ford alongside the vomit streaked white whale
duke makes a superhuman hey there
you folks want to buy some heroin
in the ford two couples middle aged american faces frozen in shock stare straight ahead
gonzo leans out close to them
goddamnit im serious
i want to sell you some pure fucking smack
this is the real stuff
you wont get hooked
i just got back from vietnam
this is scag folks
the lights change
the ford bolts
duke keeps pace with them
jab it right in your fucking eyeballs
the man in the back seat suddenly loses control enraged lunges against the glass trying to get at gonzo
you dirty bastards
pull over and ill kill you
god damn you
the tapes runs you dirty bastards
an ugly squeal of brakes
shit he was trying to bite me
i shoulda maced the fucker
duke fast forwards the tape
the tape mangles the sounds ski to a halt
duke grabs the nearest tool uses it to hook out the tape then realizes
its gonzos razor sharp folding knife
a duke turns the knife over
theres a dried crimson spot on
remembering back door beauty
the mentality of las vegas is so grossly atavistic that a really massive crime often slips by unrecognized
the possibility of physical and mental collapse is very real
no sympathy for the devil keep that in mind
buy the ticket take the ride
shadowy figures beat up a man give him a good north vegas is where you go when youve fucked up once too often on the strip and when youre not
even welcome in the cut rate downtown places
pan to reveal a seedy diner the north star cafe in the background
through the window duke and gonzo sit at the counter
the north star coffee lounge seemed like a fairly safe haven from our storms
no hassles no talk
just a place to rest and regroup
i wasnt even hungry
gonzo stuffs a hamburger down paying no attention to the beating going on outside the window
duke reads a newspaper
there was nothing in the atmosphere of the north star to put me on my guard
to waitress two glasses of ice water with ice
the waitress brings the ice water
she looked like a burnt out caricature of jane russell
she was definitely in charge here
gonzo gulps down his glass of water and hands her a napkin
he did it very casually but i knew that our peace was about to be shattered
what was that
the waitress stands at the end of the counter with her back to them while she ponders the napkin
what is this
the waitress slams the napkin down on the counter
dont give me that bullshit
i know what it means
you goddamn fat pimp bastard
thats the name of a horse i used to own
whats wrong with you
i take a lot of shit in this place but i sure as hell dont have to take it off a
i thought whats happening
duke picks up the napkin
on it is printed in careful red letters back door beauty
the question mark was emphasized
screams pay your bill and get the hell out
you want me to call the cops
gonzos hand goes inside his shirt
he pulls out the razor gonzo keeps his eyes on the waitress
he walks about six feet down the aisle and lifts the receiver of the pay phone
he slices it off then brings the receiver back to his stool and sits down
i was stupid with shock not knowing whether to run or start laughing
casual how much is the lemon meringue pie
her eyes were turgid with fear but her brain was functioning on some basic motor survival level
blurting on automatic thirty five cents
laughing i mean the whole pie
the waitress moans
gonzo places a bill on the counter
lets say five dollars
gonzo walks round the counter taking the pie out of the the sight of the blade had triggered bad memories
the glazed look in her eyes said her throat had been cut
she was still in the grip of paralysis when we left
gonzo urges him out the door
the camera retreats with them
the waitress stands there petrified
alone in a lousy bar at night
dukes face as he stares at the knife remembering
we have fifteen fucking minutes to get me on that plane
the white whale looking like shit its top half up as the light turns red
duke drives silent and furious sick to his stomach with the psychotic gonzo
what are you doing
you were supposed to turn back there
we had abused every rule that vegas lived by burning the locals abusing the tourists terrifying the help
the only chance now i felt was the possibility that wed gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe
duke suddenly slams on the brakes
there crossing the road in front of them is lucy her paintings under her arm looking lost
she looks up with duke throws the car into a skidding reverse turn and roars looks wildly around
what are we doing out here on this godforsaken road
gonzo sees that theyre running parallel with the airport the airport is over there
never missed a plane yet
duke hits the brakes and wrenches the wheel takes the whale down into the grassy freeway divider
wheels churning he makes it up the opposite bank nose of the car straight up then bounces onto the freeway and keeps going right over a fence dragging it through
a cactus field and onto the gonzo is frozen with fear gripping the dashboard
he throws a worried look at duke
ill drop you right next to the plane
they speed under a parked airplane shouting above the jet no
i cant get out
theyll crucify me
ill have to take the blame
just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and i picked you up
you never saw me before
shit this town is full of white cadillac convertibles
i plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate
but for christs sake just do it fast
duke screeches up in front of the desert air
gonzo duke watches him go relents
gonzo stops turns
dont take any guff from those swine
remember if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the right people
explaining my position
some asshole wrote a poem about that once
probably good advice if you have shit for brains
gonzo turns and races towards the steps just as he is about there he goes one of gods own prototypes a high powered mutant of some kind never even considered
for mass production
too weird to live and too rare to die
duke watches for a second then roars away
pull back with on the tv an airplane soars thru the sky
pull back to find duke barricaded in gonzos bedroom
he is typing on his typewriter
we are all wired into a survival trip now
no more of the speed that fueled that s
that was the fatal flaw in tim learys trip
he crashed around america selling consciousness expansion without ever giving a thought to the grim meat hook realities that were lying in wait for all the people who took him
duke records like a war correspondent
the camera slowly rises duke alone in the room with the tv spewing out all those pathetically eager acid freaks who thought they could buy peace and understanding for three
bucks a hit
but their loss and failure is ours too
what leary took down with him was the central illusion of a whole life style that he helped create
a generation of permanent cripples failed seekers who never understood the essential old mystic fallacy of the acid culture the desperate assumption that somebody
or at least some force is tending the light at the end of the tunnel
a burning flared out sun
the camera pans down to duke driving the wrecked whale
a piece of the fence flies out of the back seat as he takes a bump
there was only one road back to l
us interstate just a flat out high speed burn through baker and barstow and berdoo then on to the hollywood freeway straight into frantic oblivion safety obscurity just another freak
in the freak kingdom
duke sees the hardware barn a rustic old farm building facing the road with a single gas pump outside and a neon sign that flashes beer
duke pulls off the road and parks
gets out and walks in
duke enters the dark cluttered interior
scattered all about the store are bits of americana
old barrels wagon rafters
the sunlight shafts through high windows
an old man is repairing an iron pot bellied stove near the wooden bar
a norman rockwell painting
whatll you have
duke cant quite believe this place too good to be true
doubtfully ballantine ale
the proprietor serves the ale up ice cold
duke smiles and hard to find it served like this anymore
as he drinks duke toys with a rack of key chains little pie betty boop a baseball player
the logo on the rack reads american dream key rings
where ya comin from young man
a great town that vegas
i bet you had good luck there
youre the type
im a triple scorpio
trustingly thats a fine combination
you cant lose
a lovely girl appears
seeing duke she smiles
can this really be his lucky day
she approaches him
caught off guard
muttering oh my god
not understanding this is my granddaughter
recovering dont worry
leans forward in confidence and im actually the district attorney from ignoto county
winks just another good american like yourself
wordlessly the proprietor and his granddaughter go to the back of the store get on with their work ignoring duke
duke puts some money down on the bar and slowly leaves
a chastened duke approaches the vomit streaked white whale
gets in sits there deflated miserable
a state bus draws up across from the hardware barn
somberly duke watches as two young marines with duffel bags step off chatting like true brothers
duke switches on the ignition
something rolls off the trembling dash
duke catches it
duke guns the engine with a laugh leans out yells at the two marines look after him confused
duke drives fast teeth gritted in frozen ecstasy
my heart was filled with joy
i felt like a monster reincarnation of horatio alger
a man on the move
and just sick enough to be totally confident
the white whale wipes the screen black
