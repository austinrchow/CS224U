written by jason filardi october a few cars scatter the parking lot
we hear grunts followed by the distinct sound of basketballs shredding net
an empty gymnasium except for a shirtless mike odonnell
mike stands feet beyond the point line grabs balls from a hopper and rapidly shoots shoots shoots
this kids automatic
mikes hair a pompadour mullet a la jump street and short shorts circa
mustached and curly haired coach harvey enters
hey odonnell save some for the game
mike sinks one last jumper turns to the coach
just warming up coach
coach harvey hands mike a towel
first game of the season and the scouts are already lining up
you have half the season i know youre capable of you can play anywhere you want mike
thats the plan coach
the rest of the fitch falcons basketball team jogs out from the locker room followed by a photographer
round up jock straps
the team assembles in the middle of the court
a player kneeling in front holds a sign fitch falcons
eds not here yet
dom handsome tall long rat tail scoffs
hes the water boy
and you suck dom but were letting you in the picture
a shoving match breaks out between mike and dom
knock it off
coach harvey pulls the players apart just as the gym doors burst open
ed freedman sporting a jacket over a wizard costume runs in trips on his robe gets up peels his clothes off
sorry im late
i was locked in a life and death battle with the dark wizard
fall in freedman
ed takes a spot next to dom
and we see dom reach behind ed grab hold of his underwear
and with the flash we cut to the falcons run pass and shoot on one end of the court
on the opposite end a team in blue warms up
cue mc hammers cant touch this
cheerleaders at center court perform the hammer dance routine
pan around the gym everybodys doing the hammer dance
ed awkwardly tries to imitate mike
coach shakes his head in disgust and when the routine ends alright ladies bring it in
the falcons swarm to the bench take seats
ed hands waters to the players skips dom stops at mike
ed i cant help you with the girls if you keep showing up places dressed like the cookie crisp guy
dude dont look now but i think muffy campanella is scopin you hard
ed jerks around to blatantly stare at her
ed flashes a goofy smile
muffy mimes puking
girls voice o
scarlet an s beauty stands at the end of the bench
whos that stone cold fox
oh its my girlfriend
walks over im glad youre here scar
this whole scout things got me wicked nervous
dom dribbles past smiles at scarlet
im dedicating my first basket to you scarlet
way you shoot that might be mid season
to scarlet everything cool
she smiles nervously lies
everythings totally copacetic
referee blows the whistle
remember boys winners get the girls
losers please themselves
to scarlet excellent
he kisses her cheek starts off turns back whats wrong
long shot we hear nothing but see mikes body deflate
he steps away from scarlet towards center court
muffy and her friends mock ed and laugh hysterically do you really think muffys in to me
mike in a daze walks right past ed
takes his place for the jump ball
the crowd stomps and cheers loudly
the ref is about to toss the ball
mike looks up at the stands sees a crushed scarlet heading for the exit
play or go after her
he goes after her
where you going
mike rushes in
she turns slumps against the wall
mike catches up to her
mike leans in and kisses scarlet
the sound of an alarm clock shatters the silence as we settle in on a large mediterranean style house
mike odonnell now angrily slaps the alarm off
he climbs out of bed bones creaking stiff groans
a showered suited mike stands before the mirror knots a tie around his neck
today is going to be a good day
i love my job
i am a lucky man
mike yanks his tie straight up as if he were hanging himself
ed freedman now lies on a portable table in his boxers
acupuncture needles protrude from every inch of his body neck and face
at least needles
a hot young acupuncturist adds more to him
can you feel your qi flowing freely
im not sure if its my qi or internal bleeding
mike enters shakes his head in amusement
what are you doing now
ed looks over sees mike watching
there he is
fei jing acupuncture
its all the rage
makes you look five years younger
ed climbs slowly off the table shuffles over groaning in pain the entire way
he pours himself a shot of brown liquid from a pitcher throws the shot back and immediately spits it all over the place
calls to acupuncturist whats this brown stuff again
to mike the girl has absolutely no clue what shes doing
then why are you letting her stick needles in you
because shes hot
but todays not about me
its about you becoming the new regional sales manager
i better be
ive invested years of my life in that miserable company
negativitys for the pound fat lady who needs to be airlifted out of bed
you michael shawn odonnell are a winner
a winner doesnt have to crash at his best friends house because he was kicked out of his own house
are you kidding
it doesnt get any better than this
i gotta get back
my legs just went numb
good luck today
ed drags painfully back to the acupuncturist
mike wheels his audi a below a nondescript two level building
sign reads wyatt pharmaceuticals
pharmaceutical drug posters cover the walls
smiling faces happy couples
surrounding a conference table are mikes colleagues
hot women to in skimpy business suits chatting away
mike sits amongst them the only male present
a glum look on his face
wendy bubbly ditsy leans over to him
you deserve it
youre like a totally amazing salesman
that like totally means so much to me
roger boss strides through the door
good morning peeps
as you all know today ill be naming the new regional sales manager
whats it take to be an rsm
leadership skills a comprehensive knowledge of todays prescription pharmaceuticals and most importantly a dedicated soldier
mike straightens his tie buttons his suit jacket
all being said congratulations mike begins to rise wendy
dumbfounded mike slumps back into his seat
wendy springs up out of hers screaming and bouncing
now go out there and sell some drugs peeps
the women stream out
how could you do this to me
ive been a salesman here years
wendys only been here months
look your sales are admittedly better but she has the college degree
what can i do
you can give me the promotion roger
things have changed
i couldnt even hire you now with only a high school diploma
my hands are tied bro ski
mike swallows his pride and exits
mike pulls into the empty parking lot climbs out of his car and into the building
mike hurries down the hall opens a door peeks his head in
mike peers around
a basketball sits in the middle of the floor
mike enters picks up the ball begins dribbling
faster between his legs around his back up to the point line
mike hits a perfect jumper at the imaginary buzzer smiles
the kids still got it
mike dashes for the bouncing ball scoops it up goes for a reverse lay up makes it but when he lands
mike grabs his lower back groans ooooh
that was stupid
mike limps out of the gym wanders over to a wall covered in photographs
fitch basketball teams of the past
mike searches the pictures until he finds it
the photo we saw being taken earlier
the team of
ed mid howl from doms wedgy
mike stares at the photograph
lost in time and thought
the smiling confident image of his youth stares back at him
male voice o
you know someone in that picture
mike startles from his daydream turns
a kind faced old janitor stands behind him mop in hand
im in the center there
the janitor leans in takes a closer look at young mike
adolescence can be so cruel
what are you talking about
lost in the picture i had life by the balls in that picture
everything was possible
then a few minutes later pffffft all gone
for of all sad words of tongue and pen the saddest are these it might have been
thatll be my epitaph
we all have regrets
whys it have to be that way
maybe it does maybe it doesnt
cant hurt to ask
you never know whos listening michael
michael wistfully eyes the old photo looks back to the how did you know
what are you doing dad
alex messy hair and slight and maggie and awkwardly pretty appear at the other end of the hall
i was just talking to mike looks back to the janitor
sorry im late
you ready to get some dinner then
they make their way towards the door
why are you limping
tweaked my back pumping iron
really really heavy iron
mike alex and maggie sit before dinner
alex eats heartily
maggie quietly pushes her food around
i bet your chompin at the bit for hoop season to start
yeah me and the guys are running drills scrimmaging getting in shape
maggie stifles a laugh
thats my boy
remember its not how big you are its how big you play
father and son touch fists
and what about you mags
she got into georgetown
its no big deal
its a huge deal
thats a great university
im proud of you
maggie remains quiet am i missing something here
you wouldnt understand
i have a lot of emotional stress right now
my friends are all going to different schools im not even sure
thats not stress
wait til you get out into the real world get a crappy job have some smarmy twerp boss calling you bro ski
maggie rolls her eyes
did you get the promotion dad
still waiting to hear
mike forces a smile hiding his disappointment
mike pulls up behind a doms nursery van
he alex and maggie step out
mike eyes the van with disdain
is your mom home
shes probably out back
hey next week well have a barbecue at uncle eds
im counting down the minutes
maggie heads straight for the modest ranch house and inside
whats with her
we see you once a week for a couple hours
what do you expect
alex follows maggie into the house
mike makes his way around back
as mike rounds the corner he almost runs into a smiling dom johnson
don lugs loaded trash bags
good to see you
tough break you and scarlet
bite me dom
dom serves mike a cocky wink continues on
scarlet slams a shovel into the ground wedges it beneath a dying shrub and rips it out
a little late for a delivery isnt it
dom was in the neighborhood
he offered to make a dump run for me
doesnt he live miles from here
whats your point
hes been after you since th grade and hes after you now
at least someones after me
mike smiles playfully and begins to serenade in touch with the ground im on the hunt im after you
scarlet shakes her head please mike
this isnt high school
thats not gonna work
smell like i sound im lost in a crowd and im hungry like the wolf
mike flirtatiously stalks her
scarlet fights smiling
you can stop now
its not working
mouth is alive with juices like wine and im hungry like the wolf mike gets close to scarlets face
she smiles stops herself and pushes him away
you no longer have the right to invoke the wolf
a chastised mike eyes the yard
its a wreck
holes and mounds of dirt everywhere carcasses of dead plants bushes and flowers strewn about
why are you destroying the yard
scarlet stops shoveling wipes dirt from her face
im gonna use it as a showpiece for clients
thanks for asking
kind of a big undertaking isnt it
i am a landscape designer
then again you barely took an interest in my work so i guess thats a fair question
an awkward silence
then i didnt get it
but maybe this is what you needed
maybe its time you looked for something else
thats a great idea scar
because there are so many options out there for a year old with only a high school diploma
scarlet throws the shovel to the ground
and its all my fault isnt it
i didnt say that
no but its what you think right
mikes silence says it all
scarlet fights back tears
i never asked you to marry me
but i did
scarlet shakes her head in frustration
im sorry youre not happy with the way your life turned out mike really i am but youre not the victim here
scarlet goes back to shoveling
mike turns steps falls into a hole
a somber mike drives alongside the los angeles river
an old song plays low on the radio
thunder roars scaring mike and literally shaking the audi
rain drops in buckets
mike turns the wipers on high
not much help
he slows the car to a crawl straining to see out the windshield
we see the janitor leaning over the railing looking into the raging river
mike brakes throws his door open jumps out into the pouring rain
get away from there
mike blinded by the rain makes his way to the railing
the janitors gone
mike leans over the rickety railing looks down
the phosphorescent water swirls angrily
mike cant take his eyes off lightening flashes mikes year old face reflection stares back up at him
what the crack
the railing breaks
headlong into the river
mikes audi rolls into the driveway
the door swings open
a muddy shoeless foot steps out followed by a shoed foot but in no better shape
we follow the feet tattered slacks dragging on the cement to the door
filthy hands dig into pockets searching damn it
pushes doorbell ed
i lost my key
ed wrapped in a robe tissue between his toes wobbles to the door so as not to mess up his freshly polished nails
ive been worried sick
ed opens the door
standing before him is mike covered in mud
his ripped grimy suit now hangs off of him because
eds eyes widen with fear
ive had a really rough night
ed slams the door frantically wobbles away
the door opens angle on the muddy feet as they enter and follow the trail of cotton balls up the stairs and to the bathroom door
angle on ed cowering against the back wall brandishing an over sized loofah
the door slowly swings open
ed gasps dont come any closer
ill use it
what are you gonna do
exfoliate me to death
ed shrieks you got into my samples case again didnt you
a whimpering ed points to the mirror
whats your problem its only mud
the muddy feet turn toward the mirror and angle on the mirror
he turns on the water splashes his face frantically
mike tears his suit jacket and shirt off
he yanks off his pants peeks down his boxers im dreaming right
is this some kind of hallucination
mike pulls ed up by his robe
ed throws a knee into mikes nuts bolts out the door screaming
i said pinch
ed reaches the door fumbles with the locks
he just manages to open the door when mike tackles him to the floor
the two buddies roll around limbs intertwined
we need to talk
we can work this out
female voice o
aye dios mio
they stop wrestling look up
the latino maid stands in the doorway genuflecting
maria were just friends
the maid hurries off muttering prayers in spanish
my theory is that you were transformed by a freak congruence of some of the planets most volatile elements
ive recreated the exact contents of the la river
the toxic pollutants the contaminants
reveal mike in the gurgling green water of the hot tub
well it obviously isnt working
thats because the cocktails not complete
ed picks up a toaster attached to an extension cord
last night we had the worst electrical storm of the last hundred years
is that true
it was pretty bad
ed raises the toaster wait
do you really think thisll work
ed tosses it in
wont be a moment
ed reaches down to plug it in
what were you doing by the river anyway
close on mike light bulb goes off
he leaps out runs for the house
the audi screeches to a stop in front of the school
mike bounds out wearing a robe races inside
mike rushes past baffled students asking no one in has anyone seen the janitor
is the janitor here
wheres the janitor
mike reaches the familiar wall of pictures
kids point laugh stare
a female janitor steps from a room
can you tell me where i can find the night janitor
im the only custodial engineer currently employed here
there was an old guy white hair
i showed him this picture of me mike points to the team photo
that pictures from
mike backs away from the picture and the janitor
confused mike stumbles to the bathroom
hes about to enter three letter jacket wearing jocks stan jazz and kevin burst out laughing knocking mike on the way by
mike enters moves to a sink turns the water on voice o
can i get a little help in here
mike turns sees what appears to be underwear stretched over the corner of a closed stall door
mike approaches the door swings it open
there hangs alex sneakers dangling feet off the ground
the back of his underwear wrenched up over the corner of the door
what are you doing up there
i wanted to see if i could get my nuts into my esophagus
what do you think im doing
get me down
ill get you down
mike pulls the underwear off the door
alex drops reaches down his pants adjusts his underwear
how do you know my name
your uncle eds son
he told me to look out for you
uncle ed has a son
believe me its gonna be a surprise to him too
did those guys do this to you
goons from the basketball team
because they can and so they do on a daily basis
but youre one of them
no im not
nice robe guy
alex walks out bowlegged
a devastated mike watches him go
mike drives off out of the parking lot
to his left he spies angle on stan and maggie making out against stans mustang
mike pounds on the horn scaring them apart
ed sits at the island a laptop in front of him
on the screen we see hes perusing www
the sound of the front door opening and closing
did you find the janitor
he doesnt exist
nothing makes sense
did he ask you for your soul
thats a good sign
we can eliminate satan
clicks on a link i think what were dealing with here is a spell of enlightenment
peruses the page spell affect
yada yada yada
basically its a learning spell
theres something you need to figure out and until you do youll stay a kid
my guess is that janitor was probably a war
im going back to high school
could you repeat that
because i thought you just said you were
going back to high school
mike grabs a beer from the fridge cracks it
as mike is about to take a sip ed swipes the beer from his hand
chugs it down
are you out of your freaking mind
my son was hanging by his underwear from a bathroom stall door and my daughter was being mauled by a smarmy gorilla
they need me
what about your job
email and telephone
i got it covered
well scarlet then
what are you gonna tell her
youre just gonna disappear
to be honest i think shed rather have it that way
whats with the attitude
because i know youre going to suck me into this and im not going back there mike
youll never get me to go back to fitch
i hate you
pull back to reveal ed and mike sit outside principals office
mike is dressed in an overly exaggerated hip style a grown ups concept of whats cool he looks ridiculous
take a deep breath
all you have to do is enroll me and say as little as possible
mike pulls a manila folder out of his book bag
are you sure these look legit
offended cocky please
i created software used to launch the space shuttle
i think im capable of forging some report cards
whats up with the gear
this is hip teenage apparel
i got it right off the mannequin at ed hardy
goodwin will see you now
mike and ed stand head for the door marked principal

goodwin sits behind her desk

eds face lights up and without missing a beat so glad we chose this school
im ed freedman
ed steps in front of mike shakes ms

mike tries to peer around ed
mike finally physically moves ed steps aside

ed smiles rubs mikes head vigorously
mike slaps his hand

mike and ed sit

eds smile fades

mike hands julie the folder
as julie browses through it ed and mike get into a pinching elbowing fight
when she looks up the friends stop
so the last school you went to was cutler high in connecticut
and you were a straight a student
i help him with his homework
oh dad the doctor called

it is herpes
eds jaw drops
julie rises abruptly
i think its time we got mark to class
the door opens in steps lisa
lisa will you print out a schedule for mark and show him to class
come on mark
ed addresses him as fatherly as he knows how be a good boy now
and sit up straight
mike glares at ed follows lisa out
ed turns to julie
they grow up so fast
i beg your pardon
you strike me as a mojito gal
i know this little cuban place great yeah no
i dont date my students parents
its a rule of mine
ill enroll him somewhere else
i really need to get back to work
julie ushers ed to the door
see you at the next bake sale then
julie shuts the door shakes her head in disbelief
mike steps in
scattered giggles at his appearance
mike takes a seat eyes three sexy girls wearing next to nothing samantha lauren and jamie busy texting on their phones
do their mothers know they dress like that
a girl next to him leans over those are the wonder bras
the jocks stan jazz and kevin strut in
mikes eyes narrow
stan stops before mike looks him up and down what did you did do
mug the mannequin at the ed hardy store
laughter from the class
the jocks sit stan behind mike
just as the last bell rings maggie rushes in sits with the bras
oh thank god hes not here
i ran all the way from something catches maggies eye
its mike waving to her
whys that freak waving at me
maggie places a hand over her face looks down
male voice o
take your seats
stop the talking
adams prissy strides in carrying a stack of papers
here are yesterdays tests
lets see how you all did
moans from the class
adams walks up and down the aisle slapping them down on the desks
adams reaches maggie drops the test on her desk
d for odonnell
humiliated maggie lowers her head
let me guess
maggie nods where are we going
if you flunk senior calculus youll be lucky to get into beauty school missy
so if you plan on slacking your way through my class dont
save your parents tuition money and pick up a blow dryer
mike angrily stands enough
adams turns to mike
do you think humiliating a year old in front of her peers is helpful or do you just get off on it
and you are
its my first day
adams turns walks back towards the front of the room
freedman stan signals his friends takes out a lighter flicks it leans forward and places the flame between mikes legs
the flame glows red against mikes jeans
the jocks and bras pull out their cells and begin videoing
adams scribbles on a pad youve earned yourself a trip to the principals office
welcome to fitch
adams rips the paper off holds it out towards mike
mike sniffs at the air is someone barbecuing
mike leaps out of his shoes
a flame runs up his crotch
mike screaming runs around the room fanning his package
get out mr
mike snatches the slip from adams and out the door
a packed lunchroom
the cliques sit amongst themselves
we notice all the kids hunched over staring at their phones
mike enters carrying a bag lunch
a black burn mark on the crotch of his pants
a gaysian spots him yells go hot pants
do your dance girl
the entire cafeteria turns to mike and erupts in laughter
as mike passes each table we see the kids are watching his fire dance on their phones
mike approaches a table of the biggest losers in school unkempt hair fat acne
mike begins to sit when look we feel your pain
we really do
but lifes hard enough brother
mike nods continues on past the snickering and catcalls until he sees maggie and the wonder bras
angle wonder bra table
maggie samantha jamie and lauren pick around plates of cafeteria food
whats the big deal
he stuck up for me in class
it was a nice thing to do
he was totally sexing on you
pretend youre not here
mike approaches big smile
the wonder bras look off in every direction except mikes
im mark the girls continue looking away ignoring mike
oh my god
cant you see were not here
so theres plenty of room then
mike drops down next to samantha and across from maggie
he brought a bag lunch
special ed mike hides his lunch
look this table is v
youre a nip
whats a nip
maggie why are you friends with these horrible girls
listen i appreciate what you did in class but i already have a boyfriend
you have a boyfriend
his phone rings excuse me a second
mike pulls out an older blackberry phone looks at the caller id
he sends it to voice mail
he still gets calls
i think my grandfather has that phone
maggie could we talk somewhere the sound of a bouncing ball interrupts
male voice o
stan jazz and kevin swagger over
bro ski what are you doing at our table
he was just leaving
maggie nods for mike to go
we should do this again sometime
stan pulls maggie up starts making out with her hands all over her
we can see mikes blood boil until get your hands off her you little punk
stan stops groping steps over to mike a solid foot taller than him
you gotta problem with me bra
mike looks around
the entire cafeteria watches
defeated no no i dont
stan takes mikes hat off picks up an ice cream from maggies tray puts the ice cream in the hat places it back on mikes head and smushes it down
now make like tom and cruise
flush with humiliation and ice cream dripping down his face mike turns and walks out
that was so not cool
ill buy you another ice cream
we see alex seated by himself at a back table shake his head in disgust
a beaten down mike sits alongside ed at the bar
it was terrible
the place is evil ed
that building needs to be exorcised
it couldnt have been that bad
my beanbag was lit on fire videoed and sent to every member of student body
yeah i caught it on youtube
they mocked my clothes and phone
my daughter got a tongue bath in front of me and i have mint chip in my ears
high schools great isnt it
the bartender approaches
what can i get you
double scotch neat
get the boy a shirley temple
the bartender nods serves up the drinks
mike miserably plucks a cherry off his pink drink
im not going back there
mike youre an adult sitting on years of experience
you should be dominating these kids ripping their hearts out
an older woman takes a seat next to the boys
i know why youre encouraging me all of a sudden
because im a supportive dad
because you want to nail my principal
did she ask about me
shes not your type
as far as i can tell thats her only flaw
i need a reason to see her again
you could flunk your classes start a fight vandalise the place
youll figure it out
then i can rush in a teary eyed helpless single dad who cant handle his angry kitten killing son
what do you think
the older lady having listened to it all turns to ed i think you should be reported to child services
mind your business lady
this is a family matter
the lady turns away in disgust
i cant do it
i dont have it in me
hey no sweat off my sack
tell alex to stop wearing underwear all together
hell be fine
thats what i did
mike eyes ed considers just how well adjusted ed is
a determined look comes over mike
he pounds the bar
my kids need me
now what you need is a crash course on being a teen in
the boys gather a stack of teen magazines and tabloid rags
ed slips a melons magazine into the pile
a picture of a young popular star torn from one of the teen mags hangs on the mirror
a hairdresser cuts away and highlights mikes long locks
ed sits beside mike sipping wine enjoying a manicure
its the pretty woman scene
hip salesgirls pull clothes from racks
a clean cut mike tries on sneakers jeans t shirts hoodies shirts jewelry
ed nods with his approval or disapproval
at the register the girls hand mike his bags of clothes
ed takes out his cell to put their numbers in it
the girls frown and go back to work
mike and ed stand before the wall of top albums
both wear headphones listening and moving to the music
mike and ed surrounded by the magazines and music discs sit before the computer
ed teaches mike how to create a myspace page
bogus about me and interests
photoshopped pictures of mike in exotic locations
all the now movies music and books
they fill his friends section with only hot girls
the boys view the flashy finished product tap fists
this page makes mark freedman look like a playboy
a salesman hands a smiling mike his new iphone
mike sits on the bed types away on his laptop
a knock on the door
mike looks up and yells
ed stands in the doorway his entire body and head wrapped in seaweed
before you ask its a seaweed wrap
im detoxifying as well as losing an inch or from my problem areas
there must be a very hot girl downstairs
what are you doing
i forwarded my calls to my new phone sent some work emails and just lobbed one to scarlet told her i was in peru finding myself
think shell buy it
probably not because when she called earlier i told her you were being detained at guantanamo
ready for tomorrow
i am so ready
ed flips mike a set of keys
mikes eyes light up
that oughta put you over the top
and dont forget to hook me up son
ed plods off
off mikes huge smile
the usual pre school ritual
stan jazz kevin the wonder bras and maggie all hang around stans stang
stan and maggie wrapped in a heated embrace kissing
a horn blares
stan and maggie jump out of the way
an aston martin vanquish stops next to the crew
the tinted window rolls down revealing the new and improved mike
mike winks then rolls on past
oh my god
was that did you see i told you he was cute
its the moment
mike walks the hallway handsome and hip
samantha lauren and jamie text by their lockers
mike struts up to them
the bras smile
so ive been here a couple days now and i think i got it figured out
you girls are lesbians right
the bras jaws hit the floor
mike walks off a huge grin on his face
man that felt good
mike steps from the kitchen area carrying a tray scans the crowded room finds alex seated at a table alone
its a heartbreaking image
mike approaches mind if i sit here
you look totally different
mike sits across from alex
i got rid of the bulls eye on my forehead
could you move to the left a little
mike inches left peeks behind him
girls eat lunch together
the one facing them is a cute latino nicole
alex quickly shies away
shes in my spanish class
have you spoken to her
i get all stupid so i just stare
ill tell you a funny story
the first time i met your mother i was so nervous my mother
you said the first time i met your mother i was so nervous
is your mom hot
whats going on tonight
you wanna hang out
yeah you could show me around
the wonder bras sway in take seats at the vip table
ill swing by your house around
i wouldnt go over there
stan and his baboons have lunch this period
ill see you tonight
mike strolls over to the bras table plunks himself down
did you girls catch ellen yesterday
rosie was on
melissa etheridge jammed youre so rude
were not gay
we like boys
yeah samanthas a total slu
samanthas jaw drops
last new years samantha made it with my boyfriend
i was on like red bulls
i cant believe you keep bringing that up
the bras begin to bicker amongst themselves
mike pulls out his new iphone plugs the earphones in his ears
the bras immediately stop bickering ogle the phone
ill text you
mike rises from the table
like wed ever give you our numbers
stan carrying a basketball his goons and maggie come up behind mike
stan whips the ball at mike
mike cat quick spins around catches the ball
the whole cafeteria turns their attention on mike and stan
mike points to the name stan on stans letter jacket reads stan
did mommy sew that on there so you wouldnt forget your name
laughter from the students
you think cause you got a haircut and new clothes peopled forget what a fag you are
cut it out stan
gimme my ball back bee yotch
mike ignores him and starts dribbling
you know stan i feel sorry for you
you dont know me
mike speaks loudly now playing to the cafeteria
oh but i do
all too well
youre the man
captain of the basketball team
dates the pretty girls
high school is your kingdom
stan and his posse tap fists
mike dribbles between his legs
but people stans a bully
it would be way too easy to say stan preys on the weak because hes simply a dick
no stans more complex than that
according to leading psychiatrists stan is a bully for of reasons
under all that male bravado theres an insecure little girl banging on the closet door trying to get out
like a caveman stans brain is underdeveloped
therefore stan is unable to use self control so he acts out aggressively
and the third reason mike holds up his pinky then spins the ball on it
id argue that stan suffers from all
the entire cafeteria laughs hysterically
mike feigns whipping it back at stan who recoils then gently rolls the ball back to stan
dont hurt yourself big boy
some students including alex erupt
the wonder bras eye mike with new found lust
angle on mikes face as he walks away
mike ducks just as the ball whizzes overhead rockets across the cafeteria landing on miss goodwins tray splattering her with food
she glares at stan
mikes iphone buzzes
angle on screen the wonder bras digits appear
mike enters approaches mrs
my guidance councilor made me come but just so you know im not planning on going to college
a lot of kids feel that way
dont be intimidated
it doesnt hurt to take a look
mencer hands mike a hefty book
a good place to start is here
this book has information on every college and university in the country
mike sits starts paging through the book and gets lost in the bright colored pictures
smiling students campuses and a pumped up mike dials
on the seat beside him rests a stack of college applications
it was incredible
i was incredible
you shoulda seen me
i humiliated stan in front of the entire lunchroom
everyone was clapping
the popular girls were begging to give me their numbers
see what happens when you put a little lipstick on the pig
did you manage to get sent to the principals office
man i feel great
i even shot some hoops after school
gotta run buddy
mike hangs up
the aston martin pulls up
mike climbs out walks to the door takes a deep breath and rings the bell
the door opens revealing scarlet in her dirty yard attire
ive been dying to meet you
ive known your father since
visibly stunned by the resemblance
is something wrong
you look like
scarlet and mike sit across from one another
scarlet stares at mike as if examining every pore on his face
and you say ed freedman is your father
thats my dad
all inches of him
you dont look anything like him
if you dont mind me asking whos your mother
mike spies dostoevskys crime and punishment on a table
in new jersey
they met while dad was at princeton
she was on parole
b e fist fighting shanking
but shes dead now
i warned her about kite surfing during hurricane season
so how are things with you
doing anything exciting
flirting with dom johnson maybe
why would you ask about dom
did ed tell you to say that
i mean do what you want
youre a grown woman but word on the street is doms been spreading gingivitis all over town
ill keep that in mind mark
scarlet cant take her eyes off mike
its crazy how much you like my husband when he was a teenager
mike switches subjects points to her dirty clothes you doing some gardening
im a landscape designer
im actually redoing the backyard
ill show you
scarlet stands leads mike to the french doors
its a work in progress so youll have to use your imagination some
scarlet opens the doors flips on the lights
the yards been cleaned up
fresh blankets of sod rest in piles next to stacks of limestone
hundreds of unplanted plants flowers trees and shrubs sit around the yard in strategic positions
mike and scarlet step outside
i almost dont even recognize it
if i had seen it before i probably wouldnt recognize it
you wouldnt have
it was a disaster back here a few days ago
obviously i have a lot to do still
im laying the sod next and the limestone pathway will go here
scarlet moves about the yard pointing and explaining
then ill plant all those over a hundred different types of flowers and plants
i have an amazing fountain being delivered thatll go here and a bench over there
and ill string rows of tiny white lights above it all so every night will be a starry one
itll be a real sanctuary back here
it seems like a lota work for one person scar
a chill runs up scarlets spine
my husbands the only one that ever calls me that
alex appears at the doors interrupting yo mark
lets do this
good luck with the project
nice to meet you
and alex be home by
mike heads back inside
scarlet stares after him
mike and alex step in
hows your mom doing
you know with your dad not being around and all
she doesnt like to show it but i know shes bummed
i think it bothers her more that he hasnt called me or maggie in a while
mike pulls out his iphone text message from samantha
it reads wat
but w e
mike stares at the screen as if it were in hieroglyphics
i have no idea what this says
alex takes the phone from mike reads it says what up
mobbing it to zuma
so over it but whatever
be right back
got to go
talk to you later
lets hit the beach wingman
the two touch fists
a bonfire illuminates the night sky
kids lay on blankets play football
others splash in the ocean
we find maggie and the wonder bras seated by the fire
we were on his myspace page
theres a picture of him jamming with the chili peppers at coachella
i heard timbaland wants to produce an album with him
yeah but he turned him down to help orphans with brangelina in nambib ib bib
oh my god
i bet he knows justin
angle mike and a nervous alex make their way down the sand
this looks boring
lets go back to my house and play video games
mike grabs his arm turns him back
what are you so nervous about
the beach is for the older cool kids
i dont belong here
what are you talking about
youre a basketball player
i dont play basketball
i mean i can play i just dont play on the team
mike is stunned
but i thought you were getting ready for the season
i never told you that
as a confused mike and alex approach the scene boys call out to mike tap his fist
girls fawn over him
mikes become a celebrity
and hes eating it up
angle lauren spots mike with alex
here he comes
the bras whip their heads around get all dreamy
can he be any lamer
using my little brother to get to me
if that boy was an apple hed be delicious
samantha leaps up scurries over to mike
lauren and jamie chase after her
maggie shakes her head
as mike and alex approach the gathering alex freezes up
alex nods towards the fire
seated with friends is nicole
alex belches loudly
shes so pretty it makes me gassy
heres what youre gonna do
youre gonna go over there and introduce yourself she wont like me mark
im a loser
mike grabs alex by the shoulders
because stan says so
you think stans a winner
hes going nowhere
youre a great kid
any girl would be lucky to get your attention
and right now theres a girl over there whos dying to meet you
a determined look comes over alex
what do i say
just introduce yourself
then compliment her on something she never gets complimented on
like if she has big meaty man hands tell her she should be a hand model
alex burps nervously and dont burp on her
i can do that
alex takes a deep breath marches off just as samantha runs up and throws her arms around mike
why dont we take a walk somewhere private and play
jamie and lauren rush over
i dont think so sam
mark promised me a walk on the beach
walk with me
ive got less miles on me
a full blown argument breaks out between the bras
mike sees maggie sitting by the fire alone slips out
angle alex steps over to nicole and suddenly loses confidence
as he turns to retreat nicole looks up hi
alex stops turns back around and blurts out hi alex
nicole and her friends giggle
you dont look like a nicole
you have big meaty man hands
you should be a hand model
the girls jaws drop
nicole hides her hands
oh my god
alex rips a huge burp
the girls duck for cover
i think he got some on me
im just real nervous and ive wanted to talk to you for so long
and mark told me to compliment you on something you never get complimented on but i couldnt find anything because everythings so
nicole and her friends melt
do you want to sit down nicole
nicole scoots over making room next to her
angle mike sits down beside maggie
what do you want
why are you dating him
get to the point why dont you
hes not a nice guy
matter of fact hes a jackass
dont talk about him like that
you dont even know him
i know he bullies your brother
stan barely knows alex exists
were moving in together after graduation
i thought you were going to georgetown
im going to westwood community college
stan and i both are
mike loses it leaps to his feet shouting
the hell you are young lady
if you think im gonna let you throw your life away on some sleestack youre crazy
i forbid you to see him anymore and thats final
maggie jumps up
kids all stare
who do you think you are
maggie stomps over to the still bickering bras
dont you walk away from me margaret sarah odonnell
maggie and the bras turn towards mike and glare
maggie heads for the parking lot
he doesnt even know her name
hes so not into her
the bras make the text me sign then hurry after maggie
mike kicks angrily at the sand and accidentally into the faces of a group of kids
a hot girl wearing a lifeguard bathing suit sits atop a high chair
ed floats on a raft
a frozen drink next to him
scarlet looms over him the in a heated conversation i havent heard from him in three weeks
obviously he doesnt care
then where is he
mike steps from the house sees scarlet whats going on
i was just dropping something off
scarlet tosses a manila envelope on the patio table
our court date is the th
if he has anything to say he can say it then
what was that all about
that envelope contains divorce papers
mike eyes the envelope in stunned silence
but what do you care
youre going to college right
lifes one big panty raid for you
mike feigns innocence
i dont know what youre talking about
i saw the applications in your room
you went through my room
if youd cleaned like i asked i wouldnt have had to
you cant be serious about this can you
mike starts to argue then gives in i have to face the possibility that i might never turn back and if thats the case im going to do it right
this time around
karmically speaking in the next life youre coming back as a hemorrhoid
mike scoffs storms off
ed calls after him im not paying for college
mike shoves books in his locker
you like her dont you
she told me you were trashing me at the beach
leave her alone stan
shes a good kid
i dont know how good she is yet but after i find out shes all yours
stan walks off
mike slams his locker shut
mike slips inside the empty classroom slathers krazy glue all over stans desktop and chair
mike sits just as the rest of the class files in
stan kisses maggie and takes his seat
stan leans on his desk placing a forearm and a hand on the sticky desktop
he catches mike looking back at him and gives him a cocky wink
mike winks back knowingly
mikes phone beeps
he checks it
a pix message
perfect asses in tiny bikini bottoms
a wide eyed mike spins in his seat to find the wonder bras smiling at him
adams scribbles a large equation on the blackboard
this was your homework
who can come up here and solve this for me
blank uninterested faces
adams tosses the chalk angrily on his desk
not one person
come up here and dazzle us with your brilliance
maggie rises nervously from her seat shuffles to the front of the class
as she passes stan we see
stan lifts his fingers from the desktop
he places his wet fingers to the tip of his nose and smells
when stan tries to remove his fingers from his nose
stan tries to raise his other arm
stan stands hunched
the chair glued to his butt
the desk attached to his forearm and his fingers stuck to his nose
the kids and mike burst out laughing break out their video phones as stan fumbles around dragging the desk panicking
sit down stan
im glued to everything
jazz bounds out of his seat grabs hold of stans wrist
ill get it off
stans scream echoes
mike wearing basketball gear and bouncing a basketball stands in the middle of the court
i got your text
whats so important
this year youre making the team
we practice everyday til try outs
that gives us a week and a half
yeah youre right
you probably dont have any skills anyway
mike begins to walk out
i got skills
mike turns back
so whats your problem
is it stan and his friends
just leave it alone
you dont need to be afraid of them alex
im too small anyway
thats why we focus on your speed dribbling and outside shot
remember its not how big you are its how big you play
where did you hear that
i dont know
read it somewhere i guess
be a sport
show me what you got
mike tosses alex the ball
alex begins to dribble
mike steps up to defend
alex dribbles quicker through his legs
you got a little game
the doors slam open
in walk stan and his posse
a blood speckled band aid covers the tip of stans nose
what are you queers doing in my gym
lets go alex
alex stops dribbling
he and mike move towards the door
stan and his posse block the way
i dont think so
you girls wanna play with the boys then lets play
well save you the embarrassment for try outs
stan takes the ball from alex turns his back dribbles
come on ally
while dribbling stan moves backwards bumping into alexs midsection forcing alex back
back off stan
alex takes a deep breath tired of being afraid its okay
i got him
alex throws his hands up tries to defend the much bigger stan
stan easily backs alex down faking left and right
here it comes
stan spins elbows high
alex catches one to the head and drops
stan shoots and scores
and i was fouled
stan high s jazz and kevin
blind with rage mike rushes stan
tackles him hard to the floor
jazz and kevin throw mike off stan punching and kicking him
coach harvey now enters the gym runs over to the fracas pulls the boys apart
mike and a nervous alex sit outside the principals office
mike holds an ice pack to his eye
my moms been in there a while
shes gonna be pissed
act like youre hurt and she wont be able to stay mad at you
the door swings open
an elated ed blows in
way to go slugger
get any shots in
the secretarys jaw drops
freedman your son has a black eye
ed sits between mike and alex
how you doin buddy
im okay i guess
turns to mike nudges nice goin
how do i look
anything in my teeth
hows my breath
ed flashes his pearly whites then blows on mike
the principals door opens an angry scarlet steps out
exciting isnt it
my first parent principal conference
scarlet looks sternly to alex fighting
whats gotten into you
rubs his jaw i cant talk mom
my poor baby
and how about you mark
scarlet bends down so shes eye to eye with mike
she removes the ice pack
a purple shiner
you poor thing
does it hurt
scarlet strokes mikes face
mike loses himself in her caring gentle touch
you smell great
scarlet a bit weirded out by mike stands
alex ill meet you at the car
i need to talk to uncle ed for a second
alex shuffles out of the office
scarlet turns to ed hushed did you give him the divorce papers
i sent them to him
is it another woman
i can handle it
tell me the truth
i havent heard from him really
scarlet looks down fights back tears unravels a bit
if you do please have him call home
for the kids
im running out of excuses ill tell him
scarlet forces a smile
mike watches her go
for the first time hes seen her reality
hurt pain frustration
mike places his head sadly in his hands
julie the principal pokes her head out the door
ed come on in
ed whispers to mike
ill take it from here
as ed passes julie on the way in im heartbroken
the boys incorrigible
ed takes a seat across from julie puts on his best troubled parent look
look if it was only one isolated fight it wouldnt distress me all that much
boys will be boys
but its also been brought to my attention that mark may have krazy glued a boy to his chair
ed stifles a laugh puts on a serious face
get in here
mike slouches in takes a seat
did you glue a boy to his chair
ed throws his hands up in exasperation
the boys out of control
hes acting up at home
he wont eat his vegetables he shaves his back
he sucks his thumb
he wears girls underwear
he wets his bed
mark i know its hard to be the new kid but if i have anymore trouble from you youll be facing detentions or worse
you can go now
mike nods exits
ed stands and with exaggerated sadness hes crying out for help and i dont know what to do
it hurts so bad
maybe we could discuss this over margaritas
lets give him time to figure it out on his own
if the situation gets worse then well take the next step
youre the expert
im just a single dad out here blowing like dust in the wind
ed shakes julies hand and exits sniffling
a dirt covered scarlet wrestles a roll of sod down
got an extra pair of gloves
scarlet peers over her shoulder
mike wanders in
scarlet stands wipes her bare dirty hands on her jeans
gloves are for sissies
yeah but i just had a manicure
you want to help
are you kidding
i love landscaping
its right up there with watching sex and the city and snuggling
scarlet laughs eyes him skeptically mark im years old im just doing this to make a few bucks so i can buy laker tickets
ill give you dollars a day
at that rate i should be able to buy tickets in
grab a roll
mike and scarlet step over to the sod lift a roll together carry it over to the spot
what are the benefits like here
ill throw in a baloney sandwich
mike and scarlet share a laugh
mike strolls in sits at a back table pulls a college application from his knapsack
he takes out a pen places the tip to the paper where it says name when we hear the muffled sound of crying
mike rises follows the sobs through the maze of stacks until he finds maggie
seated on the floor head hidden between her knees
maggie looks up sees mike quickly dries her eyes
what do you want
to rub it in my face
say i told you so
you lost me
maggie drops her head back between her knees
stan dumped me
maggie bawls loudly
mike panics fearing the worst what happened
what did he do
my mom was working last night
stan came over with a box of mike slaps his palms over his ears
your next word better be cookies or youre in big big trouble
what am i going to do
i cant live without him
maggie takes mikes shirt blows her nose on it
maggie did you two
that rabbits do a lot of and that a girl your age should never do and should only do when shes married
no thats why he dumped me
maggie bawls again
mike silently celebrates sits beside her awkwardly pats her on the back
there there now
sure he was a jerk but he was there for me
which is more than i can say for any other man in my life
maggie sobs uncontrollably
mike takes a deep breath calms when youre young everything seems like the end of the world
but its not
its just the beginning
and you might have to meet a few more jerks but one day youll meet a boy who treats you the way you deserve to be treated
like the sun rises and sets with you
you really think so
i know so
maggie throws her arms around mike hugs him tight
mike hugs her back
a moment hes never had with his daughter
youre so sweet
angle on maggies face
alex dribbles using both hands while running through a maze of cones
whenever he messes up mike makes him start again
mike and scarlet settle the limestone rocks into the freshly laid sod creating a walkway
maggie solves a difficult problem on the board much to mr
maggie turns from the chalkboard and smiles flirtatiously at mike
stan catches this exchange and pops the back of mikes head
lights shine down
alex stands behind the point line
mike feeds him balls
alex shoots and moves
shoots and moves
more misses than hits
again mike and ed sit before a stern julie
mike teaches alex the cross over dribble
scarlet brings the boys water
mike checks her out as she goes back in the house
alex bounces the ball off his head
a muffled buzz
mike reaches into his pocket pulls out his phone
a pix message
mike opens it
a close up of perfect mike peeks over his shoulder
the wonder bras text on their phones
hes confused until mike turns a little more in his seat
maggie smiles seductively at him blows a kiss
mike gasps spins back around
scarlet fills holes with plants then waters them with a hose
she turns finds mike sleeping in the grass
scarlet picks up the hose turns it on him
mike leaps up chases her
mike alex nicole maggie the bras and a slew of kids hang by mikes aston
stan jazz and kevin are all thats left by stans mustang
alex scampers through the maze of cones dribbling from hand to hand
and does it perfectly
mike and alex high
mike and scarlet lug an ornate wooden bench to its spot
mike casually places a hand on scarlets leg
scarlet casually removes it
a game of on
alex dribbles up to mike
mike crouches in a defensive stance
mike goes for the ball
alex crosses over
alex pulls up shoots and scores
mike smiles shakes his head
again mike and ed sit before julie
she hands ed a slip of paper
ed chokes back crocodile tears
mike places books in his locker shuts the door revealing
a goo goo eyed maggie
mike startles and runs
alex stands behind the point line
mike rapidly feeds him balls
alex catches shoots and moves
theyre all going in
mike passes the last ball
alex shoots and we close on a ball going through the hoop
wider reveals alex following through
he and mike tap fists
its try outs
coach harvey a number of hopefuls maggie nicole and the bras watch the game of half court on
stan and jazz vs
mike and alex
mike and alex school stan and jazz
steals picks fancy passes and scoring
the coach watches with awe
a final pointer by mike in stans face seals the deal
as alex passes harvey harvey stops him youve gotta little bit of your old man in you odonnell
the team and the hopefuls huddle around coach harvey
as you all know due to the amount of seniors coming back i only have open spots on the roster
its freedman and odonnell
the rest of you hit the showers
the hopefuls trudge out of the gym
alex leaps into the air
we did it mark
we did it
you killed it out there
alex runs over hugs nicole
mike beams with pride
coach harvey puts an arm around him son i dont know where you came from but you just made my year
alex rushes through the door
mike and maggie follow
maggie slaps mikes butt
ill be right out honey
i gota use the bathroom
we follow mike down the hall
as he passes a half open door he pauses peeks in
scarlet facing away pulls a shirt over her nude back shakes out her long hair
no he gazes longingly lovingly
lost in her beauty until
scarlet turns startles mark
i didnt know you were there
you just look so beautiful
its been a while since shes heard that
can i zip you up
im wearing a sweater
scarlet walks towards him and
shuts the door on him
mike wanders to the bathroom shaking his head stupid idiot stupid
mike enters steps over to the toilet
maggie slips in behind him shuts the door
he whirls around
maggie places a finger on his lips
i get it now
why you didnt want me to be with stan the nice things you said in the library
its because you wanted me
maggie backs mike against the wall
maggie listen to me
im not the person you think
yes you are
youre a good guy
youre not like the others
im not like the others
im very different than the others
so different that you and i can never be
maggie stops looks quizzically at mike what are you trying to say
it all makes sense now
mike starts to speak
finally gets it what
no no no no
im not gay
ive been in love with the same girl since i was
maggie switches back into predatory mode
who is it
does she go to our school
do i know her
no you dont
now eyes the toilet if you dont mind
tell your girlfriend she better keep a close eye on you
maggie smiles seductively and struts out
alex types on his phone
who you texting
i have to tell him about today
alex and maggie look to mike
mike checks his phone
did you just get a text
i mean dad
not your dad
ill just call him back
she looks amazing
im dying to hear
i did it
im a falcon
the first games in weeks
oh my god alex
thats so incredible
scarlet wraps alex in a big hug
its a bittersweet moment for him
im so happy for you
and now i want to show you guys something
scarlet unable to contain her excitement leads mike and alex to the french doors and flicks a light switch
thousands of tiny white lights illuminate scarlets oasis
you hung the lights
i wanted you to be the first to see it
mom its sick
the step outside
mike truly blown away takes picture with his iphone
im sorry i never saw how talented you are
i mean when people see this and how talented you are youll be designing sanctuaries all over the city
mom why are you all dressed up
oh my god
i almost forgot
i have a date
off mikes stunned reaction
mike marches in behind scarlet
as they reach the door he steps in front of her
lets see who the lucky guy is
mike swings the door open revealing
i knew it
mike shuts the door blocks it
i knew you had a thing for him
you cant do this
you took vows
what kind of example are you setting for the kids
mark im flattered
really i am
but im too old for you
scarlet moves mike aside opens the door
dom stands in the doorway holding a bouquet
you look absolutely ravishing
keep it in your pants casanova
dont mind him
you all set
lets do it
scarlet heads for the van
dom looks to mike hey kid
if the vansa rockin
well you know the rest
dom imitates humping jogs after scarlet
dont you lay a finger on her johnson
i know where you live
mike slams the door
a contemplative alex scoops lasagna onto plates
an agitated mike enters pulls up a seat at the counter
its weird to think about my mom with someone other than my dad
if this were afghanistan shed be dragged through the village by goats
you need to talk to her
my moms been pretty sad the past few months
she deserves to be happy
my dad obviously is
wherever he is
maybe hes not
maybe he wishes he could be here right now with you but theres a real good reason he cant be
no my dads not a family guy
this is dumb but i used to tell him i was on the basketball team because i knew hed never make it to a game
then why would you tell him that
i guess i was hoping it would make him like me more
mike is crushed
mike paces in front of a dressing room
a salesman waits by the door
my wifes moving on
my son doesnt think i like him and my daughters in love with me
i need to change back ed
ed steps from the changing room wearing very tight ultra hip clothes that belong on a year old
he looks ridiculous
what about college
im not going
ill be a pharm rep til i die
i just want my family back
youre not gonna wear that are you
ed checks his butt in a full length mirror nods happily
babys got back
ed retreats into the changing room
ed contd o
now that julies agreed to go out with me tonight i need you to start behaving
i cant have her thinking my son is a complete degenerate
i want to have some kids over tonight to celebrate alex making the team
is that cool
ed wearing only his banana hammock underwear and socks steps from the room hands the clothes to the salesman
wrap it up
no its not cool
i remember hearing what those parties were like kids peeing everywhere food on the ceilings puke in the pool
listen to you
you sound like an old man
other shoppers eye ed oddly as they pass
i mean it
dont make me take the car away
dont treat me like a child ed
i wont when you stop acting like one
mike grabs eds bare tits and twists
ed screams grabs mikes tits and twists
both of them howl in pain
mike and ed both still titty twisting look up
everyone in the store stares
they each let go force smiles
this isnt over
not even close
ed stomps into the dressing room rubbing his sore boobs
mike pulls out his iphone begins texting
the wonder bras stand by their lockers when their phones beep
party at my house nite
get the word out
the bras type away simultaneously hit send
hundreds of students
the beeps of hundreds of cell phones
cars line the street
a steady flow of kids stream towards the front door
music pounds from within
its a rager
kids raid the refrigerator throw food around
another kid sprays the room with the removable sink head
mike rushes in grabs the sink head from the kid
give me that
mike turns without thinking spraying all wonder bras in the face
the bras scream
mike replaces the nozzle
im so sorry
have you seen alex
the bras wipe themselves off grab mikes hands
dance with us
the bras drag a reluctant mike out of the kitchen and into party goers dance everywhere and on top of everything
the bras surround mike each girl grinding on him as if it were a competition
lauren takes mike by the face turns him towards her nambib bib ib that african country makes me horny
jamie spins mike towards her places his hands on her boobs perfect arent they
samantha pulls mike roughly by the hair twists him around which one of us is it gonna be
mike tries to squeeze out
the bras block him
the music changes
a remix version of hammers cant touch this blares
i thought you girls wanted to dance
mike breaks into the s hammer routine we saw from the first scene
the bras back up
party goers stop what theyre doing and watch
not sure whether to laugh or join in
and then the bras fall in
followed by others
the party just got hotter
maggie runs through the party and out the back
stan chases after her
mike inconspicuously hammer walks his way out of the mix and outside
stan corners maggie against the back wall
i was upset
but i need you to show me you love me
then well move in together
im with someone else now
whod be stupid enough
stan turns angrily toward mike as he approaches
partys over stan
youre out of here
whos gonna make me leave
i would but it smells like youve been drinking so ill let the cops do it
mike pulls out his phone
stan looks to maggie then back to mike laughs you can have the nun
she doesnt put out anyway
on second thought mike swings
stan ducks throws a giant uppercut
mikes eyes roll back in his head and we cut to black
the hostess shows ed and julie to their table by the window
ed wears his new gucci outfit
julies under dressed
there you are mr
put this towards your studies
ed hands the hostess a
julie rolls her eyes
when you asked me to get together to talk about mark this isnt what i envisioned
this isnt a date ed
are you insinuating that id use my sons misfortune just to go out with you
what kind of a father do you think i am
as long as were on the same page
a waiter approaches
would you care to see the wine bring us the petrus
the waiter nods leaves
youre going to love this wine
dollars a bottle
i dont drink
so tell me what you thinks going on with mark
its baffling really but i noticed hes been drinking a lot of diet ice tea lately
maybe hes gay
you didnt ask me here to talk about mark did you
do you like caviar
because if you do you have to try the almas
year old beluga
julie throws her napkin on the table
youre disgusting ed
you dont like beluga
you can get something else
im not some year old who you can impress with caviar and expensive wine
would the caviar and expensive wine impress you if you were on a yacht off monte carlo
i came here because im concerned about the wellbeing of your son but you dont care about mark
all youre concerned with is proving to me how wealthy you are
i do care about mike
whatever his name is
you know whats too bad ed
im sure when you were the guy the boys picked on and the girls ignored you were really sweet
but you thought becoming rich would solve all your problems
instead it made you just like them
i have to go
ed takes her wrist
im acting like an idiot
julie begrudgingly sits back down
act normal or im leaving
close on mikes face eyes shut
a hand gently strokes his head
mike stirs awake smiles eyes still closed i had the craziest dream
i was again and back in high school
it was horrible scarlet maggie o
mikes eyes pop open
wider reveals mike and maggie on the bed
mikes head rests on maggies lap
mike jumps off the bed scrambles to the other side of the room and behind a chair
maggie leaps off the bed
you wanna play
okay lets play
im the hungry lioness and youre a baby gazelle
maggie roars chases mike around the room
this is highly inappropriate and dysfunctional
listen to me maggie
im your father
maggie growls stalks mike around the bed
and ive been a bad bad girl daddy
maggie dives across the bed
mike dodges runs out the door
alex and nicole sit closely by a fire pit laughing
how about mrs
every time she rolls her rs she spits all over me
alex imitates mrs
nicole laughs places her hand on alexs leg
alex looks down at her hand then up at her both staring at one another
nicole closes her eyes moves in
alex moves in then freaks
he bounds out of his chair sprints inside leaving nicole hanging
a distraught alex pushes his way through the insanity
he finds mike running down the stairs
mike i blew it
i totally blew it
she wanted me to kiss her but i panicked
i didnt know if i should close my eyes or which way to turn my head or how much tongue im supposed to use slow down
have you ever kissed a girl before
not a real one
i used to practice on my dads playboys
how did you find
all you have to do is take her face in your hands gently like
mike places a hand gently on either side of alexs face
hold her still as you adjust your head close your eyes and kiss her
the rest happens naturally
a boy walks past sees mike romantically holding alexs face
that is so wrong
mike and alex quickly separate
what if i you know pitch a tent
if you feel it you know getting angry take a step back
now go get that kiss
alex takes a deep breath steps outside
a determined alex marches over to the seated nicole
nicole stands im sorry alex
i didnt mean to before she can finish alexs hands are on her face and his lips on hers
its as if time stands still
mike watches his sons magical first kiss
and when alex takes a step back mike laughs
mike pulls out his phone
mastr b room
mike rushes to the stairs
an angry maggie storms down them
mike races up
mike sprints down the hall throws open the door to find samantha jamie and lauren in the bed clothes on the floor
we decided not to make you choose
you can have all of us
the chance of a lifetime
a legend making moment
looks sadly at the bras girls if i was years younger id
probably only last seconds anyway
put your clothes back on
mike turns exits
on the way out we actually hear sniffling
was he crying
julie laughs hysterically
gods honest truth
i had the whole costume
i used to go everywhere dressed like a wizard
no wonder i didnt get a date all through high school
annnnd you think im the biggest nerd ever

the wizard they call marius
and who might you be fair maiden
free to be herself julie lets her hair down shakes it out
elf princess ariala of jamroar
they stare at each other incredibly turned on
ed screams check please
close on a heavy kid leans over the pool puking
mike beside him while kids cheer the heavy kid on

mike turns finds scarlet making her way through the crowd
mike rushes over to her
scarlet what are you doing here

its past his curfew and he wasnt picking up his phone

mike leads scarlet away from the pool
ed and julie drive through the upscale neighborhood
how did you get your hands on the th edition
thats not due out for another three years
i have two words for you
he steps on the gas
he fishtails around a corner
cars pack eds street and driveway
boys and girls trample the front lawn
one boy urinates in a flower bed
calm thyself marius
ill kill him
ed double parks the car jumps out
ed storms up the driveway
julie hurries after him
a kid spies julie calls out its ms
all the kids on the lawn scatter in different directions
ed and julie enter the crowded loud room
kids dance stomp around on the furniture
a furious ed screams
julie whistles loudly
the kids stop
this party is over
if you dont want to spend the next months in detention you will leave
the kids beeline for the door
ed stops a girl
do you know where mark freedman is
i think i saw him go outside
a slice of pizza falls from the ceiling onto eds head
the girl laughs exits
maggie enters weeds through the crowd bumps into the bras
have you seen mark
were looking for him too
maggie scowls heads for the back door
the bras chase
mike and scarlet hide behind the pool house peek around the corner spy on alex and nicole by the fire pit
alex is animated confident
hes like a totally different person
scarlet and mike step back by the pool sit on a lounge
its been so good for him to have you around
you have no idea
believe me i do
hes a great kid
and youre an amazing mother
im not so sure
i mean look at me
i showed up at a party to drag my son home
could i be any more embarrassing
and how many amazing mothers run their kids father off
hey you didnt run him off
dont blame yourself for his stupidity
i knew he was unhappy
i knew he hated his job
i shouldve been more supportive more sympathetic to what he was going through
he gave up a lot for me
thats bull shit
you maggie and alex are the best thing that ever happened to me
he was just too selfish to recognize it
at least thats how i see it
scarlet smiles thankfully at mike
maggie and the bras roam the backyard searching for mike
hes over there
by the pool
whos the ho
alex and nicole hand in hand stroll back towards the house when alex freezes whoa

scarlet places a hand over mikes
i have no idea why im telling you all this
theres just something so familiar
scarlet looks into mikes eyes
mike stares back
he loves her
mike leans in and ssssslap
mike falls off the chair
scarlet leaps up
what do you think youre doing
mike scrambles to his feet
scar just calm down
i have something to tell you but i need you to keep an open mind
can you do that for me
this conversation is over mark
im not mark
im not in the mood for games
its no game
scarlet winces as if dealt a blow what
why would you say that
its the truth

if you do ill have you arrested or better yet institutionalized
scarlet marches towards the house
mike on her heels pleading
let me explain scar
as she passes ed and julie
your son needs a shrink
scarlet storms off
before mike can protest pervert
maggie lights him up runs for the house
slap slap slap
the bras add theirs on the way out
alex and nicole march past
mike reaches for alexs arm
alex pulls it away
let me explain how could you do this to me
alex whisks nicole into the house
mike lowers his head
ed stomps over grabs mike
this place is a disaster
a kid pissed all over my english garden
what were you thinking
she hates me ed
ive ruined everything
mike runs for the house
julie looks quizzically to ed
who hates him
whats going on
ed shifts uncomfortably takes a deep breath
i dont quite know how to put this
try being honest
hes not really my son
i dont have a son
ed looks like hes about to cry
marks obviously having a crisis and you
you insensitive bastard you disown him
hed be better off with his mother in thailand
julie strides for the house
ed yells after her should i call you
all is normal
no signs of a party
ed knocks and knocks on mikes bedroom door
its been days
we hear a dragging sound then
ed turns the knob opens the door enters
mike climbs back into bed
ed waves at the air
it smells like jeffrey dahmers kitchen in here
ed pulls up the blinds opens the windows
a disheveled mike groans rolls away from the light
ed sits on the bed
are you alright
i really messed up
ive lost my family
thats not true
nothings ever truly lost
what about you and julie
sorry about the party
ill pay for any damages
dont worry about it
my spa guy got the last of the vomit out of the pool so were good
i dont mean to rub salt in your wounds but ed holds up the manila envelope of divorce papers
youre due in court in an hour
a look of determination comes over mikes face
the bmw roars out of the garage ed driving tears down the driveway fishtailing onto the street loses control rips across a neighbors lawn then back onto the road and
scarlet stands before the judge her right hand raised as shes sworn in
the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you god
scarlet sits beside her attorney
the judge eyes her papers
youve requested a divorce by the state of california citing irreconcilable differences
is this correct
yes your honor
is michael odonnell or his representative present
no your honor
then i take his absence as agreement to the orders of the divorce
youre not asking for alimony or child support
no your honor
eds bmw skids to a stop in front of the building
mike and ed bound out race up the court steps what exactly are we doing
i dont know
we just need to stop her from going through with it
a well thought out plan
the mother will have full custody of the children
the father will have visitation rights of one weekend a month
the doors burst open
all turn to see mike and ed storm down the aisle
i declare a mistrial on the grounds of insufficient evidence and sacco and vanzetti
scarlet can only shake her head
what are you
who are you
i am legal counsel for mike odonnell and i demand a stay of execution for this marriage your majesty
hes my husbands best friend
are you a lawyer best friend
no but i have been a defendant in numerous lawsuits so bailiff
get these out of my courtroom
the bailiff grabs mike and a yelling ed drags them toward the exit
mike wiggles free runs back to the front
i have a letter from mike odonnell
just let me read it
im sorry but if its okay your honor
id like to hear it
make it quick
mike digs into his pocket pulls out a piece of paper
thank you your honor
september th was the first time i saw you
you were reading the great gatsby and wearing a guns n roses t shirt
id never seen anything so perfect
i remember thinking i had to have you or id die
not in a psycho kinda way but in that beautiful innocent unaffected way that way only a year old kid can have
you whispered you loved me at the homecoming dance and i felt so peaceful and safe because i knew no matter what happened from that night on nothing could ever
be that bad because i had you
and then i grew up lost my way and blamed you for my failures
but i was never lost
id just forgotten the way life makes you forget as you grow older
and i never failed at anything because on that september day you said yes to me
and at that dance you said you loved me
and as i stand here
as i write this i want you to know if i dont have you ill die
not in a psycho way but in that beautiful innocent unaffected way only a year old kid can have
im hungry like the wolf
mike places the paper on the table looks over to scarlet
scarlet just stares at him tears streaming down her cheeks
alright son you have to go now
mike nods walks down the aisle and out the door
your honor sir
im in no shape
i need to postpone
a tearful scarlet starts to leave stops picks up mikes letter
directions to the courthouse
she looks back confused
a solemn mike stares out the window
ed turns the radio off
maybe it wasnt a spell of enlightenment
mike looks to ed
what are you talking about
according to the website once youve learned your lesson youd turn back
that speech shouldve broken the spell
enough with the magic crap ed
you know what this means
you need to let them go
you need to let them get on with their lives and you need to get on with yours
mike chokes back tears
because he knows ed is right
mike works on his laptop plugs his iphone into it
mike moves to the bed packs his falcons uniform into a duffel bag
mike unplugs the iphone types an email to scarlet i think this will help your business
best of luck mark mike hits send grabs his bag and exits
mike steps outside throws his duffel into the aston
ed exits the house
where you going
im moving on
see you at the game
mike climbs into the car pulls out of the driveway
scarlet sits at the kitchen table working on her laptop
the noise of an incoming email
she clicks over
scarlet reads mikes email then clicks on the link
a web site pops up
an empty gym
mike stands feet beyond the point line grabs balls from a hopper and rapidly shoots shoots shoots
coach harvey enters
hey freedman save some for the game
mike sinks one last jumper turns to the coach
just warming up coach
coach harvey hands mike a towel
son i havent seen anyone with your shooting ability in well in a long time
i called a couple college scouts i know
theyre coming to the game tonight
to watch you
if you have half the season i think youre capable of you can play anywhere you want
thats the plan coach
the rest of the falcons basketball team jogs out from the locker room followed by a photographer
round up jock straps
the team assembles in the middle of the court
alex moves away from mike
a player kneeling in front holds a sign flash
and with the flash we cut to a popular song rocks the gymnasium
cheerleaders dance on the sidelines
students and parents cheer wildly from the packed stands
julie gabs with a group of teachers
on one end of the court the falcons run a pass and shoot drill
on the opposite end a team in blue shoots around
mike sees scarlet and maggie enter
he smiles apologetically to them
both turn away climb the bleachers join nicole and the wonder bras
to scarlet i thought he was hanging out with alex to get to me not you
coach harvey claps loudly alright ladies bring it in
the falcons swarm the bench take their seats
mike takes a deep breath sits next to alex
alex looks down
i have nothing to say to you
i never meant to hurt you then whyd you kiss my mom
alex im your fa
i dont know
alex stands youre lucky i dont punch you out
alex moves down the line takes another seat
ed strides through the door spots julie makes his way over to her
julie can i talk to you
julie excuses herself from the teachers
what is it ed
ive seen a good friend of mine lose everything that means anything to him
and maybe well never be there but
i just really want to play d d with you
julie cant help but smile sizes ed up
you can raid my dungeon anytime
ill bring my long bow
a referee blows his whistle
remember boys winners get the girls
losers please themselves
mike and the falcons jog onto the court
mike takes his place for the jump ball
the crowd stomps cheers loudly
mike looks around the gymnasium
it almost seems to slow up
the sound deafening
he finds alex on the bench
his hopeful face
mike looks into the stands
maggie and scarlet
scarlet abruptly stands climbs back down the bleachers and exits the gym
the ref readies to toss the ball
mike takes a deep breath
and walks off the court
come back here
youre gonna get a delay of game
this cant be happening again
mike steps over to alex its your turn now
mike rushes off the court
as mike disappears into the tunnel we see the old janitor amongst the crowd
coach harvey turns to alex get off your butt odonnell
get in there
alex leaps off the bench
the tunnel is empty
crestfallen mike lowers his head
angle on scarlet as she appears at the far end of the tunnel
what took you so long
angle on mike and hes years old again bursting out of his uniform
the best choice i ever made was you
scarlet and mike walk towards one another picking up their pace the closer they get
how did this happ
mike wraps his arms around her
they lock lips
mike takes scarlets hand and as they walk out of the tunnel i think its best if we dont tell the kids about this
