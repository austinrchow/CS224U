by scott yagemann november rev
on a pair of black dexter penny loafers diligently pedaling an old schwinn mountain bike
adjust angle now to meet the bicyclist
hes african american
anywhere from to
wears wire rim glasses a fresh white oxford shirt creased slacks and a solid green tie
an unobtrusive figure at once familiar and yet undiscerning
the type youd pass on a sidewalk and never even notice
hes trevor garfield
adjust angle further now to reveal the upper promenade bike path and a dramatic view of lower manhattan behind him
morning sun glimmers off the trade center towers
trevors shadow skitters along the wooden path ft
above the east river
a fat briefcase strapped to the back of his bike rocks back and forth as he pumps the pedals
from above now a sweeping view of trevor alone on the bike path a speck suspended above a sea of rush hour traffic on the bridge below
a wrought iron train trestle covered with graffiti shakes as an el train roars overhead
trevor races parallel with it along atlantic avenue
every city block becomes more and more rundown
a cyclone fence frames the stalwart face of the old three story administration building
ubiquitous gray patches of paint fail to cover where taggers have most recently left their marks
the assistant principal a black man with a booming voice barks at late comers who are about to be tardy
clapping his hands lets go people
tardy lock out starts in one minute
get your butts in gear
one minute people
the assistant principal attention diverted doesnt even notice trevor as he enters on his bike and races down the sidewalk in front of the school
with all the prompting students still dont seem to be in much of a hurry
as trevor squeezes through the doorway past students being processed through card readers and metal detectors and turns down the main hall
with a glance over his shoulder trevor hops back onto his bike and pedals it down the middle of the corridor
straggling students either ignore him or look at him like hes insane
as trevor passes no ridin bikes in a hallway stoo pit
as trevor reaches the end of the main corridor
and steers his bike down the stairs
trevor coasts skillfully down the stairs and emerges onto the bottom floor of the school
he pedals away toward the other end of the corridor
a crowd of th graders loiter outside trevors room
seeing him coming they stir to life with a flurry of taunts
trevor chooses to face all dissension with a smile
as trevor hops off his bike and unlocks the classroom door he notices two lovers making out in the hallway
yuh late garfield
catching his breath no bell hasnt rung yet
okay lets get inside
as they file into the room morning morning
rise and shine
two students make passing comments
shaking his head you one crazy ass nigga g
a quarter stuck in one ear damn skippy
thank you for sharing auggie
provoking auggie auggie doggie
fuck you tywan
yer mamas a gangsta rapper
trevor offers a pleasant greeting to the two lovers
scuse me you two
this isnt the playboy channel
trevor enters the room but ducks his head back into the hall
walls are covered with assorted science posters
styrofoam nuclei dangle from the ceiling
trevor unstraps the fat briefcase from his bicycle and sets it on a metal stool next to his desk
enthusiastically lets get started
august and tywan you pass out the books
thank you gentlemen
auggie and tywan dont budge
whas up wit your car g
yer pinto blow up
the majority of students arent even paying attention
a group in the back is already starting a card game
good natured smile no i dont own a pinto tywan
addressing the class okay can i have everyones attention
no response but it doesnt phase trevor
he removes the front wheels from his bike
the purpose of the bicycle is to demonstrate the principle of centripetal force
thats the opposite of the force we studied yesterday which was
hoots and laughter
centripetal force is where the acceleration of a body moving in circular motion is directed toward its center by an opposing force thus creating momentum that constrains the body to
its circular path
like a gyroscope
sees nothing but yawns its better if i show you
here tywan you be my helper
tywan and auggie are busy talking in the corner
they still havent passed out the books
tywan solidly built like a rodin bronze saunters over
whad up g
to rest of class hey shut up
yall too damn loud man
class quiets but only marginally
i need you to demonstrate centripetal force
removes briefcase from stool here have a seat
tywan sits and trevor hands him the upside down bicycle
okay hold the bike steady with your knees
seat positioned against your chest
tywan glances over at auggie and starts to laugh
to auggie shut up foo
okay now crank the pedals and get that back wheel spinning about whas up wit dat
coaxing him along youll see
a skeptical tywan starts to crank the pedals but hes not pedaling hard enough
put some muscle into it
tywan cranks the pedals harder now
trevor back pedals over to the textbook shelf and randomly selects a physical science book but doesnt open it
a paper airplane sails past an oblivious tywan
he cranks harder and harder until hes sweating ham juice
now he impales trevor with a befuddled squint
incredulous whas up
i tol you you was crazy man
a thin smile of confidence from trevor now
now tilt the wheel to your right
tywan does and immediately the wheel pulls him to the right causing the stool to slowly spin on its axis
eyes wide like a little kid aw damn
lookit me auggie
trevor flickers a smile as tywans spinning starts to draw the attention of the rest of the class
now trevor refers to the physical science book in his hand
smile on his face immediately fades
insert physical science textbook
in magic marker
the large number has been scrawled across every page
trevor flips through the book
he checks the front page to see who it belongs to
juxtaposed to trevors distracted state the class is now focused on tywans achievement
attempting unison tywan tywan tywan
one of the fluorescent lights overhead flickers
the place is deserted except for a custodian who pushes a cresting wave of trash ahead of his broom
now trevor heads up the north stairwell at the far end of the corridor
he clutches the desecrated physical science book
a student slides down the banister past him
a puerto rican woman prods a group of gangbanger wanna bes
two of the teens hover over a sony walkman sharing the earphones
okay fellas off the table
put the walkman away
i said put it away
a th grade counselors office opens and a student emerges
trevor walks directly in
walter i need to speak with you
walter anglo is a disheveled middle aged counselor
he chews on an empty smoking pipe as he glances through a student cum cue mm
preoccupied im pretty busy right now garfield
what is it
trevor sets the book down on walters desk and nervously adjusts his glasses
could you open it please
walter opens the book
a weary look of disgust dont suppose this kid cares about our budget crisis
shuts the book have the textbook room charge him for the book
walter snaps the book shut and looks up at trevor
one eight seven is a penal code number for murder walter
means the same thing as t o s
terminate on the spot
piqued for chrissake i know what it stands for
look kid probably heard it in a rap song
doesnt mean anything
the book belongs to dennis broadway
hes a known gangster walter a five percenter
garfield if i had a dollar for every time a student threatened faculty
dont you think youre overreacting a little
suppressing trepidation did you tell dennis broadway he was getting a fail from me
stymied i have legal access to those files
hes a transfer from nixon high school isnt he
becoming defensive look im not obligated to track you down every time a transfer student comes through here
you want confidential information like that come look it up in his cum cue mm
trevor exhales a sigh of resignation
do you have him on a contract
if he gets through the semester without a fail then he gets to go back to nixon so what
and be with his homeboys
walters caught between a rock and a hard place
his instincts lean toward self preservation
so he blew his opportunity
now he has to learn to live with the consequences
i dont think this kids ready to deal with the consequences
i think he wants me dead
relax has nothin to do with you
i should have been told walter
hey im on your side garfield but my hands are tied
kid has a right to his privacy
know what your problem is
youre an idealist
whats wrong with that
you only see what you wanna see thats whats wrong
on one hand you think someones trying to kill you
on the other hand you actually believe kids are paying attention in your classes
trevor resigns himself to the fact that hes come to the wrong person for support
collecting himself never mind
its not a problem
an empty promise tell you what as soon as i get a chance ill summons the kid
trevors bemusement holds us
trevor retraces his steps back up the empty corridor as the passing bell rings
within seconds the corridor is teeming with teenagers
into slow motion now
maneuvering through the crowd to discover dennis broadway
about ten paces behind
his snoop dogg afro frames a gold earring and a pair of deep set eyes filled with vitriol
oblivious of dennis trevor presses on toward the north stairwell
various shots overhead and through crowd as the gap between dennis and trevor narrows
every facial expression every blink of an eye all magnified a hundred times
broadways right hand is wrapped in a dirty white handkerchief as he reaches into the front pocket of his baggie solos and pulls out a block of wood with a
ten penny nail imbedded in it
trevors heavy eyelids blink as he slowly glances up into a parabolic mirror on the wall
a silent paroxysmal terror registers on his face
in a parabolic mirror the blurred image of dennis broadway pushing hard toward a conclusion now
back to speed as dennis explodes forward body blocking trevor from behind pinning him against a wall and sending the textbook flying
he rams his weapon into trevors back
in a series of rapid fire cuts filtered sunlight shimmers off the sharpened nail as it slashes downward
a barrage of stabbing motions tearing at cloth and flesh
trevors backward flailing arms are ineffective in blocking the frenzied stabfest
downward slashing again and again
as quickly as it began its over
dennis broadway slams open an exit door and is gone
students scatter like cockroaches
an eerie stillness lingers
trevor garfield is lying on his back now in a pool of blood black plastic framed glasses in pieces on the floor lifeless arms spread out at his sides
his rheumy unblinking eyes stare upward into infinite space
breathing is the major focus of his concentration now as we slowly move in on his face
hold and now
its a tiny one bedroom house in the east san fernando valley
a chain link fence surrounds the perimeter and a large olive tree shades the neatly mowed front lawn
and in the back theres a wooden tool shed that borders a narrow alley
in the predawn light a terra cotta angel stands guard over a bookshelf
now the phone rings
a shape in the bed stirs
a desk lamp flickers on illuminating the phone
trevors hand reaches for the receiver
this is the sub unit
are you available for work
clearing his throat yes uh huh
theres a science class in the valley at john quincy adams
its a four day assignment
teachers name is eskander
we hear what god hears over the following
trevor hangs his head under a torrent of soothing water
ceremoniously he irons a shirt
and polishes his shoes a broad scar shows across the back of his hand
his pressed slacks and tie hang meticulously over a chair as he gets dressed
now jesus christ looks down on trevor from his crucifix on the bedroom wall
kneeling bedside if youre listening god please help me today
all i ask is a chance to do my job
tdo the job you put me here to do in the first place
prayerfully now please help me accept those things i cannot change
and give me strength to change those things i can
beat this is me trevor god
traffic bottle necks as students cross in front of cars and big yellow l
buses pull in
the green lawn is scattered with students about hispanic
compared to the scarred institutional look of roosevelt whitney the face of john quincy adams is unblemished
this is your own backyard not the inner city sagging pants dickies ben davis and oversized jackets county bens duke georgetown are represented
the different socio economic and ethnic groups stick with their own kind the ihps individual honors program the taggers the gangbangers the asians the armenians
anglo boy stevie littleton gets out of his moms lexus in the school parking lot and walks towards school
trevor sits behind the wheel of his rambler
watches a passing parade of students with detachment
trevor fat briefcase in hand crosses the front lawn
hes not the same trevor we met back in bedford stuvyesant
withdrawn guarded he manufactures a cautious smile at students in passing
trevor now approaches victor sifuentes a young plain clothes narc who intermittently wands students with a metal detector at the front doors
favor a kid now who wears a baseball cap with an emblem on the crown that says fucd
baseball cap give it up
the kid grudgingly reciprocates handing over his cap
stopping trevor now hold it please
trevor produces his blue employee card
im a substitute
pointing okay you want the main office straight ahead
check in with mrs
trevor wanders up the crowded corridor
along with his briefcase he now carries a sub folder that contains a homeroom roster lesson plans and seating charts
a sporadic row of teachers like weary sentinels stand outside their classrooms
teacher is an insipid woman in her mid forties
shes overweight and wears too much make up
im looking for bungalow
checks homeroom roster eighty six
pointing all the way out next to the parking lot
last bungalow on the left
fatalistic good luck
her comment weighs on him as he resumes his winding path through the bustle of students headed for first period
glancing through open doorways
observing the inner life of various classrooms in passing
sees students watch ing tv teacher ignores them
anglo male slouching behind his desk attempting to read a newspaper but distracted by an offstage commotion
erupting sit down
i come back there and youre gonna be sorry
on the opposite side of the corridor
we can hear ellen henrys voice before reaching her doorway
all brightness and light full of enthusiasm
like a buzzer times up eeeegghh
william you know this
cmon how do you find the pound sign
whats the fastest way
now we see her through the doorway
ellen henry teacher
shes thirty anglo and non tenured
at the front of the class ten students stand linked together arm in arm in a human chain
william sits behind a computer in the front row struggling to decipher the problem
playfully youre not thinking
a major clue how bout binary search
william remains puzzled
the chain of students delight in chiding him
the answer you split them
ellen attempts to bisect the impulsive chain of students with a double handed karate chop
fickle chain that they are they resist
amused very funny
now a slow motion fleeting moment as she catches trevors passing gaze and openly smiles at him
trevor rinses his face at the sink as victor sifuentes head speaks to him from above one of the heavily graffitied stalls in b
so who yuh here for
zipping up exiting aw man you got bungalow duty
on a meandering course merging with trevor now
increasing evidence of tagging and bands of wandering students indicate a higher degree of disorder the further one gets from the main office
from above now like algernon and his maze trevor negotiates his own path deeper and deeper into the configuration of bungalows
and trevors trepidation
eyes discerning every passerby
his pulse audibly races senses heightened
shifting into slow motion again
and the reverberating sound of a spray paint marble as trevor rounds a corner and comes face to face with three tag bangers concealing spray paint cans inside their oversized
one of the taggers locks eyes with trevor as he passes a slow premonitory burn
the tagger has a skin tight pelon hair cut and a string of black rosary beads around his neck
a barcode tattoo on the back of his neck identi fies benny
behind the bungalows adjacent the delivery gate
meet dave childress a forty something ditto head
the residual effects of a hangover linger as he sneaks a cigarette before first period
he wears a faded hawaiian shirt and huarache sandals
an old military tattoo emblazons his left forearm
as he crushes out his cigarette something catches his eye
thru a chain link fence we see a handful of cholo types loitering around the shed
as he approaches the fence
hey ese s
homeboys scatter in all directions some hop the chain link fence others scurry out a narrow gate behind the shed
childress weighs an amused smirk
now out of nowhere a gangbanger lurches from the shed buttoning his sagging dickies and tripping over his own feet
he scrambles out the back gate and is gone
childress curiosity piqued now enters the compound through a tear in the fence
as childress pokes his head inside he discovers
rita nartinez seventeen
a niobium belly ring piercing her navel
she pulls a dark blue sweat shirt on over her head
glances up at childress
masks her shame with a defiant smirk
behind the heavy eyeliner and baggy pants of a chola ritas really nothing more than a little lost girl
knowing full well what the hells going on here lil sister
trevor flicks on the lights exposing bare colorless walls and closed venetian blinds
his breathings slightly labored as he sets down his briefcase
his back faces the mob of students that trickle in now as he takes a surreptitious hit off an inhaler
almost instantly his breathing returns to normal
now he shuts his eyes and prepares to conjure up the dormant enthusiasm he used to have
takes a deep cathartic breath
now he digs a file folder out of his briefcase opens it selects a dispatch and approaches the blackboard
bell rings as he picks up a piece of chalk
first he writes his name in the corner of the blackboard
now he moves to the center of the blackboard and begins to write per the file folder in his hand
no one pays much attention
back still facing the class
before taking roll id like to prove a point
now one or two students begin to notice the indecipherable gibberish he is writing on the board
armenian a disparaging laugh farfie
cholo like whad up farfie
trevor mentally blocks out the salvo of grunts groans and expletives
with each subsequent stroke of the chalk he is exorcising his demons
its not important what
turning to face the class now
yuh wanna play yuh gotta stay
have a seat please
a handful of students take their seats
pacing now the point id like to make is this
anyone here can be a scientist
a grudging buzz of confusion
sotto puzzled whats he talking about
a scientist is like a detective
he investigates data
he scratches the surface of things he doesnt understand to see whats underneath
pointing to blackboard things like this
okay who wants to read
barsek the class clown breaks in
standing up ill do it
trevor quiets a harmless barrage of bart sit down and armenian power sucks
come on we dont need disrespect
let im do it
to barsek whats your name
a wisp of gratification flickers at the corner of trevors mouth
the following is read in fits and starts and accompanied by diminishing laughter and ridicule
glis was very frapper
she had denarpen farfies mardsen
she couldnt galp a giberter for farfie
instead she wharked to plimp a mardsen binky for him
okay anyone know what barsek just said
a unanimous no
trevor can see the light at the end of the tunnel now
hes back in the zone
you dont need to understand something to answer a few simple questions about it
every one of you is capable of decoding data
trevor writes question on the board
why was glis frapper
can anyone tell me
the asian girl into it now tentatively raises her hand
pointing at asian girl okay
asian girls pov as she studies the first two sentences on the board
slowly cautiously glis was frapper
she had denarpen farfies mardsen
understated thats right
you got it
reactions all around lets try another
trevor reads and writes question on the board
what did glis plimp
before trevor can finish writing the question an unidentified voice blurts out he plimped a ho
trevor grimaces shakes his head
now attempts to add the question mark at the end of the sentence but the chalk breaks causing dissension
searching blackboard ledge hold on hold on
wheres your teacher keep the chalk
in the desk
trevor hastily rifles through the teachers drawers
a startling discovery abruptly halts his search
closer now into a brown paper bag trevor has opened
inside the bag is a
off trevors narrowing gaze an offstage voice interrupts
can i help you
trevor lifts his head to see dave childress standing in the doorway of the bungalow
trevor shuts the desk drawer
you can hear a pin drop
childress piston chews a wad of gum as he approaches trevor
sorry im late
had to handle something
you a sub
puzzled i thought this was science
childress weighs a shit eating grin as he glances at trevors name on the board
this is dave childress american history
some students brave a laugh at trevors expense
dont know how to break it to you
glancing at trevors name again garfield
but this is bungalow
childress now places a patronizing hand on trevors shoulder and steers him toward the window blinds
see you zigged when you shoulda zagged
course its not your fault someone jacked the number off my door
keep askin garcia to fix it but all i get is nada
childress draws the blinds on one of the windows exposing another bungalow across the way
in complete disarray
students clutter the doorway as wads of paper intermittently zing past them
that mess over there thats eskanders
off trevors unflinching stare
the bungalow was originally designed for lab science glass encased cupboards a caged white lab rat on a side counter an by counter top island at the front of the
room including a built in sink and butane gas valve
students crowd the opened windows on the far side of the room
the chaotic atmosphere centers around one student
benny chacon the tagger we met earlier
trevors back to square one
he struggles with trepidation as he steps into the doorway of the bungalow and hesitates
a young black girl lakesia stewart stands near the doorway
she cradles a realistic looking e
baby education now and babies later
you our sub
trevor takes a peek at the doll
its not real
were studying teen parenting in home ec
its computerized so it cries and shit
crowd at the windows begins to disperse now finding their seats except for benny who doesnt budge
trevor approaches gazes out the window eyes sizing up the situation
scattered on the blacktop between the parking lot fence and bungalow are science textbooks
addressing benny without prejudging you know how the books got outside
benny plays with the black rosary around his neck
responds with mock ignorance
no speaky engless
class erupts with laughter
a wad of paper sails past trevor and out the window
you speak spanish mister
whas yer name
you speak spanish mister g
as trevor ignores the question eh g
know what dat means when a homeboy calls you g
dat means gangster homes
you a gangster maestro
no im not a gangster
beat would you please do me a favor and pick up the books
righteous indignation andate a la mierda
more laughs i aint pickin dat shit up
you go pick it up
benny now finds a seat
trevor follows him
whats your name
dont you recognize me
trevor refers to the seating chart inside the sub folder in his hand but bennys not sitting in his proper seat
benny indicates a by monitoring device strapped to his ankle
im already on house arrest homes
aint nothin more you can do to me
suddenly three students across from benny the other three taggers we saw earlier cesar sanchez stevie littleton and paco stand with bold impunity
cesar has a buzz cut stevies an anglo speed freak with a runny nose and a bleached one clip haircut roots showing and paco a latino
sit down please
cesar stevie and paco ignore trevor and walk out of the bungalow
their departure is accompanied by a tumultuous outburst of catcalls and whistles
peeking bennys hold card mr
g those guys that jus walked out arent even in here this period
pointing to benny and this fools name is benny chacon
whirls in his seat shut yer mouth hood rat
school girl bitch
benny turns his wrath on trevor now
hey you aint no real teacher
fool youre nothin but a sub
tink yer so cool
you mus be mr
trevor closes the sub folder and just looks at benny
a cool curiosity why do you wear a rosary
reacting aint none a yer damn business
to put god on me okay
why dont you jus go sit down and read yer newspaper
wanna be mother fucker
trevor just stands there studies benny
a palpable beat
are you done
there is dead silence as benny stares trevor straight in the eye
trevor stares right back
jus gimme a referral
trevor turns and calmly walks back to the island counter searches and finds a referral slip in one of the drawers fills it out
cool deliberation for future reference anyone who disrupts a class or in any way infringes on the rights of others to get an education is subject to disciplinary action
beat when im here ladies and gentlemen i expect to be treated decently
walks back to benny hopefully in an atmosphere of mutual respect
this classroom is our sanctuary yours and mine
handing benny the referral for your information i am a real teacher
whatever you say opie
benny has a smirk on his face as he sashays past trevor with the referral slip
okay who would like to help me pick up the books
benny a self aggrandized exit crumbles the referral slip and tosses it at trevor hitting him square in the back
like a reflex trevor whirls and ducks
students laugh at his heightened reaction
we see kids at an armored coke machine
pan off machine to see kids at lunch
trevor sits by himself lost in stirring a bowl of soup
he observes a talkative clique of teachers at the far end of the table including teacher
now dave childress sits down disrupting trevors solitude
how goes the battle garfield
dave bites into a messy sandwich as he skims the front page of a newspaper that someone left behind
djuh get that binky marsden farfied
trevor doesnt say a word
just keeps stirring his soup now notices ellen henry as she enters and joins the food line
know what i think
i think that chacon punks the one who opened your bungalow this morning
another bite eskander doesnt know how to lock a window
the cashier armenian girl is one of ellens students
as ellen pays for a sandwich
come by the lab after school well work on it
want some advice
trevor slides dave a glance
first homeboy that gives you the slightest bit of trouble
send um tuh larry hyland
hes their counselor
right off the bat yuh have to sacrifice one
let um know whos boss
show some balls
as trevor nods and dont look for support from the administration
most of em havent been in a classroom in ten years
they dont know shit
i got tenure and im still out here in the damn bungalows
i should be in the a building with a nice air conditioned room
sarcastically you met garcia yet
trevor shakes his head as ellen henry takes the empty seat at the end of the table smiles at trevor
extends a hand ellen henry computer science
as they shake right in front of childress face he cant help noticing the mean scar on the back of trevors hand
nice scar yuh got there
theres something familiar about this sub
ever sub here before
curiously what about permanent
i taught seven years in the bedford stuyvesant section of brooklyn
roosevelt whitney high school
didnt some teacher get stabbed to death there last year
actually he survived
no it was on sixty minutes
some gangbanger stabbed this guy with a ten penny nail like a dozen times in a hallway and
childress looks from trevor silently stirring his soup down to the scar again
and now it hits him
jesus christ youre him
it was you
awestruck holy shit garfield
when was that
december before last
no it was fall
im sittin here givin advice to a man with a purple heart
inexplicably she gets up and leaves
as trevor watches ellen go childress slides closer to him
sotto lemme tell yuh somethin
in my book youre a fuckin hero
trevor slides a look back to dave as he eats his soup
getting stabbed doesnt make me a hero
disregards trevors comment so whatd they give the kid
they put im upstate in a facility until his twenty first birthday
they shoulda caned the bastard
like they did that kid in singapore
recollecting president of singapore had a few choice words
use to have it memorized
he said something like when a state of increasing disorder and defiance cannot be checked by the rules
then new and sometimes drastic rules have to be forged to maintain order
slides trevor a glance the alternative is to surrender order to chaos and anarchy
so why do you still teach
same reason as you garfield for the paycheck
the windows and blinds are shut now
is inching toward the top of the hour
closing their books and loading their knapsacks the students talk and pay more attention to the inexorable march of time than to trevor writing on an overhead projector
okay someone tell me the difference between the central nervous system and the lymphatic system
rita nartinez the chola from the utility shed sits near the front of the class
she wears her usual heavy eyeliner and a new nose ring
g you gotta nice butt
rita enjoys the attention
trevor turns and looks at her squarely
you seem to be an expert on anatomy miss checks roster nartinez
central nervous system and lymphatic system
whats the difference
trevor doesnt expect anything remotely close to the right answer
its like the central nervous system thats your brain and spinal cord and the lymphatic system thats the stuff in your blood that fights diseases
trevor looks up at her
trevor notices cesar sanchez writing on his desk
stevie cranes his neck to observe
cesar throws back his head and jerks both hands from his desk top
trevor walks up the aisle
you writing on your desk
coolly you see anything in my hands
displaying his empty palms i dont think so
trevor looks down at the tagging on cesars desktop
in one corner are the letters k o s and below that the word cartoon
k o s whats that
that a tagging crew
cesar shrugs with a big grin
is that you cesar
off no response k o s has something to do with your friend benny
youre a sucker
k o s stands for kappin off suckers
dont disrespect my homeboy benny
he dont like it
he dont like you
trevor dismisses cesars comments
do me a favor cesar
go get a paper towel from the counter and wipe off your desk
beat and mr
littleton please oblige me and turn that tagger shirt inside out
stevie wears a fusion t shirt emblazoned with a giant spray can
refusing hyland said it was okay sucker
neither of them budge
now the bell rings and the classroom empties in a matter of seconds
cesar stares daggers at trevor as he exits
rita hangs back the last one to leave
she doesnt want anyone to see her talking to trevor
self conscious dont pay no attention to them
they jus tryin tuh fuck wit you mr
i mean play wit you
beat sorry i said you had a nice ass
a pensive beat apology accepted
in her own defense i aint no school girl
god forbid anyone should think that
rita flickers an awkward smile turns and exits
the class empties and trevor is left staring at the empty desks where benny and cesar sat
whack trevors reverie is broken by a basketball smashing against the side of the bungalow
a group of boys grin mischieviously at the reaction they get from trevor
continue smashing the ball against bungalows
shifts his gaze from them to the venetian blinds framing the window
to the clock over his desk
as they open revealing the clock and just as suddenly close
tilt down to find trevor working the cords to the blinds hes rigged over the timeplace
a faint knock breaks his spell as he glances up to discover ellen henry standing in the open doorway
may i come in
points at her ellen
pointing back trevor
he sees her looking quizzically at the blinds hes rigged over the clock
explaining im making time a reward instead of a distraction
impressed ellen peruses the room now with a benign gaze
listen i wanted to apologize for jumping up like i did at lunch
i was just feeling a little weird
for what its worth dave childress thinks you walk on water
is that a good thing
ellen flickers a grin point taken
i think it takes a lot of courage to go back into a classroom after something like that
not if the only thing you ever wanted to do was teach
smiles now you see theres our predicament
whack the noise pulls ellens attention out the window where the boys play a rough game of basketball
i assume youve met benny chacon
absently last week benny and his tagging crew had ms
eskander pinned in the corner over there
pointing shes seven months pregnant and hes tormenting her with a broom handle
can i help you with those
trevor is trying to put some books on an upper shelf but hes having trouble raising his arm high enough
ellen sees hes in pain
she watches him struggle then breaks the awkwardness
so anyway gloria kicks benny
and if the district construes it as assault and battery on a student shes gone
theyd do that
in a heart beat
shes non tenured they dont want to get sued
with resignation dont be surprised if she files for stress leave by the end of the week
too bad too
shes a good teacher
outside the kids continue to play
the late sun makes their violent shadows swarm over ellen
can i ask you a personal question
trevor glances up
heres what she really wants to know
tentatively now whyd that kid attack you
because i flunked him
sobered is there any way you can see something like that coming
when they say they wanna kill you youd best take it serious
this kid was an o
opportunity transfer but nobody told me until it was too late
did you know bennys an o
in less than a year hes been convicted of felony assault and suspended twice
i even testified against him as a character witness
now i get to see him every day in homeroom
im stuck with him
condition of his probation is that he stay in school
you talk to the principal
three weeks ago garcia calls bennys mother in for a conference but she refuses to show up
shes afraid theyll deport her because shes illegal
so she contacts the a
and some attorney tells her she doesnt have to come in
still cant believe garcia got cold feet and dropped the whole thing
fear building this kids threatening me and all hes worried about is a lawsuit
intent now whatd benny say to you
tears involuntarily well up in ellens eyes
hold for an awkward moment as she collects herself
that he wanted to hurt me
does he know where you live
i think so
someones been phoning me at night and hanging up
two weeks ago my car was broken into
and last friday i think he was inside my house
but i cant prove it
the shadows of the basketball players rage inside the bungalow
bottom lip quivers i dont know what to do
you can quit
off trevors severe gaze
trace the cold underbelly of the overpass
the glare of oncoming headlights flash overhead as we discover a tagging wall
the wall is completely covered with graffiti
the centerpiece of the wall is a by multi color placa that reads
angling to discover an anglo tagger now as he defaces the s in k o s covering it with his own piece
suddenly the lone tagger feels a presence at his back
now slowly turns to see
benny cesar and paco
benny lights a blunt illuminating his face
passes it to cesar
do i know you
indicates tagging you should
youre fuckin with my piece puto
nervously you from k
cesar and paco burst into hysterical laughter which only manages to get benny piqued
panicking look i didnt mean nothin
lemme fix it
i can fix it
cesar and paco laugh harder
to cesar eh shut up mojado
to tagger now dont mess wit me whiteboy
ill cap yer ass
he pulls a
automatic out of his pocket
brandishes it at cesar and paco
i said shut up
shut the fuck up
a beeper hooked on bennys pants pocket beeps
benny shuts it off
the tagger sees his opportunity and makes a break for it
without a second thought benny shoots him in the leg
tagger crumbles to the ground
bennys really pissed now
checks his beepers glow in the dark face for the message
reacting to message i dont have no time to put up wit dis shit
cesar and paco attempt to subdue their laughter but fail
you think its funny
benny lifts a pant leg
indicates his ankle monitor with the barrel of his gun
i dont call my p
in minutes im fucked
venting rage benny walks up the wounded tagger and starts shooting one hand high near his face shooting downward
now he kisses the crucifix on his rosary like a sick distorted affectation
dis is k
cesar and paco laugh even harder now falling all over each other
benny storms off
he marches past a street lamp and is swallowed up by the night
subject camera following benny
oblivious that hes being followed benny walks at a steady pace
as we continue gaining ground on him a sound upcut of trevor calling roll transports us to
amid unresponsive cross talk sergio arrellano
chiming in bennys not here
trevor gazes opaquely at bennys empty seat
i think he went awol mr
an eight year old hispanic kid pulls a red flexi flyer wagon laden with pop bottles and aluminum cans across weeds and cracked earth
he suddenly stops and stares at something in the weeds
snatches it up studies it and tosses it with everything else
slowly moving in on the wagon now
thru a thin shroud of dust as it bangs and bumps along
even closer now on the last retrieved article
its bennys ankle monitor
trevor emerges from assistant principal fords office and walks up the empty corridor without breaking stride
trevor retraces his steps back to the door of ellens plant filled personalized computer lab
over the clacking of computer keys
quietly eskander filed for stress leave
they want me to finish out the semester
with humility its only til the end of the year
listen i never thanked you for letting me cry on your shoulder
trevor flickers a conciliatory nod now he averts his eyes
digressing now hey have you seen benny lately
as trevor shrugs ford told me he hasnt phoned his p
in four days
weighs guilt whispering you know what they say
be careful what you pray for
dont get me wrong bennys made my life a living hell
i even moved back in with my mother because of him
i love my mother but if i eat one more dinner off a tv tray or watch one more rerun of wheel of fortune i think ill lose my fucking
now an egg timer rings o
on ellens desk
back into the classroom
to class times up
everyone stop working
realizing now that all the clacking computer keys have stopped moments ago
all eyes are fixed on ellen and trevor
big knowing grins all around
balmy and still
on bug zapper above garage a churning slow motion swarm of bugs repeatedly throw themselves headlong into the light
music plays faintly on the stereo
numerous artifacts occupy the bookshelves
a primitive african masai bow with two arrows is mounted on a wall
trevor tie loosened
ellen in nylon stocking feet leaning back against a couch
on the coffee table before them are dirty dishes and half full wine glasses
trevors lost in a thin introspective smile
breaks the silence so you have a wife hiding in a closet somewhere
smile widens no
dont you ever get lonely
trevor considers the question
theres this passage in gods lonely man by thomas wolfe where he says
the whole conviction of my life rests upon the belief that loneliness is the central and inevitable fact of human existence
i believe that
god thats depressing
they both laugh
my new york mentality
beat its not always easy looking on the bright side
especially after spending a year in and out of a hospital i would guess
actually that wasnt the toughest part its the robbery thats been hardest to recover from
didnt know about this whatd they steal
my old unguarded self
i resent that
i want them back
he offers a smile
ellen returns it
theyre still there
everybody around me seems to have given up
theyre all so beaten down
but youre different
you refuse to be beaten
so do you
ellen fills her glass
remember the last time a student surprised you
you mean where a light goes on
where the kid surpasses all your expectations
so few you can actually get through to
thinks that would have to be daniel terrazas
this was last year sometime
kid was failing miserably but he was the best salsa dancer in the whole school
brightens slightly uh oh
so i made im a deal
tutoring in exchange for salsa lessons
he was a perfect gentleman
dryly male teachers cant do things like that
they get arrested
yep double standard
by the way did you know cesar sanchez was special ed
as trevor shakes his head yep he never shouldve been mainstreamed
says hes l
but he acts more like s
severely emotionally disturbed
then ellen gets up wine glass balanced in her left hand
come on garfield on your feet
lemme teach you how to salsa
resisting no no im no good at that
ellen spins the tuner on the stereo to a latin station and practically yanks trevor to his feet
dont play shy with me homeboy
trevor grimaces awkwardly relinquishes as ellen walks him through it
still holding wine glass thats it
okay follow me
it starts on the one
step forward with your left foot
change weight on two
and three feet back together
now do the same in reverse starting with your right foot
talks their way through one two three
one two three
up to speed now
technically hes got it he just needs to loosen up
ellen suppresses a gleeful snicker
now trevor attempts to cut loose
he spins ellen once into a tango step one two three
now an awkward dip causing her glass to spill wine down the back of his shirt
horrified giggling oh my god
oh no im so sorry
self conscious its alright
he dashes toward the hallway bathroom
can i help
grab the baking soda outta the fridge
in a flurry ellen rushes into the kitchen
flips on the kitchen light jerks open the refrigerator and locates the baking soda
following now as she moves steadily from the kitchen to the hallway bathroom
as ellen steps into the doorway and lets out a startled gasp dropping the box of baking soda
trevor is bent over scrubbing his shirt in the sink
his bare back and shoulders are scattered with brutal knife scars
a tract house in the central san fernando valley
trevors rambler is parked at the curb
the house is dark except for a porch light
trevor and ellen are greeted by ellens golden retriever jack whos chained to the front porch
jack whimpers ready to bark
dont start barking jack
petting him hey there boy
youre a good dog
yes you are
jack nuzzles up to trevor tail wagging furiously no barking
now trevor stands and faces ellen
sorry for reacting the way i did back there
thats how most people react
didnt scare me
it just surprised me
thanks for dinner
i had a good time
trevor struggles with the urge to kiss her good night
they look at each other timidly for a moment
now he moves to kiss her and she inadvertently adjusts her stance
the result is a kiss that doesnt quite hit her mouth
its an awkward moment
ellen feels horrible for him desperately picks up a strange little plant by her feet
you need a little life in that place of yours
trevor takes it smiles thanks
turns and starts toward his car
a half wave night
in the moonlit darkness
trevors abandoned bed
the sheets are twisted and damp
we tilt up to see a digital clock at bedside reading am and trevors sweat panted figure moving down the hall in b
madly pedaling toward us on a bike
he wears running shoes shorts and a morehouse college sweat shirt and his face is contorted from the effort
he wipes sweat from his head takes a gasping hit from his inhaler as camera cranes up to reveal trevor on a stationary bike in the back yard of his
house rapidly going nowhere
his sleepless night continues
planted at his desk
trevor corrects a stack of science papers like a fervent prayer
sun peeks through the window above his desk
then burning out to white
shimmering in heat waves
a single fan stirs the air
amidst growing disorder trevor stands behind the front counter
agenda is written on the overhead as he flips through pages of a physical science text book
ritas out of her seat feeding the caged white lab rat
cesar with sunglasses and typical disregard holds court in the back of the room
he and stevie are high
trevor eyes them finds what he was looking for in the book
addressing class since some of you seem to have an interest in anesthetics ive prepared a little demonstration
glances over at rita now
checks the wall clock
rita bring your friend in the cage over here please
bringing the cage over
his names snowball
like dat lil pig dude from animal farm
coolly impressed youve read animal farm
above the din schoolgirl
snapping a look shut up cesar
you read animal farm cesar
no but i fucked a sheep
stevie and paco love it
cesar come up here
gesturing i want you to have a front row seat for this
surprisingly cesar does what hes told as trevor removes an old pocket watch from his briefcase and sets it next to snowballs cage
and remove the lokes
cesar removes his dark glasses
his eyes are bloodshot and vapid
why your eyes so red
lying mus be pink eye sir
eyes trevors pocket watch nice watch homes
can i have it
disregarding cesar trevor opens a drawer and removes two latex surgical gloves from a cardboard box
he puts on the gloves and selects a petri dish from another drawer
pointing rita would you bring me a sugar cube from the shelf over there
trevor now removes a small amber bottle with an eye dropper top from his briefcase
the class starts to settle down now as trevor pre measures water in a pipette and adds it to the petri dish
referring to text cesar read youngs rule for us
at the top
like its above him i aint gonna read dat shit
rita give cesar your book
let im read
rita places her book on cesars desk
jeers from the class come on read
hurry up cesar
prompting him youngs rule
rita points to the passage in the book
cesar slaps her hand
touch her again cesar and youll answer to me personally
rita knits her eyebrows at trevor
you like her mr
shrinking shut up
genuinely settle down everyone
we all have to learn how to forgive and get along
cmon cesar read
at first cesar doesnt budge
now grudgingly he looks down at the book
attempting to read youngs rule
cesar heaves the book across the room class erupts refer im send im tuh hyland
trevor walks over and picks up the book
class now settles
watches trevor closely to see what hes going to do
trevor gazes at cesar
i say everyone deserves another chance
whadda you say cesar
cesar knits his eyebrows puzzled
now trevor walks over and sets the textbook down in front of rita
rita would you please read youngs rule for me
youngs rule formulates proper dosage levels for children and adolescents
resume the lesson now
trevor indicates the amber bottle
in the brown bottle i have a prescription for liquid demeral
whered that come from sir
cesar grudgingly watches as trevor places a measured drop of the liquid demeral into the petri dish and stirs the solution
demeral is a morphine sulphate
and is soluble in water
using the pipette trevor administers two drops of the demeral and water solution to the sugar cube which he has placed inside snowballs cage
as snowball eats the sugar cube
youngs rule says divide the age of the patient by the patients age plus twelve giving us the fraction of the adult dosage suitable for the patient
in snowballs case ive calculated the dosage necessary to tranquilize a one year old child
then further divided that fraction by based on his weight to arrive at
having eaten most of the sugar cube snowball is rendered unconscious
dont worry hell be back to normal in exactly minutes
trevor peers at his pocket watch
the hour and minute hands read
hold as we
trevors pocket watch now reads
he shoulda woke up by now
snowball isnt moving
hold for an uncomfortably long moment on the class clustered around trevors desk
the class for once is completely silent
beads of perspiration form on trevors upper lip as he resolutely watches the sleeping rat
accusatory you just caught a murder case homes
now snowball begins to stir and the class reacts with scattered applause
a thin smile flickers across trevors face
as the bell rings
okay anyone who didnt finish answering the questions on finish them for homework
as students head for the doors he pulls off his latex gloves and looks for his pocket watch
but its gone
hold it cesar
cesar and stevie are almost out the door
wheres my watch
urgently hey i gotta go
i aint got no watch
empty your pockets both of you
want me to break it down to you
i gotta catch a bus
cesar heads out the door
trevor locks bungalow picks up his briefcase and along with the rest of the foot traffic heads in the direction of the a building
as trevor rounds a corner and runs smack into ellen on the opposite side of a chain link fence
making excuses sorry
im trying to catch hyland before he leaves
trevor keeps moving
ive been meaning to come by your room
keeping it light its almost been a week
my guess is youre avoiding me
trevors tongue tied
now he removes the proventil inhaler from his pocket take an innocuous hit
trevor nods sustains an awkward smile
has nothing to do with you ellen
hard for me
a struggle fighting against his true feelings
pretty much been like that since
you know my accident
has nothing to do with you
is it because im white
trevor stares into her eyes a soulful searching gaze
now he averts a self conscious look
we can still be friends
just dont pull away
trevor just looks at her
nods somewhat bewildered
back to lighter note now can i ask you a favor
after youre done with hyland can you give me a ride to my car
its at the mechanics about five or six blocks up lankershim
if you cant its okay i can walk
a little embarrassed i think i can manage that
victor sifuentes approaches now
que paso victor
into walkie talkie base three to base one
as their paths converge and they stop face to face
garcia would like to speak with you in his office
off trevors puzzled look
a wall air conditioner
blows on stevie and cesars sweaty backs
trevor enters shirt equally drenched in sweat
the dead silence is like that of a courtroom
garcia late forties drawn sits behind his desk
hyland stands in the outer office behind a glass partition head lowered
hyland flashes trevor a defeated smile as we
trevor coolly deciphers the situation
garcia reaches down switches on a portable tape recorder
you dont mind if i tape record our conversation
matter of record
hyland of course you know mr
trevor weighs the situation
am i being questioned
sanchez and mr
littleton tell me youve accused them of stealing your watch
if thats the case i need to address the accusation
for the record i primarily suspect mr
although i wouldnt be surprised if stevie was an accomplice
glances over at cesar and stevie beginning of sixth period cesar admired the watch
i believe his exact words were can i have it
looks back to garcia either way id like my watch back
when i asked him to empty his pockets cesar refused
is that true mr
he never asked me nothin like that
i dont go round taxing no teachers
with fervor now cesar turns his pockets inside out emptying the contents house keys and two dollars in change onto garcias desk
i aint got no watch man
littleton may we see your pockets too
stevie empties his pockets now
nothing but a twenty dollar bill and an empty pack of marlboros
trevor just stares at him
last try id like a locker search please
garcia hesitates now looks to cesar and stevie
youre excused gentlemen
take your things
the boys collect their belongings off garcias desk and shoot looks at trevor as they exit
now garcia turns back to trevor
unflinching pragmatism let me try and explain something
i try and think of our students here at john quincy adams like theyre my clients
i cant accuse anybody just on your hunches
i need more than that
i need facts
looking at hyland i wont have another law suit like we did with that blackwell case
now to trevor boys mother spent that she couldnt afford on new clothes for her son
unfortunately we considered the clothing gang attire and sent the boy home
that cost the district a quarter of a million dollars
beat so i want you to be straight with me mr
did you physically see cesar take your watch
no i didnt
do you have any witnesses who saw him take it
unless theres reasonable cause to show that cesar or mr
littleton took your watch then i cant authorize a locker search
any concerns regarding my decision you can look up in the handbook
of the education code
to garcia that was my grandfathers watch
cant you see what theyre doing
werent you ever a teacher
afraid i never had the privilege
teaching and being a principal dont necessarily go hand in hand mr
off trevors defeated gaze
as trevor and hyland emerge from garcias office and walk steadily up the empty corridor
sotto is it me or is garcia a real asshole
trevor doesnt respond lost in thought
ive been thinking about videotaping my classes
yeah well heres some free advice
cover your ass
trevor slides him a glance
they stop in front of hylands office door
he unlocks the door with a key
if garcia asks your main purpose is to observe you not the students
excuse me i mean his clients
phone rings as they enter
some gangbanger might think were violating his civil rights
trevor weighs it as hyland picks up the phone
into phone yeah
signals trevor to take a seat
into phone sorry iris
intercut trevor as his eyes idly fix on an index card box on hylands desk labeled locker combinations
hyland hangs up
to trevor yuh have a minute
wanna talk to you about our discipline committee
gotta run up to the office real quick first
trevor shifts his gaze back to hyland
yeah fine go ahead
hyland rushes out and trevor glances back at the index box
now he reaches over and carefully opens the small tin box
methodically now he flips through the file cards until he finds cesar sanchezs locker combination
trevors eyes scanning the information on the locker combination card
trevors rambler with ellen in the passenger seat stops at a large intersection
i have to fly up there for a computer conference
day after tomorrow
as trevor gets distracted by something he sees
never been to san francisco
at a right angle to lankershim down magnolia blvd
rita nartinez sits alone on a bus stop bench
oh you should go sometime trevor
i think youd like it
its only an hour by air
maybe five or six by car
completely different attitude from l
much more like a real city
like chicago or new york
as ellen continues talking we see a lowered blue nissan mini truck with matching shell pull up next to the bus stop
a cholo from the utility shed hangs out the passenger window and taunts rita
rita immediately stands and walks back down magnolia
the mini truck follows her in reverse
rita halts and begins ranting at the cholo waving her arms all around
now she stomps away and the mini truck drives away with a lurch
only problem is i hate to leave jack with my mother for any extended period of time
im afraid shell forget to feed him and hell starve to death
intercut trevors distracted gaze
if you want ill take care of jack
i cant ask you to do that
straight at ellen now sure you can
trevors conference period
he stands atop a ladder in the front of the room drilling holes in the wall for a jerry rigged camera mount
as he climbs down rita enters
paces back and forth wringing a clenched spiral notebook english comp
essay tucked inside
continues working arent you supposed to be at p
rants kicks a desk sunland boyz gettin crazy ol ladys
fuck dis being down shit
i wanna do somethin wit my life
a polaroid photo drops out of her notebook
trevor reaches down and scoops it up
a young year old cholo dressed in gang colors laid out in an open casket
now as he hands the photo back to rita
you know this guy
rita takes the photo back
she doesnt want to talk about it
unravels now begins to cry gotta make j c next year
i aint never gonna get up outta here
rita slow down
dat bitch quinn im onna sue her ass
swear tuh god
calm down a second
rita collapses into a desk
whats she teach
shes failin me
trevor tentatively picks up ritas essay branded with a big red f and begins reading it
bitch say i dont talk right
trevor scrutinizes her with a glance
now back to ritas essay
she hates me
shes racist against me
trevor sets the essay down on ritas desk
regards her with genuine candor
just cause youre a latina doesnt mean everyones racist against you
prideful hey im a la raza prof eh
just stop blaming everyone else
youre too smart for that
as ritas rocked back and every mistake in that essay is fixable okay
so relax its not the end of the world
rita collects herself wipes the streaks of mascara running down her cheeks with her sleeve
trevor studies her for a moment
points to counter tissues are in the first drawer
rita pulls herself together and walks over to the island counter
innocuously how come you always wear so much makeup
wounded to make me pretty
frankly you dont need it
she grabs a handful of tissues dabs at her smeared mascara
now her hair falls forward exposing the back of her neck
and a tattoo that reads puppet in a scrawling signature
she tosses her hair back and it disappears
slightest bit probative that your name
he indicates the back of her neck
with fervor and frustration its a gang thing
but im kickin dat shit
jus cuz i look down for my neighborhood dont mean im stupit
i know youre not
she inserts her failed essay inside the rolled up spiral notebook
offers the ideas in your essay arent the problem rita
its your punctuation and grammar
beat they need work
am i lying
as rita shrugs if you want help im here for you
tentatively now i dunno
have to be in the library after school
shaking her head somebody could see us
all right then ill come to your house
spontaneous and decisive no
you name the place
the passing bell for th period rings
off ritas torn gaze
fully mounted now on the wall above the blackboard
every eye in the class is riveted on the camera
settle on cesar and stevie seated in the back of the bungalow
off their malignant stares
grumbling dog you invadin my privacy
remaining calm cesar would you come up here please
leveling a hard look cesar swaggers up to the island counter
rita watches a bated gaze from her seat
trevor motions for him to come around behind the counter
now trevor removes his grandfathers pocket watch from his briefcase and furtively dangles it for cesar to see
calmly since you were so concerned i though you might like to know
i found my watch
cesar glares at the watch looks up at the video camera
you broke into my locker
dats a serious felony prof eh
you caught a case for sure now
whadda yuh propose to do cesar
as cesar weighs it whadda yuh gonna tell im
that i broke into your locker to steal back the watch you denied taking
i dont think so
id say were even now wouldnt you cesar
no id say were just getting started ese
cesar walks out
trevor smiles innocuously
at a stalemate now
you can hear a pin drop
suddenly the cries of an e
baby break the palpable tension
trevors rambler is parked out front
a stilted rita planted on the couch
wearing less makeup than usual
her notebook and pens are laid out on the coffee table along with an old english grammar textbook
trevor stands in the kitchen doorway
want something to drink
we have coke fanta or sprite
self consciously cokes awright
off trevors mollifying nod
a moment of self examination as he pours a glass of coke for rita
to rita offstage want you to know youre not the only one risking a reputation here
normally i dont tutor students at my house
adds ice cubes rita maybe you can clear something up
can you explain to me what machismo is all about
cuz this whole respect code of honor thing baffles me
as trevor approaches the couch eyes focused on ritas soda
preoccupied ask yourself this question
is pride really that important
now he looks up and freezes
quickly turns away
rita lying on the couch completely naked
not sexual in the least
more like a distorted offering
or a patient placidly waiting for her doctor
plainly put your clothes on rita
an awkward moment
chagrin becomes repressed sobs as rita picks up her pile of clothes off the floor and gets dressed
this is one fucked up little girl
affected no harm done
dont cry now
fully dressed again remotely staring rita holds back tears
trevor sits down on the couch next to her
why dont you go ahead and copy the first rule there for the verb to be
can you do that for me
hiccups a sob i jus waned to thank you
you dont have to thank me im your teacher
rita opens her notebook and begins to copy the rule
she wipes at the tears with the sleeve of her baggy sweat shirt
trevor resists the urge to comfort her
from now on i think the best thing for us to do is meet in the library
trevor kneels at the foot of his bed
fully dressed shirt and loosened tie
glimpses up at the crucifix on the wall
bows his head again
prayerfully to himself ill try
booming down from the blythe st
a cement barricade covered in graffiti chokes off street traffic
crack dealers and gangbangers freely wander the rows of clapboard tenements kids throwing sneakers bangers drinking from glass bottles
now apartment cesar sanchezs
moving in on the muted sounds of an argument in spanish
cesar and his mother continue their arguing as cesar watches first the animaniacs and switches channels to the deer hunter while his baby sister cries in her high chair
sanchez is older looking than her thirty four years
clutching her purse
on the verge subtitles
you stay of tears out of my deja mis cosas cesar
you hear me oyes
ese dinero es me
that money puts para poner comida en el food on your baby plato de tu hermanita
cesar yells at his sister to stop crying
cesar subtitlesshut up callate el osico rosillo
now to his mother que

you show me respect
sanchez subtitlesif youre the pues si eres tan hombre man then ve busca trabajo
para go get a job
take care que mantengas a tu madre y of your mother and hermanita y no tenga que sister
dont rob from robar de mi bolsa
in a rage cesar digs into his pocket and throws twenty dollars in his mothers face
cesar subtitleshere i dont tenga no nesecito su need your pinche apestoso dinero
theyre interrupted by a knock at the front door
indicating door i aint getting it
you get it
cesar plops down on an old worn out recliner and goes back to watching animaniacs on the television
rosillo stops her crying and mrs
sanchez carefully gathers the money scattered at her feet
behind the screen door a silhouette fills the doorway
he can faintly hear the o
conversation as he watches o
subtitlesyes whos si quien es
soy el im mr
senor garfield profesor garfield cesars de ciencia de cesar
surprised si maestro
cesars stunned look lifts him from the recliner
subtitlesi know its se que es tarde
ojala no late
hope este estorbando nada
im not disturbing me permite hablar con anything
may i speak usted por un momento
with you a moment
entre por favor
pivoting now to see trevor enter the front door
cesar glares with flint hard eyes at trevor
breaking his unrelenting stare cesar now squeezes past trevor and out the screen door slamming it behind him
sanchez cradles rosillo in her lap
beside herself subtitlesi dont know no se que hacer maestro
what to el no hace caso
he doesnt listen to me
rosillo begins to cry again
sanchez subtitlesgod but there perdona me dios pero hay are veces que quisiera times i want to kill matarlo
suppressing her emotions she comforts her baby
trevor weighs a vacuous stare
now he notices a bruise under mrs
sanchezs hairline above her left eye
indicating bruise subtitleshowd that como paso eso
arriba del happen
above your eye
overcome with shame she attempts to cover the bruise
steadfast and unflinching trevor beats a path back to his car parked outside the barricade
cesar now appears from nowhere
carries a ouncer in a paper bag
hes been drinking
venting rage puto
you lied to benny
you said you dont speak no spanish
no i didnt
enjoy hitting your mother cesar
you must be proud of yourself
a handful of gangbangers drinking and loitering around trevors car sharpen their stares and listen intently
cesar grows nervous
to gangbangers hes lyin man
at trevor fuckin liar
homeboy dont never disrespec his mother
you hear me joto
whatever you say cesar
trevor steps around the gangbangers and climbs into his car
ill find out where you stay
as the rambler drives away cesar heaves his ouncer at it
shatters all over the pavement
valla ala chingada
cesar stands in the middle of the street throwing hand signs
trevor approaches via the parking lot through a gate in a chain link fence
adjust the angle now to discover first period students mobbing the open doorway of bungalow
pushing through scuse me
whats going on
and lakesia who opened the door
it was like that when i got here
trevor squeezes through the doorway to find dave childress pacing the bungalow assessing the damage
video camera and housing are scattered in pieces all over the floor
one of the windows is smashed in
a serpentine trail of black spray paint encircles the entire room
provocative epithets tag the walls
pinche madre puto and fuck you g
whoever did this is gonna pay
better believe it ese s
a curious stream of students fill the room now
childress vents his anger at them
crazed now get the hell outta here
to armenian kid barsek dont touch anything okay
and now snowball
as barsek discovers him
impaled by a pair of scissors on the front counter
an incredulous sickened laugh oh damn
lookit the rat
off trevors stricken gaze
he grabs barsek by the throat
the crowd scatters students tripping over each other to get out of the bungalow
think its funny
yuh little fuck
trevor attempts to separate childress from barsek
let go of im
to barsek dyou do this
trevor pries them apart
barsek crumbles to the floor gulping for air and scurrying out of the bungalow on his hands and knees
he didnt do anything
hes a good kid
establishing the different student factions
music playing over a public address system fills the quad
trevor now an interloper crossing the senior lawn openly searching for cesar
tag bangers a clique of eight or nine k
wanna be s
feature paco as they take quick hits off a blunt
now cesar extinguishes the blunt with his fingertips and hides it as trevor wanders into their midst
glances around sniffs been smokin the chronic cesar
a smirk im hooked on phonics
not hooked on chronic
laughs all around
not amused you wouldnt happen tknow who vandalized bungalow eighty six last night
feigning ignorance you guys know anything about that
off silence sorry maestro
sotto garcia may not think theres enough here to prove anything
but you and i both know whos responsible
whadda you a narc
seriously i dont know what the fuck youre talkin about
trevor maintains his fervent demeanor
now he notices the ring on cesars right index finger
emblazoned with a green marijuana leaf
pointing the ring cesar
lemme have it
cesar dramatically jerks back his finger
watch it eh
thats my trigger finger
as cesar with purpose aims an invisible gun at trevor
its inappropriate attire
momentous deliberation are you finished
cesar starts to laugh
a crowd begins to gather
finished with what
dont get crazy on me dude
the boisterous crowd escalates
hoots and hollers
after weighing the situation trevor exchanges palpable looks with cesar
now he reluctantly back pedals squeezing his way past the wall of bodies pressed in behind him
his departure across an empty lawn is accompanied by a hail of boos and taunts
as an roars down onto the tarmac
in the f
trevor and ellen peel away from the curb angrily
traveling down hollywood way
in the front seat
these conferences mainly focus on software now
far off software sells
flickers a smile so hows jack
as they pull up to a stop light
flirtatious and what about trevor
was trevor a good boy too
triggers an unintended response
self consciously whats that supposed to mean
is that supposed to mean something
the light changes to green
an impatient young man in the car behind them beeps his horn
lays it on a little too long
as trevor gets out of the car marching up to the car behind slamming his hand down on its hood
cant you see im talking to the lady
the young man shrinks quickly rolling up his window
as trevor gets back in and they drive away
not a word is spoken
exorcising his demons now
off ellens disturbed gaze
as the rambler pulls into the driveway
ellens jeep cherokee is parked on the street
bug zapper above the garage flickers on
light now spills into the front yard
no sign of jack
trevor shuts off the ignition
a portentous silence
come out come out wherever you are
where is he
trevor reaches for a flashlight in the glove compartment
trevor and ellen step out of the car
moving through the chain link fence into the front yard
ellen whistles faintly
trevor turns on his flashlight
come to mommy sweetheart
the glare of the flashlight fixes on the trunk of the olive tree
jacks chain stretching tautly toward the back alley
reacting oh my god
trevor and ellen propelled now toward the alley hearts pounding frantically rushing toward the conclusion as the flashlight traces the length of the chain
right behind trevor jack
the chain disappears over the top of the alley wall
trevor kicks open the alley gate and freezes
centered in the flashlight beam dangling there strangled to death at the end of his dog collar
gut wrenching jack
trevor holds her back
she unleashes her torment punching and kicking until fully spent crumbling to her knees now sobbing hysterically
hold on her fitful sobs and
trevor a beaten hypnotic gaze watches as an animal regulations officer fatefully slams the cargo door of his truck
dont beat yourself up too much
it was an accident
he was probably after a cat
or someone walked past back here in the alley
whatever it was he jumped over the fence
what can you do
ellen watches trevors house behind a screen door
ellen sits on trevors bed fighting back tears
trevor enters with a glass of water and a pill
sits down on the edge of the bed
offering pill its aspirin
refuses it i cant talk to you right now trevor
im so upset i cant even drive
i just need some time alone
steps over to his desk and sets the glass of water down
a key protrudes from one of the desk drawers
he leans over removes the key and plays with it for a moment
beat i know about whats not fair
i left part of my lung in a damn hospital because some gangbanger didnt like the grade i gave him
sometimes you do all the right things
you work hard in school
get a good job
pay your taxes
things still go bad
eyes flicker im so sorry ellen
ellen shuts her heavy eyelids now
shuts out the world
a thorough investigation now at the foot of jacks wall
trevors flashlight fixes on a faint set of shoe prints in the dirt
waffle soled doc martens
he follows their trail down the alley
hesitating at the wall again
he now focuses his flashlight beam on a smattering of graffiti
and discovers a fresh tag
in black spray paint the letters k
trevor reaches out and touches a coagulated trickle of paint
as he inspects the faint residue on his fingertip
the streets empty
cesars darkened apartment is tucked away in the distance
now a lone figure emerges and beats a path through the projects
white t shirt sagging gray dickies
following him now
as he crosses the edge of a dirt lot
focusing on his doc marten boots and their waffle soled print
merging with cesar as he slinks down the dark alley corridor
lighting a blunt off his zippo lighter
cesar spray paints a wall with a can of black enamel paint
he takes another hit
chokes down a shit eating grin
and admires his work
a goofy dog smoking a blunt
below the dog he scrawls the word cartoon
above it k
as he slips the spray can into his front pocket he senses a presence
at you stevie
riveted cesar takes another slow hit off his blunt
suddenly a coyote darts past him
startled hells man
his sick smirk returns
but only momentarily
now a premonitory flicker registers on his face
he blinks as a masai arrow splits the darkness and pierces his left pectoral muscle
exhaling a stunned breath cesar looks down at the arrow
an incredulous stupefied laugh escapes him as he pulls the arrow out of his chest and studies it
the normal length of the arrows been shortened by half and the tip has been fitted with a modified hypodermic needle
the needle extends from a rubber stopper which has retracted into the hypodermic casing causing the solution in the hypo to jettison through the needle and into cesar
now back pedaling stumbling dropping the arrow he turns and runs off
cesar collapses onto a pile of garbage bags
his eyes fixed and dilated
forehead beaded with perspiration
fighting against the effects of the injection
ellen awakens with a start
she glances about momentarily disoriented
now she remembers where she is and what happened
choking back emotions
tv set on
ellen enters glances around
as ellen returns
she notices the glass of water on the desk
bravely collects herself
crosses over to the desk and sits down
whered you put the aspirin
like an involuntary reflex she tugs on the center drawer of the desk but its locked
now she pulls on one of the side drawers and it slides open
ellen stops at what she sees
a treasure trove of homemade shivs bic lighters walkmen pagers
and benny chacons black rosary beads
back to ellen and her curious sobered look
now she slowly shuts the drawer
fumbling in her purse for her keys ellen makes a hasty departure
almost six am
encroaching sunlight creeps toward the horizon
a vapid stillness
not a soul stirs
as he comes to
eyes feverish registering pain
his head throbs
he begins to move and discovers a pounding in his right hand
lifting his hand up in front of his face
cesars ring index finger has been severed clean off
blood is everywhere
cesar emotes a silent panic stricken scream
reduced to a snot sobbing wreck he frantically searches the ground on his hands and knees
please somebody help me
wheres my finger
pushing in on the emergency room sign
moving past the unrelenting urgency that permeates the er
discover cesar now in a wheelchair right hand completely wrapped in gauze
he pleads with two police detectives
i put it on my mother sir
leaning forward good cop so your science teacher shot you with an arrow full of drugs then chopped off your finger
come on you can do better than that cesar
it had to be him
bad cop he smoke the mota for yuh too eh ese
he hates my guts man
you covering for somebody homes
cuz this circumstantial bullshit wont hold up in court ill tell you that right now
detective refers to a rap sheet
sadly caught too many priors cesar
juvenile gta vandalism
i know he did it
dont you hear what im saying
you saw his face
lying yeah yeah
i seen him
detective shakes his head and grimaces
lemme save yuh from perjuring yourself asshole
youre full of shit
i swear it
turns to leave cmon this guys wasting our time
points to cesar come up with something better than that or the truth then maybe well talk
detective walks away
cesar hangs his head mumbling a disparaging flood of spanish expletives
through passing patients and personnel
approaching the receiving desk
as the blurred shoulder of an orderly crosses out to reveal a legal sized white envelope now on the counter top
a busy e
nurse notices the envelope
picks up the envelope and reads the name typed across the face of it
narrowing her gaze as she opens the envelope
in the envelope cesars severed finger nesting in a clump of newspaper
appears to be something tattooed across the side of it but we cant quite make it out
the nurse gasps and drops the envelope spilling the finger onto the counter top
close now on the finger and the fresh tatt scrawled across its side r u dun
sound fades now from the scene replaced by a techno hip hop track that continues through the cut
rain lashes the faculty parking lot
hip hop track fades now replaced by the buzz of cross talk
trevor strolls the aisles an open science book in hand
note rita is dressed in overalls very subdued compared to her usual attire
and seated in his regular seat across from stevie littleton
uncharacteristically his eyes are fixed on the book in front of him
addressing class name one of four parts that make up the human hand
trevor holds up his hand for display
a reluctant cross section of hands go up
th period is by no means a synchronized whole but there has developed an odd sort of order to its madness
trevor looks around
picks on an anglo girl in the second row
to class name some more
now he picks on rita
a flurry of thumbs go up as if on cue
holding up all his fingers now and dont forget the phalanges
fingers shoot up and wiggle on cue
in unison phalanges phalanges phalanges
scattered laughter and groans at this embarrassing routine
cesars beaten gaze remains riveted to his book
now he slides a look at the r u dun tatt on his right index finger
the severed finger has been sewn back on supported by a finger brace
stevie openly stares at the back of trevors head as trevor passes by in the aisle
rain steadily plays against the windows
ellen sits behind her computer lost in a grading program
trevor now enters
damp hair and shoulders
may i come in
ellen stops what shes working on
concerned whered you go the other night
i was going to ask you the same thing
i went for a run
changes subject wanna get some chinese later
theres a new place in the valley center
spose to be pretty good
an excuse cant tonight
maybe another time
weighs it and
stands there for a moment i should probably correct papers anyway
some of these bungalow kids actually care about a grade
even cesars doing better
today for the first time since i took over for eskander he actually did his work
beat today cesar sanchez was a success
maybe for the first time in his life
blinks now you alright
much better thank you
a tacit satisfaction that all is well
i really am sorry about jack
he exits now leaving ellen alone with her thoughts
before school tutoring session
the minute hand on the wall clock jerks ahead one minute
trevor and rita at a table near the back of the library
trevor gazes blankly at ritas essay
rita revises one of the pages
intercut dave childress at the front counter as the librarian late fifties photocopies a page from a history book for him
childress scrutinizes trevor and rita as he waits
satisfied now rita slides the page to trevor
trevor blinks himself back to reality
lets hava look
he adjusts his glasses
pores over the paper
deliberating i was just thinking since your essays about gangs and getting away from their influence you probably couldve left some of those double negatives you like so well
confused so now you wan me to use bad grammar
explaining only if it suits your topic
were all products of our environment n shit
no i think thats just an excuse
beat i say if were strong we can rise above adversity
lets it sink in but its like rap or hip hop
correct all the grammar and it loses its impact
so you like hip hop mr
shakes his head i hate it
reacting what kinda black man are you
trevor bursts forth a laugh
childress perks up at the front counter
trevors laugh evokes a smile from rita
now she pries a little further
why you here anyways
dont you got nothin better tdo
everything i wanna do is right here
back on track now its a good essay rita
you put a lot of effort into it it shows
a laconic grin comes from the heart maestro
im a writer
not a fighter
trevor returns a cognitive flicker
hinting now ms
quinn was telling me she picks two seniors each year to read their essays at graduation
taken aback she aint gonna pick my paper
anyway i dont wanna get up in fronna all those people and make a fool outta myself
itd be a pyrrhic victory
in your case irony
refers to king pyrrhus
look it up sometime
off ritas reluctance
a churning fist of muddy water cuts a path along the perimeter of a golf course and jogging trail
tracing jogging trail keeping pace now with a die hard runner
something registers in the runners eyes pace slowing now stopping
not fully comprehending what he is looking at
following his gaze
through a curtain of rain and tall swamp grass
along the riverbank
to the base of the burbank boulevard overpass
slowing angle to discover precariously jutting out of the rushing waters in a tangle of chicken wire fence a partially decomposed torso
ellen walks down an aisle of computers as the class settles
before getting side tracked with viruses and t s r programs we were talking yesterday about e mail
ellen passes stevies computer as he shares cryptic information with a kid sitting next to him
ellen approaches her computer console on wheels at the front of the class
if you click on the mail icon in your tray youll be ready to send and receive mail
my computers already set up
everyone go ahead and click the white envelope in the lower
ellens interrupted by her own computer
a little white envelope icon in the lower left hand tray flashes and beeps
now a computer voice announces youve got mail
ellens taken aback
now she grins
looks like someones way ahead of me
adapts and demonstrates to retrieve your mail simply double click the top item in your mail list
as she does since were all a part of the same network we share mail
so go ahead and do that
the message read teacher fucks niggers class is dumbstruck
now she turns
without losing her temper she scours the class with a narrow gaze
class starts to buzz
now a clicking frenzy to retrieve the same message
the anonymous message pops up on computer screens all around the classroom
ellens pov of students and stevie
lingering on stevies poker face
her own poker face now
whoever sent that message isnt as anonymous as they think
ellen turns to her console clicks the reply button
a new mail message window opens up
its addressed to the anonymous sender student
ellen types in all the while anticipation builds on stevies face
he glances around starting to get nervous
ellen now clicks the send button
stevies computer beeps
computer voice youve got mail
a window opens in the middle of stevies monitor revealing ellens return message
class erupts and stevie springs out of his seat
dats bullshit man
he rushes up to the front of the class
you best step off ms
cuz you cant prove nuthin
and i know you cant afford to lose dis minimum wage job a yers
beat and youre right stevie
i cant afford to live in a big house south of the boulevard
like you do
class erupts again coming down on stevie and his wanna be poor boy from the streets image
theyre laughing at him now not with him
in a rage stevie kicks open the hallway door and exits the classroom
ellen hastily enters looking for stevie
addresses iris a thirty something hispanic woman behind the counter
iris did steven littleton come in here
havent seen im
teacher the insipid woman checks her mail slot
its her conference period
appalled youre not supposed to leave your classroom unattended
reacting sue me
teacher exits in a flurry
ellen now glances to her right
seated there in rigid silence is benny chacons offers sotto benny chacons mother
told er garcia had to leave early today but she jus sits there
she been saying some pretty crazy things
chacon begins speaking spanish in plaintive spurts
ellen cant decipher what she is saying
chacon espanol muy poquito senora
you have to slow down
back to iris whats she saying
now with apprehension
you heard bout that body they foun in the l
she says she thinks its benny
off ellens unblinking gaze
a concrete fortress
ellen and mrs
ellen and mrs
chacon sit stiffly in front of the assistant coroner mid forties
half eaten sandwich in front of him
he nurses a styrofoam cup of coffee as he flips through a john doe folder
you say hes been missing approximately four weeks
four almost five weeks
thats a long time
lots a things happen to a body after four or five weeks
makes it difficult to i
a faint incongruous smile
indicating john doe so he just sits here
we keep um up to thirty days
lady we get sometimes does a month
floaters gangbangers illegals junkies
most of um cheap homicides
nobodys even lookin for em
indicating folder this guy here has a dent in his head
could be post mortem trauma
probably hit a retaining wall on his way down river after that rain we had
beat yuh ask me this kid was dead before he got his head caved in
overdose by morphine
thats what it looks like tme
ellen weighs it
assistant coroner now refers to some sort of questionnaire
on the phone you said the mother mentioned some identifying marks
ellen refocuses a far off introspective gaze
affirmative she said he has some pockmarks on his chest from a bad case of chicken pox
and theres a bar code tattoo on his neck
a cognitive flicker now as the assistant coroner sets down his coffee
the acrid fecal smell causes ellen to flinch
averting her eyes she holds onto mrs
chacons arm as they stand next to the autopsy table
a plastic diaphanous sheet covers the body
now the assistant coroner raises the sheet
chacons traumatic gaze confirms her worst fears
she raises a hand to her mouth
now the tears come
as she comforts mrs
to assistant coroner sotto did you find any rosary beads with the body
the digital clock next to trevors bed reads a
hold for a portentous moment
now the stillness is broken by a clatter at the front door
someone enters the house
jolts out of bed
disoriented a beat
in boxer shorts and a t shirt adjusting his glasses trevor ventures through darkness
a light flickers on in the living room
you should keep your door locked
adjusting the angle now as the living room comes into ellen paces back and forth consumed by whats troubling her
still half asleep whats the matter
ellen ignores his question
impaling him with a look i just want you to tell me one thing
now something she sees stops her pacing
the black rosary beads on the dinner table
off ellens puzzled look what
following her gaze he picks up the rosary beads
as he places them in a drawer in the credenza
what is it
lost in a fixated gaze
if you had any idea what ive been thinking lately
youd think i was crazy
running it through her mind remember that john doe they found in the l
turned out it was benny
impacted who told you that
bennys mother identified the body
trevor just looks at her a bated pause
now he blinks
benny was no saint ellen
this is a kid who terrorized hald the school
he even broke into your house
maybe we should think about that fore we shed any tears
ellen just looks at him
maybe hes better off
thats a horrible thing to say
trevor accepts that it is
do you believe for every troubled kid like benny theres one or two others just waiting to take his place
or his friend stevie
an awkward moment of silence
you dont know anything about cesars finger do you trevor
sometimes a person just runs out of bad choices
then hes gotta pay a price
what happened to cesar was inevitable
ellen flickers a terrified smile
youre scaring me
we make choices in life and we live by em
you and i chose to be teachers to stand on principle
benny and cesar theyre takers
they want what they want and they want it now
unravelling im sorry but everyone cant always get what they want
sometimes you gotta take responsibility for your actions
have you ever been ready to die for a fundamental principle
you think those punks would die protecting your civil rights
did you know cesar hits his mother
steals money from her purse
did you know that
did you know he was here that night
in the alley
confused what are you talking about
jack was provoked
it wasnt an accident ellen
cesar killed him
ellen just stares at him
momentous deliberation whered you get the rosary beads
i like you ellen
i like you so much
do you believe that
trevor cant find words
i dont know you
with that ellen turns and walks out of the house as quickly as she came
plaintively you do know me
im a teacher just like you
establish hoardes of cowboy hats belt sashes and boots as they dance to the loud mexican band music on the patio
non hispanics along with non quebradita cliques look on from the lawn area
hanging back on the fringes scoping out the crowd
notices a pack of cigarettes in the chest pocket of a year old kid standing next to him
kids wrapped up in talking to another kid points to something o
to the kid with cigarettes dont you know its not polite to point at people
everytime you point a finger at someone else
demonstrates theres three fingers pointing back at you
lesson over lemme have a cigarette
cinco de mayo
the sounds of a quebradita waft in from outside in the quad
at the same time steve follows him into the rest room
theyre all alone
bracing himself with a fixed straight ahead look
boldly im talkin ta you garfield
beat know what you did to cesar
wild notion im thinkin maybe you did benny too
incredulously that possible
you crush my friends skull
fuck im up wit a two by four maybe a baseball bat
as trevor starts to leave stevie blocks his path
trevor steps to one side to go around
but stevie blocks his path again
trying to maintain please step out of the way
you kill my friend
trevors head begins to swim
his lifes falling apart
like a trapped animal he back pedals a step to escape
but then suddenly snaps
he explodes into stevie crushing him against the bath room wall
trevor impales stevie with a look that says it all
stevie immediately shrinks
trevor now blinks
cooling himself down
slowing his breathing
stevie slips out from under his hold and bolts for the exit
cesar and his tag bangers
cesar holds court drowned out by the music
now stevie arrives
out of breath
urgent to tell his story
makeup subdued wearing a cotton button down blouse
she watches the quebradita from behind a tree
a desire to be part of it she moves a little closer
as cesar notices her
his head races from stevies news
on a rampage he shoves his way through the crowd
on the opposite side of the patio snapping a look spotting cesar moving in for the kill
with a start victor barks something into his walkie talkie and squeezes his way into the quebradita crowd
cesar shoves rita to the ground
school girl bitch
rita gets to her feet immediately
shaken you gotta problem
yer fuckin maestro ats my problem
i dont know what yer talkin bout
garfield killed benny
rita looks at him like hes insane
cesars entourage gathers around them
she turns her back and starts to leave
cesar grabs her again
dont turn yer back on me when im talkin tyou bitch
you think yer better than everybody else
well you aint
you aint nuthin but a whore
fuck you asshole
you forget about the time in the bungalows
we all had our turn wit you man
gets in her face what the fuck you been fuckin a nigger for
you think hes gonna protec you
stop me from doin whatever i want wit you
stop any of us from doin what we want wit you
rita just stands there destroyed and sobbing now
fuck you cesar
no fuck you
he grabs her blouse and rips it wide open
his eyes glisten with fervor now as he punches rita with his good hand square in the face
she crumbles to the ground as victor bursts through the crowd and restrains cesar
as rita gets to her feet and flees into the quebradita crowd
garfield better watch his back
standing room only
an impassioned crowd
i wanna know if this boy was killed and whether it was gang related
the audience erupts in unanimous support
playing to crowd now as a mother and a taxpayer i have a right to know
and if it was gang related then i want tighter security
at this point shes drowned out by the crowd
on stage the discipline committee including trevor childress hyland and quinn sit at the dais
garcia stands at the podium waiting for silence
ford the assistant principal a full figured black woman in her mid fifties stands alongside him gesturing for the crowd to settle down
too noisy the death of benito chacon is not gang related
thats something you heard on the news
shouting out who says
how can you be so sure
youre talking about my kids safety
please everyone just calm down
thank you mrs
now the police at this point arent even sure if its a case of murder
the reason were having this meeting tonight is to quash all the rumors floating around out there
heres what we do know
benny chacon ultimately died from a drug overdose technically it was morphine
volume rising again which is what heroin breaks down into
benny was no junkie
i know who did it
ellen quietly enters now and stands just inside one of the doors at the back of the hall
up at the dais trevor notices her
its not the gangbangers ygotta worry about
its the teachers
thats exactly the type of rumor we dont need mr
stevie deliberately stands and points at trevor with vitriol in his eyes
it was garfield
the audience grows silent
losing his patience say one more word and youre suspended
sit down stevie
trevor doesnt even flinch
childress scrutinizes him with a glance
ranting youre a fuckin murderer garfield
calling for assistance victor
maybe i cant prove it but i know he did it
he fucked up cesar and he killed benny
to crowd ast im
as victor and another plainclothes cop attempt to remove stevie
touch me and ill sue yer ass
as victor backs off now to trevor yer dead g
yer a dead man
with that stevie shoves victor aside and bolts for the door
garcia attempts to regain his composure
trevor glances back to the spot where ellen was standing
but now shes gone
meetings broken up
dave childress cigarette dangling from his mouth jogs a step to catch up with trevor
garfield wait up
trevor maintains a steady pace one hopeful eye scouring the parking lot for ellen
dont let that littleton punk get to you
trevor ignores him
lil bastards a tweaker
hes a speed freak
you didnt know that
at trevors car now
turning to childress
testing his patience what is it dave
how can i help you
unintentionally in trevors face
how bout a ride
taking a step back the wife wouldnt let me drive my own car
aint that a bitch
childress is pitiful
wears a grease stained tie with his wrinkled hawaiian shirt and a windbreaker
with resignation you smell like beer
i only had two
swear ta christ
raising his palms
trevor studies him with a sad grimace
i live right up here off chandler
ill buy you a drink
at the end of a gravel driveway behind a darkened house
garage door open
childress chain smokes and drinks beer as he leans against the dented fender of his lincoln continental
trevor nurses a diet coke
i had the same situation round the time of that night stalker thing
whole city was scared shitless
my wife was convinced the frickin mailman was the stalker for about a week there
a tubercular chuckle some mental giant in my th period starts this rumor see
childress is the night stalker
chug a lugs idiots
even after they caught that ramirez jerk id still hear those fucks
they got the wrong guy
childress is the stalker ese
he finishes beer
trevor studies him without expression
now he notices something stapled to the tar paper wall
trevors pov of the certificate of excellence in teaching yellowed and dogeared hanging obliquely by one staple
as childress opens another beer
excusing himself i better get goin
thanks for the soda
hold your horses
just hold on
finding a key in a drawer
a twisted grin cant leave without meetin the kids
childress unlocks a particle board cabinet against the garage wall
a watery glint in his bloodshot eyes
cabinet door swings wide now revealing a mini arsenal of handguns
trevors eyes remain expressionless
childress rhapsodizes as he removes and handles some of the guns
this ones from czechoslovakia
its a c z
ten round clip
glow in the dark sights
eyeing the sights aint that a beauty
next then we gotta custom smitty milli
with extended grip
these smith wessons kick like a mutha
and next now this ones special
lightest gun in the world
the barrel and firing pin are metal
everything else on its plastic
handing it to trevor here feel that
trevor takes it reluctantly weighs it in the palm of his hand
sets it down
now childress removes a gun from a holster in the small of his back under his windbreaker
course you can never be too prepared
my pukey lil davis
a severe squint you wear that thing at school
a smirk dont worry
they never use metal detectors on teachers
beat i also keep a
inside my desk
a wry grin but you already know that
didnt think i was payin attention didja
shoulda seen the look on your face
at an imaginary student
now jose if ive told you once ive told you a hundred times stay in your cotton pickin seat
aiming gun boom
childress laughs and chokes on his cigarette
now he gazes at the
in his hand
lost in a stupid recalcitrant grin
havent you ever just wanted to blow one of these little bastards away
childress glances up into trevors unflinching gaze
smiles to himself now
thinks hes funny
digressing speaking of blowing you ever wanna fuck a high school girl garfield
off no response caught yer girl rita bustin a train out in the utility shed couple months back
swear to god
she had at least five or six cholos lined up back there
as trevors eyes narrow face it brother shes a slut
cmon i know you had er
bragging now i even did her
i know you been laughin at me behind my back
im talkin about screwin high school broads and youre givin off this self righteous attitude like your shit dont stink
childress rolls back on his heels
tell me the truth now garfield
did yuh do it
cmon i wont tell
did yuh whack benny
whadda bout cesar
that was generous only taking his finger
i woulda cut off his balls
go to hell dave
all traces of a smile fade from daves face
trevor just stands there
doesnt say a damn word
childress makes his own momentous conclusion
almost exulted you really did it
you son of a bitch
awkward glint of admiration in childresss eye
leans forward hangs a hand on trevors shoulder
disgusted you probably think you and me are alike
trevor turns and exits the garage
pulling back from childresss dull anesthetized gaze
deep down inside childress knows hes a pathetic piece of shit
trevor pulls into his driveway right up to the garage door
he shuts off the ignition and narrows a gaze out the front windshield
caught in his headlights tagged all over
spray painted threats like youre dead um teacher k crossed out and a cartoon version of dimly lit
trevor stands in front of the television set staring at a late night repeat of talk soup
a clip from sally jessy rafael or jerry springer
one of those sturm und drang moments
everyone points the finger at everyone else
no one willing to take responsibility for themselves
only partially watching the television
his eyes are fixed on a point somewhere in his own mind lost to the world
into a parabolic mirror above the library doors
an empty corridor stretches forever
trevor now unshaven looking like he hasnt slept sits amidst total silence in his regular spot
no sign of rita
he checks his wristwatch
peering toward the library doors
now above the doors
back and forth between the mirror and trevor
his eyes glazed and unblinking
further into the parabolic mirror now
breathing becoming more and more labored
in a flicker were transported back to roosevelt whitney
dennis broadways image slowly coming toward us down the long corridor
trevor catches his breath and blinks
back to reality
the mirror is empty
he removes his proventil inhaler from his shirt pocket
suppressing gasps he takes two hits
two girls at the magazine racks whisper to each other eyes firmly fixed on trevor
suddenly theres a presence at trevors side
i dont think shes coming
strictly low rent district
the small dirt yard in front is contained within a cinder block wall
rita back to her chola look heavy makeup black right eye where cesar punched her watches her two younger brothers as they fight over a toy truck
her three year old baby sister maricella too big to be carried straddles her hip as rita yells at the boys
be nice to your brother antonio
dont make me go get mommie
trevors car pulls up
ritas taken aback
setting maricella down go play wit your brothers
rita attempts to thwart him at the sidewalk
almost defensive whatcha doin here maestro
with fervor i want you to come back to school rita
you cant afford to miss finals
they wont let you graduate
overlapping no way
whats wrong wit you
trevor really does looks like hell
beseeching her cesar and stevie wont bother you
thats a promise
something stirs deep inside her
struggles with it whyd they have to kill snowball
on the verge of tears now whats it fuckin matter
at school shits for other kids not me
thats not true
youre so smart rita
dont you know that
you have an opportunity here to change your life
please dont throw away everything weve worked for
trevor just stares at her incredulously
rita lowers her gaze unable to look him in the eye
momentous deliberation and now
i know what happened with childress
knitting her eyebrows what
beat he wont ever touch you again
protesting too much he aint done nuthin tuh me
that boys fulla shit
whats he been sayin
he aint never touched me no ways
whats he sayin
he say he fucked me

off trevors look hes a damn liar
erupting again tears streaming down her face get the fuck outta here
i dont need yer damn pity and i dont need you
genuinely but i need you rita
hardening you made a mistake
with that rita scoops up maricella and exits
trevor sits transfixed in front of garcia
still hasnt shaven
garcia holds up a handful of phone messages
theyre phone calls about you
cesars mother told me how you tried to help him
youre evidently a good teacher
you should be commended on your efforts
pause im going to have to let you go
beat as much as id like to have you stay until the end of the year i cant overlook the seriousness of certain accusations
garcia waits for a response but none is forthcoming
for example is it true you had meetings with a female student at your house
i was trying to help her
the implications are still there mr
i cant afford to open the door for another lawsuit
sure you can appreciate my position
pause you can stay until friday
i hope that will be sufficient
this part registers only minimally with trevor
a vapid silence holds us
the bungalow is awash in a sun soaked pool of light
trevor makes his way toward the parking lot with his briefcase and a cardboard box of personal belongings
plagued with doubts ellen lingers in the doorway confiding with hyland
youre not being an alarmist
minimizing her concerns he gets a little overzealous at times
like some other people i know
beat i dont think the rosary adds up to much either frankly
its probably his
beat look when i received my first holy communion all the boys got black rosaries and the girls got white
trust me there must be millions of black rosaries filed away in desk drawers from here to the vatican
ellen flickers a sad indecisive smile
this guys been through a lot ellen
the system failed him
i dont think any of us can really appreciate what hes been through
beat i say we give the man a break
ellen acquiesces a pensive nod
through a chain link fence trevor approaches his car
traffic is bumper to bumper
as trevor unlocks his car
a bold has been keyed into the paint
now he slides the cardboard box along with his briefcase onto the front seat
suddenly as if out of nowhere ellen pulls up in her cherokee
she deciphers trevor with mixed emotions
trevor adjusts his stance covering the
ellen now tentatively rolls her window down halfway
tailpipe sputters a portentous idle
stilted id like to apologize for the other night
trevor stands there transfixed for a moment
now he looks into her eyes
a soulful gaze
shouldnt listen to me
i was half asleep
his eyes become damp
trevor smiles bravely
we really need to talk
have to finish some work
its important to me
far off now okay
resolves it in her head how bout seven oclock
ellen flickers a tenuous smile
as she rolls up her window and drives away leaving trevor standing in the middle of the parking lot
his image gets smaller and smaller in the mirror
as she watches him in the side view mirror torn with mixed emotions
thru thru seeing now that the whole house has been tagged with graffiti not only the garage as the rambler pulls into the driveway
with dead calm trevor leaves his box of belongings behind and enters the front door carrying his briefcase
as it parks about two houses down from trevors
all three tag bangers produce firearms
cesar loads the cylinder chamber on his
stevie double checks a round clip and a smith and wesson
and paco plays with a
caliber revolver that he hides in the deep front pocket of is county bens
the interior of the buick snaps with the hard sound of gun metal
cocking hammers loading cartridges and spinning cylinder chambers
as the gun preparations systematically stop
cesar now flicks on an electric hair clipper sets it on no clip and passes it back to paco
paco runs the clipper over his head
hair tumbles off in chunks
stevie fidgets picks up a naked one eyed doll off the floor raises it into view
whered you jack dis car from homes
referring to doll ats nasty man
dutifully seated at his desk
like a fervent prayer
lost in correcting his final graded assignment
past wrought iron bars on the outside of the window
sun hangs above a distorted horizon
past high tension lines outside mother henrys kitchen window
ellens preoccupied with thought as she rinses dishes and places them in the dishwasher
hear wheel of fortune on the television
now a wet dish slips from her grasp and shatters on the floor
as she picks up the pieces
its alright mother
sun goes down
a palpable stillness permeates
all three heads clipped skin tight
fixed gazes holding
stevie nurses a runny nose as he smokes another sherm
now something flickers in cesars eyes
okay lets smoke this bitch
the house is quiet now as stevie and paco disappear around the back
cesar approaches the front door undaunted gun drawn
without breaking stride he kicks open the door
trevor sits on his bed watching the red orb of the sun disappear over the horizon
he can hear door opening and someone moving in his house
im in here cesar
cesar paco and stevie enter the bedroom guns drawn
dont move mutha fucka
stevie flips on a light
paco shoots out the tv set in the living room an act of intimidation
cesar jams his
under trevors chin
gets in his face
you killed benny
and you cut off my finger
trevor stares right into cesars eyes unflinching
fuckin a man
lemme do im
this niggas mine
cesar sticks the gun barrel right between trevors eyes and squeezes the trigger
an empty sound
cesar exhales a malicious laugh
opens a fist to reveal six bullets
ever seen the deerhunter ese
in the middle of the dark house trevors dining room table
trevor on one side cesar paco stevie on the other
cesars seated loading one of the six bullets into a cylinder chamber
he shoves the gun toward trevor as stevie and paco train their pistols on him
you gon do yourself mayate
put it to your head and pull the trigger
trevor grabs the pistol without hesitation puts it to his head and squeezes off two rounds without incident
he slams the gun down in front of cesar without a blink
a crazed watery glint in his eye
that macho enough for you cesar
that make me a man
take moren that
then you do it
all three tag bangers are taken aback
cmon show me what you got
mano a mano

i gotta be a fool to prove youre a fool
trevor picks up the gun again puts it to his head and pulls the trigger
slams the gun down
thas not how we playin it
why you too chickenshit to play yer own game

paco lashes out and hits trevor with his pistol drawing blood
cesar stares at him
you gonna let your homies defend your punk ass cesar
you gonna let me dis you
i pulled three times you pussy you leva you coward
lessee you pull one
cmon be a man

cesar takes the gun and raises it toward his head

he grabs cesars arm but cesar pushes him away
to trevor you disrespectin me vato

cesar puts the
to his temple again
dont do it
they are mesmerized into inaction as cesar grits his teeth and pulls the trigger
instant adulation you the man cesar
you the man
to trevor he got character homes
crazy mutha fucka
trevor looks at cesar in disgust as he takes another bullet and blindly loads it into the cylinder chamber
he spins the cylinder and slams the gun on the table
you think you got respect now
your kinda respect is bullshit
only thing you honor is stupidity
you ready to die for stupidity cesar
i am if itll teach you somethin

he snatches up the gun puts it to his head and pulls the trigger again
trevor slams it back down on the table
you cant kill me
and you cant scare me
cesars sweating now glancing between trevor and the gun on the table
stevie and paco shift uneasily
dont do it homie
yeah but isnt that what you respect
dont listen to em cesar
if you gonna live stupid dont do it half assed take it all the way
take your turn
pull the trigger
caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place cesars hand inches toward the gun
suddenly trevor is screaming at him
macho is bullshit fool
your whole way of life is bullshit
cesar explodes to his feet and screams right back
its all i got
trevor studies him with an enigmatic look
well then ill take your turn for you
he snatches up the pistol and puts it to his head
pulls the trigger
the shot knocks trevor out of his chair
thru thru you see dat
hes fuckin out
whatd he do that for
he walks toward the back of the house like a zombie
lets get outta here
paco pulls at cesar whos staring at trevors dead body
he took my turn
it was my turn
he took it
he dissed me
so fuckin what man
cesar shrugs him off picks up the
i gotta do this
fuck dis shit
he tries to pull cesar away pleading with him in spanish but cesar shoves him off
i got one chance in six

paco rushes toward him but is stopped by the boom
frozen in shock paco stares down at cesars body as stevie re enters the kitchen
whyd he do it
not knowing himself paco stumbles out of trevors kitchen toward the back door
finally stevie follows him as we pull back to reveal the crumpled bodies of trevor and cesar lying on the floor
last night tragedy struck in north hollywood where a high school teacher and one of his students were both found shot to death inside the teachers home
continues through the
the marquee outside the school reads
the teacher has been identified as forty one year old trevor garfield formerly of new york city
most recently he taught science at john quincy adams high school in the san fernando valley
beat confidential sources reveal that the teacher had publicly been accused of foul play in the death of another student whose body was discovered just last month in the l
graduation in progress
standing room only
administrators have begun to take their seats up on a makeshift stage
garcia hyland assistant principal ford etc
bleachers now as guests and family members fan themselves against the searing heat
a banner strung across the top row of seats reads
faculty members are seated in the first two rows down on the field
in front of a sea of mortar boards
dave childress now enters his usual shabby attire nursing another hangover
he takes a seat away from the other teachers
as the first speaker approaches the podium
on two inch high heels an occasional wobble as the white high heels make their way up to the podium
angle rising now lingering on a clinging powder blue dress and mani cured fingernails
hold on her clenched essay
now continue up to reveal rita nartinez
she wears lipstick
and only a moderate amount of eye shadow
she wears a slightly nervous preoccupied look
rita at the podium as she adjusts the microphone a nervous reflex
places her essay on the podium
stares down at it
the title of my essay is mi vida loca
my crazy life
now she gazes out at the graduating class
intently fanning themselves
arms draped over the empty chairs on either side of him
turning to quinn ms
quinn can i say somethin
correcting herself may i say something
quinn hesitates now acquiesces with uncertainty
theres been a lotta talk las couple weeks whether mr
garfield done those things they been writin about in the newspaper
he once tol me you cant blame everything on yer environment
beat but i tink you can push a good teacher too far and he might jus go bad like anybody else
thru thru intercut various cuts of ellens hands as she clears a bulletin board
removes a computer graphics display from a wall
empties desk drawers
and packs away her computer in a box
i dunno if mr
g did all those bad things
all i know is dat teachers dont get no respect
ats the simple truth
and if mr
g is responsible well den he aint the only one responsible
were all responsible
you and me
all of us
im up here today cuz a him
he was dere for me when nobody else was
i shoulda been dere for him too
but i wasnt
i turned my back on the only person who ever cared about me
pause he said if i could stand up here and read my essay it would be a pyrrhic victory
beat i ast im whats up wit dat
a trickle of incongruous laughter awkward yet cathartic
he told me in my case it was irony
and to go look it up
so i did
beat i wonder now if mr
g was really talking bout hisself
beat it refers to this guy named pyrrhus
he was a king back round b
rita refers to a piece of scratch paper she has tucked inside her essay
as she now empties one last drawer she dis covers her teaching credential
reluctantly picks it up
holds it for a moment
now read across the face of the credential
issues this document to verbatim now pyrrhus defeated the romans on two occasions
but those two victories lost him a large part of his army
now whenever people say somethings a pyrrhic victory they mean its a victory gained at too great a cost
childress stares off into space flickers a pathetic smirk
and now stevie seated amongst the graduates
glancing up from under his mortar board cap
he adjusts a gaze into the bleachers
early forties upper middle class
stevies mother catches his eye
like an incongruous slow motion dream she mouth the words were
as guilt eats at him weaving its insidious web
now at the podium
holding back tears rita now carefully folds up her piece of scratch paper
and fixes a distant unblinking gaze
slowly scan the walls stripped completely bare now
end on ellen standing obliquely in the doorway
brief case in hand files and papers tucked under one arm
her face a solemn vacuous gaze
now she drops something into the trash can shuts off the lights and leaves
as the door slowly closes
move in on the trash can
and ellens crumpled teaching credential
add another name to the list of fallen heroes as we
and roll end credits
