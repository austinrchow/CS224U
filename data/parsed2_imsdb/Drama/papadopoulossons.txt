written by marcus markou final version with dialogue changes
zorba the ballet by the hungarian state symphony
classical and uplifting
a very english scene a beautiful english garden belonging to a mansion house
a smartly turned out gardener in green overalls is raking leaves
its an impressive picture of britishness and order
another gardener dave is trimming the edge of the lawn
we see shots of the garden plants trees a gazebo sundial water fountain etc
we follow one of the gardeners pushing a wheelbarrow across the width of the lawn and we see the rear of this impressive property
title papadopoulos sons mrs parrington knocks on a bedroom door
the door opens on harry papadopoulos in his bedroom doing up his shirt in a mirror
a chauffeur driven mercedes pulls up to the front of the mansion house
mrs parrington the housekeeper and nanny waits for the car
harry and his children james katie and theo exit through the front door
as they do so mrs parrington makes sure the children are smartly turned out
the chauffeur gets out and opens the door for the children
we see the car make its way through london and images of the city the gherkin natwest tower canary wharf
the mercedes pulls up outside a hotel
a presenter is standing behind a lectern with a large crystal vase award
behind him on the stage we see a european entrepreneur of the year award banner
orphaned when he was just a boy harry papadopoulos came to this country with nothing
we cut to the family seated at a round table
the children look bored
harry listens proudly
harry was a grafter entering the restaurant trade as a young man
beat thats a euphemism for greek waiter isnt it
there is some laughter in the audience
we cut to harry again who attempts to smile off the joke
only joking harry
he then started the now famous papadopoulos sons doing all things greek
from taramasalata to olive oil and frozen mousakas which i must admit my wife and i are partial to occasionally
not one to settle harrys made the move into commercial property where hes about to embark on one of the most audacious developments yet papadopoulos plaza
a two million square foot redevelopment in the heart of our great city
applause from the audience ladies and gentlemen i give you european entrepreneur of the year
we now cut to harry getting up from the table
he momentarily acknowledges the applause
the children are clapping politely but absently
its the photo call for european entrepreneur of the year
a photographer is taking shots of harry holding his award
katie james and theo stand alongside their father
the children look disinterested
referring to the vase now just hold it up a bit for me
yeah thats nice
bunch up a bit
just look at the camera
a little bit more
now touch the vase for me if you dont mind
what a perv
with a stammer katie
youre the p
and youre the f
come on guys
big smiles for me
did you really work in a restaurant daddy
a long time ago
this is supposed to be a celebration
whats the greek word
is it opa
touch the vase
the family touch the vase and force a smile
mrs parrington is drying dishes
harry theo katie and james are at the table having supper
theo is on a laptop checking stock market trends
katie is texting
harry is reading congratulatory cards
congratulations from the prime minister
sir derek otterly was there today mrs parrington
i dont know him
you must remember him
hes been to the house
they all blur
thats because theyre all so dull
gold doing well
tech stocks down
dave enters and hands mrs parrington some empty mugs
nice one mrs p
oh thanks dave
would you like to stay for some supper
got some dinner at home
thats a nice vase isnt it
european entrepreneur of the year
did you g
get my cuttings
i did mate
its in the greenhouse
i got you a caryopteris and a philadelphus
see you later
see you tomorrow
what did papadopoulos sons borrow for the property development
about three hundred million
mrs parrington shuts and removes theos laptop
never mind the trials and tribulations of the stock market
finish your supper young man
eat up or therell be no pudding
ive made you a nice sponge
theo pulls a childish grimace and starts to breath heavily through his nose
two four eight
thirty two sixty four
something is happening with interbank lending daddy
well talk about it tomorrow
harry gets up from the table
its going to be a long summer
taking them to a business awards ceremony is hardly a family day out
my suggestion was a cottage in lyme regis
dave is at the front door in the hallway
he is putting on his muddy boots
i need to talk to you about james
look you really should be doing that at the back
he needs to complete his degree
and this gardening the horticulture the plants
its a huge distraction
i was just helping him out during the holidays
well i need him to complete his studies and youre diverting his attention
and frankly its not what i pay you for
dave doesnt answer
please dont be so churlish
you know if you were worked for my company youd probably be fired
is there anything else
james comes through the hallway
he has overheard some of the conversation and hes upset
he walks past harry and flashes him a dirty look
james now stops and returns to say something to his father
he takes a couple of deep breaths and composes himself
you need to learn how to
you really need to learn how to express yourself more calmly
james exits up the staircase
harry watches him
harry taps on james door
there is no answer
he walks in
can i come in
james room resembles a botanical garden
james is at his desk with pots of plants and various tools and test tubes with soil and desk lamps
james looks through a microscope studying a leaf ignoring his father
harry surveys the room trying to accommodate his sons interest in botany
he notices a poster of charles darwin with a quote
he reads it out
it is not the strongest to survive nor the most intelligent but those adaptable to change
latching onto a random plant ah
look at that
beat and thats
james answers without looking up from the microscope
did you know that the average garden contains over three and a half million species
no i didnt
im not going back to
but its only a year and then youve got a law degree
ive no intention of running p
i cant even pronounce it
finish your studies
its a hobby
give yourself options
you may change your mind about the business
you know there are a lot of creative roles now in business
defer the final year
take a year out why not
but dont quit
your mother would have said the same
well your mother would probably have said do what you feel was right but id argue she was wrong
and then wed argue
and shed win
that was your mother
at least consider deferring
james thinks about it
ill consider deferring
so there you are its not a definitely not
harry wants to bond but doesnt know where to start
harry latches onto an english ivy in a union jack plant pot
whats this one called
its an ivy
the doorbell rings
pause waits for a response mrs p
look id better
harry goes to exit and then comes back to shake his sons hand
harry heads towards the door and just before he exits he gives an emphatic double thumbs up
harry opens the front door
we see a friendly door to door salesman with a charity badge around his neck
he has a plastic basket of cleaning products
sorry to disturb
i work for a homeless charity
new dish cloths
i know how you people operate
i got a badge
harry studies the badge
no mention of a charity
come on boss
give us a break
im trying to earn a living here
got tea towels surface cleaners scrubbers brushes window sprays shammies for drying the car
theo appears at the door
you need to see the news
hello there mini boss
whos that man
he works for a charity
is it a cake sale
did you say cakes
did he say cakes
how do you know
thats what i want to do
open up a cake shop
cup cakes individually decorated gingerbread men bite sized apple strudels gooey fudge balls mini muffins as well as your traditional fare
got a business plan and everything
itll be egalitarian but feel exclusive sort of my mission statement really
the progressive peoples cake shop
thats very good
i know a thing or two about the food business as well
im looking for investors
retails not for me im afraid
theyll nick your cakes upset your customers then do you for wrongful dismissal
thanks for the encouragement
lets buy something
the news daddy
well how much for
its a shammy
its a shammy
im not going to say that word
because its a silly word and i dont know what its for and i dont know if youre genuine
and ill probably never use it
harry walks in with the entire box of cleaning products and hands them to mrs parrington
come look daddy
on the tv we see a new bank crisis
banner and a reporter standing outside a bank in the city of london
turn it up
theo points the remote and turns up the volume
panic confusion and chaos
they said it couldnt happen again but today it just did sending shock waves through the worlds markets
whats going on
another bank collapse
the tv images cut to people leaving an office with boxes of their belongings
all members of staff have been asked to leave while the bank is put into liquidation
it comes as a shock but not a surprise
harrys mobile phone rings
im watching now
i dont know
why dont you call them
ill see you first thing tomorrow
will this have repercussions on your loan
harry is lost in thought
thats a very good word theo
beat its a good word
its a very good word
we are at the papadopoulos sons hq the exterior of the factory
harry fat laki and nicholas are walking into the office
theyve revalued the property
theyre calling in the guarantees
you need to find thirty mil now
six months to find the rest
and if we dont
theyll put you and everything you own into administration
you took out crazy loans
our business is making feta cheese for gods sake
you gambled it on a shopping mall
i could do without these comments right now
im the finance director of this company harry
you never listened
it always had to be bigger better
like these offices
we didnt need these offices
do you know how much we paid for that work of art up there
two hundred grand
for a fish
nicholas points towards a fish hung across the wall
what do you want me to do nick
our business was profitable harry
i was going to retire in two years
id like to bring that forward
the accountants coming in
can you believe that
rob and sophie an american enter
shit fan and hitting
you know why they call this guy fat laki
fat laki indicates how big he once was
i stopped eating bread
its sad though
i loved bread
what can you do
this is sophie
just relocated from our new york office
really pleased to meet you
can i just say im a huge fan of greek food
especially the cakes
i love baklava
the ships going down and weve got baklava
i take it the banks are pulling the rug
what are the bastards proposing
theyve demanded the million we borrowed
thirty by close of play
sweet mother of god
they are sons of bitches
theyve taken a new position on the value of the property development
its triggered the guarantees
can you sell it
its not even a building site yet
so its bankruptcy
put something offshore i said
he wanted to pay his taxes
maybe i should have been more greek about it
its bankruptcy baby
when its good they get paid
when its bad they get paid
i want my son to be a lawyer for the same reason
he doesnt get it
so what are the options
well the obvious is to buy back your own business
trick is finding the investors to back you
and the banks will sell back to me because
because nobody makes pink slop like you do harry
the banks just want a quick sale
they have no interest in running your business
lets jump on it
ill talk to private equity firms vcs angels
the usual suspects
well find someone
what doesnt break you makes you
dont charge me for that will you
dont let her charge me for that
harry walks through his office and down to the factory floor where he overlooks a small army of oblivious papadopoulos sons employees processing taramasalata into containers
we see the front of the house
a standard removal truck is parked outside alongside the mercedes and a bentley sports car displaying papa and papa number plates
two removal men in white overalls and white gloves almost forensic looking walk out the front door carrying a large oil painting
a third man stands at the back of the van waiting to receive goods
katie walks down the stairs and we see removal men assessing the valuables of the house
the family including mrs parrington are in the kitchen
theo is on his laptop
katie nervously files her nails
mrs parrington has made everyone a cup of tea
harry is reading a newspaper
james is reading a book
theyre going through my things
are they darling
youll get it all back
two bank assessors rupert and nigel enter
rupert has a clipboard with items to be ticked off
nigel has a camera
under his breath problem
this is the
so how longs this going to take
most of the day i should think
and what are we allowed to keep
according to the asset sheet
not very much
little rats with their little claws
that is quite unnecessary katie
we may as well do this now
thats a nice computer
oh dont worry were not going to you know take it
theo hisses at rupert like a snake with an aggressive face
two four eight
double your numbers quietly theo and apologise or ill confiscate that wretched computer for a week
theres no easy way of doing this
you have impeccable taste by the way
its not mine
we operate very strict guidelines
we have your range of greek dips at home
dont we rupert
as i was saying we operate very strict guidelines
what is legally ours
well the bank will let you keep in cash
and youre each allowed in personal items
my westwood gold label cost more than that
its such a beautiful dress
i couldnt resist looking
i love it too
whispering ill sort something out for you
whispering thank you
you seem like such a lovely family
we hate doing this
right so k cash
and in personal items
one thing that came up in the meeting with hq this morning
the fish and chip shop
the three brothers
what fish and chip shop
that went years ago
well the bank is unable to seize it as an asset because of its co ownership with a
yes thats his brother
but they havent spoken in years
the family is sitting at the dining room table watching spiros eat
no one else is eating and the table is set for one
the dining room is spartan less furniture no pictures
we see some tea crates stuffed with tissue wrapped objects
it was so strange
oh james more lemon son
james passes spiros a small plate of quartered lemons
spiros sticks his fork into one and squeezes juice over his chicken
this is so good mrs p
in all the years i never stopped thinking about you or your food
still so charming
so im sitting there watching the telly and suddenly i see papadopoulos sons
on the tv
daddy over leveraged himself
look at this little englezo
im your uncle spiros re
im your uncle re manga
im going to eat him hes so cute
please dont eat me
hes just like his mother
a little englishman
thats because my mummy was english
i know re
im watching the news and im thinking whats my baby brother gone and done now
and just at that moment
as im thinking that thought in the same split second the phone rings
and its him
i mean its gotta be some kind of quantum physics there no
to katie katie
youre so grown up
i cant believe this
you were like
just a girl
dumpy and spoilt
look at you now
shes still a little spoilt
not so dumpy
sweet baby james
when you were three

we used to play fight
you loved to fight

to theo duck
i said duck
i know what you said

im so grateful
theres you know
i know theres so much that we need to sort out you and i
but we should be celebrating
i dont drink anymore
just so you know
but you dont have to be drunk to dance
thats what i say now
you dont have to be drunk to dance
were losing the house and well everything
its only temporary
im in negotiations with a top corporate finance team to buy it back
but in the meantime i need to free up some capital
ill give you whatever ive got but you know i dont have much money
i dont want your money spiro
i want to sell the three brothers
well split it
i get enough money pay the rent pay a few bills off and its great for you because you get some cash to do whatever it is you want to
you cant sell the three brothers
i knew it
i knew youd be difficult
i knew it i knew it i knew it
you havent changed
no it doesnt feel right
youre loving this
i want to help
cant you see were in the shit
may i suggest we sleep on this
before it gets out of hand
this is good advice mrs p
time lapse of evening into night
harry james katie theo and mrs parrington are sitting on a sofa
spiros addresses them
i couldnt sleep last night
not a wink
over and over in my mind i was trying to imagine selling the shop
something here was saying no no
i want to help you
all of you
so i prayed for guidance
i asked the universe
please help me
please help me help these people
and i mustve fallen asleep not long after
a crazy sleep
and then this dream
there was this this music
the most incredible music
and you and me harry
running the shop
i woke with tears in my eyes and i knew
what are you going on about
we are going to reopen the three brothers
is he talking about us
yeah i think he is
theres nothing there
wed get nothing for it
but if we made the three brothers great again
that is our destiny
it needs work
but destiny need work
youre still crazy
you have a better chance of getting through this if we increase the value of the shop
im not opening a fish and chip shop im papadopoulos sons im on supermarket shelves
what would i tell my friends
dont know maybe the truth
mimicking i dont know maybe the truth
hear me out
if we get it up and running again we can sell it as a going concern instead of an empty shop
this deal youre working on could take ages
in the meantime youre getting cash in and youre saving money because its got two bedrooms
the three brothers is a goldmine
used to be
can be again
when did you become so practical
ill get it fixed
im a handyman now
i thought you were a waiter spiros
around too much booze mrs p
i went travelling
belgium america brooklyn
i ended up managing a block of apartments in la
i do painting decorating plumbing electrics everything
a man who can fix things
ive got a van
its alright everyone
hes got a van
lets go look at the shop
let me go and start working on it now
youre out of your mind
i know what youre up to
you want to make some money for yourself
at least youre thinking smart these days
but dont involve us in all this
i want to help
given the current situation i think its worth consideration
im not opening a fish and chip shop
may i have a private word
youre behaving like a child
mrs parrington with all due respect
you are the father of this family
id rather boil my own head than go back to a chip shop
what a terrible thing to say
hes unreliable mrs p
hes irresponsible hes a talker
he plays the bongo drums
hes a waiter
hell drive us all mad and leave us broke
he seems reformed to me
he doesnt drink anymore
i think he wants to help
moving back to a chip shop will destroy my childrens confidence
seeing you behave like a spoilt brat will do that perfectly well
were going to smell of fish and chips
the children need a home
i dont give a fig for your bourgeois snobbery
look at you
everything has to be a drama with you greeks
show some gumption man
we see the family get into spiros tatty white van
spiros loads up some suitcases into the back
harry carries his businessman of the year award
james has some plants
theo has his laptop
katie has designer dress bags and shoes
on the side of the van we see the honest handyman with a telephone number and the strapline if its still broke
then we cant fix it
the logo is a hammer with angel wings
the van pulls out of the drive
the van pulls up in front of the three brothers fish and chip shop
the door is boarded up and covered in posters
we see the old sign the three brothers
the family still seated in the van stare out
so many memories
are we really going to live in that
im trying to find something good
youll love it
were going to have a crazy time
were going to fix this place up
im going to teach you how to do some greek dancing some singing
well fry some good fish
spiros exits the van leaving the stunned family in silence
across the road in the bogazi kebab shop hassan ali and mehmet his son are standing in front of the shop
they watch as the papadopoulos family exit the van
i dont believe it
the greeks are back
hello my old friends
find out what theyre up to
we are inside the three brothers
we hear a jangle of keys and the door opens
the family walk in led by spiros
katie still carries her designer clothes bags and shoes james carries some plants theo his laptop and harry walks in last
it is an old fashioned fish and chip shop that hasnt traded in years
it looks much worse from the outside
its actually a fish and chip shop
of course it is you spanner
theo picks out an old plaque mounted stuffed fish
this is mr charles
our lucky fish
he helped us make the busiest chip shop in london
spiros takes in a deep breath
i can smell the past
your father and i
making good money
its a crack den
let me show you the rest
well make it homely
furniture beds tv
let me show you
here is the prep room
the children follow spiros through the shop
harry is left looking at the place taking it all in
he takes out his mobile and calls
a phone rings at sophies office within mortimer rolf and jones harrys accountancy firm
mortimer rolf and jones

katie is outside the shop having a cigarette
we see mehmet approach

mehmet walks back to his shop
music athina athina by the trio attico
harry steps outside the shop
he looks at katie who is still smoking
he stands there for a moment looking a little lost
he gets into spiros van and drives away
harry drives to a cemetery
he parks the van and exits with flowers
harry walks through the cemetery
we see his wifes in loving memory of elizabeth papadopoulos devoted mother and wife
he lays down his flowers
sophie is at her desk
we see the same type of flowers in a vase as harry has laid down at the cemetery
the phone rings
mortimer rolf and jones
oh hi dad

just a second
thanks for the flowers theyre lovely
there was nothing wrong with new york

i love you
sophie puts the phone down
is matt your
a bit of a tosser yeah
i wouldnt say tosser exactly
we just wanted different things
yada yada yada
yeah i hear ya
its like me and my ex
she was keen and everything but i dont know her forward thinking sort of killed the romance
silence its good to have these little chats
shouldnt always be about work
society is so work obsessed
back to work
seated around a conference table is rob sophie and harry
harry studies a spreadsheet
some big names
pap sons is still a cash cow
whats the potential deal structure
thats the pisser
youd still be key to running the business but
money isnt cheap harry
these guys will want at least of the company
leaving me with nothing
id do the same thing
id be ceo of papadopoulos sons
get a salary
get my house back
my childrens future
it beats fish and chips
youd be working for someone else
id be working for someone else
by the way im not actually running a fish and chip shop
just helping my brother relaunch
listen there maybe another way
came up in conversation with the norske velconan bank
itd be along the lines of a straight loan to buy back the business
why would they lend me the money
lets ask them
want me to look into it
sure no choice
robs mobile alarm goes off
got to go
got an emergency with get this a high tech portable toilet company that has literally gone down the tubes
rob holds up a flyer for the company an internet ready wireless crapper with a waterproof keyboard and screen
for the love of god
because taking a dump needed an overhaul
still somebodys got to bury them
inomine patre spiritu sanctu
got to love a downturn
sophie starts to pack her files
i think what youre currently doing with your brother sounds liberating
im liberating myself of my last grand on a disused chip shop
but its like a startup
isnt that the most exciting phase of any venture
taking a bit of a risk
developing your products and your services
learning about your market
look some of the largest companies on the planet never make a profit
like a real profit
its all accounting tricks and leveraged debt
what im trying to say is does it matter if the business is a small one
as long as it makes a profit and the people who work there are happy
what are you doing working in a place like this
this is only temporary
i got divorced recently
came to london for a fresh start
im actually looking into setting up my own business
well im sorry about that
about the divorce i mean
ive been meaning to ask
can i come and visit your shop sometime
there isnt one
when its up and running
its a chip shop
on your feet all hours
verbal abuse from customers on a friday night
i wasnt applying for a job harry
just wanted to stop by
theo is in bed on his laptop
spiros knocks and enters
what are you doing little man
i watch trends
making trades based on patterns
i dont even look at the fundamentals
you know capital employed gearing ratios etc
not even turnover or profit
its short term but i can spot a trend
i know whats going to happen
so you can see the future
same as the past
the pursuit of order from chaos
im done for today
spiros takes the laptop and closes it
theo theo theo
you knew my mummy
she was beautiful
and she was very kind to me
i wish i had my mummy sometimes
its very hard for you
id have made her laugh uncle spiro
you make me laugh
ive come out with some classics
wasted on this family
you are something else
we can hear everything
katie and james are at the doorway
dont fall for him spiros
hes a little tinker
say the magic release poem
actually say it the magic release poem
theo papadopoulos is a hippopotamus whos always making such a fuss from his top to bottomus
katie and james tickle theo who squeals with delight
spiros opens the door on the sparse living room
harry is lying neatly in silk pyjamas in a sleeping bag on a camp bed
he is staring at the ceiling
ah your kids are something else
spiros undresses taking off items of clothes until he is down to his boxer shorts
spiros then gets out an icon of the virgin mary
he kisses it and then crosses himself three times
im not too religious
im a lapsed buddhist
i do everything a good buddhist does except abstinence
harry shuts his eyes and shakes his head in disgust
spiros then hands harry some ear plugs
spiros gets into the sleeping bag and turns off the light
this is a fantastic thing
did you ever imagine years ago
remember how excited we felt when we got this place
it feels like that again
my gut says
push alaskan pollock
what do you think
i should never have taken out that loan
well talk fish after we fix this place
singing well talk fish after we fix this place
katies got some good thoughts
says we should keep the old look
and she had some beautiful ideas about the uniforms
but then you know
the potential yield of the plaza
fully developed with a thousand year lease
i would have kept the freehold
im telling you spiro
it was good
id have been worth a fortune
worth i dont know
one billion five
one billion six
one billion six
big numbers spiro
big big numbers
spiros starts snoring
harry puts the ear plugs in and stares out into the darkness
we are in front of the shop
spiros addresses a small gathering of people who have turned up to help in the renovation
he holds a bottle of champagne
alongside him harry carries the box of cleaning products
we see james katie theo and mrs parrington
we see fat laki phil the till father jimmy a greek orthodox priest and an assortment of greek faces of various ages
we were children when we came to the uk with nothing
we start again
the weight you lost is an inspiration
phil the till
youve helped many greeks with your tax friendly till machines
eh only two things are certain in life death and taxes
unless youre greek
then its only death
the crowd cheer
nikos kyriaco androniki loula uncle panikos aphrodite maria and of course father jimmy
thank you thank you thank you
didnt father jimmy get done for selling illegal copies of rambo
hes got three liquor stores in palmers green
he always hated me
harry now addresses the small crowd
i just want you to know this is a temporary situation for the family
im currently in negotiations with a top corporate finance team about re acquiring the assets of papadopoulos sons
what did he say
hes had some sort of breakdown
spiros nods towards james who pushes a button on a his docked mp player
greek music oba oba ta bouzoukia by the delphi brothers
i officially announce the renovation of the three brothers
youre supposed to do that after you launch something
to hell with convention
spiros smashes the bottle on the floor and rallies the assembled party who cheer bravo and clap
montage to the same music
mrs parrington picks up a tray with teas and we follow her through the shop
she stops so that people can take a mug and we see her continue her journey all the way through the shop to outside where we see harry sitting alone
in the van
hes not part of the activity
we see scrubbing cleaning fixing
boards are taken down
inside we see people painting and the fish fryer cleaned
we see product displays go up
we see spiros with manic and crazy enthusiasm
james and katie messing around
finally we see father jimmy splashing holy water saying a prayer and making the sign of the cross over the fish frying range while others stand and watch the ceremony
he splashes water on those assembled
they wince as the holy water hits them
the music fades
fat laki is tasting strips of kebab meat
he is making notes as he does so marking for texture flavour etc
around him are spiros mrs parrington james katie theo and harry
hade re laki
dont rush me
its been a long time since i had meat like this
fat laki takes another bite and looks upwards as he chews
whats he doing
hes assessing the competition
e belame mas hes driving us crazy
theres a reason hassans still in business
texture very good
way above average
mechanically recovered cheap rubbish
this is a quality donner nicely cooked with all the right combination of herbs
it doesnt mean we cant take them on
im not saying we cant
mehmet walks into the shop and freezes
what do you want
thats a lot of greeks
katie grabs her coat
were going out
not too late
katie exits with mehmet
well she is
well make a better product at a cheaper price with larger portions
well lose money on the kebabs in the short term put turks out of business within a year make our margins on the fish and when the rest of this
crummy street has packed up well raise our prices and cut our portion sizes
the entrepreneur has spoken
hey its temporary but as long as were here well do some business
establishing shot of the finished gleaming shop at night
we hear the sound of a sizzling frying pan
we hear the crack of an egg
an egg being broken over chips and fish scraps
spiros is cooking
harry and james are sitting at a table
you know when he was a little boy hed come home from school and sit there just like that
who was the third b
he died in the fire
with our parents your grandparents in cyprus
in the war between the greeks and turks
how did you both escape
spiros climbed down and michael who was
dropped me down
i was just a baby
i caught him
i told mihalis to jump
he ran right back into the house
well never know why
one night and everything changes
he probably wanted to save his mum and dad
you know what
i never thought about that
you could be right
you are a wise boy james
your soul is old
this has always been a big question for me
for many years
do you think
do you think
i couldve done something else
you were holding a baby
and how old were you
i was nine
well you were only a boy
harry has stopped eating
he looks troubled
whats wrong with him
did i say something wrong
harry is lying on top of his camp bed
james knocks and enters with a cup of tea
he was only nine
i never thought about how young he was
i got you this
ive let you and your brother and your sister down
i made a promise to your mother that id take care of you
and youre doing that
this is humiliating for you
dad well get through this
i dont know
like king lear
i dont know the story
well king lear loses everything
absolutely everything and he finds himself in the middle of this storm with nothing and all his kids h
they think hes a prick
what happens to him
but it has to end like that because its a tragedy
im sorry about your plants
i can grow new ones
why didnt you bring more with you
i didnt want to get in the way
youre such a sweet boy
you get that from your mother
your stammer is getting better
you know what
im going to go and get your plants
from the house
im going to get your plants
like king lear
harry is back at the old house
there is an auction sign at the entrance
we see a skip
we see him peering in through a window
he walks over to the skip and looks in
he climbs in
inside the skip among old cardboard boxes a broken chair etc he finds a selection of plants some of them in pots
he picks one up the one with the distinctive union jack pot and brushes the leaves
we then see him walk off with a box of plants
spiros james katie and theo are making batter
it is late
they are all in their pyjamas
we see beer cans a vodka bottle and bags of flour
the radio plays greek music
harry enters carrying a cardboard box of plants
whats going on
were making b
uncle spiros special mix
thats all i could find
its very late
i said they could help
it is the holidays
theo gets upset
uncle spiros said i could make beer and vodka batter
it doesnt sound very good
you can stay up
its the holidays
tomorrow well look through the newspapers and pick out some stocks
how does that grab you
natural resources is a good buy
show us your frying skills
i was telling them how you were born with a timer in your head
how you fried to perfection every time
come on dad show us how to fillet a fish
go on daddy
the children join in
you should really be thinking about bed all of you
spiros tastes his batter and is happy
harry stares at himself in the mirror
he can hear muffled laughter from the rest of the family
harry is seated
he is fiddling with his suit and tie
he sees james pushing a wheelbarrow with plants smoking what looks like a joint
harry shakes his head
spiros gets in the van
alright thats it
where we going
get a loan
get the business back get the house back
does this suit look alright
its a suit
i dont know
it doesnt fit
as they are about to set off harry sees katie and mehmet kissing in the wing mirror
i dont believe it
in the street
theyre hanging out
are they screwing
theyre just kissing
ive got to get out of this place
hes a sweet guy
the family is in the gutter
youre overreacting harry
the thought of her pregnant
in a kebab shop
dont worry about katie
she can look after herself
spiros starts the van
we see it pull away
we now see the van driving through london before it pulls into an industrial estate and come to a stop
spiros turns off the engine
what are you doing
ive got something to say
is she pregnant
have youve got cancer
spiros pulls out eight or nine a pages of hand written notes
he takes out his reading glasses
reading the piece of paper
just bear with me
after years of abuse on my behalf and unacceptable behavior i reached a moment of clarity actually this was two years ago
reading id like to apologise for the hurt ive caused
reading there were aspects of my behaviour which were unacceptable
this includes and is not limited to
ive been carrying this
well if you dont want to hear we can do it later
now is fine
now is good
reading note paper and turning over pages oxi
beat i have abused your generosity
i agree with that statement
when we were children and got to london i looked after you
got you ready for school
made you do your homework
i taught you to cook ride a bike speak greek
beat why dont you speak greek re
you were reading your list
i fought with stephen klein when he accused you of stealing his orthopedic shoe
did you take it
you can tell me now
i didnt steal the shoe
are you going to read all of that
i dont have to
why did it go wrong with us spiro
we may as well get to it
why did you turn against me after i left the shop
i never turned against you
thats what it felt like
spiros puts the notes down
he takes off his glasses
i was jealous of you
you were my brother
brothers get jealous
you were more than a brother
you were my life and then you left
i set up the business
i wasnt going to stay in the shop
you couldve come with me
harry you were so fast
you were like a plane like a supersonic jet
but i gave you everything you wanted
did i ever once turn you down
in all the years after i left the business
and after it went bust
but it was never enough
every week something new
writing a cheque to
i dont know
you had some weird friends
who was that bloke with the pin head
kept turning up at the house
none of my friends anymore
and then drunk at elizabeths funeral
and your big tell it as it is speech
i heard about it
that was it for me
you were right to cut me off
she never had a bad word for you elizabeth
always forgave you
and she made me forgive you
i always had a way back when she was with us
elizabeth was so good to me
she was our world
she was our world
harry is chocked and is trying to hold it together
im sorry i cant
its okay h
ive got to get to this meeting
its an important meeting
its okay to miss her
silence just give me a minute
we see spiros solitary van parked up in ghostly industrial estate
the van eventually starts and pulls away
sophie rob harry and lars a scandinavian banker are sitting round the boardroom table
with the help of lars and the norske velconan bank we aim to buy pap and sons back from the receivers
also i have to say harry that i believe there is an intuitive bond between the greek and the nordic peoples yah
and so maybe the very first vikings were descended from ancient greeks somewhere in the deep mists of time
and so its so
so wagnerian yah
we should point out the new approach
to buy papadopoulos sons but divest the food manufacturing side of the business
divest the food manufacturing
what else is there
sell off the food but keep the property
its going to be worth a fortune
thats not what i had in mind
its an asset breakup
makes us sound like barbarians
with the new loan youd buy back your old assets and then sell off the brands in the pap sons stable
and you know how to squeeze the value harry
thats a break up
i know what it is
the pitta bread the cakes get sold to a bakery
the halloumi and feta to a dairy company
i love your halloumi
kisses air the sell off value of these brands will exceed the new loan
so my bank will get its money back faster than you can say knife
and what do you get
lars wants of the plaza development
which is what will remain after the debts have been settled
so you get of the development for free
but you get of the same development yah also for free
what do you want harry
i want my food business back
guy guys guys
its not going to happen
the best you can hope for is to work with lars here and save something
i cant say no
i need to take this to the board
take two three months
but pish yah
it seems criminal to buy the business back only to break it up
as an aside to sophie
can i just point out that you are skating
on thin fucking ice
ill do whatever the bank wants
harry we are going to take this to the hoop yah
harry and sophie are walking towards the lifts
taking out a loan to pay off a loan
so you can remortgage a property
its got nothing to do with business
its got nothing to do with making stuff
i get my life back
you get a loan for some land
my children get their lives back
this isnt very professional
do you give all your clients a hard time sophie
just the interesting ones
you got five minutes
just want to talk about the shop and make sure my brothers got the right plan before i go
lets grab a coffee
sophie and harry are strolling along londons south bank
so its on materials
the fish the potatoes the packaging etc
would you include energy
but not rent because we already own the building
and on labour
classic restaurant model
what are your weaknesses
the price of fish can vary
can you vary the menu
you dont want to complicate it
it doesnt have to be complicated harry
beat what are your fears
just that it just wont work out
that fish and chips has maybe had its day
hang on a second
they stop fish and chips is a british classic
its much more than just a quick meaningless experience
its something to be savoured
just think of the soft white cod flakes gently falling away as your fork pierces the hard crunchy shell of the golden batter
the rich smells of a fryers delight
the tangy smack of salt and vinegar on your lips
id pay for that
harry and sophie exchange glances
they hold a look we should talk about
we should talk about accounting packages
we should we see harry and sophie walk down south bank
mehmet and katie are kissing on a bridge
katie breaks away and stares into the distance
this time last year i was in malibu
well go tonight
its not a nightclub
the shops where im from but its not where im going to end up
my dad mustve said that to my mum once
maybe even on this bridge
look where he ended up
so whats your plan
got an eye for it
ill probably be a pop star one day
yo yo yo
its time to die
yo yo blue bottle fly
you is fat
you is bloated
you is fatally attracted
to my light bulb
that is well sick
i wrote something for you too
its a poem
its called sometimes i want for nothing else
just you and me
in an ever expanding universe
sharing a cup of tea
sometimes i want for nothing else
mehmet and katie start kissing again
food preparation montage
harry is filleting a fish
fish is being fried
potatoes are being sliced and fried
pickled onions are being poured into the european entrepreneur vase
the shop is being cleaned and the kids mess around
fish and chips are being prepared
outside the shop mrs parrington wearing a three brothers reopens tee shirt is promoting the shop by handing out some mini fish and chip samples to passers by
come and try
lovely hot chips
come and try
special chip for you
and one for you
fish and chips come and try
we batter our own fish
she serves an elderly english couple
she then serves a mum holding hands with a child with another child in a pushchair
a gang of asian school lads walk by
across the road we see hassan leave his shop and cross the road towards the three brothers
he is coming over to talk to harry
mrs parrington offers him some fish and chips
sir have a chip
have a fish
none for you
try come and try
harry and hassan are sitting in the living room
spiros sits between them
almost like a referee
hassan drinks a cup of tea
its not just fish and chips
theres room for all of us
what do you want hassan
remember when we were children
when we were friends
we werent greeks turks
respectfully i would like you to take your kebabs off the menu
this is a fish and chip shop
what do we get
i wont do fish
you dont do fish hassan
you are going to put us on the street
its not about business
perhaps you would not be like this if we were greeks
ill tell you what
well take kebabs off the menu if you ask your son to stay away from my daughter
hassan thinks about this
he sips his tea
this is very difficult
my son is his own man
theres no deal
is this because hes turkish
because hes a muslim
i dont have a problem with that
harrys not like that
because he works in a kebab shop
is that it
harrys more like that
i would ask you both of you to respect a mans aspiration for his daughter
i have similar aspirations for my son
spiro perhaps you should remind your brother where he is now
tell him to look around
perhaps he still sees a big mansion with gardens and servants
well i dont
but more importantly neither does my son
this is only
well be gone in a couple of months
i hope so
its going to be a very long couple of months
for both of us
hassan finishes his tea
there is an uncomfortable silence
at this moment theo comes in with a camera and takes a photo of the three men sitting together
the scene of the three men is captured as a still photograph
music lies by george zambetas
we now see a series of photo stills as you would find in a family album or on a rotating screen saver
the images cover over two months of activity at the shop and beyond
some of these shots are out of focus
some are over exposed etc
some are badly framed
sometimes the people in the shots are aware of being photographed sometimes not
they rotate once every four or five seconds throughout the song
the images we see are
katie dangling two fish from her ears as if they are earrings
mrs parrington behind the counter of the fish bar having a cup of tea
harry in his fish and chip shop coat and hat looking miserable behind the counter
james is sitting at one of the tables with half a dozen plants
he is repotting
katie and mehmet outside the shop having a cigarette
phil the till juggling potatoes
harry on the sofa fast asleep
jimmy the priest playing cards with fat laki and phil the till
he is showing the photographer his three kings while the other players look on bemused
harry with a tomato ketchup dispenser goofing around
mrs parrington and james present fat laki with a birthday cake
harry and sophie in the shop together having fun
the three children james katie and theo pulling a see no evil hear no evil speak no evil pose on a bench outside the shop
mrs parrington being embraced by spiros outside his van
mrs parrington and theo standing outside the shop pointing at something in the sky
katie and mehmet flirting outside the shop
sophie is sitting at a table eating fish and chips with
the entire family behind the counter posing for a shot as if for a local newspaper
harry and sophie sitting outside the shop smiling
spiros looking serious staring out of the shop window
a shot of harry and spiros outside the shop looking at at the camera
we are pulling out of the shot
spiros is happy and smiling but harry is stern and serious
this photo is held for longer
we pull out
theo looking at the same photo on his laptop
he closes the lid
the family is sitting at a restaurant area table spiros mrs parrington harry theo katie and james
on it there is a mobile phone
they watch it in silence

they do not talk
harry comes back

spiros shows some discomfort and starts to get up

spiros gets up where are you going

spiros collapses onto the floor
spiros is on an oxygen mask
harry katie james theo and mrs parrington are watching him

we hear the first bars of an inappropriate song
it wont turn off
youre such a spanner

i dont want to ask
oh for fucks sake ill go shall i
james exits and fetches a female doctor
i felt something just now
a gripping movement
no just a slight squeeze is that a sign
it could be a decorticate response
its difficult to tell
how longs he going to be like this
hes suffered a heart attack
its hard to predict
you should all take a break
im sorry about him
well leave you to it
well just say goodbye to uncle spiros
the family depart
sophie also goes to leave
would you mind staying around
we see the exterior of st thomass hospital in london from the other side of the thames river
harry and sophie sit at spiros side
it is late
harry is gently singing varka sto gialo a boat in the harbour to spiros a traditional greek song
he is humming the parts he cannot remember
so he saved me twice
once in the fire and once after the banks
i was always embarrassed by him you know
by his thing that he does
you know his
but the thing that he does
its a good thing really
these last few months
this year actually
this whole year
what a year

he closes his eyes and dies
fade from black
close up on harry who is sitting by himself
he has just come from the funeral and wears black
we see a hand on his shoulder
as the camera tracks back we see it is katies hand
she is also wearing black
he touches it
he is starring into the distance
katie sits next to him
james and theo appear also in black and sit next to katie
they stare into the distance
the camera continues to track back towards the entrance of the shop
james and harry climb up the stairs to the roof terrace
harry stops and stares in disbelief
we cut to harrys pov and see a beautiful roof garden packed with plants and life
did you do this
it was for you
and uncle spiros
thank you james
james points out the english ivy in the union jack pot that harry brought back from the old house
this is the ivy you saved that night
we meet again
katie and theo appear at the entrance to the roof terrace
did you know about this
they can all go back to the house if you want
theyre quite easy to move
but theyre also very happy to grow here as well
if we choose to stay
harry looks towards katie and theo
its whatever you want to do daddy
were all really proud of you
the family embrace
it is another working day at the three brothers
harry fat laki and james are behind the range frying and placing fried fish into the display
there are lots of customers queuing up and the restaurant is busy with customers at the tables
katie is taking an order
theo in a school uniform and mrs parrington walk into the shop
good day at school

your friends are outside
harry looks out of the shop window
harry exits the shop and is confronted by rob and sophie
as you wont come to me i thought id come to you
im not changing my mind rob
i just want to talk
harry rob and sophie are in a park sitting on a park bench
tell me this is a joke
i dont want to do the deal
harry you have seriously lost the plot on this one
it just doesnt feel right
we worked hard on this
if he doesnt want to do the deal he doesnt want to do it
no need for that
i dont understand

and that feels good
when i lock up my shop at night it feels good
ive got no debts no loans

harry starts to clap to the music
the others start to clap and form a circle around him
everyone enjoys the audacity of what harry is doing as he starts to dance by himself
people passing by stop to witness the spectacle
harry is in the middle dancing by himself
the camera pulls back as the party of people clapping come together in a circular farandole which takes over the street
theo is at one of the restaurant tables
he is trading on his laptop
mrs parrington comes into the shop
come and see your father
hes making the most delightful fool of himself
theo jumps down and runs out
we pick up the screen of theos computer
on it we see a trading screen with theos name a triple a status trader logo and a current account balance of million
