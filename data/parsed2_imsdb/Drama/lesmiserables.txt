written by william nicholson alain boublil claude michel schonberg and herbert kretzmer adapted from the stage musical les miserables based on the novel by victor hugo may the year is
the french revolution is a distant memory
napoleon has been defeated
france is ruled by a king again
rise up out of the iron grey surface of the ocean seething in the wind towards the shore
winter rain slices the air
ahead the port of toulon home of the french navy
a forest of tall masted warships
the great ships heave at anchor the wind whipping their rigging
through the sea spray we see the great ribs of warships under construction and warships being refitted
toulon home port of the french navy storm lashed sea and driving rain
a great wave rises up and hammers down
as it recedes we see the figures of men heaving on great ropes the sea water streaming down over their faces
the harsh storm light catches glints of metal these men are convicts chained by manacles heads shaved wearing red shirts with prison numbers crudely stitched onto them
now we see that the ropes run up to a ship that is being hauled ashore a storm damaged man of war its masts broken rising and falling on the
as yet another great wave rolls over the convicts we follow the straining ropes down into the base of the slipway and find the convict jean valjean up to his
waist in water chained by two sets of manacles as the rain and spray and wind scream round him
a great brute of a man he seems to feel nothing
the convicts sing in time with the rhythmic pulls on the rope ha ha ha ha look down look down dont look them in the eye look down look down
youre here until you die
no god above and hell alone below look down look down theres twenty years to go
the camera rises up to find javert the officer in charge of the convict workforce looking on his face rain lashed and expressionless
he stands above the men on the top of the dock as lines of convicts labour beneath him on the steep steps of the dock wall
behind javert through the storm rain we glimpse a forest of half built ships their ribbed frames like great skeletons in the mist
foreground convicts are at work on another ship that is almost completed labouring in the crashing spray
ive done no wrong sweet jesus hear my prayer
look down look down sweet jesus doesnt care
i know shell wait i know that shell be true look down look down theyve all forgotten you
when i get free you wont see me here for dust
look down look down dont lookem in the eye
how long o lord before you let me die
look down look down youll always be a slave
look down look down youre standing in your grave
with a last great heave the lines of convicts haul the damaged ship onto the slipway
the stern flagpole of the ship snaps in a vicious gust of wind and crashes down into the shallow water near valjean
javert sees and points his stick at valjean in silent command
valjean stares back for a beat defying him
then he drops down into the seething water and re emerges with the great mast in his hands held over his head
his head breaks water with his bitter gaze still on javert as he throws the mast ashore in a deliberate display of strength
javert nods to the guards and they begin to form the chained men into lines to return to their prison
the storm is passing now blown by the driving wind
javert approaches jean valjean
your time is up and your paroles begun
you know what that means
it means im free
it means you get your yellow ticket of leave
he hands valjean a folded yellow paper
this badge of shame youll show it everywhere
it warns youre a dangerous man
i stole a loaf of bread my sisters child was close to death and we were starving
you will starve again unless you learn the meaning of the law
i know the meaning of those nineteen years a slave of the law
five years for what you did the rest because you tried to run
my name is jean valjean
and im javert
do not forget my name
do not forget me
he strides away to command the lines of convicts as theyre marched away
valjean walks away hardly able to take in that he is free at last
the convicts sing as he goes
look down look down youll always be a slave
look down look down youre standing in your grave
valjean makes his way up a rising track a worn knapsack on his back
he comes to a stop at the top of the hill and there before him lit by the rising sun spreads a wide vista of fields and towns and villages
stretching into the distance with the snow capped alps beyond
behind and below him lies toulon at the seas edge
as we hear the musical theme freedom is mine we see for the first time the darkness in his face give way to a new hope
freedom at last how strange the taste
never forget the years the waste nor forgive them for what theyve done
they are the guilty everyone
the day begins more
valjean contd and now lets see what this new world will do for me
valjean strides down the long rising road pulling his thin coat close round him against the cold winter wind
he passes a long line of labourers working
he approaches the overseer
monsieur can i help
a days work
the overseer notices shaved hair showing under his cap
take your hat off
valjean takes his hat off revealing his shaved and scarred head
the overseer scans the yellow paper and hands it back
no work here
valjean slogs on up the rising track into the mountains
snow on the ground here and darkness falling
he looks up and sees ahead a village built on a rock cliff its lights twinkling the snowy mountains rising behind
the tower of its handsome church rises up like a promise of refuge
this is digne
valjean enters digne
as he drinks from the fountain he sees a guard standing outside the mairie
valjean stands waiting
the officer fastidiously writes down the name of valjean in his huge ledger and the name of the town in his passport
the officer signs and stamps the passport
the officer hands back the passport
valjean walks down the high street spies the warm glow of an inn and enters
valjean sits in the corner his hat low over his head
he eyes hungrily a group of cart drivers tucking into a roast meal by a roaring fire place
the innkeeper serves him a beer
as he reaches for it his coat sleeve rides up to reveal his wrist calloused and scarred by manacles
the innkeeper eyes him warily
he discusses valjean with two other men then asks for his paper
sees the phrase extremely dangerous
valjeans pov from the yellow paper in the innkeepers hands up to the innkeepers face
a blank stare a shrug of refusal
my inn is full
valjean moves off wearily through the village
as he passes down the narrow street faces peer at him from doorways but the doors close when he goes by
a shadowy figure follows him
word has spread that hes a dangerous man
passing the uncurtained window of a cottage he comes to a stop
through the window he sees a scene that breaks his heart a father at a table by lamplight his young wife before him his children on either side
nothing special and yet everything hes never had
he stops at the local jail
an iron chain attached to a bell hangs from the prison door
a grate slides open
would you let me stay here for tonight
this is a prison not an inn
get yourself arrested
then we will open up for you
the grate slides shut
as jean valjean walks away some children who have been following begin throwing stones at him
he threatens them with his stick and they scatter
he sees over a garden wall a low doorway in a stone turret
valjean stoops through the doorway and lies down on some straw
he hears a ferocious growl and sees the head of an enormous mastiff
it is a dog kennel
snow falling as valjean makes his way down the road hungry weary moving slowly his trousers ripped and bloody from where the dog has bitten him
at the end of a road the snow covered church beside it a dark churchyard
snow covered gravestones in moonlight
exhausted valjean collapses to the ground and huddles himself into the shelter of a doorway
a lantern glows in the dark
the lantern approaches throwing shadows
its little circle of light comes to rest on the crumpled figure of valjean
he stirs and opens his eyes
valjeans pov the glow of the lantern in the darkness
beyond it the half seen features of a kind old man
the come in sir for you are weary and the night is cold out here
though our lives are very humble what we have we have to share
bewildered fearful suspicious valjean gets up and goes with the bishop into the house by the church
a simple table on which is laid out bread and wine with silver cutlery
two silver candlesticks light the room illuminating walls painted with religious scenes
the bishop ushers the bewildered valjean into the room
the bishops sister madame baptistine stands
there is wine here to revive you
there is bread to make you strong
theres a bed to rest till morning rest from pain and rest from wrong
sit my brother
the bishop gestures to the housekeeper madame magloire
madame set one more place
to valjean please sit
the bishop gently takes his arm and draws him into a chair
valjean sits and the housekeeper lays food before him
famished valjean eats like an animal
the bishop says a short grace
may the lord bless the food we eat today
bless our dear sister and our honoured guest
to valjean please eat
where are you travelling to my brother
is that where your family is
the destination is compulsory
that is where the law sends me
i have no home
then let this be your home for as long as you need it
the bishop leads valjean to a bedroom where the walls are also painted with religious imagery
across the passage valjean sees the open door to the bishops own bedroom
there the housekeeper is putting the table silver away in a cupboard
he turns to see a bed made up with clean white linen waiting for him
he hasnt slept in such a bed ever in his life
but the bishop is smiling offering it to him
tomorrow morning before you leave you will have a cup of milk from our cows nice and hot
the bishop turns away to go to sleep
you let me sleep here next to you
how do you know im not a murderer
valjean laughs a strange laugh
god will take care of that
valjean lies on the bed fully dressed deeply asleep
outside a dog barks
valjeans eyes snap open
the first thing he sees by the light of the moon is an image of god the father gazing down on him from the painted ceiling
in panic fearing judgement he sits bolt upright
then he looks round and remembers
he gets out of bed and opens the door
there across the narrow passage the door stands open to the bishops bedroom
in the moonlight he sees the bishop lying asleep
above his bed the cupboard where the silver is kept
valjean moves silently into the bishops room holding a metal miners spike which he pulls from his bag
the floor boards creak
he looks down at the old man holding his breath but the bishop is peacefully and innocently asleep
he reaches up to the cupboard
it is unlocked
the cupboard door opens with a sharp cracking sound
the bishop disturbed in his sleep moves a little
at once valjean is over him like a wild animal spike raised to strike should he wake
the bishop sleeps on
the moon comes out and lights up his beautific smiling face
valjean is thrown
he turns back and opens the cupboard door fully there is the silver
carefully he picks it out fearful of every clink
one last look at the sleeping old man and he makes a run for the door
valjean rushes out of the back door of the house
he crosses the graveyard scrambles over a back wall and hes gone
the bishop is coming in from morning mass in his vestments when the door bursts open and two policemen drag valjean before him
valjean hangs his head unable to meet the bishops eyes
monsignor we caught the thief red handed
he has the nerve to say you gave him all this
he upends valjeans kitbag and the silver tumbles out
the bishop looks from the silver to valjean
that is right
amazed valjean looks up
but my friend you left so early you forgot i gave these also
would you leave the best behind
the old bishop is holding out the two silver candlesticks
to policemen messieurs release him
for this man has spoken true
i commend you for your duty now gods blessing go with you
silenced by the bishops gentle tones the policemen turn and leave
valjean utterly bewildered takes the silver candlesticks
but remember this my brother see in this some higher plan
you must use this precious silver to become an honest man
by the witness of the martyrs more
bishop contd by the passion and the blood god has raised you out of darkness i have bought your soul for god
valjean kneels in the church
he takes out his yellow passport and stares at it
he turns towards the altar and the crucifix above it
what have i done
sweet jesus what have i done
become a thief in the night become a dog on the run
and have i fallen so far and is the hour so late that nothing remains but the cry of my hate
the cries in the dark that nobody hears here where i stand at the turning of the years
if theres another way to go i missed it twenty long years ago
my life was a war that could never be won
they gave me a number and murdered valjean when they chained me and left me for dead just for stealing a mouthful of bread
yet why did i allow this man to touch my soul and teach me love
he treated me like any other he gave me his trust he called me brother
my life he claims for god above
can such things be
for i had come to hate the world this world that always hated me
take an eye for an eye
turn your heart into stone
this is all i have lived for
this is all i have known
one word from him and id be back beneath the lash upon the rack
instead he offers me my freedom
valjean contd i feel my shame inside me like a knife
he told me that i have a soul
how does he know
what spirit comes to move my life
is there another way to go
slowly he examines the yellow passport and raises it high as if to the altar
i am reaching but i fall and the night is closing in
as i stare into the void to the whirlpool of my sin
valjean stands and turns walking fast to the door of the church
ill escape now from that world from the world of jean valjean
jean valjean is nothing now
valjean comes out of the church into the graveyard and reaches a bell set on the edge of a promontory
below lies the steep drop down the mountainside to the dark valley below
another story must begin
he rips the yellow paper into pieces and throws the pieces out over the valley
the scraps flutter in the wind
follow the scraps of yellow paper as they dance in the wind then fall away into the void below
one scrap of paper dances upwards in the sunlight
we follow this and accelerate upwards leaving valjean and the town of digne far below towards the sun gloriously breaking through the heavens with the alps beyond
the camera then starts to tumble back down through mist and cloud below through time and space down to discover the camera hurtling towards three horses riding down a long
muddy road on a flat plain towards the walled town of montreuil sur mer
montreuil sits on an estuary leading out to the sea
we see ships sitting in low tide on the mud of the estuary along the dockside of the town and red brick factory buildings
eight years later montreuil sur mer
the camera closes in to ground level to reveal the horseriders javert flanked by two policemen
as the riders enter the walled town we see the poor clustered around the gates destitute and sick people clammering to get in
at the end of the day youre another day older and thats all you can say for the life of the poor
its a struggle
its a war
and theres nothing that anyones giving
one more day standing about what is it for
one day less to be living
javert sees the destitution of the people
expressionless as ever
at the end of the day youre another day colder and the shirt on your back doesnt keep out the chill
and the righteous hurry past they dont hear the little ones crying and the plague is coming on fast ready to kill one day nearer to dying
track past a plague victim wrapped in a shroud being thrown onto a cart
the police enter the harbour
the beggars are pushed back as the gates open and close for the police
at the end of the day theres another day dawning and the sun in the morning is waiting to rise like the waves crash on the sand like a storm
thatll break any second theres a hunger in the land theres a reckoning still to be reckoned and theres gonna be hell to pay at the end of the day
javert looks round at the factory buildings the boats in the harbour the poor clamouring behind him and rides on
heavy carts wait to be loaded with wooden crates of goods
workmen carry the crates out of the factory as the foreman strides in through the doors gesturing to a cart driver fauchelevent whos taking a quick rest on a crate
the foreman passes men packing boxes on tables and loading boxes onto crates
he passes through a door under a first floor office
the long work space is full of tables at which conservatively dressed women are working making jewelry out of shellac a black resin which looks like jet
an impressive sight obviously a very successful business
a wooden staircase climbs one wall to a glass windowed business office
the figure of a man within
flirtatiously to women at the end of the day you get nothing for nothing
sitting flat on your bum doesnt buy any bread
there are children back at home and the children have got to be fed
and youre lucky to be in a job the foreman has stopped beside fantine a pretty young woman
as he leans over to whisper in her ear fantine surprised pricks her finger with her needle
quietly to fantine and in a bed
to fantine as a warning and were counting our blessings
the foreman continues his rounds encouraging the women to speed up their work
at the end of the day just be glad to be working for a master who cares for the lives of the poor
hes a riddle
hes no fool
hes the answer to anyones prayer and he paid for the brand new school its no wonder they made him the mayor
bless the man who leads the way
at the end of the day
they get on with their tasks all glancing up at the boss in the office above
the foreman returns to fantine trying to help her
have you seen how the foreman is fuming today with his terrible breath and his wandering hands
its because little fantine wont give him his way
take a look at his trousers youll see where he stands
and the boss he never knows that the foreman is always on heat
if fantine doesnt look out watch how she goes shell be out on the street
the foreman rings a bell announcing the end of the work day
the women start to take off their overalls and pack up their tools for the day
at the end of the day its another day over with enough in your pocket to last for a week pay the landlord pay the shop keep on working as
long as youre able keep on working till you drop or its back to the crumbs off the table well youve got to pay your way at the end of the day
the women queue up to be paid by the foreman at the door
fantine has taken out a letter
the main factory woman snatches the letter away from fantine
and what have we here little innocent sister
the letter is passed surreptitiously down the line of women workers
come on fantine lets have all the news
reading dear fantine you must send us more money your child needs a doctor theres no time to lose
give that letter to me it is none of your business
with a husband at home and a bit on the side
is there anyone here who can swear before god she has nothing to fear
she has nothing to hide
the main factory woman starts to take fantines letter over to the foreman
fantine tries to get the letter back
the women scuffle
the owner enters the factory floor
we see him only from behind a well dressed prosperous man
what is this fighting all about
will someone tear these two apart
this is a factory not a circus
as he sings the camera moves round to discover him
clean shaven well fed transformed its valjean
now come on ladies settle down
i run a business of repute
suddenly valjean sees javert appear on the first floor balcony of his office
his world drops away
to the foreman deal with this foreman
be as patient as you can
he walks back to the stairs up to his office
on the factory floor now someone say how this began
the factory women all turn on fantine
at the end of the day shes the one who began it
theres a kid that shes hiding in some little town
theres a man she has to pay
you can guess how she picks up the extra you can bet shes earning her keep sleeping around
and the boss wouldnt like it
yes its true theres a child and the child is my daughter and her father abandoned us leaving us flat
now she lives with an innkeeper man and his wife and i pay for the child
whats the matter with that
fantine continues to defend herself to the foreman as the women sing at the end of the day shell be nothing but trouble and theres trouble for all when theres
trouble for one
while were earning our daily bread shes the one with her hands in the butter you must send the slut away or were all going to end in the gutter
and its us wholl have to pay at the end of the day
the foreman pulls fantine away
i might have known the bitch could bite
i might have known the cat had claws
i might have guessed your little secret
ah yes the virtuous fantine who keeps herself so pure and clean youd be the cause i had no doubt of any trouble hereabout
you play a virgin in the light but need no urging in the night
shes been laughing at you while shes having her men
shell be nothing but trouble again and again
you must sack her today
sack the girl today
right my girl
on your way
below fantine turns and calls to valjean in his office above with a pitiful cry
msieur mayor help me
i have a child
valjean hears the cry but he has other concerns
he turns round to face javert
javert stares at him
on the factory floor below the foreman hustles fantine out as she struggles against him
i introduce myself inspector of police
ive come to take the watch im here to keep the peace
please know me as javert
im here at your command with honour due to each
with justice in our hands no mans beyond our reach
let all beware
welcome sir come guard our laws im sure were here in common cause
javert turns to look through the high window onto the mens factory floor below
the last men are leaving for the day
youve done the city proud youve raised their banner high
javert contd you manufacture gems that anyone can buy your people thrive
valjean shows some demonstration samples of their work
the dignity of toil to stay alive
javert is puzzled
hes sure he recognises valjean but from where
it seems to me we may have met
valjean throws him a sharp glance
your face is not a face i would forget
a crash from outside in the yard shouts valjean and javert hurry out across the factory yard and down the muddy track beyond to discover a heavily laden cart has
toppled onto the cart driver fauchelevent the worker seen before taking a rest on a crate
the cart driver and the foreman are trying to lift the cart off the crushed man but its too heavy and the ground is too soft
fauchelevent screams as the cart slowly sinks in the mud
valjean javert and javerts assistant all hurry to help but they cant get a proper purchase in the spongy ground
all the time the cart is sinking further pushing fauchelevent deeper into the mud that will soon bury him
then valjean sees a way
at one end the wheels of the cart have stopped sinking the ground is harder here
he throws himself under the cart at this higher end and braces himself to lift it from beneath
it may fall
no monsieur le mayor
itll kill you as well
javert stands back and looks on
as he looks we see a memory stirring in him
javerts pov valjeans posture beneath the cart is exactly the same as the convict beneath the fallen mast
the same crouching power
the same almost suicidal determination
valjean sees javert looking at him and knows exactly what hes thinking
for a moment he hesitates
then he hears fauchelevents choking scream as the mud gags his mouth
valjean strains every muscle and slowly one end of the cart begins to rise
as soon as it clears the crushed and gasping man the others pull him clear
valjean lets the cart down again and climbs out
as he brushes himself down he finds javert staring at him
can this be true
i dont believe what i see
a man your age to be as strong as you are
a memory stirs
you make me think of a man from years ago a man who broke his parole
he shakes his head realising how absurd his suspicions are
forgive me sir
i would not dare say what you must
dont leave it there
valjean holds javerts gaze challenging him to say more
javert is not yet confident enough to continue
valjean goes to help fauchelevent
let me help you up
fauchelevent groans as he rises
monsieur le mayor you come from god
you are a saint
no more cart driving for you
he cant rid himself of his suspicion
monsieur le mayor
he draws himself up and gives a bow
as he walks away he discusses something with his assistant
fantine makes her way to the harbour wall
beggars shelter in the tunnels under the red brick buildings
fantine makes her way down wet slimy steps
this leads to an alleyway that runs down to the harbour and three ships lying on the mud at low tide
at the far end the largest is the rotting hulk of a vast old warship
a single whore sits in a doorway
excuse me is this where the pawnbrokers is
pointing its just there
drunken sailors spill out into the alleyway below
the first sailor is trying to find the whorehouse
i smell women
smellem in the air
think ill drop my anchor in that harbour over there
they spot fantine mistaking her for a whore
fantine presses on down the steps trying to ignore the sailors
love em till your broke
seven months at sea can make you hungry for a poke
the sailors then see whores start to appear from the shadows of warehouse doorways
even stokers need a little stoke
a man with no legs reacting to the sailors cranks up an organ grinder and from doorways and overhead windows harbour whores appear and tout for business
a man selling dentures stands by his cart and we hear fragments of his sales pitch
lovely ladies lovely dentures waiting for a bite
guaranteed to bite waiting for the customers they clean up real easy who only come at night
you can take them out at lovely ladies night ready for the call sell your teeth here make a standing up or lying down pretty sum or any way at
all best tooth man in the harbour bargain prices up against the guaranteed no painful gums wall
bargain prices up against the wall
during the above chorus fantine sells a locket containing a cutting of cosettes hair to the pawnbroker
hello sweetheart ill give you four francs
its worth at least ten
the pawnbroker goes back in his shop and fantine watches the whores
the pawnbroker takes the locket in exchange for the money
an old woman leers at fantine from the shadows beckoning
she approaches fantine reaching out to stroke her hair
what pretty hair
what pretty locks youve got there
what luck you got
its worth a centime my dear
ill take the lot
dont touch me
leave me alone
lets make a price
ill give you all of ten francs
just think of that
it pays a debt
just think of that
what can i do
it pays a debt
ten francs may save my poor cosette
the hair crone leads fantine down to her shop at the base of the stairs
fantine is sat on a low stool
she bows her head before the hair crone who at once whips out a razor blade and cuts off her hair at the roots
fantine walks down the steps with short hair mocked by the voices of the whores on either side
a pimp and the head whore watch her progress as the organ grinder grinds out the music
whores sing from the warehouse doorways from on top of the spars of the ships writhing around figureheads and from the rotting ship
the few men in the street choose their whores and disappear by the end of the chorus
lovely ladies lovely dentures guaranteed to waiting in the dark
bite ready for a thick one they clean up real easy or a quick one in the park
you can take them out at night head whore lovely teeth dear shining long time short time like the stars anytime my dear
ill whip em out quite cost a little extra quickly if you want to take all year and i wont leave any scars
quick and cheap is underneath the pier fantine reaches the hair crone
please you wouldnt have any work for me would you
please i sold you my hair
i could do anything
the hair crone points at the head whore and the tooth man
go and see them
fantine looks towards the tooth man and the head whore
come over here come here my dear
ill pay well for your youth
i pay ten francs for a tooth
fantine heads to the tooth man
you have my dear the clear advantage of youth
whispers just the back ones
the pain wont last youll still be able to bite
she grabs fantines cheeks and forces open her mouth to inspect her teeth
i do it fast i know my business all right
its worth a go
the pimp pushes her down
youll pay me first what i am due
youll get twice if i take two
she opens her mouth and the pincers go in as everyone gathers round to watch
fantine screams as the first tooth is removed
the pimp is passing among the whores checking that theyre all fit for business
god were weary sick enough to drop
belly burns like fire will the bleeding ever stop
cheer up deary
show a happy face
plenty more like you here if you cant keep up the pace
deary knows her place
the pimp gestures at fantine now slumped in a doorway her cropped head in her hands
a shy captain watches fantine
the pimp notices
gimme the dirt whos that bit over there
a bit of skirt shes the one sold her hair
shes got a kid sends her all that she can
i mightve known there is always some man
he moves in on fantine
lovely lady come along and join us
fantine looks up a trickle of blood in one corner of her mouth
the whores cluster round her hands reaching out to draw her in to their world
on the rotting warship more whores appear out of the gaps of the hull to sing the chorus
come on dearie why all the fuss
why all the fuss
youre no grander than the rest of us
than the rest of us
life has dropped you at the bottom of the heap
at the bottom of the heap
whore bites her fingertip and applies her blood to rouge fantines cheeks
join your sisters make money in your sleep
make money in your sleep
thats right dearie show him what youve got
show him what youve got
thats right dearie let him have the lot
let him have the lot
the whores perform for the benefit of fantine on the orders of the head whore as the head whore leads her towards the hulk
old men young men takeem as they come
harbour rats and alley cats and every kind of scum
poor men rich men leaders of the land see them with their trousers off theyre never quite as grand
all it takes is money in your hand
the pimp leads the captain down the middle of the whores to fantine who wears a filthy white dress
the pimp joins the captain and fantines hands as the head whore officiates like a twisted wedding ceremony
lovely ladies going for a song more
whores contd got a lot of callers but they never stay for long
fantine puts on a show of courage as she leads the captain into the ships hulk which is a brothel
come on captain you can wear your shoes
dont it make a change to have a girl who cant refuse
fantine pale and frail her bodice loosened leads the captain down to the damp dregs of the ship
we see the rotting straw mattress within as they enter then fantine lays down
easy money lying on a bed
just as well they never see the hate thats in your head
dont they know theyre making love to one already dead
close on a mans hand leaving money
we hear him exit
move to find fantine lying alone on the mattress
she pulls herself into a sitting position against the head of the mattress
she draws her legs up and wraps her arms round her knees huddling against the misery of the world
there was a time when men were kind when their voices were soft and their words inviting
there was a time when love was blind and the world was a song and the song was exciting
there was a time
then it all went wrong
i dreamed a dream in time gone by when hope was high and life worth living
i dreamed that love would never die
i dreamed that god would be forgiving
fantine contd then i was young and unafraid and dreams were made and used and wasted
there was no ransom to be paid no song unsung no wine untasted
but the tigers come at night with their voices soft as thunder as they tear your hope apart as they turn your dream to shame
he slept a summer by my side he filled my days with endless wonder
he took my childhood in his stride but he was gone when autumn came
and still i dream hell come to me
that we will live the years together
but there are dreams that cannot be and there are storms we cannot weather
i had a dream my life would be so different from this hell im living so different now from what it seemed
now life has killed the dream i dreamed
as she ends her song her next customer is waiting
the head whore beyond
fantine is out on the snow and ice covered quayside shivering waiting for trade
she looks pale and sickly but still attempts an alluring smile
she moves past the anchored ships beneath the bowsprits trying pathetically to attract custom
then she comes to a stop staring
she has seen and recognised valjean some way off
hes out in the harbour district
he is talking to a beggar
before he moves on he hands over some money
as fantine watches valjean on his mission of mercy a well dressed young man bamatabois comes up to her
he arrives with two friends and a valet
heres something new
i think ill give it a try
come closer you
i like to see what i buy
the usual price for just one slice of your pie
i dont want you
let me go
is this a trick
i wont pay more
no not at all
youve got some nerve you little slut
youve got some gall
its the same with a tart as it is with a grocer the customer sees what he gets in advance its not for the whore to say yes sir or
no sir its not for the harlot to pick and to choose or to lead me a dance
he pulls her clothing open and laughingly stuffs snow down her cleavage
fantine reacts with fury
they fall over in the snow and bamatabois laughs
ill kill you you bastard
try any of that
even a whore who has gone to the bad wont be had by a rat
fantine scratches bamatabois across the face
bamatabois touches his face and sees the blood on his fingers
his friends drag fantine against the harbour wall
furious but aroused by christ youll pay for what youve done
this rat will make you bleed youll see
i guarantee ill make you suffer
for this disturbance of the peace for this insult to life and property
bamatabois suddenly sees that police have arrived
i beg you dont report me sir
ill do whatever you may want
make your excuse to the police
bamatabois friend drags fantine towards the police
tell me quickly whats the story
who saw what and why and where
let him give a full description let him answer to javert
in this nest of whores and vipers let one speak who saw it all
who laid hands on this good man here
whats the substance of this brawl
javert would you believe it
i was walking it was dark when this prostitute attacked me you can see shes left her mark
he shows the blood
javert turns to fantine
she will answer for her actions when you make a full report
you may rest assured msieur that she will answer to the court
fantine is almost fainting with fear still racked with occasional spasms of coughing
unseen by her valjean is approaching from behind
javerts assistants pick fantine up
javert covers his mouth with a handkerchief as he approaches fantine
theres a child who sorely needs me please msieur shes but that high
holy god is there no mercy
if i go to jail shell die
i have heard such protestations every day for twenty years
lets have no more explanations more
javert contd save your breath and save your tears
javert indicates to the two policemen to drag fantine away
valjean steps out of the shadows
a moment of your time javert
i do believe this womans tale
monsieur le mayor
youve done your duty
let her be
she needs a doctor not a jail
monsieur le mayor
javert looks on containing his anger as valjean reaches out a hand to fantine
to fantine its as if hes come to her in a dream can this be
where will she end this child without a friend
he holds fantines hands looking into her face
ive seen your face before
show me some way to help you
how have you come to grief in such a place as this
msieur dont mock me now i pray its hard enough ive lost my pride
you let your foreman send me away
yes you were there and turned aside
i never did no wrong
is it true what ive done my daughters close to dying
to an innocent soul
if theres a god above had i only known then
hed let me die instead
in his name my task has just begun
i will her to the hospital
valjean picks fantine up in his arms
javert is quietly coldly furious
monsieur le mayor
bring cosette back to me
where is she
at an inn in montfermeil
monsieur le mayor
i will see it done
i will send for her immediately
as valjean and fantine move away javert stares after them then turns and quietly instructs his assistant to follow after them
as javert walks up the steps to his police station his assistant stops him with an urgent letter
from paris monsieur
javert seizes it opens it and reads
as he reads his expression changes
appalled he realizes hes made a terrible mistake
valjean is at his desk in his office going through his papers once everyone else has gone when javert enters and stands before him
he looks up
monsieur le mayor i have a crime to declare
i have disgraced the uniform that i wear
ive done you wrong let no forgiveness be shown
ive been as hard on every rogue i have known
ill bear the blame i must be treated just the same
i dont understand
what is this crime javert
i mistook you for a convict i have made a false report
now i learn theyve caught the culprit hes about to face the court
valjean conceals his shock
and of course the thief denies it youd expect that from a con
but he couldnt run for ever no not even jean valjean
you say this man denies it all and gives no sign of understanding or repentance
you say this man is going to trial and that hes sure to be returned to serve his sentence
he will pay and so must i
press charges against me sir
you have only done your duty its a minor sin at most
all of us have been mistaken youll return sir to your post
must i do as you say
its your duty to obey
javert is about to protest again but valjean raises one commanding hand to indicate his decision is made
javert gives an abrupt bow and departs
left alone valjean paces his office deeply disturbed
they think that man is me without a second glance
this stranger they have found this man could be my chance
why should i save his hide
why should i right this wrong
when i have come so far and struggled for so long
if i speak i am condemned
if i stay silent i am damned
he goes out onto the balcony that looks down on the empty factory
i am the master of hundreds of workers they all look to me
can i abandon them
how would they live if i am not free
if i speak they are condemned
if i stay silent i am damned
valjean is sitting staring at the bishops candlesticks
who am i
can i condemn this man to slavery
pretend i do not feel his agony
this innocent who bears my face who goes to judgement in my place
who am i
valjean is furiously packing stuff up
can i conceal myself for ever more
pretend im not the man i was before
and must my name until i die be no more than an alibi
close on two horses panting
a stopped carriage in a wide night landscape
the driver is valjean hesitating
must i lie
how can i ever face my fellow men
how can i ever face myself again
valjean hesitates outside the courtroom and in the lobby of the courtroom pacing back and forth
my soul belongs to god i know i made that bargain long ago
he gave me hope when hope was gone
he gave me strength to journey on
who am i
who am i
im jean valjean
valjean pushes through the crowds at the back of the courtroom
the man accused of being jean valjean a wretched down and out stands before the judge
he looks uncannily like the real valjean
before the judge has a chance to speak the doors open and valjean bursts in
sensation in the court
and so your honour you see its true that man bears no more guilt than you
who am i
the judge is too stunned to respond
the others in the court cant believe what theyve just heard
the mayor of montreuil sur mer a convict
if you dont believe me ask inspector javert
he knows where to find me
the judge goes over to valjean and gently leads him out
monsieur le mayor you are not well you must come with me do you have a carriage outside
monsieur le mayor we must get you home to bed immediately
the hospital is in the long attic of valjeans factory
valjean hurries into the hospital breathless
he sees a nursing sister outside fantines room
is her daughter with her
her guardian sent this
she gives valjean a note
he reads it with mounting anger
money not enough
what sort of man is this
fantine lies in bed delirious
she is dressed in pure white
her eyes are closed
cosette its turned so cold
cosette its past your bedtime
youve played the day away and soon it will be night
fantines eyes open and she sees cosette playing in the room
she looks healthy and is dressed prettily
come to me cosette the light is fading
fantine contd dont you see the evening star appearing
come to me and rest against my shoulder how fast the minutes fly away and every minute colder
valjean enters and sees at once that fantine is close to the end
he drops to his knees by her bed
dear fantine cosette will be here soon
dear fantine she will be by your side trying to get out of bed come cosette the night has grown so cold
putting her back in bed be at peace
be at peace ever more
my cosette shall live in my protection
take her now
she pushes into his hand a scrap of paper on which shes written her wishes
your child will want for nothing
good msieur you come from god in heaven
and none shall ever harm cosette as long as i am living
fantine has stopped looking towards the window
all her fading strength is now directed towards valjean
she tries to reach up to him
take my hand
the night grows ever colder
then i will keep you warm
he wraps her in his arms
take my child i give her to your keeping
take shelter from the storm
for gods sake please stay till i am sleeping
and tell cosette i love her and ill see her when i wake
fantine starts to spasm
she sees something over valjeans shoulder
valjean doesnt realise
her eyes go glassy as she passes away
valjean then hears the unforgettable voice of javert behind him
valjean at last we see each other plain
msieur le mayor youll wear a different chain
valjean stands to face javert
before you say another word javert before you chain me up like a slave again listen to me
there is something i must do
this woman leaves behind a suffering child
there is none but me who can intercede in mercys name three days are all i need then ill return i pledge my word
then ill return
javert draws his sword and aims it at valjean
you must think me mad
ive hunted you across the years
men like you can never change a man such as you
valjean breaks a section of timber beam from the roof
the men start to circle each other
they sing at the same time duelling in song
believe of me what you will there is a duty that im sworn to do
you know nothing of my life all i did was steal some bread
you know nothing of the world you would sooner see me dead
but not before i see this justice done
men like me can never change
men like you can never change
my duty is to the law
you have no rights
come with me
the two men fight
i am warning you javert im a stronger man by far
there is power in me yet
my race is not yet run
now the wheel has turned around jean valjean is nothing now
dare you talk to me of crime and the price you had to pay
every man is born in sin every man must choose his way
javert disarms valjean and drives him backwards towards an attic door
you know nothing of javert
i was born inside a jail
i was born with scum like you
i am from the gutter too
valjean is pushed through the doors out onto a wooden loading platform beneath a hoist
below the walls of the factory lead straight down to the black sea at high tide
javert is triumphant
valjean glances down and pushes back dropping into the darkness of the ocean
javert goes to jump after him and cannot bring himself to do it
javert stares into the black sea there is no sign of valjean
javert and various police search the harbourside with lanterns
valjean dripping wet watches from a tunnel under a factory as fantines body wrapped in a shroud is dumped on a cart
they sing to themselves continuing their duet without knowing
and this i swear to you tonight there is no place for you to hide
your child will live within my care wherever you may hide away and i will raise her to the light
i swear to you i will be there
the village street is bright with booths set up for a frost fair
families and visitors are out buying baubles or laughing at the antics of travelling players
small girls cluster round a stall that displays prettily dressed dolls
amongst them is a prettily dressed girl of or years across the road from this stall stands a shabby inn
a sign lashed to an old cart swinging in the wind reveals the inn to be the sergeant of waterloo
the inn is still closed despite the small crowd at the fair
move in on the frosted window of the inn through which we see a little girl cosette gazing out at the display of dolls
cosette is in the process of sweeping the floor
shes come to a stop gazing out of the window mesmerized by the sight of the most beautiful doll in the display and jealous that eponine can see it and
touch it up close
there is a castle on a cloud i like to go there in my sleep
arent any floors for me to sweep not in my castle on a cloud
cosette gets out from a hiding place in the wall a knotted grimy rag this is her doll the knot is the dolls head
there is a lady all in white holds me and sings a lullaby
shes nice to see and shes soft to touch holding doll to her ear and whispering she says cosette i love you very much
i know a place where no ones lost i know a place where no one cries
crying at all is not allowed not in my castle on a cloud
madame thenardier comes bustling down the stairs in a bad mood
she glowers at little cosette and changes the closed sign from closed to open
now look whos here
the little madam herself pretending once again shes been so awfully good
better not let me catch you slacking
better not catch my eye
ten rotten francs your mother sends me what is that going to buy
now take that pail my little mademoiselle and go and draw some water from the well
we should never have taken you in in the first place how stupid the things that we do
like mother like daughter the scum of the street
cosette goes to put the broom away
eponine comes in from outside
eponine come my dear
eponine let me see you
you look very well in that little blue hat
theres some little girls who know how to behave and they know what to wear and im saying thank heaven for that
madame thenardier sees that cosette far from going is hiding behind the far wall
we see cosettes frightened eyes peering out from a tiny gap in this wall
still there cosette
your tears will do you no good
i told you to fetch some water from the well in the wood
singing through the gap please do not send me out alone
not in the darkness on my own
madame thenardier imitates cosette as she sings
singing through the gap enough of that or ill forget to be nice
you heard me ask for something and i never ask twice
the innkeepers gang posing as customers who have been loitering outside come in explaining to a fifth man who is a newer recruit a story from monsieur thenardiers past
madame thenardier goes outside to open up the rather pathetic frost fair stall on the porch of the inn
mine host thenardier he was there so they say at the field of waterloo
got there its true when the fight was all through but he knew just what to do
crawling through the mud so ive heard it said more
customer contd picking through the pockets of the english dead
he made a tidy score from the spoils of war
we suddenly hear the voice of the landlord thenardier
he has been there all the time asleep on a bench
he wakes from his drunken slumbers and roars out my band of soaks my den of dissolutes my dirty jokes my always pissed as newts my sons of whores spend
their lives in my inn
homing pigeons homing in they fly through my doors and their moneys as good as yours
madame thenardier is trying to sell something unappealing from her stall to a portly looking man when slushy snow from the stalls roof falls on the mans head
madame thenardier ushers him inside
sit yourself down and meet the best innkeeper in town
madame thenardier pretends to accidentally drop a comb from her hair and the customer helpfully picks it up allowing madame thenardier to pick his wallet from a back pocket as
he stands up
monsieur thenardier takes his coat which allows the couple to see the customer transfer a pocket watch from coat to jacket pocket
as for the rest all of them crooks rooking the guests and cooking the books
seldom do you see honest men like me a gent of good intent whos content to be he pours a strong drink for the new customer
master of the house
doling out the charm ready with a handshake and an open palm thenardier has thieved the pocket watch using his handshake as a distraction
he passes this off to madame thenardier
tells a saucy tale makes a little stir customers appreciate a bon viveur glad to do a friend a favour doesnt cost me to be nice but nothing gets you
nothing everything has got a little price
master of the house
keeper of the zoo
ready to relieveem of a sou or two serving wine watering the wine thenardier is pissing into the very wine bottle hes using to serve the customer
making up the weight picking up their knick knacks when they cant see straight everybody loves a landlord everybodys bosom friend
i do whatever pleases jesus
wont i bleedem in the end
at madame thenardiers stall a frost fair customer is covered by snow only this time we realise madame thenardier is responsible for pushing the snow off the awning with a
master of the house
quick to catch your eye more
thenardier customers contd never wants a passer by to pass him by
madame thenardier ushers the customer inside
again madame thenardier drops her comb in front of the new customer but this time the thieving is foiled by little cosette who helpfully picks it up
over the chorus she shouts at little cosette to get out
servant to the poor butler to the great comforter philosopher and lifelong mate everybodys boon companion everybodys chaperone but lock up your valises jesus
wont i skin you to the bone
a family enters the inn
thenardier fusses over them
lay down yer load unlace yer boots and rest from the road
this weighs a ton travels a curse but here we strive to lighten your purse
hes got the fathers purse out and is removing notes
here the goose is cooked here the fat is fried and nothings overlooked till im satisfied food beyond compare food beyond belief thenardier shows off the secrets of the squalid
kitchen every possible animal being used to make mince meat
mix it in a mincer and pretend its beef kidney of a horse more
thenardier v o contd liver of a cat filling up the sausages with this and that
thenardier serves the disgusting food that weve seen him create in the flashback to the family
residents are more than welcome bridal suite is occupied a groom and bride consummate their union
thenardier is going through the grooms trousers
reasonable charges plus some little extras on the side
chargeem for the lice extra for the mice two percent for looking in the mirror twice
here a little slice there a little cut three percent for sleeping with the window shut
when it comes to fixing prices there are lots of tricks he knows how it all increases all those bits and pieces jesus
its amazing how it grows
thenardier comes out of the inn backed by a posse of his gang of loyal customers and takes control of a brass band to sing to the frost fair
master of the house
quick to catch your eye never wants a passer by to pass him by
further down the street carrying her empty buckets cosette turns to look sadly back at the cheery sight
servant to the poor butler to the great comforter philosopher and lifelong mate everybodys boon companion givesem everything hes got the portly customer has discovered hes been robbed
he comes out to protest holding out his emptied wallet
at once two of thenardiers thugs grab him and hustle him off
dirty bunch of geezers jesus
what a sorry little lot
madame thenardier approaches a handsome soldier who is drinking at a table by the fire in the inn
she sits on his lap and gets him to look back at thenardier so allowing her to see inside his coat and spot his wallet
i used to dream that i would meet a prince but god almighty have you seen whats happened since
master of the house isnt worth my spit
comforter philosopher and lifelong shit
cunning little brain regular voltaire thinks hes quite a lover but theres not much there
as madame thenardier reaches for the mans groin she lifts his wallet skillfully and hands it off to monsieur thenardier
what a cruel trick of nature landed me with such a louse
god knows how ive lasted living with this bastard in the house
she pulls the young man into a dance enabling her to steal everything else of value he has
father christmas has also been lured from the frost fair and the thenardiers slit his presents sack and exchange it for a sack containing snow
master of the house
master and a half
comforter philosopher dont make me laugh
servant to the poor butler to the great hypocrite and toady and inebriate
everybody bless the landlord
everybody bless his spouse
everybody raise a glass
raise it up the masters arse
everybody raise a glass to the master of the house
cosette has filled her buckets at the well in the wood and is now heading back
through the dark trees ahead we glimpse the cheerful lights of the frost fair and the distant inn
she goes slowly because the buckets are heavy
she hums to herself to keep her spirits up a wordless verse of castle on a cloud
after a few steps she pauses to rest the weight of the buckets
strong arms reach for the buckets and lift them out of her hands
she looks up amazed
hush now do not be afraid of me
show me where you live
valjean contd tell me my child what is your name
im called cosette
she gazes up at him
hardly knowing why the little girl trusts this stranger
valjean picks up the heavy buckets and they head back towards the inn
as they go they hum castle on a cloud together
valjean enters with cosette
madame thenardier hurries over
madame and monsieur thenardier try to thieve from valjean using the same tricks established earlier but he evades every attempt
eponine watches silently from a corner
i found her wandering in the wood this little child i found her trembling in the shadows
and i am here to help cosette and i will settle any debt you may think proper
i will pay what i must pay to take cosette away
this is a duty i must heed
there is a promise i have made
for i was blind to one in need i did not see what stood before me
now your mother is with god
her suffering is over and i speak here with her voice and i stand here in her place and from this day and ever more let me take your coat
cosette shall live in my protection
you are very welcome here
i will not forget my vow
take a glass
take a chair
cosette shall have a father now
thenardier turns to his wife
what to do
what to say shall you carry our treasure away
what a gem
what a pearl
beyond rubies is our little girl
how can we speak of debt
lets not haggle for darling colette
cosette dear fantine gone to rest have we done for her child what is best
shared our bread shared each bone treated her like shes one of our own
like our own msieur
your feelings do you credit sir
and i will ease the parting blow
let us not talk of bargains and bones and greed
he gives thenardier money
now may i say we are agreed
that would quite fit the bill if she hadnt so often been ill
little dear cost us dear
medicines are expensive msieur
not that we begrudged a sou its no more than we christians must do
valjean gives more money
one thing more
one small doubt
there are treacherous people about
your intentions may not be correct
valjean hands over more money
heres your price
fifteen hundred for your sacrifice
come cosette say goodbye
lets seek out some friendlier sky
thank you both for cosette it wont take you too long to forget
he leads cosette to the door
valjean lifts cosette into the waiting cab
where i go you will be
will you be like a papa to me
this is true
ill be father and mother to you
the cab sets off down the road
madame thenardier takes the bunch of notes from her husbands hand and inspects them
through the open door thenardier sees a man on horseback rattling up to the inn
theres a copper at the door
what the devil have you done
javert strides into the inn
wheres the child cosette
shes gone with a gent didnt tell us where they went didnt leave his home address
did you catch the fellows name
both thenardiers shake their heads
javert stares once contemptuously round the seedy inn and departs without a further word
thenardier goes to the doorway to watch him leave
youre a bloody fool look at what we got
should have struck the iron struck it while its hot
next time round well be here and were gonna get the lot
valjeans cab moving fast passes down the road into the city
in cab valjean has one arm round cosette to protect her from the jolting of the cab
he gazes at her as she slips into a fitful sleep
suddenly i see suddenly it starts when two anxious hearts beat as one
yesterday i was alone today you walk beside me something still unclear something not yet here has begun
suddenly the world seems a different place somehow full of grace more
valjean contd and delight
how was i to know that so much love was held inside me
something fresh and young something still unsung fills the night
how was i to know at last that happiness can come so fast
trusting me the way you do im so afraid of failing you just a child who cannot know that danger follows where i go there are shadows everywhere and memories
i cannot share nevermore alone nevermore apart you have warmed my heart like the sun
you have brought the gift of life and love so long denied me
suddenly i see what i could not see something suddenly has begun
he brushes the hair from her face and satisfies himself that shes comfortable
then he puts his head out of the window
at the gate into paris soldiers are checking documents of occupants of carriages
valjean slips out of the carriage with cosette and makes his way along the wall away from the gate
valjean finds a section of tumble down wall and climbs over
valjean and cosette make their way down a darkened street
valjean and cosette turn down a narrow street no longer hurrying
the narrow street turns and opens out onto the river
there on the other side of the river in the light of a lamp stands javert
now valjean and cosette are running down narrow alleys into small dark courtyards not knowing which way to turn
whenever valjean thinks theyve thrown their pursuer there he is not far behind
and hes no longer alone
with him are a detachment of soldiers
javert and his team never seem to run
but hes always there
valjean and cosette turn into a street that is walled in by high windowless houses
they follow it round a corner to find a dead end
a high wall before them
valjean looks round
no way out
then he sees a nearby lamp bracket
hanging from it is the rope that is used to lower the oil lamp for lighting
he tears off the rope and ties one end round cosette beneath her armpits
then holding the other end he scales the wall using the corner to brace himself as he rises
once on the top he hauls cosette up by the rope
only then does he turn to look down onto the other side
a building in the middle windows glowing
grave stones black against the white snow
the sound of womens voices singing a psalm
te lucis ante terminum rerum creator poscimus ut pro tua clementia sis praesul et custodia
valjean lowers cosette down into the garden and drops down after her
javert and his men enter the dead end to find them gone
valjean crouched low with cosette in his arms holding her still and quiet until javert is gone
then he straightens up and looks round
he takes in the sound of singing
procul recedant somnia et noctium phantasmata more
nuns contd hostemque nostrum comprime ne polluantur corpora
he goes closer to the windows of the building
through the blurry glass he can make out a chapel and a line of nuns singing
valjean continues and sees a man filling in a new grave
the man starts as he sees valjean
valjean jumps takes cosette protectively into his arms
turns to answer
why its monsieur mayor
its fauchelevent now a gardener still limping from his injury
who are you
dont you remember
the cart fell on me
you saved my life
you got me this job as a gardener
valjean gazes at him and remembers
now you can do the same for me
we need a place of sanctuary
this child and i we need to disappear
in this place of holy orders you are brought to gods domain may the sisters grant you shelter may their prayers ease your pain
valjean and cosette follow him to the convent
well give thanks for what is granted what the sisters may ordain here we pray for new beginnings here our lives can start again
valjean looks to the heavens
the camera soars into the air and heads east as dawn breaks over paris
we rush low over paris as the sun comes up towards the place de la bastille
nine years later the dawn light glows on a massive elephant
the monument made of wood and plaster now ruined and crumbling stands on a plinth on one side of the wide open square
on the far side the remains of the great fortress that was the bastille
in the middle scaffolding surrounds a half built triumphal column which is being erected to celebrate the new regime
the streets that run from the square lead in one direction to the paris of power and wealth in the other direction into the slums
the camera sweeps in and down to meet the elephant
a head pops out of one of the elephants many holes gavroche a street urchin
he gives a shrill whistle
at once a dozen more street urchins show themselves from every crack in the monuments skin
agile as a monkey gavroche drops to the ground followed by his band
follow gavroche in as he races down a grand boulevard dodging the crowds of strolling bourgeoisie and beggars weaving in and out of the lines of carriages attempting to make
their way in either direction
these are the conveyances of the rich fine gilded coaches with matched horses and footmen on the back
virtually at a standstill they lend gavroche a platform as he leaps from coach to coach a street urchin dancing on the heads of the elite
as he goes the poor on the pavements sing to the stony faced rich in their golden high sprung glory look down and see the beggars at your feet
look down and show some mercy if you can
look down and see the sweepings of the street
beggars chorus contd look down look down upon your fellow man
the fine ladies and grand gentlemen in the carriages avert their eyes or raise the blinds of their carriage windows to shut out the sight of the losers of their
gavroche bounding over their heads evading the swipes of liveried footmen lands on the running board of one particularly grand carriage and begs taunts the rich ow do you do
my names gavroche
these are my people heres my patch
not much to look at nothing posh
nothing that youd call up to scratch
this is my school my high society
here in the slums of st michel
we live on crumbs of humble piety tough on the teeth but what the hell
think youre poor
think youre free
look down and show some mercy if you can
look down look down upon your fellow man
still running with gavroche as he hops onto the back of another very grand carriage the traffic now moving at last hitching a ride on the back one or two
of his gang hop on back of carriage with him the others run panting after to hear his political lecture
there was a time we killed the king we tried to change the world too fast
now we have got another king he is no better than the last
this is the land that fought for liberty now when we fight we fight for bread
here is the thing about equality everyones equal when theyre dead
take your place
gavroche contd take your chance
vive la france
vive la france
the carriage has reached an arch into a courtyard where a crowd of a couple of hundred is gathered outside a house of sickness
the carriage stops as its occupant wants to watch what is going on
the street is padded with straw
many eyes gaze up at the draped windows
people cross themselves
a priest is seen hurrying into the house accompanied by two altar boys
gavroche jumps off as the carriage stops and joins the crowd
the crowd is made up of citizens of paris student revolutionaries the poor and beggars
the students hand out printed leaflets and try to excite the crowd
look down and show some mercy if you can
look down look down upon your fellow man
whens it gonna end
when we gonna live
somethings gotta happen now
somethings gotta give
itll come itll come itll come
itll come itll come itll come
a student enjolras stands on a raised step making an impassioned speech with fellow student marius
the occupant of the stopped carriage is monsieur gillenormand marius grandfather
he is clearly deeply unhappy to see his grandson engaged in such an activity
in the crowd a young street girl eponine has her eyes fixed longingly on the handsome marius
where are the leaders of the land
where are the swells who run this show
only one man general lamarque speaks for the people here below
marius looks towards lamarques house behind him
lamarque is ill and fading fast wont last a week out so they say
with all the anger in the land how long before the judgement day
before we cut the fat ones down to size
before the barricades arise
mounted police ride in to break up the crowd
look down look down dont look us in the eye
look down look down stay here and you die
the crowd breaks up
the students shout to the crowd tomorrow we will return
tell everyone you know we will show them
lamarque is the only leader on our side
we have a right to pray for lamarque
we need more people then the police will not dare ride against us
vive le general lamarque
marius turns to see his grandfather staring him down furious
do you have any idea of the shame you bring on your family
youre behaving like a child
gillenormand spies a gun poking out of his jacket
gillenormand turns to get back in his carriage
through a crack in a door we see marius sitting on a tatty mattress in a tiny hovel of a room
he is taking out a hunting rifle from under the mattress wrapped in a rag
his eye is caught by the ring on his finger
close on a signet ring a family crest
marius stares at the ring then takes it off his finger
we reveal eponine staring at him through the door
hey there monsieur whats new with you
havent seen much of you of late
planning no doubt to change the world
plotting to overthrow the state
still living here in this old sewer might as well doss down in a ditch you still pretending to be poor everyone knows your grandpas rich marius rushes down the
stairs of the slum eponine following
we see glimpses of misery off the stairwell
how did you
theres lots of things i know wont take a franc that ive not earned all of those bridges have been burned
i like the way you talk monsieur
i like the way you always tease
eponine comes to a stop looking wistfully after marius
little he knows little he sees
marius is stopped as he exits the front door of the gorbeau tenement by a passing carriage
once it passes marius sees two people in the street outside
one is an old gentleman valjean
the other is a beautiful young girl cosette
the two are giving alms to beggars as they walk back from evening church service
marius cant take his eyes off cosette
hes never seen anyone so lovely in his life
we hear the instrumental foreshadowing of a heart full of love
as if drawn by mariuss gaze cosette looks up and meets his eyes
she too is amazed hes looking at her as if he already knows her
a second carriage breaks their held gaze
marius continues on down the street and when he looks back at that precise moment cosette looks at him again
valjean instinctively puts his arm round her guarding her jealously from this distant boys gaze
we cut further down the street to an alleyway where the thenardiers heavily disguised are waiting for valjeans approach with their gang of crooks babet brujon clacquesous montparnasse
everyone here you know your place brujon babet clacquesous you montparnasse watch for the law with eponine take care
montparnasse hurries over to the doorway where eponine was watching marius you turn on the tears
to madame thenardier who is holding a baby no mistakes my dears
thenardier approaches valjean and lures him into the mouth of the alleyway where madame thenardier is sat on the ground holding the crying infant
cosette is a few steps behind still entranced by the sight of marius
please msieur come this way
heres a child that aint eaten today
save a life spare a sou
god rewards all the good that you do
as valjean bends down to look at madame thenardier she recognizes him
wait a bit
know that face
to monsieur thenardier aint the world a remarkable place
men like me dont forget youre the bastard who borrowed cosette
what is this
are you mad
no monsieur you dont know what you say
thenardier pulls off his disguise
valjean recognises him
you know me
i know you
and youll pay what im due
he signals to his gang
a door opens in the alleyway revealing the huge brujon
the gang move in on valjean menacingly
shouts from up the street its the police
run for it
the gang spill out into the street to find themselves confronted by javert now with his men
marius watches as does gavroche drawn by the rumpus
another brawl in the square
another stink in the air
was there a witness to this
well let him speak to javert
he sees man with his arm protectively round a girl but does not recognize valjean as valjean has averted his face
monsieur these streets are not safe
but let these vermin beware well see that justice is done
he turns back on the thenardier gang in the passage
look upon this fine collection crawled from underneath a stone
this swarm of worms and maggots could have picked you to the bone
i know this man over here i know his name and his trade
and on your witness msieur ill see him suitably paid
he turns back to find valjean and cosette gone
but wheres the gentlemen gone
and why on earth did he run
you will have a job to find him
hes not all he seems to be and that girl he trails behind him shes the child he stole from me
marius equally baffled goes off in search of them
could it be hes that old jailbird that the tide now washes in
heard my name and started running
all the omens point to him
thenardier listening hears this all with great interest
so valjean is a crook like him
and the girl who stood beside him when i turned they both had gone
could he be the man ive hunted
could it be hes jean valjean
in the absence of a victim dear inspector may i go
and remember when youve nicked him it was me what told you so
to himself let the old man keep on running i will run him off his feet
to the crowd everyone about your business
to gavroche clear this garbage off the street
gavroche is sitting on a horse trough and falls back into it when javert surprises him
he is furious
he sings to javerts departing back and to marius who is close by
that inspector thinks hes something but its me who runs this town
and my theatre never closes and the curtains never down
have no fear
you can always find me here
now i remember
how can it be
we were children together
look whats become of me
she turns back to find marius gazing down the street
who was that girl
that bourgeois two a penny thing
eponine find her for me
what will you give me
got you all excited now but god knows what you see in her
arent you all delighted now
no i dont want your money sir
eponine do this for me discover where she lives
but careful how you go dont let your father know
im lost until shes found
i told you so
theres lots of things i know
eponine she knows her way around
wide of the police headquarters on the isle de la cite a huge bureaucracy
the camera finds javert standing inside looking out of a door leading onto the roof
as he sings he walks out onto the roof and stands by the symbol of the hq a monumental stone eagle
he looks down at the lights reflected in the river below
then up at the great city
javert too has a god and this is his prayer
there out in the darkness a fugitive running running from god fallen from grace god be my witness i never shall yield till we come face to face till we
come face to face
he knows his way in the dark mine is the way of the lord those who follow the path of the righteous shall have their reward and if they fall
as lucifer fell the flame
stars in your multitudes
scarce to be counted filling the darkness with order and light you are the sentinels silent and sure keeping watch in the night keeping watch in the night
you know your place in the sky you hold your course more
javert contd and your aim and each in your season returns and returns and is always the same and if you fall as lucifer fell you fall in flame
and so it must be and so it is written on the doorway to paradise that those who falter and those who fall must pay the price
lord let me find him that i may see him safe behind bars
i will never rest till then
this i swear this i swear by the stars
javert stands silhouetted against the stars his arms raised up to the night sky
marius comes down the street his mind full of thoughts of cosette
marius arrives at the first floor front room
here a group of students are cleaning rifles and sharing their excitement at the coming revolution enjolras combeferre courfeyrac joly grantaire feuilly prouvaire and others
do we have all the guns
our time is running short
students workers everyone
theres a river on the run
like the flowing of the tide paris is coming to our side
at notre dame the sections are prepared
at rue du bac theyre straining at the leash
grantaire put the bottle down
did we get the guns we need
give me brandy on my breath and ill breathe them all to death
the time is near
so near its stirring the blood in their veins
and yet beware
dont let the wine go to your brains
for the army we fight is a dangerous foe with the men and the arms that we never can match
it is easy to sit here and swat them like flies but the national guard will be harder to catch
we need a sign to rally the people to call them to arms to bring them in line
joly turns goes over to marius at the back a faraway look on his face
marius wake up
whats wrong today
you look as if youve seen a ghost
some wine and say whats going on
a ghost you say
a ghost maybe
she was like a ghost to me one minute there then she was gone
i am agog
i am aghast
is marius in love at last
ive never heard him ooh and aah
you talk of battles to be won more
grantaire contd and here he comes like don juan
it is better than an opera
they burst into laughter
but enjolras isnt smiling
it is time for us all to decide who we are
do we fight for the right to a night at the opera now
have you asked yourselves whats the price you might pay
is this simply a game for rich young boys to play
the colours of the world are changing day by day red the blood of angry men
black the dark of ages past
red a world about to dawn
black the night that ends at last
had you seen her today you might know how it feels to be struck to the bone by a moment of breathless delight
had you been there today you might also have known how the world may be changed in just one burst of light and what was right seems wrong and what
was wrong seems right
i feel my soul on fire
my world if shes not there
the colour of desire
the colour of despair
marius youre no longer a child i do not doubt you mean it well but now there is a higher call
who cares about your lonely soul
we strive towards a larger goal our little lives dont count at all
the blood of angry men
the dark of ages past
red a world about to dawn
black the night that ends at last
a scuffle at the door gavroche struggling with the barman
courfeyrac lets him through
listen to me
general lamarque is dead
enjolras turns to his companions
lamarque is dead
his death is the hour of fate
the peoples man
his death is the sign we await
on his funeral day they will honour his name with the light of rebellion ablaze in their eyes
from their candles of grief we will kindle our flame
on the tomb of lamarque shall our barricades rise
the time is here
enjolras contd let us welcome it gladly with courage and cheer
let us take to the street with no doubt in our hearts but a jubilant shout
they will come one and all
they will come when we call
as the students sing eponine enters wanting to talk to marius
marius sees her
cosette is pacing in her bedroom
its a pretty room the best room in this small summer house
her shutters are open giving a view of a wild unkempt garden
she looks at herself in a mirror aware of her looks perhaps for the first time
how strange this feeling that my lifes begun at last
this change can people really fall in love so fast
whats the matter with you cosette
have you been too much on your own
so many things unclear so many things unknown
in my life there are so many questions and answers that somehow seem wrong
in my life there are times when i catch in the silence the sigh of a faraway song and it sings of a world that i long to see out
of reach just a whisper away waiting for me
does he know im alive
do i know if hes real
cosette contd does he see what i see
does he feel what i feel
in my life im no longer alone now the love in my life is so near
find me now
find me here
valjean knocks and opens her door
he closes her shutters
dear cosette youre such a lonely child
how pensive how sad you seem to me
believe me were it within my power id fill each passing hour
how quiet it must be i can see with only me for company
theres so little i know that im longing to know of the man that you were in a time long ago
theres so little you say of the life you have known why you keep to yourself why were always alone
so dark and deep the secrets that you keep
in my life please forgive what i say you are loving and gentle and good
but papa dear papa in your eyes i am still like that child who was lost in a wood
no more words no more words
its a time that is dead
there are words that are better unheard better unsaid
in my life im no longer a child and i yearn for the truth that you know of the years
valjean leaves and goes into his own bedroom
a simple wooden shack at the back of the summerhouse valjean himself lives with spartan simplicity he has given the best room to cosette
valjean sits on his bed his back to cosette
you will learn
truth is given by god to us all in our time in our turn
marius rushes down the street eponine following
at the far end is the walled garden behind which lies valjeans house
in my life she has burst like the music of angels the light of the sun
and my life seems to stop as if something is over and something has scarcely begun
eponine youre the friend who has brought me here
thanks to you i am one with the gods and heaven is near
and i soar through a world that is new that is free
every word that he says is a dagger in me
in my life theres been no one like him anywhere anywhere where he is if he asked
id be his
in my life there is someone who touches my life sees cosette in the garden waiting near
a heart full of love
cosette sees marius
she comes up the garden path towards him
she sees eponine by mariuss side
a heart full of song
im doing everything all wrong oh god for shame i do not even know your name
dear madmoiselle wont you say
will you tell
cosette holds the wrought ironwork of the gate with both hands eyes on marius
eponine looks on and suffers
marius wraps his hands round cosettes
a heart full of love
no fear no regret
my name is marius pontmercy
and mines cosette
i dont know what to say then make no sound
i am lost i am found
a heart full of light a night bright as day and you must never go away cosette cosette
this is a chain well never break
do i dream
a heart full of love he was never mine to lose why regret what could not be
a heart full of you these are words hell never say not to me not to me not for me
a single look and then i knew
i knew it too
his heart full of love
from today he will never feel this way
for it isnt a dream not a dream after all
valjean comes to the door
cosette turns and runs in to the house
valjean walks down the overgrown garden path to the gate
marius moves quickly away instinctively nervous of discovery and hides behind the wall
valjean peers into the shadows
he senses that perhaps cosette has been talking to someone
he looks pensive
valjean returns inside
cosette has dropped a keepsake through the gate
marius picks it up
marius makes his way back down the street filled with thoughts of his love
completely forgetting eponine is there
shadows move up the street from the other direction
its thenardier and his gang
they gather at the wrought iron gate
this is his lair
ive seen the old fox around
he keeps himself to himself hes staying close to the ground
i smell profit here
ten years ago he came and paid for cosette
i let her go for a song
its time we settled the debt
thisll cost him dear
what do i care who you should rob
gimme my share
finish the job
you shut your mouth
youll get whats yours
brujon starts working on the gate lock
he finds eponine lurking in the shadows
what have we here
who is this hussy
its your brat eponine
dont you know your own kid
whys she hanging about here
eponine get on home
youre not needed in this
were enough here without you
i know this house i tell you
theres nothing here for you
just the old man and the girl
they live ordinary lives
youve got some gall
take care young miss youve got a lot to say
shes going soft
happens to all
go home eponine
go home youre in the way
they huddle round the garden gate which is now broken open
im gonna scream
im gonna warn them here
one little scream and youll regret it for a year
he goes to the gate and opens it
valjean now in his own bedroom hears the scream and turns to the window
thenardier and his gang shrink into the shadows as eponines scream ends at last
make for the sewers
leave her to me dont wait around
he turns on eponine and slaps her hard across the face
you wait my girl
youll rue this night
ill make you scream
youll scream all right
his men have levered up a grating and now thenardier and the gang disappear down into the sewers
valjean comes running into cosettes room
valjean takes her in his arms
my god cosette
i heard a cry in the dark
i heard the shout of angry voices in the street
three men i saw beyond the wall
three men in shadow moving fast
this is a warning to us all
these are the shadows of the past
he moves away to his own bedroom
must be javert
hes found my cover at last
ive got to get cosette away before he returns
he comes back to cosette
we must get away from shadows that will never let us be
tonight we leave cosette
rue de lhomme armee
and then a ship across the sea
prepare to leave and say no more
tonight well away
we cant go
its time to close another door and live another day
valjean leaves to start packing
feverishly cosette scribbles a letter
cosette hurries down the garden to the gate and goes to put the folded letter in the grill where her and marius hands entwined
then she sees eponine
eponine steps forward
she thrusts her letter into her hand
please give this to marius
he must know where to find me
she runs back inside
eponine crumples up the letter
she walks sadly away down the street
rain is just starting to fall
and now im all alone again nowhere to turn no one to go to
without a home without a friend more
eponine contd without a face to say hello to
the city goes to bed and i can live inside my head
on my own pretending hes beside me all alone i walk with him till morning without him i feel his arms around me and when i lose my way i
close my eyes and he has found me
she crosses a bridge over the river
in the rain the pavement shines like silver all the lights are misty in the river in the darkness the trees are full of starlight and all i see is
him and me forever and forever
and i know its only in my mind that im talking to myself and not to him
and although i know that he is blind still i say theres a way for us
i love him but when the night is over he is gone the rivers just a river
without him the world around me changes the trees are bare and everywhere the streets are full of strangers
i love him but every day im learning all my life ive only been pretending
without me his world will go on turning a world thats full of happiness that i have never know
i love him i love him i love him but only on my own
her solitary journey has brought her to the gorbeau slum
she goes inside
eponine stands outside marius door
she opens the letter reads it then hides it in her pocket
she pushes open marius door
marius looks up
i came to tell you shes gone
what do you mean
shes gone to england
marius sets off at a run towards the rue plumet
marius finds the gate broken open sees the house beyond dark and deserted
he pushes in to the garden up to the house windows sees the rooms empty within
he stands staring in shock
eponine has followed him and watches him in silence
valjean and cosette sit on either side of the carriage apart staring out of their respective windows
a stark contrast to the carriage scene when valjean sang to cosette as a little girl
one day more
another day another destiny
this never ending road to calvary
these men who seem to know my crime will surely come a second time one day more
marius by the empty house
i did not live until today how can i live when we are parted
one day more
tomorrow youll be worlds away and yet with you my world has started
intercut between eponine at the gate cosette and valjean in the carriage and marius in the dark garden
one more day all on my own
will we ever meet again
one more day with him not caring
i was born to be with you
what a life i might have known
and i swear i will be true
but he never saw me there
enjolras and the students have a production line under way for making bullets
the rifles are now stacked and ready for the uprising
grantaire is downstairs flirting with a barmaid
madame hucheloup the proprietress of the cafe musain is sewing a red revolutionary flag to help the students
one more day before the storm
intercut with marius walking back sadly through the rue de la chanvrerie
eponine follows him at a distance
do i follow where she goes
at the barricades of freedom
shall i join my brothers there
when our ranks begin to form do i stay and do i dare
from top of stairs for grantaires benefit will you take your place with me
grantaire rather reluctantly goes upstairs
the time is now
the day is here
one day more
javert is briefing a hundred uniformed police about the coming day in a grand ornate old room at police headquarters
one day more to revolution
we will nip it in the bud
well be ready for these schoolboys
they will wet themselves with blood
one day more
monsieur and madame thenardier are in the ground floor bar slyly watching a student smuggling some rifles up the stairs disguised in a piece of cloth
joly takes a tray and collects empty tankards
as he ascends the stairs madame hucheloup tries to get him to give the tankards back
watchem run amuck
catchem as they fall
never know your luck when theres a free for all
here a little dip there a little touch most of them are goners so they wont miss much
the drinkers in the bar raise their glasses to the students with their rifles
the students appeal to them
grantaire is drunk already
joly starts to melt the tankards in a pot to make more bullets
marius enters the ground floor and takes the red flag from madame hucheloup that she has just finished
the citizens on the ground floor join the students
one day to a new beginning
raise the flag of freedom high
every man will be a king
every man will be a king
theres a new world for the winning
theres a new world to be won
do you hear the people sing
marius enters the first floor to join them at last
my place is here
i fight with you
valjean and cosette arrive at their new hideout marius ties the red flag onto a flagpole one day more
i did not live until today how can i live when we are parted
eponine outside the cafe gazing longingly towards marius one more day on my own
javert in the police station to his men i will join these peoples heroes i will follow where they go
i will learn their little secrets i will know the things they know
one day more
tomorrow youll be worlds away and yet with you my world has started
one more day to revolution we will nip it in the bud well be ready for these schoolboys watchem run amuck catchem as they fall never know your luck when
theres a free for all
tomorrow well be far away
tomorrow is the judgement day
tomorrow well discover what our god in heaven has in store one more dawn
one more day
one day more
we pull back from enjolras and marius holding their flag at the first floor window with the students beyond them to see that citizens have spilled out of the cafe
musain into the street and have all joined in the final chorus
all is still
then comes the soft beating of draped drums
the tramp of feet
all down the streets waiting the silent faces of the poor
among them we see enjolras marius and the radical students
police and national guardsmen control the growing crowds
now into view come the leaders of a great funeral procession
an entire battalion of infantry marching with weapons reversed
a column of black suited dignitaries carrying branches of laurel
a division of cavalry rides in front behind a section of military drummers who drum a military tatoo
into frame comes a team of black horses stepping slowly black plumes nodding drawing behind them a gun carriage draped in the tricolour flag
on the carriage stands a softly in time with the drums the watching people begin to sing
do you hear the people sing singing the song of angry men
it is the music of a people who will not be slaves again
the police and guardsmen look round to see who is singing so subversively but they cant be sure where its coming from
the singing grows stronger
when the beating of your heart echoes the beating of the drums there is a life about to start when tomorrow comes
the dignitaries become aware of the singing and glance uneasily from side to side
will you join in our crusade
who will be strong and stand with me
beyond the barricade is there a world you long to see
as the coffin on its carriage draws level with the students enjolras suddenly steps out in front of the horses drawing the carriage and waves the red flag stopping the
horses and the procession
then join in the fight that will give you the right to be free
the students break the ranks of the crowd and surround the coffin carriage
do you hear the people sing singing the song of angry men
it is the music of a people who will not be slaves again
when the beating of your heart echoes the beating of the drums there is a life about to start when tomorrow comes
enjolras marius and courfeyrac and other students climb onto the top of the carriage as the horses and led by combeferre
will you give all you can give so that our banner may advance
some will fall and some will live will you stand up and take your chance
the blood of the martyrs will water the meadows of france
the crowd supports them and surround the coffin carriage blocking the attempts of the police to intervene singing with passion
do you hear the people sing singing the song of angry men
it is the music of a people who will not be slaves again
when the beating of your heart echoes the beating of the drums there is a life about to start when tomorrow comes
enjolras the students and the impassioned crowd have now become the procession
they turn off the main street away from the expected course of the funeral procession
gavroches elephant looms over this side street
gavroche and his gang jump down from the elephant to join in
as the procession turns off the calvary division gallop ahead and disappear round a corner
will you join in our crusade
who will be strong and stand with me
somewhere beyond the barricade is there a world you long to see
do you hear the people sing
students crowd contd say do you hear the distant drums
it is the future that we bring when tomorrow comes
the students and crowd come face to face with the calvary
on one side muskets of the infantry poke through the broken down fence surrounding the elephant
other infantry have taken up position in a cafe opposite upending tables to provide cover
there is a tense prolonged silence
then suddenly one nervous soldier lets off a round
it hits a middle aged kindly looking woman citizen in the crowd around the coffin carriage
the crowd is furious
students charge the soldier grab his musket and knock him down with the hilt of the gun
more shots ring out
the cavalry charges
the funeral explodes into a riot
the people of paris turn on the dragoons the national guards the police
more squadrons of dragoons charge into the crowd sabres unsheathed
women run screaming in terror
to the barricades
to the barricades
some students fire weapons into the air some into the cavalry and at the infantry
enjolras knocks a calvary officer off his horse and marius jumps on the horse
the students break away and race off through the cafe into a side street where citizens begin to erect a barricade
a cavalry rider gives chase and is shot by one of the students and falls through the window of an upended carriage
the students with marius on horseback race to the slums
follow the students as they burst into their home street
they have been joined by a motley collection of citizens including burghers and an old eccentric man father mabeuf who works as hard as anyone
they raid a fencing shop and a gun shop for weapons they force wives to give up their husbands muskets and chalk up the debt to the revolution on their
front doors they encourage homeowners to contribute furniture sometimes appearing at high windows to help overcome any reluctance
soon the street is raining tables chairs mattresses sofas
they smash streetlamps
they set to work to build their barricade
students commandeer an omnibus which is overturned to form the barricades heart
three students arrive in the street hauling an uprooted tree
they pull up paving stones rip boards timbers and front doors from house and shop fronts pull down buttresses and raid the cafe musain systematically stripping it of every item
of furniture despite the lamentations and protestations of madame hucheloup and her barmaid
as the barricade rises they bring down from the first floor of the cafe the rifles and ammunition theyve gathered to prepare to defend their chosen ground
a student stands on a stone post distributing weapons
they line the first and second floor front rooms with paving stones to create protected shooting positions
the inside of the barricade is built neatly with steps up made from paving stones
the outside is a crazy knarled mess
here upon these stones we will build our barricade
in the heart of the city we claim as our own each man to his duty and dont be afraid
a man in workers clothing is helping build the growing barricade
he wears the insignia of the rebels and keeps his head down
i will need a report on the strength of the foe
the man whos just arrived looks up
i can find out the truth
i know their ways fought their wars served my time in the days of my youth
he slips away through the barricade which is still rising
the people unite
pray your right dogs will bark
fleas will bite
they will do what is right
the barricade is now complete an impressive wall up to twelve feet high with one heavily guarded section that can be wheeled open to allow access
two smaller barricades protect the left and right side of the cafe
enjolras climbs halfway up the main barricade and turns to his little army
grantaire prises the final piece of madame hucheloups furniture from her arms her favourite sewing armchair and adds it to the barricade
as the men sing she steals it back defiantly
red the blood of angry men
black the dark of ages past
red a world about to dawn
black the night that ends at last
it is night
the students have been waiting for hours
a single flaming torch atop the barricade caged in by cobbles underlights a fluttering red flag
there is no sign yet of any opposition
a boy climbs down from sentry duty on the barricade
marius realizes its eponine
she sits down with her back to him
hey little boy whats this i see
god eponine the things you do
i know this is no place for me still i would rather be with you
get out before the trouble starts
get out ponine you might get shot
ive got you worried now i have
that shows you like me quite a lot
joly sentry on the main barricade sees a figure approach
javert still in his disguise as a rebel is let back through the guarded gate into the barricaded street
listen my friends i have done as i said
i have been to their lines i have counted each man
i will tell what i can
better be warned they have armies to spare and our danger is real we will need all our cunning to bring them to heel
if you know what their movements are well spoil their game
there are ways that a people can fight we shall overcome their power
i have overheard their plans
there will be no attack tonight
they intend to starve you out before they start a proper fight concentrate their force hit us when its light liar
they all look up
theres gavroche on the top of the barricade
good evening dear inspector
lovely evening my dear
i know this man my friends
his names inspector javert
so dont believe a word he says cause none of its true
this only goes to show what little people can do
guns swing round to aim at javert
he stares back in defiance
gavroche comes dancing down the barricade to courfeyracs delighted embrace
bravo little gavroche
youre the top of the class
gavroche grabs grantaires red cap and puts it on his own head mimicking the students
so what are we going to do with this snake in the grass
enjolras faces javert
tie this man and take him to the tavern in there
the people will decide your fate inspector javert
shoot me now or shoot me later every schoolboy to his sport
death to each and every traitor
i renounce your peoples court
take this man
bring him through
there is work we have to do
javert is led into the cafe
as they pass through the front door only one student is holding javert
seizing his opportunity javert breaks free and the students have to subdue him by force
javert is on his knees and is being tied to the staircase
when are they coming
suddenly out of the darkness the students and citizens at the barricade here an ominous distant sound
the sound of marching feet hundreds of men marching in unison
first soft then building louder and louder closer and closer
boots on cobbles
the sound comes right into the end of the street
enjolras and all the students man the main barricade
they peer over the barricade
in the pitch blackness all they can make out is hundreds of gossamer thin slivers
these are bayonets and musket barrels dimly lit by the reflection from the torch
a voice shouts out from the darkness
at the same time we hear the clatter of guns being levelled
a flash turns all the facades of the street bright crimson as though the door of a furnace has suddenly open and shut
a dreadful explosion bursts over the barricade
the red flag falls the pole sliced through
bullets richochet off the cornices of the houses bore into the barricade and wound several men
as students return fire comrades do not fire back
do not waste powder
in the darkness the clang of ramrods in muskets the troop reloading weapons
enjolras picks up the fallen flag and is about to take it up when the old man father mabeuf who has seen many insurrections before this takes the flag and
runs up onto the top of the barricade
vive la france
a second volley
father mabeuf falls down dead
while everyone is reacting to the dead old man and the wounded the men are distracted from noticing that some french soldiers have used the cover of darkness to creep
down the street
all at once the first full attack begins
shouts and the rattle of gunfire as soldiers throw themselves up and over the barricade
the students run for their guns and return fire
they are taken by surprise
all could be lost in the first instant
some soldiers make it up to the top of the barricade where theyre driven back by the fierce resistance of the defenders
eponine sees one soldier aiming his rifle at marius she throws herself in front of marius just as the rifle fires and marius is safe
they are being overrun
the gun battle is fierce
marius in a flash of inspiration realises all is lost unless they do something
he drags a barrel of gunpowder to the top of the barricade grabs the torch and with a face of deadly resolve he tips the torch towards the barrel
clear out or ill blow up the barricade
blow it up then and take yourself with it
and myself with it
marius brings the torch closer to the powder keg
but already the soldiers have cleared out
marius comes down from the barricade
to marius thank you
what were you thinking
as everyone surrounds marius in amazement he spots eponine lying propped against the barricade
what have you done
he kneels by her side
eponine is dying
its from cosette
i kept it from you
with a struggle she pulls the letter out of her pocket and pushes it into his hand
dont be too hard on me
marius is shocked to find blood pouring from her wound
eponine youre hurt
you need some help
rain begins to fall
dont you fret msieur marius i dont feel any pain
a little fall of rain can hardly hurt me now
youre here thats all i need to know and you will keep me safe and you will keep me close and rain will make the flowers grow
but you will live eponine dear god above
if i could close your wounds with words of love just hold me now and let it be
you will live a hundred years if i could show you how
i wont desert you now
the rain cant hurt me now
this rain will wash away whats past and you will keep me safe and you will keep me close ill sleep in your embrace at last
marius tries to comfort eponine in his arms
hush a bye dear eponine you wont feel any pain a little fall of rain can hardly hurt you now im here
so dont you fret msieur marius i dont feel any pain a little fall of rain can hardly hurt me now
i will stay with you till you are sleeping
thats all i need to know and you will keep me safe more
eponine contd and you will keep me close and rain
will make the flowers
eponine dies in mariuss arms
marius looks up at the others his eyes full of tears
they were the first to fall
the first to fall upon this barricade
her name was eponine
her life was cold and dark yet she was unafraid
we fight here in her name
she will not die in vain
she will not be betrayed
they pick up eponines body and carry her into the tavern
to gavroche are you alright
that was my sister
marius reads the letter eponine has given him
he takes out pencil and paper and writes a note
looking round he sees gavroche
do you know the rue de lhomme arme
course i do
will you take this for me
he holds out his note
the landlady climbs the stairs followed by gavroche
the landlady indicates the door and gavroche knocks boldly
the door opens a crack to reveal a cautious valjean
letter for cosette
ill take it
gavroche holds out the letter with one hand not quite giving it the other hand open for a tip
valjean gives him a coin which he pockets as he hands over the letter
something for you something for me
who needs charity
on valjean as he reads the note
dearest cosette you have entered my soul and soon you will be gone
can it be only a day since we met and the world was reborn
if i should fall in the battle to come let this be my goodbye
now that i know you love me as well it is harder to die
i pray that god will bring me home to be with you
pray for your marius
he prays for you
he looks up deeply distressed
he cant bear the thought of losing cosette
they havent got a chance these boys they almost certainly will die shell be alone and she will need me all the more and we will go on as before
when he is gone i dare not think like this i must find this boy
valjean walks the streets not caring where he goes struggling with his tormented thoughts
he sees a barricade being dismantled
suddenly he knows what hes going to do
he sees a dead soldier
he takes his jacket and swiftly pulls it on
he continues on his way in the dark
looking up he sees that hes been walking all the time towards the very barricade where marius waits
now looking like a soldier he passes unchallenged through their lines and into the shadows
as he passes he notices two soldiers climbing up onto the rooftops
glimpses through the barricade of a lone figure approaching from the far end of the narrow street
the figure comes into lamp light
its valjean in the soldiers jacket
the student sentries level their guns
gavroche jumps up
here comes a man in uniform
what brings you to this place
i come here as a volunteer
approach and show your face
you wear an army uniform
thats why they let me through
the student sentries open the slot in the barricade to let valjean enter
youve got some years behind you sir
theres much that i can do
you see that prisoner over there
he points to javert in a dark corner his hands tied
a volunteer like you
a spy who calls himself javert
hes going to get it too
javert looks up and meets valjeans eyes
a steady shared look
i know him
hes no soldier
suddenly valjean spots a couple of snipers creeping over the roofs to gain an angle of attack on them
they are aiming at enjolras
swiftly valjean grabs a gun and shoots up at them sending them scattering
quickly other students join in and the snipers are driven back
there is a burst of gunfire from both ends of the street as a brief fire fight ensues
the snipers have disappeared
enjolras turns to valjean
for your presence of mind for the deed you have done i will thank you msieur when our battle is won
thank you msieur
give me no thanks msieur
theres something you can do
if it is in my power
give me the spy javert
let me take care of him
javert hears this with grim satisfaction
the law is inside out
the world is upside down
do what you have to do the man belongs to you
he turns to his little army
the enemy may be regrouping
hold yourselves in readiness
come my friends back to your positions
the dawn is breaking fast
valjean takes javert out the back of the cafe musain
he carries a knife
we meet again
youve hungered for this all your life
take your revenge
how right you should kill with a knife
valjean uses the knife to cut javert free
you talk too much
your life is safe in my hands
get out of here
valjean take care
im warning you
clear out of here
once a thief forever a thief
what you want you always steal
you would trade your life for mine
yes valjean you want a deal
shoot me now for all i care if you let me go beware
youll still answer to javert
you are wrong and always have been wrong
im a man no worse than any man
you are free and there are no conditions no bargains or petitions
theres nothing that i blame you for
youve done your duty nothing more
no doubt our paths will cross again
he raises his gun and points it at javert
as javert goes he raises the gun barrel and fires a single shot into the air
courfeyrac you take the watch they may attack before its light
everybody keep the faith for certain as our banner flies we are not alone the people too must rise
marius is manically working to raise the height of one of the smaller barricades
grantaire drunkenly starts singing a drinking song and it is taken up more seriously by feuilly
bottles are passed round
drink with me to days gone by
sing with me the songs we knew
heres to pretty girls who went to our heads
heres to witty girls who went to our beds
heres to them marius sings to valjean and heres to you
drink with me to days gone by
can it be you fear to die
will the world remember you when you fall
can it be your death means nothing at all
is your life just one more lie
grantaire glares at enjolras and enters the cafe
drink with me to days gone by
to the life that used to be
at the shrine of friendship never say die
let the wine of friendship never run dry
heres to you and heres to me
valjean is moving through the cafe when he hears marius through a window
he moves to the window
marius sits beneath it
do i care if i should die now she goes across the sea
life without cosette means nothing at all
please dont weep cosette should marius fall
will you weep cosette for me
valjean listens to mariuss song and hes moved
look outs keep watch at either end of the barricaded street
many of the rest of the rebels are sleeping
valjean paces unable to sleep inside the cafe
dead bodies are lined up on the ground floor
he comes to a stop and gazes on marius as he sleeps through the window
god on high hear my prayer more
valjean contd in my need you have always been there
he is young hes afraid let him rest heaven blessed
bring him home bring him home bring him home
hes like the son i might have known if god had granted me a son
the summers die one by one how soon they fly on and on and i am old and will be gone
bring him peace bring him joy he is young he is only a boy
you can take you can give let him be let him live if i die let me die let him live bring him home bring him home bring him home
valjean is now kneeling next to the sleeping marius
crane up and up seeing the little world of the barricaded street now surrounded by waiting soldiers and the streets round them packed with soldiers in their thousands so many
that we know the little band can never win
crane up and up until the barricade and the army that entraps it has become a small pool of darkness in the centre of the bright lights of paris
the sun still below the rooftops
every house is tightly shuttered
grantaire is fast asleep in the upstairs room dead drunk
enjolras re enters the barricade through the secret gate
he has been on a reconnaissance
he looks at the street
no one is stirring but for a single shutter which opens a crack a face peeps and it closes again
below him the students are up and getting ready
the people have not stirred
yet we will not abandon those who still live in fear
the people have not heard yet we will not abandon those who cannot hear
let us not waste lives
let all who wish to go from here
there is silence
yet no one moves to go
from top of barricade do you hear the people sing singing the song of angry men joining it is the music of the people who will not be slaves again
when the beating of your heart echoes the beating of the drums there is a life about to start when tomorrow comes
under this enjolras
i will go into the streets
there are bodies all around
ammunition to be had
lots of bullets to be found
i cant let you go
let me go
hes no more than a boy
i am old
i have nothing to fear
gavroche is already climbing the barricade under cover of the smoke
come back gavroche
dont you dare
someone pull him down right now
look at me im almost there
little people know when little people fight we may look easy pickings but weve got some bite
so never kick a dog when hes just a pup well fight like twenty armies and we wont give up
the rays of the rising sun break through lighting up gavroche
so youd better run for cover when the pup grows crack
a musket shot
gavroche falls face down onto the barricade
he runs up the barricade seizes gavroches body in his arms convulsed with grief and brings it back through the gate in the barricade
at the other end of the street javert has appeared
he sees this gate
and talks to the army officer
as the smoke from the muskets clears horses are revealed drawing field artillery into position
the army officer is lining up the big guns carefully
you at the barricades listen to this
the people of paris sleep in their beds
you have no chance no chance at all
why throw your lives away
enjolras gazes on his pitifully small group
let us die facing our foes
make them bleed while we can
makeem pay through the nose
makeem pay for every man
let others rise to take our place until the earth is free
the sun now appears above the rooftops of the city
and the big guns fire boom
the bombardment hits the barricade rocking it
in its wake a massive barrage of musket fire
the big gun has been lined up with the gate and has burst right through in the first hit
bullets fly and every few moments another cannon ball smashes into the piled debris
javert is glimpsed among the attackers
enjolras and the students throw themselves onto the barricades firing at the attackers handing their rifles down to others to be re loaded firing again
valjean moves among them tending to the wounded lifting down the dead regardless of his own safety
marius takes a bullet and crumples and falls
valjean runs towards him crash
the latest cannonade bursts a hole in the barricade and now the soldiers are storming through
the hard core of student fighters retreat firing as they go into the cafe musain
students and soldiers fight in the cafe on the stairs up the stairs to the upper room
students driving back the pursuing soldiers hack away at the staircase smashing it to fragments the soldiers below fire up at them students fall their bodies caught on the jagged
remnants of the stairs
grantaire is still unconscious from drink
valjean has marius in his arms and is hiding him from the onrush of the soldiers the students ammunition has run out theyre hurling sticks and bottles but the soldiers
have found a way to clamber up shooting as they come and one by one the students are falling
valjean carries marius away from the carnage
a soldier challenges him
one violent blow from valjean sends the soldier flying the soldiers break through at last to the upper room to find theres only enjolras still alive
he stands by the window knowing he will die now proud and unafraid
seeing him the soldiers hesitate
the sudden silence wakes grantaire from his drunken slumber
long live the republic
he sees enjolras with the muskets raised against him
grantaire goes and joins him
enjolras smiles and raises his now ragged red flag
the rifles blaze
grantaire drops back to the ground
enjolras falls back enjolras falling backwards out of the window until he hangs upside down the red flag still in his hands streaming like blood down the wall
pull back to see the street littered with corpses and the remains of the barricade and soldiers scouring the rubble for any last pockets of resistance
back and back to come to a stop looking at the wide scene
into frame walks javert grimly surveying the victory of law over rebellion
valjean carries marius down a long narrow alley that runs between the backs of tall houses
the alley turns a corner and there ahead is a dead end
behind him the stamp of soldiers boots
ahead no way out
then his searching gaze falls on an iron grating in the ground
a storm drain
on the soldiers as they come round the corner into the end of the alley
they look round
the soldiers depart
a moment of silence
then into the alleys end steps javert
not so easily fooled
he walks all the way to the end and looks round
he sees the drain at his feet
he sees the signs that the grating has been lifted
he stoops and tries to lift it
its far too heavy for him
he straightens up and looks round calculating
where does the drain lead
valjean is pulling marius after him down a tight sloping pipe where dark water races
suddenly they start to slide then drop through a vent into a wide sewage tunnel
faint light reflecting off the slime of curving tunnel walls
the skitter of rats
sodden forms floating by dead bodies
valjean carries marius down the tunnel moving as fast as he can losing strength all the time
he reaches an intersection where four sewers meet
light falls through distant gratings
one of the four sewers is dry
here he lets his burden down and himself sinks to the slimy ground to rest
he lets his eyes close
a voice echoes in the shadows
heres a hint of gold stuck into a tooth pardon me msieur you wont be needing it no more
shouldnt be too hard to sell
a figure coming closer
a sewer thief robbing corpses
no sign of life in either valjean or marius
well someones got to cleanem up my friends before the little harvest disappears into the mud
someones got to collect their odds and ends when the gutters run with blood
now we see the thief is thenardier
he finds a ring on mariuss finger and pulls it off
heres a tasty ring pretty little thing hearts no longer going and hes lived his little time but his watch is ticking yet
its a world where the dog eats the dog
where they kill for the bones in the street
and god in his heaven he dont interfere cos hes dead as the stiff at my feet
i raise my eyes to see the heavens and only the moon looks down
the harvest moon shines down
valjean wakes rears up seizes thenardier by the arm slams him against the sewer wall
how do i get out of here
valjean drops him picks marius up once more and sets off
thenardier stares after them grinning
hes sent then the wrong way
later valjean in the sewers marius on his back and theyre sinking ever deeper into the slimy water
as he feels himself sink valjean holds marius up in his arms and forges on chest deep lifting the younger man above his head
still he sinks until his face is half submerged and hes gagging in the filth
he stumbles and suddenly hes sunk beneath the surface and marius is dropping then up he bursts again face black with slime eyes burning with his refusal to be beaten
later valjean staggers down the endless sewers marius on his back
but all the time he can hear closer now the rushing sound of the river
round a bend and at last moonlight ahead
he drags himself on through the shallow running water towards the moonlight
he reaches the exit at last
before him the river
valjean crusted with slime heaves marius out of the sewer onto the embankment that runs beside the river
he looks up
there staring at him is javert
valjean rises slowly
heaves marius up onto his back once more
the strain of the night is showing
hes a man near the end of his strength
its you javert
i knew you wouldnt wait too long
the faithful servant at his post once more
this mans done no wrong
and he needs his familys care
i warned you i would not give in
i wont be swayed
another hour yet and then im yours and all our debts are paid
the man of mercy comes again and talks of justice
come time is running short look down javert
hes standing in his grave
he starts to move past javert
javert draws his pistol and holds it to valjeans head
one more step and you die
valjean meets his eyes
that old battle of will against will
then i die
he starts walking past javert
javerts hand trembles as it holds the pistol
valjean keeps walking
javert wills himself to shoot but he just cant do it
frustrated enraged with himself he lowers the gun
take him valjean before i change my mind
i will be waiting
he turns away trembling now all up and down his body
he stares into the river
valjean is gone now
who is this man
what sort of devil is he
to have caught me in a trap and choose to let me go free
it was his hour at last to put a seal on my fate wipe out the past and wash me clean off the slate
all it would take was a flick of his knife vengeance was his and he gave me back my life
he begins to move away along the embankment up steps towards a bridge
hes unaware of everything except the turmoil in his brain
damned if i live in the debt of a thief
damned if i yield at the end of the chase
javert contd i am the law and the law is not mocked
ill spit his pity right back in his face
there is nothing on earth that we share
it is either valjean or javert
how can i allow this man to hold dominion over me
this desperate man that i have hunted
he gave me my life
he gave me freedom
i should have perished by his hand it was his right
it was my right to die as well
instead i live
but live in hell
he moves up from the embankment onto the bridge
here he stands looking down at the dark water of the night river
the seine forms a whirlpool here where violent currents swirl round the piles of the bridge
and my thoughts fly apart can this man be believed
shall his sins be forgiven
shall his crimes be reprieved
and must i now begin to doubt who never doubted all those years
my heart is stone and still it trembles
the world i have known is lost in shadow is he from heaven or from hell
and does he know that granting me my life today this man has killed me even so
he climbs up onto the parapet reaching his arms up to the night sky
i am reaching but i fall and the stars are black and cold as i stare into the void of a world that cannot hold
ill escape now from that world from the world of jean valjean this is nowhere i can turn
there is no way to go on
he reaches higher turning his body twisting as if he wants some angel from on high to save him and so turning he falls into the river
the swirling eddies close over him
and hes lost
soldiers are dismantling the last of the barricade
women move about the street seeking their dead loved ones among the bodies that still litter the barricade
these are both the middle class mothers of the students enjolrass mother grantaires sister and the working women of the slums for whom they died united now in their grief
did you see them going off to fight
children of the barricade who didnt last the night
did you see them lying where they died
someone used to cradle them and kiss them when they cried
did you see them lying side by side
who will wake them
no one ever will
no one ever told them that a summer day can kill
they were schoolboys never held a gun fighting for a new world that would rise up like the sun
wheres that new world now the fightings done
the women move off to go about their days business
close on marius hes waking from the nightmare finding himself in a fine bed with clean linen
he looks round a handsome room
youve come back to us
marius recognises the old man anxiously watching him his grandfather monsieur gillenormand
he struggles to rise but he lacks the strength
his grandfathers face shows only love and concern
no more harsh words between us
i just thank god youre alive
timidly the old man comes closer to the bed
tears form in mariuss eyes
encouraged the old man takes mariuss hand in his
youve come home
to all of us
the distant voices of the mourning women round and round and back where you began
marius makes his way slowly up the stairs to the upper room
hes still weak from his wounds
he enters the room where his friends died and looks round
he sinks into a chair
theres a grief that cant be spoken theres a pain goes on and on empty chairs at empty tables now my friends are dead and gone
he sees the bloodstain on the wall beneath the window sill
the blood of enjolras
here they talked of revolution here it was they lit the flame here they sang about tomorrow more
marius contd and tomorrow never came
from the table in the corner they could see a world reborn and they rose with voices ringing and i can hear them now
the very words that they had sung became their last communion on the lonely barricade at dawn
he looks out of the window at whats left of the barricade
he seems to see again the brave doomed defence the smoke and the gunfire the young men falling
oh my friends my friends forgive me that i live and you are gone theres a grief that cant be spoken theres a pain goes on and on
phantom faces at the window phantom shadows on the floor empty chairs at empty tables where my friends will meet no more
oh my friends my friends dont ask me what your sacrifice was for empty chairs at empty tables where my friends will sing no more
slowly he rises from the chair and turns to the doorway
there stands cosette waiting for him
cosette holds marius supporting him as he enters the house
every day you walk with stronger step you walk with longer step
the worst is over
every day i wonder every day who it was brought me here from the barricade
cosette leads him into the room where valjean and gillenormand wait
dont think about it marius
with all the years ahead of us
i will never go away and we will be together every day
every day well remember that night and the vow that we made
as valjean and gillenormand look on marius and cosette sing their love to each other
a heart full of love a night full of you the words are old but always true
she was never mine to keep she is youthful she is free
i saw you waiting and i knew thank god thank god you are here
thank god thank god you are home
waiting for you
at your feet
at your call
love is the garden of the young let it be let it be
a heart full of love this i give you this day
and it wasnt a dream not a dream after all
marius stands before valjean alone in this more private room
msieur this is a day i never can forget
is gratitude enough for giving me cosette
your home shall be with us and not a day shall pass but we will prove our love to you whom we shall call a father to us both a
father to us all
not another word my son
theres something now that must be done
hes prepared himself to make this confession but its still hard
there lived a man whose name was jean valjean
he stole some bread to save his sisters son for nineteen winters served his time in sweat he washed away his crime
marius hears this with shock
years ago he broke parole and lived a life apart
how could he tell cosette and break her heart
its for cosette this must be faced if he is caught she is disgraced
the time has come to journey on and from this day he must be gone
who am i
who am i
youre jean valjean
marius cant conceal that hes disturbed by this revelation
monsieur you cannot leave
whatever i tell my beloved cosette she will never believe me
make her believe i have gone on a journey a long way away
tell her my heart was too full for farewells it is better this way
promise me monsieur cosette will never know
i give my word
what i have spoken why i must go
for the sake of cosette it must be so
a waiting cab
valjean comes out of the modest lodging house and gets in
the cab rattles away down the street
in the cab valjean sits gazing far away at nothing
then his weary eyes close
cosette gazes at marius bewildered by what she has just learned
wheres he gone without a word that wouldnt be his way to go all he asked for me to say hes on a journey far away
dear cosette he loves you so perhaps he will return some day
cosette comes into mariuss arms tears in her eyes
he cant leave us now whats our wedding day without him giving me away
marius and cosette newly married are walking towards marius house through an aisle created by wedding guests
carriages line the street
ring out the bells upon this day of days
may all the angels of the lord above in jubilation sing their songs of praise
and crown this blessed time with peace and love
waltz music plays as marius and cosette lead the dancing at the wedding reception
as the dance proceeds two extraordinary figures enter and start helping themselves to the drink and the food
they are thenardier and his wife dressed up for high society
the baron and baroness du thenard they look round as the dance continues highly satisfied with themselves and see marius
thenardier makes a mock formal bow
i forget where we met
was it not at the chateau lafarge where the duke did that puke down the duchesss decolletage
no baron du thenard the circles i move in are humbler by far
go away thenardier
do you think i dont know who you are
hes not fooled
told you so
show msieur what youve come here to show
tell the boy what you know
pity to disturb you at a feast like this but francs surely wouldnt come amiss
in gods name say what you have to say
to thenardier he speaks
to marius you pay
what i saw clear as light jean valjean in the sewers that night had this corpse on his back some boy hed killed in a viscious attack
i was there never fear
even found me this fine souvenir
he shows off his ring
marius stares in astonishment
i know this
this was mine
this is surely some heavenly sign
thenardier steals the ring back
and theres more
mark this well it was the night that the barricades fell
then its true
then im right
jean valjean was my saviour that night
thenardier looks past marius to where cosette stands among their friends
he lowers his voice
jean valjean the old con
you pay up and ill say where hes gone
he takes out money and reluctantly presses it into thenardiers hands
madame thenardier takes the money before thenardier has safely pocketed it
not so loud
heres for you
god forgive us the things that we do
hows about some extra on a day so glad our little orphan girl she hasnt done so bad
raised in a convent cash to spare we want our share
marius hands over yet more money to madame thenardier
quite the little nun aint she
thenardier sinks to the ground felled by a powerful blow from an angered marius
the band stops playing
where is he
cowardly voice the convent
marius rushes to cosette and we see him telling her where valjean is
they hurry away
thenardier clambers to his feet helped by his wife
he gestures to the band to continue
they stand by the tiered wedding cake
as thenardier recovers his composure madame thenardier steals one then two pillars from the cake so it collapses on the floor
she then pushes it under the table with her foot
aint it a laugh
aint it a treat
hob nobbin here among the elite
here comes a prince there goes a jew this ones a queer but what can you do
pulling madame thenardier onto the dance floor paris at my feet
paris in the dust
and heres me breaking bread with the upper crust as he pivots madame thenardier stolen silver drops out from madame thenardiers dress
the music stops dead in the clatter
the thenardiers look up as if implying that the silver dropped from the ceiling
the dance continues
monsieur gillenormand motions to the majordomo to remove these unwanted guests
beggar at the feast
master of the dance
life is easy pickings if you grab your chance
everywhere you go law abiding folk doing what is decent but theyre mostly broke
singing to the lord on sundays praying for the gifts hell send but were the ones who take it were the ones who make it in the end
the thenardiers are carried off singing as they go
watch the buggers dance watchem till they drop
keep your wits about you and you stand on top
masters of the land always get our share clear away the barricades and were still there
we know where the wind is blowing money is the stuff we smell and when were rich as croesus jesus
wont we see you all in hell
as they are thrown out the thenardiers steal a tiara and a candlestick
in on a window where two candle burn
valjean prays in the chapel on his knees
hes very weak
next to the crucifix on the altar are valjeans two silver candlesticks in which two candles burn
alone i wait in the shadows i count the hours till i can sleep
i dreamed a dream cosette stood by it made her weep to know i die
alone at the end of the day upon this wedding night i pray take these children my lord to thy embrace and show them grace
god on high hear my prayer take me now to thy care where you are let me be take me now take me there bring me home bring me home
valjean is joined by the ghost of fantine
she takes his hand as he prays
msieur i bless your name
i am ready fantine
msieur lay down your burden
at the end of my days
you raised my child in love shes the best of my life
and you will be with god
cosette and marius rush round the cloisters and enter the chapel in the middle of the cloisters
the sound of the door opening
valjean looks round
its cosette entering followed by marius
tears form in his eyes
cosette goes to him kneels before him takes him in her arms
papa papa i do not understand are you all right
why did you go away
cosette my child
am i forgiven now
thank god thank god ive lived to see this day
marius comes to him
its you who must forgive a thoughtless fool
its you who must forgive a thankless man
its thanks to you that i am living and again i lay down my life at your feet
cosette your father is a saint
when they wounded me he took me from the barricade carried like a babe and brought me home to you
now you are here again beside me now i can die in peace for now my life is blessed
you will live papa youre going to live its too soon too soon to say goodbye
yes cosette forbid me now to die
ill obey i will try
he holds out a letter for her
on this page i write my last confession
read it well when i at last am sleeping
its the story of one who turned from hating a man who only learned to love when you were in his keeping
cosette takes the letter and kisses it
i know it papa
valjean turns back face shining towards the table where the candles burn in the silver candlesticks
there he sees three ghosts waiting for him
the ghost of the bishop
the ghost of fantine
and beyond her watching marius with love the ghost of eponine
fantine comes towards him reaching out her hands
im ready now fantine
come with me where chains will never bind you all your grief at last at last behind you lord in heaven look down on him in mercy forgive me all
my trespasses and take me to your glory
cosette embraces valjean weeping
valjean reaches up his hands and lets the ghost of fantine take them
take my hand ill lead you to salvation take my love for love is everlasting
and remember the truth that once was spoken to love another person is to see the face of god
led by fantine valjean walks out of the chapel towards the cloister
what remains is cosette her head cradled in the lap of the man who has just died
the walls of the cloisters are covered in votive candles
the bishop of digne waits in front of the candles
now valjeans strong and young again
before they reach the wall of candles all three are gone
as they disappear we crane up high over the cloister high over the walls of the convent and we see the paris streets outside
fires are burning and debris is scattered in the streets
dawn is breaking
from far away the sound of an approaching crowd the camera moves over the cobbles as the light of the rising sun reveals the devastation left by a bitter street
past the remains of a barricade
the distant sound of an approaching march
sixteen years later paris
from far off the swelling sounds of the approaching march become the words of a song
do you hear the people sing lost in the valley of the night
it is the music of a people who are climbing to the light for the wretched of the earth more
marchers contd there is a flame that never dies even the darkest night will end and the sun will rise
as the camera rises we see were in the place de la bastille
the triumphal column has long been completed but the great elephant is sadly dilapidated and has become incorporated into an immense barricade three stories high seven hundred feet long
down all the streets that converge on the square we now see the multiple victory marches approaching
they cheer and beat drums as they climb up to the top of the barricade
the people of paris have risen in their tens of thousands
the king has fled
a new republic is born
there in the forefront of one column march marius and cosette
they will live again in freedom in the garden of the lord they will walk behind the plough share they will put away the sword the chain will be broken
and all men will have their reward
as the marchers come nearer we begin to realise how many there are thousand upon thousand
and there marching among them we see ghosts from the past enjolras and the students who died and fantine and eponine and out of the crumbling elephant peers another ghost
the grinning face of gavroche
he climbs out to dance on the elephant as the crowd fill the square
will you join in our crusade
who will be strong and stand with me
somewhere beyond the barricade is there a world you long to see
as the marchers converge there watching them are thenardier and his wife
thenardier gives the marchers a wave of greeting
survivors to the last
do you hear the people sing
say do you hear the distant drums
marchers contd it is the future that they bring when tomorrow comes
now among the marchers we see the ghost of valjean singing with the rest atop the barricade amongst the waving red flags
will you join in our crusade
who will be strong and stand with me
somewhere beyond the barricade is there a world you long to see
do you hear the people sing
say do you hear the distant drums
it is the future that they bring when tomorrow comes
