written by john collee peter weir from blackness a pattern slowly emerges shimmering abstract lines form into waves cresting above steep sided valleys of water
finally the picture settles into a high wide shot of the ocean and an adjacent coastline
in a corner of the screen the last rays of sunlight touch a small dark shape causing it to glow in the gathering darkness a three masted sailing vessel
she passes close enough to touch hawsers as thick as a mans trunk massive black painted timbers muzzles of her great guns projecting from every gun port
as the ship glides past and away from us her name is visible picked out in dull gold on the transom surprise

his servant killick a pig tailed ear ringed man of indeterminate age refills the glass at his elbow
the glass catches the setting sun as it drops below the great casement windows
killick lights a lamp places it next to his captain and retires
absently thankee killick a beautifully drawn chart of the south american coastline
jacks hands place a second chart on top of the first bringing the north east coast of brazil into view

on the final chart we can read navigational symbols and detailed information in fine copperplate script fa

another lamp illuminates st lieutenant tom pullings his pleasant open face marred by a diagonal sabre scar running from brow to chin
he is making a final tour of inspection before lights out
dr stephen maturin a keen naturalist sits at his desk surrounded by specimen jars books and scientific instruments
tom pullings glances in as he moves past the cabin door but the doctor placing weights on some finely balanced structure is too engrossed to notice him
in the quarters for the young gentlemen boys trained from an early age to become officers four lads play at marbles
peter calamy and lord blakeney are arguing about whether a marble was inside outside the circle as their berth mates boyle and williamson wait for the game to resume
it was here
the line is in
it was there
it was out
tell him boyle
it was in i say
the lamp moves on illuminating a fifth midshipman much older than the rest
this is hollom aged
hes a sensitive looking fellow idly strumming a guitar glancing up briefly as tom pullings passes
by the galley stove at the forward end of the gun deck a few of the foremast hands enjoy a last smoke and a mug of grog
faster doudle passes his mug to higgins who guzzles it down greedily one man beckett sits shirtless while another awkward davies brow furrowed with concentration tattoos the first link of
what will be a great chain round becketts waist
joe plaice at one of the oldest men on board stops in the middle of a story as pullings passes everyone knuckling their foreheads in deference to the officer
boys no more than eight or nine years old play a game of jacks with some sheep bones
addison rye and swift are the powder monkeys who ferry powder from the hold to the guns during action
a hundred hammocks swing like strange pods close packed under the immense beams
most of the occupants are already asleep here an arm there a lolling head lights out
on the bosuns command the last of the off duty men climb into their hammocks
the last lights are extinguished
only pullings lamp remains moving up the ladder to
the uppermost or weather deck consists of two parallel gangways linking the forecastle forward to the quarterdeck aft
the lead is dropped from the bows
as pullings walks aft to the quarterdeck as each man lets go his coils of the deep sea line
watch somewhere a bell sounds and the silent figures of the watch call from their stations
lifebuoy alls well
starboard gangway alls well
starboard bow alls well
over this the splash of the lead and the repeated cry of watch there
pullings has joined the officer of the watch nd lieutenant mowett a short tubular man in his early s
jack climbs up a ladder and we see him properly for the first time a heavy set man in his thirties thick blonde hair clubbed at the back at the
binnacle by the ships great wheel
the helmsman bonden a london cockney with a boxers face gives jack their current course
jack nods then moves to the gunwale with pullings
jack sniffs the air and speaks in a low voice
how i do hate a lee shore you think well have long to wait
shrugs intelligence reports had her leaving boston on the th that should put us at least a week ahead
shell be in for a surprise sir
the pun on the name of their ship was unintentional but jack lets out a great hoot of laughter shattering the tense expectant silence
in for a surprise
now thats wit
in for a surprise
pon my word i shall have to tell the doctor
he leaves still laughing
those on the quarterdeck are more amused by jacks unique sense of humour than by the feeble joke itself
calls back dont put her on the reef tom
ill try not to sir
jack looks around the door what do you have there stephen
stephen has wired together the thorax of a birds skeleton and is suspending lead weights from it the breastbone of a frigate bird
do you remark its prodigious strength
jack bends forwards into the candle light sharing his friends keen interest in this strange assembly i do and i am not in the least surprised for it reminds me
of nothing so much as a ship under sail
see here the bowsprit
here the mast and here the backstays running aft
adds another weight ten pounds sixteen ounces
i am preparing a paper for the royal society
jack straightens moving with care between the bottled specimens open books and brass measuring instruments i was thinking when our business here is finished we will have to put in
to recife for provisions
you may care to take a tour round the forests of brazil botanizing and collecting specimens
an anaconda or two
a giant cassowary
i should like it of all things jack
the fog intensifies
white coils of mist drift and eddy over the glassy sea run final titles as the ship moves slowly through the night
the chronometer ticks
the coffee pot swings on its gimbals
jack lies awake in his hanging cot
finally he gives up trying to sleep
strong coffee and light along my topcoat
jack on deck again
six bells and alls well
a hint of daylight to the east
the mist beginning to shift as an offshore breeze picks up
fathoms white shelly sand
four knots sir
bonden is still at the wheel
oi reckon as shes liftin sir if you feels like putting your ead down
jack takes his advice and goes below again
the sky a shade paler
a wind coming up
the lookout vincent peers into the mist
starboard gangway ahoy
hollom the oldest of the midshipmen whose watch it now is appears at his shoulder
what is it vincent
i heard something
hollom peers out into the fog then turns
native fisherman perhaps
midshipman calamy comes running forward
the lead if you please
young calamy takes the lead scrambles into the chains at the bow of the ship and throws out the lead line
hollom takes up a telescope and searches through the eddies of fog
over holloms p
we can hear calamy sounding the depth
sixty fathoms white sand
hollom folds his telescope well
it cant have been a reef marker
calamy unconvinced checks through his own telescope false alarm mr calamy calamy ignores him still scanning the telescope pans
a dark shape in the distance
the mist parts a little
coming straight toward them
close on calamy as he turns to camera screaming enemy on the larboard bow
beat to quarters
jack instantly awake piling out of his bed still dressed
a drum blazes as the off duty watch tumble out of their hammocks and run to their battle stations
rows of wicked looking instruments are hastily thrown on the operating table by padeen maturins servant saws retractors and knives glistening in the lamp light
maturin hurries in blinking sleep out of his eyes as he ties on his black apron behind him higgins the assistant surgeon
little addison and his team of powder monkeys run with their boxes of gunpowder to the
as lamb nagel and the other carpenters bash down cabin partitions transforming the entire gun deck into a single continuous space from the bows to the captains great cabin in
as the crews swarm about their guns grotesque shadows are thrown on the walls and ceiling by the numerous battle lanterns arriving to illuminate the scene
jack and pullings stride the length of the deck toward the bow
they pass crews manning the carronades while others swing the ships small boats out and over the side to be towed behind the ship
jack and pullings join hollom
calamy points forward and a little to the left of the surprises bow
not two miles distant sir
jack and pullings stare through telescopes into the fog which is beginning to lift
jack lowers his telescope
i saw nothing nor heard anything either
shall i ask them men to stand down
jack steps closer to the bow and again lifts his telescope
a slow pan across the sea past a darker patch of fog
what was that
the lens pans back toward the darker area to see a series of flashes
he turns and shouts to the crew lie down
everybody lie down
his words are underscored by a series of distant explosions followed by a deep rumble then a tearing howling sound
chain shot and grape bar and canister shriek through the air
a blizzard of iron
the crew hit the deck the last to drop is bonden hanging grimly to the wheel
close as he tries to bury himself in the deck timbers
the broadside hits the bows and a cloud of splinters and metal scythes the length of the deck at head height
this is rapidly followed by billowing smoke from a small fire now burning on the forecastle
calamy is working at putting the fire out as jack issues a stream of orders
run out the guns
marines to the tops and get that wounded man below
he pulls a gold watch from his pocket and checks the time
hollom is nervously supervising a gun crew which includes davies and his mates
c cast loose now
run out your guns
the men work as a team largely ignoring holloms hesitant instructions
the shot rack is empty shot
theres no shot
as red coated marines led by captain howard climb into the rigging jack calls to his clerk note the time mr
an anxious tom pullings appears
shes out of our range sir
jack calls to his sailing master allen
you must lay me alongside her at pistol shot
allen purses his lips
he knows what hes doing and slightly resents the instruction mr
pullings bow chasers to fire as she bears
shes crossing their bows about a mile distant
pullings is racing up the larboard gangway to the forecastle past men stacking hammocks as blast protection
gun captains stand ready the slow match burning in the tubs
fire on the uproll
the little drummers huge eyes are fixed on pullings face
the ship rolls
the drum roll is all but drowned by the blast of the guns
the smoke clears the gunners look on baffled as their balls bounce harmlessly off the side of the enemy ship
in greek witchcraft
never seen the like of it damn and blast you
see to your guns
fire for the masts and rigging
as the enemys murderous long guns run out again
her french ensign clearly visible as she swings broadside on to the approaching surprise again her side lights up in a series of red flashes
by the dim light of a battle lantern stephen struggles to hold a wounded man on the table his feet slipping in pools of blood on the deck
more sand on the floor mr
the slightly hung over higgins reaches for the sand bucket and is thrown over by the awful jarring shock as the acherons third broadside hits home
the captains crockery smashes to the deck
killick cursing freely stows what he can
shards of timber implode followed by a great spout of water knocking the massive awkward davies sideways as he runs for the ladder carrying two cannon balls
a second explosion a second jet of water and davies finding his feet starts yelling for the carpenter
wood and lead
follow davies as he runs up to the gun deck with the shot under his arms past the powder monkeys addison and swift canisters of gun powder slung over their
shoulders then he sees mr
lamb the carpenter
as lamb dives for the ladder
davies arrives to find a gaping hole opposite where his own gun once stood
its crew lie scattered horribly wounded or dead
the dismounted gun and twelve pound shot are rolling around dangerously
hollom the sole survivor is backed against the bulkhead cradling an injured arm
calamy emerges from the smoke meets daviess horror struck gaze and takes command
get those bodies overboard
to hollom mr
hollom sits immobilized by fear
calamy grabs the poulterer jemmy ducks who has been rescuing the ships goat aspasia
jemmy leave the damned goat and take mr
the ship heels as she turns
midshipman blakeney calamys rival in the game of marbles turns to see the dismounted gun rolling free
he throws a hammock net under it stopping its roll before it crushes calamy against the bulkhead
calamy shoots him a brief look of gratitude and runs aft
blakeney carries on shouting to the powder monkeys more shot
in the great jagged hole on the gun deck where the gun was destroyed jack stands framed a wrathful soot stained figure
he glances back at his men hunched and ready itching to fire
jack bellows steady
wait for it
to see the two ships about to pass abreast the surprise heading south as it were the enemy ship north
the french vessel is clearly the bigger ship and from both come the sounds of shouted orders and the thunder of drums
they will pass broadside to broadside yards apart
jack watching the enemy judging the moment
the great guns go off all together
the cannons leaping back between their crews
jack snatches a powder monkey addison out of the way of the lethal recoil
smoke clears to reveal holes in the enemys foretopsail a bowline hanging loose but again many of her balls have failed to penetrate the enemy timbers
by all thats holy what is that ship made of
his question coincides with a third full broadside from the frenchman
the surprises wheel shattered
bonden thrown aside mr
watt jerked back to the taffrail the mizzenmast hit
a rope sheers and joe plaice is smacked on the skull by a swinging boom
midshipman blakeney running up on deck goes to help plaice and is struck down by a flying splinter a shocking wound to his upper right arm
jack is half way up the ladder when he falls scored across the forehead by a musket ball
he is dimly aware of small arms cracking above his head and someone trying to lift him
belay there ye poxed son of a whore
you must go below sir you must let me help you below
jack puts a hand to his bleeding forehead and drags himself back up the ladder
a furious exchange of fire between captain howards marines and the sharpshooters in the enemys rigging
howard a big red faced man is in his element laughing madly every time he scores a hit
jack emerges into bloody chaos screams of the wounded all around the enemy ship moving astern in mist and gun smoke
he wipes blood from his eye as he raises his telescope
as the ship passes her name is visible on the transom acheron
jack lowers his telescope
pullings expression spells catastrophe its the rudder
grim faced jack hobbles to the shattered taff rail sees bonden soaked having climbed down onto the stern post
shouts up its shot away below the waterline
stephen up to his armpits in blood operating on a wounded man looks up to see three more seriously injured men arriving
he pauses aware of some change
why are we not firing
spirals of drifting smoke
blackened bleeding men their guns pointing at nothing no steerage
were fish in a barrel the fog has rolled back like a great curtain to reveal the two frigates
the badly damaged surprise drifting rudderless
the acheron most of her sails intact beginning the turn which will put her in position to finish off the surprise
jack is joined by allen as the enemy vessel starts crossing their wake
hes coming about sir
should i strike the colours
all eyes on jack poised on the brink of awful defeat
im afraid theres nothing else for it
jack looks from the wall of fog to the three little boats they are towing astern
damned if there aint
well tow her
sudden feverish activity running and shouting as men scramble down into the boats
davies settles himself beside nagel in the cutter turning to look at the approaching acheron
puffs of smoke from its bow chasers
sail trimmers away warley make what sail you can
stern chasers to fire when shes in range
gouts of water from the enemy gunfire rise not fifty yards from them acting as little needed encouragement for the boats to get clear of the stern and pull around
towards the bows as
men scramble up the ratlines and through the shattered rigging
two long brass nine pounders set up through the open windows of the captains day cabin open fire on the approaching acheron
warley captain of the maintop directs his men about the mares nest of rigging getting a tattered top sail to fill with what little breeze there is
sharp now with that fancy line
to the clew line from the reef points cully double up and run her back again
through pullings telescope the enemy ship coming straight at them her guns now getting the range of the surprise
shes gaining on us
start the water carronades over the side
crewmen furiously at work cutting the ropes securing the guns on the quarterdeck
water spouts from the pumps while at the same time the quarterdeck guns tumble into the ocean
note they only abandon guns on the quarterdeck not their main armament on the gun deck
jack races to the bows
towlines strain as the three small boats pull the great ship toward the curtain of fog and cloud
he yells to the straining oarsmen pull
pull for your lives
the men heave on their oars faces bathed in sweat the towlines taut behind them dragging the surprise toward the safety of the fog bank
to see the surprise slipping into the cover of fog and low cloud only her top masts visible before they too disappear
jack joins his officers looking back into the white out in the direction of the enemy
no calls no shouts
allen signal the men in the boats to head due east
allen hurries toward the bows as behind them the fog is momentarily illuminated by flashes of gunfire from their pursuer
calamy in the prow of the jolly boat sees allen on the ship signalling the turn to eastward
calamy signals to bonden in the stern of the jolly boat
urgent whisper starboard haul
one side stops rowing and the boat turns
a low angle the ship coming slowly toward us
beyond the rowers strain at their oars the great ship rearing out of the mist above them as though carried on their backs
somewhere astern and to the left jack can hear shouting on the acheron
flashes of cannon fire directed away from them
hes beating inshore
keep rowing the tortured sounds of exhausted men rowing as skeins of mist drift away to reveal a dim yellow moon
on the horizon the battered ship in silhouette lines stretching ahead to her three small boats
some of the wreckage has been cleared aside the wounded moved below
we can hear their moans and the constant creaking of the bilge pumps
jack and his officers scan the moonlit sea through telescopes
jacks telescope pov a long slow pan along the dark horizon
i believe weve lost her sir
jack collapses his telescope
pass the word to ship oars in the jolly boats
night the rowers slump forwards in their seats their hands raw and crabbed
jack moves down a ladder past lamb coming up from below soaking wet and exhausted with his mate nagel
three feet of water in the hold sir but the pumps are keeping it from gaining
very good mr
the constant creaking and sloshing of the pumps becomes louder as he continues down past men handing up food and powder from the flooded levels below
stephen his face spattered with blood is adjusting the wick of a lantern when jack arrives beside him sotto whats the butchers bill
six dead thirteen wounded
he notices the gash on jacks forehead your head
brushes him away later
stephen raises his lantern to reveal groaning bloodstained men close packed in the gloom
together they make the rounds passing men propped upright by their mates pale with shock or tense with pain some struggling to breathe some barely alive
jack clasps hands whispers encouragement
a bandaged head swims into the glow of the lamp streaked with blood and deeply unconscious
whos this joe plaice
sotto a severe depressed fracture of the skull
i am not sure he will see out the night
moving on to another barely recognizable face young blakeney pale and sweaty breathing hard from the pain and the blood loss
just a broken arm sir
jack looks at stephen whose expression is grim but he says nothing steering jack forward to the foot of the ladder where they can speak more privately i will do
i know you were close to his father
jack nods defeat weighing heavily and makes to go
stephen puts a restraining hand on his shoulder
one moment jack let me look at that brow of yours
its a scratch
i will tell you if its a scratch or not
jack submits meekly and sits on a lower rung while stephen puts a bandage round his forehead how did he find us stephen
seven weeks sailing and he happened in darkness on our exact position
he really is a phantom unless she was alerted to our presence and looking for us
how could that be
the french have their spies in britain as elsewhere
jack astonished youre saying there are traitors in the admiralty
i am saying do not imagine it was a lone privateer who did this to us
he is working for napoleon himself with access to all that tyrant commands overtly and covertly
so do not let defeat weigh too heavily upon you
wan dawn light reflects off the ceiling onto the bloody bandaged officers conducting an angry post mortem as killick serves coffee
call her a frigate
you ask me shes no more a frigate than a painted dutchman
more like a ship of the line a two decker moren a frigate
mowett is trying to staunch a persistent nosebleed
one does wonder what manner of hull she has
our balls seemed to bounce right off her
jack enters his head newly bandaged
he walks past the seated officers and stands looking out through the stern windows
the officers continue their conversation though their words are intended for jack she had the weather gauge and long eighteens which could hit us beyond our effective range
thats the sum of it and guns to our i counted the muzzle flashes
it was an unfair match no dishonor in defeat no dishonor at all
jack still has his back to them
he puts his hand in his pocket and finds something there the shattered fragments of his gold pocket watch
sighs well we can patch up our main and mizzen the foresail is too far gone so well bend our spare
jack finally turns
allen is confident with basic repairs we can get home as we are
allowing for a stop in jamaica
at port royal we can haul her into dry dock and hopefully get her home without
were not going home
an expectant hush
killick is all ears as he picks up the coffee cups and places them carefully on a silver tray
what is our purpose here gentlemen
why were we sent
to punish a blackguard privateer who has decimated our atlantic whaling fleet and now threatens to do the same in the pacific
are we to leave those ships to his mercy and slink back into portsmouth another defeat to add to the list
is that what we draw our wages for
i say we pursue her and pay her back with interest with respect captain she could be half way to cape horn by the time were repaired and underway
sternly then theres not a moment to lose
killick exits the cabin with the tray of coffee cups
as he passes them to his mate black bill killick a whisper were for the horn
word passes like lightning from the wounded in the orlop to the beak of the ship the horn you say
in this condition
what news mates heading for where
a few of the old surprises have gathered for a smoke all of them men whove sailed with jack before jittery alcoholic higgins loyal nehemiah slade sharp faced tobacco chewing
faster doudle and the big welshman awkward davies still shaken by the loss of his gun crew
higgins were for hell in a hand barrow if you ask my opinion slade im game
if the captain says we can take her we can take her
can we catch her is the question
and if we do whats different
shell just hold us off with them long eighteens til she sends us all to the bottom
all for what
ill tell you for what matey
shes a privateer loaded with all the gems of araby
think of the gold
think of the prize money
you men jump to it
the gratings are hauled aside and light floods down into the gun deck
part of a huge tree trunk spare timber for repairs is manhandled by a dozen crewmen
one long pull
crewmen labour at the capstan
two six heave
two six heave
the huge log rises from below and hangs suspended from its gantry
jack shouts down from the quarterdeck have her placed along the gunwale for now mr
hollar and the guns moved to that side also
men are hanging in the rigging throwing down damaged sections of rope
all clear below
jack dodges the falling rope moving back past nagel and his men who are cutting out damaged sections of the gunwale with saws and adzes prizing up decking and wrestling
with the wrecked steering mechanism
jack looks down to where pullings and others have lifted the broken rudder from its hinges
the ship swarming with men cutting splicing hammering and hauling
every able bodied soul hard at work
an optimistic breeze has picked up fluttering the tattered ensign
the deck is now sloping at a forty five degree angle
killick hands a sandwich to pullings who passes it down to jack
damn this wind mr
the acheron will be making a hundred and fifty miles a day in this
aye but hugging the coast and stopping to board the odd merchantman jack smiles at this and bites into his sandwich
to the uphill side carpenters are erecting a scaffolding over the side of the ship
the ships copper plated keel is partly revealed as the men clamber and slip about on the steeply sloping side erecting scaffolding
the tropical heat resounds with shouts curses and hammering
carpenters working inside the scaffolding are fitting new sections of wood into the holes low in her hull
the new piece of wood is an almost perfect fit
lamb marks the places where it is jamming
then he begins to work on it with his rasp
among tropical fish a diver a greek crewman old sponge father of young sponge a hammer at his belt plugs a few smaller holes with hemp fibre then surfaces to
in greek the smaller bit
that bit there
young sponge passes him a piece of lead and some nails and old sponge dives again
descending into the sea as
roaring flames flying sparks the clang of metal on metal
a forge has been set up
powder monkeys sweat on the bellows
the ships blacksmith is churning out iron bolts pintles and gudgeons which are snatched away by nagel with tongs and thrown into a bucket of water to cool
a few yards away wood chips fly from lambs adze as the ships massive new stern post takes shape
the new rudder is laid out flat already cut to its final shape and being strengthened with great nails and iron bands which nehemiah slade and awkward davies are nailing
the hammering travels through the ship to
blakeney with his splinted arm jerks awake feverish and confused
not through my nose
you were dreaming
blakeney looks around disoriented and finds calamy by his side
joe plaice told me when you die they sew you up in your hammock with the last stitch through your nose
to make sure youre not just sleeping you know old joe always telling stories
is it true though
about the last stitch
come on youll be stitching me in mine first
blakeney drifting not through my nose
youll tell them
nods nor any other part of you
trying to make light of it though he fears blakeney is dying
calamy has fallen asleep by blakeneys side
he wakes to find stephen sniffing blakeneys wound
is it mending sir
no im afraid it will not do
blakeney is lowered onto the table delirious
calamy holds his head and padeen maturins giant manservant his legs which are lashed together
it is the laudanum speaking
you will be a regular nelson
he tests the edge of his knife with his thumb
calamy places the leather gag between blakeneys teeth
padeen mumbles a gaelic prayer
stephen turns and grips blakeney shattered arm
a sharp grating noise as stephen works out of shot cutting off the arm
close on stephen lips compressed utterly focussed
he puts down the bloody knife and reaches for the spatula in the pail of hot tar
blakeney has not uttered a sound though he is shaking uncontrollably and his face is wet with tears
calamy has tears in his eyes also
stephen finishes his work breathing hard a gentle smile to there
i have never seen a braver patient
an exhausted calamy keeps vigil by blakeneys cot
the boy wakes and looks for calamy in the darkness
is that you
i dreamed they cut my arm off
then he realizes with sudden horror that it wasnt a dream you would have died else
blakeneys eyes brim with tears and he turns away come
you can still sup your grog with your left
and i shall take your turn at marbles
mowett stands in the cross trees making a final check on the lashings round the new mizzen top
below him the great work is nearing completion men swarming like ants over every part of the hull
mowett climbs down past faster doudle who has one leg looped through the shrouds and is splicing a rope with both hands and his teeth
farther down a patched sail is being furled up tight in its gaskets
beyond that at the base of the main mast a fascinated group of men have gathered to watch the doctor trepanning joe stephens drill carves out a neat disc of
bone to reveal a purplish mass which he starts spooning from the cavity
a small crowd of crewmen pause in their work watching the doctor with morbid fascination as he drops the purple stuff in a dish
slade shouts is them his brains doctor
no that is just blood
these are his brains
exposing them to view
several of the crew move in for a closer look
the armourer hands stephen a flattened coin which he begins to screw in place over the cavity as the old hands whisper his praises to the men who have never
seen stephen at work
physician he is not one of your common surgeons
cured prince billy of the marthambles and the strong fives wouldnt look at you for under ten guineas on land
knows his birds and beasts too boyo show him a beetle and hell tell you what its thinking
a wind causes the ship to turn on its moorings stirring impatiently like a racehorse ready to be off as
jack jumps down from the mizzen ratlines
let us be off mr
all hands to make sail
barefoot men are suddenly running to their stations racing above and below running out along the bowsprit up the ratlines along the yards
a small group supposed to be assisting hollom are contrasting slow off the mark bear a hand there you fellows
the men he is addressing shoot him a look of distaste which unsettles hollom slightly then they assist him pulling on a rope up and down sir thick and dry
men strain on the capstan bars
the anchor bursting up out of the sea
the shrouds darken with climbing figures framed against the sun
hollar staring up as the sails unfurl and fill with wind
cheerly there in the foretop our william
hands to the braces
men slide down ropes from high amongst the shrouds then swing out and drop down to the deck like monkeys pulling ropes and sails tight with the weight of their
the ship spreading its wings
a sudden cracking of canvas as she turns and runs directly downwind
the sun has sunk lower
bonden solid as the rock of gibraltar is back at the helm the wind stronger and directly behind
boyle boyle heaves the log clear of the ships side
the log line races out on its reel
boyle checks the run pulls the pin
ten and a half knots sir
jack makes no comment but the news seems to please him
the great hull powers past us
killick prepares toasted cheese in his small serving area
from inside the cabin the sound of a violin and a cello tuning up
killick glances irritably at the door and elbows his mate black bill
here we go again scrape scrape screech screech and never a tune you could dance to not if you were drunk as daveys sow
jack and stephen are both keen amateur musicians jack violin stephen cello
as stephen completes his tuning jack experiments with a refrain
is that one i know or are we breaking new ground
i am trying to remember that air they played all those years ago at the governors house in port mahon
you remember when we first met
corelli if im not mistaken
he plays another riff if that is your a you are very much so
this is a
jack corrects his a string plays another few bars or locatelli
pom pom pom pom all i remember is you being unable to sit in your seat the entire performance
aye and you practising apon that poor bishop with your puddings athwart the starboard gumbrils or some such arrant nonsense
that was off toulon during the blockade
at our first meeting they played this he plays a short refrain no
entirely off the mark
pom pom pom i have now he plays another variation enjoying the game or was it something like this
cello answers violin as they hand it back and forth improvising freely now with an infinity of variations sometimes playing together sometimes separately suddenly hitting it the music soaring and
continuing over the tiny ship on the vastness of the ocean
from its side cotton wool puffs of smoke
a rippling broadside the crews sweating over their guns
and pitch em up
its spars and rigging we want
mowett timing the gap between each broadside
three minutes ten sir
not good enough
we must fire three broadsides to her two
turning to blakeney who though much recovered still looks pale and a little unsure of himself
think you can supervise a gun
as you will
spitfire hop to it
blakeney takes command of the gun
to one side calamy is in charge of beelzebub on the other side hollom is now directing sudden death
once again the orders are given and the crews now competing with each other go through the sequence out tompions cast loose your guns cartridge
run out your gun
as another broadside shakes the deck stephen hauls his collecting net on board and empties out a glistening array of sea creatures shrimps squid and minnows glinting like opals in
the pink light
two minutes five sir
its a race
jacks orders are just a formality the sequence having become so automatic now
run out your guns
seconds ticking away on mowetts stopwatch barrels float on the sea a hundred yards out
as she bears from forward aft
point your guns
the black ship spouting tongues of flame the water around the target barrels erupting in great spouts
two minutes dead
another splendidly coordinated broadside resounds through the ship as the powder monkeys come racing down through the dreadnought screens to the magazine and back with more cartridge
for them too its a race little addison just ahead of swift rye hot on his heels
the sound of the guns is faint down here at least when heard from stephens perspective his ears are stuffed with wax
he is surrounded by his specimen bottles and he looks from his microscope to his ledger where he is documenting the array of aquatic life forms
he removes his ear plugs but the noise of the guns is deafening and he hastily replaces them
mowett watches the second hand of his stopwatch glancing up as he notes the concentrated fury of the men swabbing ramming heaving in heaving out firing at a raft this
and he stops the watch as the first gun fires
one minute forty nine sir
his voice is drowned by the firing of the other guns in close succession entirely demolishing the raft the sound mixing with cheering and the frenzied hammering of nagel and
his mates as the gun deck partitions are cheerfully re erected
the table is dragged back into place and settings laid for dinner
jack enters his face flushed with victory
what do you have for us tonight
which its soused hoggs face
the sky a great canopy of stars the ship racing onwards through the warm night
crew men and the recovering wounded have come up on deck
now they sit around in groups supping their grog
someone produces a jaw harp someone else a drum
a guitar is passed from hand to hand stopping with black bill who sings a ballad in an african dialect
theres an effortless integration of race and rank of age and nationality bonds forged by battle and hardship
old sponge gets up and dances a greek dance obviously a favorite among the crew
cheering and cat calls
lanterns coming up from below
more dancing insults in many languages and a song
boneparte boneparte that red faced son of an old french fart hey ho stamp and go stamp and go stamp and go hey ho stamp and go the singing mixes
with the end of a lively dinner given by jack for his officers including a special guest young with your permission sir mr
mowett has composed a short poem in honour of our mission
lets hear it mr
reactions around the table glasses re filled in anticipation
mowett stands and declaims with a number of precise airy gestures like a conductor
our brotherhood some old some new
in blood baptized in strength renewed
in purpose unified and true
all thoughts of home forsaken
where duty leads us there we go
nor rest nor comfort shall we know
until the unrepentant foe is boarded sunk or taken raising their glasses aye
hear him hear him
sunk or taken
aye and when we do take her we shall give her to tom pullings as his first command
if he dont die before then
bumpers up tom a toast to wives and sweethearts
they raise their glasses to wives and sweethearts
and may they never meet
amid the laughter someone bumps blakeneys stump
he winces then puts a brave face on it blakeney to jack i believe you knew nelson sir
i had the honour of serving under him at the nile
mowett the bottle stands by you sir
as the bottle moves on in fact i dined with him twice and he spoke to me on both occasions
the table goes quiet
blakeney is wide eyed though partly from his strenuous efforts to appear sober
the first time he said to me may i trouble you for the salt sir
i have always tried to say it as close as i could the second time someone had offered him a boat cloak on a cold night and he said no
he was quite warm his zeal for his king and country kept him warm
amid the general agreement hear him hear him etc
stephen is noticeably silent
it sounds absurd i know and were it another man you would cry out oh what pitiful stuff and dismiss it as mere enthusiasm but with him you felt your
raising his glass to lord nelson
stephen joins on the toast but jack knows that his friend deplores such overt patriotism and seeks to draw him back in with a joke
you see those two weevils doctor
he points at a faint movement amongst the crumbs of a ships biscuit
which would you choose
the table tenses with anticipation of one of the captains jokes
there is not a scrap of difference
they are the same species of curculio
but suppose you had to choose
then i would choose the right hand weevil it has a perceptible advantage in both length and breadth
there i have you
you are completely dished
dont you know in the navy you must always choose the lesser of two weevils
he thunders with laughter the rest joining in breathless with mirth tears of laughter streaming down their faces pon my life
he who would pun would pick a pocket
dye not smoke it doctor
poker faced sure there would be some poor thin barren minds that would catch at such a paltry clench
then he too cracks a smile and joins in their laughter the crew continue with their own celebration
the excitement penetrates joe plaices stupor
never having woken since the trepanning he suddenly opens his eyes and speaks
and the righteous shall inherit the earth
the men around him stare in amazement
you hear that
he said something
say something else joe handy with that gasket shouts up to the quarterdeck he spoke doctor
joe plaice spoke the officers have appeared on deck with their coffee and stephen raises a hand in acknowledgment
midshipmen calamy rye and boyle are eating from a bag of broken biscuits ships nuts as they sit perched up in the rigging
on seeing jack they break into their own song
our captain was very good to us
he dipped his prick in phosphorus
it shed a light all through the night
and steered us through the bosphorus
jack pretends not to have heard but he cant hide his smile
beside him in a chair sits blakeney his empty jacket sleeve pinned to his front nelson style laughing incredulously at the older boys cheek
from somewhere on the forecastle warley and his top men start singing
farewell and adieu you fine spanish ladies farewell and adieu to you ladies of spain
the older midshipman hollom joins in his fine voice soaring effortlessly over the others hijacking their roistering ballad and converting it to something much more poignant
for weve received orders to sail for old england
perhaps we shall never more see you again his singing is appreciated by stephen on the quarterdeck
what a wonderfully true voice mr
hollom does possess
killick and nagel are less than impressed with hollom and sing over him led by orrage the cook
come all you thoughtless young men a warning take by me and never leave your happy homes to sail the raging sea
the surprise sailing away from us the chorus drifting across the darkness
day the colours are changing from the rich hues of the tropics to the cold muted colours of colder more southerly climes
still the surprise sails on fingers trace a course down the east coast of south america
another more detailed chart is placed on top of the first
this ones by colnett sir
he travelled with captain cook and carried a pair of arnotts chronometers
jack finds their position and marks it with pencil
a knock on the door
officers and crew are now dressed according to the change in climate couple of the men to see you sir
without looking up show them in
the door opens to reveal nagel and warley carrying something
a scale model of a ship inches long perfect in every detail
jack takes it delighted the name picked out in gold on the stern acheron
it were warleys idea sir
i thought she were familiar like then i remembered where id seen her in boston during the peace
warley nods yes sir
shes yankee built
i seen them working on her something right strange about her scantlings
then i seen them balls bounce off her an i got to thinking
if you look here sir
one side opens up
he pulls a side off the model exposing its construction
mister nagel here done it just like i seen her a third layer tween the outer and inner ribbing diagonal bracing see
just like the u
constitution our pounders couldnt penetrate except at close range
he passes the model to allen
an extra ration of rum for these men from my private store
shaking his head which i was saving for saluting day sir
rouse it up killick and a bottle for mr
allen and me
let us live whilst were alive
killick goes to get the bottles jack hunkers down to bring his gaze level with the ship as though studying its tiny occupants
hes vulnerable here
he taps the stern windows
cross her stern rake her with a broadside through her length
but how to get close enough
past those long eighteens
thats the devil of it
b surprise quarterdeck day the surprise has stopped level with a spanish merchantman which lies three hundred yards away headed in the opposite direction
the two boats have hove to and are communicating by megaphone stephen translating the spanish captains words he says they were chased for three days till they finally our ran
forty gun french privateer headed due south
thank him and let us be off
the spanish captain already making sail waves and shouts a greeting which stephen calls back to him
what did he say there
a spanish farewell
may no new thing arrive
new things being generally by their nature bad
stephen is with blakeney re bandaging the younger mans stump
blakeney looks away his eyes moving over the doctors collection of books learned texts in french spanish greek and latin do you have a manual of exercises sir
physical exercises to make the left arm as powerful as the right once was
i think that will happen with usage at least to a certain extent
but not completely
i will never be whole again will i
no but you will adapt to your new situation the natural world shows us any number of examples of how that is possible
blakeney bites his lip you know my father was a great fighting captain
it was always his expectation i would follow in his footsteps
i worry that with this arm i will now be good for nothing but book learning and philosophy
like me you mean
becoming tearful i cannot use a sextant cannot tie a knot or climb the rigging
cannot even dress myself
what chance to i have now of even making first lieutenant
you have every chance
you hear me every chance
only the other day i heard the captain singing your praises
your courage your fortitude in battle your skill at logarithms and double elevations whatever they may be
and when you are rated lieutenant you shall have someone to tie your bootlaces for you
aye and help you with your jacket
here take my handkerchief
i believe we are summonsed to dinner
the maintop captain warley shouts to the deck his breath forming in the frosty air sail on the larboard bow
jack throwing on a heavy boat cloak running for the ladder killick behind him trying to get a scarf about jacks neck and a cap on his head
follow jack as he runs up the ratlines over the futtock shrouds then up the topmast shrouds finally arriving at the very top of the mast to join warley and
hull down two points off the larboard beam
jack takes the telescope
just the tips of masts the hull below the horizon
shes a frigate all right but no way of knowing if she be the phantom
beyond the distant ship a line of black clouds
jack and pullings slide to the deck on parallel back stays as careless as a couple of midshipmen
jack shouting set studdingsails and top gallants
then wet the sails and have the idlers placed along the rail
pullings and hollar bark out their orders
men race to obey
jack steps up on the gunwale spying out the distant ship
blakeney nearby rests his telescope on calamys shoulder focussing with his left hand
is it him sir
touch wood mr
and i fancy she plans to out run us
maturin to join us he loves a good chase
blakeney goes below
above the topmen release more sail which is tightened by the men on deck hauling on cables
those not working sit on a row along the windward gunwale like the crew of an ocean racing yacht to counterbalance the pull of the sails
their speed is so great green seas are now sweeping the forecastle
a man falls and rolls into the scuppers
lifelines fore and aft
calamy heaves the lead and reads the log line then shouts back to jack twelve knots sir
heeled over under a great press of sail her copper showing as she clefts the waves
lined up along the starboard rails the crew look back at their captain riding the ship like a charioteer one eye aloft on the creaking topmost spar
were cracking on eh
well be cracking off presently if he doesnt watch it
no he knows this ship
he knows what she can take
he touches wood just the same and looks at joe plaice who gives a meaningful roll of his eyes
ahead the bank of storm clouds loom gunmetal grey
pullings knocks and enters with an anxious looking mr
lamb with whom he has been arguing a point
we can just see her topsails
shes made her turn westwards
i cant vouch for the mizzen sir not round cape horn
ill not lose her now
set a course westwards
both men accept this and leave
the wind has increased considerably the deck sloping like the roof of a house the masts bending like coach whips
pullings and lamb are looking up at the mizzenmast which is making ominous creaks and groans
mr hollar rig preventer backstays
warps and light hawsers to the mastheads
jack stares ahead to the darkening sky as they move across a switchback landscape of massive rolling waves
better get below mr
better get some food in you
before it turns nasty
wide to see the two ships
the surprise and the acheron with a mile of sea between them
its like some great ocean race with neither prepared to take in canvas despite the appalling conditions
they are running fast before a dangerous following sea a landscape of hills and valleys the whole thing in terrifying motion
the forecastle now vanishes in foam with every plunge rising each time with water pouring over the waist and spouting from her scuppers
killick comes up with the coffee pot inside his jacket
jack drinks from the spout peering ahead into the murk
a wild unruly part of him is loving this
above him more top men struggle up the rigging with the mast drawing crazy figure of eights on a rushing sky
the dog watch are wolfing their food mugs and dinner plates sliding over the table
crewmen walk up hill to the grog barrel down their ration and head up top again
you reckon captain will keep chasing him round the horn with every stitch of canvas flying
i reckon hed chase him to the gates of hell if he has to
and thats where were all going if he doesnt take in sail
since his injury joe plaices startlingly random pronouncements have acquired the quality of an oracle
the wind rising from yell to shriek
waves blown flat by it the ship travelling at a drunken sideways angle across a raging expanse of white foam
four men on the wheel lashed to it with the air around them full of water
in the distance a tower of black rock on the rim of the sea distant rollers breaking against it and surging up to a preposterous height
jack looks up at the great press of canvas as he paces the quarterdeck the officers glancing from the sails back to strike the topgallants
men gratefully rush to the ratlines and begin climbing to the masts
stephen staggers up onto deck
jack calls to him pointing at the black rock
cape horn doctor
stephen stares across at the legendary cape
hes struggling with his pocket glass when a lurch of the ship sends him tumbling
as men help him below warley the maintop captain reports to the bosun
hollar to warley help them with that mizzen topgallant
you go too mr
hollom looks desperate as he follows warley up the ratlines of the mizzen
mizzen topgallant mast warley works frantically
hes out on the yardarm high above the raging sea
he shouts for hollom to join him but hollom is still in the top some twenty feet below unable or unwilling to climb any higher
wide to see the ship
warley working on the swaying mizzen
the bow swinging a couple of points further south
wood and rope straining as they wrestle to turn
then a tremendous crack as the mizzen topmast splits and flies backward into the sea carrying warley along with it
sail and cordage falling over the men at the wheel
a loose block and tackle swinging murderously in the gale
jack fights free from the tangle of ropes as warley vanishes in the foam
the mizzenmast is acting as a sea anchor dragging the ships head northwards toward the black rocks
jack grabs a speaking trumpet as warley briefly reappears
swim for the wreckage man
then to pullings
as crewmen scramble frantically into the rigging jack turns back to see warley desperately swimming toward the trailing wreckage his mates shouting encouragement over the howling wind
with sails reduced the ship perceptibly slows but the dragging wreckage is swinging the ship broadside on to the waves
pullings runs to jack pointing to the trailing mass of ropes and mast
its acting as a sea anchor
we must cut it loose sir
warley still struggling to reach the wreckage but going under with each wave
jack agonized makes his decision
awkward davies scrambles up the ladder with an axe but loses his footing and falls sprawling over the quarterdeck
jack grabs the axe and attacks the ropes
hes joined by nagel who has run to assist before realizing that the man overboard is his friend warley
set to then
nagels face is a mask of horror but he obeys jacks orders and starts chopping
he and jack work shoulder to shoulder matching blow for blow the prow keeps turning wave after wave coming at right angles to the ship
a hatch cover is torn off by the force of water a sudden mighty deluge pouring down into the lower levels drenching the men and swamping the guns
hollar yells below all hands to the pumps
jack and nagel keep hacking at the tangle of ropes
knocking chips off the railing in their urgency to cut free the dragging mast
finally they succeed
the last of the ropes whips away the broken mizzen disappears aft and the ship swings southward away from the rocks
the wreckage is swept away by the next wave leaving warley struggling his last chance of getting back to the ship gone
then another wave breaks over him and he is gone
nagel is bereft
jack lowers his head
killick and black bill
hes been at it again
whos that then
jack sits at his desk
the model of the acheron that warley helped make sits accusingly in front of him
stephen pours him a glass on wine and one for himself
the deaths in actual battle are the easiest
beat for my own part those who die under the knife or from some consequent infection i have to remind myself that it is the enemy who killed them and
beat warley was a casualty of war as surely as if a french ball had taken him
obviously the death still weighs on his conscience
offering the wine at the same time
he breaks off jack at the same time what
stephen hesitates aware that he has to proceed carefully you know that i wear two hats on every voyage
i am the captains particular friend and supporter but also i am the ships doctor in which later capacity i am party to
he catches a steely glint in jacks eye and breaks off
you dont want me to continue
stiffly on the contrary
i insist on it
there is talk below decks of turning back
or rather that we should have turned back some weeks ago
of course the men would follow lucky jack anywhere and usually in the confident expectation of victory
but that of course is the problem
what is the problem
that you are not accustomed to defeat jack
that you have taken it too personally
that chasing this larger faster ship with its long guns is beginning to smack of pride which goeth before destruction
its not pride nor anything like it its a question of duty
duty ah yes
the naval signal for end of discussion
you can be as satiric as you like stephen but i have my orders
she is attacking our whalers
without whales we have no boot polish nor any soap nor oil for our lamps not to oil our sabres and muskets
destroying our whalers could win the war for napoleon
which is why we must catch this acheron
as a man of learning surely you can see that
at whatever the cost
any whatever cost i choose to pay
and i will calculate that myself stephen without reference to your friends in the ward room
an icy wind whips at the men working on the temporary mizzen mast
hollom half way up the rigging is relaying instructions between the men in the rigging and the men on deck cast off
the new yard flails around on its pulley bashing dangerously against the mast
almost claiming nagel belay
pulling craning upwards
the topmens shouted commands are whipped away by the gale
jack joins him still smarting from the conversation with stephen well have to go further south get around this bloody west wind
how far south
as far as is necessary mr
the sixtieth parallel if need be
the sun a pale anaemic disc gradually disappearing behind layers of cloud
the wind is a constant shrill whistle through the rigging a sound like some infernal drill which rises and falls but never ceases
the sun rising in a clear sky which turns a sapphire blue
white ice islands lie all around them some a pure rosy pink
others bright ultramarine
and still the wind howls driving them further south
mowett passes his telescope to stephen maturin
as stephen studies some seals on an ice beach mowett launches into verse shouting against the wind then we upon the globes last verge shall go to view the ocean
leaning on the sky from thence our rolling neighbours we shall know and on the hidden world securely pry
he is interrupted by a bundle of guns clattering on board from one of the small boats
they are followed by mr howard clad in several thicknesses of sealskin and carrying a brace of dead penguin
the ship scudding onwards soundless at this distance but for the chilling high pitched whistle of the wind
an iceberg passes in foreground fantastic shapes of ice like a gothic cathedral sculpted by the elements
hanging stoves provide some feeble warmth
men huddle close to them their breath condensing or lie shivering in their bunks unable to sleep for the cold
hollar appears with a lantern
rise and shine
show a leg there tumble up tumble up sleepers awake
as the previous watch arrive downstairs numb and dazed from the cold the next watch emerge from their hammocks and dress
no one speaks
the officers take their places at dinner
once again its penguin stew
pullings comes in with an unexpected smile on his face and whispers something to jack
the others seem to know whats going on all except stephen who looks baffled
pray what is there to celebrate
jack holds up his hand for silence
a series of creaks and groans from the ship
the coffee pot tilts on its gimbals
we have made our turn northward doctor
we are headed back toward the sun
the officers give a slightly ragged cheer
in anticipation of which
i asked killick to prepare something special
shouts off killick
killick comes in with his usual exasperated expression bearing a tray with a silver tureen lid on it
which i was just coming
he lays it on the table
gentlemen i give you
he whips off the lid to reveal a strange glutinous mass a pudding cut in the oddest of shapes
everyone stands to get a better look
the galapagos islands
pon my word so it is
look heres narborough chatham and hood
thats where the whalers are aint it mr allen
so thats where the acheron will be headed
the mood is now taken over by the glee of recognition as the officers marvel over the pudding
pullings if youll permit me a slice of albermale
for you doctor redondo rock
theres a tiny man of war made of icing between the islands
jack picks it up in his spoon
and with a fair wind behind us the acheron for me
slow pan over a glassy expanse of water
jacks head suddenly breaks the surface close to camera
as he swims he brings the surprise into view
the ship is utterly becalmed wallowing in the swell her sails hanging limp
a painted ship upon a painted ocean
jack swims around the ship which currently presents a less than warlike picture with washing hanging from every part of the rigging
he calls up to pullings best bowers chipped
lot of rust on these forechains
black strake needs another coat
jack comes aboard takes a towel from killick and looks about him
the men are holystoning the deck and polishing the brightwork
they look thin and exhausted and burnt dark brown by the sun and wind
killick is with nagel and others tarring the ratlines as he looks back at hollom patrolling the gangway
killick indicates him with a tilt of the head
that engagement off recife his whole gun crew killed and him not a mark on him
soon as he went up the mizzen mast warley falls
and whose watch was it when we lost our wind
hollom sees them looking at him
a marine sentry trollope stands guard by the ships water barrel the level is very low
stephen ladles some water into a phial
one glass per man sir captains orders
stephen straightening irritated by the challenge
a mere thimbleful corporal for scientific purposes only
in the gloom of his cabin stephen angles the mirror of his brass microscope toward the window and places a slide containing a droplet of water under the lens
jack climbs into the top
he adjusts his telescope studies the horizon
he pans across the empty sea
an assortment of mobile transparent micro organisms rotating wildly
my god padeen a veritable zoo
padeen takes a look amazed then greatly amused
charts are spread all over the table stephen poring over them when jack comes in show me where these doldrums lie
jack joins him
will we never make a sailor of you
the doldrums is a condition not a region
but you tend to strike em here
pointing between the trades and the soueasterlies
i hope the acheron is having it as bad as we are
stephen considers their current position on the chart the tiny galapagos islands to the north and the vast emptiness to the west of them
assuming he is heading for the galapagos and not some other point in all this vastness
id have thought youd be delighted to go there
it is said to be a natural paradise in truth id be delighted with the merest guano stained rock provided it didnt sway beneath my feet well well take on
food and water once were there and as compensation for not having put ashore in brazil i pledge that during that time several days at least you can wander at will catching bugs and beetles to your hearts delight
you will be the first naturalist to set foot on the islands
that is my solemn promise i accept provided the men have not mutinied and thrown us all overboard before we get there
they are already counting their share of the prize money
another week of this and they shall gladly give it up for a glass of clean water
pray stop your bellyacheing
we shall have rain presently and if not we shall damned well tow ourselves out of this
disgruntled under slept men in boats towing the ship
nagel and davies look back darkly at hollom who sits in the stern
davies whispers i heard he were on the fair marion as foundered off tresco
and he were on the zephyrus what exploded at trafalgar
hollom has heard this as davies intended but he looks away choosing to ignore them
a view from above of men towing the ship
over this an unpleasant scraping sound chalk on slate
m a s t
mast stephen is writing words on a slate then offering them to bonden whom he is teaching to read
s u n
sun stephen nods and scratches another word on the board
as bonden struggles to decipher it theres the sound of a musket shot and a seabird falls out of the sky
howard the captain of marines reloads his smoking musket laughing aloud
is that man completely mad
shouts down mr
howard a petrel is not good eating
howard looks up towards them a broad smile on his red moon of a face
were you never a man for sporting doctor
why you could shoot all day in these waters with two men loading
the midshipmen and powder monkeys have assembled for weapons practise armed with cutlasses
calamy and williamson divide the group into two teams choosing sides as for school yard football
the final choice all right come on addison
little addison joins calamys side trailing his too large sword
williamson tosses a coin
calamys side retire to a defensive position made of tar barrels at one end of the deck
from here they are suddenly aware of jack idly watching their mock fight from the quarter deck williamsons team give a yell and charge at them
its serious fighting
heads are struck fingers are rapped
blakeney trying gamely with his left arm but frustrated by his own ineptitude goes down under the rush of attackers
ow ow ow
let go of him
calamy cant drag the bigger boy off
he whips a pistol out of his belt and fires it at williamsons head
williamson is blasted sideways clutching his face and yelling in pain
the other boys separate horrified
its just powder
there wasnt a ball in it just powder
he helps blakeney to his feet
are you all right
angrily shaking free of him he looks to where jack stood but the captain is no longer watching
i saved you
i didnt need to be saved
tar bubbling under the heat of the sun
cannons fizzing and steaming as they are washed
theres been a change of crews in the long boats and hollom and his men are now back on board
nagel is approaching from one end of the narrow gang way hollom from the other
nagel pushes past deliberately bumping hollom who stumbles clutching for the gunwale
jack sees this outrageous act of indiscipline and yells out master at arms
take that man below and clap him in irons
pullings defaulters at six bells
jack stands behind his desk brow like thunder
from outside the sounds of the muster
hollom stands in front of him twisting his hat between his hands
the man pushed past you without making his obedience
and yet you said nothing
no sir i intended to but the right words just didnt
the right words
he failed to salute you
its deliberate insubordination
hollom looks at the floor mumbles they dont like me sir
speak up man
hollom raises his head and looks at jack his eyes shiny with tears and when he opens his mouth the words tumble out in a rush
ive tried to get to know the men a bit sir be friendly like but theyve taken a set against me
always whispering when i go past giving me looks
but ill set that to rights be tougher on them from now on
you cant make friends with the foremast jacks theyll despise you in the end
nor do you need be a tyrant
its leadership they want strength respect
im very sorry sir
youre what twenty three twenty four
smiling weakly twenty five next friday
youve failed to pass for lieutenant twice
you cant spend the rest of your life as a midshipman
ill try harder sir
killick helps jack on with his full dress uniform
well its an unfortunate business hollom
killick seems to endorse this by placing the captains hat emphatically on jacks head
jack turns and strides out of the cabin hollom following slowly after him
the entire crew has been mustered
the uniformed officers line the quarterdeck as jack reads from the articles of war
article thirty six
all other crimes not capital committed by any person or persons in the fleet
shall be punished according to the laws and customs of the sea
then to nagel mr
nagel youre an old man of wars man and yet you failed to salute an officer
you knew what you were doing
have you anything to say in your defence
nagel looks at the deck
have his officers anything to say for him
davies and killick scowl across the deck at hollom who looks wretched but says nothing
seize him up
nagel is spread eagled to the grating his hands tied
seized up sir
bosuns mate do your duty
the mate takes the leather cat o nine tails out of its red bag
jack stands alone tuning his fiddle
no matter how much he turns the peg the top string always sounds flat
he tunes some more and breaks it
and bloody death
every word is plainly audible to the men on watch who pretend to hear nothing
jack is fitting a new string
widen to reveal stephen sitting opposite with his cello
i was merely remarking that you have always prided yourself on not being a flogging captain and this
i am not a flogging captain
i have not once rigged the grating on this voyage not once in twelve thousand miles
besides i wager you will find a deal more brutality on land
tightening the new string
the note escalating as he turns
im not a party to it on land
well you are party to it on my ship
men must be governed
often not wisely i grant you but there are hierarchies even in nature as youve often said yourself
that is the excuse of every tyrant in history
trying to call a halt yes
fine words im sure continues regardless we are not animals and i for one am opposed to authority that egg of misery and oppression
very fine words stephen but in these current circumstances hard work and firm discipline is what keeps our little wooden world together
and grog i suppose
what of it
of course they have their grog
stephen sits contd you know nagel was drunk when he insulted hollom
and higgins is never sober
even the midshipmen
the men will have their grog stephen
it is part of the immemorial tradition of the service well a shameful tradition it is too
to have them pressed from their homes kept in a permanent state of dull inebriation
confined for months in a wooden prison never more than a few hours sleep and flogged when drunken idleness drives them to
jack forcefully stephen
i warn you that friend or no i will not have you talk of the service like that
i am stating plain facts finally explodes well i will not hear them
from you or anyone
things are as they are for good or bad whether or not they have a place in your damned papist philosophy
if you are here to make music then sit down and play
if not be gone for you have come to the wrong shop for anarchy
in stony silence stephen puts down his cello bow and leaves past killick who is lurking as always by the door
something disturbs the dark surface of the water as hollom dips the ladle and fills his cup
a sense of someone moving up behind him
hollom turns abruptly
its the marine sentry moving in the shadows
he stares at hollom as he backs away toward the ladder and hurries below
to reach his quarters he is obliged to walk the length of the berth deck past howard obsessively cleaning his pistol another man whittling with a knife davies adding another
link in the tattooed chain about becketts middle
no one speaks as hollom runs the gauntlet of their stares acutely aware of his own breathing
it now seems universally to be held that he is the author of all the ships misfortune
nagle pointedly turns his back the scars from the flogging gleaming wetly in the lamplight holloms breath quickens
he stumbles on someones dunnage almost trips but is caught before he falls
its one of nagels mates
nagels mate careful sir
hollom comes in wild eyed and goes to his berth breathing hard
calamy blakeney boyle look up from a tense game of cards
are you all right hollom
hollom shakes his head miserably hyperventilating
hes not sick
hes just dodging work
blakeney angrily oh shut up calamay
what do you know about anything
calamy glares at blakeney
a shot from the deck above
stephen looks up from his book di consolazione philosophae
then the sound of bare feet approaching followed by a knock at the door
its joe plaice looking agitated
beg your pardon your honour but mr
howard just shot a sea monster
stephen and plaice stride along to where the marine captain howard peers down into the water with one of his men
the very man
stephen moves to the rail looks out
i wished youd seen it for yourself doctor
the crew never seen anything like it
on the glassy sea a smudge of blood and some ripples it was prodigious like a human though bigger might have been a sea elephant it had a calf with
it i didnt mean to hit the calf i missed my mark
howard let me beg you if the men cant eat it or i cant dissect it please do not shoot every creature you see
stephen stares back down at the ripples spreading over the glassy sea
wide on the troubled ship small yellow patches of light visible from the gun ports
the men are lying in their hammocks when from somewhere outside there comes an ungodly howling
it stops then comes again exactly human in its pitch
the crew look at one another
this is like no sound theyve ever heard
the howling stops then comes again from another direction
killick and black billy listening
what did i tell you
the ships accursed
jack comes up from below
what is that abominable noise for gods sake
i have no idea sir
you dont think its the acheron sir
untypically cutting the enemy cannot come on us without a wind mr
he looks about at the terrified faces of the crew
the wailing sound now rises to a shriek as stephen joins the group
what do you make of it doctor
im sure ive never heard the like
the crew overhear this and pass it among themselves as another anguished howl fills the night
perhaps its the mother of the creature mr
a sea elephant possibly
though i have never known one with a cry like this
a glance along at howard on the gangway as terrified as anyone
fire off some flares
three flares soar and burst with a ghostly glow making a pool of blue light around the ship the sound continuing to echo and re echo from somewhere beyond
the light illuminates the half hour glass its top half empty of sand
like everyone else the duty sergeant stands frozen to the spot
jack rounds on him
sergeant what the devil are you thinking of
turn the glass and strike the bell
roused the duty sergeant turns the glass and time resumes its flow
two bells are hesitantly rung and the crew regain the power of motion their limbs still spastic with fear
and when the sound comes once more they all freeze
jack joins mowett at the taffrail
the thing is somewhere out there whatever it is
perhaps some poor shipwreck
he shouts a slight nervous catch to his voice
is anyone there
part of him knows its crazy and of course theres no reply
the sound constantly shifting position now in the water now in the sky
jack turns to see a white face frighteningly close to his own
its padeen mouth agape face unnaturally white staring into the gloom as though drawn to whatever horror lies out there
what are you doing on the quarterdeck
he looks down at the press of men who have gathered at the bottom of the ladder some with weapons
all of you men below
to mowett tell the bosun those off duty may sleep with their lamps on
several crewmen huddle close together their faces lit by a battle lantern
joe plaice grim
doudle wide eyed
higgins with his alcoholic tremor more pronounced than ever
duppies make that noise
killick indicating bill see
they know all about this in africa
whats a duppie
swallow by a fish
spirit cant get out
him duppie now
captain dont even know what that noise be
general nods of agreement
doctor neither and he knows everything
joe heres got the most experience in these matters and new brains to boot lets hear it from joe
all eyes on joe plaice
he speaks from the shadows
its the jonah causing it
that howling thing is a signal to the phantom ship
hes calling it up dont you see
every time hes on watch the ship appears
you wait and see the ghost ship will appear any time tonight and take us all straight to the hot place
another shriek closer now seems to confirm joes bizarre theory
the boys sit together
none of them look at hollom who sits pale and wretched in a corner of the room clutching his stomach
as the howling continues stephen looks through a number of books on sea creatures searching for a reference to what theyre experiencing
as jack looks over his shoulder his eye is caught by a picture in one of stephens books
he picks it up
close on the picture its an engraving of a giant squid its tentacles wrapped around a ship
back on jack holding the picture up to stephen
you dont think
there is a knock on the cabin door and blakeney enters agitated
blakeney to stephen its mr
hollom sir you better come quick
hollom writhing in agony on the floor stephen trying to calm him shouting for assistance from the midshipmen and then from padeen
try to contain yourself
hold his head
padeen stephen is writing some case notes in his journal when jack puts his head around the door
stephens pov the lamp lighting his face from below and to one side gives a strange lopsided twist to jacks smile well
theres nothing physically wrong with him
he thinks hes been cursed by the men
then he probably has been
sailors will abide a great deal but never a jonah
its like a white crow the others peck it to death
my god you believe it too
i desired to save you the trouble of looking for a cure
no doubt it will all be sorted by the morning
blakeney stands near the bows peering out into the night
a figure approaches from behind and lays a hand in his shoulder
blakeney nearly jumps out of his skin
you gave me such a start
are you better now
holloms breathing does indeed seem easier
much better thank you
i think the creature is going away
i am sure of it
he reaches down picks up a pound cannonball
youve always been very kind to me
with a sudden movement hes on the gunwale then he jumps over the side the cannonball in his arms
blakeney looks down with shock to see holloms pale face receding from him into the depths
its a moment before he gathers his wits to shout man overboard
the ships company are mustered on deck
jack stands at the sword rack lectern
killick hands him a bible open at the story of jonah
jack looks then hands it back to killick
the fact is not all of us become the men we once hoped we might be
but we are all gods creatures
if some of us thought ill of mr
hollom or spoke ill of him or failed him in respect of fellowship then we ask your forgiveness lord and we ask for his
close on the faces of the crew killick higgins nagel calamy blakeney and finally stephen who is staring oddly at jack as though holding him partly responsible for this latest
crew mumble ashamedly amen
the men on deck remain standing heads bowed observing a minutes silence as the sky begins to pale and the white disc of the sun appears above them
faster doudle is the first to look up followed by others the terrible sound has gone and a small puff of wind is stirring the mainsail
the sand runs out of the half hour glass
strike eight bells
quartermaster to the marine sentry turn the glass and strike the bell
the glass is inverted
the bell tolls
the ship moves through a tropical squall
men rig a sail to catch the water others appear with barrels and tubs anything to catch the precious rain
sea birds swarming over a shoal of fish in the foreground as the cry of the distant lookout carries faintly across the sea
blakeney runs along the gangway past stephen en route to the quarterdeck
give you joy sir
we have raised the galapagos
montage of telescope views galapagos day theres a primeval quality to the landscape a feeling of a world just born
the wild creatures that inhabit the lava flows and coral beaches confirm this the giant tortoises iguanas sea lions and penguins a teeming profusion of exotic animals and plants
the ship fairly bristles with telescopes
a small group of familiar faces share a pocket telescope
higgins looking cant see any wimmun
just lots of ducks and lizards
doudle takes the telescope
there must be wimmun
stephen and blakeney side by side
from both their faces we sense their wonder at seeing these remarkable creatures for the first time
hes looking at a group of unremarkable black seabirds waddling about on a rock flapping short stumpy wings
a species of cormorant
but apparently flightless by all thats holy
i believe that is unknown to science
blakeney dwells briefly on the strange rock climbing birds then drifts back to the iguanas
the dragons dont seem to bother em
they are a type of iguana i should think and therefore vegetarian
his telescope remains focussed on the cormorants
blakeney is wholly absorbed in the iguanas
will you catch one
and if we can some eggs
i mean the great lizards
recognizing how superficially dull the birds are to blakeneys untutored eye by contrast with giant lizards
i should think a pair of them
then you can present one of their offspring to the king
theres one going for a swim
iguanas are land animals
not these ones
the prehistoric looking creatures as if suddenly awakened begin diving into the water
by jove bonden you are right
two new species in as many minutes
he breaks off suddenly aware of a shouted exchange between the lookout and the quarterdeck
what is all that confounded bellowing
all hands about ship
blakeney dashes off and stephen is elbowed out of the way by hands rushing to get at the sails
by your leave sir by your leave
hollar distant helms alee off tacks and sheets mainsail haul
as the ship turns a distant whaleboat appears with six men aboard pulling out from one of the neighboring islands
the whaleboat has come alongside
men swarm down the boarding nets and the whalers are helped aboard hoarse and exhausted from rowing and shouting
god bless you
thank you shipmates
hogg the senior whaler sits with his mates relating his story to jack and the officers
we was coming back for fresh lines hid in that inlet yonder
black three master
bit beamy and raised in the stern
meaningful looks among jack and his men
its definitely the acheron hes describing hogg meanwhile takes a pint mug of water gulps it down and passes it back to blakeney for a refill
hundred thousand pound of good whale oil they stole
then the bastards
cuffs him no swearing on the quarterdeck
waves allen away go on
then they burnt our bloody ship and headed off bunch of fugging pirates
looking pointedly at allen and her course
maybe a point south of west
following the rest of the whaling fleet
jack rising mr
mowett these men to be entered on the ships books
allen lay a course west souwest
as allen hurries away shouting orders should we not take on fresh supplies sir
jack overlapping impatient theres not a moment to lose mr
he leaves the quarterdeck and goes below stephen following
jack has taken his jacket off and is already unfurling his charts
stephen hurries in
have you forgotten your promise
not looking up subject to the requirements of the service stephen
i could not in all conscience delay for the sake of an iguano or a
giant peccary interesting no doubt but of no immediate application
stephen overlap how can you dismiss out of hand the bounty of nature
that will help to progress
jack overlap i can see nothing on shore that will progress our mission
stephen overlap but how can we possibly know what lies on these islands perhaps some knowledge that may save life that
jack overlap i will tell you how to save lives stephen
inform me how to guide this ship undetected under the nose of a gun frigate
that is the job in hand sir
stephen swallows his indignation and tries for a compromise
well perhaps theres an opportunity to serve both our objectives
as i understand it you mean to go round the end of this long island then start your voyage
i could walk across it be on the other side long before
jack shakes his head
i would walk briskly pausing only for important measurements and almost certainly making valuable discoveries
jack interrupts if wind and tide had been against us i should have said yes
they are not and i am obliged to say no
with finality no
stephen is livid
so after all this time in your service i must simply be content to form part of this belligerent expedition hurry past inestimable wonders bent solely on destruction
you forget yourself sir
no jack you have forgotten your self
you once believed in the rights of each individual man no matter how useless or lowly
but it seems to me now that the long exercise of power has brought you to the point where even a solemn promise
the promise was conditional
a promise to a friend of ten years standing who has stood by you and supported you
jack overlapping i command a kings ship not a private yacht
across half the worlds oceans often at risk to his own life and we have no time for your damned hobbies sir
so that is jacks honest view of stephens lifetime of work in science
he bows slightly then leaves
stephen stands alone at the taffrail watching as the islands recede in the distance
news of the violent argument has spread and there is many a sympathetic glance which further humiliates stephen
blakeney approaches him carrying something carefully in the palm of his hand
sir i found a curious beetle walking on the deck
he opens his hand close on a very plain little brown beetle
i think its a galapagos beetle sir
im sure of it
were you to have walked all day on the island you might never have come across it
that is more than likely sure
blakeney passes it to stephen
you can have it
thank you mr
blakeney hovers for a moment unsure of further conversation then retreats
jack sits alone at the table
killick enters with toasted cheese for two
thats a shame he sets down the toasted cheese
ill just leave the one plate then if himself wont be joining
just the one
jack cuts himself a portion scowling at stephens cello which seems to watch him reproachfully as he eats
stephen takes a dropper carefully measures twenty drops of laudanum to a glass of water and drinks
the lookout leaning out from the cross trees
doudle shouting on deck there
object fine on the starboard bow
a barrel is being lifted aboard from the skiff and passed up the side of the ship
jack comes down accompanied by allen the acknowledged expert in these matters
others gather round including hogg the whaler inspecting the stencilled markings
no this heres from boston
i was married there once
any road its a yankee barrel
what they call a bedford hog in new england
mowett to jack the acheron touched at boston
and its not been in the water more than a week
one cant say with any accuracy but
yes you can
theres no sea chummer on it and the dowels is sound
jack returns to his post
continue due west mr
tom pullings watches him
there has been a change amongst the officers and crew toward jack
his relentless driving after the acheron has reached the point of obsession an obsession not shared by his exhausted men
he is a lonely haunted figure as he now steps up on the gunwale one hand on the ratlines scanning the empty sea sensing his enemy is out there just
beyond the curve of the earth
a wild wind humming through the rigging as stephen goes topside
he finds various hands making the boats secure
have you seen the bird doctor
i have not no bird these many days
what kind of a bird
a sort of albatross i believe or perhaps a prodigious great mew
he has been following the ship since
there he is crossing our wake
stephen runs along the gangway to get a clearer view checking himself when he sees jack on the quarterdeck
their eyes meet
the quarterdeck is jacks domain now and stephen avoids it
then behind jack the great bird suddenly appears
its huge with at least a fourteen foot wing span and flying very close to the ship drifting and soaring on the gusting wind appearing and disappearing between the sails
stephen is mesmerized by it
he lets go of the rail leaning forward to get a better view
at the same time across from stephen on the opposite gangway howard and two or three marines open fire on the bird
the bird drops low flying right by stephen
again a crackle of gunfire but the bird is apparently uninjured and it banks away skimming the surface of the water
stephen sags to the deck
blood spreading across the white of his shirt
howard there by his side
my god man
im so sorry
the bird dropped low
i didnt see you there
jack is there shouting calamy
then turning to bonden padeen davies carry the doctor below
stephen gets slowly up hands reaching to help him howard in the background distraught explaining to anyone wholl listen what happened
its all right i am quite capable of walking
he tries to stand crumples
stephens cabin day higgins presses clumsily around the wound as stephen lies on the bed his abdomen rigid his breathing laboured
jack watches from the door
you will just make it worse
by prodding mr
higgins it cannot be got at
except by opening me up
a violent pitching of the ship makes it obvious how impossible this will be under sail
as stephen lapses into unconsciousness higgins looking alarmed approaches jack
higgins a whisper the bullet took a piece of shirt in with it
unless it is removed it will suppurate and fester
are you equal to the task
ill need to read up on the doctors books like
study some pictures he has get my bearings
be better on land but ill manage somehow
jack looks away from the alcoholic higgins back to stephen
jack passes an anxious crowd of the ships company blakeney joe plaice killick and howard
you men get about your business
there are dark looks in jacks direction as he retreats to his cabin
jack throws a chart on the table
with his protractor he marches out great strides west into the pacific from the galapagos islands and marks the ships position they are maybe a hundred miles from the galapagos
ahead open sea until the marquesas
lying on his bed in some pain stephen hears thudding feet shouted orders
in his weakened state the sounds tend to merge
his pitching cabin keeps swimming out of focus
theres a knock on the door and jemmy ducks appears with a mug of soup and some biscuit
sail on the horizon sir
hull down running west
it may be a couple of days before we can catch her
stephen nods all he wants is quiet
jemmy ducks retreats as stephen swigs from a little bottle of laudanum which for a moment brings peace effectively blocking out the noise from above
a smile to padeen like a farewell and he closes his eyes
jack telescope to his eye studies the distant ship as pullings jumps down from the ratlines to the deck
it might be the acheron
if we put on more sail wed come up with her before nightfall
jack lowers the telescope turns his back on pullings strangely abstracted
to his back do you wish me to set the topgallants
no reply sir
a long silence
then jack walks away
pullings stares perplexed from jacks retreating figure to the distant chase
early morning light on the interior of the cabin
padeen is asleep holding a bible in the doctors chair
stephen himself lies motionless with his eyes closed and his mouth open no colour in his face
the sea is relatively calm
from outside the sound of the bosuns orders over rattling blocks and pulleys
clap on now
every rope an end
jolly boat away
you grass combing lubber
mowett comes in sees stephen and takes him for dead
shouts outside davies
two big men come in behind him
padeen wakes confused and pushes them away moving protectively to the doctors side
the commotion disturbs stephen
his eyes open
like a dead man just come back to life
youre still with us
can we move you onto a stretcher
stephen swallows uncomfortably and tries to make sense of things
a giant iguana watches as a small procession trudges up the stony beach
at its head stephen is carried in a litter up to where a tent has been set up above the high water mark
as jack appears in the blue sky above him
tell me this wasnt on my account
dead pan no
it was because of higgins
beat cant have him poking around in your belly without a solid platform to work on
he ducks as they enter in the creamy light they lay stephen down on a recently constructed wooden operating table
higgins squats on the ground rummaging through various large sharp surgical instruments which he has emptied onto a piece of hessian
all set higgins
stephen grabs jacks sleeve
i do this with my own hand
jack frowns unsure what he means by this
padeen stands arms crossed at the closed tent flap keeping at bay a crowd of well wishers and the merely curious
stephen sits pale and sweaty propped up on a series of chests his back against a coil of rope
in front of him suspended by pulleys lamb and nagel have set up a large gilt framed mirror
beside him on a white tablecloth some small scissors and scalpels
to jack you are sure you have a head and a stomach for this kind of thing
jack smiles my dear doctor i have seen blood and wounds since i was a little boy
then hold my belly pressing firmly when i give the word
stephen begins first with the knife then the probe the grind of metal on living bone
you will have to raise the rib higgins
take a good grip with the square retractor
to himself snip the cartilage
the metallic clash of instruments perpetual swabbing
now jack a steady downward pressure
keep it so
give me the davier
press jack press
jack closes his eyes
stephen draws in his breath arches his back and its done
there she is
he pulls out the bullet and with it a fragment of his shirt
is that all of it
the bloody piece of shirt is handed to higgins who matches it to the hole in stephens old shirt
aye shell patch up nicely sir
easy away jack
handsomely with the retractor
higgins look to the captain while i swab
higgins helps jack into a chair pressing his head down between his knees
after a moment and a few deep breaths jack looks up
stephen smiles at him
a hint of surly triumph
through a gap in the door of his tent stephen can see the distant ship at anchor
repairs are underway guns being unloaded stores and fresh water being ferried aboard
blakeney comes in followed by padeen with a some numbered boxes hung round his neck
my goodness what is this
blakeney starts rolling up the sides of the tent as padeen unloads his boxes each with a beetle and a piece of vegetation in it
well sir padeen and i have been doing some collecting for you
the beetles each come with a specimen of plant they were found on
catch him padeen
there he goes
he finishes rolling up the tent sides to reveal a collection of cages with native wildfowl in them being fed by the poulterer jemmy ducks
the birds were snared by jemmy ducks
captain says we can keep them in the chicken coop
then producing a notebook and i made a few notes if you want to see them
stephen flips the pages no
large square black beetle with pincers
found under rock
pon my word you have the makings of a true naturalist
blakeney is flattered but unsure
well sir perhaps i could combine them and be a kind of fighting naturalist like yourself
stephen smiles at this description as he levers himself into a sitting position
shall we take a tour of your aviary
blakeney looks doubtfully at the doctors bandaged abdomen
should you really be up
padeen puts the escaped beetle in his mouth for safe keeping and offers stephen a hand
stephen pulls himself painfully to his feet and starts buttoning his shirt
to blakeney how long does the captain intend that we stay here do you know
jack is watching those of the crew not on duty play cricket on the shore with a canvas ball and stumps made of driftwood
oh a week perhaps
there is no great hurry
but surely we must make haste for the marquesas
it may not have been the acheron that we sighted
nor can we be sure of her destination
looks away no i think we shall go home now before peace breaks out with france god forbid
hes making light of what has been a huge and far reaching decision
but how will it sit with the admiralty
to have spent six months in a fruitless pursuit and then come home empty handed
not a bit of it
what about these plants and animals which blakeney has been collecting
the british museum will need an entire new wing for em
stephen regards him gravely shaking his head
i fear jack you have burdened me with a debt i can never repay
he is absolutely sincere about this to jacks great embarrassment
name a shrub after me
something prickly and hard to eradicate
i shall name a giant tortoise testudo aubreii
stephen blakeney and padeen leave the camp on stephens first day of exploration
they are armed with nets baskets and a days supply of food and water
stephen walks slightly stooped leaning on a walking stick
a strange and wonderful landscape lies before them with its organically shaped lava flows and alien looking flora and fauna
everywhere stephen looks there are creatures unique to the islands
he is in his element collecting specimens which padeen carefully stores in the baskets
blakeney has his telescope trained on some distant humps
doctor would you think it very unscientific of me to ride on the back of one of those tortoises
i would think it an experiment of absolutely vital importance
but afterwards i do desire to find that flightless cormorant assuming that is what it is and that i still have strength enough to catch it
blakeney gets astride a giant tortoise and burns his bottom on its scorching hot shell
stephen with his telescope taking notes on bird life
the huge strangely balletic figure of padeen chasing after a butterfly in evening light
wide to see another aspect of the countryside a hint of distant sea a rocky headland rising from the plain
the group is widely scattered
stephen at the base of the headland blakeney half a mile further inland
padeen coming up slowly behind laden with the fruits of their expedition
stephen rests a moment
some stones rattle down from the hillside
he looks up to see a flash of black feathers near the crest the cormorant
on his shirt a red smudge has appeared
his wound has begun to bleed again
ignoring this stephen pushes on after his quarry
near the top stephen pauses to catch his breath and glances above him
again the bird moving higher as if leading him on
stephen gets down on all fours crawling cautiously to the crest just above him
there is movement in the bushes
stephen slowly rises climbs the few paces to the hilltop and enters a clearing
he searches amongst the bushes
he turns and looks back down the hillside to see blakeney and padeen far below then sits to get his breath back again
v on the ground between his feet a beetle
he picks it up
close on his hand
it is the same type of beetle blakeney gave him aboard the surprise
smiling at the coincidence stephen raises the tiny creature to eye level
the beetle the creature in sharp focus behind it the sea and on the sea a black shape
the focus shifts to the background a ship at anchor in a bay
the beetle flies away as stephen stares out at the ship
its the acheron and they are weighing anchor
blakeney urging stephen to hurry as they make their way through the darkening landscape
all kinds of creatures are appearing around them and every few yards stephen pauses to examine something
sir you must hurry
youre a worse tyrant than any ships captain
hes breathing hard exhausted
you must carry him padeen
padeen looks at the collection of baskets he carries
we must get back to the ship
stephen raises his hand in protest but blakeney is already divesting padeen of his load
padeen carrying stephen piggy back blakeney out ahead urging them on
a the discarded collecting boxes a variety of small bugs and animals crawling free stephen gingerly lowers himself into his elbow chair gripping the table and blakeneys good arm for
sighing he begins emptying his pockets of various small items collected during the day some leaves rocks and insects and places them in ordered piles around his microscope
all about them can be heard the urgent sounds of departure the anchor rattling up shouted orders and the drumming of bare feet on the deck above
he holds up a stick in a specimen jar and is examining it with his magnifying glass when jack enters
i forgot to ask you did you see your bird
stephens eye grossly enlarged through the lens
i did not
my greatest discovery was your phantom
indeed it was im sorry
waving the magnifying glass not a bit of it
william and i made a unique discovery
handing jack the jar and magnifying glass
tell him mr
blakeney beaming its a rare phasmid sir
jack inspects the stick
it winks at him
its an insect disguised as a stick
jack stares at the creature
in order to confuse a predator
jack looks up at stephen
the surprise alive with crewmen on the deck and in the rigging
shouts and commands drift across the water as she turns and heads out from the bay
a gangway same time jack strides along the quarterdeck towards the forecastle issuing a stream of orders mr
hollar rouse up all the yellow paint we have
i want six men with brushes slung over the side
moving on doudle
jack hands him a piece of paper with a sketch on it
get your sail makers working on this
sixty yards by five yards with an eyelet every seven feet
he shouts to hogg who with a few men is manhandling a large metal cauldron from the ballast to the gun deck
to hogg have nagel patch it up and light a fire in it
once were underway replace some of the sails with the oldest most patched set we have
theyll be in the afterhold sir
ill need some men to move all the clutter
spread it around the foredeck
the more mess the better
the ship powers ahead as men swing in harnesses above the racing water painting out the nelson chequer
nagel positions the great cauldron amidships as men come up from below with old barrels and bits of rope
on the gangway men under calamys instructions haul on ropes pulling up the old patched sails
the sails lead us up to jack pullings and the whaler hogg scan the dark horizon
a mainmast toplight
jack has to use a telescope
youve got good eyes hogg
shouts down to the helm mr
bonden set a course west south west
to pullings well drop below the horizon and come up on the other side of him let him think hes seen us first
first light reveals the results of an overnight transformation from a naval warship to a shambolic looking portuguese whaler
the gunwales are painted an untidy ochre and the gun ports hidden behind broad strips of canvas
the sails are patched and ragged the forecastle cluttered with barrels
smoke billows from a cauldron amidships
on deck and in the rigging theres a quarter of the normal complement of men all of them dressed in pursers slops
a bemused stephen looks about him as he approaches jack
a wolf in sheep in sheeps clothing a phasmid doctor
it was you what gave me the idea
im not sure a phasmid can be a predator
well this one is
howard and his marines change out of their smart uniforms into the oldest most ragged clothes on board the ship much to the amusement of the passing sailors
blue to match your eyes
is there a skirt comes with it
men are checking the breechings of the great guns and chipping cannonballs to make them more perfectly spherical more deadly
the armourer is at his grindstone sending out showers of sparks a group of seamen round him relaying one another at the crank stacking newly honed cutlasses and boarding axes
at their feet
another team check and load pistols by the score
alone blakeney awkwardly draws his dirk left handed from its scabbard
it glints momentarily in the lamp light
calamy enters face aglow abruptly trying to cover his joy when he sees blakeney
its all right
permission to boast
youre to lead the boarders from the forecastle
youll make lieutenant out of this
the others come in
he already has
acting rd lieutenant peter calamy
oohs and aahs from all
then ill see you at the forecastle lieutenant
thats not your station
blakeney looks from calamy to the others who avoid his eye
but naturally ill board with you
im sorry will
blakeney is devastated
rye bursts in in a state of high excitement
shes seen us
jack raises his glass focuses on the acheron plainly visible in the distance with a line of signal flags running up her backstay
shes asking us to heave to
shall i give the order
no make a show of fleeing upwind but panicky and disorganized like a whaler might do
allen smiles at this unintended slight no offence mr
a show of chaos on deck as the surprise veers upwind away from the acheron
as she presents her stern we see her new name malacca
through his telescope jack looks back at the acheron in pursuit a dark figure on her foredeck
to mowett run up portuguese colours
then down to the gun deck load mr
triple shot em
blakeney comes onto the quarterdeck and salutes looking flushed and angry
may i speak with you sir
no saluting mr
blakeney were whalers here
calamy says i am not in the boarding party i wanted to say interrupts i know what you want to say and my answer is no
i promised your mother i would return you in one piece and i have already failed her on that score
you will command a gun and then retire to defend the quarterdeck here with dr
but sir jack cutting in go to your station mr
blakeney begins to salute doesnt and retires tears burning his eyes
a moment later theres a flash of orange astern as the acheron opens up with her bow chasers
an pound shot screams past the side of the surprise to land with a column of spray just off their bows
remind me to press her bow gunner mr
the second ball takes down some rigging
start the water and throw some barrels overboard
he goes below
barrels go overboard and pumps spout streams of water over the side as jack runs down to the great majority of men are gathered here more than a hundred of
them crammed together with their muskets and sabres listening to the odd thump from topsides as another ball from the acheron hits home
calamy and his gang of young tykes are squashed in there somewhere boyle williams addison and the rest eyes shining with nervousness and wild anticipation as jack addresses his men
who shout encouragement ad lib in every pause
plus the men ad lib were a long way from home
right you are captain
a long way from anywhere too true
but if britain rules the waves she rules these waves too
right she does
and the blow we shall deal for his majesty here will be felt just as keenly ill say it will aye and cheered just as loudly specially by the wimmin
as any dealt at trafalgar or cape st
the camera moves over the upturned faces plaice nagel doudle killick the midshipmen the powder monkeys the whole fellowship of the ship
and finally stephen watching jack doing what he does best transmitting his own fearlessness into other men the total warrior the consummate leader
i dont say it will be easy
shes twice the men we have and theyll sell their lives dearly
but every man here is worth three of boneys privateers and i know theres not a faint heart among you
calamy pipes up three cheers for the captain
men deafening huzzah huzzah huzzah
on calamy cheering like a kid at a football match as
another well placed shot from the acheron smashes through the rigging sending down a shower of rope and cordage
jack is back at his station by the wheel the acheron little more than a half a mile astern the figure of the captain in his black coat clearly visible
jack studies the looming black vessel then turns and crosses to bonden at the helm
bonden nods lifting his hands from the wheel as jack grips the curved timber decisively taking the strain
he feels the pulse of the ship through his fingers looks up to the sails then back to the acheron
stephen appears beside him casually smoking a cigar
he offers one to jack who declines another shot pierces the mizzen foresail above them but neither man flinches
killick appears with two cups of coffee and in his belt a brace of pistols
i took the liberty doctor
thank you killick
jack steers one handed as he sips his coffee
a poem might be in order
another shot through the sails
a poem sir
after a moments reflection oh were it mine with sacred maros art to wake to sympathy the feeling heart a ball goes howling past the ship mowett winces
then might i with unrivalled strains deplore thimpervious horrors of a leeward shore
jack smiles nods
transfixed with terror at thapproaching doom
apologetic they were only people of the merchant service of course sir
shes now less than five hundred yards from their stern and gaining
jack turns back to mowett
we have her mr
strike the portuguese colours and run up the jack
canvas off the gun ports and run em out
marines away aloft
the british jack rises to the masthead replacing the portuguese colours as pullings descends to the gun deck
the black muzzles appear with a low rumbling sound as jack with a wink to mowett yells at the top of his voice helms a lee
and spins the wheel hard to starboard
wide to see her swinging broadside on across the path of the oncoming acheron
confused shouts from the enemys deck chaos on her forecastle somewhere a drum beating
jack hands the wheel to bonden
run us down her larboard side then cut across her wake
shouts down to the gun deck hold fire mr pullings
hold till were broadside on
wide to see the surprise turning downwind back towards the acheron so they will pass broadside to broadside no more than thirty yards apart
through a furious exchange of musket fire jack runs down the ladder to the gun deck fire as she bears
every gun to concentrate on her mainmast
through the gunports the acherons great hull becomes visible
some of the acherons guns have run out but the crews are unprepared and disorganized
on the uproll
fire for the mainmast as you sight her
as the surprise rolls and the upper deck of the acheron becomes visible
barking leaping back one by one great tongues of flame spitting from their barrels dense clouds of smoke rising
with an almighty splitting sound their mainmast falls dragging yards and rigging with it the whole mass falling over their side obscuring many of their gun ports
cheers from the crew
jack yelling up the companionway now mr bonden
the acheron wallows bought to a standstill by the enormous dragging weight of their mainmast
bonden wheels the ship across the enemys wake past the exposed vulnerable stern
fire at will
in random sequence the surprises gunners pound it into the acherons stern
casement windows vanish in a cloud of wood and glass exposing the acherons terrified gun crews now open to devastating fire as the surprise glides past
jack climbs up on the gunwales shouting to bonden lay me alongside
the bow of the surprise lurches into the acheron mid ships spars interlocking the surprise guns firing into her at point blank range
the crew throw grappling hooks
and he leaps to the enemy deck a great tide of men following after him
calamy leads his own childrens crusade from the bows and forecastle youthful but terrifying screaming and swinging their blades
an agonized blakeney watches from where he stands beside stephen
joe plaice is close by with some of the older men ready to ferry the wounded below
as the surprises pour onto the quarterdeck they face withering fire from the enemy
a dozen men go down some of them fatally wounded
among them are doudle boyle allen and horner in quick succession
the attack momentarily falters and the acherons surge back at them
jack rallies his men and they charge again the marine trollope and nagel are blown backwards by grapeshot
lamb enraged surges past nagels body swinging his axe to devastating effect with hollar by his side and jemmy ducks protecting their rear a pistol in each hand firing from
jack keeps pushing onwards the centre of the milling swirling hacking crowd stabbing and pistolling each other with barely room to fall
the acherons are gradually forced back across their quarterdeck and down into the waist of the ship
jack crosses swords with a man in front of him as an enemy pikeman drives his blade into his left arm tearing through the sleeve
bonden fires a pistol by his ear deafening jack and killing the pikeman
to either side privateers are trying to reach them shouting swearing in english french and spanish
bullets and missiles rain down from above killing friend and foe alike
killick is in the thick of it a pistol in either hand and from his lips a high pitched blood curdling scream
awkward davies is foaming at the mouth as he swings a meat cleaver right and left
a commander of the privateers notes the poorly defended surprise and leads a counter attack over onto her quarterdeck
look to our quarter deck
blakeney dirk in hand turns to face them as does howard and his men but they are gravely outnumbered
calamy sees the danger and leads his gang back onto the surprise calling for others to follow
calamy this way
stephen padeen and joe plaice appear from below
stephen picks up a pistol and with deadly accuracy shoots a privateer lunging at captain howard
the man drops a neat hole in his forehead
a moments astonishment from howard at the doctors surprising skill
calamy fights his way to blakeney who is down on his knees stabbing at the legs of the attackers
jack bonden and davies are driving a wedge toward the stern the defenders falling back in disarray
pullings and mowett fight side by side
a swivel gun mounted on the taff rail is swung to face them
the gunner is about to fire when a perfectly aimed musket ball hits him again fired by stephen
calamy blakeney and their group force the counter attack back onto the deck of the acheron
the two boys fight as a team as they move toward the stern
some acherons jump overboard to escape the furious attack
others are thrown grasping at woodwork as they fall
jemmy ducks turns the swivel on a group of acherons the grapeshot blasting them up against the gunwale
men drown others struggle to stay afloat clinging to the mass of wreckage floating by the hull
cheering from the surprises demands to surrender in many languages some beg for mercy others fight on
jack moves alone down to the berth deck
he smashes the chain off a locked door releasing a dozen or more prisoners
everywhere signs of the lethal blast through the ships stern bodies guns upended shattered timbers
he makes his way through to the great cabin
four privateers look up as jack bursts in
they have been looting their own ships valuables two of them are too drunk to be scared
where is your captain
ou est votre capitaine
one man leaps out through the shattered windows
a couple of others raise their hands and start jabbering in french and spanish
its all over for the acherons as a french officer hauls down their colours
a cheer from the surprises a few last shots fired
calamy and blakeney cheering blakeney holding aloft the captured flag
a dying frenchman suddenly lunges at calamy with a sabre
blakeney steps in front of him and takes the blow
a doctor is working here a callow faced man in a bloody apron red eyed from fatigue
jack enters a fearsome sight with his singed yellow hair and blood stained cutlass
where is he
the doctor points at a body on the operating table
jack approaches looks down at the dead man
hes somewhere about jacks age fine featured with his black coat draped over his body
il mavait prie de vous donner ceci
passing jack the captains sword
jack picks his way through the dead and wounded to where calamy sits nursing blakeney
hes dead sir
gently jack picks up the lifeless body and walks slowly back down the quarterdeck the boy draped across his arms
friend and foe part silently in front of him as he crosses the gangway to
then with calamy following he goes below
jack in wide shot sitting alone on the bench running under the stern windows
his hunched posture and red tear stained eyes give a glimpse of his familiar post battle mood a mix of grief and depression the old question was it worth the
the two ships anchored close together on the ocean
as eight bells are rung for the change of watch we see a row of canvas hammocks each containing the body of a fallen crewman
davies and plaice stitch the bodies into their hammocks blakeney the last body in the line
as the men approach ill do it
joe passes him the needle and twine then they leave him alone
as calamy sews up the hammock hollars voice is heard distinctly from below
rise and shine show a leg there
in close up the peaceful face of blakeney sleepers awake
as calamys hands stitch the canvas closed
the small figures of the crew assembled on the quarterdeck
jacks voice drifting across the water
john henry allen
stephen winston boyle
and lieutenant william blakeney we therefore commit their bodies to the deep looking for the resurrection of the body when the sea shall give up her dead
the bodies in their weighted hammocks slide into the sea
wide on stephen and blakeney as they sit watching two dolphins surfing the bow wave stephen pointing out various features of these magnificent creatures doing his best to take the
boys mind off the loss of his friend
the two ships sail abreast the acheron her shattered masts jury rigged
jack stands with lieutenant mowett and the signals midshipman williamson
they look across at the acheron
parole prisoners valparaiso
you mean lieutenant pullings sir
williamson hurries to the signals locker the signal book and jacks message in his hand
the line of colored signal flags run up to the mast head of the surprise
midshipman rye is reading the signal for pullings then rendezvous portsmouth
god speed captain pullings
a contented smile on pullings face as his promotion is confirmed
he waves across to jack as the acheron makes a sharp turn away from the surprise
slowly the crew come back to life as old familiar habits and routines reassert themselves
acting first lieutenant mowett walks the quarterdeck composing a poem in memory of the battle
joe plaice tells a story of witchcraft and haunted ships to a small attentive audience
while awkward davies works further on the tattoo about becketts waist
the chain begun off brazil now winds its way around most of his torso
blakeney and jemmy ducks are feeding the assorted creatures collected at the galapagos as
bonden reads his first book diseases of seamen by stephen maturin his brow furrowed his lips moving silently
while the powder monkeys skylark in the rigging stephen plays a note on his cello shall we begin
jack pauses gazing into space
jack brother youre gathering wool
jack smiles thinking about their captain
a great seaman whatever you may say of him
the doctor said he was killed by our first broadside
id have liked to talk to him face to face
maybe you did
while i was tending the prisoners they told me their doctor died of fever two weeks ago
there was no doctor on that ship when we boarded it
and i doubt you will find one there now
jack goes very still
a silence broken only by the sound of water flowing gently past the hull
he looks down at the captains sword on the table the thought of a possible final deception flooding through him
he starts to play the deep booming sound of the cello carrying through to
killick wearing an ostentatious bandage about his head is preparing toasted cheese with black bill
thats the last of the cheese and like as not theyll leave it seizing to their plates with their tweedly tweedly tweedly
killick projecting which it will be ready when its ready
in the cabin the violin joins with the cello
rolling undeniable music the music of the waves resonating through the great ship and filling the night
stephens mind is far away
jack breaks off abruptly youre still missing your cormorant
it will still be there when we come back and he breaks into a merry jig wide to see the stern of the ship and a patch of surrounding water
lit by the great stern lantern
through the casement windows the two men can be seen playing
wider to the vast dark sky and the heaving ocean all around with the stern cabin a tiny orange light still faintly visible in the darkness
and further still
until we see the curve of the earth and the planet spinning on its journey through space
