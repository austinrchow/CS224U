third draft the soundtrack opens with frank sinatras fly me to the moon
a helicopter shot of the l
the pool of golden light disintegrates into the thousands of points which constitute it as we rapidly draw closer to the city
we are just above the tops of the highest buildings as we approach hollywood boulevard
below is neon and the icy thrust of search lights rotating on the corner of hollywood and vine
we continue west then quickly north
there is the momentary appearance of the moonlit hollywood sign as we pass the blinking red beacon of the capital records building and drop into franklin avenue and over the
architectural remnants of hollywoods past whip up
we are heading east at treetop level
a warm glow in the distance quickly grows into a modest commercial strip which includes cafes bookstores and a theater
we drop to eye level as we spy through the plate glass showcase window of the bourgeois pig coffeehouse which holds the translucent reflection of the full moon
a cigarette wedged between knuckles smoulders
mike takes the last drag with great effort then crushes it out
he sits in the window sprawled across a red velvet couch that once perfectly complemented a faux spanish foyer
rob sits down next to mike pouring himself some tea
and what if i dont want to give up on her
you dont call
but you said i shouldnt call if i wanted to give up on her
so i dont call either way
so whats the difference
the only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back
see you cant do anything to make her want to come back
you can only do things to make her not want to come back
so the only difference is if i forget about her or pretend to forget about her
well that sucks
so its almost a retroactive decision
so i could like lets say forget about her and when she comes back make like i just pretended to forget about her
or more likely the opposite
wait what do you mean
i mean first youll pretend not to care not call whatever and then eventually you really wont care
unless she comes back first
ah see thats the thing
somehow they dont come back until you really dont care anymore
theres the rub
theres the rub
sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time
hey man dont sweat it
its just that youve been there
your advice really helps
rob i just want you to know youre the only one i can talk to about her
close up on answering machine
mike pushes the button
synthesized voice hello you have five messages
mikes eyes light up
he paces in anticipation as the tape rewinds
male voice hey baby
i hope youre feeling better about your old girlfriend
i hope my advice helped
mike fast forwards to next message
synthesized voice skipping message
male voice whatsup mike
if you want to talk some more about michelle
synthesized voice skipping message
female voice mike its chris

synthesized voice skipping message
tension grows with every inch of spooling tape
did she leave a message
female voice hi mike

if she didnt then she doesnt deserve
synthesized voice skipping message
the last one
its a long shot but hes got the faith
elderly female voice michael this is grandma
i want to know if you got the part on that television program
i told the whole family and theyre very excited to know if
synthesized voice skipping message
end of final message
lighting a cigarette defeated shit
synthesized voice you have to put things in perspective
unfazed by the sentient appliance i know i know
synthesized voice youve been through worse
synthesized voice ever since ive known you
i dont know about that
synthesized voice moving here from new york was much more of an adjustment than this
it didnt feel that way
synthesized voice thats because it was a challenge
you has control over youre situation
it was hard but you rose to it
ill think about that
synthesized voice you really should
life after all is really just a series of challenges
growing irate enough
ive got to use the phone
synthesized voice are you calling her
stop come on
the led goes black as the machine beeps off
mike picks up the phone and hits autodial
machine beeps off
phone rings again then is answered
over phone hello
lemme get off the other line baby
we hear the clicks of call waiting hold limbo
the silence is interrupted
synthesized voice over phone you should call your grandmother
returning to line that was sue
we got two parties tonight
ones for a modeling agency
i dont know
listen to me baby there are going to be beautiful babies there
trent i dont feel like going out tonight
i got shit to do tomorrow

you gotta get out with some beautiful babies
you cant sit home thinking about her
i dont know
i dont know i dont know listen to you
were gonna have fun tonight
we gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment
were gonna spend half the night driving around the hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks then were gonna look for this other party you heard
but trent all the parties and bars they all suck
i spend half the night trying to talk to some girl whos eyes are darting around to see if theres someone else she should be talking to
and its like im supposed to be all happy cause shes wearing a backpack
half of them are nasty skanks who wouldnt be shit if they werent surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes
im not gonna be one of those assholes
its fucking depressing
some skank who isnt half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me it makes me want to puke
beat you got it bad baby
you need vegas
what are you talking about
were going to vegas
ill pick you up in a half an hour
im not going to vegas
shut up yes you are
now listen to tee
well stop at a cash machine on the way
a long thoughtful pause
i cant lose more than a hundred
just bring your card
half an hour
what are you wearing
i mean we should wear suits
now mikey wants to be a high roller
no seriously if youre dressed nice and you act like you gamble a lot they give you free shit
wear a suit im telling you it works
mike is dressed to the nines in classic vintage threads
hes trying to look at ease as he straightens his cuff links
he approaches trent who suavely leans against his worn down ride
hes a tall slim good looking cat
his sharkskin suit hangs well on his lanky frame as it tapers to his ankles
sinatras come fly with me on the tape deck adds an elegance to the scene
they exchange an impish grin and depart without saying a word
maybe this isnt such a bad idea
the needle is pinned
the gauges are blurred by the vibration of the poorly tuned engine
the shot widens to reveal that the oil and service dummy lights are both illuminated causing an eerie red glow onto trents white knuckles
trents car is red lined
the swingers are vegas bound
do not pass go
counting bills i took out three hundred but im only gonna bet with one
i figure if we buy a lot of chips the pit boss will see and theyll comp us all sorts of shit then we trade back the chips at the
end of the night
you gotta be cool though
im cool baby
theyre gonna give daddy a room some breakfast maybe bennetts singing
this is how you do it
im telling you
daddys gonna get the rainman suite
were going to vegas
you think well get there by midnight
baby were gonna be up by five hundy by midnight
mike twists up the chairman of the board as we
the two swingers are starting to fray around the edges but are unwilling to admit it to each other or themselves
frank has been replaced by talk radio
the needle is still buried
sleep deprivation and desert static radio
mike is sleeping in the passenger seat
wake up baby
look at it baby
trent points out a mountain range
it is now the only thing separating them from their destination
the surreal glow of the desert sky is accentuated by the loud slashing of the cobalt and ruby lasers emanating from a source masked by the craggy peaks
mike slowly stirs from his slumber
he is transfixed by this affrontation of nature
it is his first glimpse of the city without god
in reverie vegas
the shrill cry of basies fat brass section heralds the arrival of the young swingers
their eyes drink every watt of golden light as sinatras crooning urges them on
mike has either had enough sleep or so little that it no longer matters
either way theres no turning back
they roll up to a casino valet
tilt up to a skull and crossbones which looms overhead
the two guys walk and talk down a fluorescent hallway
it is well past midnight and the only patrons at this hour are tourists too drunk to sleep and compulsive gamblers who snuck out of their rooms without waking their
it is a weeknight and it is beginning to become painfully obvious that our boys are overdressed
the decor is nautical plaster
castings of bearded men with primitive prosthesis clutching daggers between their teeth are everywhere
all of ye olde promenade shoppes are closed
the first budding of crankiness pirates of the fucking caribbean
this is the hot new place besides you love pirates
tell me mikey doesnt love pirates
this is fuckin post pubescent disneyland
you gotta love the pirates baby
the pirates are money the corridor empties into the equally kitch casino
this place is dead
i thought this was the city that never sleeps
thats new york baby
you should know that
look at the waitresses
im gonna get me a peg leg baby
theyre all skanks
baby there are beautiful babies here
tee the beautiful babies dont work wednesdays midnight to six
this is the skank shift
what are you talking about
look at all the honeys
trent contorts his face at a cute waitress passing by with a tray of drinks
the waitress cracks a smile as she crosses away
mike is visibly embarrassed
cut that shit out
she smiled baby
thats not cool
did she or did she not smile
it doesnt matter
im telling you they love that shit
youre gonna screw up our plan
were gonna get laid baby
first lets see what happens if we play it cool
you think shes gonna tell her pit boss on us
dont make fun i think we can get some free shit if we dont fuck around
whos fucking around
im not making fun
lets do it baby
the trick is to look like you dont need it then they give you shit for free
well you look money baby
we both look money mike points to a semi curtained semi roped off area near the baccarat tables
the clientele is classier but theyre still obviously overdressed
pointing thats where we make our scene
you think theyre watching
oh theyre watching all right
mike is at a blackjack table with trent at his side
the game has paused to observe the newcomers as mike draws a billfold out of his breast pocket
theyre pulling it off with only slightly noticeable effort
i dont know i guess ill start with three hundred in uh blacks
mike tries to hand the dealer a handful of twenties after counting them twice
on the table
you have to lay it on the table
uh i dont want to bet it all
the other players grow impatient
youre not allowed to hand me money sir
youll have to lay it on the table if you want me to change it
hastily laying down the bills oh
the dealer lays out the bills such that the amount is visible to the camera encased in the black glass globe overhead
trent and mike look up at it open mouthed like turkeys in the rain
mikes attention is recaptured by the dealer but trent continues trying to peer through the smoked glass
you want this in black chips
sure thatll be fine
the dealer chirps out an unintelligible formality and the pit boss chirps the response
trents focus whips away from the camera as both he and mike stare at the pit boss ten feet away
the dealer plunks down the measly three chips which represent mikes entire cash reserve
not quite the effect he had hoped for
the swingers stare at the chips
the players stare at the swingers
the dealer stares at the pit boss
do you have anything smaller
yes but im afraid this table has a hundred dollar minimum bet
perhaps youd be more comfortable at one of our lower stakes tables
the dealer indicates a five dollar table across the room where an hispanic woman deals to a bluehair a biker and a couple in matching siegfried and roy t shirts
the swingers look back to the dealer who is now flanked by the pit boss
the tense silence is broken by
then to trent how about you capn trent looks over to see that its the same waitress who flashed him a smile earlier
at first he begins to smile then remembering that he is locked in a high stakes battle of wills subtly shakes her off
she smirks and starts to leave until she is interrupted by mike holding up a finger
its a balsy move but everyones watching
the kids going for broke
to the waitress but never breaking eye contact with the dealer ill have a vodka martini straight up shaken not stirred very dry
trent is impressed but masks his pride
under her breath cynically as she writes it down one james bond
regaining composure no
blacks will be fine
mike throws a chip in the circle
trent is shocked
thats a hundred bucks
mike and trent share a look
the dealer and the pit boss exchange glances
bets are all down and the cards are meticulously dealt
the dealer has a two showing
mike has been dealt a five and a six eleven hushed tones double down
even husheder what
double down baby
you gotta double down on an eleven
i know but
you gotta do it
but thats two hundred dollars this is blood money if we dont look like we know what were doing then we may as well
everyones waiting for them
the dealer the pit boss and all the players look on as mike drops another black chip in the circle with a barely audible yet deafening thud
with all the nonchalance he can muster double down
a bead of sweat
the sharp snap of a dealt card
its a seven
eighteen disappointment twists their faces
finally the dealer flips over his card
its a king
twelve here comes the bust
sixteen here comes the bust
twenty one groans all around except for the swingers who watch their chips slide away in silence
mike breaks the spell with a plucky smile from the pit of his stomach
to the pit boss sure could use some dinner about now
trent and mike are wedged between the bluehair and the biker at the five dollar table
they share a pile of red chips
im telling you baby you always double down on an eleven
well obviously not always always baby
im just saying not in this particular case
but i lost
how can you say always in the meantime the bluehair has been dealt an eleven
this captures the swingers attention
fifteen all together
i dont know
seventeen dealer has a seven showing
what the hell hit
twenty one with a warm smile twenty one
polite applause from around the table which the bluehair humbly waves off
mike looks at trent
a different pit boss approaches
would you care for some breakfast maam
no i shouldnt
thank you though
to trent under his breath im gonna fuckin kill you
mike is presented a stack of twenties by the cashier who counts them out
trent looks on
one hundred and twenty dollars
we hope to see you back on the high seas soon
polite smile mike throws her a disgusted look then turns to go
trent struggles to cheer him up
youre up twenty bucks baby
mike throws him a disgusted glare
well you know not counting the first table
thanks for clarifying that
hey man im down too you know
yea how much
i dont know what
thirty forty maybe
dont give me that shit
you know exactly how much you lost
whatd you drop
but i was down at least fifty
im sorry i got hot at the crap table
theres nothing to be sorry about
youre a winner
im the fuckin loser
i should be sorry
baby dont talk like that baby
lets just leave
baby youre money youre the big winner
condescending whos the big winner
mike looks away shaking his head in disgust
lifting mikes reluctant hand from the wrist like a boxing champ mikeys the big winner
shaking his head to hide a smirk what an asshole
okay tees the asshole but mikeys the big winner
the same waitress from before approaches the swingers as they are about to leave
there you two are
i walked around for an hour with that stupid martini on my tray
we got knocked out pretty quickly
a couple of high rollers like you
could you believe it
wait here ill get you that martini
nah i didnt really want it anyway
i just wanted to order it
can i get you something else
i mean you shouldnt leave without getting something for free
why ruin a perfect night
condescending bring a james bond for me and my boy mikey and if you tell the bartender to go easy on the water
holds up a half dollar this kennedy has your name on it
now run along im timing you
the waitress smiles in spite of herself shakes her head and walks away
what an asshole
that was money tell me that wasnt money
that was so demeaning
she smiled baby
i cant believe what an asshole you are
did she or did she not smile
she was smiling at what an asshole you are
she was smiling at how money i am baby
im not paying for a room and if we dont leave now well never make it
the honey babys bringing us some cocktails

daddys gonna get her to bring a friend
well both get one
i dont care if im with her or one of her beautiful baby friends
i dont know
you gotta get that girl out of your head
its time to move on
youre a stylish successful good looking cat
the ladies want to love you you just gotta let them
youre money any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you
its just that ive been out of the game so long
trent i was with her for six years thats before aids
i dont know how to talk to them i dont know
you cant think like that baby
its hard i know
ive been there

its just tough after sleeping with someone you love for so long to be with someone new
who doesnt know what i like
and you gotta wear a jimmy
gotta and then im struggling to impress some chick whos not half as classy as my girlfriend who im not even really attracted to
oh fuck that
you dont have to try and impress anyone
you think i give a shit
you think i sweat that skanky whore waitress
tee is interrupted by the waitress who thank god barely missed his comment
recovering looking at watch one fifty nine two minutes
two vodka martinis straight up shaken not stirred very dry easy on the water
what time are you off
reads nameplate christy
mike cant believe it
tee is just making it happen
call a friend and have her meet the three of us at the landlubber lounge at
trent throws the half dollar on her tray trent and mike are looking at menus
theyre smoking at the table because the can
that was so fuckin money it was like that jedi mind shit
thats what im telling you baby
the babies love that stuff
they dont want all that sensitive shit
you start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream
they know what you want what do you think
you think they dont
they know what you want believe me
pretending is just a waste of time
youre gonna take them there eventually anyway
dont apologize for it
im just trying to be a gentleman show some respect
respect my ass
they respect honesty
you see how they dress when they go out
they want to be noticed
youre just showing them its working
you gotta get off this respect kick baby
there aint nothing wrong with letting them now that youre money and that you want to party
the coffee shop waitress approaches the table
shes cute but not nearly as hot as christy
are you ready to order
points to trent who nods two coffees
it says breakfast any time right
ill have pancakes in the age of enlightenment
it goes over like a lead balloon
ill have the blackbeard over easy
ill be back with the coffee
she takes the menus and goes
genuinely nice baby
i shouldve said renaissance right
it went over her head
baby you did fine
disgusted with himself age of enlightenment
like some waitress in a las vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure french philosophical reference
i may as well have just said let me jump your ignorant bones
its just i thought renaissance was too excaliber its the wrong casino
she wouldve gotten it though
you did fine
dont sweat her
were meeting our honeys soon
you know christys friend is going to be money
i hope so
checks watch we gotta go soon
its just down the hall
shes gotta change
well be fine
we didnt do so bad after all
baby were money mike tries to catch the attention of their waitress who is passing with a huge platter containing a breakfast banquet
were in a bit of a hurry
hang on voltaire
she passes their table and sets the entire feast in front of the bluehair from the casino who sits alone
i said two lox platters
this isnt thirty dollars worth of food
i have a thirty dollar voucher
this isnt my first time in vegas you know
christy is at the bar wearing acid washed jeans with a matching denim top
shes sexy in a pathetic mid eighties sort of way
shes sitting next to a pretty brunette lisa dressed in a similar fashion
there is something bizarre about her appearance
her hair is tied into long pig tails with powder blue ribbons
her makeup job is almost theatrical with bright pink red lips
she cant be that out of it or can she
the girls have already been flanked by a herd of potential the swingers saunter up to the girls in a smooth slow motion the girls notice them
the courtiers sense their rejection and part like the red sea for the swingers in perfect slow motion choreography
hi boys we almost gave up on you
oh are we late
there are no clocks in this town
well no harm done
this is lisa
im sorry i never got your names
with contempt and this is my friend doubledown trent
working the bit stop
then to the girls ladies dont you double down on an eleven

what a lovely makeup job
lisa works at the mgm grand
apologetically im a dorothy
trying to sell her to mike oh

another lead balloon
what do you guys do
im a comedian
more uncomfortable silence

you wouldnt understand
whos your booking agent

im actually uh between what do you do trent
im a producer
mike rolls his eyes at how full of shit he is
listen im not really allowed to drink here
we should go someplace else
hows my place
the swingers exchange a glance
sounds good to me
sure establishing shot of an airstream trailer dug into the desert on chocks
trents car and two el caminos are parked out front
the foursome now somewhat more intimate sit huddled around the fold out table
theyve been drinking whiskey and long neck buds judging by the recyclables
the pairings seems to be trent christy mike lisa
the cramped compartment is filled with secondary smoke and laughter
the worst was when i went in for this after school special and im sitting in the waiting room with all these little kids
i see theyre all signed in for the same role as me
they were auditioning for the same role as you
so i check the time and place
im where im supposed to be
i call my agent
she says they asked for me specifically
what was the part
i love you
i cant believe youre doing this
drugs are bad
after school bullshit
the role is brother
big brother little brother
so i go in
we loved your guest spot on baywatch
blah blah blah
so i start to read and mikey i was money
i prepared for a week
its a starring role
the casting director she starts crying
oh my god

i hold up my finger like wait a second
they sit in silence for like at least five minutes
i look up and they all start clapping and now theyre all crying
even the camera guy no
not the camera guy
im telling you

so i swear to god this is exactly what he said
the producer says to me
now hes still crying
he says to me that i was great that that was exactly what they were looking for
so give me the fuckin part
that i nailed it
then he says its just that im a little old im like how old is the brother
hes like he says this with a straight face i swear to god he says eleven so whatd you say to him
they all crack up even more
its like you looked at my tape
you saw my picture
why did you call me in
you knew i was twenty four
what an asshole
i believe it
the room dies down
the girls settle into the arms of their men
theres a lot of body language and pheromones but not a lot of words
how rude of me
i havent given you the tour
she gets up and leads trent into the sleeping compartment to the rear
the door slaps shut
mike and lisa in all her made up glory look into each others eyes
trent is already at work
a cascade of stuffed animals tumble off the bed with every thrust
clothes start to peel off
trent takes a breather
he takes a step to the door
let me just check on my boy
hes in good hands
trent cracks the door and peers through
the light is dim but he can make out that theyre starting to neck
he closes the door satisfied
coyly what a good friend
i can use a friend like you
she beckons him back to bed what seemed like necking is actually lisa and mike huddled tight having an intimate conversation
reassuring im sure shell call
six years is a long time
you dont just break it off cleanly after six years
i know but she did
shes with someone else now
you poor thing
it wont last
its a rebound
we were a rebound and we lasted six years
yeah but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from six years
can i check my messages
i have a calling card

the phones in the back
mike gets up and approaches the door
sorry its just that
mike lightly knocks on the door
knock knock tee
the door cracks
sorry man i need
trent pokes a condom through the door
i need to use the phone
i gotta use the phone
baby youll check them tomorrow
i have to use the phone
the door closes
to lisa i hope im not interrupting anything
they werent in there that long
lisa reassuringly shakes her head
christy walks out wearing only trents sharkskin jacket as a robe
trent follows with a towel wrapped around his waist
trent glares at mike as they pass
apologizing to christy as she exits ive got a calling card theres no charge to your phone
half naked trent and christy sit with fully clothed lisa
to lisa the poor thing
and shes with someone else
the poor thing
ill make some coffee
trent is not happy
mike is on the phone
synthesized voice she didnt call
disappointment pulls at mikes brow
the girls clean up the bottles and ashtrays
the coffee is brewing
the shades are up
its officially morning
trents chin is in his hand
he radiates the blue tinge of glandular congestion
hell have no part of any of this
hes so sweet
he really said that
i believe it too
he really just wants her to be happy
he is so sweet
the girls immediately stop their chatter and look at him in anticipation
mike shakes his head no
the girls walk to embrace him in consolation
trent just shakes his head
hell have no part of any of this
establishing whot of trents car heading back to l
on the northbound i
the speeding car is dwarfed by the expansive badlands
she asked me what i was thinking about
what should i have done
you didnt have to get into it baby
sorry about interrupting
dont worry about me baby
i just wanted you to have a good time
christy was nice
i didnt even like her to be honest
she was hot
she really didnt do it for me baby
howd you like dorothy
i dont know
the whole judy garland thing kind of turned me on
does that makes me some kind of fag
she didnt like me anyway
she thought you were money
i dont think so
i heard them talking
they both thought you were money
yeah a good friend
baby you take your self out of the game
you start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream of course its gonna be on the friend tip
i just dont think she liked me in that way
baby youre so money you dont even know it
tee girls dont go for me the way they go for you
michelle went for you right
that was different
i was younger
it was college
you didnt go to college you dont know what its like
you screw chicks you have no business being with
theyre young they dont know any better
thats just plain silly
your self esteem is just low because shes with someone else
but thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad
its no good man
you gotta get out there
the ladies want to love you baby
i just need some time
so you can beat yourself up
sitting around in that stuffy apartment
its just plain bad for you man
youve come so far
remember the first week
after she told you
you couldnt even eat
dont remind me
you just sat around drinking orange juice
now look at you
look how far youve come in just a few months
you got that part in that movie
a day whatever
youre doing what you love
whats she doing
selling scrap metal
and what does this guy shes with do
he drives a carriage
smiling i hear he drives a carriage around central park or something
and youre sweating him youre all that and youre sweating some lawn jockey
i hear shes getting real fat
baby shes the one who should be thinking about you sounds to me like you cut loose some dead weight
trust me mikey youre better off
trent cranks some frank
you make me feel so young
mike is finally genuinely smiling
he turns down the music enough to talk
im gonna try
im really gonna try
trent just smiles and cranks frank back up trents car drives off into the distance
a sign reads los angeles miles
establishing shot of mike and rob teeing off with nine irons
rob wears a yale sweatshirt
mike wears one from queens college
a mets cap shades his eyes
neither have shaved and odds are neither showered
they each carry a loose nine blade and putter as they wander to their lie
i dont think im gonna take it
is a gig
i mean i need the money
youre an actor
find the zen in the role
its definitely a step back for me
look theres not much of a call for shakespeare in this town
theres just something about being goofy
any other disney character would be fine
theres just this stigma associated with the character
what do you want
do you realize how hard its going to be to tell my parents
i still havent told them i didnt get the pilot
you tested over a month ago
im sure they figured it out by now
its like hi mom
im not going to be starring in that sit com and oh by the way im goofy
send more money
they split up and both over chip the green miserably
mike and rob putt
havent you noticed i didnt mention michelle once today
i didnt want to say anything
i dont know
its like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter
like you didnt want to jinx it
i dont talk about her that much
i didnt mention her once today
well until now
tend the pin
mike pulls out the flag for robs putt
the only reason i mentioned her at all is to say that im not going to talk about her anymore
i thought youd appreciate that
good for you man
ive decided to get out there
re the ball go ahead
play it out
rob putts the gimme
he misses by an inch
im not making any more excuses for myself
rob taps it in
he tends the pin or mike who misses
good to hear mikey
mike putts again and misses
you want to hit the town tonight
i shouldnt mike its a weeknight
what do you have
a pluto call back
kick me when im down
mike plunks it in
count em up
the two of them count and recount as they revisualize each shot in their head
throughout the process they count under their breath and point to different parts of the fairway and green
the two of them revolve point and mumble for an absurdly long amount of time until finally
how many strokes
i dont know
eight or nine
ill give you an eight
writes score whatd you get
looks like were in a dead heat after one hole
this is turning into quite a rivalry
rob points to the far off crowd of a dozen irate golfers waiting to tee off
you better replace the pin chi chi
the natives look restless
first of all sue is a guy and a tough guy at that
he is wearing an l
kings home jersey
his sweater bears the sacred number
sue is lounging in front of the tv in army surplus khaki cutoffs and untied doc martin boots
sue brushes back a shock of straight greasy dirty blonde hair as not to obscure his view of the screen
his face glows with the reflection of the sega hockey game on the set
sue and trent are locked in a heavily contested battle of motor reflexes
nothing moves but their eyes thumbs and mouths
you little bitch
chelios to roenick
mike looks on
he is more captivated with the simulated sporting event than the clippers game on the tv across the room
electric guitars blaze over the stereo
the room like the guys could use a spring cleaning
pizza boxes beer bottles and full full ashtrays
you can taste the smoke
you little bitch
gretskys on his ass again
because hes a bitch
thats so bullshit
this is so bullshit
you should play another team
the kings are bitches in this game
i took the kings to the cup against the computer theyre a finesse team
theyre a bitch team
roenick fuck that is so bullshit give it up sue
the phone rings
sue picks it up and balances it on his shoulder as he plays
re game shit back to phone yeah
the elevator doesnt work
he lets the phone drop
then to mike its pink dot
buzz him in hit nine
mike picks up the phone off the matted shag carpet
he pushes listens then hangs up
i wish the game still had fights so i could bitch slap wayne
this version doesnt have fighting
doesnt that suck
that was the best part of the old game
i dont know
i guess kids were hitting each other or something
you could make their heads bleed though
if you hit them hard their heads bleed all over the ice and their legs convulse
its kinda money actually
make someone bleed
no man were in the play offs
ill make gretsky bleed the little bitch
the delivery man knocks on the door
trent pauses the game give me the money
ill get it
while sue gives mike the money trent unpauses the game and checks gretsky into the boards leaving him writhing in a pool of red pixels
you bitch sue dives onto trent
they wrestle a little too rambunctiously for indoors
trent pulls the hockey sweater over sues head and starts wailing on his back
the camera follows him down a shallow hallway to the door
he unlocks it
a delivery man of eastern hemispheric decent is out of breath from four flights of stairs
he hands mike a twelve pack of bud cans and three packs of marlboro reds
he can hear but not see the chaos ensuing in the living room
trent and sue are flushed
they pause long enough to torment mike
feigning homosexuality is he cute ask him if he wants to stay for a cocktail
following suit is he brown mike forces an apologetic smile
he is embarrassed
the delivery man doesnt seem to understand any of this
mike out of guilt hands him a four dollar tip
this he seems to understand
he smiles and leaves
mike crosses back to the main room
you guys are such assholes
continuing the gag aww
he got away
untangling himself from trent gimme my reds
ive been jonesing for an hour
mike throws him a pack of smokes which he unravels with surgical precision
cans of beer are tossed around and cracked
what times this party tonight
it starts at eight
which means no one will get there til ten
im gonna bring and old friend who just moved out here
you met him once
hes a rounder
whats he do
hes trying to be an actor
what a surprise
mike and rob walk down the dirty deserted alleyway
mike is wearing baggy slacks doc martin shoes and an oversized eisenhower cut jacket with a vertical stripe inset
the collar is large and pointy but definitely not seventies
his ensemble has more of an early sixties vibe
rob hasnt been at it quite as long
hes wearing worn in levies over worn in boots and the nineties standby an untucked flannel
mike walks with purpose
he intermittently tries to pull open locked steel doors along the alley
rob looks confused
so if the party starts at eight why are we first going to a bar at ten
to get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven
beat where is this place
pulling handle its one of these
for some reason cool bars in l
have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front
that doesnt sound too good for business
pull its kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing
its kinda cool
its like youre in on some kind of secret
you tell a chick youve been some place its like bragging that you know how to find it
the only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there
you have to have someone come before
there is a direct line connecting you back to the original unequivocally cool club patrons
its kinda like judaism
sounds more like aids
thats probably a more appropriate analogy
at this point they come upon an unmarked black metal door which mike successfully pulls open to reveal
a smoke filled windowless black walled room
there are several round padded booths lining the walls
the place is packed and the funk standard brick house throbs over the a handheld shot as the two guys serpentine to the mirrored bar at the far end of
enshrined in its center is a framed photograph of sinatra smiling in approval as he presides over the evenings activities
mike proudly points out the photo to rob
kinda money huh
mike catches the attention of a cute female bartender
ill get a dewars rocks
looks to rob bud
a dewars on the rocks and a bud please
i cant get over how cute the girls in this city are
its like the opposite of inbreeding
the hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool
darwinism at its best
ive been around here six months and i still cant get over it
its like every day i see a beautiful woman
im not used to that
im used to seeing a beautiful woman i dont know once a week
i cant handle it
wait till summer
i swear you cant leave the house
it physically hurts
i cant wait till i actually get to touch one of them
ah theres the rub
theres the rub
the bartender serves them their drinks
mike turns to see charles
a young black man with a tight dolomite fro
he wears a black leather blazer over a black turtleneck
just look up cool in the dictionary
a handshake turns into a hug
whats up man
did you um did you get that pilot
i know you didnt get it cause you wouldntve asked me
it wasnt that funny anyway
piece of shit
listen charles this is my friend rob from back east
charles and me went to network on this pilot together
i just tested for one
yeah a month ago
oh im sorry
howd your folks take it
i havent heard an official no yet
you havent told then huh
i still havent told my folks i didnt get deepspace
youd think theyda figured it out by now but mom keeps asking
and boy does it hurt when they ask
i dont even tell them about anything im close on anymore
not until you book it
and even then
you might get cut out
im considering taking a job as a goofy
at least its disney
you want to come with us to a party at the chateau marmont
they got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies
yelling over the roar of the wall to wall crowd why not
this place is dead anyway
mike trent sue charles and rob sit around the round scotch plaid corner booth of the retro hip coffee shop
all of our boys with the exception of rob are classily dressed
they wear a lot of black brown and gray with a splash of gold and maroon
the camera revolves around the table in a repeating reservoir dogs style over the shoulder degree pan
i got a better one
you gotta admit the steadycam shot in goodfellas was the money
through the basement of that restaurant
the copa in new york
through the kitchen
i heard it took four days to light for that shot
i dont know about four days
thats what i heard
i mean you gotta hide all the lights
it looked money
not as money as the shot from reservoir dogs which one
in the beginning
when theyre walking in slow motion
how can you compare them
tarantino totally bites everything from scorsese
hes derivative you gotta admit it looked money
i heard they made that whole movie for ten grand whats the big deal
everyone steals from everyone
checking his watch well lets hit that party
the five swingers walk down the boulevard in a slo mo shot which is extremely derivative of the reservoir dogs credit sequence
the scene is choreographed to bennetts big band arrangement of o sole mio
muffled music seeps through the door
the swingers turn the knob and enter
the huge sunken living room is packed with people congealed into circles of conversation and sipping cocktails
everything stops when they enter
the music the conversations all movement everything
everyone in the room stares at them standing in the doorway
the music starts back up and everyone returns to their conversations
the swingers weave their way through the crowd to
the swingers fix themselves drinks from an assortment of bottles cluttering the table
the shamelessly paw at the top shelf brands
who threw this party anyway
damned if i know
i came with you with that the three of them peel off to work the room
whats that guys name
sue sue his dad was big johnny cash fan
oh like that song
a boy named sue
i think thats why hes such a bad cat
hes a mean dude
ive seen him smash a guys face into the curb
he knocked out his teeth
he was just like boom boom boom
fuckin nasty shit man
hes a nice guy though
trent and sue are scouting some ladies across the room
one wears a funky oversized hat
intermittent eye contact has been established
oh its on baby
its on mike and rob have come back into the room
they scout the terrain
there are so many beautiful women here
i got to at least try once
youre a better man than i am charlie brown
no i just promised myself id give it a try
i gotta get out there sooner or later
go for it man
mike spots a pair of beautiful blondes in black
theyre wearing stretch bell bottoms and tops that expose their mid drifts
the seventies never looked so good
indicating the ladies im going in
will you be my wing man
ill be your winger
they make the approach
with a great deal of effort mike catches their attention
good evening ladies
only to be interrupted by the party stopping to check another entrance
the party resumes and the blondes redirect their attention to mike
he is a little put off but god love him he gets back in there
how are you ladies doing this evening
what do you drive
what kind of car do you drive
the blondes immediately enter back into their conversation as if they were never approached
mike and rob exchange defeated glances
one more try
trent and sue are trying to look like theyre not paying attention to the group of ladies they saw across the room
is she looking at me baby
is she looking now
no shes not looking at you
she hasnt looked at you once will you stop asking if
wait she just looked
mike and rob walk up to trent and sue
how you guys doing
indicated the group of girls with a subtle head move minnie pearl
mike and rob stare directly at the girls like a deer in the headlights
a big no no
the one in the hat
trent and sue react with frustrated disappointment
what are you doing
you looked right at her baby
she didnt notice
yes she did
now i gotta go in early
dont sweat it baby
this ones a lay up
trent crosses away
hows it going for you two
of trent passing near and the girl in the hat
he says something smiles and points to her hat
well just watch the t bone and learn
trent is having a sensitive one on one with the girl in the hat
ive always wanted to be an actress at least as long as i could remember
i went to
under trents affirmative response we hear the first haunting tuba pulse of the jaws theme nodding in agreement uhhhh huuuhhh close up of mikes face as he looks on in
horrified awe from afar
then one day after class my drama teacher the one who directed the play said he thought i should
the second tuba pulse accompanies trents sound of agreement uhhh huuhh extreme close up of mikes horrified eyes
i met with an agent last week and im waiting to hear
the third and progressively faster tuba pulse sounds under trents response as the jaws theme begins to speed up and fill out uh huh uh huh uh huh uh huh
mike rob and sue look on
here comes the kill
the groups p
of the conversation
the jaws theme reaches its violent crescendo as the girl looks into her purse
trent winks to the boys
she comes up with a pen and writes our her phone number
trent crosses back as the music dies away
using his body as a shield so the girl cant see but so his boys can he rips up and drops the number as he approaches them
was i money
i dont know
it was kind of a dick move if you ask me
whatd i do wrong
you asked her for her number and then you tore it up
she didnt see
that doesnt matter
that was pretty cold dude
what was cold about it
the door opens
the party pauses to look then resumes
she offered me her number
what should i have said
that wouldve hurt her feelings
this way she feels like the winner
trent smiles and waves to her across the room
she coyly waves back and makes a phone sign with her hand
trent nods and smiles
tee cant roll with that shes business class
explaining to rob big butt
you know cant fly coach
i cant believe you
charles approaches the crew
theyre out of glenlivet
what else is going on
we could hit the dresden
overhead long shot of the swingers entrenched in the crowded yeah
this place is dead anyway
the swingers have left the party and are heading to their cars
they are all parked in a row one behind the other
they each climb behind the wheel of their own car
they pull out in unison
they travel like a train with their bumpers almost touching
shots of the car train driving and making turns
o sole mio reprise
the car train breaks up to nose in park behind the bar
they all club their steering wheels
the swingers lounge in a booth against the cork paneled wall sipping cocktails
they watch marty and elayne the resident lounge act perform a jazz fusion cover of staying alive on synth and upright bass
the seventies are alive and well here but theyre starting to yellow around the edges
the room is busy but not packed
the swingers have all had a few
i know what youre saying man
i dont know what to tell you
i mean does it have to be goofy
i was playing hamlet off broadway two months ago for crying out loud
trent and sue are involved in a different conversation
they are observing two hot girls at another cocktail table
the girls are wearing short plaid skirts with black stockings pulled up to midthigh
its the catholic school girl gone bad look
the girls are a little too touchy feely with each other suggesting a certain sexual open mindedness
its on you think
baby i know it is
its a black diamond trail
but its worth the risk
true or false its worth the risk
as they get up to leave
god bless you guys
they cross to the ladies
the girls seem at first cold the receptive
trent and sue join their table and share some laughs
mike half heartedly looks on
he is obviously not happy with where he stands on the bell curve of masculinity
mike looking for any kind of escape crosses to the bar
mike unsuccessfully tries to catch the attention of the middle aged bartender
to himself i cant even get this guy to notice me
a cute blonde sitting at the bar chuckles at his comment
mike is at first self conscious then pushes ahead
you like laughing at the misery of others
im sorry i couldnt help it
let me make it up to you
she raises her finger and the bartender immediately approaches
what can i get you
ill have a dewars on the rocks
he goes to fix it
ive seen you somewhere
where have i seen you
you ever go to the kelbos
i host an open mike
youre a comedian
whats that like
trying to bluff not an ounce of sarcasm well you know its tough
a lot of traveling
a lot of hotels
but you know its a dream
and the moneys really good
i think i might buy another really expensive imported car after my next gig in vegas
politely interrupting i know
i served you an espresso at starbucks
are you sure
you asked me for an application
i introduced you to the manager
trying to pull out of the dive oh yeah
boy that mustve been a while ago
id say about two weeks
probably a little longer than that but whatever
smiling at him you better pay the man
mike notices the bartender who has been waiting patiently with the drink
fumbling with the money oh
he pays and throws down a two dollar tip apologetically
tactical retreat well thank you
thank you nikki
he walks away kicking himself
he is interrupted by trent and sue who both hold up cocktail napkins with scribbles
we got the digits baby
what a surprise
i saw you talking to that beautiful blonde baby
she was cute
she didnt like me
i made a fool of myself
baby dont talk that way baby
you are so money and you dont even know it
thats what i keep trying to tell him
to mike youre so money you dont even know
please dont mess with me right now
were not messing with you
youre like this big beer with claws and fangs
and big fuckin teeth
and shes like this little bunny cowering in the corner
and youre just looking at your claws like how do i kill this bunny
youre just poking at it
youre just gently batting it around
and the rabbits all scared
and you got big claws and fangs
and youre like i dont know what to do
how do i kill this bunny
youre like a big bear
youre not just like fucking with me
youre money youre so fuckin mmmoney now go over there and get those digits
pulling him aside dead serious now when you talk to her i dont want you to be the guy in the pg movie that everyones pulling for
i want you to be the guy in the rated r movie who youre not sure if you like
mike nods and energized by the bombardment crosses back to the bar and right into the fray
trent and sue rejoin the other swingers
of mike decisively engaging her in conversation
out comes the pen and the cocktail napkin
mike crosses back to the swingers table and using his body to shield nikkis view pretends to rip the napkin
this breaks the guys up
mike sits down and after admiring the blotchy numerals delicately folds the napkin and pockets it
its not that hard
everyone reacts favorably to this area code
how long do i wait to call
tomorrow then a day
so two days
i guess you could call it that
thats the industry standard
shop talk i used to wait two days
now everyone waits two days
three days is kinda money now dont you think
but twos enough not to look anxious
yeah but three days is kinda the money
interrupting sarcastically why dont i just wait three weeks and tell her i was cleaning out my wallet and found her number
then ask where you met her
yeah ill tell her i dont remember and then ill ask what she looks like
pause then ill ask if we fucked
hows that tee
is that the money
the guys laugh
laugh all you want but if you call to soon you can scare off a nice baby whos ready to party
dont listen to him
you call whenever it feels right to you
how long are you guys gonna wait to call your honeys
the swingers are leaving through the back door
the doorway is congested with another group of guys who are entering
a bald guy with a goatee brushes by sue
watch where youre going asshole
whatd you say bitch
i said watch where youre going bitch
now theyre squaring off in the empty parking lot
all the bald guys boys fall in behind him
all the swingers fall in behind sue
the swingers are not happy with sue at all
the two cliques contrast each other in every way
the bald guys all have facial hair and multiple pierced extremities with the odd neck tattoo thrown in for good measure
baggy denim and boots
pot leaves and pumas
long heavy key chains
vintage whiteboy faux gansta
they do however look big and mean next to our boys
the early sixties style sweater jackets and blazers over button down shirts and tapered slacks dont quite have the same fear factor but the boys do look classy
the word bitch is growled out by the two of them a half dozen more times until
sue pulls a pistol out of his belt
everyone is scared
especially the swingers
now what bitch
now whos the bitch bitch
the bald guys hold up their hands and slowly back up to their ride
im the bitch
im your bitch okay
were just gonna leave
im the bitch
im such a bitch i cant even begin to tell you
they jump in the car and speed away
sue belts the gun and stands tall like clint
what the fuck
what an asshole
didnt you see boys in the hood
now one of us is gonna get shot
hes a bitch
he aint gonna do nothing
whatd you want me to do
he called me a bitch

rob leaves shaken up
why are you carrying a gun
in case someone steps to you snoop dogg
hey man youre not from here
you dont know how it is
i grew up in anaheim
things are different here
its not like new york mikey
here its easier to avoid trouble
its not like you like in compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day
nobodys mugging you on no subway

out here you gotta go look for it
people get carjacked
oh who would jack your fuckin k car

you dont need no gat
just because i was the only one with the balls to stand up to them
oh yeah like cypress hill was gonna do anything
you live in such a fantasy world

youll fuck it up

did you fuck once
shut up sue
i know for a fact you havent because you never shut up about it
your like a little whiney bitch
mike walks to his car
its too late
sue starts to open his mouth
dont even talk to me
pause you asshole mike opens the door and flicks on the lights in his sparsely furnished single
he drops his keys on the table and makes a bee line to the answering machine
he pushes the button
synthesized voice she didnt call
mike collapses into his futon and lights a smoke
he pulls out the cocktail napkin
he stares at the number
he looks at the clock
he looks at the napkin
he thinks better of it and puts the napkin away
he takes out the napkin and picks up the phone
synthesized voice dont do it mike
it rings twice then
this is nikki

calmly dont call me ever again
wow i guess you were home
click she hung up on him
he hangs up
he pulls the comforter off the futon and curls up in the corner of the room
the following sequence is m
over billie holidays maybe youll be there
younger mike catches his first glimpse of michelle
she doesnt see him looking at her
she is paying attention to the lesson
mike approaches michelle for the first time
she looks beautiful when she looks up at him for the first time
theyre having a picnic with white wine cheese prosciutto and french bread
mike plays a ukulele
mike and michelle sit with a lap full of food
they are laughing about something
mike leans in for his first deep passionate kiss
the crowd jumps up to cheer a daryl strawberry home run which the lovers dont notice
they stay seated kissing and are lost to the camera in the crowd
their first sexual experience
mike is obviously nervous as he lies undressed under the covers
he sporadically adjusts his hair and strikes poses as he waits for michelle to come out of the bathroom
this is intercut with shots of the closed bathroom door
mike and michelle are christmas shopping in the snow
its like a story book
a newspaper barely noticeable on stand in b
reads vito mike and michelle lethargically lay across the couch
they half heartedly watch a rented video as they shovel chinese take out into their bloating faces
mike and michelle say good bye
they hug and cry
he boards a plane for l
shot of answering machine
trents voice pick up
pick up mikey
are you home
he is sitting in the same corner smoking with a two day beard
he is surrounded by full ashtrays and empty tropicana containers
billie holidays maybe youll be there draws to a close on the c
trents voice i guess youre not home
why dont you come out tonight baby
we havent seen you for two days

beep he hasnt moved
the phone rings
he looks to the answering machine hopefully as it picks up after one ring
robs voice mikey

his shoulders slack with disappointment
its not her
robs voice im downstairs
buzz me in
i know youre home
your lights are on and your cars here
come on buddy
mike picks up the phone pushes and hangs up
he lights a cigarette
a knock at the door
mike opens it and rob walks in with a brown bag
he surveys the scene
hes seen this before
he moves some laundry off an armchair and sits down
he pulls a pepperoni and a loaf of seminola out of the bag
he hands mike a pint of orange juice
no problem buddy
you eat anything today
mike shakes his head no
mike shakes his head again
you havent been drinking have you
rob cuts into the pepperoni with his swiss army knife
mike drinks his juice
sorry about what happened at the dresden
i had no idea
dont sweat it
now i got an l
you should hear the way i tell to the guys back home
he had an uzi
mike half smiles
you want to talk about it
whats the point
its been two days
you should call that girl nikki
mike grabs his head in pain
im such an asshole
she wasnt your type anyway
i think im gonna move back east
well thats dumb
whats dumb about it
well youre doing so well
how am i doing well
i host an open mike and i played a fuckin bus driver in a movie
big fuckin deal
im with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians
how good am i doing
at least you didnt get turned down for goofy
they turned you down
they went for someone with more theme park experience
i woulda killed for that job
mike lets it sink in
see its all how you look at it
if your life sucks then mine is god awful
i mean i moved out here partially because i saw how well you were doing
you got in the union you got an agent
i thought if you could make it maybe i could too
i didnt make it
thats your problem man
you cant see what youve got only what youve lost
those guys are right
you are money
mike smiles then
starting to cry then why wont she call
because you left man
shes got her own world to deal with in new york
she was a sweet girl but fuck her
you gotta move on
you gotta let go of the past
the future is so beautiful
every day is so sunny out here
its like manifest destiny man
i mean we made it
whats past is prologue
that which does not kill us makes us stronger
all that shit
youll get over it
how did you get over it
i mean how long til it stopped hurting
sometimes is still hurts
you know how it is man
i mean each day you think about it less and less
and then one day you wake up and you dont think of it at all and you almost miss that feeling
its kinda weird
you miss the pain because it was part of your life for so long
and the boom something reminds you of her and you just smile that bittersweet smile
we see that mike has been gnawing away at robs pepperoni and semolina as he listens intently
you miss the pain
for the same reason you miss her
you lived with it so long
finishing the loaf you wanna grab a bite
he helps mike up
by the way the guys back home said she put on some weight
smiling you always know the right thing to say
trent opens the door
he sees mike standing there dressed for trouble
his face lights up
guys mikeys here
from the living room mikey
mike hears the sound of a hotly contested sega match
you little bitch
the camera follows mike and trent into the
mikes jaw drops when he sees that sue has been playing hockey against the bald guy from the dresden
the room is filled with the bald guys crew
they greet mike as they take hits off their forty ouncers
they do a high speed controller handoff
sue crosses to mike
im so sorry man
you were so right i got rid of the gun what are they doing here
we ran into them that night at roscoes
tee cleared it up i apologized bought them some chicken and waffles
they fuckin love tee
that boy can talk
all the baldies howl and slap hands at something funny tee said
but most important man im sorry about what i said
i was drunk
my adrenaline was going
dont sweat it man
i needed a kick in the ass
were better friends for it
they hug ive been hating myself for the last two days
believe me i know what thats like
then to trent yo double down
what time are we leaving
five minutes baby
hey its been two days
you should call nikki and see if she wants to meet you there
the three swingers are waved pass the line by the doorman in a scorsese style steadicam shot which continues up the stairs and through a curtained doorway into
they enter the domed decco lounge and the full house parts for them and greets them in perfect scorsese choreography
they pass the billiard table and the circular brass rail bar
the six piece swing band decked out in zoot suits wail on stage as the crowded dance floor whirls
the swingers eventually settle into a dark curtained off onstage booth
sue thrusts a scotch into mikes hand
montage of smoking drinking and carousing
the parquet floor is packed with swinging hepsters dressed in hollywoods take on forties threads
the dancing is full blown overcrowded slam swing
the floor is full and everyone is damn good
this definitely aint amateur night
mike steps up to the bar to refill his drink
he sees a brunette sitting at the bar
theres something fresh about her
shes dressed nice but different
she definitely is not a regular
she throws mike a half smile then looks away
he looks away
he shakes his head to himself
he looks over at her again
of a white bunny sitting on the bar stool
he smiles shrugs and crosses to her
when he gets to her she has reverted back to human form
like the quiche
like the quiche
i like quiche
i thought real men dont like quiche
my reputation seems to have preceded me
youre not a real man
trent points the conversation out to sue from across the room
trent and sues p
of mike and lorraine having an unforced enjoyable conversation
its on its on
so i thought what the hell they make movies in l
not in michigan so i moved here
just like that
well it wasnt the simple but yeah
how was it hard
well i left someone very special behind
tell me about it
lights up i thought i was going to die
its been six months and im just starting to get over it
thats two more than me
tell me it gets better
smiles it does
well it still sucks but you start to see that there are advantages to being single
coyly like what
you said there are advantages to being single
i want to know what the advantages are
playing along well
you can talk to a beautiful woman at a bar without worrying if anyones watching you
trent and sue are watching from across the room
its definitely on
you have complete freedom
to do what
i dont know
to grow to go out
whatever you want
like if i meet a handsome young man and i wanted to ask him to dance
i can do that
uh if the guy wants to
you dont think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with
i mean no
i mean maybe he would find her i mean you attractive
maybe he doesnt like to dance
maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who dont dance either
maybe it doesnt matter if hes a good dancer cause its a slow song if thats what hes afraid of
maybe thats not the case
maybe she shouldnt be such a smug little shit because shed be surprised at what a good dancer he really is but its been a long time and he doesnt
know if hes ready to
she gets up
she is beautiful
will you dance with me
shes in great shape and look how classy her vintage dress looks
a vision from the forties
shes too good for this place
she belongs on the nose of a b
what can he say but
sure i will
he awkwardly leads her to the unusually empty dance floor
they start to dance
its a slow song and they boringly rock back and forth
mike is self conscious but her touch
oh her touch
trent and sue watching in disbelief
it is on it is so on
the couples dance is cut short as there were only a few bars left of the slow ballad
mike smiles politely in relief and begins to lead lorraine off the floor
she pulls him back
hes not getting off that easy
she wants a whole song
he politely holds her poised for another slow number
theyre alone on the floor
much to mikes dismay the song begins with a driving tom tom solo
this cues every hep cat in the derby that the big ones coming
they all flood the floor for the last dance of the night
mike pleadingly shakes his head at lorraine
its too fast
her eyes narrow as her grip tightens
no sympathy here
the band breaks into the full tilt swing number and the dance floor writhes around them
they stand motionless for what seems like an eternity
sink or swim
mike grabs her like a man grabs a woman
its just a simple six count swing step but theyre in perfect harmony
mike and lorraine look into each others eyes
its on baby
as mikes courage grows the moves start to flow
a spin at first
then a double twirl
its not long before hes throwing her through combinations that stand out even among the pros
trent and sue mouths agape
mike is whipping her smoothly through violent looking combinations without a trace of hesitation and boy can she follow
the set ends with a flourishing crescendo
theyre frozen in a final dip panting through a glaze of clean sweat
mike and lorraine smile and look into each others eyes
the smile slowly disappears
will they kiss
lips almost touching
mike tries to muster up the courage but its been so long
he cant do it
he lets her up
the floor clears
exhausted dancers push past them
the moments gone
what the hell
they had a great time
whats the hurry
mike is walking lorraine to her car
they come upon a parked escort
this is it
i had a great time
i would love to see you again sometime
ill be around
thats not good enough
i want to make plans to see you
let me get a pen out of my car
opens the door do you have something to write on
mike hands her a business card
looking at it youre a comedian
and an actor
ill have to come see you sometime
if and when i get a real gig ill call you
its not going to well
when i lived in new york they made it sound like they were giving out sit coms to stand ups at the airport
i got off the plane in l
six months ago and all i got to show for it is a tan
didnt you tell me to be patient with my career
yeah but entertainment law isnt something you just jump into
neither is acting
not if youre serious about it
she writes her number on the card
can i have one of these
why you like the duck with the cigar
hands her a card yeah
its the logo from you bet your life right
not one club owner got it
they all ask me why i got donald duck on my card
hey at least its not goofy
well i should be getting
its really getting late
its getting late
can i give you a ride to your car
im right across the street
the red piece of shit over there
well it suits you
get the hell outta here already
mike leans in and slowly gives her the sweetest softest most innocent kiss
he backs up
shes got that goofy look as she unlocks her club and starts the car
she drives off
he watches her go
mike is driving trent and sue home in his car
you were off your ass back there
where the hell did you learn to do all that twirly whirly shit
i took a ballroom class with michelle
i never danced with anyone but her til tonight
that lorraine chick is good you were good
did you see how she was vibing you
you probably coulda hit that tonight if you didnt have to drive us home
its not like that
dont give me that
she liked you man
i know she liked me
i mean its not like i wanted to do anything with her tonight
good for you man
hes being smart
shes really special guys
the bears got his claws back
be smart about it
im telling you
wait three days
you dont have to wait three days
just be smart about it
i got it under control
hes got it under control
well then i guess we dont have to worry about him anymore
our little babys growing up
trent and sue pretend to cry and hug each other
mike looks at them in the rear view mirror
he smirks and shakes his head
you guys are such assholes
trent and sue scream at the top of their lungs as they cruise down sunset
alcohol is a terrible drug
mike is standing in the middle of the room looking at lorraines number on the back of the business card
he looks at the clock
he looks back at the number
he thinks better of it
he wedges it into a crack in the answering machine and unbuttons his shirt for bed
synthesized voice good move
mike wakes up and rolls out of bed
he walks to the phone and pulls the card out of the crack
he looks at the clock
he sticks it back in the crack
he makes an x on a day of his calendar
mike brushes his teeth
he looks at the card clipped into the frame of the bathroom mirror
he turns the faucet allowing exactly one drop of his precious los angeles water supply to drip onto his toothbrush
he resumes brushing
mike sips espresso as he stares at the card
mike is playing solitaire with the card laying above all the playing cards
the phone rings
mike rushes to get it then forces himself to wait another ring and a half exactly
hows it going
its been a while
how are you doing
pause i think about things
what kind of things
you know us
i thought you met someone else
it doesnt matter
i think about you every day
i miss you mike
why didnt you call
do you know how hard its been not to call you
i pick up the phone every night
whenever that commercial comes on
the micheline commercial
yeah with the baby in the tire
one time i started to cry right in front of pierre
thats his name
is he french
no hes not
listen i dont want to talk about him
thats a whole other headache
i called because i heard you might be moving back to queens
the beep of mikes call waiting
let me get rid of this call
he clicks to the other line
are you on the other line
yeah hold on
i can call back
he clicks back to the other line
i heard you might be moving back
yeah uh i dont think thats gonna be happening any time soon
listen can i call you right back
i gotta take this call
im not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week
cant you talk for five more minutes
i really want to catch up with you but ive gotta take this call
ill talk with you when you get back in town
click mike switches lines cutting michelle off mid sentence
sorry about that
you didnt have to get off the other line
i wouldve called you back
i wanted to talk to you
mike holds his palm over the receiver and looks at the answering machine
to answering machine do you realize that ive been waiting for that call for six months and i cut her off
synthesized voice youre money baby
back to lorraine
medium shot of mike through his window as he looks down onto franklin avenue and talks on the phone
thanks for holding on
you really didnt have to get off the line
i just wanted to ask you one thing
i know i shouldnt have called i mean my friends said i should wait two days
oh god i probably sound like such a schoolgirl
its just that its tonight only
i mean its sinatras birthday and they have this thing every year at the room
do you know where that is
its impossible to find if youve never been there
i dont understand why none of the clubs in hollywood have signs
anyway im so bad at this if youre not busy i thought you might
mike smiles as the camera pulls back from the window and backwards down franklin avenue in a reverse of the first shot of the movie
the soundtrack kicks in with sinatras heres to the losers
heres to those who love not too wisely no not too wisely but too well
to the girl who sighs with envy when she hears that wedding bell
to the guy whod throw a party if he knew someone to call
heres to the losers
bless them all
we rise and pass the glowing hollywood sign
its still a full moon
heres to those who drink their dinners when that lady doesnt show
to the girls who wait for kisses underneath that mistletoe
to the lonely summer lovers when the leaves begin to fall
heres to the losers
bless them all
past the blinking red beacon of the capital records building
hey tom dick and harry
come in out of the rain
those torches you carry
must be drowned in champagne
up and over hollywood boulevard
high above the city
heres the last toast of the evening
heres to those who still believe
all the losers will be winners
all the givers shall receive
heres to trouble free tomorrows
may your sorrows all be small
heres to the losers
bless them all
its all just a pool of beautiful golden light
