by charlie kaufman and donald kaufman adapted from the book by susan orlean september second draft endless barren landscape
no sign of life
the atmosphere is hazy toxic looking
lightning strikes concussing murky pools of water
beamed ceilings and ostentatious fireplace
a few birthday cards on the mantel two of them identical to our dear son on his fortieth birthday
charlie kaufman a fat balding man in a purple sweater with tags still attached paces the room
his incantational voice over carpets the scene
i am old
i am fat
i am bald
my toenails have turned strange
i am repulsive
i dont know for i suffer from a condition called body dysmorphic disorder
i am fat but am i as fat as i think
my therapist says no but people lie
i believe others call me fatty behind my back
or facetiously slim
but i also believe this is simply my own perverted form of self aggrandizement that no one really talks about me at all
what possible interest is an old bald fat man to anyone
i am repulsive
i have never lived
i blame myself
i a lonely two lane highway cutting through swampland
as natural selection works solely by and for the good of each being all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to progress towards perfection
suddenly a beat up white van barrels around a curve
its followed closely by an old green ford
john laroche drives
hes a skinny man with no front teeth
the van is piled with bags of potting soil gardening junk
a writings of charles darwin audio cassette case is on the seat next to laroche
it is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank clothed with many plants of many kinds with birds singing
laroche tries to contemplate the plants and birds whizzing by
almost too late he spots the fakahatchee strand state preserve sign and makes a squealing right onto the dirt road turn off
the cassette case flies from the seat and half buries itself in an open bag of peat
russell vinson and randy three young indian men pass a joint and watch the erratic van ahead
laroche is asleep at the wheel
crazy white man is now drowsy white man
they share a stoned laugh
late night street
the click click of typing
we move slowly up the building to the only glowing window
wistful john laroche is a tall guy skinny as a stick pale eyed slouch shouldered and sharply handsome despite the fact that he is missing all his front teeth
in the window lit by a single desk lamp a woman types
we glide over the desk piled with books about orchids past a photo of laroche tacked to an overwhelmed bulletin board and come to rest on a woman typing
its susan orlean pale delicate and blond
we lose ourselves in her melancholy beauty
she turns to the camera and talks to us
two years ago i went to florida to meet laroche after reading a small article about a white man and three seminole men arrested with rare orchids theyd stolen out
of a place called the
tony a ranger drives along a dirt road past the fakahatchee strand state preserve sign and enters the swamp
he sees the white van and ford parked ahead spots a seminole license plate on the ford
he pulls over down the road and whispers into his c
we got a seminole or seminoles in the swamp
im on janes scenic drive just east of logging road twelve
i repeat indians in the swamp
tony waits for a response
tony contd indians in the swamp
tony clears his throat into the radio
i dont know what you want me to say
barry indians do not go on swamp walks
if there are indians in the swamp they are in there for a reason
tony glowers gets out of the truck watches the vehicles through binoculars
he straightens his cap
mosquitoes land on his neck his nose his lips
kaufman wearing his purple sweater sans tags sits with valerie an attractive woman in wire rim glasses
they pick at salads
kaufman steals glances at her lips her hair her breasts
she looks up at him
he blanches looks away
we think youre just great
with studied modesty oh thank you
valerie absently rubs her nose
kaufman self consciously rubs his nose in response
and were thrilled youre interested
valerie rubs her nose again
kaufman pulls at his nostril
a rivulet of sweat slides down his forehead
valerie watches it
kaufman sees her watching it
she sees him seeing her watching it
she looks at her salad
he quickly swabs
oh thanks wow
thats nice to hear
you have a really unique voice
i appreciate that
looking up so kaufmans brow is dripping again
he smiles embarrassed
sort of hot in here
kindly yeah it is a bit
so why dont you tell me your thoughts on this crazy little project of ours
in one motion kaufman swabs his forehead and pulls a book entitled the orchid thief from his bag
first i think its a great book
laroche is a fun character isnt he
kaufman nods flips through the book stalling
theres a smiling author photo of susan orlean on the inside back cover
and orlean makes orchids so fascinating
plus her musings on florida orchid poaching
great sprawling new yorker stuff
id want to remain true to that let the movie exist rather than be artificially plot driven
okay great great
i guess im not exactly sure what that means
im not sure exactly yet either
so um what its just i dont want to compromise by making it a hollywood product
an orchid heist movie
or changing the orchids into poppies and turning it into a movie about drug running
oh of course
or cramming in sex or car chases or guns
or characters learning profound life lessons
or characters growing or characters changing or characters learning to like each other or characters overcoming obstacles to succeed in the end
kaufman is sweating like crazy now
valerie is quiet for a moment
see we thought maybe susan orlean and laroche could fall in love during the course of
alienated journalist writes about passionate backwoods guy and he teaches her to love
i mean it didnt happen it wouldnt happen
the office is decorated with potted flowers audobon posters lots of books
kaufman nervous and sweaty watches margaret a soulful development executive unpack boxes
so anyway i just wanted to stop by to congratulate you on your promotion
well thanks again
its all so stupid
i think its great
your photo in the trades and everything
so whats up with you
im considering jobs
theres one you might like about flowers
what is it
they want me to do an adaptation of a book called the orchid thief
oh my god
i read that
i loved that book
kaufman is thrilled hes scored
margaret pulls a copy of the orchid thief from her bookshelf
margaret contd see see see
im not lying to you
i loved the book
oh charlie orchids are the most amazing flowers
margaret plops onto the couch next to kaufman
theyre really great
you should take this job
doesnt it sound exciting to immerse yourself in a real subject and learn everything about it
blake wrote about seeing heaven in a wild flower
and after you learn all this stuff you can teach me
thrilled but controlled thatd be fun
god theyre such beautiful flowers
and so sexy
whispering did you know that orchid means testicle
i just read that
shrieks with delight testicle
can you believe it
margaret giggles happily
kaufman giggles weirdly
margaret contd i swear itd be fucking great for someone to have the testicles to make that book into a movie man
instead of this bullshit all the time
something not about sex and violence and car chases and love stories people learning profound lessons
jesus isnt nature enough
hot dirty miserable
laroche leads the indians through waist high black water
he points out a turtle on a rock
did you fellas know you fellas believe the world rests on the back of a turtle
not you fellas specifically
although maybe you fellas specifically
that i cant speak to
the indians ignore him
laroche spots something else a dull green root wrapped around a tree
he stops circles the tree
his eyes widen in reverent awe
laroche contd polyrrhiza lindenii
the indians come around
laroche stares at a single beautiful glowing white flower hanging from the tree
he tenderly caresses the petals
then business like laroche contd cut it down russell
russell pulls out a hacksaw begins sawing through the tree
kaufman still sweats as he talks to valerie
plus i love the idea of learning all about orchids
i really admire those guys who know everything about ants or fungus or whatever
id like to be more like that
see i tend to write self involved self loathing
even masturbatory stuff
and its wonderful by the way
thats nice to hear
but i need to challenge myself as a writer
ive arrived at an age where i want to think about the world in a different way
adapting someone elses work is certainly an opportunity to think differently
and i welcome the challenge of taking a small subject like orchids something that would never draw people into a theater and making that fascinating
i want to show people heaven in a wildflower
as blake wrote
a serious ten year old boy walks from cage to aquarium studying the inhabitants
he turns to his frumpy mother whos been following at a respectful distance
any one at all ma
she nods sweetly
the boy returns to his search
he stops at a small turtle in an aquarium
boy contd i want this then
hugging him a wonderful choice
and spiritually significant
did you know that native americans believe the whole world rests on the back of a turtle
i cant wait to tell the guys
as laroche supervises randy russell and vinson saw through tree branches supporting lovely flowering orchids
they unceremoniously stuff the flowers into bulging pillowcases
kaufman eats with margaret
margaret raises a glass
to a fucking awesome assignment man
kaufman pleased clicks glasses
he takes a breath
hey im going to an orchid show sunday
maybe youll come
i think david this guy im seeing would enjoy it too
hes a real naturalist
okay if he comes along
covering heartbreak yeah of course
he wants to meet you anyway
all i do is tell him how great you are
thats nice to hear
youll like him
hes so honest and smart
its rare to find someone in this town who thinks about things other than this fucking business yknow
he sounds great
like the other day we were in bed discussing hegel
it was fucking amazing
have you read much
yknow a long time ago
well anyway david and i were discussing his philosophy of history and i was
the entrees arrive
margaret contd struck by his notion that history is a human construct
kaufman begins the laborious task of getting through his plate of food
he can no longer look up at margaret
that nature doesnt exist historically but rather cyclically
margaret contd so whereas human history spirals forward building upon itself nature
kaufman pulls a bunch of orchid books off the shelf carries them to the register along with a book on hegel which features an engraving of the philosopher on the
kaufman waits in line and watches the tattooed female cashier flirting with the handsome guy ahead of him
he studies their interaction the way she looks at him
her eyes her lips
the guy leaves and the cashier waves kaufman over
as she rings him up she expresses no interest in him
hes hurt and fixates on a sexy flower tattoo on her arm
she catches him pulls down her sleeve
tony waits sweaty and mosquito bitten
the radio crackles
hows that injun round up going tony
fuck you barry you fuckin
rustling near the parked cars
laroche steps from the swamp with the indians who haul the pillowcases
tony contd we got poachers
into the radio pleased we got fuckin poachers barry
tony jumps into the truck and turns it around
her delicate fingers move with a pianists grace across the computer keyboard
orchid hunting is a mortal occupation
an overturned boat and uprooted orchids float on the river
the victorian era orchid hunter william arnold drowned on a collecting expedition
a man lies at the bottom of a cliff clutching a flower
schroeder fell to his death
a man lies face down near an unplucked orchid
endres was shot dead in rio hacha
an emaciated limping wheezing man with a makeshift bandage wrapped around his head docks his boat
augustus margary survived toothache rheumatism pleurisy and dysentery
someone steps from behind a bush stabs him steals his boat
contd only to be murdered when he completed his mission and traveled beyond bhamo
the murderer sails down river
contd laroche loved orchids but i came to believe he loved the difficulty and fatality of getting them almost as much as he loved the orchids themselves
tony steps out of his truck
laroche smiles warmly
may i ask what you gentlemen have in those pillowcases
yes sir you absolutely may
laroche goes back to directing the indians
okay im asking then
oh okay then
peeking in bags five kinds of bromeliad one peperomia nine orchid varieties
about a hundred and thirty plants all told which my colleagues have removed from the swamp
youre aware that its illegal to remove plants or animals from state owned land
and dont forget these plants are all endangered sir
every one of them
well thats exactly the issue
this is a state preserve
yes sir it is
afterthought oh and my colleagues are all seminole indians
did i mention that
youre familiar im sure with the state of florida v
tony nods even though he has no idea
laroche contd so you know that even though seminole chief billie killed a florida panther one of what forty in the entire world
laroche looks to the indians for confirmation
they give it
laroche contd the state couldnt successfully prosecute him
because hes an indian and its his right
as repugnant as you or i as white conservationists might find his actions
not to mention the failed attempts on three separate occasions to prosecute seminoles for poaching palm fronds which i believe they use to thatch the roofs of their traditional chickee
laroche again looks to the indians for confirmation
thats exactly what we use them for
tony looks at the indians
yeah but i dont
i cant let you fellas go yet
just hold on while i
into radio hey barry can i get some help
we watch orlean as she drives out of the miami airport parking lot onto the freeway past congestion and billboards
her mournful face glows beautifully dramatically with golden sunlight
she talks to us
nothing in florida seems hard or permanent
the developed places are just little clearings in the jungle but the jungle is unstoppably fertile everything is always growing or expanding
at the same time the wilderness disappears before your eyes
orlean gets quiet
her eyes tear
a seven year old girl is gleeful as her parents push her on a swing
she watches from the air as her mother and father deeply in love kiss between pushes
kaufman gets out of his car with his books
two teenage girls walk by
kaufman watches as one whispers to the other
he thinks he hears the word fatso
the girls giggle
kaufman passes a hall mirror regards himself glumly and climbs the stairs
i am fat
i am repulsive
i cannot bear my own reflection
at the landing kaufman comes upon donald his identical twin brother on his back in pajama bottoms opening a gift box
did you open your present from mom yet
whats with you
kaufman nods vaguely continues down the hall
donald pulls a purple sweater from the box calls after kaufman
donald contd hey charles youll be glad i have a plan to get me out of your house pronto
a job is a plan
is your plan a job
big build up im gonna be a screenwriter
kaufman doesnt respond enters his bedroom
donald contd i know you think this is just one of my get rich quick schemes
but im doing it right this time
im taking a seminar
kaufman lies face down on his mattress on the floor
its only five hundred bucks
muffled by pillow screenwriting seminars are bullshit
kaufman pulls a copy of variety open to a photo of margaret from under his pillow
he gets lost in the picture
in theory i agree with you
but this one is highly regarded within the industry
donald dont say industry
donald now in the sweater appears on all fours in the doorway
kaufman puts the paper back under his pillow
im sorry i forgot
charles this guy knows screenwriting
people from all over come to study his method
ill pay you back man
as soon as i sell let me explain something to you
anybody who says hes got the answer is going to attract desperate people
be it in the world of religion indicating his back i just need to lie down while you explain this to me
lies down stares at ceiling okay go ahead
there are no rules to follow donald and anybody who says there are is just
not rules principles
mckee writes a rule says you must do it this way
a principle says this works
and has through all remembered time
the script im starting its about flowers
no ones ever done a movie about flowers before
so therere no guidelines and thats good because what about flowers for algernon
thats not about flowers
and its not a movie
oh okay i never saw it
my point is those teachers are dangerous if your goal is to do something new
and a writer should always have that goal
writing is a journey into the unknown
its not building a model airplane
donald stares at the ceiling fuming
getting no no response he pulls out his hegel book and reads each being is because posited an op posited a conditional and conditioning the understanding completes these its limitations
by positing the opposite
kaufmans head is spinning
he puts the book down
both brothers stare at the ceiling
donald finally speaks mckee is a former fulbright scholar
are you a former fulbright scholar charles
the young boy eats with his family
his father wears a backbrace his sister is weak and anemic
only his sweet mother pays attention as he chatters excitedly
turtles are of the order testudine
and theyre found on every continent
every continent huh
the turtle shell has remained unchanged for two hundred million years
and theres all different kinds pelusio gabonensis phyrnops rufipes chitra indica dermochelys coriacea coriacea
ranger sheriff and state police cars are parked near the van and ford
lots of sweating uniformed people
the pillowcases have been emptied the plants lie on black plastic sheets
a guy sprinkles water on them
laroche enthusiastically helps ranger mike owen catalogue the flowers
the indians lean against their car bored and smoking
nirvana seeps tinnily out the car window
and what we have here my friend is thirteen encyclia cochleata
four encyclia tampensis im sorry encyclia what
pointing to each coch le ata
tem pen sis
checks owens spelling okay lets see twenty two epidendrum nocturnum
a very good haul
two catopsi floribunda
three polyrrhiza lindenii the ghost orchid
what i really came for
these sweeties grow nowhere in the u
except in your swamp
boy you really know your plants mr
im one of the worlds foremost experts
but thatll all be revealed at the hearing
kaufman sits at a card table picking at a salad and reading an orchid book
donald lies on the floor chomping a hoagie and reading a copy of story by robert mckee
the orchidaceae is a large ancient family of perennial plants with
kaufman bored looks over at donald whose cheeks are stuffed with food
the most memorable fascinating characters tend to have not only a conscious but an unconscious desire
although these characters are unaware of their subconscious need
maybe you should watch what you eat donald
did you ever consider maybe youre a bit fat
does it ever occur to you you kind of represent me in the world
that people look at you and think hes charlies twin therefore thats what charlie must look like
by the way moms paying for the seminar
did you even hear what i said
i pitched mom my screenplay jesus dont say pitch
anyway she loved my
telling of my story to her
she said its like silence of the lambs meets psycho
hey maybe you and mom could collaborate
i hear shes really good with structure
you think youre so superior charles
well im really gonna write this
and youll see
you suck okay
the two glare at each other
they go back to their books
florida is a landscape of transition
do not proliferate characters do not multiply locations
rather than hopscotching through time space and people discipline yourself to a reasonably contained cast and world
orlean drives on state road past prefab housing into swampland
she talks to us
florida is a landscape of transition and mutation a hybrid of unruliness and orderliness nature and artifice
she brushes a wisp of hair from her face and tucks it behind her small pretty ear
we linger on the ear which grows pink with sunlight
orlean catches us and smiles shyly
kaufman traces a stubby nail bitten finger along state road along a florida road map
he turns to his typewriter and types in a clumsy hunt and peck style
we open on state road
a lonely stretch of road cutting through untamed swampland
suddenly a beat up white van barrels around a curve
its driver a skinny man with no front teeth
the proceedings are in progress
orlean hurries in sits in the back
laroche in a miami hurricanes cap wrap around mylar sunglasses and a hawaiian shirt is on the stand
alan lerner the tribes lawyer questions him
laroche what is your experience in the area of horticulture
okay ive been a professional horticulturist for twelve years
ive owned a plant nursery of my own which was destroyed by the hurricane
im a professional plant lecturer
ive given at least sixty lectures on the cultivation of plants
im a published author both in magazine and book form
i have extensive experience with orchids and the asexual micropropagation of orchids under aseptic cultures
this is laboratory work not at all like your nursery work
grins im probably the smartest person i know
youre very welcome
as she rings up his books kaufman admires the cashiers flower tattoo
she catches him and smiles with red wet pierced lips
she unbuttons her blouse and shows him a breast with a heart tattoo
a sweet heartbeat turns to knocking
kaufman in bed masturbating looks up at the closed door
the door opens
donald stands there for a moment in shadows
look you wanna hear my pitch or what
god damn it
lost yknow im just trying to do something
kaufman squints at his brother sits up waits
hey thanks a lot man
flicks on light then in pitch mode okay theres this serial killer right kaufman groans lies down pulls the covers over his face
see hes being hunted by a cop
and hes taunting the cop right
sending clues who his next victim is
hes already holding her hostage in his creepy basement
so the cop gets obsessed with figuring out her identity and in the process he falls in love with her
even though hes never even met her
she becomes like the unattainable like the holy grail
through a blanket its a little obvious dont you think
okay but theres a twist
see we find out the killer suffers from multiple personality disorder
see hes really also the cop and the girl
all of them
its all him
isnt that crazy
donald waits proud
kaufman pulls off the covers
look the only idea more overused than serial killers is multiple personality
on top of that you explore the notion that cop and criminal are really two aspects of the same person
see every cop movie ever made for other examples of this
mom called it psychologically taut
the other thing is theres no way to write this
did you consider that
i mean how exactly would you show a character holding himself hostage
okay thats not what im asking
what im asking is in the reality of this movie if theres only one character right
how could you
what exactly would the scene
donald waits blankly
kaufman gives up gets out of bed dresses
kaufman contd i agree with mom
i dunno something very taut
orlean exits the courthouse and watches laroche in a huddle with lerner vinson and buster baxley vice president of the tribes business operations
theyre all smoking intently
theyre gonna fucking crucify me
ill go into the fakahatchee with a chainsaw
i swear to god
buster for crying out loud i reminded her the indians used to own fakahatchee
look well deal with all this at trial
buster waves a dismissive hand at lerner walks away
vinson shrugs stubs his cigarette follows buster
lerner and laroche stand there a moment
lerner walks off
laroche cracks his neck
a charmingly shy orlean approaches
orlean smiles apologetic for the intrusion
my names susan orlean im a writer for the new yorker
its a maga im familiar with the new yorker
the new yorker yes the new yorker
so i was interested in doing a piece about your situation down here
laroche scowls smokes furiously then a test yeah
put this in i dont care what goes on here
im right and ill take this all the way to the supreme court
that judge can screw herself
orlean scribbles on her pad
laroche twists his head to see that shes writing judge can screw herself
laroche contd that for real would go in
laroche smiles his toothless smile at orlean
music lush profound orchestral piece
a glorious orange large petalled orchid blooms in dramatic time lapse
we slowly lovingly circle the flower
the orchidaceae is a large ancient family of perennial plants with one fertile stamen and a three petalled flower
in most orchid species one petal is enlarged into a lip and is the most conspicuous part of the flower
kaufman in a booth reads his orchid book takes notes
the orchidaceae is a large ancient
hes bored looks up watches a waitress with glorious orange hair pouty lips soulful eyes and a voluptuous form turning slowly around scanning her station
she sees kaufman approaches and smiles warmly down at him
her badge reads alice arcadia ca
so what looks good today
the key lime pie please
a small slice
im watching my
and a coffee please
sees book orchids
i absolutely love orchids
he goes blank
theyre really great
he flinches at his response
a small awkward pause
so ill be right back with your pie
she smiles warmly again and leaves
kaufman is humiliated
alice the waitress and kaufman walk hand in hand inspecting sexy orchids together
she smiles warmly at him
i love you i absolutely love orchids
kaufman finishes jerking off
he lies lonely in the dark
dark and muted
the seven year old girl is pushed on the swing by her father
from the air she sees her mother tiny and lost sitting across the yard smoking
orlean leans against a car and smokes
a tiny lost figure
theres a honk
orlean snaps out of her reverie to see laroche screeching to a stop in his banged up van
to camera a few days after the hearing laroche took me to an orchid show in miami
she opens the passenger door
orlean contd hi
thanks for picking i want you to know this van is a piece of shit
when i hit the jackpot ill buy myself an awesome car maybe an aurora
orlean nods climbs in and tries to rearrage some of the junk on the front seat so shell have a place to sit
laroche contd sit on top of that
you wont hurt it
she situates herself on the seat
laroche lurches off
laroche drives manically
orlean watches the road and holds one hand against the dashboard
the thing you gotta know is my whole life is looking for a goddamn profitable plant
and thats the ghost
why the ghost orchid
the suckers rare
collectors covet what is not available
im the only one in the world who knows how to cultivate it
he looks at her and smiles
orlean smiles back and indicates with a small jerk of the head that he might want to watch the road
he doesnt take the hint
laroche contd the plan was get the indians to pull it from the swamp
i researched it
as long as i dont touch the plants florida cant touch us
then id clone hundreds of them babies in my lab sell em and make the seminoles a shitload of change
in handwriting made jerky by the bouncing van orlean writes shitload of change on her notepad
laroche contd and i stop future poaching by making the flowers readily available in stores
then i give a big speech at the trial about how the legislature should get rid of loopholes smart people like me can find
im a hero
the flowers are saved
laroche and nature win
old black and white footage taken from up high of two th century men leading a horse drawn cart full of poached orchids
men from florida dominated the orchid hunting scene
hunters in the fakahatchee hauled out thousands of orchids in horse drawn flatbed carts
the camera swoops down close to the men
as it does the image transforms
it turns to color the men become mannequins the horse becomes papier mache its a display
a live man in modern work clothes is arranging actual orchids in the cardboard cart
kaufman drives slowly past barnes and noble squints in the window sees the tattooed cashier
he passes burger king sees a pretty employee the same at starbucks
glassed in women on display different types different attitudes
kaufman stops in front of the california pizza kitchen
alice and her orange hair glow through the window
he hesitates then drives off
kaufman sits on the floor and types
a beautiful orange orchid blooms in time lapse donald enters
kaufman ignores him continues typing
donald dawdles picks up the orchid thief flips through it
contd the camera circles it revealing how lovely and perfect and sweet and inviting and delicate and
what do you want donald
i just read about that swamp ape that supposedly lives in the swamp
you should put that in your script like killing people or something
thatd be very very cool
why are you in here now
nothing i was just
oh one thing i need a cool way to kill people
for my script
kaufman stares at donald rubs his eyes then um okay killers a literature professor who cuts off little chunks of his victims bodies until they die
hed be known in the tabloids as the deconstructionist
thats kinda good
i like that
see i was kidding donald
you got me
do you mind if i use it though
there are now many turtles in aquariums
many turtle books and posters
the boy in a turtle t shirt looks out the window into the darkness
his eyes are troubled
the boy comes downstairs
his father in his backbrace watches tv his sister lies on the couch semi conscious more pale than before
his mother pats the girls head with a damp cloth
theres a little hindu altar with candles
praying softly for certain is death for the born and certain is birth for the dead therefore over the inevitable thou shouldst not grieve
sweet sweet diane
the boy surveys the sad scene
his mother looks up smiles
a slice of pie for my turtle expert
the boy beams with pride then gets solemn
mom theres something i feel i have to do
i dont know how to do this but i feel in my stomach that i have to
what do you have to do honey
collect one of every turtle in the world
beat its a long list ma
cuora galbinifrons graptemys versa callagur borneoensis all the galapagos species people think theres only one but thats hardly the case
cycloderma frenatum cuora pani
sighs i dont think my life is worth living if i cant do this
the boy and his mother look at each other
well wed better get started huh baby
the boy nods his head solemnly
laroche drives solemnly nodding his head
orlean studies him for a moment her sad eyes wet and glistening
wow thats some story
so how many turtles did you end up collecting
matter of fact oh i lost interest right after that
i dropped turtles when i fell in love with ice age fossils
learned everything about them
collected the shit out of em
fossils were the only thing made any sense to me in this fucking world
they drive in silence
orlean watches a flying heron
then fossils were over when i found lapidary which i just adored
okay now what is lap ditched lapidary for resilvering old mirrors
did that with my mom for a while
we had the largest collection of th century dutch mirrors on the planet
perhaps you read about us
mirror world october
i have a copy somewhere
laroche fishes through junk as he drives
so did you ever miss the turtles
the only thing that made you ten year old life worth living
ill tell you a story
i once fell deeply profoundly in love with tropical fish
i had sixty goddamn fish tanks in my house
id skin dive to find just the right ones
anisotremus virginicus holacanthus ciliaris chaetodon capistratus
you name it
then one day i say fuck fish
i renounce fish
laroche contd i vow to never set foot in the ocean again thats how much fuck fish
that was seventeen years ago and i have never since stuck so much as a toe into that ocean
and i love the ocean
beat but why
shrugs done with fish
kaufman sits in silence across from his female therapist
so im still obsessed with that girl
the burger king girl
dimples and sparkly eyes
california pizza kitchen
red hair and nice
shes really nice
i feel pretty certain she likes me maybe
so do you think youll talk to this one
kaufman hair combed sits nervously in a booth watching alice
he tenses as she comes up to him
she smiles warmly
some key lime pie for ya today
thrilled she remembered okay yeah
that sounds great
ill pick you out an extra large piece
she winks at him
hes so in love
thats really sweet of you
still reading about orchids i hope
yes i am in fact
a friend of mine has a pretty little pink one grows right on a tree branch
thats whats called an epiphyte
pointing at him excitedly right
boy you know your stuff huh
im just learning
epiphytes grow on trees but theyre not parasites
they get all their nourishment from the air and rain
well im impressed
there are more than thirty thousand kinds of orchids in the world
wow thats a lot huh
okay then so ill be right back with a nice big slice of key lime pie for my orchid expert
she smiles and turns to leave
but so anyway i was also wondering
alice turns back still smiling
kaufman contd im going up to this orchid show on saturday in santa barbara and i alices smile slips away
her warmth dissipates
oh um well im sorry
nodding so ill be right back with your pie then
he nods watches alice walk away and say something to another waitress
the other waitress looks over at him
i am fat
i am old
i am repulsive
the other waitress brings his pie
he smiles a thank you
orlean sits at her desk and talks to us
there are more than thirty thousand known orchid species
one species looks like a german shepherd
kaufman walks alone among the crowd of orchid enthusiasts past a santa barbara orchid society sign
he tries to study the flowers
they are dull
he forces himself to look
one looks like an onion one looks like an octopus
kaufman finds his attention drifting from orchids to women all different shapes colors personalities some in subtle clothing some in garish clothing all glowing
contd like a school teacher one looks like a gymnast one looks like a midwestern beauty queen one looks like a new york intellectual with whom youd do the sunday
times crossword puzzle in bed
one looks like that girl in high school with creamy skin
one has eyes that dance
one has eyes that contain the sadness of the world
he is sick with adoration for the women who pay him no mind
contd nothing in science can account for the way some people feel about orchids
those love them love them madly
one by one the women turn to the men theyre with a whisper in the ear a shared look an arm slipped through an arm
kaufman is alone in this sea of people and flowers
teenaged laroche and his mother tromp through the swamp
he carries a camera on a tripod
they spot a beautiful flower
laroche is in awe
laroche sets up the tripod focuses on the flower
his mother almost cries at the flowers beauty
you will find something more in woods than in books
trees and stones will teach you that which you can never learn from masters
saint bernard said that
thats pretty ma
diane wouldve loved this flower johnny
maybe somehow she can see it
after this one how many honey
laroche snaps the photo makes a check in his notebook
only one hundred and seventeen more
and you have to have a photo of every single type of orchid in florida
i have to ma
you know that
she smiles at him rubs his neck
kaufman talks to the therapist
im successful right
i mean i could say to a woman im a screenwriter and shed look at me differently
i could get laid
but i want someone to like me
the way i like them
the way id do anything for that woman walking down the street
a million women walking down the street
i dont need to know what their jobs are
no one will ever love me like that
like i love almost every woman i see
kaufman glances down at his therapists breasts
he does it fast and unintentionally
he quickly shifts back to her face
his therapist wraps her shawl around her
crowded with orchid lovers
noisy chatter and calliope music
elaborate displays include orchids on a ferris wheel plastic clowns and a booth that looks like a circus big top
once you get the sickness it takes over your life
i started out just photographing em
now look at me
dramatic pause itll happen to you
i dont think so
im not prone to laroche runs over to a flower
darwin wrote about this one
annoyed i know who darwin is
a depressed kaufman fishes on his floor through an ever increasing pile of books books about turtles mirror resilvering tropical fish hegel etc
he picks up the portable darwin
the cover features a daguerreotype of darwin
kaufman paces and reads
a sickly darwin writes at his desk
therefore i should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form into which life was
kaufman looks off into space thinking
suddenly he grabs his mini recorder and paces like a caged animal
okay opening of movie
four billion years ago
life has not begun
endless barren terrain
laroche shows the flower to orlean
see that nectary all the way down there
darwin hypothesized a moth with a nose twelve inches long to pollinate it
everyone thought he was a loon
then sure enough they found this moth with a twelve inch proboscis proboscis means nose by the way and
i know what proboscis means
every one of these flowers has a specific relationship with the insect that pollinates it
theres an orchid that looks exactly like this particular insect
so the bug humps the flower and gets covered with its pollen
laroche mimes humping
i get it
thats called pseudo copulation
these flowers are smart
you gotta fall in love with them
once you learn anything about orchids youll devote your life to learning everything about them
orlean looks around people sniffing flowers feeling petals staring deep into nectaries
people jabber passionately people buy plants people carry boxes of purchased plants
orlean looks deeply into various flowers at a dizzying array of colors and shapes but remains detached
orlean stares at photos of orchids on her bulletin board
she cant find a way in
she looks over at her husband reading
he smiles at her
she smiles back but theres a terrible distance between them
she looks at us sadly
i wanted to want something as much as people wanted these plants but it isnt part of my constitution
orlean stares out the window at the empty street below
a plastic bag dips and rises in the breeze
orlean contd i suppose i do have one unembarrassed passion
beat looks back at us i want to know how it feels to care about something passionately
the seven year old girl swings sadly by herself
from high up she sees her mother in a window at one end of the house her father in a window at the other end
both stare blankly in opposite directions
the swing completes its arc and the girl descends losing sight of her parents
kaufman types furiously
hes a sweaty mess
then after the entire history of life on the planet in the last seconds of the montage we see the whole of human history tool making hunting farming war lust
religion self consciousness
cut to susan orlean writing a book about orchids
and the story begins
he reads back what hes written
im an idiot
i hate my the front door bursts open and donald charges in
mckee is a genius
he just comes up with these great jokes and everyone laughs
but hes serious too
youd love him
hes all for originality just like you
but he says we have to realize we all write in a genre so we must find originality within that genre
see it turns out there hasnt been a new genre since fellini invented the mockumentary
sadly quietly you and i share the same dna
is there anything more lonely than that
orlean eats a silent dinner with her husband
you want to do something tonight
i should work
ive got stuff
she smiles picks up her dish puts it in the sink
orlean looks at the photo of laroche sits sadly for a moment then types
laroche is an optimist
that is he sees a profitable outcome in every situation
when he was a young man he worked in construction
a younger laroche in a hard hat walks atop a half built house
he spots a flower in a backyard across the street
pleased with himself asclepiadaceae
from thirty yards
he loses his footing falls two storeys lands on his back
orlean takes notes
laughing i broke my back
exactly how my dad did
isnt that a psycho coincidence
far away yknow the way i see it were a family of ailments and pain
but anyway it was a godsend
laroche scarfs his pie
orlean watches him
laroche once spilled toxic pesticide into a cut on his hand
it resulted in permanent heart and liver damage
most people would consider this a terrible accident
laroche considered it a success
a prim woman reads a magazine article by laroche entitled would you die for your plants
theres a smiling photo of a frail emaciated laroche next to his byline
because he sold an article about it
laroche talks mouth full of pie
orlean takes notes
i consider the broken back in three places by the way
i have x rays fishes through bag a stroke of goddamn luck
i got disability married the sweetest woman in the world
and me and my lovely new wife my now ex wife the bitch got to open our nursery
laroche and his wife in wedding clothes stand outside their nursery the bromeliad tree posing for an auto timed photo
laroche wears a cumbersome back brace
the camera flashes
kaufman types tentatively
off screen we hear donalds enthusiastic typing and giggling
movie opens with susan orlean typing
refers to orchid thief john laroche is a tall guy skinny as a stick
stops flips through book movie opens with a young boy picking out his first pet
stops flips through book movie opens with
kaufman stops scratches his head
his hand is covered with loose hairs
laroche talks to orlean
people started coming out of the woodwork to ask me stuff to admire my plants to admire me
lots of lonely looking customers admiring orchids
laroche is in the midst of them happily chatting with whomever approaches him
one guy pulls laroche aside
john what is this
its so beautiful
its neat cause its dimorphic which means
customer enters with a creepy dark flowered orchid
look at that dracula vampira
its gorgeous man
other customers gather around
take me in to the fakahatchee
show me a ghost in bloom and its yours
laroche would you be able to laroche picks up a ringing phone
customer continues to try and get his attention while he talks
well sure you gotta watch the temperature
dont want an odontoglossum above seventy five
uh huh that should be fine
yeah damp it down
oh im doing well
shes fine too
orlean looks out at the dark night
i believe some folksd call me up to talk and just talk because they were lonely
orlean looks at him
after a long silence laroche muses laroche contd you know why i love plants
because theyre so mutable so adaptable
adaptation is such a profound process
beat adaptation means you figure out how to survive in the world
people arent too good at that sometimes
kaufman sits with his agent jerry in a glass walled office
i dont know how to adapt this
i shouldve just stuck with my own stuff
i dont know why i thought i could see her
i fucked her up the ass
jerry waves at a passing beauty
she waves back keeps walking
kaufman follows the girls ass with his eyes
hey maybe i can help
whats the problem buddy
kaufman looks at jerry
will he accept help from an agent
its about flowers
its not only about flowers
its got that crazy plant nut guy
hes funny right
kaufman pulls out a folded newspaper clipping reads there is not nearly enough of him to fill a book blah blah blah so orlean digresses in long passes blah blah
blah no narrative really unites these passages
blah blah blah blah blah
looking up defiantly
kaufman contd new york times book review
i cant structure this
its that sprawling new yorker shit
jerry gets distracted by another sexy woman walking by
id fuck her up the ass
theres no story
the book has no story
so make one up
the books a jumping off point
no one in town can make up a crazy story like you
youre the king
i didnt want to do that this time
its someone elses material
i have a responsibility
anyway i wanted to grow as a writer do something profound and simple
show people how amazing flowers are
are they amazing
i dont know
i think they are
look what i tell a lot of guys is pick another film and use it as a model
i always thought this one could be like apocalypse now
the journalist spends the whole movie searching for the crazy plant nut guy whats his name
she has to travel deep into the darkest swamps to find the mysterious laroche
i need you to get me out of this
charlie at the end of the day i think it would be a terrible career move
jumble of images laroche talking flowers indians orlean the trial
the rapid fire click click of typing
okay okay we open with laroche
okay he says okay he says i love to mutate plants he says mutation is fun
okay we show flowers and okay we have to have the court case
okay we show laroche okay he says i was mutated as baby thats why im so smart
okay we open at the beginning of time
no okay we open with laroche driving into the swamp
kaufman awakes with a start
enthusiastic off screen typing
kaufman peers through the darkness at the books papers coffee cups and dirty plates all around
black and white
its dark tangled with foliage and foreboding
two pioneers slog waist high through the water
alligators regard them menacingly
the pioneer adventurers in florida had to travel inward into a place as dark and dense as steel wool
they had to confront what a dark dense overabundant place might have hidden in it
the scene turns into color
the men turn into mannequins
the floor is covered with black cellophane representing swamp water
the swamp turns to cardboard with real orchids hanging from the trees
a guy carrying some orchids walks on top of the cellophane past the mannequins
the room is dark lit only by the light of the tv laroches father watches
laroche and orlean sit on the couch
the nursery was going well but sometimes bad things happen
laroche glances at his father who just stares at the tv
on the tv set are two framed photos one of laroches sister and one of laroches mother
laroche ushers his wife mother and uncle out of the house
his father watches tv
theres only a photo of laroches sister on the tv set now
sure you dont want to come dad
his father doesnt respond
they pile into a nice new american car his wife in front his mother and uncle in back
laroche pulls into traffic
nursery business good johnny
everythings good uncle jim
this last years been a dream im telling you
were finally pulling out of this debt
praise allah buddha vishnu
and all the rest of em
laroche smiles back at his mother
a screech of tires and another car crashes head on into theirs
laroches face smacks against the steering wheel his front teeth fly in all directions
his mother rockets forward smashing through the windshield
his uncle hits laroches wife in the head jerking her forward and landing on top of her
banged up and missing his front teeth laroche stands amidst a group of mourners at a double funeral
laroche in his mourning suit sits by his comatose wife
its a busy street full of discount cigarette stores
laroche and orlean step from his van head toward the store
she divorced me soon after she regained consciousness
then the hurricane destroyed my greenhouse
i knew it would break my heart to start another nursery so when the seminoles wanted a white guy an expert to get their nursery going i took it
laroche pulls about ten marlboro cartons off the shelf
but i wasnt gonna give them a conventional little potted plant place
so i came up with the ghost plan
i was gonna give them something amazing
kaufman beer in hand stands off in the corner of a room crowded with young hollywood types
he talks nervously to a pretty young woman see laroche researched it and found that indians have the legal right to take endangered plants off state lands
what an amazing opening
so then its a courtroom drama
a few good men
and all those indian rights issues are so complex
there are valid arguments on both sides
i mean we took their land
we gave them smallpox
well actually there wasnt much of a trial
florida got em on a technicality about cutting down non endangered trees
even the indians arent allowed to do that
they all plead no contest
laroche got fined five hundred bucks and banned from the fakahatchee for six months
so like then what happens
thats what i like
i mean most peoples lives dont include a lot of drama and i wanted to sort of be compelling without having to resort to big um
yknow what i mean
glancing distractedly around absolutely
i absolutely do
its like blake talked about seeing the world in a grain of sand and heaven in a wild flower
or like hegel
the woman smiles but shes somewhere else entirely
kaufman stares at his typewriter
theres a big pile of papers next to him
i am a failure
im a poseur
i have no ideas
i wanted to do something great
theres no story
im repuls the phone rings
sorry to bug you
we were just talking about you how excited we are
yeah me too
so its coming along good
its complicated what im trying to do but its going very well
orlean looks at a book called the native orchids of florida
she comes to a photo of the ghost orchid glowing white on the page
orleans husband walks by with a cup of coffee caresses her shoulder
she tenses slightly smiles up at him apologetically
he smiles back sadly
she returns to the photo
a line of text catches her eye should one be lucky enough to see a flower all else will seem eclipsed
orlean closes the book sits there
she dials the phone
so i was thinking itd be good for the article for me to go into the fakahatchee to see a ghost
would you take me
id love to but hey im banned for the next six months
goddamn crucified me
get one of them monkey suited rangers to take you
course they wouldnt be able to locate a ghost if it climbed off a tree and shoved itself up their ass
hey put that in the article
a hollow eyed kaufman is zipping up a suitcase
calling off screen travelling into the fakahatchee donald is a perfect metaphor for writing
im stepping into the confusion of the unknown
im taking the big risk here
donald types cheerily on a lap top computer at an ergonomic desk
kaufman descends the stairs with his suitcase
its dark dangerous as dense as steel wool
i dont know if ill come out alive but if i do ill have something true to give the world
thats the difference between writing and aping some morons principles
donald looks up from his work
he hasnt been listening
hey charles im thinking of putting a song in
yknow like when characters sing pop songs in their pajamas and dance around
i thought it might be a nice way to break the tension
so try to think of a song about split personality
orlean sits in her seat and addresses the camera
you would have to want something very badly
kaufman reads the orchid thief
to go looking for it in the fakahatchee strand
he cant concentrate closes the book and watches a stewardess tending to another passenger
kaufman fixes a salad in the kitchenette
the door opens and the stewardess enters dragging her luggage on a little cart
how was denver
oh god sweetie im so glad to be home
she kisses him looks lovingly at him
stewardess contd can i get you something to drink
kaufman finishes jerking off stands pulls up his pants adjusts himself and exits the bathroom
kaufman steps out of the bathroom
the stewardess is there talking to another stewardess
she regards kaufman blankly then goes back to her conversation
he heads up the aisle
one of the stewardesses laughs
he tenses takes his seat
orlean watches the hundreds of square miles of black wet florida swampland pass by below
an early surveyor made this entry in his field notes
a surveyor scribbles in a notebook
the pond is alive with alligators
a pond surrounded by bay and cypress swamp impracticable
full of monstrous alligators counted fifty and stopped
orlean lies in bed wide awake and anxious
whatever isnt wet in the fakahatchee is blasted
the grass gets so dry that the friction from a car can set it on fire and the burning grass can engulf the car in flames
a s botanist noted a botanist in a hot arid field writes in a notebook
most impressed by the areas variety of squirrels
a car drives by on the dirt road
it begins smoking
the driver jumps out of the car just as it bursts into flames
botanist contd and charred automobiles
we pull back to see the area filled with abandoned burned up old cars
kaufman watches the pretty clerk working on the computer
she looks up he looks down studies his road map
a charmingly bedraggled orlean drives on a road surrounded by swamp
she talks to us
the swamps darkness and denseness can rattle your nerves
a sailor on a pluma collecting expedition wrote in his diary a luggish sailor sits in the distance on a stump crying
the place looked wild and lonely
about three oclock it seemed to get on henrys nerves
we saw him crying he could not tell us why he was just plain scared
orlean drives onto the dirt road past the fakahatchee sign and talks to us
the swampy part of the fakahatchee is hot and wet and buggy and full of cottonmouth snakes and diamond back rattlers and
kaufman drives down the same road surrounded by swamp
alligators and snapping turtles and poisonous plants and wild hogs and
orlean gets out of the car knocks timidly on the shack door
ranger mike owen answers
its kaufman standing there
the sky is overcast
mike owen leads kaufman through a cool swamp which is completely dry
the two men walk easily on peaty ground
kaufman slathered with sun screen and covered head to foot in unnecessary protective clothing tries to be interested in owens lecture
so the whole ecosystem is six thousand years old
five to six thousand years old
five or six
now the fakahatchee is the largest of all the cyrpess strands probably in the world
i dont know of any cypress strand bigger
its about twenty miles long or nineteen nineteen to twenty nineteen
and right here its about five miles wide four and a half five
so again its twenty miles long three to five miles wide
and over here mike owen holds a handful of peat
kaufman looks at it
the oldest carbon dating theyve done on any of the peat out here is fifty seven hundred years
thats with carbon
mike owen contd thats in the right age where you can really date things accurately with carbon because its half life is fifty five hundred years so they must have
found have of it gone and figured that
why isnt it wet
orlean wrote about wading through black corrosive water
she said it was the scariest experience of her life
and when i spoke to you on the phone you said wear heavy boots long pants and
theres usually water
weve been going through a bit of a drought
say have you seen that movie medicine man
thats a good movie about protecting nature
it shows there could be something important in a rain forest we dont even know about like a cure for cancer
its not even hot
i was expecting it to be awful
sun beating down wading through water looking out for snakes wild hogs
i was thinking it would be dramatic
the alligators are over by the lakes
the temperatures a blessing for us
this time of year can get uncomfortably hot
pointing excitedly green anole
floridas most common
kaufman looks down and sees a plain looking little lizard hanging on a tree
mike owen jots it down in his notebook
mike owen contd i try to keep a log of sightings
mike owen drives
kaufman stares out the window at boring trees
it had been a hard day and i hadnt seen what id come to see
maybe the ghost orchid was a ghost after all
contd there are certainly ghosts in the fakahatchee ghosts of rangers who were murdered years ago by illegal plume hunters and of loggers who were cut to pieces in fights
and for years there has been an apparition wandering the swamp the swamp ape which is said to be seven feet tall and seven hundred pounds and have the physique of a human the posture of an ape and the body odor of a skunk
kaufman and owen stand by kaufmans car
what laroche did was wrong
those flowers belong to all of us all million of us
i think its up to now and belonging to all of us means they belong to none of us
nobody has a right to take them
not me not you not john laroche not
kaufman is desperate for something else
he blurts listen um susan orlean wrote about a legendary creature called a swamp ape
have you ever heard stories or pissy tourist garbage
i dont know why people need to invent silly creatures to make nature fascinating
isnt nature amazing enough
shamed i just asked because she mentioned it
orlean still dirty from the swamp holds a phone to her ear and talks to us
she has cute little dirt smudges on her face
that night i called laroche
into phone i didnt see anything but bare roots
orlean contd and i had this thought
maybe the ghost orchid only blooms in the minds of people whove walked too long in the swamp
its pouring and sheets of rain beat against her window
she glances at her husband across the room reading a book
she sighs continues typing
what i didnt say to him is that life seemed to be filled with things that were just like the ghost orchid wonderful to imagine and easy to fall in
love with but a little fantastic and fleeting and out of reach
kaufman drives down a florida strip malled highway
he passes a barnes and noble a burger king a starbucks
he parks in front of a california pizza kitchen
kaufman watches the waitresses
one approaches his booth
her name badge reads caryn tampa fl
she smiles at kaufman as she looks right through him
a morose kaufman sits on the bed reading the orchid thief
what i didnt say to him was that life seemed to be filled with things that were just like the ghost orchid wonderful to imagine and easy to fall in
love with but a little fantastic and fleeting and out of reach
kaufman is deeply moved
he hi lites the passage then looks at the smiling photo of orlean
he finds himself lost in it
orlean dirty from the swamp is on the phone
beat clears throat jesus christ of course there are ghost orchids out there
ive stolen them
laroche phone voice contd beat a cleared throat you should have gone with me
then he cleared his throat and said you should have gone with me
a really unique piece
busy lunch crowd
valerie sits at a table with orlean and an open new yorker magazine
thanks very much
were big fans
oh thank you
and laroche is such a fun character
yeah johns a character all right
its funny and fresh
and sad in a way
so we were wondering whats next
oh um random house wants me to expand it into a book
so ill be doing that
and therell be more of laroche
more john more orchids
yknow wed really like to option it
laughing you want to make this into a movie
laroche is such a fun character
laroche wearing a cleveland indians t shirt drives crazily thorugh the hollywood seminole reservation
orlean holds on
no shit im a fun character
beat whos gonna play me
ive got to write it first
someones gotta write the screenplay
most things never get made
its premature to i think i should play me
laroche swerves into a parking space in the nursery lot
laroche and orlean get out of the van
ive got all the right qualities
while you write ill take an acting class
a few young indian guys are hauling bags of potting soil
they look at laroche sourly
laroche indicates the giant cartoon indian on his t shirt
i wear this just to screw with em
laroche enters his office looks at some papers on his desk
most of them dont even bother calling me john anymore
its crazy white man now
laroche contd crazy white man is a good title for the movie
call the book crazy white man
or i dont know collector of hearts or something
before orlean can respond laroche picks up the phone and dials an impossibly long number
he waits gestures for orlean to sit on a chair piled high with junk
laroche contd you wont hurt anything
orlean moves the junk over shares the seat with it
laroche contd yelling into phone hello
this is john laroche from the seminole nursery
sem ih nole
to orlean how do you say seminole in spanish
into phone thats right yes
yeah i want to order some more of those pink string beans
pink string beans
yelling pink string beans
pink string beans
buster appears in the door
laroche contd into phone ill call back
hangs up hey buster
i was trying to order some pink string beans from argentina
i figure just because project ghost orchid is dead were not closing shop
well get into plant multiplication
buy little ones turn em into big ones sell em at a profit
simple plant multiplication for the masses
john were thinking maybe nows a good time for you to take a few weeks
i dont need a vacation buster
its a good time
things are slow
laroche stares at buster
buster stares back
yknow the guys on my crew here all they do is smoke weed all day
i been meaning to talk to you about that
so if its a question of productivity laroche weaves through traffic
orlean holds on
theyre gonna fire me
crazy white mans bad publicity
pounds steering wheel i cant believe im dealing with this
pounds steering wheel like i could give a damn
if they fire me ill sue
i already did some legal research on this when i was doing the other shit
they cant fire me
and i aint going to quit
kaufman drives his rental car he looks at the seminole nursery the collier county courthouse laroches house
he drives through swampy terrain
he walks around at an orchid show he attends a slide show orchid lecture
its all dull
he ends up sitting on a bench on an empty beach staring out at the ocean
orlean dials the phone
it rings for a long time
john its susan
waits for response orlean
waits so i was just wondering if you might be willing to talk some more
orlean rolls her eyes
cmon john im trying to put together a book
dont just abandon me down here
im no longer interested in orchids
im pursuing other avenues
i apologize for any inconvenience this might cause you
orlean is silent taps her fingers on the bedside table
thank you for your time
laroche hangs up
orlean sits there for a moment flips through her list of orchid collector names
kaufman sits on the bench looking out at the ocean
an attractive spandexed couple skate by chatting in german
he watches the woman hoping for a look for something
he doesnt get it
a tan older man sits on the bench lights a cigarette
kaufman continues to look at the ocean even though he feels the guys eyes on him
he doesnt want to engage
we could use the rain huh
kaufman nods looking at the ocean
guy on bench contd so you from around here
kaufman shakes his head no
guy on bench contd so where then
im moving to l
i just wrote a screenplay
i sent it to a lot of agents
but if they turn me down ill go there and market it myself
i used to be in marketing in new york so i know exactly how to sell this thing
beat wheres a nice place to live if you dont have a car
you kind of need a car
i guess west hollywood would be okay
so you recommend west hollywood then
im not recommending it
i moved down here for a change and i wrote the screenplay
just like that
its a great idea
the old guy waits for a response
he gets none
guy on bench contd its about a mob guy but its not your regular mob story
theres a twist
a cop tells this mob guys wife that the mob guys cheating on her
but the truth is the cops lying because he wants her for himself
see they used to go together in high school
waits for response then you know anything about screenplays
kaufman shakes his head
guy on bench contd well the object is to make people think youre going in one direction then you twist it to keep em surprised
i came up with all these amazing twists out of nowhere
well not nowhere
beat im a born again christian
beat you have faith
you dont believe in anything
guy on bench contd i dont know how you can look out at this beautiful ocean and not believe theres an intelligence that created it
i dont know
well you cant know until you experience it
that requires accepting jesus christ as your lord and savior
lookit if i was to show you a bottle of clear liquid and told you it was vodka how would you know if it really was or if it was
theres only one way
id smell it
you cant smell vodka
youd have to taste it right
it could be poison
i dont know you
angry look lets go with the analogy im drawing here
its not poison
guy on bench contd so youd have to taste it to know
thats my point
thats all im saying
beat so west hollywood huh
i think ill make it out this year
because how long can you look at an ocean yknow
susan orlean talks to various orchid enthusiasts visits nurseries sits in lecture halls attends orchid shows sits in the library reading orchid books
she is bored and distracted
a stewardess places a cup and an airline sized bottle of vodka down in front of a lost kaufman
he smiles at her
he opens the bottle and smells the vodka
kaufman sits in the back seat and stares out the window
the driver looks at him a couple of times in his rearview mirror
i have failed
i have nothing to say
i am fat
i am not a writer
kaufman do you mind if i ask what type of work you do for sony
im a writer
impressed a song writer
no im a screenwriter
good for you
you mind if i ask what your movies about
its about flowers
kaufman tries to make it interesting
kaufman contd its about this poacher who steals orchids out of a swamp
i heard about that
drug flowers right
i heard about that
action adventure is my favorite genre
kaufman enters with his bags and heads to the stairs
donald typing furiously at his desk looks up
how was florida man
climbing the stairs okay
hey my scripts going amazing
right now im working out an image system
bob calls it an invaluable asset
because of my multiple personality theme ive chosen the motif of broken mirrors to show my protagonists fragmented self
bob teaches that an image system greatly increases the complexity of an aesthetic emotion
you sound like youre in a cult
kaufman disappears upstairs
no its just good writing technique
donald contd oh i made you a copy of mckees ten commandments
ive posted one over both our work areas
kaufman tears down mckees ten commandments
donald appears backlit in the doorway and seems oddly threatening
you shouldnt have done that
they look at each other
donald breaks the tension smiles
donald contd cause its extremely helpful
lies down on floor hey any sign of that swamp ape
there is no swamp ape
it was invented for people who cant find the actual world fascinating
i didnt know that
hey i got a song
i was worried about putting a song in a thriller but bob says casablanca the greatest screenplay ever written did exactly that
i need to go to bed donald
i havent slept in a week
donald remains on the floor
mishmash of images alligators snapping laroche jabbering orlean typing th century orchid poachers slogging orchids blooming mike owen lecturing
so we open the swamp
okay flashback to young laroche had turtles
okay susan says what is passion
and okay we open on a swamp and suddenly a white van comes tearing around
kaufman lies half awake in bed sweating his eyes darting back and forth
he looks over at the clock
donald snores happily off screen
kaufman switches on a lamp pulls the orchid thief from his bag flips through it
there are now many yellow hi lited passages
he reads one
there are too many ideas and things and people too many directions to go
i was starting to believe the reason it matters to care passionately about something is that it whittles the world down to a more manageable size
such sweet sad insights
kaufman flips to the glowing smiling author photo
i like looking at you
he stares at the photo
its smile broadens
i like looking at you too
the photo smiles warmly at him
kaufman begins to jerk off
he closes his eyes
then kaufman and orlean are in his bed together making love
she smiles at him throughout
then kaufman is alone in bed heaving
he looks at the still smiling photo
it somehow seems sleepy now
i dont know how to do this
im afraid ill disappoint you
youve written a beautiful book
i cant sleep
im losing my hair
im fat and repulsive shhh
whittle it down focus on one thing in the story find the thing you care passionately about and write about that
kaufman studies her delicate melancholy face
hes in love
orlean photo contd sweet flirty smile i figured there might be something
kaufman paces and talks animatedly into his mini recorder
we see susan orlean delicate fragile beautiful haunted by loneliness typing at her desk
she looks at the camera and talks to us john laroche is a tall guy skinny as a stick pale eyed slouch shouldered
donald enters in his underwear pours coffee
you seem chipper
i have some new ideas
im putting in a chase sequence now
the killer flees on horseback with the girl
the cop is after them on a motorcycle
its like a battle between motors and horses
theyre all still one person right
yeah hey thats the big pay off
nice well it sounds exciting
orlean drives through swampy landscape
she talks to us
i suppose what id been doing in florida was trying to understand how people found order and contentment and a sense of purpose in the universe by fixing their sighs
on one single desire
now i was also trying to understand how someone could end such intense desire without a trace
orlean stops at a payphone and dials
it rings for a while
groggy yeah what
hello john its susan
so hows everything going
im training myself on the internet
im doing pornography
its amazing how much these suckers will pay for photographs of chicks
and it doesnt matter if theyre fat or ugly or what
that sounds good
its great is what it is
so ive been meeting a lot of orchid people going to shows i thought you might want to hear about it
i am officially no longer interested in orchids or the losers who are still interested in them
laroche hangs up
orlean looks off into the flat distance
if you really loved something wouldnt a little of it always linger
she turns to the camera
kaufman holds the orchid thief open with one hand and types with the other
susan orlean drives
the golden light of the afternoon sun caresses her sweet face
she talks to us
copying from book florida is a landscape of transition and mutation a hybrid of
kaufmans hand slips the book shuts
he opens it to the wrong page and sees an about the author paragraph
the last line jumps off the page she now lives in new york city with her husband
kaufman wanders the street distraught
a passing woman snickers
susan and her husband eat dinner in silence
a dying relationship
husband you want to do something tonight
susan i should work
i got stuff
kaufman and orlean move furniture into the room
it now looks warm and inviting
orlean wears a bandana kerchief
im so thrilled i get to adapt your book get to merge my thoughts with yours
i love that
its intimate like a marriage
not like a marriage
maybe what marriage could be
her eyes tear up
she kisses him
isnt it ironic
you adapting my book
my three years in florida meditating on my inability to experience passion resulted in my finding it with you
kaufman paces with his mini recorder
off screen typing
and in the final sequence susan as a young girl swings alone in the backyard
from high in the air she sees her parents in separate rooms staring blankly in opposite directions
this symbolizes the profound scarring their waning passion has had on the girls psyche how she became afraid to ever really love something because it would go away
kaufman is immensely pleased
he smiles at orleans photo
kaufman contd this is good
im finding you
the phone rings
just bugging you again
hows everything going
i think really good now
so i spoke to susan yesterday
uh huh uh huh
i told her you were making terrific progress and shes really excited to read the script
sweat appears on kaufmans brow
and she said shed love to meet you
all color drains from kaufmans face
um well yknow for me its distracting to
or confusing to discuss what im exploring in the screenplay at this point
before i finish
ill let her know
tell susan id be very happy to meet her at a future date
as she sees fit
and tell her how much i love her book
say i think shes such a great writer
valerie contd will do
just keep us posted charlie
nice talking to you
kaufman hangs up and looks at the photo of orlean
its still smiling but not at him
its not glowing
maybe its even smirking
kaufman paces frantically holding his stomach
donalds off screen typing grows louder
donald types at his desk on his computer
kaufman storms in
you can sit here and pretend to be a writer mocking the seriousness of what i do like some kind of fucking funhouse mirror version of me
but let me tell you you dont know what writing is
kaufman grabs his stomach doubles over
kaufman is on a gurney and hooked up to an iv
he watches a slightly haggard woman with a bandaged head sitting in a small room across the hall
she glances over in his direction
she looks through him
she thinks im repulsive
he lies there for a moment then his eyes light up
kaufman types passionately on his computer
charlie kaufman fat old bald paces the room
his voice over carpets the scene
i am old
i am fat
i am bald
my toenails have turned strange
i am repulsive
i dont know for i suffer from a condition called body dysmorphic disorder
kaufman looking tired and wild eyed sits with his agent
we need to talk about the orchid script
valerie called yesterday
theyre getting antsy
i think ive got it on track now
she said you sounded weird
no hollywood bullshit
just raw truth
sometimes that takes a while to find
whats the time frame here
its goddamned honest jerry
oh hey my friend sent me this fucked up internet thing
its a girl taking a shit but a trout comes out
you got e mail yet
ill send it to you
this is more honest than anything anyones ever done before in a movie ill tell you that
the only truth we can offer is the truth thats our own experience of the world
the great poet in writing himself writes his time
it sounds good buddy
but we do need to give valerie a ballpark im sick of their constant harassment
black and white shot of laroche and the indians slogging through fakahatchee
the camera swoops down and the scene turns into a mannequin version
on december john laroche and three seminoles illegally removed one hundred and thirty rare plants from the fakahatchee strand state preserve
its an enormous hall filled with people setting up elaborate displays
martin motes and his assistant work on the laroche display
orlean watches them
motes looks up
youve been checking out the displays
its the miami centennial were supposed to illustrate something about florida history
now laroche is part of florida history
as a mannequin
its a world of words to the end of it
in which nothing solid is its solid self
youll have to forgive me im a reformed poetry professor
orlean is moved by the quote
who is that
orlean stands in the poetry section and reads a wallace stevens book
the greatest poverty is not to live in a physical world to feel that ones desire is too difficult to tell from despair
kaufman is on the floor typing
his mini recorder is on
kaufman sits across from valerie a pretty film executive
he eyes her as she picks at her salad
she looks up and he looks down
she compliments him on his work
she rubs her nose
he pulls at his nostrils
he tries to sound like he knows what hes talking about
hes full of shit
orlean dials the phone
john its susan
i went to the orchid society show a couple of days ago
im not interested
there was a display of you stealing the ghost orchids
im not involved in that world now
so look john i still havent seen a ghost
and i was wondering yeah yeah
ill take you in
thank you so much
pick me up at am or itll get too hot
ill buy all the supplies well need
kaufman jerks off to the book jacket photo of susan orlean
donald appears in the doorway with a script
what do you want
kaufman stares at his typewriter doesnt say anything
donald contd so would you show it to your agent
kaufman grabs donalds script and throws it on his bed
donald contd thanks
also i wanted to thank you for your idea
it was very helpful
i changed it a little
now the killer cuts off body pieces and makes the victims eat them
its like i once saw this picture of a snake swallowing its tail kaufman collapses puts his head in his hands
i dont know what that means
the snake is called ourobouros
i dont think so
but its cool for my killer to have this modus operandi
because at the end when he forces the woman whos really just him to eat herself hes also eating himself to death
i dont know what that is
ive written myself into my screenplay
its eating itself
im eating myself
thats kinda weird
its self indulgent
im fat and pathetic
im sure you had a good reason charles
youre an artist
the reason is im too timid to speak to the woman who wrote the book
because im pathetic
because i have no idea how to write
because i cant make flowers fascinating
because i suck
hey am i in the script too
im going to new york
ill meet her
thats what i have to do
dont get mad at me for saying this charles but bobs got a seminar in new york this weekend
so if youre stuck kaufman shoots donald a look
the lights are off
orlean is in bed sleeping fitfully
kaufman reads ann landerss column in a paper dated july th
give yourself a reality check
phoniness is transparent and it is tiresome
take pleasure in the beauty and wonders of nature
a flower is gods miracle
out the window he sees colorful fireworks far down below like small flowers blooming on the black earth
his eyes well with tears
kaufman sleeps fitfully
orlean walks through alone panicked
all the vegetation is greener and crazier looking than weve seen before
things slither by in the water brush up against her
she tenses steps into a sinkhole flails gets tangled in a vine which wraps around her leg as she attempts to extricate herself
she falls face forward into the black water
orlean snaps awake bedcovers tangled around her legs
she heaves looks at the clock
she stares at the ceiling
she looks at the clock again
she looks at the clock again
she closes her eyes
she opens them looks at the clock the room is filled with murky water the bed an island of dryness
an alligator pokes its nose out of the water begins to climb onto the bed
orlean jumps back hits her head on the headboard
the room is back to normal
the clock reads
she closes her eyes
the alarm goes off
orlean pulls up to the curb where laroche stands dressed in a short sleeve shirt thin pants and his miami hurricanes hat
he opens the door and climbs in
where are our supplies
got everything i need right here
laroche pulls a new pack of cigarettes out of his pocket
orlean turns off the ignition and stares at the steering wheel
laroche contd look dont worry about it
well get crap at the indian trading post on alligator alley
hey want me to drive
the sun has come up strong
it looks hot
laroche speeds along with one finger on the wheel paying little attention to the road
the car veers onto the shoulder he lazily corrects it
orlean is tense
i remember one time when i was a kid fifteen or so my mother and i came to the fakahatchee to look for a ghost to photograph
we walked for hours through the most intense heat id ever felt
we couldnt find one
i wanted to turn back
but my mom said no
laroche contd she said john if you keep searching for something past doubt past hopelessness past the absolute certainty that youll never find it if you keep searching past that
there itll be
so we walked
i had goddamn bloody blisters on my feet
and we found ourselves in this charred prairie desolate sun blasted yknow
and there in the middle of it was this one gorgeous snowy polyrrhiza lindenii
they drive in silence for a little while
she watches him
orlean types at her desk
she turns to us and talks
he made it sound like a bible story the hopeful journey through darkness into light
i never thought many people in the world were like john but i was realizing more and more that laroche was an extreme not an aberration most people in some
way or another do strive for something exceptional something to pursue even at their peril rather than abide an ordinary life
kaufman sweaty and anxious walks along
he arrives at the new yorker building and enters with steely determination
kaufman waits for the elevator sweating even more profusely
the elevator doors open
people get off people get on the elevator doors close
kaufman still stands there
laroche and orlean step off the levee into black water
they sink to their knees
the ground is soft its a struggle to pull their feet up to walk
things slither past in the water
something big runs by in the distance
bees and dragonflies hover
gnats and mosquitoes bite
laroche points to a yellow flower
here we go
laroche lights a cigarette
laroche contd nice little sucker isnt it
orlean examines it from a distance
laroche continues walking and orlean attempts to keep pace
he points at a tiny orchid on another tree
you know that
see i found you two already
ill show you every orchid you want today
ill find you a fucking ghost if it kills me
pointing to another orchid rigid epidendrum
thats an ugly ass orchid
but im no snob
im interested in all orchids
not just pretty ones
a miserable kaufman sits in the window sipping coffee and watching the new yorker building across the street
he steels himself exits the coffee shop
kaufman rides up in the crowded elevator
it stops a few times people get off and on
the doors open
the new yorker logo is painted on the wall opposite the elevator
nobody gets off or on
the doors close
the elevator continues up
kaufman hates himself
soon the elevator is emptied out with the exception of kaufman
it begins its descent and stops once again at the new yorker
this time orlean gets on
kaufman is absolutely panicked
orlean looks at him blankly presses lobby and faces front
kaufman sweats studies the back of her head
the elevator arrives at the lobby
orlean gets out
kaufman hesitates then follows
orlean walks along
kaufman follows her
the sun is much higher in the sky
orlean is a sweaty mess frizzed hair anxious scraped dirty
peppy theyre right nearby
just follow me
orlean sits by herself reading vanity fair
kaufman sits a few tables away
he scribbles in his notebook
reads vanity fair
funny detail new yorker writer reads vanity fair
a waitress brings a tuna sandwich and an ice tea to orlean
contd likes tuna drinks ice tea
good character details
orlean looks up from her magazine and smiles at the waitress
could i get some lemon please
the waitress nods and leaves
likes lemon in tea and her voice is not at all what i imagined
orlean follows laroche
she watches him start off in one direction stop start off another direction then go straight ahead
orlean seems depressed
laroche can i ask you a personal question
laroche turns and scowls at her
were not lost
orlean window shops at a shoe store
kaufman takes notes
eyeing stuart weitzman pumps
orlean heads down the street
she enters the new yorker building
kaufman waits outside
the sun is hot
laroche is twenty feet ahead of orlean
she watches him march forward with great authority
she massages her eyebrows leaving a residue of dirt on her face
kaufman reviews his notes
he is sweaty and wild eyed
i have nothing
i am nothing
i am fat
i am over
i am lost
the sun is high
orlean and laroche sit on dry ground
she stares at him
laroche wont look at her
he busies himself opening the backpack and pulling out food
finally laroche speaks without looking up
were not lost
laroche takes out a cigarette lights it
laroche contd im just turned around a little
he looks up at her sees her staring at him
he pokes around on the ground for something comes up with a straight twig
laroche contd a sundial
ill just set this up wait a few minutes and well be able to tell which way the sun is moving
we want to be heading southeast
laroche sticks the twig into the ground stares at it
laroche contd this is no big deal
you should eat something
orlean takes a cracker
this relaxes laroche
he stretches his legs knocks over the twig
without looking at orlean he puts the twig back
laroche contd so do you collect anything
non responsive not really
well yknow its not really about collecting the thing its about the sundial isnt working
laroche looks down at it
it is so working
orlean stares at the twig in the ground
she looks at laroche
laroche smiles sheepishly at orlean
rage and panic sweep across her face her fists clench into balls
her eyes become wild some dark fantasy plays out in her brain
laroche seems unaware
laroche contd the thing about computers
the thing i like is that im immersed in it but its not a living thing thats going to leave or die or something
i prefer having the minimum number of living things to worry about in my life
orleans anger softens
she looks sadly at laroche
okay fuck the sundial
well just go straight and eventually well get there
laroche contd what i mean is well get somewhere
out of here
i mean logically we have to get out as long as we walk straight
laroche points them in a direction and they walk
kaufman is sleeping
it looks like its been a rough night
the phone rings
he reaches for it
hey its jerry
i woke you
no its okay
hows it going
has it been helpful to talk to the writer
whats her name
well i mean are you making headway
valeries breathing down my neck
you cant rush inspiration
um the other reason im calling is to tell you me myself and i is just amazing
what the hell is me myself and i
your brothers script
its tight inventive
a smart edgy thriller
the best spec script ive read this year
im gonna sell it for a shitload
two fucking talented guys in one family
yknow maybe you could bring donald on to help you finish the orchid thing
jerry dont say that
just a thought buddy
hes really goddamn amazing at structure
jerry i gotta go
i have an appointment
i gotta go
he eyes other sad looking balding overweight men wandering the streets also
i am fat
i cant write
i am repulsive
i am old
i have accomplished nothing
i am just one more old fat bald man on the street
laroche leads the way
theres a sadness a sense of defeat and humiliation that he tries to conceal
orlean is stony
ive done this a million times
whenever everythings killing me i just say to myself screw it and go straight ahead
laroche leads orlean back into the brush
kaufman sees a white school building ahead glowing in the sun
he walks toward it
the lobby of an auditorium crowded with enthusiastic people signing up for something
kaufman waits in line
he watches the handsome guy ahead of him flirt with an attractive female registrar
the guy moves on and the attractive registrar looks without interest at kaufman
may i help you
kaufman averts his eyes from her cool gaze they come to rest on a pile of mckees book story next to her
kaufman sits in the packed room
mckee paces the stage with a mic clipped to his lapel
years from now youll be standing around a posh cocktail party congratulating yourself on how you spent an entire weekend locked in a room with an asshole an opinionated arrogant
asshole for your art
the audience laughs except for kaufman who looks pained
i am pathetic
i am a loser
i am fat
what is the substance of writing
nothing as trivial as words is at the heart of this great art my friends
mckee continues to talk but his voice goes under
i have failed
i am panicked
i am fat
i have sold out
i am worthless
literary talent is not enough
first last and always the imperative is to tell a story
kaufman watches with disdain as people take notes
twenty three hundred years ago aristotle said when storytelling goes bad in a society the result is decadence
deadpan well just look around you
everyone except kaufman laughs giddily at mckees joke
mckee contd aristotle also said a story must have a beginning a middle and an end
the students nod in appreciation at this profundity
mckee scribbles a diagram onto a transparency in an overhead projector
its some kind of complicated time line with act breaks and corresponding page numbers indicated
the audience members take copious notes
it is my weakness my ultimate lack of conviction that brings me here with all these desperate idiots lapping up everything this bag of wind spouts
rules to short cut yourself to success
and here i am because my jaunt into the abyss brought me nothing
well isnt that the risk one takes for attempting something new
i should leave here right now
ill start over starts to rise i need to face this project head on and and god help you if you use voice over in your work my friends
kaufman stops looks up startled
mckee seems to be looking at him
god fucking help you
its flaccid sloppy writing
any idiot can write voice over narration to explain the thoughts of a character
you must present the internal conflicts of your character in image in symbol
film is a medium of movement and image
kaufman looks around at people scribbling in notebooks
writes the guy on one side of him
writes the guy on the other side
mckee contd okay one hour for lunch
students exit onto the street in small groups
kaufman wanders by himself
his face is troubled
there is no sound
kaufman sits and listens
a copy of aristotles poetics sits on his lap
the book features a bust of aristotle on the cover
you want your writing to be original
you want to have an original voice like neil simon or nora ephron
well let me tell you something my friends
the key to originality is not eccentricity
a guy behind kaufman gives an appreciative mmmm
the audience is tired but still attentive
now kaufman takes serious notes
mckee energetic as ever wears his sweater tied around his shoulders
we stay firmly planted on his face as he talks and talks
long speechs are antithetical to the nature of cinema
the greeks called it stykomythia the rapid exchange of ideas
a long speech in a script say a page long requires that the camera hold on the actors face for a minute
look at the second hand on your watch as it makes one complete rotation around the clock face and youll get an idea of how intolerable that would be for
the ontology of the screen is that its always now and its always action and its always vivid
life is rarely vivid
and thats an important point
we are not recreating life on the screen
writers are not tape recorders
have you ever eavesdropped on people talking in a coffee shop
then you know how dull and tedious real conversation is
real people are not interesting
theres not a person in this world and i include myself in this who would be interesting enough to take as is and put in a movie as a character
mckee faces the audience holding a cup of coffee
someone asked me recently bob do you think michelle pfeiffer is pretty
he pauses theatrically sips his coffee then mckee contd deadpan michelle pfeiffer is proof my friends that theres a fucking god
the overtired audience breaks into uproarious laughter
kaufman with dark circles under his eyes giggles a little
mckee contd okay
thats it for tonight
remember therell be a q and a tomorrow morning before class starts
kaufman tosses and turns in bed
the daguerreotype darwin the aristotle sculpture the hegel engraving and the orlean book jacket photo are alive and in the middle of brutal and bloody fist fight
kaufman bleary eyed sits in the back
kaufman timidly raises his hand
mckee contd yes
you talked about crisis as the ultimate decision a character makes but what if a writer is attempting to create a story where nothing much happens where people dont change
they dont have any epiphanies
they struggle and are frustrated and nothing is resolved
more a reflection of the real world the real world
the real fucking world
first of all if you write a screenplay without conflict or crisis youll bore your audience to tears
secondly nothing happens in the real world
are you out of your fucking mind
people are murdered every day
theres genocide and war and corruption
every fucking day somewhere in the world somebody sacrifices his life to save someone else
every fucking day someone somewhere makes a conscious decision to destroy someone else
people find love
people lose it for christs sake
a child watches her mother beaten to death on the steps of a church
someone goes hungry
somebody else betrays his best friend for a woman
if you cant find that stuff in life then you my friend dont know much about life
and why the fuck are you taking up my precious two hours with your movie
i dont have any use for it
i dont have any bloody use for it
the last of the students are filing out
kaufman waits leaning against the building
mckee emerges carrying his brown leather bag
a shaky tired kaufman approaches him
im the guy you yelled at this morning
trying to recall i need more
i was the one who thought things didnt happen in life
oh right okay
nice to see you
i need to talk
i make it a rule not to give private tutorials to my seminar students
it wouldnt be fair to the others
my even standing here is very scary
i dont meet people well
im self conscious and timid
but what you said this morning shook me to the bone
what you said was bigger than my screenwriting choices
its about my choices as a human being
mckee hesitates for a moment then reaches out and puts his arm around kaufman
i could use a drink my friend
laroche and orlean slog through the water with purpose looking only straight ahead
as they walk the sounds and colors become subdued
soon there is silence
we turned to the right and saw only more cypress and palm and sawgrass they turn left and see metal flashing in the sunlight
contd so we turned to the left and there far down the diagonal of the levee we could see the gleam of a fender
we followed it like a beacon all the way to the road
orlean and laroche walk toward the car
kaufman and mckee sit at a table with beers
kaufman reads from his copy of the orchid thief
we followed it like a beacon all the way to the road
kaufman closes the book
theres a pause
then what happens
thats the book
i wanted to present it simply without big character arcs or sensationalizing the story
i wanted to show flowers as gods miracles
i wanted to show that orlean never saw the blooming ghost orchid
its about disappointment
thats not a movie
you must go back and put in the drama
pause ive got pages of false starts and wrong approaches
im way past my deadline
i cant go back
ah the everpresent deadline
yes i was doing a kojak once and
it was hell
mckee sips his beer eyes kaufman
mckee contd tell you a secret
the last act makes the film
you can have an uninvolving tedious movie but wow them at the end and youve got a hit
find an ending
use what youve learned this weekend
give them that and youll be fine
tears form in kaufmans eyes
kaufman hugs him
mckee recognizes his bulk
youve taken my course before
my brother did
my twin brother donald
hes the one who got me to come
julius and philip epstein who wrote casablanca were twins
you mentioned that in class
the finest screenplay ever written
a drunken kaufman paces tries to read story
mckees ten commandments are taped to the wall
as is a photo of michelle pfeiffer ripped from a magazine
a revolution in values from positive to negative or negative to positive with or without irony a value swing at maximum charge thats absolute and irreversible
kaufman is lost
he rubs his temples
he dials the phone
great writers residence
hey hows the trip
gettin it on with that lady journalist
you dog you
listen im calling to say congratulations on your script
isnt that cool
jerry says he can make me like high sixes against a mill five
thats great donald
i want to thank you for all your help
i wasnt any help
cmon you let me stay in your place and your integrity inspired me to even try
well look ive been thinking maybe youd be interested in hanging out with me in new york for a few days
oh my god yes
donald lies on his back on the floor intently reading the script
donald finishes is quiet
so like what would you do
script kind of makes fun of me huh
i was trying something
i hey i dont mind
so what would you do
you and me are so different charles
were different talents
just for fun
how would the great donald end this script
giggling the great donald
serious well i mean
do you need the whole court case
uh its what happened to laroche
its kind of important
a courtroom scene should be dramatic
stick the ruling in a line of dialogue maybe
too much about orchids
get rid of it
pare that stuff down to a minimum
frankly id focus more on the relationship between the brothers
i think thats the gold here
no one cares about orchids
the books about orchids
thats a problem
but dont let it ruin the movie
i mean for example use the orchids in a more dramatic way
have some kind of bang up crazy action sequence in the swamp
use the swamp better
its a tremendous fictional world
a setting of great dramatic possibility
but and put some twists in
reveal some surprising thing about laroche
god what am i doing giving suggestions to you
i mean youre like a seasoned professional
youre an artist
cmon youre the mill five kid
enjoying this shut up
thinks i love the laroche porno web site stuff
is that real
maybe make a bigger deal of that
i dont know
i think its real
i havent actually seen the site
its sex man
the front door opens and kaufman enters
the lights are off but the room is aglow with light from donalds laptop computer
kaufman sees a silhouetted donald masturbating in front of the computer
donald looks up caught
oh hi i was doing some research
i found laroches site and
kaufman passes donald glances at the grainy nude on the screen
its orlean smiling at him
shes kinda cute
you dont like her
i dunno i think shes okay
its not like im marrying her
kaufman shows donald orleans book jacket photo
donald contd oh wow
thats kind of a twist huh
i think this is maybe a good thing for the script
go ask her about this
im not gonna ask her about this
you want me to
i dont mind
no i dont want you to
i could easily pretend im you
donald dressed like kaufman waits by the elevators
hes about to talk to her when she pulls out a cell phone and dials
donald decides to be a spy and follows her out of the building
orlean talks on the phone
donald trails close behind her
so youll pick me up
orlean stops to look in a shoe store window
donald stops and looks in the window also
orlean doesnt notice him
orlean contd ten twenty
yes of course i will
donald walks off
donald is focused on the computer
kaufman sits in a chair in the corner
both men are in pajamas
what was she wearing
i dont know
like a dress maybe
did she look at me
da da da daaaaah
orlean twa flight
arriving miami tomorrow morning
donald turns and smiles across the room to kaufman
i dont want to do this donald
well go together
itll be good
kaufman looks squeamish
donald picks up a hairbrush holds it to his mouth
he starts to sing happy together
kaufman smiles sheepishly shrugs donald off
finally kaufman joins in
they do the whole number and fall laughing into each others arms
orlean waits with a suitcase outside the terminal
the beat up white van pulls up
orlean gets in the van speeds off
another car pulls away from the curb and follows it
donald drives keeping up with the van which speeds and swerves through traffic
kaufman is sweaty nervous
its so weird to actually see that van in real life
so you want to build the symbolic charge of the storys imagery from the particular to the universal
okay but when youre creating an image system how do you know the van pulls into the driveway of a neat middle class house
kaufman and donald drive by in time to see orlean and laroche emerge from the van
orlean seems different now more exotic
shes wearing some kind of sexy sarong
donald drives up the street parks gets out of the car and watches as laroche lugs orleans suitcase into the house
ill get a closer look
you wait here
momentously no i want to go
i should go
i mean it should be me right
go for it bro
you the man
kaufman gets out of the car
donald gets in peruses kaufmans script
kaufman walks past the house trying to peer in windows
he sees nothing
he slinks around back
in the yard kaufman finds a greenhouse
its filled with row upon row of ghost orchids
theres movement in a window in the house
darlin i dunno whats come over you
kaufman crawls over to the house lifts his face to the window
orlean and laroche are laughing kissing groping and undressing each other
kaufman is heartbroken but transfixed
suddenly laroche locks eyes with kaufman
dont stop johnny
laroche jumps up and runs naked to the back door
where are you going
kaufman makes a mad dash around the side of the house
laroche cuts him off grabs him drags him into the house
laroche throws kaufman down into a chair
the chair slides across the floor tips over
orlean seems uninterested
she kisses laroches leg
who the hell are you
kaufman notices laroche has a set of beautiful white teeth
nobody i just laroche shakes orlean off his leg kicks kaufman in the gut
who the fuck are you
i was at the wrong house
im looking for the johnson family
i got your johnson family right here
laroche kicks kaufman in the head
orlean kisses laroches back
honey come back to bed
who the hell sent you
im not again laroche kicks kaufman in the head
his scalp bleeds
kaufman contd im the screenwriter
what the fuck does that mean
im the guy adapting her book
her book about you
this registers with laroche
jesus fucking christ
then trying to make sense why the fuck were you in my backyard
i was um trying
i dont know
orlean is unforgiving
whos the bloody fat guy
this is the fellow adapting your book for the movies darling
i wanted to meet realizing oh
what does he know
i dont know anything
he knows about the greenhouse
to orlean we cant have this appear on the silver screen
i dont even under johnny im so tired now
orlean lies down
donald peers unseen into the back window
he needs to be gotten rid of
donalds eyes widen
orlean watches laroche fascinated by his every muscle movement
small article in newspaper
orlean snaps out of her muscle fixation becomes fixated on his voice his lips
laroche contd screenwriter doing research for movie about notorious orchid poacher was found drowned in the fakahatchee after accidentally slipping and hitting his head on a rock
end of story
is that credible from a journalistic standpoint
johnny come lie on top of me
is this credible
concentrates um oh
this screenwriter was killed doing research in jamaica a few years ago
to kaufman screenwriter you have a car
i um no i laroche gets ready to kick him again
kaufman contd a rental a rental
we drive his car there leave it on the side of the swamp
i like that
to kaufman sorry
donald disappears from the window
the headlights shine on laroches van ahead
orlean no longer stoned sits next to him holding a gun
she skims kaufmans screenplay
i thought i had a sense of you from your book
beat i had a little crush on you to tell the truth
youre different than i thought
look i dont care what you two are you doing
please dont kill me
hey heres one of my lines
mockingly reading from screen isnt it ironic
you adapting my book
my three years in florida meditating on my inability to experience passion resulted in my finding it with you
i was trying to do something
well its kind of pathetic dontcha think
they drive in silence
orlean reads more of the screenplay
heres me again
mocking i wanted to know what its like to care about something passionately
orlean laughs derisively
you can laugh but i didnt make that line up
thats a quote from your book
yeah i know charlie boy
im laughing at who i used to be
so now you learned about passion
jealous from weirdo laroche
bully for you
you cant learn about passion
you can be passion
and it wasnt john who made me passion
it was orchids
i thought you didnt even like orchids
i lied about what happened at the end of the book
on the way out of the swamp
laroche leads orlean through the swamp
he spots something on a tree circles it and stands there awestruck
orlean comes around and sees a beautiful ghost orchid hanging from the tree
the jewel of the fakahatchee
orlean looks at it tries to feel some passion for it cant
i still dont get it
i mean there it is
i can see its pretty but youll get it
laroche pulls a saw from his bag and cuts the branch
theres a makeshift lab
laroche is extracting some gooey substance from the nectary
back in johns basement he explained his real plans for the ghost
hed discovered a chemical inside with psychoactive properties
his plan had always been to clone the flower and make a fortune marketing this drug
it was laroches kind of plan it wasnt a controlled substance because the government didnt know it existed
orlean nervously snorts some green powder off the coffee table while laroche watches
she talks to the camera
the first time i tried it the split second it took effect i understood orchids
i loved them with a passion id never felt for anything
the drug takes effect and orlean turns away from us becomes fixated on the ghost orchid sitting on the table before her
she smells it caresses it cries at its beauty
isnt it curious
an orchid made me passionate about orchids
youre throwing the truth away for a chemical confusion of your synapses with this powder i am passionate about everything
orlean contd im alive in a profound world now
it sizzles with beauty and horror and sex
now writing is words are a way to remove yourself from passion
so im done with writing
john and i are making a fortune with this extract
its big in the miami club scene
we call it passion
giggles isnt that cute
up ahead laroche turns off the road at the fakahatchee sign
orlean contd follow him please
kaufman parks behind him
orlean gestures with her gun for him to get out
as kaufman comes around the car he sees donald on the floor of the back seat
laroche emerges from his van with a flashlight and a rifle slung over his shoulder
orlean prods kaufman to follow him
kaufman shakes and whimpers as they all step down into the thigh high water
they slog through silently
this spot looks good
thinking aloud now how do we do this
hit him in the head with a rock first
keeping in mind we can only hit him once and only with as much force as would be created by him slipping and falling onto the rock
orlean finds a place to sit on a hammock
she unwraps a small square of paper and snorts something out of it
orleans drugs kick in
hey baby hey
orlean trails off
laroche talks to the spaced out orlean
should we drown him then hit him on the head
a body bleeds different if the hearts stopped
these new forensic guys are very smart
we really have to know our corpses to stand a chance rigor mortis lividity putrefecation ocular changes
laroche contd maybe you think we hit him on the head and force water into his lungs after hes dead
theyll know he didnt drown
see contrary to popular belief the lungs do not do not fill with water in a drowning
what happens is choking causes an irritation of the mucous membranes
this creates a shitload of mucus in the windpipe
efforts to breathe turn the mucus into a sticky foam which may or may not mix with vomit
its the presence of this white foam that indicates drowning
theres a lot to be aware of susie
shoeprints hair microscopic fibers
they all tell a tale to todays forensic scientists
to kaufman what do you think
youre a writer
how would you do it
whats a good way to kill somebody
i dont write this kind of bullshit
dont get all huffy i was simply suddenly laroche gets whacked in the back flies forward into the water
orlean looks up spaced
shes confused by a second kaufman standing there with a bag of potting soil
donald grabs kaufman and they run back toward the road
laroche pulls himself from the water
laroche contd fuck
receptively yeah lets baby
she staggers moonily toward laroche
he pushes her away
we got to kill that guy
and now i guess that other guy as well
kaufman and donald speed along the swamp road
for christs sake why didnt you do something while we were in the car
my back had seized
i couldnt move
laroches van pulls close to them and rams them from behind
it rams them again this time sending them down into the swamp
the van stops
donald tries to back the car onto the road the wheels just spin
laroche steps out of the van
weve gotta ditch this thing
hysterical its a rental
its a rental
kaufman and donald climb from the car make their way deep into the swamp
laroche follows them in on foot dragging orlean who is admiring all the plant life
whats that johnny
whats that one called
i just so want to fuck that flower dont you
but we dont have time
laroche shoots at the brothers
to orlean whats his name
charlie or something
listen lets talk
this pie is big enough for four people
to orlean why are there two of him
laughs crazily did i say twigs
i meant twins
kaufman and donald run through a colony of sawgrass
it slices them like razor blades
kaufman yells in pain
blood oozes through their shirts and pants
cladium jamaicense guys
you want to watch out for that
thats some evil shit
cut you up
fuck you laroche
just tryin to be helpful
walk with us and ill be sure you avoid all the pitfalls
i know these swamps forwards and backwards
theres alligators and poisonous snakes fellas
kaufman and donald are stopped by a large body of water
nowhere to go
laroche and orlean close in
the brothers run along the periphery of the lake
do you hear something
kaufman stops hears a distant galloping and squealing
donald that sounds bad
the brothers run in the opposite direction
the galloping gets louder
its wild pigs
donald spots an airboat on the shore
they jump onto it search hysterically in the dark for bow to start it
the pigs get closer
laroche and orlean get closer
donald finds a button presses it the engine starts
they pull away from the shore just as the pigs catch up
one pig leaps on board squealing
kaufman kicks at it as donald attempts to steer the boat
a kick connects and the pig flies into the water
laroche stands at the shoreline and fires his rifle
it nicks the boat
donald looks back and the boat heads for a cypress stand
watch out watch out watch out
donald gets the boat back on course
laroche and orlean have been left far behind
donald slows the boat
i think were okay
suddenly laroches van comes tearing around a corner and speeds along the road at the waters edge
orlean shoots at the boat from the van window
donald contd hold on
donald speeds up
the van keeps up the shooting continues
kaufman puts his head in his hands
a bullet hits the airboats gas tank
it explodes in a ball of flame illuminating the whole swamp
kaufman and donald are thrown along with flaming pieces of debris
donald treads water looks all around for kaufman
donald contd charles
where are you
a dazed kaufman tries to get his bearings
the murky lake bottom is lit a dim orange by the fire on the surface
an alligator appears
kaufman panics surfaces
on the surface donald spots kaufman pop out of the water then get jerked back down
the alligator violently shakes kaufman by the leg
donald surfaces comes back down with a broken propeller blade
he hacks the alligators head off grabs kaufman and brings him to the surface
donald swims to shore with kaufman in tow
another shot is fired
it skims the water near kaufman
fuck donald were dead
hows your leg
i dont know
hows your back
my back is fine
laroche and orlean circle the lake in the van shooting
mike owen in pajamas leaves his house jumps in his truck and agitatedly drives toward the noise and flames
donald makes it to shore
he climbs out and is helping kaufman when he gets hit by a bullet and falls
kaufman sloshes to shore
his right leg is bloody and mangled
he lifts his brothers head onto his lap
youre gonna be okay
but dont let them get you too
weak smile you got a fucking awesome third act
crying donald this is an awful bizarre thing to say and an awful time to say it but im sorry i didnt get to know you better
im so sorry
im so sorry
youve been really nice
see its just i thought i knew you already
i thought you were me
and i hated me
donald touches kaufmans face
kaufman looks at his brother
donalds face glows radiantly in the fire light
well dont do that anymore
kaufman screams heavenward
the van appears out of the bush barreling for them
kaufman rolls his brother out of the way and limps off into a slough
the van follows smashes into a tree and comes to a halt
smoke pours from the grill and is lit by the headlights
out of the smoke laroche and orlean appear with guns
they follow kaufman into the swamp
mike owen pulls next to the disabled van
he gets out surveys the mess sees bloody donald on the ground
jesus that writer guy
owen grabs his c
tries to radio for help
he lifts donald into the back of the truck and speeds off
kaufman limps through the dark water
laroche and orlean follow the sound of his sloshing
water sounds so sparkly
like lemon plastic jewels plopping onto a silver trampoline
can we fuck now baby
fuck like lemons
owen tears along the dirt road
up ahead kaufman limps out of the swamp into the trucks headlights
owen is confused
he checks the back to see if donalds body is still there and skids off the road into the swamp
kaufman hurriedly limps over to the disabled truck
owen climbs out
you gotta help me
you gotta help me
what the hell is going on here
theyre after me
theyve got guns
they killed my brother
whos got guns
what are you before owen finishes his truck is flipped over
donalds body flies into the water
there staring kaufman and owen down is a giant man like beast
its repulsive covered in algae matted fur
mike owen contd holy shit
the two men turn and run
mike owen contd its real
i cant believe it i never the creature grabs owen and snaps his neck like a toothpick
kaufman screams as he runs watches over his shoulder
he runs right into the arms of orlean
hey its the screenwriter
theres a thing back there
you dont want to be here
kaufman orlean and laroche look back
youre right i dont want to be here
im tired lets get this over with
laroche puts the gun to kaufmans head
orlean studies laroches gun
her nose is practically touching the barrel
i love your gun baby
can we trade
stand back sweetness
laroche reaches for orleans arm to pull her away
suddenly the creature grabs laroche pulls him into the swamp
laroche contd susie
orlean looks around
whered johnny go
orlean agitated and disoriented fires repeatedly into the darkness
something slumps forward in the water
orlean steps cautiously over keeping her gun on kaufman
the creature is dead so is laroche
crying softly oh johnny
she sits next to laroche and pets his head
kaufman watches her
the sun is coming up
id just stare at your picture and you looked so sweet
i read your words and i thought you were smart and maybe lost and lonely like me
and the way you wrote about laroche
you said he was handsome even though he had no front teeth oh johnny
i figured you could look at me and see something even with all my flaws you could look at me and find something you could maybe someday write a description
of me that would be nicer than the one i write day in and day out in my head
hopefully would it be
kaufman takes orleans chin in his hand and directs her gaze to him
she stares at him for a long while then youre really so wonderful
i can see inside your soul
it glows with orange sadness
its raining inside you
i want to run through your dripply dripples
its so beautiful
i love you
kaufman lets go of her face and sits on a rock
its the drugs
orlean stands and walks toward kaufman
no its me
its the real me
look at you
i just want to hold you and oh crap its wearing off
she paces unfolds her little square of paper
orlean contd im out
im fucking cleaned out
kaufman watches her for a moment
i cant let you go fatty
i cant let you make this public
kaufman keeps walking
orlean contd you hear me
you pathetic fat bald
you dont even know how to write
youre not even
youre not leaving here
screaming crying i need a fix
everythings so ugly
orlean screams in anguish
kaufman keeps walking
orlean shakily aims the gun at his back
kaufman falls gets up keeps walking
she aims again through her tears
suddenly shes pounced on by a bloody soaking wet figure
kaufman limps back
donald and orlean roll on the ground
my brother is not fat
hes not bald
my brother is a great writer
he was trying to do something important
the gun fires
orlean slumps over donald
both donald and orlean are dead
kaufman falls to his knees
the sun is high
a tow truck extricates one of the crashed vehicles
state police cars ambulances ranger trucks abound
kaufman is wrapped in a blanket
he is with a cop and pointing to the bodies spread on a black plastic tarp
thats mike owen
i dont know what that is
i think it might be a swamp ape
and thats donald my twin brother
he saved my life
kaufman cries a little
the cop waits sympathetically then you two really look alike
yes we do
kaufman sits in a booth working longhand on a legal pad
hes a little scraped up a little tougher
a copy of story by mckee is among his reference material
alice the waitress walks by and glances at the table
oh i love mckee
recognizes kaufman gets reserved oh hi

it was a wake up call
im so sorry

theres a pause
alice just stares at him in awe
listen do you mind if i sit for a sec
but youre working
shrugs its a stupid job yknow
i like that name
ive always really liked that name
alice smiles sits
the two of them begin to talk
an enormous chunk of rock dimly lit by faraway stars floats by
let me have men about me that are fat sleek headed men and such that sleep o nights
