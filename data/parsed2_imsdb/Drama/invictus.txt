aka the human factor written by anthony peckham based on material by john carlin second draft sport has the power to change the world
it has the power to inspire the power to unite people that little else has
it is more powerful than governments in breaking down racial barriers
a big rich powerhouse all white high school located near the freeway into cape town
the rugby fields are immaculate
fifteen year old boys in striped rugby jerseys train with total intensity under the critical eye of the coach
right across the boundary fence from the rugby fields is an area of waste land leading up to the freeway
there black and colored mixed race boys of the same age play a loose game of soccer with a tennis ball
most of them have bare feet and threadbare dirty clothes most of them are noticeably smaller and skinnier than the white boys
two cultures separated by more than the high boundary fence
a commotion on the freeway intrudes on the soccer game
horns honking cars pull over onto the shoulder people jump out
lead by police motorbikes then patrol cars a white mercedes approaches heading towards cape town
whoever is in the mercedes has stopped traffic
the soccer players abandon their game and run for the freeway whistling and shouting
the rugby players are more disciplined or obedient and do not acknowledge the commotion until the convoy passes right by them
the coach shakes his head in disgust
who is it sir
its that terrorist mandela
they let him out
remember this day boys
its the day our country went to the dogs

as applause fades
we can make out the form of a tall man sleeping alone at the very edge of the big bed as if not wanting to rumple the blankets too much
on the bedside table the clock clicks from to
the mans eyes open in the dark instantly awake
he reaches out switches on the light
nelson rolihlahla mandela sits up and gets out of bed in one movement
he has the physical vigor and energy of someone twenty years younger
the second he is up he turns around and makes his bed leaving it as flawlessly smooth as a hospital bed
or a prison bunk
for this is the discipline of twenty seven years behind bars
dressed in a tracksuit and cross trainers mandela comes down the stairs and heads for the front door
this is a nice big house but it is amazingly modest for the president of a wealthy nation and arguably the most famous man on the planet
mandela steps outside closes his front door quietly takes a moment to savor the air
it is bone dry and cold typical conditions in the highveld at this time of year
it is so quiet that for a moment it seems as if mandela is completely alone in the world
the big yard is fenced
there is a small guard house at the driveway gate
when mandela steps away from the house a uniformed south african policeman in the guardhouse pushes the button that opens the gate
when the gate begins to open we see that there are two grey bmws parked either side of it
linga moonsamy comes to full alert as the gate opens
he is a big scowling man dressed in a suit
he checks the load on a pistol tucks it into his shoulder holster
here he comes
it makes him such an easy target
behind linga in the back seat sits jason tshabalala a naturally tense and suspicious man
both of them are hollow eyed exhausted running on adrenaline
they get out of the bmw fast and quiet
this does not look good
as mandela walks out through the gate jason and linga intercept him
traditional greeting in i see you father
mandelas face comes alive as he smiles
without breaking stride morning boys
how are you
jason is mandelas head of personal security linga his number one bodyguard
they are both former terrorists and they are utterly devoted to mandela
were sharp madiba
and hows your mother doing linga
shes much better thank you
mandela picks up the pace
jason and linga fall back so that they are a few steps behind him
they share a quick look
they hate this walk
it scares them
theres no way for it to be anything but completely unsanitary from a security point of view
a small delivery van drives really fast blows through stop signs
mandela strides along the big wide tree lined streets
jason and linga shadow him eyes and ears alert
up ahead we see a small upscale area of shops and mandela jason and linga reach the shopping area
another angle of the shops as the small van turns onto the street with a squeal of tires
the sliding door on the van is opened from inside
too dark to see in
mandela jason and linga pass a huge poster of mandela in the window of corner grocery
mandela does not react to this giant picture of himself jason and linga do proudly a general note starting with the window of this grocery there are pictures of mandela
magazine covers newspaper centerfolds t shirts childrens art as if to make up for all the time mandelas image and words were banned
until they hear the sound of the van tearing towards them
they turn see headlights veering to their side of the
both men drop their hands to their guns
linga steps in front of mandela shielding him jason steps out wide ready for anything
mandela is completely calm
the van screeches to a halt just past them
a guy jumps out of the van holding a tied bundle of newspapers which he drops with a thump at the grocery door
the guy doesnt see them
the delivery van is gone before the newspapers stop moving
mandela heads for the newspapers he wants to see the headlines
jason and linga take their hands off their guns but they do not relax
these are dangerous times
go in on the top newspaper which shows a photo of the inauguration and the following words in afrikaans he can what does it say
it says he can win an election but can he run a country
not even one day on the job and theyre after you
its a legitimate question
mandela turns and marches for home
jason and linga fall in behind him
in the east the first milky hint of day
the house is now bustling with activity
a pretty member of the kitchen staff sets a single place at the head of a big formal dining table
a lady chef stirs the porridge a kitchen assistant cuts fresh fruit
mandelas personal secretary mary marches out of her small office with a stack of correspondence and five newspapers places them neatly next to the table setting
outside mandela is surrounded by men
inside he has surrounded himself with women of all shapes colors and ages to make up for twenty seven years without
mandela shaves upstairs in the bathroom
the razor is dull
mandela opens drawers looking for another
he opens a drawer that is empty but for a womans beaded bracelet broken and shedding tiny colored beads
mandela looks for it for a moment then closes the drawer looks at himself in the mirror
mostly mandelas face is warm animated energetic and this is how we see him almost all the time
but sometimes his face can be a remote sphinx like mask that conceals all emotion all feeling
this is his prison face
this is the face that looks back at mandela right now in the mirror
it is the face of a man whose long hard journey has marked his very soul
expressionless mandela shaves himself with the dull razor
over a cock crows and a quick series of shots as the rainbow nation wakes up
today marks the beginning of a new era in south africa from the bush to the cities from shanty towns to ocean front mansions people start their day
as president mandela takes office in pretoria facing issues that range from economic stagnation and unemployment to rising crime some start the day with a tea tray placed next to
their beds by discreet black hands some with nothing more than brown river water and half a fire blackened ear of corn for breakfast
while at the same time balancing black aspirations with white fears
the tv is turned off by mr
pienaar late s in his very modest blue collar house
i never thought id see the day
pienaar turns and addresses his son francois pienaar a big blond almost handsome man with a fighters face and mangled ears
brutal toughness and honor in his features
a powerful physical presence possibly dangerous
francois drips with sweat wears running clothes
whatever he does he is strong fit and driven
i feel sorry for you son
youve got your whole life ahead of you
whats it going to be like now
pienaar late s enters holding some kind of protein shake for pienaar
dont be so gloomy
handing over shake i added vitamins theres a horrible flu bug going around
tell nerine when you get home
im telling you francois look at angola look at mozambique
look at zimbabwe
theyre going to take our jobs and drive us into the sea
just you wait
magnificent sweeping government buildings made of carved african field stone with an italian tiled roof situated on a hill overlooking pretoria
the seat of power
today the entrance is mobbed with a huge joyous multi racial throng plus news crews from all over the world
lots of new south african flags evident
we move through the throng and swoop up into the air so that we can soar along the outside of the building and look through the windows into the offices
of state where people who worked for the de klerk regime are packing up in anticipation of being booted out by the mandela regime
these characters run the gamut from little old afrikaner tea ladies in tears to the stoic fossils of grand apartheid
they are all white
a good third of the offices are already deserted
the deserted offices have open doors
through a window through an open door we see mandela and his bodyguards striding down a union building hallway
we swoop in through the window and catch up with the new president
mandela is regal in a magnificent tailored suit
jason in front linga behind
portraits of the architects and champions of apartheid look down sternly on them as they pass
they pass a worker hanging a portrait of mandela next to one of de klerk the previous president
on linga as he smiles at that
mandela on the other hand looks into the empty offices and into the offices being packed up
up ahead the double doors to the office of the president are closed
jason speeds up opens them pokes his head in then opens the doors wide
with great pride after you mr
mandelas offices are fronted by a large reception area already filled with people waiting to see him
to one side are his chief of staffs suite of offices to the other side the small presidential security office
beyond these are mandelas secretaries typists and assistants his gatekeepers
beyond that is the inner sanctum mandelas own office
the phones are ringing off the hook
fax machines are chattering
everyone wants a piece of mandela
mandela enters jason and linga behind him
good morning everybody
barbara masekela mandelas chief of staff and now ambassador to the u
emerges from her office carrying an arm load of files folders and papers barbara good morning
youve had your hair done
i like it
accompanies mandela back towards his office
thank you madiba
we need to talk about your cabinet appointments and ministers
give me one moment please
barbara waits outside mandelas office as he enters ahead of her
mandela stands in the middle of his office takes a moment to savor where he is
then he takes off his jacket hangs it up and is ready for work
please assemble the staff for me
whoever has not already left
all of them
whats left of the union building staff are packed into the dining room
white faces bitter and resentful
waiting to be fired
through the glass doors they see mandela approaching down the hallway linga and jason with him
here he comes
he wants the satisfaction of firing us himself
they stand up straight determined to receive the ax with pride
linga and jason amp up when they see the room full of restless afrikaners
at the staff dining room door mandela turns to them
id like you to stay out here please
i cannot talk to them if im hiding behind men with guns
mandela opens the doors and enters
jason and linga stay outside
mandela enters smiles gets not one smile in return
gooie more almal
does he think greeting us in afrikaans makes this any sweeter
some of you may know who i am
this gets a few bitter chuckles
mandela is at this best just talking to people like this
only he doesnt just talk to them he wades in amongst them shaking hands and making individual contact as he speaks to all of them
how are you
thank you for coming at such short notice
mandela is a continual security nightmare
you can see the tension on jason and lingas faces as he disappears into the throng
when mandela reaches the middle of the room he stops shaking hands and turns slowly as he talks to everybody
i couldnt help noticing the empty offices as i came to work today
and all the packing boxes
one black man surrounded by a throng of serious white faces
now of course if you want to leave that is your right
and if you feel in your heart that you cannot work with your new government then it is better that you do leave right away
he can be tough and blunt when necessary
but if you are packing up because you fear that your language or the color of your skin or who you served previously disqualifies you from working here now i
am here to tell you have no such fear
wat is verby is verby
whats past is past
we look to the future now
this is not what they expected to hear
we need your help
we want your help
if you would like to stay you will be doing your country a great service
mandela pauses to look at the faces
they are receptive
i ask only that you do your jobs to the best of your abilities and with good hearts
i promise to do the same
if we can manage that our country will be a shining light in the world
jason and linga are right outside the glass doors looking in and listening
jason shakes his head
he wants to win them over one damn boer at a time
mandela heads back through to his office barbara mary and other assistants forming a phalanx around him
linga peels off goes into the security office
jason stands at the desk of one of the assistants jessie waits for her to finish a call then molo sister
its still morning
when you get a chance can we see the schedule for the month
we need to plan security
jessies phone rings
office of the president good morning
jessie waves jason off
he crosses to the security office enters
once he closes the door behind him jason shows his fatigue
linga is feet up on the sofa sucking on a cup of coffee
three more bodyguards sam kwezi and winston slump in chairs
jason grabs coffee sits at his desk puts his feet up with a groan
we need more men
did you talk to barbara about it
a knock at the door
thats jessie with the schedule
come in beautiful
the door opens but what enters is not beautiful
four big white cops in suits enter special branch written all over them
etienne van eck hendrick booyens george and the bodyguards stand up like junk yard dogs protecting their territory
what is this
am i under arrest
etienne snaps out a crisp salute
captain van eck and team reporting for duty sir
hendrick george and willem snap out salutes
their military deportment contrasts strongly with the less rigid body language of the black bodyguards
were the presidential bodyguard
weve been assigned to this office
holding out a sheet of here are our orders
jason takes the orders studies them face increasingly angry
youre special branch right
hendrick nods sternly
linga sam kwezi and winston react to that there is a long and brutal history between them and the special branch
youll see that theyve been signed
i dont care if theyre signed or jason does a double take when he sees the signature on the orders nelson r
jason storms out holding the orders
the four black bodyguards seethe with hostility
the four white bodyguards stare straight ahead refusing to give ground
mandela and barbara look over a position paper on something or other
when jason knocks and enters they pause
sorry to disturb you
you look agitated jason
thats because ive got four special branch cops in my office
what have you done
they say theyre the presidential bodyguard
they have orders
signed by you
theyve had special training those boys with the sas
and lots of experience
they protected de klerk
yes but you asked for more men didnt you
yes but in public when people see me they see my bodyguards too
you represent me directly
the rainbow nation starts here
reconciliation starts here
madiba not long ago they tried to kill us
maybe even these four guys
they tried and often they succeeded
linga sam winston and kwezi stare down etienne hendrick george and willem
mandela stares at jason in an entirely different way with wisdom compassion and sympathy
yes i know
forgiveness starts here too
mandela lets that sink in for a moment
he knows he asks for something very difficult but he demands it of himself to an even greater degree
forgiveness liberates the soul
it removes fear
that is why it is such a powerful weapon jason
please try it
he isnt remotely ready to forgive
sorry to disturb you
jason turns leaves
barbara shakes her head at mandela
you ask a lot
only what is necessary
as jason very upset walks back to security jessie holds out a file for him
two copies of the schedule
jason snatches the file keeps walking
thank you jessie
when he reaches the security office door jason walks right past keeps going has to make a full loop of the reception area just to get himself together
even so when he gets back to the security office door jason pauses gathers himself to do something that he knows hes going to hate
things havent eased up one little bit inside the office
the silence is deafening
jason enters looks them all over
his face is grim
can we get rid of these guys now
jason flashes a look at linga then and this hurts him visibly he holds out one of mandelas schedules to etienne
this is his schedule for the next month
lets look it over for duty assignments
linga and the others are shocked
jason i have to talk to you
linga virtually pulls jason out of the office
just outside the security office door so they keep their voices low
how can we trust them
heading back in this is what madiba wants okay
not okay for linga judging by the expression on his face
when jason and linga enter etienne looks up from mandelas schedule
are there any special orders or conditions
madiba gets upset if you dont smile when you push people out of the way
its the new south africa
the presidents clan name
its what we call him
the new bodyguards share a look
theyre not comfortable with madiba
well call him mr
jason lifts the schedule
lets get through this
still upset and hostile the black bodyguards look over jasons shoulder the white bodyguards look over etiennes at the months schedule
apartheid is by no means dead in this cramped little office
both teams study and discuss the schedule shop talk tbd etienne shakes his head
hows he going to do all this
when does he take a break
he says he rested enough in prison
jason recoils at something he sees on the last page of the schedule
heres a headache
a rugby match at loftus versfeld
british lions against the springboks
its going to be a headache for the lions thats for sure
were going to donder them
i dont care about the game
i care that the presidentll be so exposed
to thousands of drunken sports fans
who didnt vote for him
who probably hate him
who came out of the womb with guns in their hands
a huge raucous crowd almost entirely white and male
many wearing the springbok green and gold
widespread evidence of drinking
lots of old south african flags the blue white and orange apartheid flag make a defiant statement against the new south african flags ringing the stadium
on the field the rugby teams assemble and face each other in two lines
the british lions in their white on white with black and red trim the springboks in their green and gold
like their supporters the springboks are all white but for one man who is colored mixed race
big tough brutal looking men
we may or may not notice francois pienaar standing at the head of the line of springboks
at the entrance of the tunnel onto the field lots of cops in blue south african police uniforms
behind the line of cops in the tunnel we find jason and all the other bodyguards but for linga
they are keyed up intense none more so than jason
shouting against the i want your eyes on the crowd at all times
were staying in the middle of the field
hes going to walk out shake hands walk back
they are like the players at game time only the stakes are much higher
jason looks deeper into the tunnel straightens up
here we go
mandela strides down the tunnel towards them wearing a dark suit
big crowds energize him
his eyes are alive with excitement
one pace behind him like a huge dark shadow comes linga
mandela gives jason a look jason nods
we follow mandela and the bodyguards out of the tunnel onto the field towards the waiting teams
the crowd rise to their feet
lots of them jeer mandela lots cheer
all the old south african flags are waved at him defiantly plus some new ones
mandela waves to them all smiling proudly
to him a crowd is an opportunity to make new friends
but he stays in the center of the field
jason and crew are hyper alert a human fence around mandela
mandela reaches the rugby players
waiting for him at the head of the springbok line wearing the number jersey and captains armband is francois pienaar
now we know what he does
mandela extends his hand
good luck captain
thank you sir
mandela shakes hands down the line of springboks then returns shaking hands with the british lions
quick perfunctory handshakes
as mandela does this we take bodyguard pov snapshots of the crowd increasingly keyed up and restless
time to play rugby
mandela finishes waves to the crowd and begins the walk along the center of the field back to the tunnel
crowd noise increases
they know the opening whistle is about to blow
then mandela sees something in the crowd at field level
without warning mandela changes direction heads towards this group towards a wall of his former and perhaps current enemies
on jason shit
stay with him
stay with him
with his bodyguards scrambling to stay in position mandela reaches the stands hand outstretched leans into the crowd
thank you for honoring our new flag
some shake his hand some very pointedly do not
the crowd noise takes on an ugly undertone mandela is delaying the rugby
mandela is undeterred
hes into this one on one outreach
he turns looks for more hands to shake and jason steps in between mandela and the crowd
were delaying the rugby madiba
oh yes of course
mandela gives one last wave turns away
as he does someone winds up and throws something from the stands
jason and etienne catch the movement whirl too late
an orange whizzes past mandelas head explodes juicily on the field
mandela didnt see it doesnt react
if anything his smile widens as he heads across the field
the bodyguards close around him protectively get him back to the tunnel
jason signals for extra bodyguards to escort mandela all the way up to his box
hendrick the biggest leads the way
jason stays in the tunnel along with etienne
both men are in a muck sweat adrenaline coursing through them
why didnt you stop him
next time you try
does he do that sort of thing all the time
ask my ulcer
good thing that was just an orange
and good thing he never saw it
oh he saw it
he sees everything
rubbing his ulcer i hate rugby
two international front rows come together with bone crunching force
huge violent men grunt like bulls
the crowd roar vibrates the stadium
the scrum a phalanx of eight men locked together against eight wheels buckles then steadies under the watchful eye of the referee
fanning out behind each scrum are the backs faster more glamorous players who will run with the ball or kick it
the lions scrumhalf thrusts the ball into the maw of the scrum the huge men lock up against each other with maximum force
the ball comes out the back of the lions scrum the scrumhalf dive passes it away to the backs who flick it out laterally to the wing with lightning speed
the wing lofts a delicate kick just over the onrushing springbok defenders
the lions charge the ball which bounces erratically right into the hands of the man who kicked it
one last burst of speed one quick juke to avoid a desperation tackle and the wing scores in the corner
as the lions kicker gets ready to convert the try we find the springboks huddling under their goal posts hands on their hips stunned
at the center of the huddle pienaar bleeds behind his gum guard as furiously he tries to inject some fire into his team
we can beat these guys if we play our game not theirs
on pienaar as he realizes he is not getting through
there is dullness shock in his players eyes which all lift to the heavens as the conversion kick soars through the uprights
we follow the kick as it drops past a giant scoreboard
stay on the scoreboard as it registers the conversion and shows the score lions springboks in the vip box mandela turns his back on the field as the game restarts
beneath him and continues in the background
he has binoculars around his neck
shall we work while we watch
we have lots of promises to keep
barbara sits to his right with her ever present files and folders
yes we do
mary pours tea at the back of the box
linga stands two steps behind mandela
on mandelas left sits the president of south african rugby a small man with a small mans ruthlessness and drive
its not too late if the boys can just pick up their game
if they dont heads will roll
this is unacceptable
come on you bloody bastards
mandelas expression shows that he has a gentlemans distaste for profanity
he turns to barbara
where do you want go first for foreign investment
where the money is
america england saudi arabia
barbara makes notes
mandela lifts his binoculars but instead of looking at the rugby he looks at the crowd
mandelas pov through binoculars mandela zeroes in on an old south african flag the apartheid flag
it is being held by the four khaki clad boers farmers
classic south african figures from the rural far north they are already drunk and suicidally depressed by the turn of events on the field
do you see all the old apartheid flags
its a disgrace
mandela lowers his binoculars
its also a constitutional right
along with the apartheid anthem
but its time people moved on
mandela grunts raises his binoculars again
mandelas pov through binoculars mandela finds a small knot of black spectators holding the new south african flag and cheering ecstatically
look at that
the whites are cheering for the springboks the blacks are cheering for the lions
mandela lowers the binoculars
we did that on the island you know
we supported anyone but the boks
it really irritated the warders
of course it did
on mandela as he thinks about this for a moment then lifts his binoculars to look at the crowd again
mandelas pov through binoculars on the knot of black spectators who leap to their feet reacting to action on the where the lions score yet another try
this is an ass whipping
the conversion sails over the boks heads
the scoreboard clicks over to lions springboks o mandela lowers his binoculars sets them aside shakes his head
he knows its hopeless now
he turns to the rugby president
how long until the world cup
about a year
plenty of time for improvement
the rugby president cant take it
president i wouldnt get my hopes up
were a damn disgrace
he stomps out of the box no doubt looking for someone to fire
mandela gets back to work
i want to go to india and indonesia too
there is a knock at the luxury box door
linga swings to face the door alert as a uniformed doorman opens it
the minister of sport steve tshwete enters
sorry im late
he sits down in the empty chair to the right of mandela
hows it going
the minister of sport checks the score winces
maybe its just as well
mandela shoots him a sharp look
bending close talking ive just been at a meeting of the national sports council executive
theres strong support to drop the springbok emblem and colors altogether
gesturing at the field if theyre playing badly maybe its a good time to make a change
with barely hidden
minister of sport contd this could be the last time we have to look at the green and gold
the minister of sport shoots a glance at mandela to see his reaction to all this
mandela is deep in thought and completely unreadable
one last bloody violent bit of play then mercifully the final whistle blows
final score lions springboks
the lions celebrate
the springboks head off the field heads down shoulders bowed in defeat none more bitterly disappointed or bloodier than francois pienaar
in the stands the unheard of happens the springboks are booed by their own fans
not by everybody but by enough
we stay with the boks as they trudge across the field then clatter along the concrete tunnel to their dressing room
the atmosphere is absolutely dismal as the men undress and shower
nobody catches anybody elses eye
huge powerful pale bodies have been ploughed purple with rake marks bruises and roasties
plus one dark body that of chester williams a skilled wing from the cape a reserved and private man
pienaar takes off his green and gold jersey sits begins taking off his cleats
his body hurts
he has been raked scratched bruised and his ankle is swollen
a noble warrior defeated
francois pienaars team came to loftus versfeld stadium this afternoon unprepared and arrogant
meet boland botha as he tapes his commentary on the test match
he is an ex springbok player from the boycott years now turned ponderous florid rugby commentator
he is a household name and the last word on the state of the springboks
they left minutes later with their tails between their legs like whipped mongrels
and i for one am glad
not because we lost but because theres now no way to disguise the fact that we are completely and utterly unprepared to reenter the world of top notch international rugby
boland defines the south african talent for pessimism and negativity
the rugby world cup is now less than a year away and i for one am relieved that we are the host nation and therefore qualify automatically for the tournament
because im not sure we would get in on merit alone
the rugby president sucks on a rum and coke watches boland with one of his henchmen
who gets the axe
someone has to
no after match party this night
still depressed by the loss pienaar stays home with this fiancee nerine
pienaars team played without discipline without strategy and without courage
hes trying to get them to drop me
hes just bitter because the springboks were boycotted when he played
maybe but people listen to what he says
wearing pyjamas dressing gown and slippers mandela multi tasks watching boland botha and going through a pile of correspondence scribbling notes or signing his name
they brought shame upon our nation and i for one can say without fear of contradiction that today these fifteen so called men did not deserve to wear the hallowed
green and gold
on mandela a thought an idea a big one is churning in his head
he grunts turns off the tv puts the correspondence aside stands
mary enters with a glass of milk and some pills on a tray
heres your muti
i warmed the milk tonight
youre too good to me
mandela takes his pills
your daughter called to cancel her visit this weekend
mandela pauses between pills
did she say why
no she didnt
making it up she said to tell you she was sorry
mandela nods has a hard time swallowing his last pill
do you need anything else tonight
no thank you
im going to bed
good night madiba
mandela smiles at her but as soon as he is past her the smile fades
as he climbs the stairs to his bedroom his face becomes sadder and older and lonelier
in his bedroom mandela pauses to take off his dressing gown
he looks at his bed
it is as smooth and as blank as a sheet of paper
he peels back the bedclothes at one corner slides under them and pauses for a moment while reaching for the light switch
he switches off the light and lies down still and straight
the most popular man in the world starts and ends each day alone
a very poor township outside johannesburg
a stark reminder of how much work mandela has ahead of him
a stampede of kids runs by
we follow the kids and find a small beat up church
a noisy line of threadbare kids leads from outside into the church
there is a pecking order in the line based on size
no pushing now
theres enough for everybody
at a table near the altar the kids rummage through bags of second hand clothes under the watchful eye of mrs
coleman a stout and charitable woman
next to her mrs
dlamini hands out a lollipop and says god bless you
to each kid
the clothes and lollipops move fast rhythm kept by mrs
dlaminis god bless yous
the last bag of clothes empties fast as the line of kids reduces until there is only one small boy sipho left and only one article of clothing
an old springbok rugby practise jersey
green and gold
sipho could use it
his clothes are more holes than anything else
he looks at the springbok jersey mournfully
youre a very lucky boy
its a real springbok practise jersey
its a bit big but its warm and itll last for ever
sipho shakes his head
its yours take it
sipho turns and leaves
coleman looks at mrs
dlamini completely confused
why wont he take it
if he wears it the others will beat him up
because the springboks are playing so badly
because for them the springboks still represent apartheid
eersterust is a settlement and conference location just outside pretoria
today it is the location of a full membership meeting of the national sports council an anc organization that is now the governing body of all sports in south africa
a banner draped across the conference center entrance tells us so welcome national sports council
an nsc firebrand has the podium and the microphone
and now for the next item on our agenda
the hall is jammed
very few white faces
the nsc executive proposes a full membership vote on the following motion
a ripple of anticipation goes through the delegates
that as a prominent symbol of the apartheid era the colors emblem and name of the springboks be eliminated immediately
that causes a stir
the delegates understand how big this is
and that all sports teams representing south africa shall be known forthwith as the proteas
excitement and noise level rises
the nsc firebrand has to shout through his mike
we will submit this motion to a hand vote
nsc firebrand contd in the event of a close count we will go to a written ballot
the moment hes been the nsc firebrand shoots his clenched fist into the air
with a roar the delegates respond raising their fists
the springboks are history
another angle as one of the older delegates steps outside to make a call
at his desk mandela puts down his phone
anger in his eyes
he slams both palms down hard on his desk
both bodyguard units minus jason are crammed into the small office
the black bodyguards murmur amongst themselves in xhosa
the white bodyguards talk afrikaans ad lib
no talk between the two units only tension
tension broken with a crash as jason slams the door open
both units to the cars right now
grey bmw armored grey mercedes grey bmw in a line at the entrance
jason kwezi winston and sam scramble out of the building and dive into the lead bmw
etienne hendrick george and willem dive into the trailer
brusque scowling mandela marches towards the exit shadowed by linga flanked by barbara
what do i tell the japanese trade delegation
i delegate that decision to you
do you want me to inform the vp
we should at least include the minister of sport
mandela heads out to the cars
barbara has no choice but to follow
ever the gentleman mandela ushers barbara into the mercedes
as she gets in i strongly advise against doing this
especially on your own
it it gives the impression of autocratic leadership
mandela gets in closes the door
you risk alienating your cabinet and your party
your advice is duly noted barbara
the people want this
they hate the springboks
they dont want to be represented by a team they cheered against all their lives
yes i know
but in this instance the people are wrong
and it is my job as their elected leader to make them see that
mandela leans forward to talk to linga
can you tell the boys that madiba wants to go to eersterust very fast
linga murmurs into his radio
the convoy pulls out very fast
barbara makes one last plea
youre risking your political capital
youre risking your future as our leader
the day i am afraid to do that is the day i am no longer fit to lead
at least risk it for something more important than rugby
mandela looks out the window says nothing angry
mandelas convoy heads away from pretoria very fast
and in concluding this historic conference
brothers sisters comrades we in the executive applaud your diligence and courage
the nsc firebrand and the executive applaud the members
the applause spreads until the hall rocks
they are all very pleased with themselves
mandelas convoy roars in
mandela is the first one out linga next
jason and crew scramble to cover the immediate area
kwezi opens the door for barbara on the other side
mandela strides over to jason says something to him
jason looks surprised turns to hendrick
lingas customary scowl intensifies
as the applause finally begins to diminish the nsc firebrand turns and nods to a church choir director off to the side
the choir director brings his choir onto the stage
join us in our anthem
anyone not standing stands
the choir director raises his hands
the choir inhales
nkosi sikelel iafrica etc god bless africa but before the first line is fully sung an assistant rushes out whispers urgently into the nsc firebrands ear
the firebrands eyes bug out in surprise
he crosses to the choir director says something quickly
the choir director stops the choir in mid chorus
whats going on
brothers sisters members of the choir we would only interrupt such beautiful music for something truly important
in this case for someone truly important
beat milking it please welcome president mandela
the place goes berserk as mandela enters with linga at his back and surprise surprise hendrick booyens leading the way
face stern and unsmiling mandela walks the length of the hall towards the podium
the delegates press in towards them
another angle jason coordinates security inside and out
lifts his radio to his mouth
on hendrick as his standard bad bastard scowl suddenly becomes a smile which scares the throng more than the scowl did
on linga the same
another angle barbara enters at the back of the hall accompanied by kwezi
mandela reaches the podium turns looks out over the crowd face thunderous
when they see his anger the crowd quietens down quickly
brothers sisters comrades i am here because i feel strongly that you made a decision today without sufficient information or foresight
he lectures them like a headmaster
they dont like it
i am aware of your earlier vote
i am aware that it was unanimous
nonetheless i propose that we restore the springboks
restore their name their emblem and their colors immediately
instant and complete silence in the hall
this is utterly unpopular
shocked faces especially from the executive and the nsc firebrand
on barbara as she sees her worst political nightmare playing out in front of her
let me tell you why
murmurs of disapproval and disagreement begin to rise
mandelas going to have to row upstream on this one
on robben island in pollsmoor prison my jailers were all afrikaners
for twenty seven years i studied them
i learned their language i read their history i read their poetry
i had to know my enemy in order to prevail against him
and we prevailed did we not
all of us here
for the first time mandela says something the crowd likes
our enemy is no longer the afrikaner
they are our fellow south africans our partners in democracy
just as quickly mandela loses them again
and they treasure springbok rugby
if we take that away we lose them
we prove that we are what they feared we would be
we have to be better than that
we have to surprise them with compassion with restraint and generosity
the grumbling and disagreement becomes noticeably louder
yes i know
all the things they denied us
on hendrick totally engrossed in his job eyes sweeping across the crowd feeling the tension
but this is not the time to enjoy a moments petty revenge
this is the time to build our nation using every single brick available to us even if that brick comes clothed in green and gold
the crowd is growing more restless and rebellious by the moment
linga is as alert as hendrick tuned in to the jumpy vibe
you elected me
you elected me to be your leader
let me lead you now
who is with me on this
its almost as if hes daring them to go against him
who is with me
the murmuring becomes a dull roar of argument and disagreement
on barbara as she closes her eyes and lowers her head this is a fiasco
as delegates spill out of the conference hall mandelas convoy leaves as fast as it arrived
it almost looks as if theyre fleeing
mandela looks exhausted almost gaunt
facing his own people like that took it out of him
barbara stares out the window chewing her lip totally stressed out
linga heaves a great sigh exhales a truckload of stress
jason and his crew travel in stoic silence
similar silence from etienne and crew
it seems like the silence of defeat
all we needed was one more yes than no
what if you hadnt got it
well as you know i am an obedient party member
barbara snorts disagreement
she is angry at her boss
im sorry madiba but weve got problems everywhere we look
housing food jobs crime our currency
you cant keep interrupting affairs of state to placate a minority
but i must
this minority still controls the army the police and the economy
without them we cannot address the other problems
so this rugby its just a political calculation
life and energy flood back into mandela
he sits up against his seat belt faces his chief of staff
its a human calculation
if we take away what they cherish the springboks their national anthem we just reinforce the cycle of fear between us
on linga in the front seat
hes not supposed to listen but how could he not
i will do what i must to break this cycle
or it will destroy us
the sound of cleats approaching on concrete
the dressing room attendant puts cases of beer cans on a side table rips them open backs away as the springboks enter silently faces miserable shoulders slumped
theyve lost another game
one of the players grabs a beer opens it takes a gigantic this beer tastes like kuk
hurls the beer against the wall so hard it ruptures sending foaming beer everywhere
on pienaar as his eyes flash and he shoots to his feet
its not the beer
pienaar picks up a case of beers goes to the angry springbok
everybody take a beer
this is an order
the entire team takes a beer including pienaar
pienaar cracks his beer raises it up
they all crack and raise their beers
to the taste of defeat
that bewilders his team
and promise yourself never to taste it again
pienaar takes one long swig youre right
it tastes like kuk
tosses his beer against the wall so that it ruptures
eighteen other beers rupture against the wall
the dressing room is awash with beer and foam and re kindled passion
as with mandela pienaar is a leader on a smaller scale
both units crammed into the small office
as usual neither team talks to the other
jason enters with two files
heres the schedule for the overseas trip
jason and the boys look over one etienne and his unit look over the other and discuss it amongst themselves in afrikaans
hendrick says something pointed which resonates with the others
what did he just say
i said he asked when we were supposed to sleep
as well as other basic human functions
if madiba can do it we can do it
mandela addresses the general assembly thanking them for their support in the fight against apartheid
the millions of our people say thank you and thank you again
linga and hendrick are his closest bodyguards
mandela addresses diplomats members of congress black leaders at a made for tv ceremony on the south lawn
i have come here with a message
people of the unites states of america open your markets to us
people of the united states of american come and invest in our country
linga jason etienne and hendrick are in on this one a little island of south africans in a sea of u
we are in a courtyard behind the palace
drawn by four white horses a royal carriage an open carriage pulls up stops
the courtyard quickly fills with liveried footmen then security guards
queen elisabeth and mandela emerge from the palace
footmen open doors on both sides of the carriage
the queen and mandela climb in the queen on the right hand side
when they sit down next to each other mandela leans over and says something to the queen that makes her giggle
for queens do not giggle
the carriage pulls forward and these two human icons sit up straight as they get set to face the world
and in london president mandela made quite an impression on the queen on tv footage of mandela with the queen riding down the mall waving to ecstatic crowds
as he concluded a gruelling trip mr
pienaar mutes the tv so that he can deliver the latest one liner to mrs
in related news it was announced that president mandela will be visiting south africa this week
in the background in the kitchen a plump middle aged tswana woman washes the dishes and keeps an eye on the tv
this is eunice the pienaars maid
she does not find mr
pienaars joke amusing
the presidents jet taxis towards the familiar bmw mercedes bmw convoy
mandela disembarks very slowly
he is exhausted his feet are swollen his knee hurts
this is a very different man than the one we have just seen wooing the world
he is met at the bottom of the stairs by hendrick
its good to be home sir
mandela just nods
too tired to talk
hendrick escorts mandela to the mercedes opens the door for him
mandela takes a step towards the open door and staggers
reflexively hendrick reaches out steadies him
mandela steps out of hendricks hands holds onto the open door
travelling the world begging for money is very tiring
mandela reaches into his jacket pulls a small package out hands it to hendrick
this is for you
mandela slides into the car
once the door is closed hendrick glances at the package
we dont see it
it is too dark
but we do see that hendrick is amazed by it
hendrick is being driven home through the highveld night
he chews on something really sticky chewy
he pauses to dislodge some of it from a tooth before it pulls out a filling
then he resumes chewing
on the bedside table the clock clicks from to
mandelas eyes open in the dark
close for a second
then shoot open again
it takes everything mandela has to sit up and switch on the light
the bodyguards bmws flank the gate
as the gate opens linga gets out of one bmw hendrick gets out of the other
they are alert
it is freezing cold
bundled up against the cold mandela emerges through the gate and they close in on him
it is clear that he is pushing himself physically
i see you father
they keep moving
it is too cold for anything else
how is your family hendrick
top shape sir
how about yours
mandelas smile becomes fixed on his face
i have a very big family
then he stops turns heads back towards the house
i dont think i want to walk today
hendrick realizes that he blundered somehow
he shoots an anxious glance at linga who looks at him as if hed just committed blasphemy
mandela goes through the open gate without a word
the gate closes behind him leaving linga and hendrick to watch him through iron bars
linga turns on hendrick
we never ask him about his family
but he asks about ours all the time
think about it man
hes separated from his wife
how often do you see them here
hes not a saint okay
hes a man with a mans problems and he doesnt need us reminding him about them
linga heads back to his bmw
hendrick stands at the gate looking in at the house
mandela shaves avoiding his own gaze
shaved showered and dressed mandela descends the stairs sits down to breakfast by himself at the big table
he looks at the newspaper headlines which talk about crime rising the rand falling the mandela honeymoon over etc
like any other man mandela turns to the sports section for relief and finally finds something to smile about
there is a picture of pienaar
mandela reacts to it pleased
as a cabinet minister and her entourage leave barbara enters holding an envelope
i like that dress
thank you madiba
this is for you
what is it
your pay checks
you havent been collecting them
mandela opens the envelope looks at a check and grunts
this is terrible
madiba its what de klerk got
plus an increase for inflation
but mandela shakes his head outraged
today president mandela announced that in his opinion on tv throughout his salary is too high
pienaar and nerine watch the news with mr
and mrs pienaar
theyre all overpaid
in the background once again eunice washes the dishes and keeps an eye on the tv
he has therefore decided to donate a third of his monthly income to charity
give me the houses and cars they give him and ill donate a third of my salary too
francois cell phone rings
pienaar you would not
not in a million years
whatever pienaar hears on the phone sends him out of the room in a hurry
hang on a moment please
president mandela said that he wished to set an example to other leaders and cabinet ministers
theyre lining their pockets as fast as they can
nerine is interested in the call that sent pienaar hurrying out of the room
pienaar mutes the tv
must be his girlfriend hey nerine
he knows id bloody kill him
on eunice as eyes and ears alive she finishes in the kitchen
pienaar comes back stands in the doorway a stunned expression on his face
who was it
pienaar doesnt answer immediately
it was his girlfriend
ive been invited to tea
the president of sa rugby
count your fingers after he shakes your hand
pienaar points at the muted tv
on the tv footage of mandela with a group of saudi princes
eunice turns and looks at francois wide eyed
the pienaar family all stare at the tv stunned
he wants me over for tea week after next
eunice picks up her handbag puts on her coat and heads for the door stops when she reaches pienaar
francois you must tell madiba that the bus service is very bad and too expensive
he must please fix it
good night everybody
good night eunice thank you
all eyes on pienaar
what the hell does he want with you
pienaar shakes his head he has no idea
nerines modest little car heads towards the seat of power
pienaar wears a blue blazer grey slacks and subdued tie and is surprisingly nervous
youve met him before
i shook his hand on the rugby field thats all
you didnt even vote for him
hes still the president
hes had dinner with the queen
with presidents and movie stars
all i do is play rugby
what if i pull something stupid in front of him
nerine stops to let pienaar out
gives him a kiss straightens his hair
ill pick you up right here
pienaar climbs out of nerines car
a pretty sizeable knot of journalists rush towards him
pienaar takes a deep breath
he is a bundle of nerves
small office packed with big men
see whos coming for tea
my nephew wants me to get his autograph
who wants to escort him in
hendrick bolts for the door
i know how to do my job okay
whos this pienaar
you cant be serious
hes the captain of the springboks
linga shrugs provocatively indifferent
i like soccer myself
well you know what they say about soccer its gentlemans game played by hooligans
one the other hand rugby is a hooligans game played by ja ja ive heard it before
it wasnt funny the first time
not exactly violin music and roses
but they are talking to each other
hendrick escorts pienaar back towards mandelas offices
hendrick is the bigger man
can i ask you a question lieutenant
ja of course
whats he like
they pause at the office door
hendrick ponders that question for a moment then
when i worked for the previous president it was my job to be invisible
hendrick opens the door
he found out i like english toffee and brought me some back from his visit to the queen
hendrick ushers pienaar into mandelas offices
to him nobody is invisible
hendrick gestures to the waiting area
thats where you wait
one of his assistants will come for you
theres a bathroom over there if you need it
hendrick turns to leave hesitates turns back
what are our chances in the world cup
i mean for real
well do our best
that i can guarantee
hendrick nods solemnly heads back to security
pienaar heads straight for the bathroom
etienne and the other white bodyguards look up
well hes not as big as he looks on tv
and we dont stand a bloody chance in the world cup
pienaar washes his hands dries them dries them again combs his hair looks at himself in the mirror adjusts his blazer
pienaar returns to the waiting area sits
there is a clock on the wall
one minute to four
four japanese trade officials traipse out having just met mandela
the second hand journeys up to vertical
when it hits oclock exactly mary walks into the waiting area
pienaar shoots to his feet
this way please
mary leads pienaar back to mandelas own office knocks opens the door
go on in
mouth dry pienaar nods and enters the inner sanctum
mandela leaps up from behind his desk crosses the room to meet pienaar
francois what an honor
im so excited
they shake hands
thank you for coming all this way to see me
pienaar gulps like a fish out of water
thank you for inviting me
hows your ankle
i was told youd hurt it
has it healed
pienaar relaxes visibly
this is small talk he can handle
this is mandelas gift
the truth is sir you never play at a hundred percent no matter what
in sports and in life
indicating a chair take this one
looking into the light hurts my eyes
they sit in the chairs
a knock at the door and mrs
brits the old afrikaner tea lady enters carrying a laden tea tray
mandela stands again immediately
brits pienaar stands just a beat slower
you are a shining light in my day
eyes twinkling mrs
brits puts the tea tray down on the coffee table in front of them
the finest china cookies on a plate
brits this is francois pienaar
hes the captain of the springboks
mandela clearly expects pienaar to shake hands with mrs
pienaar holds out his hand aangename kennis mevrou brits
gently shakes hers
ek ook meneer
shall i pour sir
no thank you i think id like to
mandela does not sit until the door closes behind her
pienaar only sits after he does
mandelas manners would not be out of place in victorian england
how do you take your tea francois
milk and sugar please
mandela pours tea for both of them
on pienaar as just for a moment he realizes that here he is with the president pouring him a cup of tea
the english have given us many things including rugby but afternoon tea is one of the greatest
mandela hands pienaar the tea cup
thank you sir
both men have big hands
fine china dwarfed and threatened
in the exact moment that both their hands hold the same saucer mandela looks pienaar in the eye
you have a very difficult job
i sell gas braais
mandela lets go and pienaar takes the tea
captain of the springboks
a very difficult job
not compared to yours sir
ah but then nobody is trying to tear my head off while im doing mine
it is not so difficult to get people to do their best
and i imagine that anybody who plays for their country does their best almost automatically
or they wouldnt be chosen in the first place
but to get people to be better than that
better than they think they can be
now that is difficult i find
yes sir it is
how do we do that
to an extent
but there is more to it than that
searching for the right inspiration perhaps
pienaar is engrossed
this is a master lesson on leadership from a master
how do we inspire ourselves to greatness when nothing less will do
how do we inspire everyone around us
sometimes i think by using the work of others
pienaar knows to keep quiet
on robben island when things were very hard i found inspiration in a poem
a victorian poem
but they helped me to stand when all i wanted was to lie down but you didnt come all this way to hear an old man talk about things that
make no sense
they make a lot of sense sir
on the day of a big match say a test in the bus on the way to the stadium nobody talks
everybody is preparing
when i think were ready i have the bus driver put on a song ive chosen a theme song
one we all know
we listen together and
i remember when i was a guest at the olympic games in barcelona
the whole stadium welcomed me with a song
at the time the future our future seemed very bleak
but to hear that song in voices from all over our planet
it made me very proud to be south african
it helped me to come home and do better
it allowed me to expect more of myself
may i ask what the song was sir
well it was nkosi sikelel iafrika
a very inspiring song
mandela looks into pienaars eyes
we need inspiration francois
brown african eyes blue african eyes meet over their cups of tea
because in order to build our nation we all need to exceed our own expectations
something passes between them
whatever it is has a profound impact on pienaar
we probably do
cameras click and whirr as mandela and pienaar shake hands for the press
note that there are no flashes
pienaar walks away from the presidents offices still processing his meeting with mandela
he seems a little stunned and mystified
something profound just happened but hes not quite sure what
when pienaar steps outside and sees all of pretoria all of south africa stretching away below him he pauses
he looks at his country in a new way
a beep beep from nerines car interrupts his reverie as she pulls up at the bottom of the stairs
nerine drives pienaar away
pienaar turns looks back at the union buildings
whats he like
hes not like anyone ive ever met before
an unsatisfying answer
nerine waits for more
but she isnt going to get it without prying it out of pienaar
what did he want
this is the question pienaar is wrestling with too
he thinks it over for long enough to drive nerine crazy
ag come on francois
its like talking to a bloody brick wall
what did he want
pienaar turns in his seat looks at her as realization comes clear in him
i think he wants us to win the world cup
looks down on mandela who is surrounded by his grandchildren in the living room
mandela likes the babies
their parents shoo and shepherd the kids keeping them on their best behavior for the photographers shooting this family gathering
seeing the photographers makes this feel staged
mandela looks past the photographers sees his daughter zindzi glancing in from the doorway and then moving on
mandela disentangles the babies stands leaves
in the dining room zindzi looks down at a big front page she is a modern cosmopolitan young woman
when mandela enters zindzi looks up from the newspaper with a very mandela like grunt
what do you think
it doesnt matter what i think
yes it does
i think he looks like one of the policemen who forced us out of our house when you were in jail
i dont like seeing you shake his hand
and im not the only one
you criticize without understanding
you seek only to address your own feelings
this is selfish thinking
it does not serve the nation
zindzi shakes her head turns leaves
i mandela wants to apologize doesnt know how
instead he pulls an envelope out of his pocket holds it out
will you give this to your mother
what is it
zindzi looks into the envelope
in it is the beaded bracelet from earlier from the bathroom
just throw it away
i dont have the right to
its not mine
if she left it here she meant to throw it away
only children know how to twist the dagger so deftly
mandela turns away so that his daughter cannot see his eyes
a man so at ease with strangers does not know how to talk to his own family
the same newspaper photo of mandela and pienaar that zindzi was looking at only this time someone is cutting it out very carefully
pienaar enters to get something from the fridge sees what eunice is doing
eunice stops cutting
pienaar looks down at the photo for a long moment
he doesnt know how to react to it
pienaar said you were finished with the paper
eunice keeps cutting until the photo can be lifted up
she nods proud
on a practise field at this world class facility the springbok squad about guys sprint to the m line drops begins explosive push ups
note also that at least half of the players who faced the british lions earlier are gone
the world cup is played every four years
sixteen teams qualify from around the world
the minister of sports briefs mandela on the world cup with the help of a big diagram on an easel just like a march madness bracket layout showing all the
the minister looks ragged exhausted
four pools of four teams each playing in nine different venues around the country
two teams will advance from each pool to the quarter finals
mandela studies the diagram
he loves this stuff
the ivory coast qualified
this is wonderful
for the record the sixteen teams who qualified were south africa new zealand australia england scotland ireland wales canada romania italy france japan west samoa argentina tonga and ivory coast
the springbok squad leap up after the push ups sprint to the m line drop begin rapid crunches under the critical eye of the new coach and manager
australia won the previous world cup
new zealand won the one before that
minister of sport contd theyre both clear favorites to reach the finals this time
according to the experts well reach the quarter finals and no further
according to the experts you and i are still supposed to be in jail
that brings a grin from the minister of sport
the coach blows his whistle
on pienaar as he leaps to his feet leads the charge back to the m line
you make a personal appearance at the finals and at the opening match between the springboks and australia
the finals will be broadcast to over a billion people around the world live
a billion people watching us
wheels turning in his yes
this is a great opportunity
hands on their knees sucking air retching the squad has worked their way down the full length of the field
i reckon youve knocked the stuffing out of them today
i havent even begun
we may not be the most talented team in the world but were going to be the fittest
he blows his whistle
the squad cant believe their ears
no one moves
come on boys lets show him
staggering more than sprinting pienaar heads towards the m line
shit whats pienaar been eating
but they follow him
alone in his office mandela looks at the world cup diagram for a moment then picks up his phone
please call the head of south african rugby for me
thirty completely wiped out athletes
some are too tired to shower some have made it that far but are too tired to change
pienaar has showered and changed and slumps next to his locker
the springbok manager enters followed by the rugby pienaar and the boys drag themselves upright
the rugby president looks them over as if they were his very own stable of race horses a stable hes not entirely sure he likes
its good to see you working so hard
i have a short announcement
as part of the pr buildup to the world cup you will be conducting coaching clinics in townships all over the country
the players greet this announcement with complete silence
i know you have plenty on your plates already but this is a request that comes from the top
looking at pienaar the very top
the rugby president turns on his heel and leaves followed by the manager
the players say nothing for a long moment but body language alone shows that they are completely disgusted
this is complete crap
are we some kind of circus act now
we dont have time for kuk like this
the boys are getting angrier by the second
they expect us to play our best to give our bloody all then they add to our bloody workload
the lock turns to chester
what do you think about this chester
all eyes on chester as if the poor guy is a magic guide to a world they barely understand
i try not to think
it interferes with my rugby
the perfect answer for these guys
now theres a rugby player
talk to them francois
make them see that this is a waste of time we dont have
all eyes on their captain who shakes his head no
im not going to talk to them
whether we like it or not were more than just a rugby team
were were ambassadors inside our own country
and we might as well get used to it
then is this you speaking or mandela
pienaars eyes are fierce
he needs them to see how serious he is
you know me better than that
we need to change too
it is clear that much of his team disagrees with him
close up on a tv horrible startling images of the were looking at the remains of the federal building in oklahoma city america which was destroyed today in a massive
pull back to reveal that we are in mandelas offices
barbara mary other assistants look on
so do the bodyguards
all faces stunned appalled
mandela approaches slowly from his office drawn in by the horrible irresistible images
he stands behind his people
no one has claimed responsibility yet but authorities say that the timing and target mark this as the work of white right wing fanatics
an act of revenge for the fbi killings in waco texas
jason and linga share a pointed look
south africa is a global leader in white right wing fanatics
the explosive a truck bomb was apparently a simple mixture of commonly available industrial and agricultural materials
thats all we need
a homemade explosive from materials every boer already has
then jason realizes that mandela is standing right next to him
so far the official death toll stands at over a people which includes at least children from a day care center in the federal building
mandela turns to barbara
please call president clinton for me
i wish to offer him our condolences
mandela turns to jason eyes deep and dark
do you see why forgiveness is essential jason
revenge only begets revenge
as mandela walks back to his office there is a look of utter sorrow on his face
a luxury bus heads along the freeway
the springbok squad rides in style
most are wearing tracksuits most are asleep
pienaar is awake
the same township where sipho rejected the springbok rugby jersey
at one edge we find what passes for a soccer field
just a littered rectangular expanse of highveld winter dirt
tv vans and a very nervous springbok management crew drive to the edge of the field stop get out and are immediately mobbed by threadbare excited kids many of them
begging for cash and candy
sipho in the thick of things
one of the springbok management crew pulls a rolled banner on two spiked poles out of their van
mallet and banner in hand the management crew head to the edge of the field mobbed by shouting whistling township kids
they hammer one pole into the ground unroll the banner seen from the back so that we cant read the words get set to hammer the second pole into the
ground except that there is a smashed beer bottle in the way
broken glass everywhere
they look at the broken glass then turn and look across the field
broken glass glints in the low sun all over the field
they cant play on this
when are they due
plenty of time
he reaches into his wallet pulls out a r note about holds it up high
the kids yell for it
mayhem as kids sprint out across the field hunting for glass
sipho goes for the tiniest most treacherous shards
the bus hits a rut in the dirt road with an almighty jolt which wakes the sleeping springboks
they look out of the windows and see the absolutely hellish outskirts of the township
every possible incarnation of poverty as far as the eye can see
this shocks them
most of them have never been anywhere like this township
shit im glad i dont live here
the driver sounds the horn as they pull into the township
the bus pulls up at the field which is covered with kids on their hands and knees
what the hell are they doing
the driver sounds the horn again and the kids on the field sprint for the bus hands and pockets full of broken glass
dont forget weve got tv cameras on us at all times
what a bloody joke
as the kids approach the bus they dump their broken glass under the banner which reads
brown green white blue shards tinkling and piling up like lethal jewels backlit in the low winter sun
one of the big kids gets the r
attention focussed on until the bus door opens with a loud hiss of hydraulics and the springboks exit one by one
pienaar first with a huge net bag of practise balls over his shoulder
the springboks are all so big so strong so healthy they look like gods or aliens emerging from a spaceship
the kids go quiet awed and uncomfortable
until chester williams steps off the bus and there is a collective sigh of recognition and wonder
now the kids can relate to the springboks
even sipho who looks on from the side of the field
springbok management notes it
the tv crews note it
pienaar notes it
okay chester i reckon youre up
what am i supposed to do
what you do best
pienaar turns to the throng
they all do
pienaar opens the net bag full of rugby balls gives a ball to chester
chester boots the ball out over the crowd high and incredibly far in the thin winter air
pienaar tosses balls to the others
lets do our best
one after another the springboks kick the balls high into the air
go get them
the kids go after them
sipho stays on the sideline
barely controlled chaos
each springbok works with one ball and a group of kids
there are three themes to this montage
first a primer on the basic rules of rugby with demonstrations
who here knows the first rule of rugby
what is it
only hit the other players when the ref isnt looking
a good ice breaker
the first rule of rugby is you can only pass the ball backwards or sideways
note all the rules are demonstrated
if you drop the ball or pass it forwards you scrum for possession
this is a scrum
you kick forwards
various springboks contd if you kick it out of bounds you throw it back in to a lineout
this is a lineout
you score in four ways a try when you dot the ball down behind the try line
thats five points
another two points when you convert the try by kicking the ball through the uprights
three points for a penalty kick
three points for a drop kick
have you got all that
agh bugger it lets just run and pass
whoever drops the ball does pushups
second as the players work with the kids they get into it
much to their own surprise they enjoy the energy they enjoy the kids they enjoy the giving
even the grumpiest most conservative springbok
who wants to scrum against me
one huge man scrums against a horde of kids
he pushes them backwards with a roar then lets them push him backwards
they love it the cameras love it
the third theme shows the emergence of chester williams as the face of the springboks
the crowd of kids around him is twice as big as any other players crew
given chesters basically shy nature he finds it all a bit overwhelming
the tv cameras follow him even more closely than they follow pienaar
at one point an errant pass puts a rugby ball right at siphos feet
he hesitates then picks it up
he doesnt just hold it he feels it
end the montage as the luxury bus pulls away surrounded by a horde of cheering kids many of whom hold new rugby balls under their arms
one blast on the horn one answering cheer from the kids and the bus slowly accelerates away
a cabinet meeting in the rainbow nation with mandela at the head of the table
the minister of the environment is making a presentation about a campaign to put an end to littering by plastic bags
behind him is a very dramatic slide image of a rural barbed wire fence festooned with wind blown plastic bags
and in addition to the nationwide pr campaign we propose that all retail outlets charge a nominal fee for plastic bags mary enters quietly slips a piece of paper in
front of mandela who reads it holds up his hand
minister please forgive me
this sounds excellent and we will return to it but if youll indulge me for just one minute mandela nods to mary who switches on a big tv on the
wall which shows news footage of the coaching clinic in the township
when we see the footage of the lock scrumming with the kids mandela laughs delighted turns to his cabinet
you see that picture is worth any number of speeches
pienaar watch the same report on tv
pienaar has quite a different reaction to mandelas
tell me something how does this help them win rugby matches
establishing shot from the air of cape town one of the most beautiful cities in the world
we see the cape peninsula the harbor the city itself draped around the shoulders of table mountain like a multi colored mediterranean shawl
on its descent towards cape town airport a south african airways jet flies across the view with the smiling face of chester williams painted on the fuselage
this is boland botha coming to you live from cape town airport from a position near an idling luxury bus boland speaks into his mike
where the springbok flight has just landed
on the apron the team disembarks
the boys are dressed in springbok blazers slacks and ties
a magnificent sight
gladiators in top shape faces appropriately stern
people white people clap and cheer as the team enters the building
the green and gold have one week to put the finishing touches to their gruelling training program the team feeds on the energy
they walk taller faster closer together
and i for one have to admit to being cautiously excited
on boland botha next to the bus
i say cautiously because in my humble opinion behind boland the springboks get into the bus fast
this team has been over trained on the field and over committed off it
a beautiful cape dutch style mansion
mandela stands in his home office watches boland on tv
the minister of sports is with him
which makes beating a powerhouse australian side in the cup opener next week a tall order especially since this is an inexperienced team with a history of coming up short
in big matches
this is boland mandela switches off the tv
around the world objectively what are they saying about our chances against australia
everyone thinks theyll beat us
and if they do well have to go through england and the all blacks just to get to the final
so it is very important that we beat australia
to minister of sport thank you
the minister leaves
alone in his office mandela sits thinks gets a sheet of paper with his personal letterhead on it uncaps his fountain pen
over mandelas shoulder we see him write and then underline the title invictus by w
barbara knocks pokes her head in
the cabinet ministers are here to brief you on the trip to taiwan
ill be right out
from memory mandela writes the first line of the poem out of the night that covers me
the luxury bus comes around a bend in a leafy suburb of cape town right under the flanks of table mountain
ahead we see newlands stadium home of the world cup opener between the springboks and australia
a magnificent old stadium in a beautiful setting
all eyes on the stadium as the bus idles past very slowly
this is a coach move
one week boys
excited faces become grave serious
the bus goes quiet
coach nods to himself pleased
the bus pulls away
we stay at newlands stadium and swoop upwards until we are looking down on the stadium and surrounding streets
this aerial shot becomes a big map pinned to a board in the security center
we need snipers on top of the stadium and these surrounding buildings
jason leads the meeting
he uses an old fashioned pointer
all of mandelas security detail present plus local cop not a problem
we want these two approaches completely sanitized
were not going to decide which way we bring him in until the very last moment
we need uniforms plain clothes sharp shooters
and sniffer dogs
no truck bombs no oklahoma city
the locals stir share a look
this is going to be a nightmare
weve got an army unit on standby at silvermine if you need more men
not an option the cops favor judging by their faces
were not taking any chances okay
the presidents going to be very exposed
much too exposed
the silver mercedes tools into cape town past groote schuur
mandela travels with barbara who opens her first file of the journey but is forestalled by her boss
barbara i have been studying
for the summit in taiwan
mandela hands barbara a folded sports section
barbara unfolds the sports section to reveal color photographs of the springbok squad
a collectors pull out
barbara looks at the photos shakes her head
they look like thugs
mandela just smiles at that remark
block out the names
see if i can recognize them
barbara gives her boss a put upon look this is such a waste of time
but blocks out the first row of names
mandela points at the first photo
did i get them right
immensely pleased with this is how i used to study in law school
next photo is of chester unfortunately chester is far too easy to identify
but that will change
the entire springbok squad has been on a training run through cape town on ordinary streets through ordinary people
this is unthinkable in top level sports anywhere else
it really happened
when they are recognized drivers toot their horns pedestrians cheer kids on bicycles ride with them mostly still white
as they approach the hotel grounds pienaar surges to the front so that he can give them a message as they pass through the hotel gate
players only meeting in the team room after dinner
normally a conference room now equipped with fridge pool table ping pong sofas tv etc
the entire team has assembled minus pienaar
a quiet air
pienaar enters holding a sheaf of xeroxed pages begins to hand them out
the players look down at the pages
on a page the words to nkosi sikelel iafrika in xhosa
one by one the players look from the page to pienaar
we need to learn it
we cant just mouth the words anymore
nobody cares as long as we win matches
they do care
its their song not ours
its a terrorist song
they used to arrest you for singing it
and now its one of our anthems
but hes talking to a deeply conservative group of guys
you know i leave my guts on the field for you and you know id follow you into a fight anywhere any time
the hooker crumples the page is about to throw it away
i cant even read it
i definitely cant pronounce the words
one look at his men and pienaar knows he has hit a wall
take it if you want to
the players are relieved
pienaar looks down at the sheet of paper for a moment then looks up at the guys
it means god bless africa
which you have to admit we could use
nonetheless most of the players crumple the pages toss them into the closest trash can
tell us mr
president have you always been a rugby fan
mandela appears with boland botha on his show under a one team one nation banner
people do not realize that i once played rugby myself when i was a student at fort hare
it is a very rough game
almost as rough as politics
shots of booze being delivered to peoples houses all over the country by bottle store delivery vans a very south african alcoholic enabling service
lots and lots of booze
how do you think the springboks will do
i think they will do very well
their level of commitment is tremendous
the springboks train on an isolated field at the silvermine army base outside cape town
tactics and refinements not fitness training
now its been said that you used to support any team who played against the springboks
obviously that is no longer true
i am one hundred percent behind our boys
jason etienne linga and hendrick stand anxiously outside newlands stadium
one of them points to the top of a tall building nearby a eureka
moment for reasons we dont yet understand
after all if i cannot change when circumstances demand it how can i ask others to
a south african defense force helicopter hovers over the tall building next to newlands stadium
in the helicopter mandela jason linga all wearing radio headsets
all wearing suits as if for a state occasion
were going to land you on top of that building
well own the road between it and the stadium
mandela likes it
jason gives the pilot a nod and they take off down the peninsula towards silvermine army base
from the helicopter mandela looks down at his country and finds it good
helicopter against spectacular scenery
mandela points down
jason and linga look
pov from the air they can see the springboks practising right below them on the army base
mandela pulls out the sports section with the springbok team on it
his study guide
he takes a last minute glance at it as the helicopter loses altitude
mandelas helicopter lands at the edge of the field and brings practise to a halt
on coach not happy but whats he going to do
mandela springs out of the helicopter energized excited
linga and jason with him
the players assemble in a loose semi formal unit
not a line but orderly
we may or may not notice that chester williams is missing
pienaar stands at the front relaxed
hes an old hand with mandela by now
francois gentlemen forgive me for interrupting your work the day before such an important match
i just wanted to wish you good luck in person
there is a naughty twinkle in mandelas eye
and sometimes very seldom as president i am allowed to do what i want
they all laugh
mandela wades in amongst them leaving linga and jason behind
picture this behind the barbed wire security of a modern south african military base a tall regal black man in his s is surrounded by huge sweating battered brutal looking
white men mr
president this is i know who this is
good luck andre
shaking hands with all of good luck brendan were behind you all
japie etc every single one of whose names he has committed to memory
statesmanship is often about attention to detail
the players are awe struck
for the record andre gavin james japie christiaan brendan hennie joel johan joost marius james chris pieter garry mark kobus hannes krynauw ruben francois robby adriaan rudolf
cut away to jason and linga who are amazed by what theyre seeing
did you ever imagine this
how could i
by the time mandela has shaken every single players hand he has won the team over coach and manager included
and then mandela frowns steps back looks at all of them
but where is chester
pienaar doesnt answer immediately he looks at his coach first
hes injured sir
were trying to keep it quiet
is he out for the whole tournament
with hamstrings who knows
well miss him
the whole country will miss him
a somewhat sour note to leave on
but its about to be rescued
president sir yes hennie
this is for you
the huge thick man holds out a green cap with gold piping and a springbok leaping above the visor
mandela takes the cap as if he has just been given a holy relic
i am honored
mandela runs his finger over the embroidered springbok leaping across the front of the cap
good luck gentlemen
your country supports you completely
the team applauds beaming glowing
mandela turns to go back to the helicopter
francois walk with me
pienaar walks mandela back towards the helicopter
i have something for you
mandela reaches into his jacket pulls out an envelope with the presidents letterhead on it
gives it to pienaar
this helped me many times
perhaps it will help you too
pienaar holds the envelope stares upwards at the rising departing helicopter as do the rest of the team until coach blows his whistle
enough fun and games
weve still got work to do
jason paces restlessly going over his mental check list making sure he hasnt missed anything
mandela reads scrawls comments signs papers from a big in pile
mary enters with his glass of milk and his pills
its time for bed
i think ill stay up a little longer
the country is excited tonight
you need to sleep
the doctor said
the doctor has no sense of occasion
mandela turns on the tv begins flipping channels
rugby rugby rugby
mandela is sucked in
the coach and the manager
cats on a hot tin roof
theres nothing more we can do
the game plans good
its just a matter of the boys executing it tomorrow
thats pienaars job
its in his hands now
room dark but for one small desk light
pienaar stands at the window looking out across cape town
he is deep in thought
pienaar turns away from the window goes to the desk where under one small light we see invictus the poem mandela wrote out by hand
pienaar begins reading it
there is a soft knock at his door
pienaar goes to it opens it
it is nerine accompanied by a cop
pienaar nods at the cop steps back so that nerine can enter
as soon as the door closes behind her nerine says you know the best thing about you being the captain
you dont have to share a room
nerine gives pienaar a scorching kiss
then responds then pulls away
francois come on
its been weeks
i need to be angry for tomorrow
nerine takes a deep breath nods turns away and sees the poem on mandelas personal letterhead
from the president
how does a poem help you play rugby
the same way your visit does
a massive crowd roars
the wallaby flyhalf runs forward puts his boot into the ball sends it soaring towards the waiting springboks
the springbok lock rises high into the air supported on all sides takes the ball out of the air perfectly just as the wallaby pack closes in and huge men
meet with an adrenaline fueled crunch of bodies
the world cup has begun at last
but not for chester williams
clad in springbok blazer and tie he sits behind the coach the manager and the reserves in the stands and almost succeeds in hiding his utter disappointment at not being
on the field
mandela looks on calmly
the minister of sport isnt late for this match
the president of rugby is pale with nerves
behind mandela stand linga and hendrick
the vip box is a safe place but jason isnt taking any chances
jason prowls through the stadium talking constantly on his radio
back to action on the field
the highlights we see here should match the rugby primer we saw in the township
this continues the education of those who do not know rugby
so for instance we see a ball knocked forward and the resulting scrum
we see a ball kicked out of bounds and the resulting lineout
we see scintillating passing rucking mauling tackling strategic kicking at its very best
both teams are crisp and strong
with shots of the security arrangements snipers lots and lots of uniformed cops inside and out sniffer dogs etc
all overseen by jason with shots of the crowd which unlike the earlier test against the lions is completely and passionately united behind the springboks all commentators talk about the
extraordinary passion of the crowd that day always returning to the vip box where something interesting is taking place right behind mandela linga moonsamy the rugby scorner the soccer lover loses his scowling reserve and gets sucked into the game
when a ball soars between the uprights and everyone in the box groans linga leans towards hendrick and asks what happened
when another ball soars between the uprights and the crowd roars linga asks again what happened
a third ball through the uprights
before linga can ask they scored again
a fourth ball to the joy of the others in the box
a fifth ball through the uprights and the crowd goes wild
were up by three
action on the field as a wallaby drive combining backs and forwards moves relentlessly towards the springbok try line
six times the drive is stopped by springbok tackling but the wallabies keep possession and on the seventh wave of the assault score a beautiful open try which is converted
a ripple of concern goes through the crowd and the vip box
nerves in the box
but not on the field as pienaar starts a drive with a tackle we feel ourselves resulting in a change of possession and a stunning open field try scored in
the corner by the springbok wing who raises his fist in the air after juking the last wallaby to try and tackle him
the crowd roars
in the vip box mandela is on his feet shaking hands with everyone he can reach including linga and hendrick and the waiter
the difficult angled conversion is missed
what does that mean
were only ahead by one
another penalty kick
were ahead by four
a drop goal
an incredible try by the springbok fly half
everyone dares to dream
the classic south african penchant for pessimism begins to abate
two things to note the crowd roar grows and grows and grows and is echoed in the vip box
even jason turns to look at the action on the field but only for a second
also this match serves as the coming out party for the springbok fly half who scores of south africas points this day
suddenly a referees whistle creates pandemonium on the field in the stands and in the vip box
mandela shoots to his feet pushes his chair away and begins the famous mandela shuffle a very cool african boogie that is one of his signature moves
on the mandela shuffle the same shuffle hours later at a vip party
mandela has changed clothes wears one of his indonesian inspired madiba shirts and dances energetically with the absolutely stunning trophy wife of one of the vips
you must be very pleased
what man would not be pleased to be dancing with a beautiful woman like you
president youre exaggerating
my father was a xhosa chief and therefore a polygamist
as you know i am not
but when i look at you
i envy my father
the man is a major flirt and really enjoying himself
but once again he is dancing with a stranger and when we get close to his eyes we realize that mandela is pushing himself way past empty
jason is asleep on his face in his suit and shoes
big party spilling onto the streets
most of the partiers are white
black south africans look on or serve drinks
we follow the crowd into a big sports bar where the springboks are pounding beers and blowing off the steam of months of training grind plus a huge win
even though most of the players are with their wives or girlfriends pretty single women crowd them two and three deep men pay for round after round of beers
pienaar and nerine are part of the action
then pienaar gets a text message which makes him shake his head give nerine a chagrined look
he grabs the springbok closest to him puts his mouth near the players ear and screams again the hubbub the springbok shakes his head bloody coach grabs the player next
to him repeats it
pienaar watches the message travelling through his team and grins
then something catches his eye on one of the big overhead tvs
on the tv news footage of the mandela victory boogie
the boogie is followed by a quick how far we have come type of montage
one of the images shows an island ringed by rough surf
pienaar gets an idea
pienaar leads his hung over sleep deprived team on a very slow jog through the mostly empty streets
when he gets to an intersection he sneaks a peek down at the palm of his left hand
close up on pienaars hand where he has drawn a crude street map
pienaar takes a left at the intersection
another intersection another peek at the map on his hand and another left turn takes the team back onto the waterfront to an idling ferry boat where the coach and
the manager wait for them along with the players wives and girlfriends
i hope youre not that slow next week
pienaar grins stops
the team stops around him
whats going on
a change of pace
the ferry pulls away from the waterfront with the team on board pulling on tracksuits against the cold sea air
it is early winter
the seas are fairly rough
so are the stomachs of the boks who partied hard last night
whos bloody idea was this
on pienaar innocent as a lamb
behind the ferry cape town and table mountain in all their glory
ahead of the ferry one of the most notorious island prisons in modern history robben island lies only eight miles from the mainland
it is two miles long with sandy beaches full of penguins and seals
it would be pretty but for its maximum security prison
concrete barbed wire guard towers
in the political prisoner wing was shut but the island still housed criminal prisoners so the island still had the feel of real incarceration
today it is a tourist destination
as they approach the island a sense of dark history settles over the springboks and their partners
one of the springboks turns to a deckhand getting ready to moor at the jetty
how do they bring the prisoners here
on this boat
the springboks and their partners step onto dry land with some relief look around at the prison humbled
imagine being able to see cape town so close by
that would make it worse
they head towards the prison entrance slowly becoming a tighter and tighter bunch
the ghosts of mandela and all the others who spent much of their lives here are very strong
various shots of the springbok party in the exercise yard the lime quarry the mess hall
none of the usual horsing around
this place affects them deeply
section b is the bleak political wing
tiny cells line each side of a damp concrete hallway
a prison guard shows the springboks into the hallway and they dwarf it as they stand there shocked
shocked at what was done in their names
this group is as quiet as we have ever seen them
can we see the presidents cell
yes of course
leading them down past weve done it up just the way it was
they reach a cell with a piece of white cardboard on the door showing the number mandelas prison number
pointing at the number that means he was the th prisoner admitted in
the prison guard unlocks the door pulls it open then unlocks the metal grill that is the inside door
pienaar peers into the cell
it is tiny
there is no bed just a sisal mat on the concrete floor with a couple of blankets
a chamber pot a short bench a tin cup and plate are the only other objects in the room
a couple of small lockers are screwed high to the wall
the barred window is opaque
it lets in light but does not allow the prisoner a view
when pienaar enters we see how small the cell really is
he can reach out and touch the opposite walls at the same time
this is a bleak horrible dehumanizing place
pienaar is stunned by it
he turns slowly looking at mandelas world for over twenty years
the other springboks and their partners wait to look into the cell themselves a little puzzled by how much time pienaars taking
pienaar almost looks as if he is in a trance
he hears mandelas voice in the cell with him
out of the night that covers me black as the pit from pole to pole i thank whatever gods may be for my unconquerable soul
now pienaar sees mandela in prison clothes in the cell
the image is unclear ghostly
in the fell clutch of circumstance i have not winced nor cried aloud
under the bludgeonings of chance my head is bloody but unbowd
pienaar sees mandela sitting on the dirt in the prison yard breaking up rock with a hammer along with rows of other political prisoners
beyond this place of wrath and tears looms but the horror of the shade and yet the menace of the years finds and shall find me unafraid
pienaar sees mandela leading his fellow prisoners to the lime quarry to mine lime under the eye of a guard who looks like pienaar
it matters not how strait the gate how charged with punishment the scroll i am the master of my fate i am the captain of my soul
the gates open
linga gets out of one bmw hendrick out of the other
we know the routine
only mandela doesnt appear for his walk
linga and hendrick wait for a moment then head in through the gate break into a sprint when they see mandelas form crumpled on the lawn
barbara mary the house staff plus linga hendrick etienne and jason all wait
all are scared
the sound of footsteps from on the top floor brings them to their feet
mandelas doctor descends the stairs
its simple exhaustion but itll lead to worse if its not treated
he needs complete rest
and i dont mean just shifting the affairs of state to his bedroom
no phone calls no visitors no meetings
you know him
he wont do that
then im going to put him into hospital
ill threaten him with hospital if he doesnt behave
ill cancel everything
and ill come back tonight to make sure hes not working
the doctor leaves
the rest of them look at each other relieved
and maybe a little guilty for letting things get this bad
to mary aside dont cancel the trip to taiwan
the door opens quietly
a shaft of light from the door shows mandela on his back in bed eyes closed
the sight of mandela lying like this is chilling
it is too close to what he would look like lying in a casket
barbara makes sure he is breathing
she unplugs his phone takes it
unplugs his tv
sweeps the room for papers articles legal briefs
for the first time she takes an arm load of stuff away from him
she gives mandela one last long look closes the door behind her
we stay behind and look at mandela and ponder south africas fate if this were worse than just deep sedated sleep
chester williams jogs under the tense eye of coach trainer manager and pienaar
he accelerates running fast but not sprinting
thats not good enough
chester opens it up
full sprint sustained
chester is back
lets hope the samoans dont injure it again
one brief shot of a typically brutal samoan tackle and the ensuing foul play in the maul
four quick shots of chester williams scoring four tries
one more shot of the springboks trudging off the field
every single player is bruised or bleeding or both
looking frail but better than before mandela pencils in a score on the world cup bracket diagram south africa western samoa
the diagram shows us that this was a quarter final match
we can see that he has entered all the south african scores
for the record south africa australia south africa romania south africa canada
for the semi finals against south africa mandela pencils in france
on the other side of the bracket mandela pencils in england vs
the all blacks
with a satisfied grunt mandela steps back from the diagram
things are shaping up nicely
a knock at the door and barbara enters ushering in a group madiba this is i know who this is
beaming exuding energy we know he doesnt have mandela rises to yet another occasion
he strides forward to shake hands
welcome and thank you for coming such a long way to see me
monsoon rain batters the bus as it crawls towards kings park stadium in durban
rain rain rain
the field is flooding
coach walks in on his team who are dressed for the match and ready to go
forty minute postponement
theyre trying to clear the field
a hundred zulu cleaning ladies with brooms and squeegees push the water off the field
capacity crowd cheers them on
there will be stock footage
the boys stretch jump try to keep warmed up
mandela and a negotiating team are meeting with their opposite numbers from taiwan
a high level affair that cannot be interrupted
nonetheless mandela takes a discreet look at his watch and we realize that his mind is back home with the springboks
pienaar leads his men out into the rain
a quagmire despite the efforts of the zulu ladies
muddy green and gold against the muddy blue white and red of france
end of a close game
both teams are tired muddy and desperate
the french assault the springbok try line wave after wave
the springboks defend valiantly but slowly go backwards
finally the french score a try or do they
close up on the rugby ball under a mountain of muddy men on the ground three inches outside the try line
the referee waves off the try
mandela flies home still working intensely with a mixed south african taiwanese trade group
mary slips a piece of paper in front of him discreetly
mandelas face betrays nothing
but he gets up
please excuse me for a moment
with mary leading the way mandela goes to the back of the plane looking grave and leaderly but once he is through the galley curtain he breaks into a huge
this is very good
who is our opponent
the all blacks play england tomorrow
then well know
please make sure that my schedule is clear for the entire match
on a big screen tv in a private banquet room the springbok team watches the england all black semi final which the all blacks dominate from beginning to end thanks
to the exploits of jonah lomu their unnaturally huge fast left wing of tongan parentage and unanimous choice for the best player in the entire world cup
jonah lomu scores in the first two minutes of the match the first of four tries
he runs through over and around hapless defenders
his speed and balance are almost unprecedented in a man his size
the springboks go quiet as they watch this beating by the all blacks
mandela watches at home with barbara and mary
lets do some work while we watch
barbara resists her natural impulse to work and says just enjoy the rugby
the sound of the match on the radio of one of the bmws
johan lomus name in every sentence
all the bodyguards are out of the cars enjoying the winter sunshine as they listen to the match
so let me understand this
the all blacks are killing a team that thrashed us last year
thanks for reminding me
hendrick opens the trunk of their bmw pulls out a rugby ball shows it to linga
another lomu try and a ripple goes through the springboks
were going to have to tackle better than the english thats for sure
barbara does some work
mandela comes and peeks over her shoulder are those the judicial appointments for the free state
and barbara shuts the file
theyll keep until after the match
a pile of guns in holsters on the hood of a bmw
suit jackets draped over the side mirrors
in the wide street in their shirts and ties the boys toss the ball around
the white bodyguards handle the ball expertly the black bodyguards for the first time in their lives
give it a spin when you pass it
kwezi catches the ball tries to throw it with spin blows it
the ball bounces crazily all over the street seems to have a mind of its own as it eludes kwezi
they all laugh
lomu scores his third try
how much does lomu weigh
shit thats what i weigh
ja but at least youre slow
as we will discover the wing is going to have to defend against lomu
mandela isnt watching tv
hes at the window looking out at a game of touch rugby taking place on the street outside his house
come and look at this
two mixed teams
hendrick passes to linga who passes back to hendrick who scores
you shouldve played rugby
they wouldnt let me carry my gun
this scene was unthinkable a year ago
barbara and mary stand next to mandela at the window
mandelas eyes twinkle with pleasure as he hears the laughter
in a way this small moment already justifies everything he has done
he gives barbara a sly look
do you still think im wasting my time with the rugby
before barbara can reply excitement on the tv makes mandela turn away
he looks at the tv just as lomu scores his fourth try to make it
mandela shakes his head awed
barbara can you please tell the minister of sport that i need a detailed briefing on the all blacks
barbara gives mandela a long look
this rugby its still strictly political
pienaar hands an envelope to his father
dont lose them
i wont be able to get more
pienaar opens the envelope pulls out tickets to the world cup final
pienaar kisses the tickets
fanning out tickets me mom nerine wait and the fourth
whos it for
pienaar looks at his father mischief in his eyes
bmw mercedes bmw driving from pretoria to johannesburg at the end of the day
red winter sunset over the arid highveld
go boks go amabokoboko signs side by side
chester and pienaar billboards
the all blacks beat ireland to the minister of sport gives mandela his final briefing
at his side barbara thrusts papers in front of mandela for his signature
this continues throughout
they beat wales to they beat japan to
points in one match
linga listens openly
its a new international record
back to the briefing they beat scotland to in the quarter finals
you saw the match with england
and it was not that close
they seem unstoppable
if opposing teams play them straight up jonah lomu runs wild
if they focus on lomu that leaves others free
and also theres the business of the haka
their maori war dance
its very powerful
my sources tell me that half of the all black matches are won before the first whistle because of it
mandela peers out of the window at a springbok billboard
how are we going to beat them
i have the coachs number
you could call him and ask
i dont want to break their focus for even a minute
but how do we win
on linga an idea occurs to him
a wild idea
he almost turns and blurts it out restrains himself
maybe we wont
theyre favored two to one
madiba weve already exceeded all expectations
on and off the field
its not enough
not so close
this country is hungry for greatness
barbara pushes another paper in front of mandela
he signs it
the coach the manager and pienaar gather for a final briefing in the coachs spartan office
hows the feeling in the dressing room
are they talking about him
pienaar shrugs of course
nobody gives us a bloody chance
i like that
it plays into their one weakness
both pienaar and the manager look at the coach
theyre already counting the win
but they want to win with style the way they won all their other matches
they want to show the world how beautiful all black rugby is
i just want to show the bloody world how hard we tackle
pienaars up for that
i wish tomorrow was already here
jason wishes tomorrow was already over
he goes through his plans his check lists for the tenth time
he sighs tries to roll the tension out of his shoulders gives up
he leaves the office
cops at their posts
jason walks alone through the tunnels until he comes to a field entrance
he goes to the edge looks out at the dimly lit field trying to imagine tomorrow
from behind him come on man
theres nothing more you can do today
jason turns to etienne
have i ever mentioned to you that i hate rugby
once or twice yes
i just want to get him through tomorrow safely
we all do
a look between the two men they are united
they have come a long way
as in cape town pienaar stares out into the night pensively
so preoccupied that when nerine enters quietly he hardly turns
i brought one of your moms protein shakes
pienaar nods thanks
nerine puts the protein shake down
she tries to read pienaars mood see what he needs from her at this moment
thinking about tomorrow
no tomorrows taken care of one way or another
pienaar turns to her
im thinking about how you spend years in a tiny cell but come out ready to forgive the people who put you there
we have seen that solitary shape under the blankets before
we have seen the clock on the bedside table change from to before
we have seen mandelas eyes open immediately
but we have never seen mandela roll over and go back to sleep
the two bwms wait faithfully
linga looks at his watch
hendrick does the same
linga gets out meets hendrick at the gate
be an even bigger day if we actually won
then they both look at their watches again
where is he
they share a worried look
linga reaches for his radio
mandelas bedroom door is opened from outside the room
light from the hallway hits the bed
mandela looks very still under the covers
mary peers in concern wiping away sleep
she sees mandela lying there
mary tiptoes in concern growing until she stands over mandela who opens his eyes without moving otherwise
can a man not sleep in when he has a big day ahead of him
marys voice on lingas radio
linga lowers his radio embarrassed
hes sleeping in
linga and hendrick stand at the gate for a moment then turn to head back to their respective cars
i had an idea
its a crazy idea
hey dont worry man
i already know youre crazy
mandela eats breakfast porridge and fresh fruit and looks over the newspaper headlines all screaming about todays world cup final
the doorbell rings and he pauses listens to the sound of voices at the door then the sound of heavy footsteps approaching through the house
mandela wipes his mouth and waits
linga and hendrick appear in the doorway
they look even bigger indoors
what is it
linga hesitates until hendrick gives him a for hendrick discreet nudge
linga had an idea sir
mary walks briskly to her car gets in and drives towards the opening gate fast
linga and hendrick watch as mary drives away
now youve done it
as in cape town the springboks jog through the streets
as in cape town cars toot their horns people cheer
but the crowd running with them is twice as large as it was in cape town and twice as black
this crowd shows that the springboks really do have the support of the whole country now
as the boks rumble past newspaper vendors gardeners pharmacy delivery men on small motorbikes abandon their tasks and run alongside the team
pienaar turns to look at one of his teammates grins gets a grin in return
jason addresses his entire team minus linga plus assorted the tickets sold out long before the team became so popular
so its not exactly going to be the rainbow nation out there
thats the reality
the president will greet the players before the match hell present the trophy after the match
hell be exposed to people twice
hell be on tv live all over the world
expressing his deepest all it takes is one idiot trying to make a statement or one crazy fool who thinks he hears god speaking to him over the radio
one of the cops smiles at that
its happened before
but not today
not on our watch
the security boys are fired up
it is hours before the match but every entrance to ellis park stadium is chaotic with people cars face painters flag sellers fruit vendors
cops everywhere and everywhere outnumbered
in the crowd outside we find sipho collecting empty bottles from trash cans for recycling
jason was right about the demographics of the crowd white khaki clad quite a few old south african flags among the sea of new flags
springbok colors everywhere
we may even see the four boere from the lions debacle earlier
ellis park isnt exactly the rainbow nation today
were at ellis park on this historic day where even this early crowd excitement is at fever boland does another live remote
fans cheer and wave behind because their beloved green and gold have somehow managed to exceed all expectations
a luxury bus pulls away from the hotel with a full police but now they come up against a team that is unlike any other they have played
with that inward look of boxers before a big fight the springboks begin the journey to the stadium
these all blacks are possibly one of the greatest international sides ever with a player in jonah lomu who is as dominant as any this correspondent has ever seen
mandelas mercedes exits his gate bmws fore and aft
to lose to them is no disgrace
to lose to them in the finals is in fact an honor
tight on mandelas face absolutely expressionless
his game face
i say this with absolutely no negativity
i simply want to save people from the heartbreak of unrealistic expectations
back to bolands live remote
so take a reality check sit back and share an afternoon with one billion fellow fans around the world
and as you do feel a special pride in having made it this far
this is boland botha signing off and sitting back at ellis park
huge crowd now all around the tv truck streaming in
driving down a secure access lane the springbok bus and police escort approach ellis park
and pass sipho who stares up at them from the sidewalk
the boys are very quiet until the sheer spectacle gets to them
then the first nerves hit
you can tell in the way they look at each other the way they swallow
mandelas convoy pulls up at a secure entrance
stadium almost full
crowd noise a dull roar
above the springbok bench near the field we find nerine mr
and eunice as they take their seats
pienaar got the fourth ticket for her
eunice turns to mrs
francois doing now
all dressed all warmed up the springboks are quiet introspective
everything that should be said has been said
this is the calm before the storm
note that almost every player wears bandages or braces or is injured in some way
pienaar is not in the room
dressed in his rugby togs pienaar sneaks up the ramp to the edge of the field takes a peek out of the tunnel and is blown away by the magnitude
of it all
vast city seen from the air
zero in on ellis park
another angle of a south african airways flying over the city in the direction of ellis park
final approach captain
let it be noted that im taking control of the aircraft
i assume full responsibility for what happens from now on
the captain drops the nose of the towards ellis park
every seat full
almost every seat filled by a big white man
jason stalks the runways between the seating sections high in the stadium
binoculars around his neck radio in hand
something catches his eye
something in the air
jason lifts his binoculars to his eyes
pov through binoculars the is heading right for the stadium
jason lowers his binoculars
he frowns more puzzled than alarmed
this is pre
he lifts his radio to his mouth
do you see that jet to the east
etienne in another part of the stadium looks eastwards sees it
did they get clearance for this
not from us
the gets closer fast
jason is hit by a horrible thought
where is he
jason finds the vip box looks out at the and realizes that the jet is heading straight at that side of the stadium
get him out of there
mandela is not in his seat
hendrick points at the closed door of the vip bathroom
nothing jason can do about it but hold his breath as the captain drops the even lower
jason has to fight down the impulse to flee
everyone in the vip box sees the jet
they all stand
the nose appears over the rim of the stadium
captain and co pilot go full throttle yank the straight upwards
the almighty roar of full throttles fills the stadium as the passes less than feet overhead so that everyone can read the huge letters painted on the bottom of the
wings this really happened
jason nearly faints with relief
linga and hendrick share a look
they have just had a brush with the unthinkable
the dressing room vibrates with the roar
what the hell was that
which slowly fades
leaving only the background roar of the revved up crowd
the boys jog in place dying for the release of rugby
pienaar appears to be praying silently
the referee walks off the field into the tunnel stands there for a moment then raises his whistle to his mouth and blows a long echoing blast which is the
signal to come to the field
the cop opens the door throws down a full parade ground salute as pienaar leads his men out of the dressing room
with the boks we head down the hallway down some stairs to the tunnel onto the field where the referee holds his hand up like a traffic cop keeping the
boys in a line in the tunnel
as they wait they hear the crunching approach of big men in down the opposite stairway come the all blacks
this is the first time we have seen them in the flesh
huge men black on black uniforms arrogant
been here before done this before
the best in the world expecting nothing but the best from the day
they ignore the springboks dismiss them line up next to them in the tunnel
the sound of thirty men jogging in place in their cleats on the concrete sounds like a drum roll before a medieval battle
the springbok wing sneaks a peek at jonah lomu
the biggest fastest wing ever
even bigger looking in this confined space
bigger than the springbok wing bigger than any of the springbok backs bigger than most of the springbok forwards
the referee nods to both captains turns and leads them onto the field where the already whipped up crowd goes crazy as both teams sprint onto the field and go
through their brief warm up ritual
we focus on the crowd focus on how white and old south africa most of them are
the referee blows his whistle again and both teams assemble in a line facing each other
glaring like boxers across immaculate green grass
seen only in silhouette mandela walks down the tunnel
he is flanked by jason the minister of sport and the president of sa rugby
linga as always has mandelas back
mandela emerges into daylight wearing not a suit not a madiba shirt he is wearing francois pienaars green and gold number rugby jersey
on his head is the springbok cap given to him by the team in the crowd catches its breath
this is unprecedented shocking
the springboks digest this extraordinary display of support
murmuring to pienaar the all blacks wont like that
pienaar nods eyes glinting
mandela is giving them an edge
as he walks towards the waiting teams mandela lifts the springbok cap high waves it and fires his famous beautiful huge african smile at the crowd who roar and stand
slowly and start chanting slowly
south africans chanting as one
all across south africa the chant echoes through empty streets
not a soul not a car to be seen
everyone is inside watching tv
mandela shakes hands with the springboks who are brimming with pride
mandela shakes chester williams hand with special energy
im so glad youre here
in the stands eunice ululates loud african warrior woman call
pienaar looks at her shocked
looks at her as a person for the first time maybe
eunice ululates again
on the field mandela shakes hands with the all blacks who as predicted dont like his partisan clothing
mandela looks up at jonah lomu
lomu looks down at mandela eyes glowing with aggression and suddenly he bares his tattooed tongan tongue in a as do the rest of the all blacks
we have segued to the famous haka a maori war dance that tells an opponent theyre going have their daughters stolen their wives ravaged and their brains eaten right out
of their skulls with a sharpened tea spoon
it is abundantly clear why as the minister of sports told mandela half of the all blacks matches are won before the whistle blows
this is very intimidating
especially because this day the all blacks push the haka closer and closer to the springboks who do not back down
in fact they close ranks and advance
major major international smackdown
this is not fake
the emotions the aggression are real
on mandela whose diplomatic mask slips a little showing a warriors glitter in his eyes
he wants to respond primally
his fists clench at his side
the haka ends with a fearsome guttural maori yell
on the springboks massed together faces red with emotion pulses racing
mandela takes a deep breath in
then the boys answer
with of course a terrorist anthem of their own nkosi
pienaar starts it
sikelel iafrika etc
with decent pronunciation with full fervor and heart the boys roar the anthem back at the all blacks
the crowd joins them
nkosi roars through the stadium through the nation
on mandela his heart swells as he sings with his people
on jason who stands surrounded by his former enemies singing the song that kept him kept all of them going through the apartheid years
in this stadium at this moment all hostility all fear are a thing of the past
the tension finally goes out of jasons shoulders
on jasons face close to tears as nkosi slowly fades
as mandela said a very inspirational song
begin heartbeat over
is that a heartbeat or an african drum
on the field the all black fly half tees up the ball for kick off
as the fly half back pedals slowly and pauses in readiness waiting for the whistle to rainbow nation faces poised all over south africa watching on tv and in the
heart drumbeat over
the last face is siphos
the crowd noise spills out of the stadium behind sipho
a radio plays nearby tuned to the game
the radio is in a cop car manned by two beefy white cops
as the crowd noise rises sipho edges closer to the cops
they eye him out
mandela front and center
minister of sport to his right prime minister of new zealand to his left president of sa rugby next to him
both using all their diplomatic skills to stay cool
to nz p
perhaps we should make a small wager
all your gold for all our sheep
i was thinking more along the lines of a case of wine
behind mandela linga and hendrick suppress grins
they are outwardly professional but bursting with excitement
the referee blows his whistle
the all black fly half boots the ball towards the springboks charges after it along with the rest of the all blacks
we have only seen snippets of rugby so far
and mostly from a somewhat polite distance the usual distance of tv coverage
say at closest the referees point of view
not for the climax
we experience this beautiful piece of mayhem up close and personal
were inside the heaving scrums
we are the ball
we see the way cleats leave a pattern of round white dimples on abused skin which quickly turn to purple as they fill with subcutaneous blood
we feel a tackle in our own spine we see teeth sink into flesh in the intimacy of a loose scrum we feel a hard fist smacking us again and
again in the hot privacy of a rolling maul
for this is not a pretty match not for one moment just as the springbok coach wanted
this match is all about a less talented team stifling the best team in the world by sheer determination and fitness
this is about the springboks applying continuous unrelenting pressure and forcing the vaunted all black attack into making mistakes
lots of them
dropped balls errant passes knock ons
no fluency of movement no electric building of momentum
because of one thing tackling
tackling and tackling and tackling again
the first time lomu touches the ball the stadium the nation holds its breath until the springbok wing scythes into him at thigh height wraps him up and brings him
the second time lomu gets the ball he is brought down from behind by pienaar with a picture perfect tackle
we can cut away to the faces of the spectators when we want from mandela to nerine to sipho and on and on all over the country
but in truth our attention belongs on the field
on pienaar continually exhorting his men leading by example wreaking havoc in the all black backfield
on lomu who always seems just one broken tackle away from running one in except that there are no broken tackles
on thirty big strong battle scarred men who have devoted their entire lives to this moment
they are not playing for money
they are playing for pride for their countries
we miss them
no tries are scored in the final
the two fly halves match each other penalty goal for penalty goal
with each made kick the goal posts shrink for the next
the penalty goals are unchallenged
it is up to the kicker to make them or fail
that is pressure
the score is when just before half time the springbok fly half takes a long perfect pass from the scrum half and with the all black defenders looming kicks a
drop goal through the uprights
the springboks lead
a tight match
so tight in fact that there is only one score in the second half an all black drop goal that levels the score at
until right before the end of the match when the all blacks camp in the springbok half
the scrum half sends a long spiralling pass to the fly half who is in perfect position to go for a drop goal
the kick soars into the air high and straight
million south africans hold their breath
all around the world fans lean forward on their chairs
this will be the decisive blow
but the kick just goes wide
the referee blows his whistle to signal the end of regulation
both teams are spent
what happens now
i dont think i can take it
no one can
everyone is drained
sipho leans on the cop car listening to the radio
he and the two cops suck nervously on sodas
two sets of bruised bleeding exhausted cramping men face each other for the extra time kick off
pienaar turns to his men
whos the fittest team on this field
the answer lies in their eyes they are
an all black penalty goal makes it almost immediately
a springbok penalty goal answers
seven minutes from the end of extra time the springboks earn a scrum deep in all blacks territory
keep it here
run it forward
the scrum goes down wheels a little
pienaar turns his head
the fly half taps his own chest give me the ball
pienaar hesitates then nods to the scrum half give him the ball
the ball goes into the scrum
the ball works its way back through the feet of the eight springbok forwards
the scrum half gathers it spins it out to the fly half who takes one step to his left and kicks a drop goal high into the air
ball soaring past a backdrop of open mouths
higher than the uprights
but through them nonetheless
springboks all blacks
an entire nation jumps to its feet
everyone is on their feet in the press box
how long before the end
they turn out to be the longest seven minutes in mandelas life
in every south africans life
this is where we fold the rainbow nation into the rugby match fully
as we show the whole nation wanting exactly the same thing at the same time
faces postures eyes are identical no matter where they are who they are what color they are
it would be nice if we used all the faces weve already cut away to throughout this story
the all blacks attack desperately
the springboks tackle and tackle and tackle
on pienaar totally spent but dragging himself to his feet for another tackle
he glances over at the referee makes another tackle looks over at the referee the referee puts his hands on his whistle another tackle another look the referee lifts the
whistle to his lips another tackle another look the referee blows the final whistle
the springboks have won
pandemonium on the field pandemonium in the stands
jason is hugged by an ecstatic boer jason is not a hugger
pienaar and nerine are in tears
pienaar hugs a shocked eunice
pandemonium in the vip box
mandela shakes hands with everyone he can find
it is way too loud to say anything
hendrick and linga almost hug
they shake hands with total joy and engagement whack each other on the shoulder
sipho toi tois next to the cop car a township war dance very political
the two cops toi toi with him
around the nation an epidemic of hugging begins
this spills out onto the streets later but for now lets restrict this to the people whove been watching the match together
the springboks say a prayer on the field
pienaar kneels in the middle leading the prayer
behind them a work crew assembles a portable podium
at amen pienaars men lift him to his feet then onto their shoulders
the crowd roars again and again as pienaar takes a victory lap on the shoulders of the men he has led through thick and thin
tears stream down his face through his unstoppable grin
as they near the podium the team is intercepted by a news crew and none other then boland botha
a few words
the interview booms through the pa system
pienaar just nods he isnt about to spoil the moment by reacting to this buffoon
great game but i dont think you couldve done it without the amazing support of these south africans francois grabs the mike from boland
into mike words booming we didnt have the support of south africans today
we had the support of million south africans
the crowd roars
the springbok manager grabs pienaars shoulder points
theyre waiting for you over there
pienaar turns looks
mandela waits at the podium eyes alight with joy
in front of him is the william webb ellis trophy a big gold confection
their eyes meet
their eyes stay locked as pienaar fights his way through the press the officials his own team to the podium
mandela holds out his hand
pienaar takes it
big hands one black one white one with bruises visible one with a lifetime of bruises implied
both wearing the number springbok jersey
francois i want to thank you most sincerely for what you have done to our country
pienaar shakes his head
president i want to thank you for what you have done
eyes lock again for just a moment blue eyes brown eyes african eyes both
and then pienaar raises the trophy high
a very traditional sports heros moment richly deserved
real gold against the green of the battered field
but that is not the real prize
the prize is what happens next all over the nation
all over south africa people spill out into the streets to celebrate
utter joy everywhere as black and white servants and employers strangers enemies foreigners are swept up in love and happiness
people who have been suspicious of each other hated each other feared each other all their lives
they hug each other on this day
housewives gardeners cops kids dance in the middle of the street
a car horn beeps politely
bmw mercedes bmw come slowly down the street
the crowd begins to dance and ululate as they part to let the convoy through
linga in front
mandela is alone in the back seat
he looks out at his people as they cheer him through
he also looks exhausted
none of that shining life force that makes him so big
this routes too crowded
were changing to route b
the convoy switches to another street which is just as crowded as the first with happy south africans
it is as if every single person in the rainbow nation wants to celebrate together
change to route c
the convoy switches to yet another street to no avail
south africa is literally dancing in the streets
mandela leans forward taps linga on the shoulder
tell jason its all right
theres no hurry
madiba says no need to hurry
jason nods puts down his radio settles back with a deep sigh
so do the rest of the boys in the car
this day is almost over
etienne hendrick loosen their ties bask in the feeling
hendrick looks out at the rolling street party and shakes his head in amazement
president nelson rolihlahla mandela undoes the top button of his rugby jersey settles back with a deep sigh and drives home through a nation that has begun the process of
go in on mandelas face as it settles into the now familiar sphinx like mask
except for his eyes
mandelas eyes glow with deep joy and satisfaction as he moves slowly through a moment in history that he has worked for all his life
