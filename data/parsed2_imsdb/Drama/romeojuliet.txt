the red haired driver benvolio keeps his eyes on the road
the truck spirals down an exit ramp and screeches into busy driveway of a large gas station
attendants immediately run to the truck
two clean windshields and duco the third fills the gas tank
gregory in the back seat is boasting outrageously
a dog of that house shall move me to stand
i will take the wall of any man or maid of capulets
that shows thee a weak slave
for the weakest goes to the wall
tis true and therefore women being the weaker vessels are ever thrust to the wall

a moment then from behind the unmistakable sound of a gun being cocked
extreme close up the black cowboy boots
crane up to find the dark cold eyes and feline smile of the wearer of the boots
his name is tybalt a cigarette is clenched between his teeth and his gun is aimed at benvolios head
what art thou drawn amoung these heartless hinds

benvolio a choked explanation i do but keep the peace

i hate the word as i hate hell all montagues and
extreme close up tybalts finger squeezing the trigger

his first shot plugs the fuel tank the second a tire
out of control and spewing gasoline the montague truck careens across the highway and through the glass front of a supermarket
gregory and sampson throw themselves from the truck moments before

the screen fills with flame the following images combust in front of us news chopper p
citizens run in the streets
looters raid shops near the supermarket security guards return fire
a table of dark suited men and their wives

seated next to him is his much younger wife gloria
suddenly windows explode in a tidal wave of glass
diners take cover
capulet moves fearlessly toward the window
to a waiter give me my long sword
close on the word montague fills the screen
pull back we see the word is the number plate of a large black limousine
the limousine is stuck in the traffic snarl bullets bounce off its bullet proof windshield
ted montague a year old red faced bulldog of a man bursts from the back of the limousine
what noise is this
as ted draws an enormous pearl handed revolver caroline his conservatively dressed wife tries to restrain him
thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe
shrugging her off hold me not let me go
crouched behind a truck benvolio shakily tries to re load
close on the barrel of tybalts gun enters frame and presses into benvolios forehead
tybalt whispers sweetly
look upon thy death benvolio
close on tybalts finger on the trigger
benvolio screams a scream of mortal horror
suddenly tybalt is blinded by a burning shaft of light
a magnificently powerful helicopter gunship hovers above him
a command booms from the choppers public address system
over pa rebellious subjects enemies to peace throw your mistempered weapons to the ground
close on the steely gray eyes of captain prince chief of the verona beach police department
he lifts the microphone and repeats the command
throw your mistempered weapons to the ground
tybalt looks up to the chopper
patrol cars screech to a halt
an almighty orchestral chord
super wide shot a trail of devastation winds up through grid locked traffic to the burning supermarket
in the distance looms an enormous statue of christ flanked by two glass towers
we push toward the towers
one is neon crowned montague the other capulet
we hear two households both alike in dignity
in fair verona where we lay our from ancient grudge break to new mutiny where civil blood makes civil hands unclean
from forth the fatal loins of these two foes a pair of star crossed lovers take their life
whose misadventured piteous doth with their death bury their parents strife
a dark chord
a swarm of helicopters thunder into frame
we see compressed time lapsed images of their journey
slam into a coat of arms that labels a large tower the emblem reads verona beach police department in god we trust
close on captain princes grim features
he eyes capulet and montague
three civil brawls bred of an airy by thee old capulet and montague have thrice disturbed the quiet of our streets
capulets lawyer tries to intervene
my noble prince i can
captain prince overriding slams the desk
if ever you disturb our streets again your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace
hold on captain princes determined gaze
a majestic sunrise ted montagues limousine sulks through deserted streets
in the distance jesus looks out over the now peaceful city
ted montague his wife caroline and nephew benvolio ride in uncomfortable silence
caroline finally speaks her anger
o where is romeo
saw you him today
pointedly to montague right glad i am he was not at this fray
montague snorts derisively and stares out the window
embarrassed benvolio tries to be of assistance
madam underneath the grove of so early walking did i see your son
ted montague speaks with contempt
many a morning hath he there been with tears augmenting the fresh mornings dew
caroline struggles to contain her emotion
away from light steals home my heavy son and private in his chamber pens himself shuts up his windows locks fair daylight out and makes himself an artificial night
montague barks into the car intercom
westward from this city side
the limousine u turns heading west
to the melancholic strains of mozarts serenade for winds we see a blond nineteen year old boy sitting alone on an empty beach
close on the boy romeo
looking out over the ocean he sucks on the last of a cigarette and then writes intensely in a small worn note book
we hear his voice over
love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs being purged a fire sparkling in lovers eyes being vexed a sea nourished with lovers tears
what is it else
a madness most discreet a choking gall and a preserving sweet
the limo is parked in a cross street that runs down to the beach
opposite the limo young diehard clubbers faded drag queens and street people hang outside a dilapidated nightclub
a broken neon sign reads the grove of sick amore
ted caroline and benvolio sit watching the silhouette of romeo on the beach
black and portentous must this humour prove unless good counsel may the cause remove
from the limousine
romeo rises and listlessly makes his way up the beach seeing his fathers car he turns and heads for the path that hugs the beach front
so please you step aside
ill know his grievance or be much denied
benvolio clambers out of the limo
close on montague an encouraging smile
the limousine pulls away and benvolio heads after romeo
a deck at the rear of sick amore sprawls onto the beach
at the base of the deck benvolio can see romeo squatting in discussion with an old drunk
benvolio approaches with a not very convincing casualness
good morrow cousin
sore red unfriendly eyes squint back at benvolio
is the day so young
but new struck coz
romeo rises benvolio follows
sad hours seem long
romeo stops as if taking in benvolio for the first time
was that my father that went hence so fast
benvolio chases romeo down the path which divides the beach from a string of cheap souvenir shops and sleazy bars
what sadness lengthens romeos hours
not having that which having makes them short
out of her favor where i am in love
alas that love so gentle in his view should be so tyrannical and rough in proof
alas that love whose view
romeo is halted by the sight of last nights disturbance displayed on a small tv screen in an outdoor bar
what fray was here
benvolio starts to reply
yet tell me not for i have heard it all
heres much to do with hate but more with love
romeo turns the corner away from the beach
he strides along the sidewalk raging
why then o brawling love o loving hate o anything of nothing first create
o heavy lightness serious vanity misshapen chaos of well seeming forms feather of lead bright smoke cold fire sick health still waking sleep that is not what it is
romeo screams at a huge bouncer who lounges in the doorway of a sex club
this love feel i that feel no love in this
the bouncers hand moves to his gun
romeo ignoring him turns on benvolio
a mocking laughter through tears dost thou not laugh
benvolio nervously eyeing the bouncer shepherds romeo out of danger
no coz i rather weep
farewell my coz
romeo breaking into a jog leaves benvolio behind
benvolio pursues him down the street
close on the sleeping face of a fourteen year old boy pull back balthasar sleeps on the hood of a magnificent silver car
three or four kids doze on the sidewalk
as romeo approaches they jump up and begin vigorously polishing the already gleaming car
he springs off the hood chases the kids away then producing a huge bunch of keys opens the car door for romeo
benvolio intercepts romeo at the car
tell me in sadness who is it that you love
in sadness cousin i do love
i aimed so near when i supposed you loved
romeo leans against the car
a right good marksman and shes fair i love
romeo pulls his shirt down to reveal a small shoulder tattoo
close on the tattooed word rosaline
he is impressed a right fair mark fair coz is soonest hit
shell not be hit with cupids arrow
she hath dians wit and in strong proof of chastity lives well armed
benvolio cant believe it
then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste
she hath and in that sparing makes huge waste
benvolio a plan
be ruled by me forget to think of her
o teach me how i should forget to think
benvolio indicates one of the working girls already strutting the foot path
by giving liberty unto thine eyes
examine other beauties
romeo laughs dismissively
he throws the kids a few coins and slides into the drivers seat
balthasar jumps in back
thou canst not teach me to forget
ill pay that doctrine or else die in debt
benvolio leaps into the passenger seat of the moving vehicle
an orchestral fanfare
track down past monstrous letters that read capulet and in through a window to discover fulgencio capulet
he stares out the window toward the other tallest building in verona the one crested with the word montague
but montague is bound as well as i in penalty alike capulet turns on the other side of his desk sits david paris a square jawed young man in a
red cashmere sweater
tea has been served from an exquisite silver tea service
and tis not hard i think for me so old as we to keep the peace
dave smiles obligingly
of honorable reckoning are you both and pity tis you lived at odds so long
an awkward pause dave sips tea then with a deep breath
but now my lord what say you to my suit
capulet considers the framed photograph on his desk
but saying oer what i have said my child is yet a stranger in the let two more summers wither in their pride ere we may think her ripe to
be a bride
dave is politely insistent
younger than she are happy mothers made
checking him hard and too soon marred are those so early made
earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she she is the hopeful lady of my earth
capulet rounds the desk and places a fatherly hand on daves shoulder
but woo her gentle paris get her heart
my will to her consent is but a part and she agreed within her scope of lies my consent and fair according voice
this night i hold an old accustomed feast
capulet leans close
at my poor house look to behold this night fresh female buds that make dark heaven light
hear all all see and like her most whose merit most shall be
capulet smiles knowingly
dave seems encouraged
a hearty slap come go with me
capulet excitedly ushers dave from the office
dim smoke filled
benvolio and romeo play pool
chalking his cue take thou some new infection to thy eye
he lines up the six ball top pocket
and the rank poison of the old will die
a hopeless shot that slams the eight ball toward the side pocket
romeo stops it with his hand and hurls it against the other balls
why romeo art thou mad
romeo sinks the other balls with his hands
not mad but bound more than a madman is shut up in prison kept without my food romeo stalks away from the table
whipped and tormented
he stops at the gun check rummaging in his pocket
good day good fellow
a crusty old man looks up from the small television
his entire face a tattooed shooting target the bullseye between his eyes
the old man points to the sign that reads no ticket no gun
romeo finally produces a ticket
crusty the target goes out back
romeos attention is caught by the television
an ostentatious woman and her over groomed partner rich hosts what looks to be a kind of entertainment tonight show
the graphic behind them reads solemnity nights with susan santandiago and rich ranchidis
susan speaks conspiratorially to camera
now ill tell you without asking
the great rich capulet holds an old accustomed feast rich chimes in a fair assembly
i pray you sir can you read
a list of names begins to scroll across the screen
rich reads them off
signor placentio and his wife and daughters signor martino the lady widow of utruvio and her lovely nieces rosaline and livia
cut to benvolio he leans into romeo
at this same ancient feast of sups the fair rosaline whom thou so loves with all the admired beauties of verona
go thither and with unattained eye compare her face with some that i shall show and i will make thee think thy swan a crow
one fairer than my love
he hands the boys their guns
the all seeing sun neer saw her match since first the world begun
if you be not of the house of montagues come and crush a cup of wine
rest you merry
cut to romeo he considers
ill go along no such sight to be shown
but to rejoice in splendour of mine own
the boys move off
an aerial shot of a magnificent island estate
an italianate wonder of florentine architecture
armed guards patrol the grounds
the telecaption reads capulet mansion
the file tape loses its television quality
we sweep down through manicured gardens where workers prepare decorations for tonights celebrations and into the house
the music darkens and we hear the desperate calling of a girls name
cut to a long deserted corridor
cut to an echoey chinoiserie style drawing room
close on the still serene submerged features of a beautiful young girl
dark floating hair gently frames the face
heavy liquid eyes stare up through the water
we hear though faintly the calling with a rush juliet surfaces
as she gulps air we realise that she is in fact in a bath
we hear the calling loudly again
for a moment she is very still then she closes her eyes and slides back beneath the surface of the water
a gothic unfriendly environment heavy with religious iconography
the entrance hall is crowded with workers and servants preparing for tonights party
gloria capulet fiddles with a short black wig in the hallway mirror
she is attired in full cleopatra costume
dissatisfied with the wig she rips it from her head and calls maniacally
gloria is met by the nurse a fat grandmotherly hispanic woman
nurse wheres my daughter
call her forth to me
i bade her come
wheres this girl
cut to the top of the stairs
as if from nowhere juliet has appeared
she wears a bathrobe and her hair is wet
madam i am here
what is you will
gloria startled sweeps up the stairs and shuffles her daughter toward a doorway
nurse give leave awhile we must talk in secret
gloria shepherds juliet into her opulent dressing room and closes the door
she circles with nervous vexation searching for words stops then suddenly opens the door and yells out to the nurse
nurse come back again
i have remembered me thous hear our counsel
the nurse enters
gloria still refusing eye contact checks her appearance once more in the mirror
she takes a hairbrush and feigning pleasantness intensely brushes her hair
nurse thou knowest my daughters of a pretty age
to juliet thou wast the prettiest babe that eer i nursed
the hair brush clatters onto the dresser
a moment of tense silence
gloria grips herself and pours a sherry
back still turned she speaks to her daughter
by my count i was your mother much upon these years that you are now a maid
a nembutal twists like a pin in the corner of glorias mouth
she slugs it down with the sherry and turns abruptly to face juliet
thus then in brief the valiant paris seeks you for his love
cut to juliet an uncomprehending stare
the nurse caught off guard tries to buoy the situation
a man young lady
lady such a as all the world why hes a man of wax
the medication takes immediate effect upon gloria
she joins juliet on the couch and coos in pariss favour
veronas summer hath not such a flower
nay hes a flower in faith a very flower
this night you shall behold him at our feast read oer the volume of young paris face and find delight writ there with beautys pen
this precious book of love this unbound lover to beautify him only lacks a cover
so shall you share all that he doth possess by having him making yourself no less
gloria probes juliets thoughts
can you like of paris love
juliet adept at negotiating her mothers strange moods chooses her words precisely
ill look to like if looking liking move but no more deep will i endart mine eye than your consent gives strength to make it fly
peter the chauffeur enters
the guests are come
checks the mirror we follow thee
she exits nurse in tow
close on juliet stares out the windows and across the water
suddenly the nurses face leers into shot
she whispers enthusiastically into juliets ear
go girl seek happy nights to happy days
close on juliets face
jump cut aerial shot of capulet mansion
we time lapse from late afternoon to night fairy lights illuminate guests appear music swells and a single incandescent flare explodes pink against the inky sky
close on romeo his face glows pink
he is sitting on the grubby shoreline of verona bay dressed as a boy king arthur with fake chain mail and sword
romeo watches the dying flare sink into the bay
the sound of the party drifts across the water
balthasar dressed as frankensteins monster touches a lighter to a large bong and romeo inhales smoke
behind them benvolio drunk and dressed as a pizza is yelling at gregory who dressed as a viking is trying to cut slices off his pizza costume
sampson also dressed as a viking sits in the back of a car
one arm is bandaged and he swigs from a bottle
suddenly the darkness is slashed by headlights
a reckless sports car speeds toward the boys
stereo screaming the car skids to a halt
close on music blares from the sound system
a silver stilettoed foot emerges from the car and plants itself firmly in the dirt
cut to the boys eyes wide with amazement
cut to another stiletto follows the first
pan slowly up a shapely pair of black stockinged legs past a hint of garter belt to a black sequined mini skirt and up over a muscular dark skinned stomach
and tiny sequined bra top to discover the year old male african american face of mercutio
cut to the boys
recovering from the initial shock they laugh and cat call raucously
cut to mercutio
he roughly jams a short black wig onto his head and yells above the music
mercutio magically produces invitations from somewhere within his mini skirt and dances down the beach to the boys
aggressively bumping and grinding mercutio distributes the invitations
reaching romeo he declares well on without apology
romeo lets the invitation fall to the sand
i am not for this ambling
being but heavy i will bear the light
romeo pulls on the bong once more
suddenly mercutio is upon romeo
hauling him to his feet he waltzes him through the sand
nay gentle romeo we must have you dance
romeo pushes mercutio away
not i believe me
you have dancing shoes with nimble soles
i have a soul of lead
mercutio in mock sympathy
too great oppression for a tender thing
is love a tender thing
it is too rough too rude too boisterous and it pricks like thorn
romeo lies staring up at the stars
if love be rough with you be rough with love
mercutio jumps on romeo
prick love for pricking and you beat love down
romeo fights mercutio off
under loves heavy burden do i sink
cut to benvolio impatiently honking the horn
every man betake him to his legs
mercutio heads romeo toward the car
come we burn daylight ho
romeo pulls away
but tis no wit to go
mercutio turns exasperated
why may one ask
i dreamt a dream tonight
and so did i
well what was yours
that dreamers often lie
in bed asleep while they do dream things true
mercutio produces a tiny gold pill case
o then i see queen mab hath been with you
she is the fairies midwife and she comes in shape no bigger than an agate on the forefinger of an alderman drawn with a team of little atomies over mens
noses as they lie asleep
tantalisingly he passes the case beneath romeos nose
her chariot is an empty hazelnut her wagoner a small gray coated gnat
with a conjurers dexterity mercutio extracts a small gray pill
and in this state she gallops night by night through lovers brains and then they dream of love he palms the pills
it reappears from behind romeos ear
oer lawyers fingers who straight dream on fees oer ladies lips who straight on kisses dream which oft the angry mab with blisters plagues
because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are
the pill box glints in the moonlight
sometime she driveth oer a soldiers neck and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats
and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two and sleeps again
mercutio now intensely angry this is that very mab that plaits the manes of horses in the night and bakes the elf locks in foul sluttish hairs he screams into
this is the hag when maids lie on their backs that presses them and learns them first to bear making them women of good carriage
this is she this is she
close on mercutio
he breaks off
there is a strange stillness amongst the group
romeo goes to his friend
peace peace mercutio peace
thou talkest of nothing
mercutio meets romeos gaze
true i talk of dreams which are the children of an idle brain begot of nothing but vain fantasy
which is as thin of substance as the air and more inconstant than the wind who woos even now the frozen bosom of the and being angered puffs away from
turning his attention to the dew dropping south
cut to benvolio in the car
the alcohol has caught up with him and he looks a little queasy
this wind you talk of blows us from supper is done and we shall come too late
romeo looks toward the distant city
i fear too early for my mind some consequence yet hanging in the shall bitterly begin his fearful with this nights revels and expire the term of a despised life
closed in my breast by some vile forfeit of untimely death
pause the water turns golden as fireworks explode across the bay
but he that hath the steerage of my direct my sail
he takes the pill and drops it into his mouth
on lusty gentlemen
with the rush of a mind altering cocktail we zoom in on romeos eyes they shimmer with the shooting star reflection of exploding fireworks a bending eastern chord we launch
into donna summers i feel love sung by the vocalist from soundgarden with orchestration by deconstruction and sitar by ravi shankar
pull out from romeos eyes
he is lying in the passenger seat of mercutios convertible as it rockets along the freeway
the camera is directly above romeo
he stares up at the fireworks that reflect in the windshield
the car and freeway begin to rotate and the camera follows
we feel that the car is now travelling upside down
the camera sways through a brilliant explosion of fireworks that fill the screen with a zillion pixilating colored dots of fire
pull out to discover the glittering dots of fire refracting from the sparkling domed roof of the magnificently ornate capulet ballroom
the camera swoops down over bizarrely costumed revellers cavorting to a driving latin big band
the camera partners with a drugged mercutio and benvolio who shamelessly caper with each other in a mock antic adagio
cut to romeo gazing blankly at the dance floor
cut to mercutio
he sweeps up a thirty something sophisticate and twirls her in romeos direction
everyman betake him to his legs
romeo moves off through the crowd
cut to romeos p
contorted images of costumed guests eat drink and laugh in a grotesque collision of yves saint laurent cocktail party and bacchanalian romp
suddenly a large arm coils around romeos neck
distorted extreme close up a seriously intoxicated fulgencio capulet his puffy red face squeezes against romeos
ah i have seen the day that i tell a whispering tale in a fair ladies ear
such as would please
capulet screams above the music come musicians play
blood drums in romeos ears
breaking free from capulets grasp as he pushes through the crowd toward the bathroom
silent underwater shot
romeos tranquil features submerged in a basin of water
with a gasp romeo rises
his breathing calms
then smoothing water into his hair he gazes into the bathroom mirror
he turns the entire wall opposite the mirror is a magnificent salt water fish tank
romeo drawn by its submarine beauty leans against the fish tank
applause echoes faintly through the bathroom speakers
as the applause dies a dark haired latina diva takes the spotlight
the band ease into the opening bars of a love ballad
as the music swells romeo watches a moustached catfish glide past a medieval castle
suddenly romeo pulls away
peering back at him through the castle is a pair of exquisitely beautiful angelic eyes
the divas first pure achingly beautiful notes soar
confused romeo looks again
there is no mistake it is a girl
through a shimmering curtain of ribbon weed two dark wide eyes a childish nose and sumptuous full lips
romeo pushes his face closer to the glass
the other face snaps abruptly away
cut to juliet dressed as an angel on the other side of the tank
we now realise that the girls powder room and the boys bathroom are divided by this watery wonder world
juliet warily moves closer to the glass
romeo leans his face against the glass
the love ballad builds
slow track from romeos profile in through the water and
out the other side to find juliet in profile peering into the tank
romeo presses his nose lightly against the glass
juliet a tiny smile
the door slams open
juliet turns startled
it is the nurse
juliet your mother calls
the nurse bustles juliet out the door
juliet looks over her shoulder at the mystery boy
romeo now without his mask slams out of the bathroom juliet and the nurse have disappeared into the crowd
cut to juliet being dragged along by the nurse
she glances back toward the mystery boy but he is gone
juliet and the nurse rejoin dave paris who is dressed as an astronaut and gloria at the side of the dance floor
dave irresistible smile extends his hand to juliet
will you now deny to dance
juliet looks to dave desperately searching for a reason to decline
gloria brushing aside her silly daughters protests slugs the last of her champagne and corrals them onto the dance floor
whispering to juliet a man young lady such a man
as juliet is dragged onto the floor her eyes furtively search for the boy
cut to romeo in the crowd
desperate to find the girl he roughly shunts aside a reveller dressed as lucifer prince of darkness
hold on lucifer
he removes his mask it is tybalt
he turns to abra whos dressed as a demon
what dares the slave come hither to fleer and scorn at our solemnity
now by the stock and honor of my to strike him dead i hold it not a sin
tybalt moves off aggressively but is halted as capulet slams a hand into his chest
why how now kinsman wherefore storm you so
uncle this is that villain romeo
a montague our foe
capulet peers across the ballroom
young romeo is it
content thee gentle coz let him alone
i would not for the wealth of all this town here in my house do him disparagement
therefore be patient take no note of him
tybalt cant believe it
ill not endure him
close on capulet exploding with rage
he shall be endured
slapping tybalt viciously what goodman boy
i say he shall
capulet violently shoves tybalt to the ground
youll make a mutiny among my guests
a middle aged couple look on shocked capulet waves to them what
cheerly my hearts
capulet snorts at tybalt in disgust
youll not endure him
am i the master here or you
smoothing his hair into place capulet turns back into the ballroom
close on tybalt choking back tears of rage
cut to romeo moving through the crowd
for a moment the crush clears and he spies the angel on the dance floor
close on romeo whispers did my heart love till now
forswear it sight
for i neer saw true beauty till this night
romeo begins to circumnavigate the dance floor in an attempt to get closer to juliet
cut to dave slow dancing with juliet
juliets eyes search the room for the boy
close on romeo
close on juliet
their eyes connect
juliet looks quickly back to dave who oblivious returns his most devastating smile
cut to the songstress her voice soars
cut to juliet
unable to look away from the boy she stares over daves shoulder
cut to romeo
ignoring the danger he continues to move toward the angel
with the divas spiralling final notes the ballad concludes
a complete black out
as the crowd break into wild applause juliets eyes search the darkness but the boy is gone
the crowd cheers and screams its applause
an avalanche of balloons tinsel and confetti rains down from the roof swathes of red silk drop from the ceiling and the space is transformed
close on juliet searching for the boy
suddenly a gasp juliets eyes widen shocked
in the dark a hand has shot out from the drape curtaining off the stage and clasped hers
juliet barely dares breathe
she glances furtively to dave paris he watches the stage
slowly juliet turns toward the hand there through a break in the curtain she can see eye cheek and lips of the mystery boy
as the diva reprises the chorus romeo gently pulls juliet behind the curtain
concealed from the party by the red velvet drape hands still clasped the teenagers are so close their bodies almost touch
if i profane with my unworthiest this holy shrine the gentle sin is this
my lips two blushing pilgrims ready stand to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss
romeo moves his lips toward juliets
she stops him
good pilgrim you do wrong your hand too much which mannerly devotion shows in this
for saints have hands that pilgrims hands do touch and palm to palm is holy palmers kiss
have not saints lips and holy palmers too
a gentle scolding ay pilgrim lips that they must use in prayer
o then dear saint let lips do what hands do they pray grant thou lest faith turn to despair
saints do not move though grant for prayers sake
then move not while my prayers effect i take
he kisses her
thus from my lips by thine my sin is purged
then have my lips the sin that they have took
sin from my lips
o trespass sweetly urged
give me my sin again
he kisses her
you kiss by th book
they kiss again
suddenly a harsh light falls across the entwined couple
they break apart nurse has pulled open the curtain and stands eyeing them severely
madam your mother craves a word with you
we see that the party is breaking up
but for groups of die hard revellers the room is nearly empty
come lets away
she takes firm control of her charge
juliet furtively motions for the startled romeo not to follow as he trails them across the room
cut to romeos p
the nurse and juliet reach the door but instead of leaving they turn and ascend the staircase that arcs around to the mezzanine level
they join a vexed gloria capulet who clings to a patient dave paris
inaudible words are exchanged
juliet flickers her eyes nervously to romeo
cut to romeo
he halts at the foot of the stairs unsure
cut to gloria
catching juliets interest in the boy she indicates to her daughter to come along
cut to romeo a dawning realisation
under his breath is she a capulet
cut to juliet
she stops and turns back
cut to romeo comprehending the reality of who she is
cut to juliet
the nurse whispers in her ear
his name is romeo and a montague the only son of your great enemy
an orchestral treatment of joy divisions love will tear us apart swells hold on juliet
like a cloud passing across the sun a dark coldness descends upon her
cut to mercutio
he throws himself upon the shell shocked romeo
away begone the sport is at its best
mercutio shuttles romeo toward the door
ay so i fear a covert glance over his shoulder
the more is my unrest
mercutio bundles romeo through the front door and down the stairs to the waiting getaway car
cut to juliet
manoeuvred by the nurse up the stairs she breaks away and rushes to a tiny windowed alcove
cut to mercutios convertible and its noisy confederacy joining the line of departing limos
a huge sign combusts into blinding fireworks that write in giant words capulet
as the convertible passes beneath the blazing words romeo turns
through a deluge of falling sparks he glimpses the mystery girl high up in the tower
close on juliet leaning out of the tower window
brilliant sparkles light in her eyes
push in we hear her secret whisper my only love sprung from my only hate
too early seen unknown and known too late
prodigious birth of love it is to me cut to juliets p
in slow motion romeo through the falling curtain of fiery embers
that i must love a loathed enemy
warm wind blows the smoke from the expended fireworks
juliet closes the window and leans against the glass
crane down the side of the building past revellers who dont know when to leave
standing in the front doorway is someone else who cannot take their eyes off the departing romeo
it is tybalt
the music darkens as we push through the smoky wind
i will withdraw
but this intrusion shall now seeming sweet convert to bitterest gall
caught in the jam of departing vehicles mercutios car crawls along the bridge that links capulet island with the mainland
the boys sing along raucously with the radio
i am a pretty piece of flesh i am a pretty piece of flesh
push in on romeo he whispers can i go forward when my heart is here
turn back dull earth and find thy centre out
romeo leaps from the car
benvolio yells after him
romeo runs back along the bridge toward the estate
at the gates armed guards supervise the exodus of vehicles
romeo uses the traffic to shield himself from view
romeo leaps from the bridge and into the shadows at the base of the high stone wall that borders the compound
mercutios car prowls back along the bridge
the last guests have departed and the gates are swinging shut
the convertible halts in front of them
he ran this way
call good mercutio
nay ill conjure too
mercutio leaps from the car
he postures like a magician in a low budget variety special
the boys cheer him on
i conjure thee by rosalines bright eyes by her high forehead and her scarlet lip by her fine foot straight leg and quivering thigh
and the demesnes that there adjacent lie that in thy likeness thou appear to us
close on romeos fake chain mail shirt tangled in the barbed wire at the top of the wall
pan down romeo now on the other side of the wall pulls up his undershirt and gingerly inspects the cuts inflicted by the wire
mercutios cavorting echoes from the bridge
romeo smiles ironically
he jests at scars that never felt a wound
romeo moves off through the darkened grounds of capulet estate
the boys laugh hysterically as mercutio staggers around the bridge in imitation of a love sick fool
o romeo that she were o that she an open arse and thou a poperin pear
the hilarity is abruptly arrested as a security spotlight blazes to life pinning mercutio in its beam
the sound of automatic weapons cocking pierces the night
close on mercutio
hes brave but not stupid
he gets back into the car
come shall we go
close on a pair of stone cherubs on top of the retaining wall of a terraced garden
romeos face appears between them
romeo hauls himself up onto the wall
below is a greco roman style pool area
to the right the darkened rear wing of capulet mansion
suddenly the back of the house explodes with light
romeo takes cover
but soft what light through yonder window breaks
romeos question is answered as out onto the verandah comes juliet
she is still clad in her angel robe but without the halo and wings
she slowly descends to pool level
it is the east and juliet is the sun
arise fair sun and kill the envious moon who is already sick and pale with that thou her maid art far more fair than she
be not her maid since she is envious
her vestal livery is but sick and green and none but fools do wear it
juliet stands on the top step of the pool stairs
she is directly below romeo as he whispers
cast it off
juliet sits on the edge of the pool her legs dangle in the water
it is my lady
o it is my love
o that she knew she were
o speak again bright angel
juliet looks longingly toward the stars
o romeo romeo
whyfore art thou romeo
deny thy father and refuse thy name
or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love and ill no longer be a capulet
close on romeo
shall i hear more or shall i speak at this
tis but thy name that is my enemy
thou are thyself though not a montague
it is not hand nor foot nor arm nor face nor any other part belonging to a man
o be some other name
whats in a name
that which we call a rose by any other word would smell as sweet
so romeo would were he not romeo called retain that dear perfection which he owes without that title
romeo doff thy name and for thy name which is no part of thee take all myself
romeo wildly calls i take thee at thy word
call me but love and ill be new baptised
henceforth i never will be romeo
romeo jumps down from the wall
juliet screams and turns toppling backwards
romeo grabs her hand but her momentum overbalances him and they both plunge headlong into the pool
underwater shot a slow motion phosphorescent tangle of arms legs and bodies
cut to a security guard
alerted by the noise he moves toward the pool area
cut to above water real time romeo and juliet surface spluttering
juliet thrashes the water in an attempt to get distance from her attacker
what man art thou that thus bescreened in night so stumblest on my counsel
romeo a calming gesture as he tries to tread water
by a name i know not how to tell thee who i am my name dear saint is hateful to because it is an enemy to thee
the ferocious barking of a guard dog arrests the teenagers attention
a moment then they slide beneath the water
cut to the security guard and dog appearing above the pool area
the rippling surface of the water
cut to underwater shot romeo and juliet submerged hair streaming stare at each other like two beautiful fish
cut to the guard
he can see noisy caterers cleaning up around the other side of the house
frowning he returns the way he came
cut to romeo and juliet
gasping for air they cautiously surface
a moment then juliet a small smile
art thou not romeo and a montague
neither fair maid if either thee dislike
juliet looks nervously toward the house
she drags romeo toward a small grotto at the end of the pool
how camst thou hither tell me and whyfore
the garden walls are high and hard to climb and the place death considering who thou art
with splashy bravado with loves light wings did i oer perch these walls
for stony limits cannot hold love out and what love can do that dares love attempt
therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me
juliet drags romeo firmly into the grotto
a real fear if they do see thee they will murder thee
romeo slowly pulls juliet toward him
i have nights cloak to hide me from their eyes
and but thou love me let them find me here
my life were better ended by their than death prorogued wanting of thy love
the lovers kiss long and deep
then juliet suddenly fearful pushes romeo away
thou knowest the mask of night is on my face else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek for that which thou hast heard me speak tonight
fain would i dwell on form fain fain deny what i have spoke
but farewell compliment
dost thou love me
romeo tries to speak juliet silences him
i know thou wilt say ay and i will take thy word
yet if thou swearest thou mayst prove false
o gentle romeo if thou dost love pronounce it faithfully
or if thou thinkst i am too quickly won ill frown and be perverse and say thee nay so thou wilt woo
but else not for the world
in truth fair montague i am too fond and therefore thou mayst think my haviour light
but trust me gentleman ill prove more true than those that have more cunning to be strange
lady by yonder blessed moon i vow that tips with silver all these fruit tree tops o swear not by the moon th inconstant moon that monthly changes in her
circled orb lest that thy love prove likewise variable
what shall i swear by
do not swear at all
or if thou wilt swear by thy gracious self which is the god of my idolatry and ill believe thee
she touches his cheek
romeo moves his lips close
if my hearts dear love confused juliet breaks away
well do not swear
although i joy in thee i have no joy of this contract tonight
it is too rash too unadvised too too like the lightning which doth cease to be ere one can say it lightens
sweet good night
this bud of love by summers ripening breath may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet
good night good night
as sweet repose and rest come to thy heart as that within my breast
she rushes up the stairs romeo follows desperately
o wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied
juliet a shocked look
what satisfaction canst thou have tonight
close on romeo
the exchange of thy loves faithful vow for mine
close on juliet
she runs joyously to romeo
i gave thee mind before thou didst request it
kissing him passionately
and yet i would it were to give again
wouldst thou withdraw it
for what purpose love
but to be frank and give it thee again
they kiss again
the nurse calls from inside
juliet looks to the house
three words dear romeo and good night indeed
if that thy bent of love be honourable
thy purpose marriage send me word tomorrow by one that ill procure to come to thee where and what time thou wilt perform the rite and all my fortunes at
thy foot ill lay and follow thee my lord throughout the world
i come anon but if thou meanest not well i do beseech thee
to nurse by and by i come
to cease thy strife and leave me to my grief
tomorrow will i send
romeo holds juliets gaze
so thrive my soul
juliet breaks away
a thousand times good night
with a final kiss juliet runs inside
a thousand times the worse to want thy light
love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books but love from love toward school with heavy looks
juliet re appears at the upper balcony
what oclock tomorrow shall i send to thee
by the hour of nine
juliet unclasps a delicate silver necklace from around her neck
i will not fail
tis twenty year till then
parting is such sweet sorrow
that i shall say goodnight till it be morrow
she lets the necklace fall from her hand
romeo catches it and she is gone
sleep dwell upon thine eyes peace in thy breast would i were sleep and peace so sweet to rest
morning sunlight filters through the lush foliage of a tropical rainforest
pan down as we hear o mickle is the powerful grace that in plants herbs stones and their true qualities
we discover the intensely concentrating features of father laurence
fifties wiry and wearing a priests collar laurence delicately makes an incision in the bulb of a small purple flowered plant
a pair of fresh faced ten year old boys look on in wonderment as a vivid blue sap oozes from the incision
within the infant rind of this weak poison hath residence and medicine power
pull back the priest carefully gathers the sap into a beaker
we discover that we are in a small tropical greenhouse
to the boys for this being smelt with that part cheers each part being tasted stays all senses with the heart
the boys follow the father as he moves out of the greenhouse and into an adjoining work area
the walls are lined with bottles of herbs and dried plants and a television flickers in the corner
for naught so vile on the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give with the precision of a chemist father laurence funnels the sap into
a small bottle and places it in the refrigerator
from out of the refrigerator he produces a large jar of candy
he eyes the boys sternly
nor aught so good but strained from that fair use revolts from true birth stumbling on abuse
the boys take their candy and scram
cut to the muted television
a morning news program shows footage of a murder scene cordoned off with police tape
a distraught mother is being restrained
close on the priest contemplating the television
two such opposed kings encamp them in man as well as herbs grace and rude will and where the worser is predominant full soon the canker death eats up that
a feverish knocking breaks the priests reverie
good morrow father
father laurence snaps off the television and exits the workroom
romeo dressed in last nights chain mail pounds desperately on a wooden door set into a high stone wall
good morrow father
from the workroom father laurence enters a courtyard which encloses a tranquil tropical garden
he opens a door in the wall of the courtyard and smiles as the costumed romeo bursts in
what early tongue so sweet saluteth me
without pausing the priest continues through the courtyard and toward the church
young son it argues a distempered so soon to bid good morrow to thy bed
or if not so then here i hit it right our romeo hath not been in bed tonight
the priest enters the back of the church
romeo on fire to tell of his experience follows the priest into the sacristy
the last is true
the sweeter rest was mine
he stops god pardon sin
wast thou with rosaline
with rosaline my ghostly father
i have forgot that name and that names woe
the father lays out the cut glass bottles and communion tray for mass
thats my good son
but where hast thou been then
unconsciously romeo helps the priest prepare
it is clear he knows the routine by heart
i have been feasting with mine enemy where on a sudden one hath wounded me
thats by me wounded
both our within they help and holy physic lies
buttoning a long black cassock be plain good son and homely in thy drift
riddling confession finds but riddling shrift
then plainly know my hearts dear love is set on the fair daughter of rich capulet
we met we wooed and made exchange of vow ill tell thee as we pass
but this i pray that thou consent to marry us today
cut to the priest thunderstruck
the two kids now dressed in red altar boy robes enter
good morrow romeo
the apoplectic priest waves the boys away
they get the message and bolt
holy saint francis
what a change is here
is rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon foresaken
young mens love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes
thou chidst me oft for loving rosaline
very angry for doting not for loving pupil mine
i pray thee chide me not
her i love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow
the other did not so
o she knew well thy love did read by rote that could not spell
the father falls into a chair and considers
he looks through the sacristy door to where a small childrens choir has assembled
their angelic voices soar into the purest of hymns
how can you just leave me standing alone in a world so cold maybe im just too demanding maybe im just like my father too bold maybe youre just like
my mother shes never satisfied
why do we scream at each other
this is what it sounds like when doves cry
we recognise the hymn as when doves cry by prince
push in on the priest moved he looks to romeo
but come young waverer come go with me
in one respect ill thy assistant be
for this alliance may so happy to turn your households rancor to pure love
romeo hurriedly assists the priest with his vestments
o let us hence
i stand on sudden haste
father laurence holds romeo in his powerful gaze
wisely and slow
they stumble that run fast
the procession is joined by the two little altar boys and the mass begins
as the angelic voices of the choir soar we see a pay phone etched with hyper real starkness against the white sand green sea and blue sky
a single leaning palm tree frames the image like a ridiculous tourist postcard
benvolio speaks on the pay phone
mercutio torso naked but for his holstered sports rapier mm drums his fingers on the side of the booth
where the devil should this romeo be
came he not home tonight
slamming down the phone not to his fathers
i spoke with his man
mercutio storms off down the beach
why that same pale hard hearted wench that rosaline torments him so that he will sure run mad
running to keep up tybalt hath sent a letter to his fathers house
halts abruptly a challenge on my life
close on benvolio unsure
romeo will answer it
any man that can write may answer a letter
nay he will answer the letters master how he dares being dared
mercutio clamps benvolio into a headlock
alas poor romeo he is already dead
stabbed with a white wenchs black eye he whispers into benvolios ear run through the ear with a love song
in disgust and is he a man to encounter tybalt
struggling to break free why what is tybalt
releasing him more than prince of cats i can tell you
o hes the courageous captain of compliments
the very butcher of a silk button
lightening fast mercutio draws his gun
he twirls it in an impressive display of gunmanship which ends with the barrel between the startled benvolios eyes
a duellist a duellist
romeos car pulls into the beach side parking lot
benvolio heads toward it
here comes romeo here comes romeo
romeo alights from his car and throws his keys to balthasar who lounges outside the beach side hang
mercutio saunters up the beach with mock nonchalance
signor romeo bonjour
theres a french salutation to your french slop
you gave us the counterfeit fairly last night
good morrow to you both
what counterfeit did i give you
the slip sir the slip
can you not conceive
romeo smiles smugly
pardon good mercutio
my business was great and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy
a most courteous exposition
nay i am the very pink of courtesy
pink for flower
the boys laugh
romeo feigns anger
i will bite thee on the ear for that jest
mercutio goading romeo to follow backs off down the beach
come between us good benvolio
my wits faint
mercutio flicks sand at romeo then sprints off down the beach
romeo laughing gives chase
switch and spurs switch and spurs or ill cry a match
romeo is gaining on mercutio who runs headlong into the sea
with a yell romeo dives in after him
mercutio splashes the laughing romeo
why is not this better now than groaning for love
romeo tries to dunk mercutio
now art thou sociable
mercutio evading heads for shore
now art thou romeo
now art thou
romeo tackles mercutio on the wet sand
mercutio falls suddenly serious
what thou art by art as well as by nature
a moment between the boys
a shadow falls across them
romeo looks up
heres goodly gear
standing above the boys is the nurse
she wears a ridiculous all red jackie o style disguise of sunglasses scarf and parasol
god ye good een fair gentlewoman
the nurse ignoring mercutio speaks dramatically to romeo
i desire some confidence with you
she turns and walks back to the parking lot where peter the chauffer waits beside the limousine
benvolio and the other boys look on curiously
a bawd a bawd a bawd
but romeo rises and to the amazement of mercutio actually follows this woman
mercutio looks questioningly to benvolio who shrugs
she will endite him to some supper
even more strangely romeo gets into the limousine
taken by surprise romeo will you come to your fathers
well to dinner thither
as he closes the door i will follow you
farewell ancient lady
the car pulls away
the limousine drives through verona beach
close on romeo jammed into the corner of the seat
the nurses face is pressed alarmingly close to his
she speaks in cold deadly earnest
if ye should lead her in a fools paradise as they say it were a very gross kind of behavior as they say
for the gentlewoman is young and therefore if you should deal double with her truly it were an ill thing and very weak dealing
beat romeo chooses his words carefully
bid her to come to confession this afternoon and there she shall at friar laurences cell be shrived and push in on romeo married
close on juliets face peering out her bedroom window
o god she comes
pull back juliets p
the limousine pulls up at the front door the nurse alights
juliet bolts from the room
juliet hurries down the stairs the nurse a way ahead disappears into a doorway
juliet races down a dark stairwell that leads to the bowels of the house
the kitchen obviously the nurses domain is decorated with a mixture of religious iconography and travel posters
most of the posters depict a strange city of decadent decaying beauty
juliet bursts breathlessly into the room
o honey nurse what news
the nurse buried up to her ample hips inside the refrigerator does not turn around
juliet cries impatiently
the nurse emerges from the ice box laden with food
moving to the counter she starts to make a sandwich
i am aweary give me leave awhile
fie how my bones ache
what a jaunce have i
juliet under her breath
i would thou hadst my bones and i thy news
juliet goes to the nurse
nay come i pray thee speak good nurse speak
sandwich made the nurse shuffles over to a corner couch
jesu what haste
can you not stay awhile
can you not see i am out of breath
juliet cannot stand the suspense any longer
how art thou out of breath when thou hast breath to say to me that thou art out of breath
is the news good or bad
answer to that
the nurse takes a big bite from her sandwich and answers through thoughtful chews
well you have made a simple choice
you know not how to choose a man
no not he
though his face be better than any mans yet his leg excels all mens and for a hand and a foot and a body though they be not to be
talked on yet they are past compare
hes not the flower of courtesy but ill warrant him as gentle as a lamb
go thy ways wench serve god
what have you dined at home
juliet is flabbergasted
but all this i did know before
what says he of our marriage
what of that lord how my head aches
what a head have i my back this is a game that juliet knows well
she moves behind the nurse and begins massaging her back
o tother side ah my back
beshrew your heart for sending me to catch my death with jauncing up and down
with sublime self control juliet coos sweetly
ifaith i am sorry that thou art not well
sweet sweet sweet nurse tell me what says my love
your love says like an honest gentleman and a courteous and a kind and a handsome and i warrant a virtuous where is your mother
where is my mother
how oddly thou repliest
your love says like an honest gentleman where is your mother
the nurse sulks
o gods lady dear are you so hot
henceforth do your messages yourself
juliets frustration explodes
heres such a coil
come what says pause the nurse considers juliet
have you got leave to go to confession today
then hie you hence to father laurence cell
there stays a husband to make you a wife
juliet with a scream of joy hugs the nurse to her
hold on juliets ecstatic features
these violent delights have violent ends
pull back father laurence is preaching energetically from the pulpit
hidden from the congregation romeo waits in a small alcove chapel at the side of the altar
the sweetest honey is loathsome in its own deliciousness therefore love moderately
the father glances toward romeo
long love doth so
too swift arrives as tardy as too slow
juliet pushes through the double doors at the far end of the church
father laurence motions to the middle aged choir master who leads the choir into a choral version of led zeppelins a whole lot of love with latin lyrics
father laurence hurries from the altar over to romeo
here comes the lady
juliet bursts into the tiny chapel
trying to observe a vestige of decorum she greets father laurence
good afternoon to my ghostly confessor
but before the priest can reply the two lovers embrace kissing passionately
romeo shall thank thee daughter for us both
the choir completes the hymn and the priest realising it is his cue rushes back to the altar
he quickly delivers a prayer to the congregation while eyeing the increasingly amorous smooching of the young couple
the choir launch into a joyous chorus and the priest returns to romeo and juliet
he delicately parts the couple
come come and we will make short work
for by your leaves you shall not stay alone till holy church incorporate two in one
a young boy with a voice like jamiroquai steps forward
he launches into a wailing solo
macro close up a simple silver ring
engraved on the inside of the band are the words i love thee
pull back romeo slips the ring onto juliets finger as the priest executes the formal sacrament of marriage
crane up through the majestic patterning of stained glass and out of the church to find peter the chauffeur cradling a small camera as he waits nervously beside the limo
the music swells in celebration
romeo and juliet now newly wed rush from the side door of the church
the priest follows throwing handfuls of rice
peter studiously takes a snap as the bride and groom kiss
peter holds the door of the limousine open
reluctantly juliet gets into the car
as the car pulls out of the driveway romeo runs alongside
hold on romeo as he watches the big black car speed away
fish eye view from the bottom of the ocean mercutios distorted features
gun aimed he stares intently into the water
a muffled bang
and a bullet whizzes past the camera
we see that mercutio wading in knee deep water close to the beach is hunting fish
benvolio shelters in the shade of an unmanned life guard tower
a shimmering heat haze blankets the deserted beach and the horizon is stacked with purple storm clouds
i pray thee good mercutio lets retire
the day is hot mercutio ignoring him plugs away at another fish
benvolio nervously looks to see if there is any reaction to the sound of the shot
the capels are abroad
and if we meet we shall not scape a brawl
mercutio strides out of the water
thou art like one of these fellows that when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says god send me no need
he hands benvolio his gun and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer when indeed there is no need
another incredible sleight of hand routine and mercutio has managed to draw benvolios pistol retrieve his own gun and trap benvolio with a barrel at each temple
the joke has worn thin for benvolio he pushes past mercutio toward where balthasar sampson and gregory lounge in the shade of the beach side hang
suddenly he stops dead a monstrous black sedan prowls into the beach side parking lot
by my head here comes the capulets
by my heel i care not
the sedan mounts the curb and slides to a halt only metres from benvolio and mercutio
tybalt abra and petruchio alight from the sedan and walk menacingly toward mercutio and benvolio
gentlemen good day
a word with one of you
the boys from the hang drawn the capulet car converge eyes dart nervously hands stray towards guns
mercutio smiles mockingly
and but one word with one of us
couple it with something
make it a word and a
leaning close to tybalt he camps the implication
the boys laugh
you shall find me apt enough to that sir clutching at his side arm and you will give me occasion
close on mercutio
he stops eyeing the hand on the gun
no one moves
a breathy coquettish could you not take some occasion without giving
the boys fall about again
mercutio thou consortest with romeo
the accusation stings mercutios anger flares
what dost thou make us minstrels
and thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing but discords
heres my fiddlestick
indicating his holstered gun
heres that shall make you dance
barking at tybalt zounds goading him to go for his gun consort
close on tybalt
close on mercutio
he will not back down
benvolio tries to diffuse things
either withdraw unto some private place
or reason coldly of your grievances
here all eyes gaze on us
mens eyes were made to look and let them gaze
i will not budge for no mans pleasure i
at that moment romeos car pulls into the lot
well sir here comes my man
tybalt moves toward romeo who bounds from his car full of happy news
romeo the love i bear thee can no better term than this close on tybalt
he clears his jacket from his side arm and issues the challenge
thou art a villain
close on mercutio
close on benvolio
all eyes are on romeo
romeo calmly approaches his now cousin
tybalt the reason that i have to love thee doth much excuse the appertaining to such a greeting villain am i none therefore farewell
i see thou knowest me not
romeo turns and to the amazement of all walks back to his car
tybalt unable to shoot him in the back is confused
he hurls himself into his sedan
kicking it into a sand spraying u turn he careens the short distance to romeos car
slamming into the back of it he blocks romeo in
tybalt leaps out maniacally kicking at bumper door and headlights
romeo flicks the locks down
tybalt shatters the side window and hauls romeo through the door slamming him against the savaged fuselage
boy this shall not excuse the that thou hast done me
he smashes romeo across the face romeo crashes to the roadway
turn and draw
a cut has opened in the side of romeos mouth
he unsteadily lifts himself up and meeting tybalts gaze speaks through bloodied teeth
i never injured thee and so good capulet which name i as dearly as mine own
romeo cautiously extracts his gun
and throws it at tybalts feet
storm clouds obscure the sun as romeo turns and walks from the parking lot
mercutio benvolio and the others cannot believe their eyes
o calm dishonourable vile submission
tybalts anger must be answered
he ceremoniously disarms gives his weapon to abra and sprints after romeo who is now passing a beach side lot that houses an abandoned grand hotel
a bone cracking kick sends romeo crumbling into the vacant lot
the boys swarm toward the fray
romeo still refusing the fight scrambles up the stairs of the deserted hotel
tybalt trips him and romeo careens into an ornamental wooden railing smashing it to pieces
tybalt kicks savagely at the helpless romeo
suddenly mercutio appears running full tilt down the concrete terrace
he plucks up one of the splintered wooden palings and yells
tybalt you ratcatcher as he bludgeons him across the face
tybalt goes down
will you walk
tybalt leaps to his feet grabbing a lump of wood
what wouldst thou have with me
he swipes at mercutio
good king of cats nothing but one of your nine lives
mercutio jabs tybalt sidesteps
i am for you
tybalt aims a double handed blow to mercutios head
mercutio blocks hooking tybalts stick away
unarmed tybalt throws his full body weight upon mercutio slamming him against a window that shatters in a storm of glass
lightning fast mercutio jackknifes to his feet
he raises his weapon to deliver a skull crushing final blow to the trapped tybalt
romeo rushes between them
forbear this outrage good mercutio
seizing the opportunity tybalt lunges at romeo with a lethal triangle of broken glass
he misses gouging instead a slash of flesh from mercutios stomach
a scream of excruciating pain as mercutio grabs at his bloodied side
everyone is still
in the abrupt silence sirens are heard closing in the distance
abra tugs at tybalt
they bolt for their vehicle
benvolio goes to mercutio
art thou hurt
but mercutio covering his wound with his hand laughs
ay ay a scratch
he turns to his assembled fans at the bottom of the stairs
with outrageous bravado he plays at being caesar the conqueror
the boys cheer their conquering hero
romeo helps mercutio down the stairs
the hurt cannot be much
mercutio holding his bleeding side jokes through the pain
ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man
he turns the next thought to the assembled audience
through crazy laughter a plague o both your houses
mercutio turns from the cheering boys to romeo who is struggling to support his weight
mercutio through weak and desperate breathing
why the devil came you between us
i was hurt under your arm
romeo starts to register the panic in mercutios eyes
i thought all for the best
like an animal trying to break free from a mortal trap mercutio pushes romeo away
he screams in horror as if falling in the dark a plague o both your houses
they have made worms meat of me
mercutio staggers down the stairs and collapses in the dirt
romeo is there instantly cradling his friends head out of the dust
the dying boy stares back at romeo smiling through the chilling cold
a silent whisper your houses
everything stands still everything is quiet
the storm finally breaks
tiny drops of water fall from the sky and bespeckle mercutios lifeless body
the droplets grow to a heavy rain
romeo can hear the faint sound a thousand miles away of benvolio whispering mercutio is dead
tears streak romeos face
he cries out
oh sweet juliet thy beauty hath made me effeminate and in my temper softened valors steel
the sound of tybalts vehicle starting brings back cold reality
romeos sorrow turns to uncontrollable rage
shrugging aside benvolios attempts to restrain him romeo runs to his car
up ahead tybalts sedan screeches into a fishtailing u turn and powers away
romeo jumps into his vehicle
in an effort to head tybalt off he guns his damaged machine down a one way street
the rain is now blinding
romeo stops for nothing pedestrians flee cars spin out of control
aerial shot the two cars speed along parallel roads toward plaza jesu
romeo is gaining
cut to tybalts car negotiating the immense roundabout at the foot of the statue of jesus
cut to romeos car firing out of the one way street and slamming into tybalts car
tybalts car careens out of control up the stairs of the statue clips the fountain flips and slides upside down onto the roadway
cut to tybalt scrambling from his upturned vehicle
cut to romeo running toward him
suddenly romeo is halted by tybalts drawn gun
fearlessly marching toward it he screams through tears
mercutios soul is but a little way above our heads romeo grabs the barrel of the gun forcing it between his own eyes he growls insanely at tybalt
staying for thine to keep him company
tybalt unnerved tries to back off
thou wretched boy shalt with him hence
romeo refusing to let go of the gun forces tybalt backward through the torrential rain
with frightening intensity either thou or i or both must go with him
cars swerve romeo is relentless
he grips tybalts hand trying to force him to shoot
either thou or i or both must go with him
panicked tybalt wrenches free and lurches onto the roadway
blinded by the headlights of an oncoming car he thuds onto its hood as it skids to a halt
the impact catapults his gun high into the air
romeo coldly follows its slow motion spinning trajectory
real time stretches as the gun dances high above his head
police sirens cars swerving people screaming and the yelling of panicked commands fade to a nothingness
romeo stands calmly considering the gun in the air
a harrowing symphonic tone and the echo of mercutios voice can be heard
why the devil came you between us
cut to patrol cars sliding to a halt
cut to the spinning gun slowly falling to earth
cut to tybalt rising from the ground
cut to cops leaping from their cars
cut to the gun landing in romeos hand
his eyes full of rage
cut to cops levelling their revolvers
romeo in his sights put up thy weapon
cut to real time romeo fires three deliberate shots
tybalts body convulses backwards against the car hitting it with a thud bloodying the shattered windscreen
the cop fires
a bullet grazes romeos arm his gun drops as he screams
o i am fortunes fool
at that moment a roaring hurricane wind hits blinding police
close on the scaffolding surrounding the jesus statue
part of its canvas covering rips away
scaffold rains down as the insanely flapping material tries to smash free from its moorings
through the mayhem a rusty ford driven by balthasar slides to a halt
balthasar screams out at romeo
romeo away be gone
stand not amazed
romeo collapses into the front seat
the cops open fire as balthasar speeds off into the storm
romeo is bleeding from the bullet graze
the gale force winds throw waves across the causeway as the fugitives disappear into the black afternoon
crane up in the distance we see montague and capulet towers
divided by the statue of christ they suffer the storms rage
away below the outstretched arms of christ lights from emergency vehicles pulse red through the downpour
the camera falls through heavy rain toward a woman crouched over the lifeless body of tybalt
she cries tybalt
cops nervously eye fulgencio capulet and ted montague who both flanked by body guards face each other across the crime scene
medics stand by helplessly as gloria clings to tybalts body
a handcuffed benvolio looks on
tybalt my cousin o my brothers child
o the blood is spilled of my dear kinsman
police lines part as captain prince arrives
where are the vile beginners of this fray
benvolio struggles forward
o noble prince i can discover all the unlucky manage of this fatal brawl
gloria appeals hysterically prince as thou art true for blood of ours shed blood of montague
benvolio who began this bloody fray
pointing to tybalts corpse there lies the man slain by young romeo that slew thy kinsman brave mercutio
gloria interjects savagely
he speaks not true
affection makes him false
romeo that spoke him fair could not take truce with the unruly spleen of deaf to peace
he is a kinsman to the montague
i beg for justice which thou prince must give
romeo slew tybalt romeo must not live
captain prince turns to gloria
romeo slew him he slew mercutio
who now the price of his dear blood doth owe
ted montague pleads not romeo prince he was mercutios friend his fault concludes but what the law should end the life of tybalt
captain prince eyes montague coldly
and for that offence immediately we do exile him
montague body guards in tow surges forward
prince silences him
i will be deaf to pleading and nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses
therefore use none
the captain turns and addresses his assembled officers
let romeo hence in haste else when he is found that hour is his last
close on captain prince
bear hence this body and attend our will
mercy but murders pardoning those that kill
an acoustic guitar version of joy divisions love will tear us apart
juliet traces the path of a raindrop on the window pane as she speaks her thoughts to the storm
come gentle night coming loving black browed night give me my romeo
and when i shall die take him and cut him out in little stars and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be
in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun
o i have bought the mansion of a but not possessed it and though i am sold not yet enjoyed
so tedious is this day as is the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new and may not wear them
the limousine pulls into the driveway
pull out of the window and crane down juliet runs from the room
through the open doorway we see an excited juliet meet the nurse at the bottom of the stairs
the music surges
track in the nurses words are lost in the storm
we are close enough now to hear juliets words
did romeos hand shed tybalts blood
it did it did
alas the day it did
oh serpent heart hid with a flowering face
was ever book containing such vile so fairly bound
o that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace
theres no trust no faith no honesty in men
all perjured all forsworn all naught all dissemblers
shame come to romeo
blistered be thy tongue for such a wish
he was not born to shame
upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit
will you speak well of him that killed your cousin
shall i speak ill of him that is my husband
ah poor my lord what tongue shall smooth thy name when i thy three hours wife have mangled it
but whyfore villain didst thou kill my cousin
that villain cousin would have killed my husband
all this is comfort wherefore weep i then
some word there was worser than tybalts death i would forget it fain exiled
tybalt is dead and romeo exiled
to speak that word is father mother tybalt romeo juliet all slain all dead
juliet sinks to the floor overwhelmed by tears
nurse ill to my wedding bed and death not romeo take my maidenhead
nurse looks down at juliet
she goes and comforts her
hie to your chamber
ill find to comfort you
i know well where he is
hark ye your romeo will be here at night
juliet looks up through tears
o find him give this ring to my true knight and bid him come to take his last farewell
slam macro zoom into the ring
the screen fills with the words i love thee
romeo lies on the bed shirtless and crying
his wound has been bandaged and balthasar crouches frightened in the corner
the priest leads the nurse into the room
romeo looks up
she goes to him
deaths the end of all
speakest thou of juliet
where is she
and how doth she
and what says my concealed lady to our cancelled love
o she says nothing sir but weeps and weeps and then on romeo cries and then falls down again
romeo is wailing inconsolably
as if that name shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her as that names cursed hand murdered her kinsman
father laurence shakes the hysterical boy
i thought thy disposition better tempered
thy juliet is alive there art thou happy
the law that threatened death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile
there art thou happy
a pack of blessings light upon thy back
the nurse gives him the ring
here sir a ring my lady bid me give you
romeo enfolds the ring in his hand
how well my comfort is revived by this
the priest goes to his wardrobe removes a clean white shirt and helps romeo put it on
go get thee to thy love as was decreed
ascend her chamber
hence and comfort her
but look thou stay not till the watch be set for then thou canst not pass to mantua where thou shalt live till we can find a time to blaze
your marriage reconcile your friends beg pardon of the prince and call thee back with twenty hundred thousand times more joy than thou wentst forth in lamentation
father laurence ushers romeo from the room
they hurry down the hallway
the priest opens the front door
be gone by the break of sojourn in mantua
give me thy hand
romeo embraces him
the priest and balthasar watch as romeo and the nurse sprint for the car
sobs echo through the house
dave paris stands in the entrance hallway clutching a huge bunch of flowers
fulgencio capulet stands beside him whisky glass in hand
cut to gloria on the upper landing
there is a strange faraway quality about her as she descends to dave and capulet
shell not come down tonight
dave an understanding smile
these times of woe afford no times to woo
capulet guides dave into the house
look you she loved her kinsman tybalt dearly
and so did i
a cold glance at gloria well we were born to die
capulet takes a large slug of whisky
gloria leans close to dave
ill know her mind early tomorrow
tonight shes mewed up to her heaviness
as gloria dave and capulet exit down the hallway we crane up toward juliets bedroom door
close on juliets face
tears stream onto the pillow
without warning a hand lightly touches her cheek
juliets eyes dart up to discover romeo standing above her
a still moment of disbelief
leaning down roemo kisses away the tears that fall from her dark wide eyes
juliets lips find romeos and they gently sink back onto the bed
capulet sits in an armchair drinking
dave and gloria sit opposite as capulet whips himself into a frenzy of drunken excitement
well keep no great ado a friend or two
for hark you tybalt being slain so late it may be thought we held him carelessly being our kinsman if we revel much but soft what day is this
monday my lord
well wednesday is too soon what say you to thursday
gloria looks up alarmed dave is stunned
my lord i
leaning close i will make a desperate tender of my childs love
a drunken good humour i think she will be ruled in all respects by me exploding with hearty laughter nay more i doubt it not
cut to gloria her face hardens
to dave but what say you to thursday
dave is trying to catch up
my lord i
cut to capulet he eyes dave intently
i would that thursday were tomorrow
delighted capulet jumps to his feet
a thursday let it be then
capulet holds out his glass in toast
dave and gloria rise
wife go you to juliet ere you go to bed
tell her a thursday she shall be to this noble sir
close on the glasses clink
a pink and gold dawn breaks over capulet mansion
a tangle of young limbs
romeo and juliet blissfully asleep
the dawn light creeps into the room
balthasars car covertly pulls into a side road near the estate
romeo and juliet still asleep
crane down toward the sleeping innocence of the faces
hold a shadow of fear passes across romeos features
with a cry of panic he sits bolt upright
wide awake but disorientated romeo stares around the room as juliet stirs he remembers where he is
slipping quietly from the bed romeo begins to dress
close on romeo
a pair of lips enter frame and find his neck
it is juliet
she hugs herself to him
wilt thou be gone
it is not yet near day
romeo turns softly he strokes her cheek
i must be gone and live or stay and die
juliet kisses his finger tips
yond light is not daylight and then his cheek
i know it i it is some meteor that the sun to light thee on thy way to mantua
therefore stay yet
thou needest not to be gone
romeo feverishly returning the kisses throws himself on juliet
let me be taken let me be put to death
i have more care to stay than will to go
come death and welcome
juliet wills it so
juliet is suddenly still
romeo kisses her gently
how ist my soul
it is not day
juliet pulls romeo to his feet
it is it is
hie hence be gone away
o now be gone
more light and light it grows
frantically she helps him into his clothes
more light and light more dark and dark our woes
there is an urgent knocking on the door
your lady mother is coming to your chamber
then window let day in and let life out
desperately juliet pulls romeo out onto the balcony
the storm now past has left a morning achingly pure
one kiss and ill descend
romeo climbs down from the balcony and into the shadows
o thinkst thou we shall ever meet again
romeo smiles up at her
i doubt it not juliets face darkens
o god i have an ill divining soul
methinks i see thee now thou art so low as one dead in the bottom of a tomb
romeo scrambles back up to the balcony
trust me love all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come
from juliets bedroom comes the brittle sound of gloria capulets voice
are you up
juliet spins around
gloria has parted the curtains and is staring directly at her daughter
cut to romeo sheltered just below the lip of the balcony
follow his hand as it slowly reaches up and touches juliets fingers hidden behind her back
gloria returns to the room
juliet steals a glance toward romeo as he silently mouths adieu adieu
as romeos face disappears into the shadows juliet whispers a little prayer to herself
o fortune fortune
be fickle fortune fo then i hope thou wilt not keep him long but send him back
juliet is trying not to cry as she goes in to her mother
gloria turns to her
thou hast a careful father child one who to put thee from thy heaviness hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects not nor i looked not
juliet plays along
madam in happy time
what day is that
gloria takes a deep breath
marry my child early next thursday the gallant young and noble gentleman sir paris at saint peters church shall happily make thee there a joyful bride
close on juliet
she can barely speak
now by saint peters church and peter too he shall not make me there a joyful bride
fear passes across glorias face
here comes your father
tell him so yourself
capulet whisky glass in hand ebulliently bursts into the room
how now wife
have you delivered to her our decree
but she will none she gives you thanks
i would the fool were married to her grave
capulet a dangerous calm
will she none
is she not proud
doth she not count her blest unworthy as she is that we have so worthy a gentleman to be her bride
not proud you have but thankful that you have
proud can i never be of what i hate
pause capulet considers his daughter then bam
he hurls his glass against the wall shattering it into a thousand pieces
thank me no thankings nor proud me no prouds but fettle your fine joints gainst thursday next
juliet terrified retreats into the hallway
hear me with patience but to speak a word
the nurse appears as capulet picks his daughter up and shakes her like a rag doll
speak not reply not do not answer me
he throws her to the floor
his fist thuds as it slams into her face
what are you mad
gloria tries to restrain capulet
he back hands her sending her flying against the wall bellowing insanely he advances on his cowering daughter
hang thee young baggage
the nurse throws herself between capulet and juliet
god in heaven bless her
you are to blame my lord to rate her so
furious capulet shunts her aside
peace you mumbling fool
capulet yanks his daughters face close to his
i tell thee what get thee to church a thursday or never after look me in the face
and you be mine ill give you to my friend
and you be not hang beg starve die in the streets trust to it
ill not be forsworn
capulet storms off down the hall
close on juliet
she huddles shaking at the top of the stairs
o sweet my mother cast me not away
delay this marriage for a month a week
or if you do not make the bridal in that dim monument where tybalt lies
a trickle of blood issues from glorias cut lip
she checks her appearance in the hall mirror
talk not to me for ill not speak a word
do as thou wilt for i have done with thee
o nurse how shall this be prevented
the nurse doesnt reply
what sayest thou
hast thou not a word of joy
some comfort nurse
a heavy silence
the nurse goes to juliet
faith here it is
i think it best you married with this paris
o hes a lovely gentleman
i think you are happy in this second match for it excels your first or if it did not your first is dead or twere as good he were as
living here and you no use of him
juliet is very still
speakest thou from thy heart
and from my soul too
else beshrew them both
juliet is matter of fact
well thou hast comforted me marvellous much
go in and tell my lady i am gone having displeased my father to friar laurence to make confession and to be absolved
the old woman nods
she strokes juliets hair
this is wisely done
juliet does not look up
a disturbing choral chant sunlight pierces stained glass the chant a sinister underscoring
we hear dave paris voice immoderately she weeps for tybalts death
crane down father laurence and dave paris stand at the front of the church
now sir her father counts it that she doth give her sorrow so much sway and in his wisdom hastes our to stop the inundation of her tears
father laurence turns
juliet stands framed in the white glare of the doorway
happily met my lady and my wife
close on juliets hand concealed beneath her coat we can just see the handle of a gun
juliet advances slowly an icy calm that may be sir when i may be a wife
that may be must be love on thursday next
juliet stares past dave
what must be shall be
father laurence a forced cheerfulness
thats a certain text
come you to make confession
juliet forces a smile
are you at leisure holy father now
or shall i come to you at evening mass
my leisure serves me pensive daughter now
to dave we must entreat the time alone
god shield i should disturb devotion
juliet on thursday early will i rouse ye dave bends
close on juliet she stares stonily ahead as dave kisses her cheek
till then adieu and keep this holy kiss
track with juliet she runs for the sacristy
the priest follows
juliet shaking with sobs takes refuge in the shadows of the small room
the priest goes to her
o juliet i already know thy grief
juliet pulls away
tell me not father that thou hearest of this unless thou tell me how i may prevent it
it strains me past the compass of my wits
if in thy wisdom thou canst give no do thou but call my resolution wise and with this ill help it presently
she pulls the gun pointing it towards herself
horrified father laurence moves to her
juliet panicked levels the gun at him
through tears be not so long to speak
i lone to die
father laurence holds out a soothing hand
i do spy a kind of hope which craves as desperate an as that is desperate which we would prevent
if rather than marry paris thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself then it is likely thou wilt a thing like death
we hear the distended chords of faures requiem
to chide away this shame
it continues throughout as the entire screen fills with a glinting tear drop of blue liquid
reflected in the fluids convex surface the face of father laurence
the face disappears as the tear drop falls and splashes into a clear water solution
like a comet in slow motion the drop stains the water a cobalt hue
pull back the blue liquid fills a tiny glass vial held by father laurence
no warmth no breath shall testify thou livest
each part deprived of supple government shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death
now when the bridegroom in the comes to rouse thee from thy bed there art thou dead
thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all the kindred of the capulets lie
in the meantime against thou shalt awake shall romeo by my letters know our drift and hither shall he come
and that very night shall romeo bear thee hence to mantua
the priest cautiously hands juliet the vial
take thou this vial being then in bed and this distilling liquor drink thou off
ill send my letters to thy lord with speed to mantua
as father laurence speaks the screen fills with an express envelope addressed romeo mantua
the envelope pulls away from the camera and falls into a canvas bag brimming with hundreds of like envelopes
track with the canvas bag
it continues its journey into the back of an express delivery van
heavy double doors slam shut filling the screen with the slogan speed express
the van pulls away
a burning red sun is setting over an endless vista of ragged wasteland
crane down a weathered sign reads mantua behind it a vast colony of permanent trailer homes stretches into the distance
the rap rap rap of knocking echoes through the park
cut to the source of the knocking
an express delivery man envelope in hand raps vigorously on the door of an unremarkable trailer
topographical shot romeo lies flat on a single bed in the crampled trailer
the rap rap rap is very loud now
we move toward romeo and realise he cannot hear the knocking because he has walkman headphones on
unsuccessful the delivery man is filling out a we called card
he pushes it under the door
the heraldic wedding chimes by js bach
juliet stands resplendent in a radiant bridal gown
the image floats ethereally in a towering slab of mirror
pull out from the mirror
the wedding dress is in fact being held in front of juliet by two members of the house staff
juliet is dressed in her night gown
the nurse suggests various pairs of shoes
ay these attires are best
the fuss dispensed with the staff leave
but gentle nurse i pray thee leave me to myself tonight
juliet navigates the nurse toward the door
almost in tears to move the heavens to smile upon my state which well thou knowest is cross and full of sin
juliet holds the nurse in a pleading stare
alone now juliet hurries to her bedside drawer
she cautiously removes a rolled piece of cloth from which she produces the glass vial
what if this mixture do not work at all
shall i be married then tomorrow morning
she cautiously begins to unscrew the tiny black lid
suddenly a knock at her door
palming the vial juliet swings around to meet the arrival of her mother
gloria probes her daughters uneasiness
what are you busy ho
need you my help
makes light of it no madam
we have culled such as are behoveful for our state tomorrow
so please you let me now be left alone and let the nurse this night sit up with you
juliet begins to pull down the covers on her bed
for i am sure you have your hands full all in this so sudden business
gloria sensing juliets distress moves cautiously toward her
taking hold of the bed covers she helps her daughter into bed
juliet slides into bed
gloria covers her with the blanket
get thee to bed and rest for thou hast need
a brief moment between mother and daughter
gloria unable to cross that final barrier moves to the door but she is stopped by the urgency in juliets voice
gloria turns to juliet
god knows when we shall meet again
close on gloria
a faint perplexity and then with an almost warm smile she turns out the light and leaves
the room is in darkness but for patterns of moonlight through windows
track toward juliet
the sombre tones of faures requiem seep into our consciousness
i have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins that almost freezes up the heat of life
she brings the vial her mouth
romeo i drink to thee
juliet drinks a sudden violent convulsion her face contorts in fear
the sky is filled with green and grey clouds
a gusty rain blows the flower arrangements across the lawn
large white wedding marquees flap in the wind
through blurring rain we see ambulances and police vehicles lights flashing
father laurence accompanied by a dour looking man in black alights from his car
we follow their p
we hear snatches of radio calls
of lethal quantity as twould render death
they enter the house and pass the vast dining room bedecked with wedding decorations
capulet sits at the large mahogany table
in the background gloria stares vacantly
moving swiftly toward a doorway the music builds
the door opens
on the bed juliets still body
father laurence closes the door
the priest kneels and hastily examines juliets pupils
he looks to the man in black who retrieves the glass vial from the floor and pockets it
to the man in black as the custom is in all her best array bear her to church
when the man in black allows two other dark suited men into the room it becomes clear he is the undertaker
she shall be borne to that same ancient vault where all the kindred of the capulets lie
a thousand voices proclaim the song of ascension
pan down from the vaulting glass ceiling of the capulet mausoleum
on view enshrined in literally thousands of lit candles is juliets peaceful body
we move through lines of capulet mourners
in the shadows of the front door a young man hides
close on the young man
we recognise the distressed face of balthasar
push in balthasar rushes from the mausoleum
we are high above mantua
beyond the trailer park stretches a long ribbon of black highway
as a speed express van turns off the highway and into the park we hear romeos voice over if i may trust the flattering truth of sleep my dreams presage
some joyful news at hand
crane down the express van pulls up at the front office
the driver alights and goes inside
romeo sits at the trailers small kitchen table smoking and writing in his notebook
the we called card lies next to an overflowing ashtray
his voice over continues
and all this day an unaccustomed lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts
i dreamt my lady came and found me and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that i revived and was an emperor
ah me how sweet is love itself when but loves shadows are so rich in joy
stubbing out his cigarette romeo gazes through the trailer window to see balthasars speeding car turn off the highway and into the trailer park
news from verona
an excited romeo rushes from the trailer
crane high romeo sprints across open ground to intercept balthasars car
we see but romeo cannot the express van approaching from the office
the car slews to a halt and balthasar jumps out
romeo yells joyously
how now balthasar
bathlasar cannot speak
dost thou not bring me letters from the priest
how doth my lady
is my father well
how doth my lady juliet
that i ask again for nothing can be ill if she be well
balthasar does not know how to say what he has come to tell
he looks away
then she is well and nothing can be ill
her body sleeps in capels monument and her immortal part with angels lives
i saw her laid low in her kindreds vault
for a long moment romeo is profoundly still
when he speaks it is with a chilling calm
is it een so
romeo turns and stares into the distant wasteland
close on he speaks with bitter determination
then i defy you stars
romeo moves to the car
i will hence tonight
balthasar tries to restrain him
exploding with fury romeo throws balthasar against the vehicle
cut to the speed express messenger
returning to his truck the priests undelivered envelope in his hand the messenger looks toward the two boys
cut to the boys
balthasar pleads with romeo
your looks are pale and wild and do some misadventure
with cold serenity tush thou art deceived
a niggling thought hast thou no letters to me from the priest
balthasar shakes his head
no matter i will hence tonight
romeo climbs into the passenger seat of the car
balthasar reluctantly gets behind the wheel
as silent tears begin to flow romeo turns his face to the setting sun
push in as he whispers well juliet i will lie with thee tonight
balthasars car roars out of the park
cut to the delivery man
he looks to the envelope in his hand then gets back into his truck
balthasars car speeds along the night time highway
crane up in the distance the glow of city lights
balthasars car pulls into an alley and stops outside a decrepity apartment block
close on a bespectacled eye peers through the crack of a partly open doorway
below the face the barrel of a shotgun protrudes menacingly
cut to romeo in the dark paint peeling hallway
let me have a dram of poison such soon speeding gear as will disperse itself through all the veins that the life weary taker may fall dead
the eye considers a voice rasps back
such mortal drugs i have but veronas law is death to any he that utters them
romeo speaks with fury
the world is not thy friend nor the worlds law
then be not poor but break it and take this
romeo shoves a wad of money at the apothecarys face
the rattle of a latch chain and the door swings open
standing in the doorway is the apothecary
sixty something he has a face scarred with age and abuse
my poverty but not my will consents
close on romeo
i pay thy poverty and not thy will
close on father laurence
he speaks into the telephone with concern
who bore my letter then to romeo
a bored clerk is on the other end of the line
the priests letter is on the counter beside him
i could not sent it here it is again
father laurence is worried
by my brotherhood unhappy fortune
the letter was of dear import
pause the priest listens adieu
he hangs up the receiver and looks at the wall clock
now must i to the monument alone
within this hour will fair juliet awake
dissolve from the clock to
close on a cat skitters across a stained formica table
pull back the apothecarys apartment is filled with cats
dozens of feline eyes glow in the dim room
romeo stands nervously
the apothecary extracts a small chemists vial from inside a statue of our lady table lamp he now speaks with cool professionalism
drink it off and if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight
romeo takes the vial and hands over the money
there is my gold worse poison to mens souls than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell
motor running balthasar waits in the alley outside the apartment building
he checks the rear view mirror and freezes
at the end of the alleyway a police car crawls to a halt
romeo exits the building and as he does so the streetlight catches his face
the cops and romeos eyes meet
close on the cop
this is that banished haughty montague
balthasar cracks he guns the engine and the car lurches forward
tires screech as romeo dives into the passenger seat of balthasars moving vehicle
siren blaring the police car gives chase
balthasars car winds through traffic the patrol car gaining
a police car u turns over a median strip
tight on a rusted brown hood
the tortured engine screams as balthasar negotiates the speeding car through city traffic
crane up red and blue police light approach fast
captain prince barrels through the corridors of police headquarters pulling on his flying jacket
tight on a smoking tire as it lays rubber to the asphalt
balthasar grits his teeth as he weaves the car through the impossibly tight space between a container truck and a bus
whip pan the patrol car is almost upon them when
in a seemingly suicidal manoeuvre balthasar throws his car into a right angle turn across four lanes of oncoming traffic
cut to a skidding squealing out of control sedan braking to avoid collision
miraculously balthasars vehicle shoots out of it its path and onto the other side of the roadway
the sedan slams into the following patrol car
balthasars car speeds into the driveway of the verona beach eternal rest cemetery
captain prince scans the night time city below
he speaks to the pilot and the chopper banks sharply
close on a stone angel etched against the night sky
pan down romeo pulls a crowbar from the trunk of the parked car
police sirens sound in the distance
romeo eyes balthasar intently
upon thy life whatever thou or seest stand all aloof
give me the light balthasar stands motionless romeo rips the torch from his hands and strides into the cemetery
i do beseech you
romeo turns punching balthasar hard he goes down blood spurting from his nose
do not interrupt me in my course or by heaven i will tear thee joint by and strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs
balthasar slowly rises
both boys are trying hard not to cry
the time and my intents are savage wild more fierce and more inexorable far than empty tigers or the roaring sea
i will be gone and not trouble ye
so shalt thou show me friendship
they embrace as romeo whispers
live and be prosperous and farewell good fellow
close on a crowbar wrenches at ornate glass and iron doors
pull back the gothic structure of the mausoleum rears against the night sky
romeo frenziedly attacks the gates of the small side chapel
thou detestable maw thou womb of death thus i enforce thy rotten jaws to open
with a final heave the doors scrape open
an endless marble corridor lit by hundreds of tiny flickering eternal flames
close on romeo
he murmurs in despite ill cram thee with more food
suddenly a hurricane wind and whirr of machinery like a huge black insect captain princes chopper swoops down over the mausoleum
romeo is caught in the glare of the choppers burning arc light
sirens scream police units race through the cemetery
blinded romeo fires wildly toward the chopper
the police cars screech to a halt
close on a police marksman in the chopper
his finger squeezes the rifle trigger
a bullet slams into romeos shoulder
the other cops open fire and romeo is sent reeling backwards into the mausoleum in a fusillade of bullets
an angry captain prince bellows into the radio
the police hold their fire
bleeding from the shoulder wound romeo drags shut the heavy double doors of the chapel
he bangs off three shots through a pane of broken glass and screams at the police
stand all aloof
outside the chopper hovers
police take up siege positions
captain princes voice echoes through the bullhorn
romeo come forth come forth
romeo uses the crowbar to wedge the doors shut
he bangs off another shot as he yells out at the police
tempt not a desperate man
there is no response from the cops
as the chopper settles to earth captain prince speaks into the radio
bring forth these enemies montague and capulet
orange rescue lights reflect through the windshield of the priests car as it crawls past the crashed sedan and police vehicle
father laurence thumps the steering wheel in frustration
saint francis be my speed tonight
across the road police swarm around the entrance to the cemetery
fear comes upon me
o much i fear some ill unthrifty thing
hold on the green glow of the car clock as the seconds pulse away
track down the marble corridor lit by the eternal flames
he weakly stands at the entrance to the viewing chapel
the chapel is dark
as romeos eyes adjust he can just see picked out by a shaft of blue moonlight the glowing figure of a sleeping girl
he moves down the aisle past the tombs of long dead capulets
romeo is close now
he halts as if in the presence of an unbelievable vision
he lights a match and the room glows gold
the warm light reveals a juliet even more beautiful in seeming death
romeo lights some of the hundreds of candles that surround her
o my love my wife death that hath sucked the honey of thy breath hath had no power yet upon thy beauty thou art not conquered
beautys ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks and deaths pale flag is not advanced there
romeo kneels close as if not wanting to wake a sleeping child
unconscious tears fall from his eyes as he whispers
ah dear juliet why art thou yet so fair
shall i believe that unsubstantial is amorous and keeps thee here in to be his paramour
for fear of i still will stay with thee
here oh here will i set up my everlasting rest and shake the yoke of inauspicious from this world wearied flesh
he lays himself close
eyes look your last
arms take your last embrace
and lips o you the doors of breath seal with a righteous kiss
gently romeo kisses juliets lips
ever so slightly juliets hand moves romeo does not notice
a dateless bargain to engrossing death
romeo drinks from the vial the power of the compound is immediate
he convulses and falls his head resting on juliet
fighting for breath o true apothecary thy drugs are quick
behind romeos head we can see juliets eyes opening
romeo sucks the last few breaths of life into his lungs
through a blurry consciousness juliet becomes aware of romeo
oh romeo whats here
forcing herself up she cradles his head in her arms
romeos clear wide eyes stare back he is completely still but for the sound of weak breaths desperately drawn across motionless lips
juliet finds the vial clenched in romeos hand
tears slip from her eyes
drunk all and left no friendly drop to help me after
i will kiss thy lips
haply some poison yet doth hang on to make me die with a restorative
she delicately kisses romeos lips
a heart broken whisper thy lips are warm
desperately the lovers cling to each other
with all his desire to stay alive romeo whispers thus with a kiss i die
there is no breath
he is still
sobbing juliet hugs the lifeless romeo to her
o my true love romeo
she looks to the gun in his hand
track quickly past captain prince and the capulets taking cover behind a patrol car
two police officers urgently convey montague and his wife toward them
discover father laurence arriving
cut to father laurences p
patrol cars lights flashing surround the mausoleum
he sees through the open door of a police car a hand cuffed youth
it is balthasar
father laurence hurries to him
it is dawning on father laurence
i brought news of juliets death
and then in post came romeo from to this same place
to this same monument
close on father laurence
how long hath he been there
full half an hour
father laurence turns towards the mausoleum
a shock of realisation the lady stirs
track slow toward juliet sobbing uncontrollably she prises the gun from romeos hand
father laurence desperate breaks through the police line and runs toward the mausoleum
cut to the parents and captain prince
go not forth
juliet turns the gun on herself
close on father laurence he screams as he mounts the mausoleum stairs
the lady stirs
the sound of a single gun shot rips through the night
cut to captain prince
cut to the parents a look of cold shock
cut to the priest his cry echoes through the night
juliet lies peacefully on romeos chest
her eyes awake
a wash of deep red blood floods across them both
as we move away from the forms of the two young lovers lit by a ring of candles the police burst in guns ready to resolve what has already been
continuing up we pass through the glass dome of the viewing chapel and over the building
there huddled at the base of the mausoleum steps are the montague and capulet parents and father laurence
from high up we see captain prince emerge from the mausoleum and speak to the group
a moment then their cries float gently up
we are travelling high into the sky now
the cries of the parents and the buzz of radio calls fade to nothing
as the sun struggled to rise we push toward the figure of jesus silently surveying the city
as jesus face fills the screen droplets of water begin to streak his cheeks
hold music swells the droplets grow to a torrent and a heavy rain begins to fall
for a long beat we stay with this image
crane down from the jesus
a sea of black umbrellas stretches back from the steps of freedom tower
at the top of the steps are a pair of flower strewn caskets
before the caskets stand fulgencia and gloria capulet and ted and caroline montague
they stare with blank uncomprehending sorrow
among the crowd we see the distraught faces of benvolio balthasar father laurence and the nurse
the caskets are gently slid into a pair of long black cars
montague and capulet descend the stairs
captain prince blocks their path
he holds them in his gaze
see what a scourge is laid upon your hate that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love and i for winking at your discords too have lost a
brace of kinsmen
all are punished
the prince steps aside
the procession moves off
montague and capulet look to one another a moment and then the two adversaries together follow the bodies of their dead children
aerial shot the rain falls
two black cars lead the people of verona beach in a sorrowful parade
as the cars pass beneath the towering effigy of jesus the image pixilates into a television picture
pull out a tv anchor woman watches the image on a studio monitor
she turns to camera a glooming peace this morning with it brings the sun for sorrow will not show his head
go hence to have more talk of these sad things
some shall be pardoned and some punished for never was a story of more woe than this of juliet and her romeo
the anchor woman changes beat to the next story but her dialogue fades and her image gets smaller as the television recedes into a black distance
the music that reminds us most of these two lost lives swells
when the television is very small it is switched off
