brown begin on black
the sound of rain driving into trees
something wipes frame and we are suddenly hurtling through a forest on the shoulders of a wild eyed kilted john brown
drenched hair streaming head swivelling left and right as he searches the lightening dark
a crack to his left
he spins round raises his pistol smacks past saplings and plunges on
close up on brown as he bangs against a tree and heaves for air
a face in its fifties mad fierce eyes handsome bruised lips liverish
he goes on searching the dark
listens through the rain
thinking he hears a faint thump in the distance he swings round and races on
brown tears through the trees pistol raised at full arms length breath coming harder and harder
but even now theres a ghost grace a born hunters grace
he leaps fallen branches swerves through turns in the path eyes forward never stumbling once
brown bursts into a clearing breaks to the centre and stops
with his pistol raised he turns one full slow circle
his eyes take in every swerve and kick of the wildly swaying trees
theres a crack and a branch snaps behind him
he spins round bellows deep from his heart god save the queen
the trees go on swaying the storm goes on screaming and brown just stands there staring into empty space
slowly he starts to frown as the fact begins to dawn on him that he is alone
he stares at the thrashing trees waving their mocking arms at him
his hand lets the pistol drop to his side
he feels the rain drench down his face
and now for the first time we see that his socks have fallen to his ankles and his knees are cut to shreds
he shifts a foot
his dress shoes are covered in mud
he goes on staring into the dark
just the wind and rain
gradually we pull back higher and higher
as we do we hear the quiet cultivated voice i have sent for a mr
john brown from balmoral
her majesty has mentioned him on one or two occasions as being a most devoted outdoor servant to prince albert during his last days there
john brown is now just a tiny figure dwarfed by the storm
the screen is black
as the camera pulls back we discover that we are looking at a black night gown
queen victoria is sitting at her dressing table while an elderly hairdresser also in black works at her hair
the depths of the queens sorrow remain impenetrable
she has now restricted herself to a regime of such ferocious introspection that we are all at our wits end
a bust of the prince consort is draped in black
his desk is laid out as if for work
a valet is brushing one of his suits before laying it carefully on the bed
the household continues at her instruction to observe the rituals now so familiar to her in a vain attempt to render vivid that which can never be revived
close up on a small table as a shaving brush is placed carefully beside a dish of freshly poured water
the hairdresser is pulling victorias hair back into the widows cape
for the first time we see her face
it is set in a mask of severity
it will not surprise you to hear that she continues steadfast in her refusal to accept any public engagements however trivial
a bronze cast of prince alberts hand hangs above the royal bed
his sleeping gown is laid out on one side
a somberly dressed middle aged man stands by the bed doctor jenner the queens physician
he is placing potions and medicaments in a row on the bedside table
behind him two maidservants are busy stripping and remaking the bed while another raises the window to air the room
family and staff expend all their efforts endeavouring to draw her out of this state of unfettered morbidity but to no avail
indeed doctor jenner will not undertake to vouchsafe her sanity unless some remedy is found
victoria is turning slowly around as a young assistant dresser completes the fastening on her black crepe dress
we must hope therefore that this mr brown will appeal to the queens sentimental though deeply held view that all highlanders are good for the health
if she can at least be persuaded to take the air the prospect of further recovery may seem less remote
the assistant dresser pulls too tightly on her dress
victoria winces slightly
terrified sorry maam
we glide slowly past the coastline as a caption reads a driver stands against the sea front with a horse and cart bearing the royal coat of arms
john brown leads his pony along the dockside towards the waiting driver
he is in his late thirties fit handsome and dressed in tartan kilt and short jacket
he is arriving by boat this afternoon by which time it is hoped her majesty will be in a fit state to consider riding out
sir henry ponsonby the queens private secretary is sitting at his writing desk completing a letter
as to that decision along with all others we remain as ever prisoners of the queens grief
beat ever your devoted husband henry
he folds the letter and slips it into an envelope
he is a middle aged man in a dark mourning suit tall saturnine and with a civil servants stoop
as he looks up we see a white stockinged footman standing to attention by the door
ponsonby hands the letter to him
a series of windows are being slammed open by white stockinged footmen as members of the royal family and upper household hurry by in silence all dressed in mourning and
rushing to make the luncheon hour
queen victoria heads down the empty corridor with two ladies in waiting lady ely and lady churchill hurrying along a pace behind
members of the royal family and upper household hurry into the icy dining room and take their designated places at the luncheon table
everybody is dressed in mourning and nobody speaks
wind whistles through the open windows
among the diners we catch our first glimpse of bertie the prince of wales
he is in his mid twenties plump stiff dressed and balding
he stands next to his young wife princess alexandra who fiddles nervously with her shawl trying to keep warm
as bertie smooths down his thinning hair doctor jenner bustles into the dining room stands himself next to ponsonby and proceeds to conduct a hurried conversation with the prince of
wales entirely in whispers
congratulations your royal highness
thank you doctor
a boy i hear
beat albert victor
eddie for short
what do you think
a fine choice sir
john brown leads his pony gently up the ramp and into the carrier bearing the royal coat of arms
the driver leans in
are you riding up front
brown looks straight at this man quiet and reserved
ill stay with the pony thank you
shes all the way from deeside and shes not sure she likes you yet
the driver shrugs and slams the doors on them
victoria reaches the dining room door and takes a deep breath
lady ely and lady churchill stop a pace behind
lady ely is slightly taken aback
the royal family and senior members of the household maam
victoria closes her eyes then steels herself and steps through the door
everyone stiffens as victoria walks in
acknowledging the other diners with a quick nod the queen takes her place
she flaps open her napkin and bang on cue everyone else sits and does the same
the meal is served immediately by waiting servants who plonk the food down without ceremony
its a very ordinary meal of meat and vegetables
victoria starts eating heartily straight away
everyone does the same
only the clink of cutlery and the same eerie silence
the royal horse carrier rattles into the grounds and on down the driveway past the beautiful manicured lawns stretching away towards the ornate twin towers of osborne house
a few outdoor servants watch its progress curiously
the silence continues as victoria finishes her plain pudding
immediately servants appear at every place and whip away the pudding bowls whether their owners have finished or not
nobody thinks this odd it is part of the routine
doctor jenner clears his throat
were expecting brown this afternoon maam
victoria takes a sip of water dabs her mouth with her napkin and rises
everyone else rises too
suddenly the queen turns to berties nervous wife princess alexandra and proclaims abruptly thats a very pretty shawl you are wearing alex
silk suits you well
beat but you are not eating enough
one must not let vanity overrule ones appetite
victoria nods earnestly
lost to the effect her words have had she marches out again
behind her she leaves princess alexandra feeling humiliated and crestfallen in front of all the others
bertie takes her hand and squeezes tight trying awkwardly to console
the horse carrier pulls up outside the servants entrance and the driver opens the doors
john brown pulls out a watch from his waistcoat and checks the time
his eyes narrow critically
i was due at a quarter past one
beat youre late
a few minutes later john brown strides down the long corridor with ponsonby at his side
their journey takes them down an endless series of corridors past servants and householders hurrying about their duties
the presence of the dead albert is felt all around in the black wreathed portraits and busts that crop up along the way
brown and ponsonby could not be more contrasted
in low tones her majestys routine at osborne house is not as you will remember it
the household remains in full mourning and no one is permitted to raise their voice under any circumstances whatsoever
as for the queens routine she breakfasts at nine thirty lunches at two takes tea at five thirty and dinner at eight forty five
no one is allowed to leave the building while the queen is at home
on the rare occasions when she is out you may ask permission to leave but only with my consent
youre to be ready to walk the pony at any time after ten oclock
youll clean her outdoor things and do any odd jobs as and when she requires
how will i know
surprised to be interrupted im sorry
how will i know what she requires
youll be sent a message
wholl bring it to me
her highness equerry
i need a man who knows where i am
im sure it wont be difficult to find you
thats not good enough
then well have to see what can be arranged
there is to be no communication with other members of the household on matters concerning the court except through myself or one of the equerries
no plans must be altered unless you are given prior authority by myself or a senior member of the household
i came down at the queens request
ill take my orders from her
in matters concerning the household i act on her behalf
brown takes the measure of him
beat i do
brown glances up the corridor
so is passing wind out of the question or do i need permission for that
ponsonby refuses to acknowledge what he has heard
they reach the door of the royal chamber and he concludes the interview
as i am sure you remember from balmoral you do not talk while in her majestys presence unless her majesty addresses you directly
brown refuses to answer so ponsonby knocks
after a moment the door is opened by lady ely who ushers them in
brown walks stiffly into the room and stops
ponsonby waits by the door
mr brown maam
victoria is bent over the desk working at one of her numerous red boxes
she scribbles furiously at a letter underlining and accenting words as she goes
finally lady ely steps up to her side and whispers something in her ear
she carries on working
brown has time to survey the room
dominating everything are the same black wreathed busts and portraits of prince albert glimpsed in the corridor
finally victoria nods and lady ely beckons brown forward
he steps up in front of the desk and waits
victoria looks up and brown bows deeply
she stares at him for a long moment without apparently registering who he is
he towers over her in bright tartan while she sits hunched in her seat all in black and knotted with tension
finally she finds her voice
she sounds nervous and edgy
you are here safely
you are well
and the pony
shes well too
victoria blinks at the sight of him
his presence is bringing him back
your family sent cards
it was much appreciated
im glad of it
in an effort to control her emotions victoria now sounds the same severe note as at lunch
but brown unlike others seems unaffected
my husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you
he would have approved i am sure of my calling on you in this way
beat i trust it does not inconvenience you too much
ive no family maam apart from my brothers and sisters
beat you have a brother in service here do you not
furrowing her brow i forget his name
beat that will be company for you
victoria starts to tire
she takes a sip of water and spills a little on herself
flustered she searches for a hanky but cannot find one
lady ely hurries up with one of her own and the queen dabs it off
brown watches all of this with genuine concern
when victoria finally looks up he stares at her in deep sympathy
honest to god i never thought to see you in such a state
you must miss him dreadfully
victoria stares back in stunned silence
ponsonby coughs involuntarily
lady ely freezes
you do not he
get him out
beat get him out
get him out
suddenly brown finds himself tugged backwards out of the room
lady ely rushes up to assist as victoria shouts herself into a fit of uncontrolled sobbing
some minutes later brown is angrily unpacking a trunk
his humiliation expresses itself in the extraordinary ferocity with which he slams down every object
his younger brother archie sits on the bed
hes in his early thirties bright sharp and dressed in the same distinctive kilt and tweed
telling it fast so the day they arrive she greets the sultan and his family with barely a word and then retires to her chamber
the sultan not used to state occasions without a head of state is standing in the lobby waiting for someone to tell him what to do
but the court is under strict instructions not to talk in the corridors so nobody speaks to him not a living soul for the whole afternoon
so now its dinner and everyones standing round the table still not a word waiting for her majesty to arrive
one hour goes by two the sultans getting a wee bit peckish to say the least
so finally his wee laddy breaks for the cold meats and stuffs a slice in his mouth
well the uproar when she heard
youd have thought someone had stolen the crown jewels
brown stares back still pissed off
so there are rules
things you do and things you dont do
i was just telling the woman how i feel for gods sake
you dont tell her majesty how you feel
i speak as i find archie
not down south you dont
brown slams a drawer shut
archie lets it go and watches his brother
so what did ponsonby do when she started shouting
i think he nearly ruptured his truss
a beat then both men burst out laughing
the clatter of voices and banging doors as under servants hurry about with plates knives and forks laying the upper servants huge table for dinner
archie leads brown through this rush of activity
seventy a year
not bad not bad
how about yourself
grinning thats pretty good for a ghillie
brown smiles dryly
they pour themselves a drink from the table
is he the one who bleeds all day
so what does his valet do
wash his poultices for him
its better than shovelling horse shit
if you were looking for promotion you should have picked one of the healthier ones
shes hardly a full hamper herself
beat its only grief makes her like she is
three years john
is that not a bit long to be grieving
she loved him
come on man
theres love and theres
you know what i mean
im not sure i do archie
theres love and theres behaving like you do because theres nobody to tell you not to
hold on brown
he lets it go and moves on
across the hall he spots the pretty assistant dresser watching them
which one of us is she flirting with
the good looking one
then shes obviously not got enough to do
you work the system right you could ask her yourself
just be thankful youre not working for household
the queen never lets them out of her sight
but wee spats like us can slip through the net easy
brown stares straight at him
im no wee spat archie
the next day victoria and her ladies are hurrying down a corridor on her way into the dining room
victoria suddenly stops and stares out of the windows
her entourage are several steps past her before they realize whats happened and scurry back to take up their positions behind
now we see what has caught her attention
brown is standing in the courtyard below by his pony
she watches him for a moment then without reacting walks on
some hours later
it is now raining
a gaggle of royal grandchildren hurry out of a carriage from their afternoon recreational while their nannies frantically try to keep them dry under the umbrellas
john brown stands tall and erect on the gravel while they rush around him laughing and giggling
rain on the window
victoria is walking in the opposite direction down the corridor with her entourage
she stops at the same place as before
as if she had not seem him earlier who is that
lady ely peers through the rain
its mr brown maam
what is he doing there
he appears to be
standing by his horse
i made no request to go out riding today
beat how long has he been there
i dont know maam
nervously he was observed earlier i believe
at this moment ponsonby comes down the corridor
sir henry mr brown is standing in the courtyard
i have no wish to go riding
im very sorry maam
i cant imagine he was certainly given no instructions
please make sure it does not happen again
of course at once
victoria takes one last look and walks away
half an hour later ponsonby stands at his desk facing what on earth did you think you were doing
brown stares straight back
awaiting my orders
you do not report for duty unless the queen requests it
you know that very well
i didnt come all this way to sit on my arse
you will await your orders like everyone else
unless you prefer a repeat of yesterdays little excitement
i beg your pardon
the next day
from a high window we see ponsonby scuttling madly across the courtyard towards the figure of john brown who is standing exactly as he was the day before
victoria watches impassively
ponsonby stands close to brown shouting in his face
i thought i made myself perfectly clear
you do not leave your room until her majesty requests it
eyes straight ahead shouting back well you tell her majesty from me if her husband was here now hed have had her out of that house and getting some air
what the hells the point in me being here otherwise
from the window above victoria takes in his words
ponsonby collects himself
go inside at once
is that the queens request
yes it most certainly is
brown turns grabs the lead rein and leads his horse back to the stables
a few minutes later brown is in the process of stabling his horse
suddenly he turns
victoria is standing at the far end of the stable with her entourage
you have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so
then why do you persist in doing it
because i think her majesty is wrong
if ever there was a poor soul who needed fresh air it is her
the queen will ride out if and when she chooses
and i intend to be there when shes ready
the two of them stare at each other
the next day high and wide over the stunningly manicured landscape
long lawns wind cropped copses and in the distance the glittering sea
victoria sits side saddle on a horse
brown leads her in silence
victoria looks up
prince albert was going to build a bench here
he thought it one of the best views in osborne
its a fine spot maam
he thought so yes
she stares ahead
in everything i do and everything i say i try to think as much as possible what he would do or say if he were here now
my private secretary wishes me to return to public duties she stops abruptly but brown cuts in
if prince albert were here today hed tell him a thing or two
sir henry is not alone
they all wish it
beat the same people who refused to grant my husband the title of king because he was deemed of insufficient rank she stops again cutting quickly back to small talk
it is a fine spot for a bench is it not
i have some letters in the saddle bag
i wish to read them
brown walks up to her side opens the saddle bag and hands her a bundle of letters held together with ribbon
i cannot read them like that
brown undoes the ribbon and tries again
victoria cuts in
you will hand them to me as i require
brown takes off the top letter and hands it to her
the clatter and crush of the upper servants table as upper servants sit themselves down to dinner while under servants prepare to serve soup
archie comes in and sits himself somewhere in the middle next to an empty seat
a moment later brown strides in
but instead of sitting at the place beside his brother he goes straight to the head of the table and plonks himself down
slowly the clatter dies away as the whole room stops and stares at him in silence
brown fixes them with a look
an elderly butler steps into the room and stares in amazement at brown
a smooth young man berties valet hurries up to intercede
carter the head butler sits there
not now he doesnt
this is my place
by whose authority
a little frisson of oh my gawdness
berties valet stares icily at him
the order of seating at the upper servants table is arranged personally by the queen herself
thats a tautology lad
unable to stop himself seriously explaining it if you say the queen arranges something youve no need to say shes done it personally
but as far as berties valet is concerned it isnt
he stares down in mute fury then snaps his fingers at one of the under servants who rushes over
there is a hurried exchange of whispers before the under servant rushes out
unperturbed brown brings out his flask and pours himself a substantial draft of whiskey
he turns to the pretty assistant dresser sitting to his right
are you dresser to her majesty
she blinks nervously at him
assistant sir yes
brown tucks into his soup
everyone watches and waits
whats your name
mary taylor sir
have i seen you up in balmoral mary
i hope to go up next year
you wouldnt happen to know what the queens reading for recreation would you mary
the assistant dresser thinks for a moment
lord tennyson sir
all conversation stops as the under servant bursts back in
she halts at the door looking blankly from berties valet to the elderly butler
the old man stiffens and makes his way to the middle of the table
brown looks up from his soup
am i the only one eating
with a clatter of spoons everyone obediently eats
a few days later
a morning drawing room
standing round the unlit fireplace are doctor jenner lady ely lady churchill the two ladies in waiting and princess alexandra
all are dressed against the icy wind that whistles through the open window where victoria sits knitting busily while bertie stands beside her coat buttoned up to the collar
ponsonby has stationed himself opposite beside a desk piled high with red dispatch boxes
he runs through the daily itinerary
lord clarendon arrives by invitation at eleven oclock followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate princess alices birthday
dispatches as usual at two
finishes then coughs the chancellor writes to say that by happy coincidence he will be in cowes for the weekend
he asks if your majesty might grant him an audience
he thought perhaps your majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government
i shall be out walking
bertie watches closely now
ponsonby coughs again nervous
then perhaps your majesty might consider it opportune if the prince of wales were to meet him on your behalf
she speaks without turning
on no account
ponsonby gives up
politely but firmly bertie takes up the reins
mama i really do think its time we made ourselves a little more
victoria carries on knitting
i think we must accept our position in the country is not entirely unrelated to the continued absence of the monarchy from public life
silence i thought perhaps we might consider a small gesture of some kind
victoria looks up sharply
i thought a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps
cutting in firmly no dinners bertie
beat why are you dressed for outdoors
its so infernally cold in here
cold is good calling across is that not so dr
im sorry maam
cold is good
excellent maam excellent
trying his hand but perhaps if her majesty were to consider accompanying her new found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity
becoming very agitated why am i being lectured in this way
forgive me your majesty
in no way did i wish to suggest cutting across him i will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy
least of all my son
it was his irresponsibility that drove my husband to his grave
an appalled silence
with great dignity bertie absorbs the shock of the insult and quietly steers the conversation in another direction
if it is inconvenient to her majesty then perhaps she might consider allowing the prince of wales to host i do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me
doctor jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after
box after box
victoria has crossed to the window and stares out at the view
having recovered her composure she turns to address them all
i wish to take the princesses for a swim
for a moment nobody believes what they have heard
the turns i have been taking in the grounds have proved most beneficial to me and brown thinks that salt water will do me good
bertie stares at her in silence while ponsonby and doctor jenner exchange a worried look
the doors of the royal bathing machine swing open and queen victoria in a voluminous swim dress sails out like a duck into the freezing sea
as she does so the doors of the other machines open and princess helena and princess louise follow her in
dignity does not allow them to shout out but their expressions of constipated agony are a picture
victoria begins swimming around in a vigorous little circle
dont potter children
hold for a moment on the princesses miserable faces
half an hour later ponsonby doctor jenner lady ely and two footmen watch as brown helps victoria up some steps and onto her horse
he glances at the stiff line of householders and mutters curtly to himself
you could buy that lot for garden ornaments and still see change from ten guineas
the household do not hear this but queen victoria has overheard and tries to suppress a smile
as she settles into the saddle her foot comes loose
brown fastens it into the stirrups
lift your foot woman
everyone hears this
taking the reins he then walks the queen out of the courtyard
as they vanish from site we hear
this nation is fortunate in so much as it is not governed by force
the speech continues as we follow the progress of a tomahawk cartoon doing the rounds of the tory back benches from knee to knee
it is entitled where is britannia
and shows an empty throne draped with the royal cloak
but by a chain of traditions that have been cherished from generation to generation because in them in our traditions are embodied all the laws which have enabled us to
create the greatest empire of modern times
during the above the cartoon reaches the front benches and lands on the knees of the young earnest stanley
as he frowns at the picture in front of him disraeli winds up
but even though we have amassed great capital and even though we have established an industry with no parallel in the world yet all these mighty creations are as nothing
compared to the invisible customs that shape our lives
to those honorable gentlemen of the opposition who seek to destroy the essential elements of this country i say let them remember england cannot begin again
during this peroration we see disraeli for the first time
he is handsome obviously jewish and wire thin like dickens on slimfast
he dresses almost dandyishly but speaks with startling vigor a combination of brilliance and cheek that is his key
to cheers from his back benchers he sits
as he looks up he catches the eye of his opposite on the liberal benches
gladstone is different in almost every respect dour dogged heavy set and tall
they stare levelly for a second then disraeli flashes a brilliant smile
stanley plops the cartoon on his lap
have you seen this
a few minutes later disraeli and stanley are strolling down the busy lobby corridor
throughout their talk tory back benchers bustle up to pat their hero on the back and offer their congratulations
should we take it seriously
the cartoon or her majestys absenteeism
the question is do we need her
surely youre not suggesting we dispense my dear stanley a prime minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion
the pass gladstone in a huddle of cohorts
lord aberdeen was right
this country is not governed by wisdom but by talk
beat granted it wouldnt take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning but if public opinion is against her then it doesnt do to appear too close
well see which way the wind blows
disraeli sweeps through a prattle of back benchers
brown and archie crash into the water
it is freezing
brown braces himself against the icy shallows by bellowing burns at the sea
my hearts in the highlands my heart is not here
my hearts in the highlands a chasing the deer
chasing the wild deer and following the roe
my hearts in the highlands wherever i go
archie is so creased up with laughing he almost drowns
a few minutes later brown and archie hurry back up the cold beach to rub themselves dry
brown is very energized
one box of biscuits one box of drop tablets one box of pralines sixteen chocolate sponges
its the same order every week but does anybody bother to check it
now she has to travel all the way to balmoral without the few luxuries she actually enjoys
someonell send it on ahead
aye but will they
john its not your problem what she eats
the womans surrounded by fools
beat she has to be packed and ready to leave by seven thirty tomorrow morning
knowing that lot theyll still be dressing her at eight
brown takes a nip of whiskey and offers some to his brother
shes got an army of people to get her up and out
but im the only one she trusts
archie stares at him
shell blow hot and cold on you john she always does
you want to be careful
im on ninety pounds a year plus seventy pounds for a pile of tartan id be wearing anyway
thats as much as a page of the back stairs gets and that jobs only for toffs
raising his hip flask triumphantly at the sea im her majestys highland servant
indoors and out
theres no stopping me now
a few days later
the clatter of carriage and horse as the royal party thunders through gathering dark toward balmoral castle
a mass of torches encircle the royal party as kilted ghillies and staff swarm round the carriage opening doors and clambering off boxes while a regiment of pipers play them
amid this swarm of activity we glimpse brown opening the door to a smiling victoria as she climbs down followed by princess helena and princess louise
emerging from another carriage come bertie and princess alexandra staring grim faced at the castle
henry ponsonby and doctor jenner alight from their carriage as ponsonby slips on his gloves and pinches his nose at the pain of remembrance
oh god not the pipes
the next day
high over the vast bleak mountains of lochnager and loch muick
victoria and brown are riding fast towards the top
reaching the summit victoria points excitedly at the far horizon
what are those
those over there there
horse chestnut trees
craobhan geanmchno fhiadhaich
beat craobhan geanmchno
bursts out laughing how can i possibly say that with a straight face
brown lets it go and they ride on
i am thinking of publishing my highland journals
are they worth reading
beat i am told so
sir henry ponsonby tells me they are charming
what does he know about the highlands
he has been attending at balmoral for many years
that doesnt make him an expert
his remarks were directed at the quality of the writing not its subject
i dont groom a horse to have it admired by others i groom it because it needs grooming
curtly i do not do it for others
but ponsonby thinks they are good
just say what you have to say woman
what other people think shouldnt matter to you
snapping of course i shall say what i have to say
i always do
the stare at each other until brown kicks his horse on
aye well if all you want is a good opinion then hed be sure to oblige you
riding alongside what mr ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming
beat literary appreciation does not begin and end with tennyson
brown lowers his head
in a softer tone i mention you in them
brown says nothing
in particular the occasion when albert was alive the royal carriage overturned during a storm and you demonstrated such loyal service in returning the queen and the princesses safely to
taking a sprig of heather from her brooch victoria holds it out to him
a few days later ponsonby doctor jenner and brown stand at the chamber desk talking over the queens itinerary
briskly shell be away on friday between eight oclock and six in the evening to visit the grants in glasalt
if shes to make the journey there and back in the day shes to have no distractions the night before
shell take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early
shell need to sign dispatches before she retires
that can wait till the weekend
there are important papers from it can wait
are you sure her majesty is up to such a long journey
she has only just recovered from a severe head cold
if i thought she wasnt up to it i wouldnt let her go would i
brown snaps together his papers and walks out leaving ponsonby and doctor jenner standing lamely at the table
the next morning
the royal family are picnicking in the grounds
victoria walks along a path accompanied on one side by brown on the other by bertie
bertie is in mid plea
surely it is for the gentlemen to decide when to stop
it is a disgusting habit bertie
it should be discouraged
yes but isnt midnight a little excessive
it is quite late enough
but mama the room was built expressly for that purpose
it has been a smoking room by tradition ever since father cutting in angrily browns responsibilities are onerous enough already
he has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed
the smoking room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve oclock
and that is my last word on the matter
well im sorry but i really do think its too much that the gentlemen of the house should be dictated to by a servant
its the queens decision
i beg your pardon
to victoria mama
before bertie can continue brown steps right into his face
i think you should go now
beat youve tired your mother enough
bertie stares back too stunned to speak
he glances at his mother but victoria looks off into the distance as if she has not heard
bertie turns and storms away
john brown is standing in the doorway of a small cottage watching with amused detachment as a middle aged couple mr and mrs grant race about their tiny living room
trying desperately to make it presentable for the queens sudden visit
they fling open the windows slosh water on the fire tidy up their two grubby boys plump up the cushions dump knitting under the sofa and try to smarten themselves
up all in the space of a few seconds
theres really no need for this
ill not have her seeing it like it is
beat i know she means well but i wish shed warn us she was coming
she thinks if she warned you youd go pouring water on the fire and stuffing the knitting under the sofa
aye well you cant stop a wife being house proud
mrs grant surveys the room critically
beat show her in
victoria sits on a horse and trap
brown steps out and helps her down
theyre ready now
i hope they didnt go to any trouble john
victoria steps in to be greeted by all four grants in one military row smoke still steaming off the fire
brown stands behind her barely able to contain himself
but for victoria it is all shes ever known and so she takes it as perfectly normal
how good it is to see you
bowing deeply your majesty
how is your knee
has the pain eased a little
bobbing in terror oh not so bad maam
oh and here are douglas and john
havent you grown
still bobbing away growing all the time maam
mr grant remembers himself and gestures victoria towards a chair
will you sit maam
from his place by the wall brown notices how easily she smiles as she is led to the chair
she points to a picture on the wall and her good humour is infectious
i know that
thats cairn lochan
we picnicked there once did we not john
a few days later a party of aristocrats ministers diplomats escorts businessman and whores
into this brouhaha come disraeli his elderly wife mary anne and the young stanley
it is all eyes and nods here
everyone knows everyone
ah the greasy pole
dont be facetious dear
remember your position
its my position im thinking of
across the room stanley spots bertie amid a crowd of acolytes
i see the prince of wales is here
i hope he got his mothers permission
stanley smiles faintly
disraeli homes in on a punter and raises his hand already working the room
the society party is hotting up
stanley is deep in conversation with three society ladies
ridiculously pleased with herself why is the queen penny wise and pound foolish
because she looks after the browns and lets the sovereigns take care of themselves
a peal of naughty laughter
unseen disraeli steps up
and in your opinion
is she foolish
the society lady stares blankly back
well i mean to say its hardly right is it
well the queen and appalled whisper mr brown
disraeli stares at her steadily already thinking ahead
la superstition met le monde entier en flammes
thick as shit i beg your pardon
changing tack has anybody seen this
he is her personal servant i believe
knowingly follows her wherever she goes
he would hardly make a very good personal assistant if he did not
brown stands by a wall smiling to himself at the sight of queen victoria struggling to help lay the table while mrs grant nervously prattles on
its not my best china
i mean it is my best china now but the family set got stolen last summer
oh im so sorry
of course it was no one on the estate
more likely one of the lads from braemar
or further even
beat ill fetch the salt
mrs grant scurries away
victoria immediately holds up the spoons to brown with a questioning look above or beside the plate
he nods her to the top and she quickly carries on
disraeli and mary anne stand with bertie and his acolytes
your royal highness
what a pleasure to see you here
have you met mr lyle
hes in sugar
i dont think ive had that pleasure
disraeli shakes hands with the fat sugar tycoon who wobbles with drink
mary anne engages him in conversation while bertie turns disraeli aside
no doubt youve heard the rumors
i take no account of gossip your highness
my concern is for the reputation of the monarchy
i fear the influence he has on her
the mans word is not to be credited
he is an arriviste of the very lowest water
beat shes having a bust cast of him
in nero marquino marble
i would talk to her myself but she wont listen to me
she must be persuaded by someone she respects to abandon this ridiculous favoritism before a situation develops
i dont imagine you frequent the republican clubs
but the fact that neither you nor i are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence
beat the tory party has always been our party
im flattered you think so
i tell you if we dont stick together on this you could find yourself first presidents opposition
murdering it du royaum uni
i dont think we can overstate the seriousness of this
disraeli nods and bertie walks swiftly back to his party
the moment hes gone stanley steps up to disraelis side
what did he want
to know when hell be king
victoria brown and the grants are eating around a large table
like a wife watching her husband victoria beams proudly at brown as he tells a story
so grant here and myself are riding over lochnagar and the rains pouring down in sheets and all were thinking about is getting home for a drink when through the
gloom grant spots a couple of poachers
he gives me a shout and we chase them down towards the loch until grant has your men up against the stacks and hes shouting and cursing at them why
are you poaching on royal land
and one of the little fellas looks up at him and says coz weve come up in the world
for a split second both the grants look petrified then brown and victoria explode into laughter and the grants relax
suddenly the grants are helpless with laughter too
beginning with victorias glass brown pours out liberal quantities of whiskey all round
later that night the courtyard is packed with a gaggle of worried householders holding lamps
through the light brown and victoria clatter into the courtyard on the horse and trap
doctor jenner breaks through the crowd in a state of high excitement
thank goodness youre safe
ill have a bath prepared immediately
i recommend macdonalds african embrocation cutting in ah pipe down man
the womans fine
we stayed a little longer than expected with mr and mrs grant
it was most agreeable
we were expecting you to return by six
and now i am back
brown cannot resist one more little dig
we took a nip of whiskey
to keep out the cold
victoria smiles and brown lifts her off the trap
before walking in she turns and in front of everyone says
thank you john
brown bows and the queen walks on
as she straightens up he finds ponsonby and doctor jenner staring back at him in utter disbelief at what she has just said
he turns and leads the horse back to the stables
under his breath shes drunk
ponsonby doesnt answer
he is watching brown very closely
a distinct flushing around the cheeks
she was drunk i tell you
no she wasnt
jenner turns to look at ponsonby
ponsonbys face is set hard
dont even think about it
a crush of kilted ghillies as we slam into the height of the annual ghillies ball
the whole court is reeling through the dance all of them beholding the extraordinary spectacle of queen victoria and john brown dancing together in the middle of the hall
ponsonby and jenner stand by the wall watching
close up on ponsonbys face as jenner mutters darkly
with a slam of feet the reel ends the ghillies roar and brown and victoria stand smiling at each other in silence
a king and his queen
later that night
we find brown slouched on the ground dead drunk and snoring loudly
a few days later four journalists are scrabbling up a stony path armed with telescopes
a large royal party is making its way smoothly and quietly up the mountain
brown is on horseback leading victoria on a dapple grey
the journalists rattle up the hill
brown and victoria start pulling ahead of the main party
the journalists scramble up to some gorse bushes dump themselves down and start setting up the telescopes
brown and victoria near the summit when brown suddenly stops
he stiffens and turns to face the wind as if catching a scent
what is it john
i heard something
browns eyes fix on some distant gorse bushes
i wont be long
he dismounts and races off
the journalists are peering through their telescopes
where did he get to
ive lost him
below them brown races across the riverbank and undergrowth unseen
i dont know if theres much worth writing about
hard to tell
brown rears up above them and stops
this close enough for you
on your way
you filthy scavengers
the journalists scramble to their feet and start legging it down the hill while brown roars furiously hurling their bags after them
you leave her alone do you hear
the journalists vanish below the hillside
brown is standing at the head of the table yelling at the upper servants irrespective of archie or anyone
if i catch the miserable by blow who told those men where shed be then ill hang his balls to dry on jock wemyss so i will
archie glances up at berties valet
he is staring down at the table teeth gritted fists clenched
brown rounds on them all again
what happens to john brown is his business but the queens security will never be compromised
we youll talk when im finished
berties valet stares at him in astonishment
brown turns back to the table
that kind of disloyalty will not be tolerated in this house is that clear
beat yelling i said is that clear
there is a general mutter of assent
brown turns and storms out as archie gets up to follow
a few days later ponsonby is sitting at his desk hands to his hips listening quietly as doctor jenner reads from his copy of punch
court circular balmoral
beat on tuesday mr john brown enjoyed a display of sheep dipping by local farmers
on wednesday he attended a seance where he was pleased to listen to a recital of auld lang syne by mr robert burns himself
brown crashes through a door holding a copy of the same journal
on thursday mr john brown walked on the slopes accompanied by family and friend
brown storms up to ponsonbys door
mr brown retired early
brown bursts in on ponsonby and jenner slamming down his copy of punch on the desk
he is furious but controlled
if i find out that you had anything to do with this i will have you sacked
i believe that decision rests with her majesty
dont think i cant persuade her
i dont doubt that the queen was highly amused
she has always had a very healthy sense of humor
this is a slur on her good name
in as much as the article is about yourself i think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you
nobody has any rights over me
we are all of us subject to forces beyond our control mr brown even you
brown stares at him in silence
youll regret saying that
the tories are losing the vote as both sides of the house stand and shout at each other while the speaker rises in his chair
a buzzing silence settles as the house sits for the vote
the counters approach the chair
result of the vote to the first reading of the bill to disestablish the irish church
a murmur of excitement from the liberals
ayes to the right three hundred and thirty noes to the left two hundred and sixty five
by the time he reaches sixty five his voice is drowned in cheers from the liberal benches
disraeli and the rest of the front bench sit in stony silence
somewhere on the liberal back benches a wild eyed maverick dilke rises to his feet shouting mr speaker i table a motion in furtherance of the bill to disestablish the
a roar from the irate tories and chaos reigns again
an hour later the house is empty except for a few straggling mps hurrying home
an exhausted disraeli stands in the corridor with stanley
were going to lose
you cant know that for sure
gladstones got his party facing the same way for the first time in years
we need help
long beat where is the old girl
its questionable whether theres any advantage to be had from that direction
shes never been less popular
in the press perhaps
holding up punch but shes sold more copies of her highland journal in three months than punch will ever sell in a year
time to wheel her out
shes refusing to leave balmoral
whats her excuse this time
the princess louisa is too ill to move
frankly the queens rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity
beat youre smiling
i was trying to imagine rather upset
the elderly prelate dean wellselly hurries in through the lobby doors
disraeli puts on a welcoming smile
forgive me gentlemen
not at all dean
good of you to spare the time
i came as quickly as i could
youve seen the latest cartoon in punch i take it
completely lost i beg your pardon
disraeli opens the copy of punch and hands it to dean wellselly
the dean clears his throat and starts to read
as wellselly reads one of our madder brethren in the house was calling for disestablishment of the monarchy
dean wellselly looks up from the article horrified
playing the soft glove im sure it wont come to that
the hard glove no
but it has now become a matter for our consciences
beat i was just telling stanley how vital it is that the nation should feel the visible influence of the sovereign
as a reminder that parliament indeed my own ministry depends on the will of the queen
dean wellselly nods his head gravely
over his shoulder stanley is gaping at disraelis silky distortion of the party political maneuver into a moral imperative
i couldnt agree with you more but i am only dean of windsor
i dont understand what
we hear from balmoral that mr brown is interesting her majesty in some of the forms of worship associated with
low church presbyterian
dean wellsellys face is a picture of unrestrained horror
what can we do
oh several things
some days later
queen victoria sits at her desk while henry ponsonby stands in front of her holding a copy of the times
ponsonby coughs once and begins again
the times wishes to join the rest of her majestys loyal subjects in expressing its deep joy at the news that the queen is soon to come out of her
victoria glowers at him
who told them that
i have no idea
i forgive me maam i am no wiser than yourself
suddenly victorias temper goes and she shouts at him
no one should think themselves wiser than me
beat it is not for any of the queens subjects to presume to tell her majesty when and where she should come out of mourning
it is the queens sorrow that keeps her secluded
it is her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility work which she feels will soon wear her out entirely
your majesty cutting right through him is it not enough that she is uncheered and unguided that she should also have to suffer these malicious rumors
a pause more quietly i am not a fool
beat i know there are those in the establishment too afraid to attack me and so they attack my dearest friends
sometimes i feel that brown is all i have left of albert
beat and now they attack brown too
she looks up eyes blazing
i will not give him up to them
brown is guarding the door to the drawing room while the balding bertie muscles up eye ball to eye ball
i wish to see my mother
convey her a message
shes away to windsor tomorrow
talk to her there
tell her the prince of wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press
are you deaf as well as stupid
a split second
bertie gapes at him
what did you say
i said are you deaf as well as stupid
do you know who you address sir
whom you address
the future king
well everyones entitled to their opinion
out of my way
foolishly bertie tries to barge his way past
suddenly brown loses it completely
he grabs the prince of wales by the shoulders and pins him back shouting right into his face
for a split second browns eyes flicker as he senses he has gone too far
a look of pure venom in berties face then
in a roar of hooves and wheels the royal carriage sweeps into the huge quadrangle
john brown stands rigid on the box glowering at all the world
a pair of doors open out onto a torchlit driveway as a mass of servants rush in and out ferrying bags an trunks
brown marches in still charged up from the strain of the journeys watchfulness
he spots an under porter snatching a break
whats your business here
jumping to under porter sir
well dont stand where you shouldnt
the under porter scrambles up the stairs
a few servants exchange looks
brown seems more determined than ever to exert his control
carrying an old storm lamp high over his head brown walks towards the stables
the next day
brown is on horseback riding with victoria through the grounds
he is still jumpy eyes flicking left and right searching for intruders
they are being followed at a distance by two equerries on horseback
victoria frowns peevishly
must they always follow us
i ordered it
its for your own safety
dear me youll be telling me to watch what i eat next
brown doesnt react
am i not safe enough with you john
looking away but there are fenians reported on the mainland
tutting irritably the threat from the irish is greatly exaggerated im sure
snapping back ill decide when its exaggerated
brown chucks his horse on bringing a firm halt to the conversation
he pulls up suddenly staring at the shadows in the copse
is anything the matter john
he stares for along moment and then lets it go
nothings the matter
brown marches down the line of horse boxes
a stable lad barney is feeding the horses
he looks twitchy
mr brown sir its cold out there tonight barney
reaching his pony brown stops and smiles
the animal lifts its face to him and he softly strokes his muzzle
yeah theres a good girl
to barney have you had a look at this hoof
she was limping badly
i think there might be a stone in it
yeah yeah i did
and is she all right
shes a good girl
yeah shes a lovely girl
and you know the queens riding tomorrow
beat are you all right barney
barney twitches again and brown realizes too late
the split second he turns he sees three men
the men pile onto him and he collapses under their weight
as he falls brown manages to yank himself round bang up a fist and fling the others off him
but the first man is up again twisting an arm round his neck and tugging him back
the others grapple his arms down but brown is incredibly strong
even now grunting and scrabbling he makes them fight to force him back
barney stands transfixed in horror
dumping brown against the wall the men step back and start kicking the shit out of him
brown curls into a ball jaw locked hands over his head
not a sound
finally they back off panting hard
the first man pulls out a bottle of whiskey yanks back browns head and forces whiskey down his throat
it spills over his face and dribbles down his neck
the next day
victoria is standing at the windows
the door opens and lady ely walks in
mr brown is unable to attend today
i believe he is unwell maam
i understand he was in a fight
has he been hurt
i believe not maam
i understand hed had rather too much to drink
victoria walks away and steps behind her desk
you may go
lady ely bows and walks out
victoria stares at the desk a moment then picks up her pen and tries to work
brown sits on the edge of the bed in only his undergarments
his face arms legs and fingers are livid with bruises but he sits there stiff backed and gritting his teeth while archie crouches in front of him tending to his
and she sent no word down
they said you were drunk
beat why dont you tell her the truth
shell think its her fault for keeping me
archie completes one of the dressings when brown suddenly reaches back and starts trying to put on his shirt
what are you doing
im getting dressed
youve got three broken ribs man
ive got my duties to attend to
dont be an idiot
youre in no fit state to go anywhere
shell be worried about me
shell get over it
i cant let her down now archie
and when was the last time she put herself out for you
look john whatever she says to you now in the end youre still a servant
oh im much more than that
aye she may say that to you but the woman can say what she wants
you watch your tongue
come on man im telling you what you already know
you know nothing about her
when are you gonna see it john
she doesnt give a damn about you
brown lunges for the bedside drawer and pulls out a card showing a coy picture of a pretty woman
he holds it up eyes blazing
from the queen
he reads out the inscription
my lips may give a message better of christmas love than een this letter
beat to my best friend j
from his best friend v
he thrusts it in his brothers face best friend
she means it
archie stares at him
shell drop you
when shes done with you shell drop you
archie steps back but brown roars at him
archie steps outside and brown is left alone
the next day
victoria sits at her desk
ponsonby hands her letters to sign
to be followed by a visit from lady bridport
she is keen to secure a place for her niece as maid of honor
victoria signs the last letter and sits back
i am tired
there is one other matter
what is it
i have a letter maam
from princess helena and other members of your family
stiffening defensively my family is quite capable of communicating with the queen in person
ponsonby does not reply
finally victoria is obliged to ask
what do they want
they are demanding the dismissal of john brown on grounds of drunkeness
victoria stares through the window expressionless
victoria walks through the ornate chapel nervously fingering her handkerchief
waiting for her smiling softly is the dean of windsor dean wellselly
you wished to see me maam
she holds his eyes for a moment then nods
a few minutes later victoria and dean wellselly are seated in a corner of the chapel talking softly
she cannot bring herself to look at him and so does not notice how carefully he is watching her throughout the interview
this is incredibly hard for her to say but she struggles to be as honest as possible
my husband tried always to make me think more subtly
of course he taught me so much and i can never repay my debt to him or the love i feel even now
but in truth i think i am someone who can only feel things while they are alive to me
for that reason i know i do not have a subtle mind
i know that
but i work hard and i try to do my duty
she hesitates she is struggling now however i have noticed of late that my feelings of grief are not so strong and that i find myself leaning more upon the
comfort of living friends
beat friends close to me now
she stops herself
she is crying
dean wellselly watches her a moment then speaks close choosing his words carefully
your majesty a settled resignation is more lasting proof of affection than active grief
if the good lord sees fit to bring one into contact with congenial fellow beings one should not analyze ones reaction too deeply
to allow oneself to be comforted by someone else need not imply any disloyalty to the memory of the loved one
victoria stares into the long dark chapel
gradually as she takes in the tone of his remarks her disappointment turns to anger
the next day victoria stands at the far window and her back to the room
lined up against the wall are bertie and his siblings
ponsonby steps forward
please tell the princess and other signatories to this letter that the queen will not be dictated to or made to alter in any way what she has found to
answer for her comfort
beat do i make myself clear
you may go
they all file out
a few days later
brown and victoria are riding on horseback
although better than he was browns face is still badly bruised
they turn a corner banked by trees
brown is watching the queen closely
i would like to get down
without a word brown dismounts and helps her off her horse
i was told you were in a fight
has someone seen to those bruises
having considered my position here at court i have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of your majesty that i should resign
i do not accept
i had foreseen that you would not
but your majesty should understand that my mind will not be changed in this
i leave for deeside cutting in the queen forbids it
beat i cannot allow it because i cannot live without you
without you i cannot find the strength to be who i must be
she takes his hand to her mouth and kisses it gently then looks at him utterly helpless
promise me you wont let them send me back
a long silence
brown holds her hand tight
a few weeks later
a tiny horse drawn carriage creeps across a huge highland landscape
yesterday gladstone talked for three hours on the irish church bill
i am as guilty as the rest of underestimating his reforming zeal
tory days may be numbered but i fancy there yet remains one last hope of deliverance
wheresoever the blame lies we must now close ranks and defend mrs browns england
as for my interminable journey to the land of calvin oatcakes and sulphur
disraeli hurries through the pouring rain
no prime minister made greater sacrifice than attempting to run the country six hundred miles north of civilization
reaching the castle he hurries inside and the great doors bang behind him
the next day
queen victoria is playing the piano like she walks with great vim and vigor
the tune is some quaint scottish ballad which she belts out in her clear strong voice almost drowning out prince arthur prince louise and prince leopold who are meant to
be accompanying her
they stand in a nervous semi circle fumbling their harmonies
ignoring them completely victoria bobs up her head with a quizzical smile to make sure she is being appreciated
disraeli and the rest of the household stand a few yards off smiling rigidly
disraeli the consummate politician to his inch high insteps out smiles the lot of them
this man is in raptures of delight
and the more liquid his smiles the happier he makes victoria
he beams she belts until her children are drowned out completely
and then with characteristic suddenness victoria stops playing and launches into one of her tirades
the household wobbles in shock like children on a switch back but disraeli glides smoothly from delight to sober concern
how dare the irish break with the anglicans
if albert were alive today he would never allow the crown to give up church patronage
no the irish must be told very firmly to stay exactly where they are
it is the thin edge of the wedge mr disraeli
next you will be telling me that the crown no longer governs this nation
a nervous silence in the household
your majesty remains at the very epicenter of governance
as for your people look no further than the sales of your highland journals to see in what affection the nation holds their queen
beat you sell even more copies than mr dickens
but i lack your prose mr disraeli
victoria gives him a tiny smile
disraeli acknowledges it then steers the conversation back
of course i understand your concern
you miss your people
a pause and they miss you
victoria registers a slight flicker of defensiveness at the implied criticism
then they may read about me
indeed and for that they are eternally grateful
is that not enough
in so many ways
and yet it is your presence they crave
victoria has the measure of him
i never thought to be bullied by you mr disraeli
you i thought understood a widows grief
forgive me maam i cannot speak for the nation only for myself
as prime minister i confess i miss your presence but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and i should not burden you with it
the household waits
has he clawed himself back
victoria acknowledges his apology
her voice drops and she talks directly to disraeli straight from the heart
i stay here because i am happy
beat is that such a terrible crime
at this moment the far door opens and brown walks in
time for your walk
without a word victoria rises from her chair and starts following him out
as they pass disraeli she stops
this is my good john brown
taking him in yes
i have asked him to show you a little of highland life while you are with us at balmoral
brown measures disraeli suspiciously
what brings you here
a man can refuse only so many invitations from his queen
it was remiss of me not to come earlier
what do you know about the highlands
i am a blank sheet
do you hunt
dare say you can be taught
to shoot perhaps but not to kill
if you hunt you kill
disraeli counters effortlessly
well then ill do my best
staying close to the ground we develop through a series of shots showing the other highlands sheet rain against heather and gorse rivulets of water slashing through mud crude pathways
sliding in wind and all ball breakingly cold
coming up the hill we begin to make out a hunting party
the sound first
like a small army crashing their way up the winding path
ghillies urging on their horses and dogs guns and equipment jangling off pony hacks an then the tall figure of john brown striding out in front
making no concession to anyone he force marches them up the hill eyes on the hunt ahead
behind them trot the men on horseback disraeli ponsonby bertie and other gentlemen each led by ghillies and attendants among them suddenly brown stops and raises a hand
the party halts
he listens for a second
satisfied that he has found his quarry he brings his hand down and the party of gentlemen dismount as quietly as they can
as he waits brown winces slightly from the pain in his side
he pulls a flask of whiskey from his sporran and drinks
all the time disraeli keeps his eyes on brown
everyone is now fanned out along the hillside a ghillie to each gentleman slowly and silently moving up the hill
disraeli stalks with brown panting hard to keep up eyes on his man trying to make no sound
suddenly brown stops
very slowly he rises
disraeli rides alongside and sees
a huge stag staring majestically across the hillside
keeping his movements smooth and slow brown brings up his rifle cocks it and offers disraeli the kill
with a deferential gesture of the hands disraeli declines
brown stares at him a split second raises the rifle to his shoulder and fires
a rapid montage of guns firing as we cut to
brown sweeps in from the hunt disraeli dripping at his side
demonstrating with his rifle always remember you keep it tight to your shoulder you absorb the kick
aim for the head
then imagine its gladstone
brown pulls out his flask and offers some to disraeli who declines
he watches brown take a long swig
brown is standing at his place drinking steadily
he has a sheet of paper and a pen and is ticking off a list
lined up in front of him trying desperately not to laugh are five or six upper servants including the pretty assistant dresser and berties valet
they each step up one at a time to make their report
ticking as he goes back doors west wing
checked and locked sir
side doors east wing
checked and locked sir
creasing up checked and locked sir
kitchen and lower house
checked and locked sir
back and upper corridors
checked and locked sir
beat checked and locked
folding up the paper brown downs his glass of whiskey and sits
on his nod dinner is served by under servants amid a clatter of cutlery and chat
archie looks across at his brother but brown is hunched over his plate pecking at his food
someone titters and archie looks up
berties valet coughs
brown slowly lifts his head
his eyes have the slightly unfocused look of too much drink
it is clear to archie that he is about to be sent up
with a smug smile did you see any irish assassins today mr brown
brown doesnt react
we heard the dogs were fenian sympathizers
or was it the stag
everyone bursts out laughing
brown slams down his glass
theres not a soul here cares about that wee womans safety except me
shed die in a ditch if i wasnt there to look out for her he stops
archie has come across to his brothers chair and pulls gently on his arm
brown stares at the servants
everyone is about to burst out laughing
keeping his dignity he pushes back his chair and lets archie lead him away
as brown reaches the double doors the laughter hits him in the back like a wave
archie holds him steady
brown is lying on a grubby bed
archie is looking around the untidy room
for the first time he notices a thick manuscript on the table
brown follows his eyes
its a diary
be careful who sees it
what do you take me for
archie turns back to brown
you should have someone look after you
im all right
i just need to rest up a wee bit
feeling everything spin the room
you dont have to stay
brown shuts his eyes and starts to drift
archie watches over him
the place is a mess
i cant move to tidy
its what the maids are for
im not having some prattler going through my things
wont you give yourself a rest john
shes other people to look out for her
she needs me archie
she canna do without me she said it to my face
his hands come up to cover his eyes how can i stop now
dawn the next morning
brown is scrambling into his jacket as he hurries down the stairs
brown crashes out of a side door just fully dressed to be met by the smiling figure of disraeli
he is got up in smart walking boots plus fours and a tweed jacket
you sent for me
ive been called back to london
my last day
i thought i might take a walk on lochnagar
brown stares straight back
an hour later brown leads disraeli up the hill
brown has his head down on with the job
disraeli slows to a halt
princes and lords are but the breath of kings an honest mans the noblest work of god
beat you must miss such magnificent views
i dont think about it
they reach the top and continue along the high ground
disraeli glances at brown and notices the limp
forgive me ive called you out and you should have been resting
still someone must attend you
your wife should not have let you out
im not married
this is the top
disraeli admires the view for a moment then continues
i confess i sometimes feel as if i am not married myself i see my wife so little
but im forgetting the rewards
he looks across
brown keeps staring ahead
the look on their faces when one walks into the room
still gives one a ridiculous thrill
i wouldnt know
surely interrupts what i do i do for my queen
was there never ambition
beat maybe once
then i envy yo
to have achieved ones ambition or to have reconciled oneself to its limits is a lifetimes work
i do what i do
for her majesty
beat what about john brown
beat i serve the queen
no other aspiration
brown stares for a long moment
finally he speaks
to see her safe
disraeli steps a little closer
you will not be unaware of the threat now posed by republicanism
why do you think i keep her here
ah but therein lies the paradox
it is her very isolation that encourages the malcontents
the longer she is away the stronger they become and who honestly can promise security against that
however many doors you lock someone will always get in
brown watches him eyes alert
the truth is the queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public
john bull loves her and john bull is her best defense
her mind is set
she wont change now
she trusts you john
disraeli is right on his shoulder now like his own voice
they dont see it
beat i tell them but they dont see it
they arent as watchful as you
too busy looking after themselves
the greasy pole
for a moment brown seems unaware that someone else has said that
i promised to protect her from people like you
for once in my life i am not the issue
shell never understand it
in time she will
shell think i betrayed her
but others will know that you acted for the greater good
brown stares off into the distance
the next day
brown is rowing victoria across the loch
the equerries wait on the shore
victoria trails her hand in the water frowning at the surface
brown concentrates on the oars slipping them carefully through the water
i received a letter today from mr disraeli
parliament is calling for my return to public duties
beat why wont they let us be
brown does not answer
he insists that the country expects me to preside over the opening of the new session
i refuse to offer sustenance to enable his weakening grip
besides you know how much i should hate it
it frightens me
she notices that brown has said nothing
brown does not look at her
finally we cant always have what we wish
victoria stares at him
later that day
victoria and brown are in the middle of a blazing row in front of the entire household including ponsonby jenner and lady ely
you talk about duty
if duty and safety are served by the same end then aye i do
i cannot believe you are saying this
you who i have relied on all this time cutting in have i ever let you down before
as if he had not spoken you stand there and tell me it is my duty
after all you promised me
im breaking no promises
you are forcing me to do the very thing you know i fear most
for gods sake woman im just trying to keep you safe
i will not hear any more about my safety
you made me a promise and now you have broken it
brown rounds on her deeply wounded
when i took you out riding come rain or shine because i knew it was right for you when i kept the bairns off your back so you could have
a bit of peace when i saw you safe from home to home and you didnt even know i was there
all ive ever thought about is you
then why send me back to them
because i have to
pause will you no listen to me woman
face turned from him victoria replies in a brittle voice
do not presume to talk to your queen in that manner
a long silence
brown watches her but she will not look at him again
finally she walks very slowly across the room
she turns in the doorway her voice faltering slightly
doctor jenner i feel unwell
i shall retire to my chamber
please attend me presently
as the door slams we
a few weeks later
close on a door as it opens
the royal family are eating lunch with members of the upper household
victoria walks in with lady ely
a great scraping of chairs as everyone drops their forks and stands
clearly they were not expecting her
in silence victoria steps up and takes her place at the head of the table
at last ponsonby leans forward deferentially
may i say how glad i am to see your majesty so much recovered
victoria nods then turns and looks about at the others
princess alexandra is seated at the far end of the table
where is my son
prince albert is at windsor maam
why is he not here
he is sick maam
then why are you not with him
you ordered all members of the royal family to attend you at balmoral
what is the matter with him
he has typhoid fever maam
victoria stares blankly at doctor jenner
you are mistaken
prince albert my husband had typhoid fever
i asked what was wrong with my son
the same your majesty
she stares down the length of the table
a long pause
why was i not informed
i did not consider it wise in the circumstances to tax your nerves
how ill is he
to alexandra alex
he is not well maam
i must go to him
suddenly victoria stands
chairs bang back as everyone leaps to their feet
we must leave at once
abruptly victoria turns for the door and the room erupts into activity
brown stands in the corridor a little nonplussed by the servants and householders hurrying about in every direction
half an hour later brown races up to the queens carriage amid a swarm of servants ladies maids and householders rushing to be ready in time
suddenly the huge castle doors open and victoria bustles out with her entourage in tow
brown only just in time yanks open the door for victoria to step past him and take her place
she ignores him completely
brown slams the doors
as he looks up he sees his brother archie staring at him from across the courtyard
for a second the two brothers hold each others gaze
its obvious that archie has noticed the queens indifference
brown turns away and mounts the box as the carriage races away under him
some days later
queen victoria sits at the foot of the bed a matriarch surrounded by her royal family
they watch doctor jenner bend to examine the ghostly figure of bertie
he listens for a pulse
finally he looks up
victoria lets out a deep breath
she takes hold of princess alexandras hand
should the good lord see fit to spare my son i will order a mass to be celebrated at st
the people must share with their queen her prayers and hopes for their future king
a few minutes later brown stands in the corridor when the door bursts open and victoria marches straight past him with ponsonby at her side
aside to brown the queen will be riding to st
georges on the fifth
launching straight in i recommend her majesty uses the covered carriage with a full horse guard
in the event of any disturbance i will ensure cutting in i will ride to st
georges in an open carriage
it is time the queen was seen by her public
victoria turns and disappears down the corridor followed by ponsonby
we linger on browns humiliation closer and closer until
some weeks later
a series of angles on brown as he walks amid the mass of onlookers pressing against a cordon of guards surrounding the cathedral
all the time his eyes flick left and right searching the faces in front of him for potential assassins
over his intense watchfulness we hear
praise and magnify thy glorious name for that thou has raised thy servant albert edward prince of wales from the bed of sickness
we pray thee to perfect the recovery of thy servant and to crown him day by day with more abundant blessings both for body and soul through jesus christ our
the congregation mutters a vast
victoria and other members of the royal family walk down the steps towards the cheering crowd
as dean wellselly and brown follow brown sees arthur oconner break from the onlookers pulling out a gun
brown yells out he races toward oconner and hits him flying bangs him to the ground and twists the gun out of his hand
as they fall we hear laughter and so there he is arthur oconner
its a few days later and bertie is entertaining a private dinner party
they include queen victoria princess alexandra princess louise and henry ponsonby
brown is in attendance
he stands off to one side near the door
bristling with confidence all seven stone of the man paddling madly towards us through a sea of horse guards waving something that looks vaguely like a pen
i thought he must be one of the mothers ardent readership in search of the royal indenture
victoria watches her son smiling proudly
brown looks straight ahead
i believe i saw him first and then alerted brown
im not convinced that he wasnt taking a snooze on top of the box
anyway we had our man pinned down and i must say brown acquitted himself admirably
of course the gun was a fake but all the same it was well done
no one registers brown
but while victoria does not look at him she is acutely aware of his presence
i intend brown to be rewarded with a special medal cast in gold
it will be called the devoted service medal
the guests applaud politely
bertie clinks his glass for attention and raises it high
the others raise their glasses in unison
brown remains alone by the door
the people of england have expressed in a manner which cannot be mistaken that they will uphold the ancient monarchy of england
disraeli is delivering his come back speech at a banquet of tory delegates
if the first great object of the tory party is to maintain the institutions of the country the second is in my opinion to maintain the empire of england
the hereditary the traditionary policy of the tory party
go to your homes teach them these truths which will soon be imprinted on the conscience of the land
the sound of rain driven hard against a window
we creep slowly down the corridor until we are back with the fifty year old brown
with his whiskey for company he is sitting at his desk writing in the diary
the diary manuscript is now falling apart with wear but there remain a few blank pages
slowly he fills them in
we should not live in expectation of contentment
fifteen years of vigilance will not guarantee peace of mind
yesterday intruders were again reported in the south wing
i believe my prompt arrival may have averted any crisis but it was a timely reminder
it is a great comfort to me that my efforts in securing the queens safety over the years have not been in vain
certainly her majesty sends me no word that shes dissatisfied
and i feel sure that if she were unhappy she would have found the occasion to speak to me in person as she has so often done in the past
a knock at the door
what is it
we hear a young page breathless from running
north woods sir
brown grabs his gun and rushes out
brown appears at the door and strides into the storm
he walks quickly across the wide quadrangle rain soaking his hair and clothes
two guards watch brown as he races out into the storm
a coin flips through the air to be caught by an outstretched hand
the second guard grins
brown races across the open ground towards the forest
and now we are back with the opening sequence
truncated severe and shot from a slightly different angle
the driving rain brown hurtling through the trees the crack to his left he spins and plunges on
close up on brown as he bangs against a tree heaving for air
he searches the dark stops listens and races on
brown tears through the trees pistol raised at full arms length
he bursts into a clearing breaks to the centre and stops
pistol raised he turns a circle eyes on the wildly swaying trees
a branch snaps behind him
he spins round bellows deep from his heart god save the queen
a few days later
victoria is moving swiftly down a long corridor with lady ely
they arrive at a door
victoria stands facing it
quietly how long has he been this sick
a few days maam
why was i not told earlier
lady ely doesnt answer
victoria knows anyway
lady ely knocks
the door is opened by a young under servant who gawps at the sight of her majesty standing here in the servants quarters
victoria walks in
the room has been cleared of bottles but the thinness of the life here shocks her deeply
the cheap furniture the anonymous prints the bed and finally the sight of brown
he is lying in bed barely conscious
after a moment he opens his eyes and stares at her
she steps forward smiling nervously
her voice is the old voice between friends
you should never have gone out in such foul weather
someone has to look after you
pause it couldve been someone
it was before
yes it was
he cannot speak
its difficult for her too but she speaks for him
my ministers are as impertinent as ever
dispatches are now so numerous they come in a trunk
sometimes i do believe they will never stop
her voice falters
a pause i know i have not always been the loyal friend you deserved john
and yet here i am now even now feeling desperate at the thought of losing you
she starts to cry
dont be silly woman
his old familiar gruffness makes her smile and she pulls herself together
seeing a bowl of water on the side table she steps across
carefully folding a cloth in four she rinses it in the water and gently wipes his face
leaning closer she is about to touch his face when brown gestures protectively
not too near
a week later
ponsonby and jenner stand at the window overlooking the grounds
not too protracted i hope
shakes his head a few days
beat when he heard the prince of wales threw the bust from the window of the royal gallery
it took four hours to gather the fragments
the queen wishes to publish an account of him
dear oh dear
we think she can be dissuaded
beat have you had a glance at the diary
beat i think id best take it back
he brings out browns tatty diary manuscript and hands it over to ponsonby
the two men move away from the window to go their separate ways
daily business beckons
where did you find it by the way
some young page was boasting about having seen it
well no rest for the wicked henry
the two men head off in opposite directions down the corridor
