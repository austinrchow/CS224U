ghost world b
b if window
href b b by and we move through the city in a series of brief shots that define and establish our setting from commercial district to residential neighborhood
eventually we find ourselves moving down a street of two story apartment buildings
many of the windows are lit from within by an eerie blue light
as we track past at window level we see a glum sedated looking couple watching tv
an ignored toddler runs amok behind them as a cheery commercial plays
an empty room
a large hirsute man wearing only lycra jogging shorts watching the home shopping network while eating mashed potatoes with his fingers
a dazed old woman staring out the window
the silhouette of a teenage girl dancing by herself
we enter her room and see the tv screen
the source of the theme music is a video of an insane east indian production number from the s
the room is cluttered with heaps of clothes old records odd knick knacks
we see her silhouetted back as she dances along to the video while trying on a a modern high school auditorium
over the entrance a banner with a coca cola logo reads graduation today pm
a graduation ceremony is in progress
we dolly past the bland faces of teary eyed graduates until we stop on enid
at first we only see the top of her mortarboard as she lifts her head we see that shes trying desperately not to laugh
she makes eye contact with rebecca another graduate who is also trying to stifle her laughter
the speaker is in an elaborate wheelchair with severe looking traction devices
high school is like the training wheels for the bicycle of real life
it is a time for young people to explore different fields of interest and to hopefully grow from their experiences
after all that which we learn from our mistakes can be as valuable as what we learn from our textbooks and often we can turn the negative experiences that are
common to all high schoolers into positive steps toward personal growth and achievement
in coming to terms with my own personal setback which im sure youve all heard about ive been able to learn a lot about myself
ive learned for one thing that i dont need to rely on drugs and alcohol and that im very lucky that more people besides carrie and myself werent hurt in
the accident ive learned that im blessed with wonderful parents teachers and above all the best classmates in the world i love each and every one of you guys
and ive learned that to get through lifes obstacles you need faith hope and most of all a sense of humor
a trio of teenage girls one white one asian one black come running out from the wings and start dancing and rapping
the audience loves them
no more education
its time for celebration
cause this is the day of our high school graduation
weve stayed for the duration
now were the newest members of the general population
the auditorium door opens and graduates emerge
enid rebecca run away from the crowd triumphantly holding rolled up diplomas
they run toward the school playground nearly bursting with excitement over their long awaited release
enid stops and looks back at the school
she gives it the finger
they sit on a see saw out of breath
god what a bunch of retards
i thought chipmunk face was never going to shut up
i know i liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict
she gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden shes little miss perfect and everybody loves her
its totally sickening
she unrolls her lets see if they gave me the right diploma
enid opens hers
instead of a diploma its an official looking document with a pink post it note on the front page
oh suck my fucking dick
these assholes are saying that i have to go to summer school and take some stupid art class
remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year
i didnt think that just because you get an f that means you have to take the class over again
the sign reads welcome graduates
party in progress in the gold room
a band plays top lite rock watching band this is so bad its almost good
this is so bad its gone past good and back to bad again
close up on enid we see the party from her pov the six or seven most popular students huddle closely together
just think well never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again
unless theyre in your summer school class
dont turn around
melorra an ambitious incessantly upbeat classmate approaches them
oh my god you guys
i cant believe we made it
yeah we graduated high school how totally amazing
so what are you guys doing this summer
im going to be in this actors workshop and im hoping to start going on auditions soon
im so excited to finally have some free time
we have to get together this summer
oh yeah thatll definitely happen
spotting better people to talk to well bye you guys
since when is she an actress
i know she needs to die immediately
todd a friendly but slightly below average looking guy approaches from behind
we finally what about me
am i not even here
oh hey enid
starting over so
we finally made it
awkward pause so
where are you going to college
before rebecca can answer were not
both of you
we have other plans
i guess i should have figured that you two would do something different
what are you going to be when you grow up todd
well im going to major in business administration and i think minor in communications
see thats exactly the kind of thing were trying to avoid
pause todd starts to talk again but enid has noticed something off to the side
i enid grabs rebecca and turns her away from todd before he can finish his sentence
oh my god look
is stacy himmler going out with rod harbaugh
he better watch out or hell get aids when he date rapes her
todd forgotten walks away
the singer wails a sappy maudlin ballad
enid spots dennis the class loser wandering around by himself
god just think well never see dennis again
god think about that
thats actually totally depressing
the quality cafe is enid and rebecca s hangout
a ish man with shaved head and his vaguely diabolical wife sit eating lunch
enid is drawing a picture of them in her sketchbook when rebecca arrives
look at these people behind you
im totally convinced theyre satanists
just look at them
rebecca turns and makes eye contact with mr
she calmly turns back to face enid before cracking up
so when are we going to start looking for our apartment
i have to wait and see how this summer class goes
did you sign up yet
yeah i just picked the one that sounded the easiest
god its so weird that were finally out of high school
weve been waiting for this our whole life
now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want
its such a weird feeling
i know it hasnt really hit me yet
enter john ellis an obnoxious young man with a perpetual smirk
well if it isnt enid and rebecca the little jewish girl and her aryan friend
youre late asshole
fine and how are you
did you bring that tape
he puts a videotape on the table just out of reach
you never paid me for that tape with the indian dance routine
i did too
you jews are so clever with money
fuck you you stupid redneck hick
hey look the satanists are leaving
we should follow them
as the satanists walk outside they open umbrellas even though its a bright sunny day
oh my god look
the girls get up to follow them
enid grabs the videotape
to john thanks for the tape ill have to pay you later im broke
hey where are you going
in fact never
under harsh glaring sunshine the girls follow a half block behind the satanists
what do you do if youre a satanist anyway
you know sacrifice virgins and stuff
that lets us off the hook
the satanists continue slowly along with enid rebecca still following
maybe theres some weird secret satanic society that meets at the quality cafe and all of the other regular customers are in on it except for us
or maybe not
maybe theyre slowly poisoning us or theyre planning to brainwash us and okay okay
hey look at this
enid points at the mini mall in front of them
a new restaurant we see their banner grand opening
wowsville authentic s diner
since when were there mini malls in the s
god its so totally pathetic
theyre in a booth looking at menus
its a less accurate version of johnny rockets
a golden oldie from the s plays on the jukebox
who can forget this great hit from the s
i feel as though ive stepped into a time warp
the waiter approaches
he has an ostentatious s style perm
check out the awesome fifties hairdo on the waiter
hi my name is allen and ill be your waiter this afternoon
can we call you weird al
our specials today are pasta vasilio which is a pasta salad with a light basil vinaigrette that was a popular dish in the s huh weird al
i imagine so
also we have a spinach tortellini in a ricotta sauce
both of those are
shall i give you a few minutes to mull it over
i just want an order of onion rings
i might actually get the pasta special
pasta special and an order of onion rings
did you notice all those weird things on the menu
like the salad explosion
and instead of dessert it says mindbenders
what does that even mean
enid spots an abandoned newspaper the free weekly on the adjoining table
check out the personals
maybe our future husbands are trying to contact us
god this paper is so boring
who reads all this shit
flips through it until she gets to the personals here we go
reading windsurfing doctor mensan iq maverick sagittarius
lets hit the clubs make each other laugh
you can have that one
okay well heres yours
reading who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken
not this one
stunning bod very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer
al returns with their food
can i get you ladies anything else or are you all set
later i might be interested in one of those far out mindbenders
enid goes back to the paper
listen to this one do you remember me
airport shuttle june th
you striking redhead with yellow dress pearl necklace brown shoes
i was the bookish fellow in the green cardigan who helped you find your contact lens
am i crazy or did we have a moment
god thats so pathetic
i bet she didnt even notice him
and hes like psychotically obsessing over every little detail
we should call him and pretend to be the redhead
oh we totally have to
enid tears out the ad and puts it in her sketchbook
cu of sketchbook
enid and rebecca sit with rebeccas grandmother oomie in her living room
they eat tv dinners while watching oomies favorite tv show which we hear but dont see
so what happened next donna
then i told him hed better take out his hose and pump me
my car was out of gas
enid leans toward rebecca
whispers does oomie really like this show
whispers isnt it weird
its her favorite
enid and rebecca exit
rebecca looks through enids sketchbook while enid fiddles with the remote fast forwarding through a tape in the vcr
so what should we do
i just want to see whats on this tape
what is this
john ellis always puts on all this sick stuff that i have to fast forward past to get to the good stuff
theres supposed to be a don knotts movie on here someplace
sound of fast forwarding
rebecca glances up from the sketchbook
wait what is that
enid stops fast forwarding
we dont see the screen but we hear weird sounds like boots walking through deep mud
enid lurches forward to avert her gaze
she clicks off the vcr but leaves the tv on
she notices a photo album on a bookshelf under the television
hey why do you have this
you lent it to me in like tenth grade
ive been looking all over for this
angle on album as she leafs through it
we see a picture of a five year old enid with glasses
look at how cute i am
what a little hosebag
angle on photo of eleven year old enid rebecca at a party
look thats back when i hated you
i remember every minute of that party
another page theres my dad with joanie
i can never keep them all straight was she the super bitch
no she was the second wife
the third one was the super bitch maxine
finds a picture there
look at her
angle on photo of maxine
what a fucking monster
something on tv catches rebeccas eye
oh my god
this is that comedian i was telling you about
you have to see this guy hes the absolute worst
a dead pan comedian joey mccobb is doing his stand up routine in a standard brick wall comedy venue
he has a contrived im a weirdo shtick
just because i live with my mother people think im peculiar
so what if shes been dead for fifteen years
peter lorre laugh god thats barely even a joke
as i always say take my life
if hes supposed to be so weird how come hes wearing nikes
joey mccobb ladies and gentlemen
joey mccobb is our god
i want to do him
actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with you always go for guys with some lame fake shtick
what are you talking about who
that larry guy what look was he going for
a gay tennis player from the forties
rebecca turns the page of enids sketchbook to the torn out personal ad
we forgot to call the loser
you know the green cardigan guy
rebecca goes to the phone and offers the receiver
why do i always have to do it
youre better at it
as she dials i remember when i first started reading these i thought dwf stood for dwarf
ear up to phone what does it stand for
shh its his answering machine
pause we hear the indistinct traces of a musical message followed by a faint hi its me your striking blonde
of course i remember you
lets get together for lunch sometime
how about friday at one oclock
why dont you meet me at my favorite restaurant wowsville
its in the mall on century parkway
ill see you there darling
and be sure to wear that sexy green cardigan
as enid hangs up they both start laughing
a franchise convenience store with a western motif
josh is taking his apron off as his boss a humorless greek immigrant counts out the cash register
cheerful muzak plays
ah ah ah
what you think you doing
you still got five minutes left on you shift
enid wearing wraparound shades rebecca enter
well hello there young employee of the sidewinder
look i already told you im not going to give you a ride
what can you tell me young man about the various flavors of frozen yogurt
look ill be done in a minute
just wait outside
im afraid i dont understand
i simply wish to know the flavors were featuring this week in addition to old favorites chocolate and vanilla are six gun strawberry wild cherry round up and ten gallon
i dont believe i care for any of those
a customer doug enters a lowly specimen with bad hair cut mustache and jail house tattoos wearing filthy designer jeans and no shirt
i need two packs of smokes
im on a double shift tonight
fuckin sixteen hours man
doug brings a ouncer to the counter
josh has two packs of newports waiting for him
hey and gimme six of these beef jerkys too im hungry enough to chew the crotch out of a rag doll
i told you no shirt no service
as he leaves fuck you man
look can we talk in a minute
im almost done
enid looks at herself in the security mirror
she takes off her hat and messes up her hair
she then takes off her shades and replaces them with her standard horn rims
nudging enid points outside look at this
outside we see doug practicing with nunchuks and drinking a beer
heavy metal music blares from his car radio
the boss sees this and goes out to yell at him
you get out of here
josh joins enid rebecca on the other side of counter
that guy rules
he spends more time here than i do
so josh will you give us a ride
its going to be super fun
forget it theres no way
find some other poor sucker to abuse
josh is driving chauffeur like with the two girls relaxing in the back seat
why do you even need a ride
you could walk there in two minutes
its just an excuse for us to spend time with you
enid and rebecca giggle
so josh if this guy freaks out will you protect us
he has every reason to freak out this is a totally fucked up thing to do to somebody
god i think josh is too mature for us
i know look at the way he drives
hes like an old man
yeah josh cmon
their car accelerates
the three of them are seated at a corner booth
a song from any decade other than the s plays on the jukebox
a businessman enters
look maybe thats him
its still twenty five minutes early
arent there a million places like this
this is the ultimate
its like the taj mahal of bad fake s diners
so wheres weird al
hes back there
i can see his hair bobbing up and down
i want to make love to him
im going to tell him you said that
weird al approaches with menus
so nice to see you again ladies
hey weird al theres something my friend wants to tell you she says she wants to mmph
rebecca puts her hand over enids mouth
angle on old woman slowly sweeping
we follow her back to enid rebecca josh
theyre now eating ten minutes have passed its
becky and i are trying to figure out what makes you tick
tell us about your political beliefs
no im serious
give us your whole basic philosophy in a nutshell
oh my god look thats got to be him
a guy enters
is he wearing a green cardigan
what exactly is a cardigan anyway
the guy joins a friend
thats not him
jesus stop freaking me out
in answer to your question i suppose i endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form
i figured something like that
oh my god
they see a somewhat funny looking guy in his late s wearing a green cardigan seymour enter
enid and rebecca hunch down in their seats
its obviously him
i cant believe it
seymour sits down and looks around
weird al brings a menu
another angle on weird al bringing his milkshake
ten more minutes have passed its
whats going on now
whats he doing
oh my god he just ordered a giant glass of milk
bursting her bubble its a vanilla milkshake
fifteen more minutes have passed its pm
seymour looks around still hopeful
his date is now ten minutes whats he doing now
hes still just sitting there
god this is totally unbearable
i wish i could see him
go ahead and look but dont make it too obvious
rebecca turns around and pretends to look past seymour
its now pm
his date is minutes late
seymour gets up and walks sadly towards the cashier weird al
do you think he knows
they watch him leave
enid goes up to pay the bill while josh and rebecca go outside
hey weird al did that guy say anything to you before he left
not a thing
enid goes back to the table to leave a tip two dollars
al passes behind her
cheerfully professional despite her abuse thank you and come again
enid hesitates overcome with guilt
she glances back at al then digs every penny out of her pocket about seven dollars in coins and wadded up bills and adds it to his tip
the trio drive in silence
suddenly an extra wide pick up vrooms past josh cutting off the driver seymour next to him
seymour bobs violently as he screams silent obscenities
jesus look at this guy
oh my god thats him
are you sure
angle on seymour really having a fit now
once its out of his system he reverts to an amiable poker face
we should follow him home
come on josh
dont you want to see where he lives
but this guy is like a one of kind rare butterfly and we have to follow him back to his natural habitat
you need counseling
several minutes have passed
god he lives right in our neighborhood
seymour gets out and disappears up the steps of his building
he doesnt even look that bummed out really
wouldnt you be totally pissed off
this kind of thing must happen to him all the time
full screen grainy b w video footage
the camera travels up a shadowy flight of stairs
we hear footsteps a rhythmic pounding and a deranged childrens choir lalalalalala
cheap echo effect returning to the house of my fatherfatherfatherfather
the camera reaches the top of the stairs we see a door that slowly creaks open
we move into the room beyond its decorated with stuff from the s and a giant crucifix
we hear a televangelists sermon
we move close on a little girls doll
very slowly a mans hand reaches for the doll and drags it into the shadows
the hand throws the now mutilated doll into a toilet water and blood swirl around
we see grainy footage shot off of tv of christians angrily picketing an abortion clinic
credits come up the end
a the lights go on the video ends and the monitor is shut off
there are about a dozen students mostly pimply year old boys a few ish girls and enid dressed in schoolgirl outfit
the teacher roberta allsworth addresses the class
that piece is entitled mirror father mirror
i like to show it to people im meeting for the first time because it says so much about who i am and what it feels like to inhabit my
and this is exactly what im hoping to get from each of you over the course of this summer a picture of your own self exploration
my own background is in video and performance art but im hoping that doesnt influence you and that youll find your own ways of externalizing the internal
at the end of the summer this class has been invited along with several others in the area to participate in a show of high school art at the neighborhood
the title of the show will be brotherhood and community art as dialogue
i think the brotherhood theme ties in nicely with the theme of self discovery that id like to emphasize in this class
are there any questions so far
shes completely lost them great
enid and rebecca stand in front of seymours apartment
this is way too creepy
he wont see us
well just stalk him from a distance
im afraid if i see him ill start feeling really bad again
so what should we do
we cant just hide all day waiting for him to come out
there are three mail slots
enid pulls the mail out of the first one
we see flower bulb catalogues and ladies home this is girl mail
she grabs the mail out of slot number two
this is all computer catalogues and stuff
rebecca is looking at the mail from slot number three
fields fan club newsletter
she flips through the mail oh my god the national psoriasis foundation
she shoves back the contents of slot number two and grabs the mail from rebecca
we hear male voices around the corner
do you hear that
enid jams the mail back in the slot in a panic
they slowly walk around the bushes toward the voices
they see the garage sale in progress
theyve all spotted each other
what should we do
what if he recognizes us
come on its too late now
a middle aged housewife browses with little enthusiasm as enid rebecca tentatively approach
enid spots a mongoose vs
cobra taxidermy piece near joe
ew look at this
i think its cute look at his little weasel teeth
ew its like some gross rat
hardly looking up from tv its a mongoose
they eat snakes
you never heard of a mongoose
thats a classic piece of vintage taxidermy
nobody alive today knows how to do work like that
looking underneath it how much is this
thats not officially for sale
i might have to hang onto that for the time being
joe shuts off the tv
he turns to the girls not wanting to lose the rapport hes established with two potential customers
so are you looking for anything in particular
theres a lot of other stuff in storage
he picks up a plastic casio type guitar keyboard a childs toy and starts noodling pre programmed rock licks
perhaps the jam in ator appeals to you
absolutely no practice necessary
you shread like a giant
just press a button
she notices several modern jazz lps on joes table
do you have any other old records besides these
hes the man with the records
enid glances at rebecca and mouths the implausible name seymour
rebecca snorts unable to control her laughter and turns away from the table
enid keeps her cool
do you have any old indian records
you know like weird s indian rock n roll music
i dont have anything after about
i may have one hindu from the twenties in my collection but its not really for sale
i dont really collect foreign
enid drifts over and begins thumbing through a box of s
those are all s
can you play s
wait maybe not s but i can play regular records
he points her to a nearby box of lps
theres some good stuff in here
do you like old music
sure i guess
well theres a few choice lps in here that re issue some really great old blues stuff
rebecca tugs on enids sleeve
enid gets free and continues looking through the records
she stops on one with an especially wacky cover
is this one any good
nah its not so great
heres the one id recommend
he pulls out a bland looking record collectors items volume three
rebecca shifts impatiently behind her
this track alone by memphis minnie is worth about if you have the original
she was one of the greatest guitar players that ever lived and a great singer and songwriter as well
i know the guy who owns the original and lent it for use on this reissue
rebecca snorts at enids over exuberance
enid kicks her
how much is it
a dollar seventy five
she pays him
if you dont like it bring it back for a refund
were here every saturday
he puts the record into a bag
im sure its fine
enid rebecca sit in their usual booth
rebecca is reading that was truly pathetic
i still cant get over that his name was seymour
rebecca starts looking through the apartment listings
she takes a pen out of her purse
he was so excited when you bought that record youre a saint
god these apartments are super expensive
it was so cute how he had his own little bags
i thought i was going to start crying
do you think theyre gay
what about the striking redhead in the yellow dress
he should totally just kill himself
hey heres one circles it oh wait
crosses it out you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats
i kind of like him
hes the exact opposite of everything i really hate
in a way hes such a clueless dork that hes almost cool
that guy is many things but he definitely isnt cool
this one would be okay but theres no kitchen
you know what i mean
forget it i cant explain it
oh my god what are you guys doing here
what are you doing here melorra
my acting workshop is across the street from here
im just on my break
well we wont keep you
i love this place
its so you know funky
enid and rebecca look at each other
what are you guys up to
were looking for an apartment
god how cool
where are you moving
were not sure yet thats why were looking
god thats so exciting
looks at clock oops i should go
bye you guys
melorra leaves quickly
what is she black now
they watch her cross the street shes dressed in expensive casual clothes with a fancy backpack
ive been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that were like these totally rich yuppies
what are you talking about
thats who people want to rent to
its a known fact that its way easier to get a job and everything if youre rich
all we have to do is buy a few semi expensive outfits and act like its no big deal
itll be fun
you just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you
just promise youll do it
okay okay i promise
jesus youre out of your mind
loud water running punk rock blares from adjoining bedroom as enid her head in the sink sings along making up her own words
as she straightens into frame we see that shes dyed her hair green
she grabs a towel and heads into the bedroom
her dad enters with a mixing bowl oblivious to the green hair and loud music
over music have you seen my blue spatula
what are you making pancakes
not if i dont find that goddamn spatula
enid messes up her hair in different ways while singing along to the tape and looking at herself in the mirror
rebecca opens the door and stands in the doorway
disdainful when did you do that
enid turns around startled but instantly regains helps composure
how long have you been standing there
did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade
fuck you bitch
they walk past a sad looking acme shoes and repair store in a distinctive old building that looks as if its been there forever
they stop and peer through the window
we still have to go in there sometime
its always closed
i bet they have tons of incredible shoes hidden in the back
they continue walking
hey look its the pants
we see a pair of discarded jeans on the sidewalk
where are we going
lets go hassle josh
they see a middle aged man dressed in a shabby threadbare suit and hat sitting at what was once a bus stop
the rusty sign has a red sticker on it that says no longer in service
there he is
waiting for the bus that never comes
i wonder if hes just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or why dont you ask him
enid sits next to the man
rebecca stands behind the bench taken aback that enid is going to end the long standing speculation
whats your name
looks at watchless wrist then down the street norman
are you waiting for a bus
i hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago
there are no buses on this street
you dont know what youre talking about
enid rebecca are on the outside porch walkway on the second floor of joshs building
enid pounds on his pasteboard door the windows rattle with each hollow thud
hes probably in there jerking off
ill bet he never jerks off
yeah hes beyond human stuff like that
should we leave a note
enid finds a piece of paper the back of a pizza flyer
do you have a pen
she writes while rebecca looks over her shoulder
we came by to fuck you but you didnt answer the door
therefore you are gay
signed tiffany and amber
youre not really going to leave that are you
enid pushes the note over his doorknob
why are we going here
i hate this place
itll only take a second
we see racks of books with titles like make explosives at home
rebecca walks over to the magazine rack
im telling you youre wrong carpet beetles are the only way to get the flesh off a corpse
boiling is strictly for amateurs
dont you creeps ever talk about anything nice
dont you ever talk about fluffy kittens or the easter bunny
look whos talking little miss badass
yeah nice outfit who are you supposed to be cyndi lauper
blow me doofus
john ellis emerges from the back and begins to unload a box of books onto the shelves
he stops and looks at enid
didnt they tell you
tell me what
punk rock is over
i know its over asshole i if you really want to fuck up the system you should go to business school thats what im gonna do get a job at
some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside
thats not even yeah yeah yeah
do you have my money
she wads up a twenty dollar bill and throws it at him
oh how punk
that tape sucked by the way
im so sorry if you were offended
he heads toward the back room with the empty box
go die asshole
get a job
rebecca walks over to enid
what was that all about
its not like im some modern punk dickhead
its obviously supposed to be a punk look but i guess johnny fuckface is too stupid to get it
i didnt get it either
everybodys too stupid
enid dejectedly enters and heads straight for the bathroom
she rummages through a cabinet until she finds the right box black hair dye
she wets her hair then goes into the bedroom and mechanically turns on her boom box
the punk rock song we heard earlier plays
she yanks out the tape and flings it away
she skims through her records and cds dismissing them all
she notices seymours bag in the corner
she takes out the record and puts it on
the first tune is an upbeat instrumental number
she returns to the bathroom
several minutes pass
track two begins on the lp
she and we slowly begin to take notice
its a strange haunting old blues record
we see that the tune has struck a nerve
the song continues
enid sits in her bean bag chair
her hair is now dyed back to black
as the song ends she picks up the needle and starts it again
yeah it took a while before i got a chance to play it but when i heard that song it was like so you really liked it
yeah theres some really rare performances
you liked that memphis minnie huh
yeah thats good too
the whole record was good but that one song devil got my woman i mostly just keep playing that one over and over
do you have any other records like that
the skip james record
yeah thats a masterpiece
there are no other records like that
i actually have the original of it in my collection
its one of maybe five known copies
nearly sincere wow
do you want to see it
i can run upstairs and get it
yeah sure i guess
to joe he always says this when he leaves his table watch my stuff
an uncomfortable pause as enid stands at the table
she touches the mongooses tooth
not looking up you still interested in that
i thought it wasnt for sale
im thinkin maybe i could let it go
its kind of falling apart
seymour returns with the holding it like a precious object
here it is
its only about v minus and has an incipient lam crack but plays decent as i recall
seymour passes the to enid who follows suit and holds it carefully by the edges
enid pretends to drop the record
i dropped it
hey i was only kidding
she hands the record back to seymour whos shaken and embarrassed
are you all right
starts with a pan across a wall of unimpressive high school art dumb drawings of fighting chuck norris types traced centerfolds highly sexualized horses etc
and on a table a wire sculpture made from two coathangers
im not going to start a discourse on the subject of good art vs
bad art these judgments are for each person to make on his own
i merely want to help each of you find the best way to look within yourselves the best key to your particular lock
last week i asked you to try and create a piece of artwork that responds to something that you have strong feelings about
enid enters late and puts her sketchbook on the table
and it looks like we have some really interesting work up here
roberta peruses some of the art then points to a very violent drawing
what can you tell us about your piece
struggles to read signature phillip
very stupid and nervous uh
its about the mutilator
its this really great video game about a guy who kills people with a big hammer
trying to make a joke i thought maybe this was supposed to be your father
no response from phillip
roberta nicks up enids sketchbook and leafs through it
and what can you tell us about this
searches for name enid
its sort of like a diary i guess
we see several sketches including the drawing of the satanists
roberta shows a few pages to the class
i think that phillip and enid can help us to see that there are many different ways we can express ourselves
we can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and
that deals with issues emotional spiritual political of great importance
i hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class
pause points at who is responsible for this
talk to us about it
its my response to the issue of a womans right to choose
its something i feel super strongly about
isnt this a wonderful piece class
this definitely falls into that higher category of art i was speaking of earlier
margaret glances over at enid
enid gives her a dirty look
on a monitor a generic trailer is playing
hello and welcome to masterpiece video
how may i help you this afternoon sir
im looking for a copy of
is it a new release sir
no its the classic italian film
let me look that up on the computer for you sir
yes here it is weeks with mickey rourke
its in our erotic dramas section
no not the fellini film
ill check that for you sir
how do you spell the actors name f i l e we see enid rebecca dressed up in sexy outfits
how about this one
hey you have to see my new good luck charm
she pulls out a small porcelain figure of a man flushing himself down a toilet with the words goodbye cruel world on the base
when did you get that
this morning at seymours garage sale
god arent you tired of seymour yet
rebecca picks up another tape
how about this
im sure it sucks
all these movies suck
an obnoxious six year old tries to get his parents to add another tape to their already tall stack
he stares at the video monitor
another masterpiece employee reshelves videos near them
overly cheerful hello
how are you young ladies this evening
may i help you find a particular masterpiece movie
they walk by him
lets get out of here this place makes me sick
we have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before i start my stupid job
i know a party we could go to
its a surprise
i dont believe you
if i promise you theres really a party with a lot of guys do you promise youll go
a depressing collectors get together in progress
enid rebecca sit on an old sofa in the corner
nine or ten record collectors mill about
there are some records i will pay serious money for provided theyre a sincere v plus
other than that id prefer to just have them on cd
cds will never have the presence of an original
a digital transfer adequately mastered will sound identical to the original
do you have a decent equalizer
i have a klipsch b
obviously the problem
you expect a ten band equalizer to impart state of the art sound
dream a little dream
enid rebecca are sitting nearby
i totally totally hate you
aw cmon this is a fun party
angle on joe stands talking to gerrold an obnoxious pushy fast talking guy who keeps eyeing rebecca
he shovels food into his mouth as he speaks
so whats the story with the two cheerleaders over here
you gotta be kidding me
dont worry about it
hes not gettin any and neither are you
poking joe in the chest let me tell ya somethin joe
listen to me joe
you cant hit a home run without swinging the bat
gerrold walks over to where rebecca is sitting
he sits on the arm of sofa next to her
mind if i sit here
staring straight ahead yes
whoa that was cold
hey youre okay youre pretty sharp
hey youre wearing a green dress whadda you irish
i bet youre irish
whats your name
melorra listen to me let me tell you something melorra
you seem like an interesting chick what are you doing hanging out with these losers here
whaddya say you and me take off and hit some nightspots etc
ill be right back im gonna go get a beer
to enid wait
enid goes over to the beer keg
nearby seymour stands talking to paul a humorless middle aged guy in a suit and tie whos contemptuously examining one of seymours s
but it plays like new
theres no groove wear
it has an enlarged center hole and a hair crack
enid approaches them
but the crack is so tight its completely inaudible
a tight hair crack is just that a crack
i dont collect cracked records
walking away i only pay a premium for mint records seymour you know that
what was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks
i didnt think you would have any interest in this get together
i mean if you had told me you were coming i would have warned you its not like a real party or anything
youre right about that
pause so this is your record collection
oh god no
this is just junk i have for sale or trade
the record room is off limits
can i see it
yeah well sure
you can if you want to
its just i dont want all these guys in there at once
enid seymour enter his inner sanctum beverage containers in hand nicely displayed old collectibles cover just about every inch of wall space
this is like my dream room
are these all records
i have about fifteen hundred s at this point
ive tried to pare down my collection to the essential
god look at this poster
i cant believe this room
youre the luckiest guy in the world
id kill to have stuff like this
go ahead and kill me
this stuff doesnt make you happy believe me
oh come on
what are you talking about
you think its healthy to obsessively collect things
you cant connect with other people so you fill your life with stuff
im just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers
enid writes her name in the dust
no youre not
youre a cool guy seymour
if im so cool why havent i had a girlfriend in four years
i cant even remember the last time a girl talked to me
im talking to you
ill bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute
i guarantee i could get you a date in like two seconds
im totally serious
i mean it you leave everything to me im going to be your own personal dating service
i appreciate the offer but you really dont mark my words by the end of this summer youll be up to your neck in pussy
thats very nice of you enid but i i really as enid and seymour walk
a ish secretary type passes
what about her
would you go out with her
i dont know what kind of question is that
i mean its totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me
but putting that aside for now would you go out with her
i really didnt get a good look at her
a breasty overweight year old walks by
okay what about this one
are you into girls with big tits
cmon seymour im trying to collect data here
dont you want me to find you your perfect dream girl
im just not one of those guys who has a type
every guy has a type
he doesnt really mean this i mean as long as shes not a complete imbecile and shes even remotely attractive
they walk by the pants
hey look theres norman
hes sitting as before at the defunct bus stop
norman nods politely
seymour looks quizzically at enid
theyre in another part of town near the sidewinder
we need to narrow this down somehow
we need to find a place where you can meet women who share your interests
maybe i dont want to meet someone who shares my interests
i hate my interests
where can i go to meet the exact opposite of myself
yeah yeah yeah
just tell me your five main interests in order of importance
sighs well lets see
i guess id have to put traditional jazz blues and ragtime music at the top of the list then probably
lets just say music that way you only use up one
spots the sidewinder wait we have to go in here for a second
josh has his back to the counter as he makes a complicated frozen yogurt sundae for a little girl
without turning around hi
i just stopped in to say hi
he turns around non chalantly holding the sundae
he looks up and sees enid with the guy from wowsville seymour
this is my friend seymour
josh is startled and drops the sundae
the girl starts crying
josh immediately starts to clean up the mess
enid satisfied heads with seymour for the door
see you later josh
as the door closes we hear a familiar voice
enid seymour continue walking
pause so is that your boyfriend
hes nobodys boyfriend
hes just this guy that becky and i like to torture
well are interrupts suddenly oh my god
we have to go in here
they are in front of stans a porno shop
becky and i have been dying to go in here but we cant get any boys to take us
i id really rather not
well just go in for one minute itll be a riot
i dont think so
we have to
i really dont think its a good idea
fine ill go by myself then
enid seymour enter
there are a half dozen men browsing through the videos and magazines
look at all these creeps
enid runs over and grabs a blow up sex doll
everyone in the store looks at them
seymour blushes and sweats
what kind of weirdo would actually have sex with this
we have to buy this
she looks around over stimulated
god this place is a total riot
she picks up a magazine
look at this lollipop lolitas isnt child pornography totally illegal
these are older women just dressed up to look young
angle on a pair of thigh high leather fetish boots
oh my god
wider angle shes in another part of the store near the how much are these boots
do you have these in size five
thats the only pair of those i have right now
im getting a new order in next week
she spots something and gasps
she yells across the store
oh my god seymour
you have to lend me the money to buy this
everyone looks at seymour as he sheepishly approaches
he takes out his wallet
uh i dont have much money with me right now
cmon seymour please
why dont you come back in two weeks well be having our annual back to school sale
rebecca is at the counter serving a long line of yuppies
we can see a sign next to the counter that reads answer todays trivia question and get a free small coffee
id like a medium latte for here
can i get you a biscotti to go with that
just the latte
enid is next wearing a rubber bondage mask with devil horns
give me all your money bitch
where did you get that
you wont believe it
i went with seymour
feldman is in line behind enid
hes a poodle haired fedora wearing eccentric in a motorized wheelchair golf cart contraption
excuse me i cant read the trivia question
enid is in the way
she reads it to him
where on the human body is the douglas pouch located
feldman grunts and starts to tap away on his powerbook while rebecca rolling her eyes goes to get his coffee
a digital graphic of the female form on his computer screen
with a few keyboard strokes he zeroes in on a schematic of the reproductive system
an area behind the cervix blinks
slightly below the uterus on a female
he takes his coffee and putters towards the door
that guy is totally amazing
he does that every single day
can i get a decaf mocha to go
can i get you a
no i dont want a biscotti with that
yuppie pays and leaves
god how can you stand all these assholes
i dont know
some people are okay but mostly i feel like poisoning everybody
at least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining
hes a total asshole
he doesnt even need that wheelchair hes just totally lazy
no it doesnt
you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos
but those are our people
pause so when are you going to get your job
im working on it
ive got a few leads
its just that right now i have all these projects that take up all my time
i promise ill get a job next week
pause god i cant believe you went to anthonys without me
enid and her dad are eating breakfast
a tv sits on the kitchen counter behind them
sincere hope comes in all forms
to the endangered white stork searching for wetlands it comes in the form of a sanctuary provided by people who care
do people care
thats why at chevron were just as concerned
are you still looking for a job
do you have any leads
will you get off my back for once
its tough to find a good job without any kind of training
look i told you im not going to college
well i think its good to keep all your options open
you can always enroll for the winter quarter
you could even live here and go to the city college part time and still get a job if you wanted to
look at me im not even listening to a word youre saying
did i tell you who i ran into at the bagel place
reading cereal box who
how should i know
someone from the past
not the maxine
god how horrifying
enid and rebecca sit in a semi crowded college hang out
you dont have to make a million dollars just get any stupid job so we can at least start looking for an apartment
thoughtful pause i wonder if i hang around with you because youre like my surrogate mother figure or something
like i have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly
you hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you
did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos
maybe thats why we spend so much time together
pause see that guy
he gives me a total boner
hes like the biggest idiot of all time
the guy a college sophomore walks by them with two friends
are you guys up for some reggae tonight
okay youre right
whispers heads up
an earnest alternative rock guy approaches rebecca
he hands her a flyer
hey my band is playing here on friday night and uh
theres gonna be a bunch of cool bands playing and stuff and you dont have to pay if you show this flyer at the door
you should come check it out
she looks away enid takes the flyer from rebecca
there are a bunch of bands listed
which one is your band
embarrassing pause then to rebecca yeah well
maybe ill see you there
pause walks away what a dork
youre just jealous
believe me at this point im over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me
face it you hate every single boy on the face of the earth
thats not true i just hate all these obnoxious extroverted pseudo bohemian losers
sad pause sometimes i think i act so weird because im crazy from sexual frustration
havent you heard about the miracle of masturbation
sighs maybe we should be lesbos
get away from me
starts on full moon in night sky framed right a dark moonlit room
enid lies on her stomach in bed
we move in closer to her head as though entering her thoughts which slowly fade in we move toward a vertical sliver of light a cracked open bathroom door
we move into the bathroom and see enid taking a shower
josh enters dressed in a black suit holding a large bouquet of flowers
we start again exactly as before only without the flowers
he starts to take off his clothes
he enters again and gets right in the shower fully clothed
they begin to kiss
after a passionate moment the door opens
rebecca stands there stunned
we see only the slightest trace of enid in the darkness
close up on a charcoal portrait of don knotts
who is this enid
its supposed to be don knotts
and what was your reason for choosing him as your subject
i just like don knotts
she moves on
what do we have here margaret
its a tampon in a teacup
i can see that
now what can you tell us about it
first of all what kind of sculpture is this
its a found object
thats when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art
now what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent
i guess i see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood because of tea parties in the olden days but instead of tea i was trying to kind of confront
people with this
this shocking image of repressed femininity
i think its really a wonderful piece margaret
enid gives margaret another dirty look
this illustrates perfectly what i was saying about not being afraid to use controversial imagery class
enid plays with the radio stopping on an obnoxious am disc jockey
kfto comin atchya on this beautiful evening
god that assholes voice is so hateful
no wonder i never listen to the radio
shutting it off relax seymour relax
that thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud its like someone jabbing me in the face
imitating insincere dj voice kfto comin atchya on this beautiful evening
she changes the subject and holds up a record
so why did you bring this along
i brought it for him to autograph
hes going to be amazed to see it its one of two known copies
i cant believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner
what an insult
this bars going to be packed with girls for you to pick from
im not holding my breath in that department
seymour waits at a stop sign for two oblivious overweight women each with toddlers and baby carriages to cross
what are we in slow motion here
what are ya hypnotized
have some more kids why dont you
for christs sake would you move
a marquee reads tonite blueshammer also fred chatman fred chatman age plays an acoustic blues number
hes good but hes being politely ignored for the most part by the twenty something patrons
most of them are more interested in a baseball game showing on a big screen tv
i cant believe these people
they could at least turn off their stupid sports game until hes done playing
fred finishes to polite applause
takes the mic
lets hear it for fred chatman
a little more applause hey dont go away because weve got blueshammer coming up in just a minute
a cute girl mid s stands near their table sipping her drink
enid nods in her direction for seymours benefit as if to say check it out
yes that would certainly do
well offer her a seat
you want me to do it
wait a minute
jesus i gotta think of something to talk to her about
just wait here
enid gets up before seymour can stop her and talks to cute girl who looks back at seymour and smiles
she goes to join him
enid walks off in the direction of the bar giving seymour a thumbs up
that was great music huh
sitting down yeah i just love blues
actually technically what he was mostly playing would more accurately be classified in the ragtime idiom
although of course not in the strictest sense of the more classical ragtime piano music like that of scott joplin or joseph lamb
authentic blues has a more conventional twelve bar structure in its stanzas
oh if you like authentic blues youve just gotta see blueshammer
theyre so great
angle on enid standing alone at the bar
we see seymour and cute girl from her pov
her gaze drifts to the other people in the bar
we move over the faces of all the guys and stop on a skinny introverted looking guy with a pool cue
he makes a shot and instantly goes into an ostentatious cue twirling routine
her gaze drifts on
she sees herself in a mirror behind the bar and takes off her hat reconfiguring her hair
she reaches into her purse and puts on a bulkier pair of glasses
this is interrupted by blueshammer taking the stage
young white cocky pretty boys
all right people
are you ready to boogie
cuz we gwine play you some authentic way down in the delta blues to rock your world
one two three
a din of loud noise
cute girl immediately leaps to her feet boogeying to the music
several horny alpha males press in on seymour whos still sitting spilling his drink as they vie to dance with her
seymour extricates himself from the table and walks toward the bar where enid sits
what did you tell that girl
i told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label
now i remember why i havent gone anywhere in months
im not even in the same universe as those creatures back there
i might as well be from another planet
we just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isnt a total idiot thats all
look i really appreciate your help enid but lets face it this is hopeless
its not hopeless
yeah well its simple for everybody else give em a big mac and a pair of nikes and theyre happy
i just cant relate to
yeah well i cant relate to humanity either but i dont think its totally hopeless
but its not totally hopeless for you
ive had it
i dont even have the energy to try anymore
you should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything i do so you dont end up like me
id rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar
at least youre an interesting person
at least youre not exactly like everybody else
hooray for me
enid walks in behind seymour
im not sure i have anything to drink
there might be some it doesnt matter im not staying long
i just want to make sure i convince you not to give up yet
they both have drinks now
he puts on a jazz record an instrumental
picks up an antique knick knack wow this is so cool
if you dont mind my asking why do you care so much if i get a date or not
because i cant stand the idea of a world where a guy like you cant get a date
enid finds a painting leaning in a pile of stuff against the wall in the corner
its an old fashioned cartoony stereotype of a black mans head with big lips and a huge toothy smile
what the fuck seymour
what is this
i borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago
i guess its mine now
what are you a klansman or something
yeah right im a klansman thanks a lot
do you know the cooks chicken franchise
quoting tv commercial in deep voice four piece cooks special deep fried with side n slaw its out ray geous
yeah well cooks is just a made up name
when they originally opened back in they were named the coon chicken inn thats an early painting of their first logo
he takes out a scrapbook
im obsessed with all this stuff this lost culture of the th century
she looks through the scrapbook we see the coon chicken logo transform first into a less stereotyped black man then into an older distinguished black chef with the logo cooks
then to a white version of the same chef followed by a female white chef then to a streamlined s version
on another page is a collection of cosmetic labels tracing the design evolution of a different company
why doesnt everybody know this
the record ends
seymour gets up to take it off the turntable
somewhat bitterly its ancient history
the same reason nobody knows about this lionel belasco record
he puts on another record
actually i was a whole lot more interested in the cooks phenomenon when i was about your age
ive kind of lost interest since ive been working for them
you work at cooks chicken
for nineteen years
what are you a fry cook or something
nothing so glamorous
actually im an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters
jesus id go nuts if i had to work in an office all day
hey i get good benefits a good early retirement plan nobody ever bothers me
yeah but still
i make enough money to eat and buy old records
what more do i want
enid puts down the scrapbook stares at the painting
so i dont really get it are you saying that things were better back then points at painting even though there was stuff like this
no in a lot of ways things are better now
everybody still hates each other but they know how to hide it better or something
suddenly hey can i borrow this
i promise ill take good care of it
theyre very sensitive at work about all this stuff
maybe it would be better if you dont you trust me seymour
we see another wall of student art dominated this time by enids seymours x painting
lets address some discussion to this piece
i dont like it
can you tell us why
i dont know
i think its totally weak
yeah its not right
more kids respond at once
even margaret is confused
these are all valid comments but i think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this
well i got the idea when i was doing some research and i discovered that cooks chicken used to be called coons chicken and so i decided to do my
project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism
and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture
did you actually do this painting
well no its more like a found art object
and how do you think this addresses the subject of racism
i guess im trying to show how racism used to more out in the open and now its hidden or something
and how does an image like this help us to see that
im not sure
thinks i guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why its so shocking
a long pause as roberta and the class stare at the painting
i dont really know what to say enid
another over long pause its a remarkable achievement
enid is lying on her back with her head on rebeccas stomach
both stare blankly at the ceiling
are you kidding
its a dream job
i cant believe you got a job like that without even trying
god i wish that was my job
trying to generate some enthusiasm yeah maybe itll be okay
at least ill get to see every movie for free i guess
i had to lie and tell them i already graduated
when are you finally going to get your diploma
i dunno but next week is my last class
anyway now we can start looking for the apartment
waits for some response from enid but there is none do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment
wasnt it like eighth grade
you wanted to move out right then
that must have been when my dad was married to maxine
i remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick daniel dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him
we were such desperate sluts back then
enid is behind the candy counter dressed in a brown and orange uniform
im gonna let you handle the four thirty crowd by yourself that way i can evaluate your performance while its slow and ease you into the bigger crowds
you can count on me sir
a customer an alcoholic loser approaches the candy counter
do you serve beer or any alcohol
actually you wish
after about five minutes of this movie youll wish to god you had about ten beers
loser stares blankly hesitates then goes into theater
pulling her aside what are you doing
you dont ever criticize the feature
what difference does it make
you already got his money
look thats the policy
if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater
but i was only trying to be friendly
look we dont pay you to be a movie critic just do your job
i wont say a word
another angle an hour has gone by
thats three dollars
let me have plenty of butter on that
making a face here you go smothered in delicious yellow chemical sludge
pulling her aside what the hell is wrong with you
im just kidding around with the customers
its my shtick
well lose it
and why arent you pushing the large sizes
didnt you get training about upsizing
but i feel weird
its so sleazy
its not optional
can i get a medium sprite
a medium sprite
why sir do you not know that for a mere twenty five cents more you could purchase a large beverage that has a volume of over twice that of a
puny medium drink
she gives manager a look im only telling you this because were such good friends medium is strictly for suckers who dont understand the concept of value
rebecca is behind the counter glaring at enid
what are you talking about
what kind of loser gets fired after one day
i told you my manager was a total asshole
dont worry im going to get another job
and anyway i have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime
an angry customer returns with her drink
im not at all happy with this latte what do you intend to do about it
its the next day
enid has set up a garage sale in front of her apartment building
this is it
i cant believe youre selling some of this stuff
everything must go
oh my god i remember this hat
this was during your little old lady phase
a trendy young hipster happens along and looks through the clothes then to the table where he picks up a ridiculous looking stuffed animal
how much is this
thats not for sale
noticing price tag wait it says five dollars
oh thats a mistake i decided not to sell it
the hipster looks around a little more and then leaves
what was that all about
i thought everything must go
oh yeah right like im gonna let some asshole with a goatee own goofy gus
a couple is browsing
the girl a severely skinny clubhopper type in platform shoes looks at the clothes the boy a long haired skateboarder goes through her records
how much is this dress
oh my god youre selling that
long pause thats five hundred dollars
youre crazy it should be like two dollars
i was wearing that dress the day i lost my virginity
well why do i care about that
why do you even want it
it would look stupid on you
god fuck you
enid turns to the boy hes holding some records and a book
put that stuff back its not for sale
what is this
some fuckin joke
they stomp off
now are you going to get a regular job
defeated quiet dont worry
if it makes you feel any better i dont think you couldve gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff
twenty minutes later
most of the stuff is gone
enid packs up one last box to carry inside
do you want to do something tonight
i cant its seymours birthday
what time is it
i have to go to the store
i was going to make him a cake
miffed sighs well are we still going shopping tomorrow
yeah i guess
she heads toward the stairs with the box
rebecca watches her go
since when can you make a cake
enid presents seymour with a hostess cupcake with a single lit candle in the center
the lights are off
you can open your eyes now
uh thanks a lot enid
i really appreciate it
blow it out
he leans forward and blows out the candle then abruptly straightens up and holds the small of his back in pain
enid turns the lights back on
are you okay
its just my stupid back
ill be all right in a minute
she notices him adjust something under his shirt
what is that
its just this elastic thing i have to wear for lumbar support
what like a girdle
maybe now you understand why i cant get a date
yeah well youre not the only one
everybody i know has totally fucked up problems
it seems like only stupid people have good relationships
sarcastically cheering her on thats the spirit
i mean im eighteen years old and ive never even had a real steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks
im starting to think that even if i did get a girlfriend it really wouldnt change anything
its not like it makes all your problems go away
then again thats easy for me to say since ill never even get a date
im sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you
actually ive got a total crush on this one guy right now but its a really fucked up situation
oh wait you met him
remember that guy josh
im like practically obsessed with him but i cant do anything about it because becky would freak out
never mind its way too complicated
pause did you have problems like this when you were my age where youre totally confused all the time
i wont even dignify that with a response
he gets up and looks through his shelves for a record
looking at his records i wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them
a sore subject who knows
the phone rings
seymour ignores it
arent you going to get that
let the machine get it
i have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me
after several more rings the machine picks up and we hear seymours message
after the beep theres a long fumbling pause
i knew it
its my mother
im calling for
you placed an ad in the weekly over a month ago and
well im the redhead in the yellow dress
at least i think i am
i saw the ad when you first placed it but i was in this relationship at the time so i cut it out and now im not in the relationship
giggles god this is really confusing
anyway if you still want to talk to me i can be reached at kl thats my work number and my name is dana
feigning ignorance what was that all about
its just somebodys idea of a joke
that didnt sound like a joke to me
what did you write a personal ad or something
still confused uh yeah
a long time ago
she called before once
its just somebody trying to humiliate me
i promise you that wasnt a joke you have to call her back
how can you be so sure
im an expert about stuff like this she was totally for real
enid enters a light is on in the kitchen
could you come in here for a minute
she walks slowly to the kitchen a suspenseful moment
she sees first her dad wearing an apron and then a hauntingly familiar middle aged woman
pumpkin do you remember maxine
to dad look im kind of tired i think ill go to bed
i made spaghetti
do you want some
i i really have to get up early for class tomorrow
its really quite something to see you all grown up like this enid
no response from enid id love to hear about what youre doing
i cant help but feel that i had some small part in how you turned out
another silent pause what are you studying
you were always such a smart little girl
im taking a remedial high school art class for fuck ups and retards
a toothy zit covered year old boy poses with a very poorly made sculpture
a flash goes off and he jumps slightly sending pieces of his sculpture flying
its roberta taking photos
she moves on to enid in front of her big painting
enid ad libs a weird expression as
the flash goes off
roberta now turns to address the class
im going to miss you people
i feel that weve all done a lot of growing this summer
i hope that each of you feels as though youll be taking away something from this experience i know i certainly will be
a long poignant pause as she smiles admiringly at them
remember the art show is this saturday at seven thirty sharp
try to get there at least minutes early
the students get their things together and file out
enid can i talk to you for a minute
dont worry its nothing bad
i was just wondering what your plans were for next year
im not really sure working i guess
well i know this is really short notice but i got a call from a very close friend at the academy of art design and she tells me that im
allowed to place one student from your graduating class in a one year scholarship program
and well i hope you dont mind enid but i took the liberty of submitting your name
she gives her a booklet and an application form
as far as i know it includes housing and meals and everything
it is really quite an offer
pause so what do you think
would i have to take classes and stuff
let me know as soon as you can enid
this could be a great thing for you
enid rebecca are in a crate barrel type store looking at housewares
i think one of us should fuck josh
god youre really obsessed
i am not i just think itd be funny to see what hed do
i thought we decided that josh was way too cool to be interested in sex and that hes the only decent person left in the world and we would never
want to bring him down to our level and all that
yeah but maybe one of us should at least try
no matter what happened it would be a big disaster
lets just try and keep everything the way it is
rebecca spots some particularly fetching dishware
look we have to get these
i cant afford stuff like this right now
im sick of waiting we need to start getting stuff if were ever going to move
pause sees towels arent these the greatest towels
why do you care about this kind of stuff
dont you want nice stuff
i cant imagine spending money on towels
you dont have to
ill pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job
do you still want to go to that thing tonight
that guys band is playing tonight
seymours going on his big date tonight and i kind of want to be around when he calls so i can hear how bad it went
god im so sick of seymour
seymour is just finishing the dinner dana has cooked for them at her place
dana is an attractive redhead about
that was great jeez thanks again for cooking all this
oh i love to cook
i guess most women wouldnt invite a man over on the first date but i believe you should trust your instincts
when i talked to you on the phone you just seemed so
i dont know
ready for ice cream
dana heads for the kitchen
seymour gets up to relieve his backache
he walks over to a framed photo on the wall
here we are
its mocha mint from lickety splits
oh isnt that photograph just heart rending
where is this
was it bosnia
pause its so sad the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy
pause a soul funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention
she goes over and turns it up
oh i just love this song
isnt it great
doesnt it make you want to dance
uh well thats okay i dont dance heh heh
dont be silly anyone can dance
here just follow me
watch my feet
no really i she drags him around
hes still holding his ice cream
cmon seymour its all in your mind
just loosen up and feel the music
here put down your bowl of ice cream
she takes his ice cream and puts it on a table
checking his watch hey its nearly nine already were gonna have to leave now if were going to make that movie
oh all right
just let me put a few things away
she shuts off the stereo as he sits and eats his ice cream
im so excited to see this film dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director
did you see his last film the flower that drank the moon
it was simply glorious
i missed that one
but what do i know
i like laurel and hardy movies
i never really cared for those
why does the fat one always have to be so mean to the skinny one
enid is drawing in her sketchbook
she looks impatiently at the phone
time passes its pm
she cant stand it anymore
seymour picks up the phone
dana is in the background getting some ice in the kitchen
hi its me
so what happened
almost whispering actually its kind of still happening
shes over here right now
i think everythings going pretty well
youre kidding me
yeah so i better go its not really the best time to talk
what are you going to like have sex with her on your first date
ill talk to you later
he hangs up
enid is stunned
she calls rebecca
rebecca is sitting on the couch in her pajamas when the phone rings
she picks it up
do you still want to do something tonight
what happened to seymour
still shocked by this i cant believe it he actually scored
so should i come over
actually im just about to go out with some friends
what are you talking about
just some people from work
i dont believe you
yeah well you said you were busy
look id better get going
ill call you tomorrow
rebecca hangs up
clearly shes not going anywhere
enid stands outside joshs door
a tentative pause then she knocks
josh opens the door stunned
enid is wearing an uncharacteristically sexy outfit
can i come in
she goes in and looks around nervously
the note tiffany amber is tacked to the wall
are you the one who left that note
enid sits down on futon sofa
so whats up
he picks up half finished beer and drinks self consciously
i dont know
im totally confused
josh doesnt respond theres another awkward pause
sit over here
he sits tentatively
do you want something to drink
what do you mean why
are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms
well why not
whats so wrong with me
then why do you hate me so much
when did i say i hated you
youve never once said anything even remotely nice to me
you make me nervous
i always feel like youre going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me
thats just the way i am
yeah well its just my stupid way of getting attention
god i practically love you josh
stunned pause then she bravely leans forward and kisses him
he kisses back but she is clearly the aggressor
they get more and more into it
do you have any protection
later post coital on the now unfolded futon
enid lies on her back josh is face down on top of her with his head to the side
enid has a blank disillusioned stare
now hes romantic and sappy you must have known all along how i you know how i felt about you it must be totally obvious
i always used to dream about this
staring ahead why do you have that stupid poster
its the next morning
josh is asleep
enid fully awake and dressed sits on the bed looking at him thoroughly disillusioned
she pulls out a record from his collection and grimaces
she opens a closet door and finds an electric guitar
waking up groggy happily surprised oh hi
why do all guys have to play stupid guitars
its so typical
either theyre into cars or guns or sports or guitars
its so obvious
how long have you been up
i couldnt sleep
i should get going i feel really weird
do you want to go get breakfast somewhere
i dont think we should
look you have to totally promise me you wont tell becky about this
because if you do ill kill you
just take my word for it
if she ever finds out about this ill never hear the end of it
rebecca is dressed in her best apartment hunting outfit
she sits on her bed dialing the phone with the free weekly open on her lap
she circles something with her pen while the phone rings
goddammit bitch where are you
enid lies perfectly still on her bed staring at the ceiling while the phone rings
establish the restaurant
seymour sits alone eating lunch
we see enid approach stealthily from behind
very startled she sits across from him
where have you been
ive been looking all over for you
ive been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you
no actually joe told me you were here
so how come you never call me anymore
i know im sorry
i ive been really busy
yeah ill bet
so hows it going with whats her name
he looks nervously at his watch oh
pretty well surprisingly
so what kind of stuff do you guys do together
is she into old records and stuff
she doesnt dislike any of that stuff
shes trying anyway
actually were supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon
not convinced sounds good
seymour looks again at his watch
we really should get together sometime soon
i ill definitely call you this week what are you trying to get rid of me
no its just that i should get going in a few minutes and arent you even going to ask me how im doing
i im sorry
how i dunno
okay i guess
pause i fucked that guy josh finally
is he your boyfriend now
he wants to be of course
im weighing several offers at the present time
suddenly dana enters
i guess im a little early
pause as the gears whirl uh dana
this is enid
its great to finally meet you
dana sits next to seymour facing enid
looking back and forth between enid and seymour how do you two know each other
im surprised he hasnt mentioned me were old friends
yes were very close
in fact i was standing right next to seymour the first time you called
if not for me he would have never called you back
is that right
seymour begins to stammer some kind of response
look at the time
ive got to run
ill stop by to see you some time seymour
then to dana it was really great to meet you
enid is in her room getting dressed
i have some good news for you pumpkin
sigh what is it now
are you still looking for a job
well maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at computer station
normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience but she thinks she can convince them
tell her to forget it i dont need her help
a homemade banner reads high school art show brotherhood and community art as dialogue
along one wall is all the work from robertas class a collection of eccentric abstract bric a brac and enids large painting
the painting has drawn a small crowd
we see a chain of events beginning with three parents talking to a matronly director curator who in turn seeks out roberta wearing make up and fancy ish clothes for
the first time
im afraid youre simply going to have to take that painting down
several of the parents have complained
i will do no such thing
then you leave me no other choice than to remove it myself
she marches towards it
roberta runs after her
i think we should give the artist a chance to talk to the parents about her intentions with this piece
we should be promoting discussion as a solution not censorship
roberta sees margaret and grabs her
margaret have you seen enid
margaret shrugs no
roberta looks through the crowd
a college age news hack type with a free weekly t shirt snaps a photo of the director removing enids painting
enid dressed as though for a glamorous date stands knocking on seymours door
enid worms her way past his unwelcoming stance
seymour is wearing designer stone washed denim jeans that look ridiculous on him
joe can be seen in the kitchen
im going to this stupid art show and i want you to be my date
theres something i have to show you
i dont know
i dont really think i should
of course you should
cmon im already a million hours late
i better not
pause well forget the art show
lets do something else
i wish i could enid but i really cant right now
i its just that i well when can we do something
its just that well you know dana just got out of a really bad relationship and i dont want to give her the wrong idea
walking by with his sandwich dont mind me ill just be in my room
where did you get those pants
they were a present from dana
and you like them
well you know
what do i know about clothes
ive never been the most fashionable guy its nice to have someone do all the work for me
pause so thats it
you dont ever want to see me again
no of course i do
its just that right now i need to whats her problem anyway
did she actually tell you you couldnt see me
she just doesnt understand how i would know somebody like you
what does she mean by that somebody like me
just someone so young
you must have done something to make her think you like me
i dont think so
does that mean you dont like me
no of course not
looks him in the eye so do you like me seymour
in what way do you mean
in whatever way you think i mean
not sure what to say long pause i dont know
im sorry but danas a very jealous person
i just dont want to screw that up right now
im sure shell dump me soon and we can go back to being friends
i dont think you understand how i really feel about you seymour
what do you mean
dont worry i wont bother you any more
a long shot of enid as she walks home alone
enid rebecca walk down the street
both wear landlord friendly j
where are we
this is a weird neighborhood
its a totally normal average neighborhood
i just mean its weird to me
ive never been anywhere near here in my life
josh says this is a really good neighborhood
when did you see josh
he came into work
what did he say
when was this
i dont know
god dont act so jealous i only talked to him for two minutes
they walk along in conspicuous silence
twenty seven fifty three
do you see it
looks around that must be it
without enthusiasm great
it looks totally normal
whats wrong with it
i said great
oh yeah i can tell you really love it
well what am i supposed to say
i cant wait to live in some depressing shit hole in the middle of nowhere
theres something wrong with every single place we look at
why dont you just come right out and tell me you dont want to move in with me
because youll freak out and act like a total psycho about it
a few passersby stop to watch
youre the psycho
you havent been able to deal with anything since high school ended
youre the one whos still living out some stupid seventh grade fantasy
as she walks away giving her the finger fuck you
have fun living with your dad for the rest of your life
enid is on her bed crying
her jacket and shoes are strewn about the floor
god fuck you too
we see her dad standing outside her bedroom
as he enters he tries to make enough noise so that she notices him before she really embarrasses herself
she stops crying and pretends to be asleep
her back to him doesnt move nothing
dad sits next to her on the bed and puts his hand on her shoulder
if theres something wrong i wish youd tell me about it
enid pulls away from him and sits up on the opposite side of the bed facing away from him its nothing its just some hormonal thing
dont worry about it
ive got some important news to tell you but it can wait till later if youre not feeling
speaking slowly and methodically well
as you know maxine and i have been seeing a lot of each other and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came
back here to live at the end of the summer just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want
enid maintains a poker face for several long seconds before she bursts into tears utterly defeated
enid determined walks down the empty halls
she goes into a room marked art class
roberta is in there with a bearded ex hippy colleague
theyre covering a student in plaster
hi i brought over my application for the art academy
i hope its not too late
roberta absorbed in her plastering glances at enid
just a minute
then realizing who it is
im so sorry about what happened
what do you mean
the whole business with the art show and the newspaper its absolutely huh
didnt principal jaffee call you
i didnt check my messages
oh my goodness
well the whole thing is just ridiculous and as soon as the school board is back in session next fall im going to do everything i can to help you
help me what
well theyre forcing me to give you a non passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition
but dont worry im sure ill be able to get you your diploma in the fall
pause overwhelmed but
can i still get that scholarship to the art academy
im sorry enid you have to be an official high school graduate before i can nominate you
i had to give it to someone else
but im sure next year i can the plaster covered student makes an uncomfortable moaning noise
flustered to roberta hey can you help me out over here
enid walks the streets its dark out now
she goes by the cafe its closed for remodeling
she continues walking until shes across the street from normans bus stop
she sees him there as always
suddenly a bus well lit from the inside and completely empty pulls up to the stop and norman gets on
a knock on the door seymour shuffles out in t shirt pants and goofy slippers
he looks through the peephole and sees enid
he opens the door
what are you doing here
i had to see you
can you at least let me in
crying look i just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then ill leave you alone
whats the matter
do you have anything to drink
enid goes to look for herself
i think theres some root beer
what about this
she returns from the kitchen with a giant bottle of champagne
thats danas im supposed to be saving it for our two month anniversary
you better not as she starts opening fuck dana
im sick of dana
she opens it and drinks straight from the bottle
seymours look says oh well im fucked i give up
enid seymour sit on the bed listening to old records and drinking out of the bottle
you need a bigger place this is like a little kids room
i could never move ive got too much stuff
enid notices an extremely ugly modern sculpture in the corner
she goes over and picks it up
where did you get this
dana bought it when we went antique shopping
she said it didnt go with her stuff so she gave it to me
she thought it fit in better with my old time thingamajigs
jesus how can you stand her
seymour takes another slug off the bottle
god shes going to kill me
this bottle is half empty
half empty thats what i like about you seymour youre a natural pessimist
if you expect the worst youre never disappointed
what are you talking about
youre disappointed every minute of your life
im just being realistic
at least youre not like every other stupid guy in the world all they care about are guitars and sports
theyre all such fags
i hate sports
how come in all that time i was trying to get you a date you never asked me out
youre a beautiful young girl
i cant imagine you would ever have had any interest in me except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity
yeah but still
its kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that
of course i
why wouldnt i want to go out with you
i always feel like everybody secretly hates me
im just paranoid i guess
i mean you like me dont you
were good friends right
contemplative pause maybe i should just move in here with you
i could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until i get a job
what about joe
says her name with whiny disdainful voice you were a lot more fun before you met dana
youve been acting way too normal lately
youre a bitter twisted fucked up guy seymour thats why i like you
more drunk than before yeah well i like you too
the bottle is empty
you know what my number one fantasy used to be
i used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place
do you ever think about stuff like that
i guess i probably used to when i was your age
it would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it and id just disappear and theyd never see me again
sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems
you know what we should do
lets go get in your car right now and just take off
we could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life
i dont think im in any condition to drive
ill drive then well go out in a blaze of glory
so where would we go
lets just go
whats stopping us
i dunno i
im just so sick of everybody
why cant i just do whatever i want
what do you want
what do you want
whats the matter with you seymour
dont you like me
be a man for once in your life
she kisses him passionately
hes shocked but kisses back
this escalates leading to the sex act shown with merciful brevity
we see enid seymour post coital
god danas going to kill you
do you really want us to drive away somewhere
i will if you want to
embarrassingly sappy i i never expected anything like this to happen
you must know i always
did you really mean all that about moving in with me
i was just thinking out loud
doesnt want to hurt his feelings i mean youve got this whole thing with dana im not going to let you fuck that up
i really need to get some sleep
enid turns her back to him
we see from reverse angle that shes only pretending to be asleep
she looks troubled as though shes just made a big mistake
seymour puts his arm around her
its the only time weve seen him look relaxed and happy
he kisses her arm and goes to sleep
seymour wakes up
enid is gone
dana is on the phone
a lantern jawed male colleague listens in his head pressed up against hers
into phone its a thirty year fixed at five and a half
seymour nervously enters her workspace
dana is pleasantly surprised she stops her conversation
covering receiver seymour
what are you doing here
oh please dont let me interrupt finish your phone call
were almost done
she continues into phone hi
no its excluded
theyve already paid the earnest money
well let them bring it up if they notice it at the final walk through
right great sounds good
she hangs up and high fives her colleague
they bear hug
im proud of ya
well ill check you guys later
im gonna go start the paperwork
colleague leaves dana turns to seymour
so what brings you down here
i feel that i need to uh theres something i feel i have to say
i uh ive never said this to anyone before believe me ive stayed in horrible relationships for years just so i wouldnt have to do this but i uh
what are you trying to say
its just that i feel like its maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out
dana sits down staring ahead stunned for a moment
suddenly she breaks down sobbing
i i honestly never intended for this to happen
please tell me it isnt that teenager
enid and i were just friends
we feel comfortable around each other
she really likes my old records and
i cant believe this
i thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull this kind of shit on me
she starts crying again
seymour awkwardly tries to comfort her
dana pushes him away violently
you disgusting pig
youre just an overgrown baby who cant deal with a woman your own age
you pathetic weakling
you make me sick
enid is now utterly defeated
the phone rings
she lets the machine pick it up
may i ask what youre doing
i want to know what you think youre doing staying out all night and worrying your father to death
oh yeah like he even noticed
listen young lady
i know you dont like me i dont really care whether you do or not but i will not allow you to treat your father the way you do
we hear seymour on the machine in the background
i really want to talk to you
ive been thinking about what you said about moving in here
i can treat him any way i want to im an adult
leave me alone
seymour finishes his message
enid picks up the phone and dials
i need to talk to you
enid rebecca sit at a table
rebecca is wearing her uniform
im sorry about the other day
i dont know whats wrong with me
i really do want to move in with you
i dont know
i was thinking maybe i should live alone
i decided to rent that place we looked at
im moving in next week
please let me come with you
please please please
i dont know im not sure its a good idea
of course its a good idea
its our plan
but how are you gonna pay rent and everything
you dont even have a job
ill get a job tomorrow i promise
if i dont you can totally tell me to fuck off
enid is putting on her shoes
her dad opens the door slightly and sticks his head in
pumpkin are you in there
are you going to yell at me
yeah i heard about that
i was in a horrible mood tell her not to worry ill be completely out of her life in a few days
she understands what youre going through and she really wants to help you
she says that job at computer station is still available if you want it
i im not sure
actually i was just checking to see if you were here your friend seymour is on his way up
what do you mean on his way up
i just buzzed him in
just then three sharp knocks on the front door
whats wrong with you
tell him im not here
but i cant dad goes to answer the door
enid hides in her room
im not sure when shell be back
enid looks out the window and sees seymour walking away
she has a terribly sad look on her face
seymour sits in dim light dialing an antique candlestick telephone
in the background a peter paul and mary concert plays on the tv
we hear three rings followed by enids answering machine message
he hangs up before it finishes
joe walks by the doorway
well heres where the fun never stops
yeah im really really happy
really having a good time
still torturing yourself over that enid huh
seymour doesnt answer
he looks away
where else am i ever going to find another girl who likes geeshie wiley records
pause she could at least have the decency to call me back
maybe she was just using you to try and get back at some guy
it could be a million things
its wasted time trying to logically figure out the female brain thats for sure
again no answer from seymour he stares off into space
maybe shes got another boyfriend
bummed out wants joe to stop yeah well
thanks for cheering me up
deadpan no problem
seymour looks so miserable that even joe has some compassion for him
look at it this way at least things cant get any worse
seymour is left listening to the record
seymour is at work walking down a carpeted hallway with many doors on both sides
a door opens and a tony robbins ish year old management executive sticks his head out
just the man i want to see
step in here for a minute
have a seat
he plunks down the current issue of the free weekly its open to a page article on page with the headline oh brother
and a photo of the painting being removed
what can you tell me about this seymour
enid is wearing a bright orange computer station t shirt and a yellow vest with a trainee tag
shes looking around at her new home a hopelessly drab characterless apartment
so whaddya think
so wheres all your stuff
enid points to a small box with sketchbook etc
thats all youre bringing
im gonna finish packing tonight
ill bring it over tomorrow sometime
make sure youre here by noon we have tons of stuff to do
i have to show you something else
she drags enid into the kitchen and opens a built in ironing board as though its the most amazing thing shes ever seen
isnt this the greatest
enid is sorting her stuff into boxes
digging through her closet she finds a box that she doesnt recognize
inside are her old childrens records s
she excitedly takes one out and plays it
she folds her clothes while listening to this song which clearly is getting to her
she grabs mechanically for the next thing hanging in her closet
its the uniform from her job at computer station
she folds it puts it in the box then stops staring at the orange fabric
rebecca is nervously arranging and re arranging her stuff
she puts up her gigantic new kitchen wall clock and sets the time to
she goes to the phone and calls enid
the machine picks up and rebecca hangs up
she does another tedious pointless task
shes pissed off and goes to the phone to call again
as it rings theres a knock on the door
relieved she hangs up and goes to answer
as she opens the door whats wrong with you retard its three thirty
its seymour standing there not enid
enids stepmother told me id find her here
shes not at home
they said she was here
what the fuck is she doing
she was supposed to be here three hours ago
uh do you mind if i wait
i really need to talk to her
allows him to step inside but leaves the door open are you sure she wasnt there
maybe she was just hiding from you
why would she be hiding from me
i dont know
where is she then
maybe shes with josh
why would she be with josh
i dont know
what did she tell you
she just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating i thought maybe she was
is she having some secret affair with josh
i have no idea i just want to
why wouldnt she tell me
theres no way
she could never keep that to herself
really i dont know enough about it to
changing subject back to me why did you say she might be hiding from me
did she say anything to you about me
getting revenge on seymour yeah she thinks youre a dork
did she say that
look what do you expect
considering how we met you
what do you mean
on that pathetic fake blind date
what are you talking about
didnt she ever tell you about that
god she really is pathological
what fake blind date
what are you talking about
rebecca goes over and gets enids sketchbook out of the box and flips through it
when she gets to the right page she hands it to seymour
read it and weep
we see a pasted up personal ad beside a drawing of seymour in wowsville
on the facing page we see a drawing of josh with his name surrounded by red hearts
seymours car screeches into the parking lot
he bursts into the store ready for once in his life to make a scene
josh is behind the counter cleaning the slurpee machine with his back to the entrance as seymour storms in
doug is over by the magazine rack reading a dirt bike magazine
i hope you had a good laugh at my expense
josh turns around whats going on
he recognizes seymour
you want to see something funny
ill show you something funny
as he says this he flips over a small display rack of potato chips
then he tries to flip over a big display case in front of the counter but is unable to budge it he keeps trying and gets more and more frustrated
josh runs from behind the counter to stop him before he creates a huge mess
he tries to grab seymour and they get into a ridiculous frantic scuffle
seymour starts yelling
suddenly doug appears and gets seymour in a choke hold with his nunchucks
doug ad libs cop style jargon
josh is freaked out
seymour realizes what a fool he is and starts to cry
the boss comes out of the back room
what going on here
the apartment is dark lit only by a harsh annoying streetlight
rebecca sits on the couch in sweat clothes exasperated
she goes to look out the window
cars with loud radios can be heard driving by
she goes to the phone she checks it and hangs up
she picks it up again one last try
she dials the number and waits
we hear the beep of the answering machine
rebecca hangs up
she gets into a sleeping bag spread out in the center of a cold linoleum floor
she zips the zipper all the way over her head and curls up into a whimpering ball
the dialogue begins in voice over as the title card fades
we slowly fade in to see seymour lying on a pink pastel psychiatrists couch as he speaks to his therapist a handsome well coiffed woman in her late s
i have to admit things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit
so tell me more about this job
what exactly will you be doing
well mostly archival research cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their cd reissues
i cant believe it
remember what i said when we first started this little breakdown might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to you
it doesnt pay very much but i should be able to afford my own place in a few months
do you think thats too soon
im really anxious to get my record collection out of storage
why dont we start with that next week
seymour looks up
she nods toward the large wall clock behind her thirty seconds after five
re gets up and she walks him slowly toward the door
thank you doctor
as she opens the door dont thank me
youre doing all the work
they stand facing each other
do you have a check for me
seymour takes a filled out check from his shirt pocket
in the waiting room we see seymours mother
are you done
did you have a chance to think about what you might want for dinner while you were in there
we can talk about it in the car ma
as they leave seymour looks back and smiles weakly at the doctor
the cafe has been fully remodeled and now resembles wowsville more than the old quality cafe
there are no neighborhood characters anymore only well heeled twenty somethings
we see that rebecca is now a waitress here
she tears off a check and places it in front of a super muscular polo shirted european hipster who is too busy tapping away at his powerbook to notice
she walks toward the end of the counter to total up her receipts
she looks up and sees enid wearing tasteful s style clothes sitting across from her
i almost didnt recognize you i think i need to get glasses youre all blurry
nodding toward muscular hipster youre lucky then you cant see the veins on that guys biceps
actually hes a really nice guy
we see at this point that rebecca enid are no longer friends but there are also no hard feelings evident
do you want anything
maybe an orange juice
rebecca goes to get it
enid looks around bemused and saddened by what the quality cafe has become
hey look what i got
she takes a crumpled envelope from her pocket and pulls out her diploma
it just came yesterday
enid turns around
are you ready to go
for a moment its not clear who hes talking to and then still counting receipts yeah just one second
she finishes takes off her apron and emerges from behind the counter
she kisses josh perfunctorily
to josh did you remember to pay the phone bill
to enid call me sometime
we still have to go to that shoe store sometime
rebecca josh leave
enid is totally alone in the now alien world of the quality cafe
a momentary pause as she calmly stares into her orange juice
we see a small round travel bag at her feet
we see enid walking down the familiar streets of her world
its early evening quiet except for distant street noises
she walks toward the old acme shoes and repair store
it looks the same miraculously preserved until she stands right in front of it
she looks through the partially papered over window and sees workmen inside installing new fixtures a modern counter and several small tables all made from a familiar green plastic
a sign in the window reads coming soon another coffee experience
she continues walking as the sun has set and there is a calm stillness to the city
she turns a corner and is startled by her reflection in a large window made of one way glass
she stops and looks at herself
everything about her looks perfect for once no need to change a thing
she moves closer to the glass and shading her eyes tries to look inside
she continues walking
darkness is just setting in and she has the street all to herself
we see enid at normans bus stop sitting on the bench
she looks at the apartment building across the street
a woman who has just arrived home from work turns on the tv bathing her living room with that eerie blue light
the same thing happens in another window down the street
enid looks down the street
in the distance a bus rounds the corner and heads toward her
from a third story window across the street we see the bus as it arrives and stops blocking enid from view
a moment later it pulls away leaving an empty bench
the camera moves upward farther and farther away as the music swells and the credits roll
the bus disappears over the crest of the bridge
