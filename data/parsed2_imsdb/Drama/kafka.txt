kafka by lem dobbs by lem dobbs the old town is quiet
its very early in the twisted streets of this ancient ghetto
dark corners casting a medieval spell over a modern century oblivious to their romance and mystery
the river is the dividing line
elegant gardens on the opposite bank embracing the monotonous solemnity of the new town tower steeples silhouetted against the sombre sky
an empty motor bus rattles along a deserted street
a gothic bridge links the two halves of the strange city
its half moon arches becoming circles as they meet their reflections in the water
thin mist swirls over the cobblestones above
a few boats in the water
fishermen casting their lines in silence
one or two lights now burning in buildings beyond
in the old town square the great clock on the cathedral strikes six
his eyes filled with terror beads of sweat crawling on his brow
he stands in the middle of a murky courtyard perfectly still
the balconies overlooking on successive floors looming all around him are empty
all is quiet
the mans name is eduard
he dares not move for fear of missing a single sound
and then he hears it
a small noise of movement nearby
he runs alone in the dim light of the deserted morning
running for his life
running on sheer pumping fear long after the verge of collapse
coming out into the light but by no means out of danger he allows himself a brief pause gasping for air just for a moment looking back into the gloom
starting to retreat again even as he does then turning running
he runs on past boarded up houses and shuttered inns strange relics of the middle ages casting frightening shadows
eduard appears suddenly quickly flattens himself back against the large notice board that covers the wall here layers of expressionistic theatre and film posters pasted on it
he breathes painfully in short bursts as silently as he can
he watches the corner hes just come from the ornate archway through which any pursuer must emerge
but then a shadow moves
eduards shoulders tense
his eyes widen
he holds his breath
eduard edges away ever so slowly keeping his unblinking gaze on the archway backing off one arm brushing the notice board as he feels his way along it macabre images
on the posters some torn and incomplete revealing other fragments behind eduards eyes staring constant no noise here at all and a hand
clamps over his face from behind
all of a sudden and out of absolutely nowhere and not a thing he can do about it
but he tries his hands coming up to grip the arm that grasps him an arm of iron
the hand is huge
it covers eduards face almost entirely only one eye gaping bloodshot through the fingers ghastly fingers that just for a second seem almost inhuman perhaps even fingers that seem incompatible
on the same hand a hand covered in scar tissue starting to squeeze as it pulls eduard swiftly away
clacketing incessantly under slightly more agile and refined fingers
beyond these another row of desks
and beyond that another the office workers in their neat suits tapping away
and beyond that another at which one worker scribbles furiously at his figures the next rolls a new sheet into his typewriter the next answers his clanging telephone the next
rifles through the pages of a massive record book the next sits erect in his chair playing his machine like a piano and the last by the window dusty light streaming across him contemplatively taps the end of a pencil onto his desk
this is kafka
a rather tall young man with a kind sensitive face
sensitive perhaps because his eyes ears and nose seem slightly bigger and more inquiring than most and his gaze one of almost unrelenting intensity
hes looking off at something now
a desk not very far from his own
the chair pushed squarely under it
the typewriter covered
kafka is wondering why when his concentration is interrupted
kafka turns to see burgel a creep
the keeper of the files is still waiting for your final summation of the erlanger claim
i gave it to him yesterday
doesnt understand you didnt give it to me no i left it in his office
did you see him
ive never seen him
i dont believe there is a keeper of the files
hes usually in the storage room sorting things out
he cant close the file on a case until he has the concluding report
he has it he just hasnt noticed it yet all right
whos to say he ever will
hes a timid old man and quite careful not to tread on anyones toes in fact im the only one he trusts and he wouldnt even look at a document
if it didnt first come through me
burgel just wont go away
kafka tries to get on with his work
in an organization as efficient as ours if a document once in a great while gets lost it might never be found at all
tiring of this burgel i thought it would be easier as long as i was passing but im the messenger
an error like this damages my credibility
your credibility yes its well known
flushed when i deliver a message the very act of delivering it you might say gives it an official stamp and only in this way are both the sender and
the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all
ill commit that to memory
they stare at each other with mutual antagonism
your position in this firm is not unassailable
he waddles away
has one more look over at the empty desk before returning to his work
the desks make a checkerboard pattern of the huge floor as burgel calculates his path among them
kafka comes up the stairs to the top landing
he knocks on a door
leans a little closer to listen for a moment then goes away back down the stairs
kafka comes through the door that divides the stairs from the hall goes to knock on the door of the first apartment down here
im sorry to disturb you i wonder if you know where my friend eduard is
i cant hear you
youd better come in
kafka comes in tentatively seeing the concierge in a far corner of the cluttered room in bed covers tucked right up to her chin
i didnt want to bother you
well you have
what do you want
pointing upstairs my friend eduard i wonder if youve seen him
he hasnt been in to work i thought he might be ill
the concierge trudges up to the top floor kafka following guiltily
you didnt have to get out of bed i could have taken the key
yes im sure you could
she treats him like dirt
the door unlocks and the two of them come in
kafka goes to open the window curtain
he turns around to see the concierge already poking about in drawers
he ignores her and looks around the room on his own
eduard isnt here
nothing else seems out of place
he wonders instead how he can dissuade the concierge from her unbelievable snooping
well hes not here
the concierge takes a tie from one of the drawers and models it over her own ample chest
do you think you ought to do that
she looks at him indignantly
the manners of a tramp
its my house isnt it
kafka is in another section of the building finding his way through a department hes vaguely unfamiliar with
he searches out a particular person a strikingly beautiful woman with flaming hair and wild eyes
gabriela looks around from a file cabinet
im kafka i work upstairs in accident i know
youre a friend of eduard rabans
why would you suppose so
oh well i thought he once mentioned shuts file cabinet one of you must be mistaken
he follows her to a counter where someone stamps the document she thrusts forward without even glancing at her or it
im sorry but i just wondered brushing past him excuse me i have to copy this for central docketing by
kafka watches her go then notices some smarmy young clerks giggling over what they suppose was a romantic rebuff
burgel sees kafka coming back in toward his desk immediately walks to intersect him
youre late i knew it would happen one day
kafka ignores him utterly leaving burgel standing clutching his files with a sour expression
kafka pauses at eduards desk still untouched then continues on to his own
partitioned off from the rest but commanding a full view of all
through the glass windows the chief clerk a stern looking fellow notices kafka and takes his watch out of his pocket for a look
rings signalling the end of the work day
the office workers clear their desks start to leave
the office workers stream down the stairs that wind around a central elevator shaft the gated elevator grinding upwards at the same time
when kafka reaches the ground floor he passes a pair of senior partners conferring together and does a double take when he hears his name mentioned then sees the two
men shake hands conclusively and turn away
kafka continues walking away himself worried about his future
the office workers pour out of the building all going in different directions
three of them get jammed in the doorway untangle themselves and kafka is the next to emerge
a lively place crowded with chattering smoking arguing students poets painters
kafka joins a group of friends
its clear that this is a regular gathering and from their warm reception considered incomplete without him
this is our friend anna who works with us on the magazine
ive been hearing all about you
dont worry kafka i championed your virtues
id like to hear them
annas new to the city we wouldnt frighten her needlessly
ive lived all my life in this city it frightens me
as it draws me closer into its web
this is an ancient lament
no but do you realize why
it has no present im hoping to live in the old quarter
even the so called new town isnt so new
only the people
people of the future living in buildings of the past
abruptly has anyone seen eduard
my friend eduard from the office ive brought him here lots of times you used to marvel at his travel stories
what dyou mean oh him
hes a perfectly nice person hes never missed a day before
perhaps hes taken up with those traveling players you two were so fond of
no its me who always wanted to run away with them except that that life would be far too hectic for me
im worried about him no ones seen him
havent you ever called in sick and gone roaming about free of responsibility to anyone if only for a day
when you work for a medical firm you cant call in sick
they know malingerers like a dog knows fleas
you work in the insurance department
you have been hearing the sordid side then
be pleased you constantly inspire people to take an interest in your life
i should think its very interesting work
kafka shrugs shyly
my father always said i had no ambition
smoke heavier in the air the coffee house more crowded with strange groups of characters
kafka and his friends preparing to leave
the cabaret will be packed this time of night well never get in
well it has to be the cabaret because theres nowhere else to go
home i think
home head on ernsts shoulder you know i cant stay up late
home is the last resort the owner of the voice
a man sitting at the bar nearby turning on his stool to face them
a dissipated dandy of a man
introducing him do you know bizzlebek the gravedigger
stonecutter if you please
sculptor if only hed admit it
no one should admit being an artist unless theyre paid for it
if you go to the cabaret mention my name theyll find a table for you
turning round again
bizzlebek has ways and means denied lesser mortals
it comes from working in the cemetery all day hes able to transcent the physical world
bizz ebek turns round again with a bored sign
no it only makes me view people dispassionately as so many
he looks about characterizing various coffee house types quartz
and then marble
its gabriela from the office
kafka is surprised to see her instinctively walking over to where shes sitting at a far table
my god look hes marching forward willingly to make human contact
shes interested in kafka
which means we must see this warm attractive girl as a threat a curse a trap
on the other hand is an enticement
kafka cant help walking towards her
sitting with her own friends though there is something less than friendly about them
two men two women
as kafka comes over hello again
ive never seen you here before
have you looked
kafka feels as awkward as she knows he feels
he looks to her friends expecting an introduction but no one makes a move
well nice to know life exists outside the office
kafka nods goodbye and walks away berating himself for banality
kafka resists going along with the others
no really i have to go home too
were keeping him from his true vocation
i know he consists of writing
we wouldnt be his friends if we didnt threaten his solitude
julius is a little drunk
the others help him with his coat
has a private moment with kafka
where do you live
he gestures in the direction of the river and the castle that looms on a far hill beyond huge and brooding regally dominating the city
i tried finding a place on castle hill when i arrived
i wanted to share the majesty
the majesty of marriage is what he fears she represents
this innocent scene could very well be a subjective kafkaesque nightmare as sinister in its own way as any of the more outright horrific scenes to come
its only majestic from here
when you get closer you see it for what it really is
what is it really
a glorified office block
they keep all the old records there the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living
well as long as i admire it from afar it shouldnt worry me if its hollow
the castle of marriage tempts him but would suffocate him
its more than hollow
for all its size it serves no purpose
its just there like death hovering over a breathing city
turn back into the picture
margarete pats kafka sympathetically
dont worry about your friend im sure hell turn up
a parting word what are you working on kafka
im writing a story about a man who wakes up one morning to find himself transformed into a giant insect
his friends glance at each other surreptitiously and dont know what to say other than goodnight turns to go when he notices bizzlebek leaning listlessly in the coffee house doorway
a figure in the shadows
ive read your stories
not sure if he believes him i dont know what you could have read
just what youve published
in magazines nobody reads
i read the one about the penal colony
cautious did you
the needles inscribing the judgement into the flesh of the man
looks impressed very good
kafka suspects hes being mocked
but perhaps not
bizzlebek steps out buttoning his coat
if i could sculpt as well as that id be quite proud of myself
hes already quite proud of himself tossing his scarf over his shoulder with a flourish and striding off into the night
seen from just below from the ancient cemetery that borders its high impregnable imperial walls
the all seeing eye of the city
an awesome edifice
kafka walking across from the old quarter toward the new town
he passes some working class types who seem vaguely threatening
do they mutter some remark behind his back
a bizarre street
tiny little houses that look fashioned by a toymaker all bunched tightly next to each other forming a continuous rooftop of odd configurations and angles and pointed chimneys
the street named after practitioners of the black arts and dark sciences who inhabited it in the sixteenth century
kafkas house is toward the back a light shining from the single upper window
through it kafka is seen sitting at the only desk that really matters to him his writing one
hes struggling to get a sentence right rereading it to himself
as gregor samsa awoke one morning from disturbing dreams he
from unsettling dreams
suddenly theres a loud knock on the front door below
kafka opens the tiny front door of this almost miniature little house
two intimidating men stand outside one tall one short wearing similar black suits and grim expressions
kafka tries to match the exacting pace of his two warders flanking him as they walk him along a corridor through another doorway
kafka tugs his collar up a bit his breath visible in the air
he has a feeling whats going to be under the sheet on the lonely trolley in the middle of the room before the first man summons him over to it
the first man yanks the sheet off the face in one quick movement
the face of eduard
white and bloated the tongue jutting the eyes bulging
kafka recoils stepping back instinctively
still behind kafka at the door you know him
his name is eduard raban
and now he hears a stirring in a dark corner
he looks up again
a third man steps out of the shadows where hes been quietly standing and walks over to kafka
he is a severe man stolid dedicated and never smiles
he reminds kafka of his father
with an introductory nod inspector grubach
the inspector behind his big desk
kafka in front of it
kafka is that your real name
yes of course why wouldnt it be
when was the last time you saw mr
we left the office together
did you go anywhere afterwards to have a drink perhaps
no we said goodbye outside the building
he went off as usual toward his house
consulting papers your office is the workmens accident and compensation association
where youve been employed for seven years
eight and seven months
engaged in the manufacture and distribution of
pills and so forth
well other departments are yes
would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close
since he came to the office almost three years ago weve been quite good friends
pause how was eduard
he was found in the river
could he swim
i dont know
was he depressed
he didnt seem to be
do you think he drowned himself
grown men dont normally fall into the river do they
no i suppose not
closing the file he might have had a drink or two despite what you think
as the interview seems to be over can i ask how you found me
his landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to
i dont think he really had any
he had no family either
we know that
he wasnt a lonely man though
what makes you think so
just a perception
kafka comes out of a door that closes behind him
he stands and waits
at a high desk a policeman is reading a newspaper
without even looking up from it he extends his arm and pushes kafka slightly to one side so hes no longer blocking the light
two other men are here waiting sitting on a bench sharing a private joke
kafka glances down at himself wondering if his appearance could in any way inspire ridicule
the door opens again and the inspector is back
i dont usually involve myself with you people in the old quarter but the river runs its own course
it wont be the last time it deposits its unwanted debris on my doorstep
anyway id like you to reflect that in me you have i wont say a friend because were complete fencers of course from distinctly incompatible social classes but to some
extent shall we say an interested third party
ill bear that in mind
hands kafka his card should you happen upon anything that might be relevant
he nods curtly at kafka and shuts his door
with eduards sheet covered form on it coming down the hall the squeaking wheels of the thing loud on the wooden floor
the noise causes him to turn around
he watches the trolley as its pushed past
similarly coffin like loaded with files
edges out of the way to let it by feeling as though it has been made for him is waiting for him
he walks on to the chief clerks office
kafka comes in
you wanted to see me sir
indicates a chair sit down kafka
and the chief clerk stands up
he paces up and down a bit making kafka awfully nervous before he finally clears his throat and starts to get to the point
youve been with the firm for nearly nine years
youve done your work diligently there are no complaints on that score
but theres more to the job than the work there are other people to consider and frankly kafka we eel your social situation could bear improving
you keep too much to yourself youre a lone wolf
it makes me uneasy and if it makes me uneasy i cant imagine the impression you make on lesser employees
the chief clerk towering over him also reminds kafka of his father
kafka tries putting up a defense
to do my work well i have little time for you must make the time
where do you go off to in the lunch hour
i usually take lunch by the river
its not healthy kafka not for you and not for your workmates
at the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance
i did not realize it was obligatory
have you never wondered and i mention this only in passing as he paces past and kafka turns his head why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while
you who have been here longer have not
it doesnt matter how well you do your work you still see it as something to be gotten on with rather than something to take an active interest in
leans forward in rebuttal well i keeps pacing oh i know you got along with that poor fellow what was his name
eduard yes raban but he was too much like you even more so perhaps
he wasnt here as long as you so i didnt know him as well but i could see the influence he was having
i simply want you to be aware of this because youll be happier for it
kafka merely nods starts to get up
in any case dont ask me why the word has come down youre to be promoted
kafka sits back down in the chair
your colleagues death has helped precipitate the need though i can tell you its been under consideration for some time
youre to be given two assistants and a commensurate rise in salary
sits back behind desk thats all
kafka nods once starts to go again
i understand you fancy yourself an author
almost visibly cringes in a small way
you might find a more athletic hobby put some color in your cheeks
he returns to his paperwork
walking away kafka notices gabriela striding along an office corridor and sneaky burgel confronting her
she looks distressed walking tall as if to bolster her composure
sneaky burgel does not help matters by characteristically appearing from the sidelines
good morning she ignores him or should i say good afternoon
say what you like no one pays the least attention
walking quickly alongside her oh dont they
i think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own
not today burgel
send one of your memos write up one of your communiques but for gods sake dont bother me today
its my place to offer advice not yours and by advising the chief clerk of your unpunctuality its certainly not my situation thats compromised if thats what youre implying
stops to glare at him youre just doing your job
its what im paid to do
and youre late
suddenly in a terrific release of pent up emotion she slaps him hard across the cheek the first of what would be a flurry of blows if not for the
fact that the unexpected force of it throws burgel reeling backwards before she can deliver any more
instead she rushes away very upset
as startled as the rest of the office by the incident
burgel recovers straightening up in shock and embarrassment
he immediately resolves to march directly to the office of the chief clerk
seeing him coming kafka quickly starts away
oskar and ludwig
they look almost the same
at first glance almost identical
its only a closer inspection that shows them to be imperfect twins
dressed in matching suits
one is sitting on kafkas new desk the other in kafkas new chair
theyre rummaging about in his papers and whenever one selects a particular document for closer scrutiny the other promptly snatches it out of his hand
coming this way has paused having spotted the weird duo
continue with their mischief until one of them notices kafka coming and nudges the other so strongly he almost falls over
theyre both standing at attention looking guilty by the time kafka arrives
my assistants i presume
yes thats us
kafka smiles at them half in friendliness half in amusement at their quirky appearance
offers his hand im kafka
oskar responds first but ludwig knocks his hand out of the way to get there first
shaking hands ludwig
now its his turn oskar
you look like brothers
yes we do
have you worked here long
no no no quite a long time yes
kafka doesnt quite know what to make of these two but they seem pleasant enough fellows and theyre looking at him with such wide eyed innocence he doesnt know what
more to say to them
so he turns to look around the new area hes been assigned a burrow all to himself now even a personal clothes peg on the wall for his coat
the assistants make stupid faces at each other behind his back but look serious again when he turns around
well wed better move things from my old desk
look at each other with identical frowns then back at kafka
oskar nods as if to say oh all right if we must
and ludwig grins
kafka types up forms
he hears some noise and glances over his shoulder to see how the assistants are getting on theyre sharing another desk facing each other and seem to be working quietly
though with pouting expressions
kafka rolls a new form into the typewriter when a shadow falls over the page
eduard and i had lunch together one day
and you saw us
kafka looks up at her
on the embankment
kafka and gabriela stroll by the river kafka finishing off his lunch as they go occasionally offering tidbits to gabriela who either samples or refuses them
i was having an affair with eduard
notes kafkas reaction he didnt tell you
he would have
you were his best friend
a better friend than me
i suspected that he well
that he was satisfied in that regard
i didnt want to pry
throws her hair back proudly its not that we wanted to deceive anyone but you know how these things are looked upon at the office
kafka lets out a smile at that
gabriela is suspicious of smiles
this morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving
as long as its on their terms
if your work and your private life dont correspond to their specifications youre labelled a dangerous agitator with no recourse whatsoever
the gnarled barren branches of a nearby tree shiver over the two of them
how long were you and eduard two or three months thats all
adds i seduced him
a flight of stone steps takes them up here to this vantage spot overlooking the river and the city beyond
kafka stands by a railing and the huge distorted shadow of someone looms suddenly on the high wall under him
you know as well as i do that he didnt commit suicide
kafka looks at her
no i dont
im amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all
eduard didnt see it as something that needed bearing
the police would know the difference wouldnt they
do you think people in the new town care what happens over here
nodding across the water this will always be the ghetto
he wasnt robbed
he was identified by his wallet
and you believe everything the authorities tell you
when i have no reason to doubt
the very fact that theyre authorities should give you reason
people will do anything to protect their own interests
for all you know he was killed at the hands of the police
what could he have done to warrant that
for a moment she seems about to tell him but then looks away
kafka follows her gaze
someone else has paused at the embankment wall further away to stare at the roiling water
hes too far away to see clearly
probably nothing sinister about him at all
turns back to kafka
are you free tonight
there are some people id like you to meet
can you come to the musil district at eight oclock
her eyes lock on his for a moment
you almost married recently didnt you
i it was broken off
eduard wanted to marry me
im suspicious of men who want to marry
i believe they think its the only thing that will make them equal to their fathers
disappears the ominous black mass flowing off the large flat surface as abruptly as it arrived
while up there on the terrace we see gabriela walk away from kafka
stays where he is a moment watching her
he may have found his ideal woman
then follows behind her i dont know the musil district
without turning you wont have any trouble finding it
sit laughing jowls gyrating around a table filled with an abnormal amount of food
one of them stops laughing then and the others follow suit one after the other in turn until theyre all silent looking at the same thing
were in a fancy restaurant and the other customers have also turned away from their dinners for the moment to stare at the man in black who stands before the
the man wears a black mask as well
he presents the fat men with a covered tray
they look at it then back at him but hes walked away
they look at the tray again and one of them lifts the cover
underneath lies the classic black bowling ball with a fuse burning at the top
the fat men all try to stand up at once but boom
their booth explodes with them in it
at the doorway holding a revolver loosely in one hand to discourage heroes the man in black turns calmly to face the stunned restaurant
hoarse voice long live anarchy
fire in his wake
kafka walks the crooked streets in the direction of the plume of smoke and illumination coming from the burning restaurant
in the dark distance behind him there seems to be a person following him
neighborhood denizens have come out hearing all the excitement not far away
kafka walks past
he looks behind him but the following figure has gone
kafka comes around a curve and sees ahead a dark figure a black cape standing waiting under a lone lamppost
when kafka gets a bit nearer the figure starts to walk slowly away as if expecting kafka to follow
the dark figure walks alongside a row of black window panes turning around the corner where they end
kafka follows around the corner and through a dingy doorway
leads him up to a large attic
gloomy except for the light around a table at a far end
kafka advances seeing gabriela sitting there with her same companions from the coffee house
kafka stops in front of the table
please sit down
kafka turns to see the last of the group come in having obviously tailed him all along
a burly man with a beard
the leader of this anarchist cell
kafka sits down in between a solemn man with a moustache and a woman with a pockmarked face
the seedy youth who led him in completes the circle
well save the introductions
takes his seat we dont know yet if youre friend or foe
strangers make better foes than friends
will you tell me who you are altogether if not individually
heralds of a new age does that sound immodest
you could say we represent the un official view of a well ordered society
to gabriela ah were back to the authorities you spoke of
what we try to do
is make them a little less so
quite a disturbance tonight yes
and perhaps you recall last month the explosion at the municipal courthouse that sent one of the examining magistrates to join the heavenly choir
disbelieving was eduard one of you
the last to join us the first to leave us
gabriela darts a fierce look at her overly flippant colleague
and kafka is sad about his dead friend for a different reason
why take me into your confidence
thats obvious isnt it
we have an opening for a new member
after a moments pause kafka stands up
i nominated you as a possible candidate
you were eduards good friend
he read me some of your work
ive hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from
you strike me as a man with a defined notion of injustice a high concern for the lot of your fellow men
and yet youre able to remain an outsider
with the concomitant air of
in short a higher man
its what we want
its what we need
kafka notices that the bearded anarchist has a tattoo on the back of his hand
the distance to my fellow man is for me quite a journey
as for being an outsider its never been a matter of choice
as kafka starts to leave they may have instituted proceedings against you
turns what proceedings
preliminary investigations may already be underway
you were his friend
one link is all they need
kafka sits down again
he tries not to be distracted by the solemn anarchist who says nothing but who takes an uncommon interest in seeing how many matches there are in the matchbox hes
been fiddling with
the day he died eduard was called up to the castle
did you know that
shakes his head what of it
he was summoned to help correct a minor discrepancy of some sort in the medical records division
apparently one of his claims was relevant
merely in the interests of order you understand
the officials at the castle like to cover their tracks
he was never seen alive again
and you still maintain what
that he was murdered
he was murdered
a skylight casts moonglow over the proceedings
as you can imagine a pass into the castle hardly ever granted was an opportunity we couldnt ignore
the castle represents every anachronism that needs to be destroyed if progress is to be made
as you know its not the most accessible location
far from being depressed eduard was particularly excited when he brought us the news of this chance invitation
he set off that evening carrying one of our custom made briefcases instead of his own
gauging kafkas reaction youre shocked at the thought of eduard tossing a bomb through a window
i have no right to be i know
my experience with real life is practically nil
when you only see someone sitting at a desk all day its liable to create a false impression
people must think the same of me a quiet dependable person
you dont have to accept everything as true my friend
you need only accept it as necessary
as the bomb never went off we can only assume he was caught with it and summarily executed
merely in the interests of order
the formality of a trial would be too costly for them
theyre beginning to understand that its the ensuing news of our actions that incites support
propaganda of the dead
the castle will deny he was there any longer than his business required
theyre just file clerks up there
no doubt he was handed over to the police with the utmost discretion
in any event weve felt no repercussions as yet
eduard must not have talked
youre the one they contacted
so thats who my foes are policemen and file clerks
law and order you might say
the solemn anarchist looks up from his matchbox
you think what were doing is so wrong
and what are you doing
to answer to some supreme tribunal
my only concern is the human tribunal
isnt it yours
yes which is why quiet dependable people have to take charge of their own lives
at the cost of others
you accuse people of murder without trial apparently without irony
did you go to the castle with eduard
apparently not then you have no idea what really might have happened that night at all even before or after he got there
he stands to leave again
your human tribunal will betray you
just as its members will be betrayed when they find no supreme one kafka starts walking away
join us kafka
kafka keeps on going the anarchists growing smaller as theyre left behind in their far corner of the long attic
its sheer folly for anyone to try to pull through alone
seeming to emanate from pitch blackness but then suddenly fast out of a tunnel under a bridge come running three terrified vagrants roused from slumber and scared out their wits
by the ghastly crazed cackling chasing after them echoing under the arches
theyre at the rivers edge all running wildly slipping and stumbling every man for himself as they desperately try to escape from whatever madness is closing in behind them
now from out of the tunnel appears their pursuer seen only from the back literally shaking with insane involuntary howling laughter
a horrific human hyena far further gone than the sad wretches hes cornered here on this foul moss covered ledge in the cold wind
seeing him the vagrants freeze in their various positions then turn in panic to flee again as he starts after them moving like an animal a killer predator laughing horribly
as he goes
the first vagrant propelled by fright manages to make a stunning leap up a wall to grab onto some overhanging chains and pull himself up
the second vagrant finds himself trapped at the edge of the ledge with the laughing man choosing him as the one to go after first
he turns and jumps into the river
the laughing man face still unseen turns toward the climbing vagrant instead who clambers over the top just in time as the laughing mans fingernails claw the moldy wall beneath
the third vagrant has made it to some steps and down them glancing back to see the laughing man coming after him to the small patch of muddy beach at
the bottom grey river water lapping at his ragged shoes
he doesnt know what to do he doesnt know how to swim
the laughing man is running down the steps now
the vagrant starts wading out into the water crying out in fear as the howls behind him come closer and closer he throws himself forward splashing vainly and feels the
laughing man grabbing his ankles pulling him back
the vagrants screams join the laughing mans insane giggles as they thrash around violently in the water
the laughing man drags the vagrant back to the beach then back up the steps the vagrant struggling helplessly his head banging from step to step his hands flailing around
but finding nothing to clutch onto his screaming going unheeded in this lonely part of the sleeping city
the laughing man drags him on back to the slippery ledge and along it dragging the vagrant on his back through a filthy sewer alongside the wall the vagrants cries
choked by the stagnant water but continuing as the laughing man drags him back into the dark tunnel under the bridge the two of them disappearing into the blackness again their combined shrieking louder than ever as it echoes horribly around the damp stone then dimming as they go deeper and further away unseen until the screaming and the laughter can no longer be distinguished
kafka walks toward his desk
nearing he sees the assistants laughing in lunacy between themselves
they hush up immediately when they notice him and are pretending to work when he arrives
he watches them out of the corner of his eye as he arranges himself at his chair
how was your evening
at this sign of sympathy they immediately scuttle their chairs closer to him
uncovering his typewriter what was the matter with it
indicating ludwig he cant sit still
just when we arrive at a nightclub he wants to go to another one
to kafka you look tired
interrupting gabriela rossman was here looking for you
do you know her
looking up do you
we saw her naked once didnt we
he elbows ludwig violently
women are all you have on your mind
she went to the roof to sunbathe one lunch hour we watched her changing
i didnt realize youd been here that long
you mean because its been a while since there was a sunny day
what a good detective you are
they keep switching us from department to department
he doesnt mind because he cant sit still
we used to be in the supply section carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them
its not too bad working here
kafka stands up pleased for them in their innocence
you dont think its a horrible double life from which there is probably no escape but insanity
the assistants look at each other perplexed by this attitude
im glad for you
he starts to go
calling after him you should be content you know
the stick like figure of kafka turns into the long center aisle walking between the endless rows of busy desks
he sidetracks taking a shortcut along a narrower aisle toward the exit hes heading for
another clerk is coming the other way and they both at the same instant turn sideways to sidle efficiently by one another an almost balletic maneuver perfected after years of
office experience nothing more than a short breath of air passing between them
kafka working his way toward gabrielas desk but he stops before he gets to it a familiar shiver running through him
the chair pushed squarely under it
the typewriter covered
stares at it then at the ermine mr
burgel who has once again popped up out of nowhere
are you looking for gabriela rossmann
burgel bows sarcastically to hand kafka an envelope
then chuckles spitefully obviously knowing something kafka does not
he walks off leaving kafka uneasy
kafka bounds up the stairs
the door to his room is open
kafka goes in
kafka comes in
gabriela is here gathering up eduards belongings from drawers
hardly glancing at him im collecting eduards things
if theres anything you want take it or ill give it to charity
taking her note from his pocket burgel gave me this what does it mean
now looks up burgel
i didnt leave it with him
going closer why were you given notice
theyre not obliged to tell
it couldnt be for that incident with burgel the other day
of course it could burgels been trying to get me thrown out as long as i can remember
he couldve killed eduard
you dont believe that
i wouldnt put it past him
shes stuffed the last of the clothes into a small bag goes to take the few other possessions from shelves and elsewhere
kafka notices that hes standing by a dumbwaiter
for lack of anything better to do he pulls the rope to bring it up
its filled with more clothes
gabriela comes over with her bag holding it out for him as kafka puts the clothes in but not as many clothes as they thought
behind the bundle hidden at the back is a briefcase
gabriela recognizes it
kafka sees her surprised reaction
he removes the case and carefully flips the latches
inside a complex mechanism wires connected to a clock and a clump of dynamite
kafka just looks at it sadly
he closes the case
it seems i knew eduard a little bit after all
the ratty old concierge peeks up the stairs inquisitively
in the doorway of his room a lodger clips his fingernails at a little folding table neatly lining them up
the concierge turns and notices
not one of them thinks to spare me such spectacles
she slams the door on him then returns to her own apartment slamming that door too
the hallway is empty now
gabriela turns to kafka
you might think i thought so myself at first that burgels too insignificant to be dangerous
but thats the very reason to beware
its the small men to watch out for the ones who substitute method for character
sighs at her relentlessness now youve fallen into his trap
when he goes to bed at night burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him
its still easier for you to understand suicide isnt it
shes got his number
hes so in awe of her he has to turn away looking out the rooms small window
that street down there i always used to call it the approach road for suicides
it leads straight down to the bridge and the river
burgel hated eduard
im sure he knew about us and im sure it drove him mad
burgel doesnt like anybody
he used to like me very much more than i liked him
hes jealous yes but that jealous
hes too cautious
gabriela clears some more items off a mantelpiece with a sweeping gesture
of course he is the castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark
people disappear up there regularly
if you want to lie in wait for someone thats the place to do it
now youre saying eduard was lured there
puts away the last few books how often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records
ive heard of it happening
and burgel is the bringer of messages isnt he
putting the bag down gabriela goes closer to kafka so close he almost cowers
or what if there really was an error
i dont know what kind any kind that needed correcting and what if burgel was responsible for it
one mistake even a small one in a firm like ours it could cost him a promotion
first these nameless authorities were the root of all evil now its insignificant burgel
if indeed there was a mistake and a minor one at that youre suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at
what seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails youre far from understanding the authorities if you believe that
now burgels one of the authorities
she turns away from him reddening
for all his big talk he is
does he really have access to the directors of the firm as he always claims
or only the deputy managers people of no importance whatsoever
someone ought to follow him for a change
kafka sees an opportunity to go to her to try to calm her to make a timid approach to this woman
you wont make any sense of it while youre upset
but she breaks away
burgel is only there for one purpose to spy on the employees and report any and all indiscretions real or imagined
if he didnt send eduard to the castle you can be damn sure hes in league with whoever greeted him there
very upset now all those bastards are in league with each other why cant you see that
she takes hold of him as if to shake some sense into him but really because she needs someone to hold
i dont see anything
i see a message on its way to me with all the right answers
only it never arrives its always just on its way
gabriela doesnt seem to be listening
shes looking around
the little room as if its someone else shes holding
her head against his kafka tentatively touches her hair and she pulls away the spell broken
your ignorance of the way things are here is so appalling that it makes my head spin to listen to you and compare what you say and have in mind
with the real situation
she storms out vehemently picking up her bag on the way out and slamming the door quakingly behind her
kafka is too astonished at her behavior to make a move for a moment then he glances at the bomb case shes left behind then he goes out to the
rushing down the stairs in anger tearing open the door at the middle landing and slamming that one too once past it
following her down
coming down the final flight of stairs disappearing through the door at the bottom slamming that one as well
almost caught up with her coming down to the last door
kafka comes through the door from the stairs out of breath and stops
hes too late
the hallway is empty
the front door at the end of it is shut
he makes a face and a moment later starts to go back up
then stops again
looks back at the front door
the one he didnt hear slam
the front door opens and kafka steps out
he stands on the stoop
he looks up the street one way
he looks down the street the other way
kafka leads the police inspector back along the lodging house hallway
the two subordinate policemen follow behind
you said she was extremely upset
people who are extremely upset kafka are given to disappearing in a hurry
they go and calm down for a day or so and then they come back
theyve come to the door to the stairs now
but thats just my point she was more than upset she was livid
she slammed every door on her way downstairs except that one
points at front door i was just behind her and i didnt even hear that one shut not at all
thats not what i call conclusive evidence of an abduction
if someone was waiting here in the hallway to spirit her away wouldnt they have shut the door as quietly as possible
the inspector stares at him
the two other policemen roll their eyes at each other
kafka keeps his eye on the two policemen as they poke around one of them getting close to the dumbwaiter
why would someone want to kidnap this woman the name is rossmann
he says it rather derisively separating the syllables of the name
you told me to contact you if anything relevant came up gabriela is relevant
when i spoke to you before i didnt know shed been seeing eduard
thats been noted
but where does it lead us
unless you have something more to add
i went to her house and she hadnt returned there
the policeman at the dumbwaiter peers down the shaft but then moves on
she lost her job today
just between you and me id probably go away and brood a bit myself
he signals his men time for them to go
the two policemen lead the way back down the inspector behind them kafka remaining on the top landing
manages to blurt out maybe its true then what she said
pauses what did she say
that the police may have allegiance to something other than truth
the two other policemen look at each other ominously
the inspector turns to them giving them a look and they go off down the stairs
the inspector plods back up to kafka like a stern parent
they confront each other kafka trying not to cringe too baldly
scary shadows around the bizarrely angled stairway
she didnt think eduard committed suicide
then any more than i do
then she was convinced of it
im going to say something and i hope its quite clear because i wont be repeating it
people treat kafka like a child
and other people seem big to him anyway
the inspector leans his face very close
we dont have to hunt for criminals
were drawn towards them
the guilty show us the way
he leaves kafka alone on the top landing
kafka comes in looks around doesnt see his friends anywhere
but at the bar at his usual perch is bizzlebek the coffee house habitue
where are your friends
kafka turns and looks at him
who are my friends
would also be of interest
bizzlebek sits listening to kafkas tale of woe
staring into steaming coffee cup gabriela was right its easier for me to understand suicide
im a practicing suicide
slightly mocking as ever in what sense
kafka stares at men and women around the coffee house couples holding hands kissing
bachelorhood is just the slow form
the bachelor doesnt sew seeds
only the moment matters
the space he occupies grows smaller and smaller until the only space right for him is his coffin
these strange stories you write they come naturally do they
thats not the word i would have chosen
seriously where do you get your ideas
quickly only joking im just joking
laughing lets go to a brothel then kafka come on
i havent got the energy
i mean i have to conserve my energy
why do you work in that hideous insurance office
dealing with people who fall off ladders
now take me i make my living as a stone mason
its not my art but its the tools of my art
you could be a journalist
kafka shakes his head sadly
hes obviously heard argument before
that would be even worse it would be a compromise
success or nothing
no not even success
my writing is not for making a living its for living
not for other people its for me
he stares at a woman who reminds him slightly of gabriela a sexy woman and the man with her treating her as a sexy woman
im the exile
gabriela was right about that too
being chased around a table by a big bearded man in flickering black and white
a great sea of grinning teeth and teary eyes
kafka sits grimly alone near the back
but suddenly hes not alone the bearded anarchist has sat down in front of him and now turns round startlingly
we have another theory
and the pockmarked anarchist is suddenly sitting beside him
we may have attached too little importance to the reason eduard was summoned to the castle to begin with
and the youthful anarchist is behind him thrusting his head suddenly forward
to correct a small discrepancy you may recall
the solemn anarchist is on kafkas other side but he just watches the movie
ah but what if it wasnt small
what if it was a large discrepancy
kafkas head keeps turning around as they speak
yours is a very powerful and important firm it has a lot at stake
perhaps eduard was closer than he knew to discovering it and so had to be silenced
or he was even more an innocent victim than that he was chosen to bear the blame if the crime was uncovered by anyone else
the crime so scandalous that the poor young clerk committed suicide rather than own up to it
thats mad oh yes its mad
the solemn anarchist suddenly laughs probably at charlie chaplin
you said so yourself the firm is large and powerful
if the discrepancy really was something big eduards responsibility would still have to be small
no poor young clerk could find himself in such a fix
sarcastic grunt when a scapegoat is needed my friend
we have to know what he was working on at the time of his death
he worked on routine claims
his visit to the castle was probably as minor a mission as he said it was
why are you so aggressively unimaginative
eduard is no longer the only casualty
then why havent i been kidnapped or murdered
because your connection with eduard was obvious and above board not as easily misconstrued
not secretive therefore not suspicious
gabriela on the other hand had made an enemy of this man burgel
head turning exasperated oh burgel
gabriela was having an affair with eduard
they were both members of this group if any crimes been discovered and people are paying for it id look to yourselves the loyal civil servant
i suppose youll deny that shortchanging the workers to whom compensation is due is standard company policy
it wouldnt surprise us if the discrepancy was between medicines sent and medicines received
people die for such discrepancies
kafkas head is spinning and the solemn anarchist suddenly looks at him
the hoarse voice of the restaurant bomber we must have a look at eduards file
cut kafka follows the keeper of the files along labyrinthine alleys between shelves packed with files
walls are obscured by columns of documents tied together piled on top of each other
theres hardly room to move
stacks of files are everywhere balancing precariously even falling from time to time from sheer pressure in all directions
vexed raban thatll be nearly at the back of the alphabet
it usually is
snaps at him im not obliged to give you access you know not without authorization but ill make an exception this one time
they turn down another row walking further turning again
kafka keeps flinching as thick bundles of documents crash down around him narrowly missing him
oblivious to the danger im overworked as it is
finds the right section raban did you say
isnt it there
the keeper of the files is rifling through folders causing others to fall out onto kafka who tries to catch them
pauses wait a minute
where have i heard that name
hes the clerk who died last week
from the insurance department the keeper of the files looks extremely displeased
he pushes past kafka going back the way theyve come
follows anxiously whats the matter
why would we keep files on dead employees
all old files are sent up to the castle
do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records
dodges another paper landslide its gone out so quickly
whenever an employee departs shall we say its up to the head of his department to requisition his file reassign any outstanding claims and send it off
you mean my chief has it
documents come crashing down and we cant see kafka and the keeper anymore
looks up from his desk and sticks his chin out which is his way of asking kafka what the hell he wants
kafka dares to come in
excuse me sir i understand you have eduard rabans file
i wonder if i might look to see if theres an address for family i thought id like to write to them
the chief clerk has little time for such sentimentality
he gives kafka a little exasperated look before reaching down to a right hand desk drawer which kafka notices and taking out a folder
no just as i thought no entry for family
kafka nods a bit wondering what to do now
was there something else
no i just i feel a sense of obligation
he was my friend if i can be of any help closing his affairs
putting file away again no theres only one report to complete
ill be doing it myself and submitting it to the castle today or tomorrow
as ingenuously as possible i see its just the erlanger claim then
looks up the orlac claim
sorry yes well thank you sir
the chief clerk watches him as he starts to leave
kafka reluctantly turns
youre too sensitive
let your friend rest in peace
returning to paperwork ive known suicides
such a song and dance about nothing
kafka nods once
the chief clerk looks at him with seemingly genuine misguided concern
give it up
he goes back to his paperwork
kafka shuts the door behind him breathes a sigh of relief
looking very annoyed leading kafka back through the stacks
if it was accounts you wanted why did you ask for employees
orlac is an account
its a factory in the northern mountains
one of our best customers
as they disappear around a corner without a proper request im not obliged to do this you understand but ill make an exception on this one occasion
kafka glances nervously around as shelves creak threateningly under the weight of documents
up on a ladder the keeper of the files finds the orlac folder
at least the account is current even if the employee isnt
he pulls it out with great difficulty
the orlac file is very very thick
kafka prepares himself to catch it but the keeper of the files manages to hand it down to him without serious injury
still its quite cumbersome and heavier than kafka expects
coming down ladder that place has so many accidents its a good thing the type of peasants who live up there dont seem to have any trouble propagating their race
kafka winces at that slur but says nothing about it
leafing through pages all these in the last year
you must have read about it in the papers there was a terrible cave in
it wouldnt have been so bad but even the medical officer for the district was killed
i did read that
they gave him a posthumous medal
murnau was the bravest of men
he spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain
a great loss
a particular document this is the cross reference of clerks whove worked on orlac claims
nods is your friends name among them
kafka shakes his head then he only worked on the one case
taking file back again your chief will send me the final summation when hes finished with it
once a files been sent to the caste is it possible to recall it for review
going back up ladder of course not
only by a director of the firm
whod want to let in all kinds of riff raff off the streets
what good are records if theyre not open for public inspection
stuffing file back in place these laws have been with us for centuries how can you doubt them
what if i petitioned one of the directors
coming back down you do not summon them they summon you and this of course hardly ever happens if at all
the directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious
where do our records go to in the castle
starting to walk away were a medical firm arent we
they go to the medical records section
i could always apply there
it so happens my dear simple sir that the head of medical records at the castle is one of the directors of this firm
kafka scowls and follows the keeper of the files in silence
kafka works at his desk finger tapping at an adding machine
he checks the office clock nearly the end of the day
one is sweeping the floor
the other is scribbling at their desk
his pen blotches his paper
he has a fit and crumples it up and throws it down
looks over at the chief clerks office sees him writing intently at his desk pausing to turn on a lamp
the sweeping one bangs his knee against a desk and starts hopping about
the pen of the other one leaks again
he crumples up his new sheet and flings it away even more angrily than before
then he examines his pen determines that the cap at the back is loose and starts banging it on his desk in an attempt to tighten it while the other
assistant keeps jumping around holding his hurt kneecap
glances over his shoulder at them starts to say something but then notices burgel not far away sometimes blocked by other employees walking in the direction of the chief clerks
the one assistant has just fixed his pen when the other one still hopping around bumps into him causing him to knock over a bottle of ink
the two of them start shoving each other about
kafka whirls around cant ignore them any longer
do you mind
the assistants look at him surprised at this outburst
i was just trying to finish some work
you mean youve actually begun some
pointing at oskar just because hes done nothing today he doesnt want me to show him up
oskar tries to lunge at ludwig but kafka holds him back
you might as well have fallen from the sky for all the thought that was spent in choosing you
the assistants look at each other sheepishly
then smile at kafka submissively or mockingly its hard to tell
its not our fault
were naturally nervous
and were upset too
whats the matter with you
i cant make a simple statement without him taking issue with it you should meet my father
weve been together too long
his personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa
how would you like to be in a horrible situation like that
its the nightmare of his life
but now hes distracted again noticing burgel walking away from the chief clerks office without ever having seem him actually enter it
and burgel is carrying a parcel under his arm
to assistants again all right you might as well go home go on
the assistants do as theyre told oskar returning to his desk to clear up turning his back on ludwig at which ludwig immediately rushes up very close behind him and
shakes his fist strenuously at him turning away quickly when oskar turns around again to try and catch ludwig at it
kafka isnt paying them any attention anymore
he efficiently cleans up his own space keeping an eye on the chief clerks office
when the office bell rings the chief clerk immediately turns off his desk lamp puts on his overcoat and shuts his office light on his way out
kafka doesnt think twice
he forces himself to start walking to the chief clerks office
other departing office employees crisscross past him but he walks in a straight line businesslike toward the chief clerks office
he has a piece of paper in his hand
he enters the chief clerks office holds the paper out to drop on the chief clerks desk but lets it slip off onto the floor
when he bends to retrieve it he quickly opens that bottom drawer where eduards file was but its now empty
burgel walks along adjusting the parcel under his arm
burgel heads into the old town
pauses in some shadows
he glances up at the distance the way burgel is going up at almost glowing as its outlined against the blue of the darkening night
giving kafka the eye as he goes past doorway after doorway filled with their frightening tempting forms
but he tries never to lose focus on the small form of burgel further up the street
men milling about up and down the street prostitutes roaming amongst them kafka negotiating his way through
an urgent moment when he almost loses burgel then sees him turning down an alley
kafka hurries after him avoiding a pair of drunken louts in the way
the castle visible but still a little in the distance
kafka comes into view
he sees burgel entering a building
burgel leaves the top of the stairs and walks down to a room at the end
kafka waits momentarily at the bottom then goes up
peeking around the corner he sees a young girl embracing burgel in her doorway before letting him in
kafka comes out of the building
he hears a noise turns around sees burgel and the girl on the tiny baroque balcony outside her room
kafka retreats into the shadows
he watches the girl unwrap the parcel burgels given her
she smiles as a box of chocolates is revealed
watches with an expression of guilt sadness
until a door suddenly opens at his back
a man shuffles out past him
a rather ugly woman in a dressing gown holds the door open giving kafka a cursory look
beyond her inside a quick glimpse of masochist yelping as hes whipped
well whatre you waiting for
shes nodding him inside
kafka backs away from her and her invitation
kafka heads for the dilapidated building or the anarchists
he goes through
a mouse scurries past him across the threshold
leads him up to the attic
watches kafkas approach
but sees nothing
his eyes are wide open but lifeless
kafka stops at the anarchists table
theyre all lying around it on the floor except for the pockmarked anarchist whos slumped over it her face sunk in a pool of her own blood
the youthful anarchist lies on his back mouth open still dribbling red
the solemn anarchist seems less than solemn due to the almost comic convoluted broken backed position hes in
and the neck of the bearded anarchist is all twisted
kafka just stares in disbelief then scratch
a noise from a spiral staircase close by leading to the roof
kafka looks around in panic the attic entrance is too far to run to and theres nowhere else to hide
a man appears from above mr
legs draped in expensive trousers the skirt of his high buttoned coat flowing around them due to the breeze from the roof
come on theres no one up there
were going now
he raises his arm up to help down whoever it is hes talking to
we hear a strange groan
followed by the appearance unclear from the back face hidden or otherwise blocked by mr
pick of a strange hunched figure
he moves in a halting cowering way
pick helps him down the steps
thats it its all right youve done very well
picks voice is reassuring though he has a dark diabolic face
theyre at the bottom of the staircase now mr
pick leading his odd companion toward the exit
the odd companion lurches towards the dead anarchists but mr
pick restrains him
never mind them theyll be attended to
pretending to be one of the dead anarchists
hiding under the large body of the bearded anarchist
trying hard to emulate his lack of movement
blood from the bearded anarchists ear drips onto kafkas face
he tries to blink it away while his other eye remains fixed on the two figures walking away to the doorway until theyre through it and gone
after a moment he unloads the bearded anarchist and softly hurries over to the attic doorway
the strange man utters another low moan as mr
pick leads him like a dog down the creaking old steps
comes cautiously out onto the landing
he leans over the bannister watching the two figures slowly going down the long stairs vanishing from sight at a certain turn of the staircase on every floor and coming
into view after a moment or so
pick and the strange one walk away
follows at a respectable distance
he pauses when he hears a wagon looking back at the anarchists building to see it pulling up outside
the driver jumps to the ground
kafka looks from the wagon to the two men walking away in the distance and makes his choice continuing after the two men
on the outskirts of the city beyond the castle
pick and the strange man approach
some distance behind them kafka takes cover behind a tree watching
pick leads the strange man down the central quarry to where a third man a laborer by the look of him is waiting
kafka finds a vantage point somewhere above the central quarry
he flattens himself on the ground and peers over the edge
in the quarry mr
pick steps back a pace from the strange man as they meet up with the laborer and suddenly grabs the strange man pinning his arms behind him baring his chest
or the laborer to stab a dagger into
kafka is shocked by the abruptness of this
he sees the strange man slump to the ground
he crawls a little closer
he sees the laborer replace the knife in its sheath on his belt then help mr
pick drag the strange man off to some side shadows where they dump him
kafka strains forward a little trying to make out their faces and the ground gives way
spin around at the noise
lands at the bottom of the incline dazed
hes still quite far away from the other end of the quarry where they are
look at each other once then go after the intruder
sees them coming
scrambles to his feet
it takes him a split second to establish his options
namely the best route is back up the way he came
if only he can get up it again as fast
pick and the laborer start to run
kafka starts to climb
the incline is steep
the gravel is loose
he slips back down
pick and the laborer are gaining speed
kafka digs his fingers into the dirt pulling himself up with all his might even though his shoes dont sustain holds
pick is a better runner than the burly laborer
hes almost there
kafka slips back down again
pick could almost grab him but kafka literally throws himself up the slope again gasping and mr
pick stretches but cant reach that far and kafkas nearly at the top again mr
pick climbing after him now and kafkas arm comes over the edge he struggles over kicking gravel back down in mr
pick slides back down to the bottom and kafkas gone
the laborer fell over mr
pick as he came crashing back down now mr
pick pushes him off in one direction while he goes another
escaping back into the old quarter kafka runs downhill
but even the momentum doesnt carry him as fast as hed like
a number of streets branching off
kafka sees mr
pick coming down one of them and the laborer coming down another
kafka runs off along a third
looks behind him
pick is coming
he runs faster under a weird archway
looks behind him
pick and the laborer are coming
kafka darts down a side street
another twisting little road
he winds around one corner only to be met by another the end of this street impossible to determine
pick and the laborer are catching up
turns another corner and finds himself at the bottom of an incredibly long flight of steps
a staired street
on and on and on
he doesnt know if he can make it
come around look at the steps look at each other
they take deep breaths and start up
here they come huffing and puffing
kafka comes out from behind an extravagantly designed iron gate grillwork
he sneaks away back the way he came
the body of the strange man lies face down where it was dropped
kafka walks toward it looking around nervously in case anyones coming
when he gets to the corpse he hears the sound of an approaching wagon
he crouches quickly by the body to do what hes come here to do turn it over to look at of a monster
horribly disfigured scarred and stitched
and it isnt the kind of patchwork mess caused by acid or accident
there seems to be design behind it
and beneath all this warped mutilated flesh almost unrecognizable
the features of the vagrant snatched from the river
parks above the quarry
the evil looking driver jumps down and pulls a large sack off the back
he starts down into the quarry
appears over another edge
he looks over at the wagon
he sees that now the back is loaded up and covered by a sheet of tarpaulin
all the bodies are gone
even the floorboards and pieces of furniture that might have had blood stains on them have been torn away and removed
kafka stands alone
an eerie moon shines over the castle
he comes in
before taking off his coat he finds in a pocket inspector grubachs card
but what can he do again without evidence
he puts the card back in the pocket
he sits writing into the night in his little room under a low ceiling
oh and thank you for the suit from father although i dont know why he didnt simply return it
if its too small for him why do you immediately suppose it will fit me
your loving son
your somewhat loving son
your occasionally loving son
your incapable of loving son
your absolutely bored to death with any kind of family life son
the barking of a dog outside distracts him
he stands up to stretch by his open window and we see that hes wearing a suit thats far too big for him sleeves overhanging his skinny arms and ands
trouser bottoms drowning his shoes
he looks out at the sky which is turning blue
two men walk across the river
rolls along one of the moribund streets of the old town
the driver swivels in his seat looking over his wide shoulder as if to see if hes being followed
the glint in his eye suggests evil
kafka puts a stamp on his letter then adds it to the stack of obsessive correspondence already piled on one corner of his desk
with an ink pad stamp kafka pounds the date onto a succession of documents
jump in unison when the bell goes off
then in their hurry to leave start shoving all their papers and whatnots haphazardly into various drawers opening and slamming them regardless of whether or not the contents are fully
inside resulting in a lot of crumpled documents and snapped pencils
suddenly hovering by kafkas side handing him something
the chief clerk would like this ready for tomorrow morning
oily he says it should only take you an extra hour or two
dead silence after the daily racket of typewriters and telephones and adding machines
kafka works alone in the utterly deserted office building
he looks out the window and sees a policeman walking by on the street below
he thinks again about going to the law but goes back to work
he hears a sound
he looks around
a sort of a scratching sound
its coming from the other end of the office somewhere
maybe the bathroom
kafka walks slowly back there
at the bathroom door he pauses momentarily then turns the handle to go inside
kafka looks for the source of the sound and in sudden startled shock instantly finds it where a huge arm has just been thrust through a small high window and
the ugly hand at the end of the arm is feeling around for the window latch
kafka starts backing away as the hand flips open the latch and now the window swinging open with a bang and the rest of the intruder starts coming into view
out before all of him appears kafka has run out and slammed the door behind him
kafka pulls a desk across the bathroom doorway
the maniac because thats what his posture and breathing seen from the back suggest lurches into the bathroom from the window
kafka grabs his coat and an umbrella off a rack
he looks back at the bathroom the desk rocking back and forth as the intruder behind the door pushes
kafka runs away
he runs to the elevator sliding open the gate
the desk tips over as the bathroom door is forced open
the elevator cranking slowly downwards
then nearing the ground floor it slows down even further
then it suddenly stops dead
kafka reaches for the walls to steady himself
he looks through the gate assessing the distance to the ground floor below
he tries the gate but it wont open
calls down there help
he looks around the tiny space of the elevator
the roof hatch
he reaches up pushes it open starts to climb up and yaahh
the maniacs face appears in the opening
its another monster face this one even worse than the one kafka uncovered at the quarries
a groaning drooling misshapen lump of wrinkled tissue
and its owners arms now come through to stretch after kafka
kafka beats them back with the umbrella while still trying to pull the unyielding gate open
the maniac yelps as kafka bashes the umbrella up at him dodging his head out of the way each time the umbrella sweeps back at him swinging his thick arms
wildly to ward off blows and try and snatch the umbrella for himself
he finally retreats under the barrage of blows and kafka quickly takes the opportunity to lever open the gate with the umbrella
the maniacs face reappears overhead
kafka stabs the umbrella up at him some more and the maniac manages to grab it
kafka sits down on the elevator edge to jump down to the ground floor and lunges forward from above scooping both arms down in a vain attempt to catch kafka
just as he drops out of sight landing on the ground floor with a roll
the maniac howls at his failure his features even more horribly contorted practically filling the small opening of the roof hatch as he shrieks
and as his atrocious face comes closer and closer and closer one of his eyeballs falls out
out of the socket suddenly dangling into the elevator hanging by a single sinewy bloody thread
the maniac cries out and reaches for the eyeball bringing it back up to try and stuff back in place
kafka runs away from the office building in horror off into the night
he stands at a corner looking at his own house scared even to go home
but everything seems normal
he starts walking there
but when he reaches his front door did you think youd be safe back in your little burrow
one of the assistants stands next to him
no matter how deep a hole you dig for yourself the beast will always find you
kafka turns the other way
the other assistant is on his other side
kafka looks between the two of them
were to take you to the castle
kafka might have expected this
youre the guides up there
and we thought it was burgel
one of the assistants draws a revolver
the other chuckles
they wouldnt let burgel into the castle
you should look upon this as a great favor
kafka starts walking the way a flick of the revolver indicates the assistants flanking him
i dont want any favors from the castle just my rights
we answer directly to ekman the senior partner he practically runs the castle
in a case like this youre better off dealing with the highest authority even though its equally futile
when you speak to him you have to lean quite near his right ear because the left doesnt work so well
they head up in the direction of the castle
for all your incompetence i was beginning to think you were at least loyal to me
youre very good ham actors
just doing our job
its a farce
we think youd better accept your position instead of pointlessly annoying us
being prosecuted in a case like this means having already lost it
still were probably closer to you at the moment than any of your fellow human beings
close only by virtue of antithesis
one of the assistants keeps making a show of wiping his brow though its by no means hot
kafka walks stiffly between the assistants the three of them almost locked together as one unit like lifeless matter
shaking his head my assistants
i should have known
nothing is given to me
i have to acquire everything
laughs its all right to be sarcastic in private to us because we have a sense of humor but when were up at the castle we suggest you dont make
it would spoil the not unfavorable impression you make in other respects
frankly we dont understand why youve even bothered pursuing this business
it would be more accurate to say that it has pursued me
but your goal is so hard to reach
do you think the official network would surrender to one man
we would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult
my mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that not even mentioning accidents the span
of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip
kafka suddenly points at the ground
youve dropped some money
the assistants immediately bend their heads to look and kafka bangs them together as hard as he can
the assistants sit on the ground in a stupefied daze while kafkas running footsteps echo around the dark street
bizzlebek perched on his usual stool turns to see kafka at his side
you work in the cemetery
a man must eat raises glass and drink
the castle cemetery
ancient tombstones crumbling with age slanting out of the ground at bizarre angles and cluttered so close together that a way can scarcely be made between them
bizzlebek leads kafka along the crooked little pathways overgrown with crawling weeds upwards towards the high section of the cemetery under the dark wall of the castle
bizzlebek who knows his way around seems more cheerful here than weve seen him before
kafka more fearful
creaking trees cast ghastly shadows
scary tombs all shapes and sizes strange symbolic symbols on them mystical figures and designs
trying to keep up with bizzlebek kafka spots a horrendous shape looming ahead of him
he starts to bypass it and jumps when a tall plant brushes against him
waits for kafka are you sure you wouldnt prefer going through official channels
the awful dark shape turns out to be no more than a particularly large tombstone crumbled in places to give it an animal like suggestion
official channels a lot of good theyve done me
my only hope is to approach the officials personally
he keeps walking and we see that hes carrying the bomb briefcase he found at eduards
im flattered of course to be considered a friend even without knowing all the details
kafka doesnt take that cue to see such determination is reward enough for me
the kafka men are famous for it you know
delivering meat barefoot in the depths of winter picking up sacks of flour with their teeth a bird rapidly swoops down from a tree zipping past kafkas head with a
gulp oh yes determination runs in the family
there is one thing id like you to tell me
im trying to find things out myself thats the whole point
what made you think id be able to get you into the castle
the cemetery is nearer the castle than anywhere else wasnt it part of the castle originally
i always assumed thered be a gate or something
stops again concerned isnt there
in a manner of speaking
theyre at the graves at the very back of the cemetery right up against the bottom of the castle wall that stretches high above them into the black sky of
trees quiver around them
bizzlebek pauses at a particular grave apart from the others more hidden by overgrowth
he runs his fingertips over the old strangely lettered inscription
he looks around the graveyard making sure theyre alone then he moves to one side of the stone and leans his weight against it pushing
it shifts and slides open uncovering the hole that lies beneath
i was restoring some stones here in the upper section one day and i found this
unclear an empty tomb
a cenotaph a monument to someone whose remains ended up elsewhere
but look having lit the lantern hes brought with him he holds it over the dark hole revealing a shaft and the rungs of a ladder
the castle gates were blockaded in the time of the great plague its an escape route
offers kafka the lantern dont get stuck
accepts it not a chance
im the thinnest person i know
kafka starts to climb down shoes loud on the rungs affixed to the stone wall of this well
but then he remembers something pops back up
you appreciate my writing
taken aback yes
will you do me a favor then
if i dont see you later go to my house and find my notebooks and destroy them
all my manuscripts just burn them
what an extraordinary request
its my last and final one
then its authority is in doubt
a true friend would do it
a pointed look wife would
a stooping kafka makes his way along this gloomy underground artery the lantern lighting the way
he comes to the end of it and what appears to be a little door
he bends low to listen at it then unlocks the latch
he pushes and the door moves forward
kafka stands up and hes inside a big filing cabinet drawer he steps out of it and looks around
hes in an entire room full of file cabinet drawers
a morgue of file cabinet drawers
he shuts the one he came out of before walking away
d says the label on the outside of it
kafka makes his way through the shadows down here in the underground depths of the castle
a fiery glow and noise comes from an archway ahead of him
when he gets to it and looks through he sees a sweating stoker shoveling coal into a giant furnace
a sudden door slam
kafka dodges back around a corner
he hears the quick cry of a mans agony a scuffle of shoes on hard stone floor a dull thud a wave of peculiar shouts running footsteps more mumbled mingled
voices which soon die out leaving silence
kafka walks slowly straining his neck a bit in expectation of whatever lies ahead
the passage brings him to a row of dungeon cells
a line of doors with a barred window in each
one of them isnt closed and lying across the threshold is the laborer who chased kafka from the quarries the other night
the knife is gone from his sheath and his scull is caved in a wooden stool lying on the floor beside him
at the other end of the row of cells another door swings open at the top of a few steps
suddenly fingers spear through the bars of another cell to touch kafka
a gaunt man inside
youve killed him
like a dog
kafka dropped his lantern in surprise and shrinks back crunching glass
they wont like that
not a bit
i didnt the inhabitants of the other cells start rattling their bars and beseeching kafka
he looks around bewildered and horrified
hideous faces looking back at him
youll incriminate the rest of us
let me out too
shuddering kafka is moving away making it through the shocking gauntlet toward the door at the other end
yelling above the din youre in the bowels now my friend
youve thrown yourself in it now
a haggard man who may have had his tongue cut out gestures desperately at a lever on the wall to unlock the cells
kafka starts to tentatively reach for it when theres a sudden shriek beside him
he whirls to see behind more bars the raving convoluted face of the creature that stalked him at his office whose loose eye has now gone completely banging violently against
let me out im all right they havent treated me yet
we can go together
but now the evil mr
pick appears at the end of the passage from which kafka came a gun in his hand
you kafka yanks the lever and runs away
pick fires after him starting to chase but the prisoners are coming out of their cells coming for him
kafka runs upwards around and around and around
here is a part of the castle kafka can understand office workers toiling away
kafka walks past one long row of them scribes sitting at a single endless desk
they look like students under examination hunched over their writing a virtual conveyor belt of paperwork
in the center of this floor is an actual conveyor a chain pulley running slowly up and down presumably throughout the entire castle through small holes in the floor and
there are little pockets on the chain which the clerks continually pluck papers out of and slip papers into
the ink bottle of one of the scribes runs dry
he takes it over to a sink with three taps hot cold and the third one he turns ink kafka passes a friendly clerk
are you lost
kafka nearly laughs at the enormity of the question
im uh looking for the medical records section
oh youre miles away
from here youll want to go left left again right right again left then right right then left and take the blue staircase
going on his way i havent seen you here before
he stands there a man in a suit with a briefcase in an antiseptic corridor
pick leans against a door trying to keep back the howling horde of prisoners pushing from the other side
another jailer joins him helping him to try and push the door closed
then a second jailer too
a bestial hand reaches through and mr
pick presses his pistol muzzle into the outstretched palm a book falls to the floor like a pistol shot and kafka hides back in shadows hoping no one heard
hes in a round surrounded by books from floor to ceiling even on the tall door through which he entered
a sliver of light gives it away and on the other side of it he hears footsteps
but they pass by
theres another sliver of light indicating another door in the books opposite him
he walks over and pulls on the shelves
here the dark wood is merely a disguising cover for the shiny modern steel he discovers on the other side of it and he finds more than that as he
enters a real mad scientists workshop
chemicals of bizarre colors rush and fizz through mazes of glass pipes and beakers in some places boiling and steaming in others frosting or freezing
circuits and test tubes flash and glow as sparks and filamentary arcs crackle with electric incandescence
insane instruments and devices interconnected with complex wires perform strange and villainous functions
its the most modern setting weve yet seen but at the same time all this futuristic technology seems somehow archaic as if put together from old familiar materials and elements
both eccentric and eclectic
the chain that runs through the floors of the castle carrying documents runs up and down through the laboratory too
amidst this feast for the eyes what kafka now focuses in on a simple cigarette left smoking in an ashtray
and by the look of the ash not very long ago
kafka looks around anxiously notices an archway leading to another room
mr pick and the two jailers cant hold back the dreadful prisoners any longer
pick runs letting the jailers fend for themselves
kafka comes into what looks like a small museum vertical glass cases in which naked bodies float suspended in preserving gelatin solution
kafka seems deadened himself by all that hes seeing until he sees someone he recognizes
the bearded anarchist
kafka goes closer
looking down he sees that the bearded anarchist has a hand missing
the other anarchists are here in glass cases too
now with a gasp kafka turns around looking for gabriela but shes not here
holding himself together and with new determination etched on his face kafka walks to the center of the lab and an operating table
ignoring the implications of the table he sets down the bomb briefcase flicking the latches to open it
the sight of the explosive mechanism inside causes him a moments hesitation but a look round at various animal parts hanging from hooks above the table or bobbing in jars
alongside sinister implements laid out in preparation for an operation renews his anger and he decisively turns the dial on the bombs timer clock setting it to the maximum allowance of one hour
he closes the case and locks its latches
the case begins to kafka takes it to a dark spot beneath the mass of elaborate laboratory equipment hides it under there and leaves
kafka tries finding his way back the way he came
kafka looks down a long dark staircase a hint of light glowing at the bottom
just as he reaches the light something lunges at him from one side
its the laughing man hysterical as ever face now seen for the first time screeching salivating eyes watering
the human hyena
his grin contorts his face from ear to ear his cackling is truly terrifying and the hand he stretches forward has a tattoo on it bearded anarchists hand a hand
too big for his wrist reaching reaching reaching for kafka
the laughing man pushes kafka down into a chair and shakes with uncontrollable sobbing shrieks
someone else is sitting in darkness behind a huge desk murnau
his hand holds out a small vial
the laughing man grabs it and leaves gulping down its contents voraciously
i assume youre wondering
what all this has been about
kafka tries to see into the shadows
are you the head of medical records
the door behind kafka opens again and an officious bureaucrat ekman comes in
he sits in a chair and looks at kafka
to ekman hes come on his own initiative
to kafka not something we encourage mind you but we like to know it exists
and hes stood up
what it amounts to is simply this
hes coming around the desk
hes drying his hands on a towel
a piece of paper was delivered to the wrong clerk
it was essential he bring it back to us
these complications have arisen because he had friends like you among others friends unlikely to let a sleeping dog lie
he tosses the towel onto the desk
ekman looks irritated by this
a piece of paper
a mere slip
coming forward your friend mr
raban dealt only with claims that came in another department being responsible for compensation that goes out this is correct
he places a fatherly hand on kafkas shoulder
not quite in the light yet through a very unfortunate and i might add extremely rare mishap a document intended for the one department was sent to the other
and for the first time though your friend wasnt aware of it two and two could have been put together to make one
again a piece of paper
face bending into the light you see kafka in all cases relating to the factory at orlac which is what this paper referred to the authority that puts in a
request and the authority that grants it is to all intents and purposes the same authority
and hes an impressive imposing figure of authority himself
youd probably trust him
youd certainly respect him
but if you look into his eyes hes frightening
pick runs from the crazed prisoners chasing him
fires his gun back at them dropping one or two but then runs out of bullets
the prisoners slowly surround him
he backs away
one of those chains that run throughout the castle has its base here
pick keeps backing up unavoidably the deranged prisoners closing in until he falls backwards with a cry into the grinding wheels of the chain system
caught up in the chain hes carried aloft with it up to the ceiling
the chain is the lifeline of the castle and does not could not ever stop
instead it forces mr
pick to go along with it his head cracking through the glass or wood manhole cover through which the chain passes
kafka tries not to flinch in the presence of this deadly figure
you seem amused
it only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being
ekman sighs as if at a difficult child
its merely a matter of expediency
its imperative that my room to maneuver not be hindered by
ekman who doesnt hear very well directs one ear in particular back and forth between the other two
kafka just keeps looking at the charismatic man pacing around him whos now lighting an expensive cigarette of the kind that was in the ashtray at the lab
if an obscure official up there in the distant mountains so far away from civilizing influences happens to meet with an unfortunate accident and should he tragically die in spite
of the district medical officers strenuous efforts to save him the firm wants to see the next of kin pacified and the disposition of the remains handled with the greatest possible
becoming clearer accident and compensation no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises
to ekman i believe weve exceeded his expectations
virtually to himself i had the grandest of financial plots in mind the most malevolent of personal motives conspiracy theories extending to every
authority i could see
looks up and i find you
a body snatcher
life is more than a chinese puzzle my friend
uniformly like a chorus line the infinite row of clerks turn their heads from their single endless desk when they hear an awful noise mr
pick is breaking through from the floor below
the inexorably rising chain has hauled him floor by floor through the castle breaking open holes too small for his body shredding him along the way and still carrying him
upwards kafka walks along with murnau and ekman
the laughing man holds kafkas arm
and i suppose dr
murnau didnt die in a cave in
you killed him to free the position of orlac medical officer for your own ends
yes well were looking for a new village now
if we stay too long at one source
people become suspicious
they pass another of those grinding chains carrying memos and inter office directives up and down
but youre quite right that he didnt die in that cave in
in fact he didnt die at all
he was simply recalled by himself
as well as being head of medical records here and director of your firm im dr
murnau of course
the laughing man giggles crazily
the laughing man subdued for a moment merely smiles a little opening the door to let kafka in first guarding him close
murnau then leads the way across to his laboratory door
may i ask where your two warders are
lying in the gutter where they belong
murnau laughs but then has to stop as it encourages the laughing man bringing forth a mad chuckle or two from him
theyre an amusing pair didnt you find
he pushes the tall door open into his lab
murnau spreads his hands proudly as they enter displaying his amazing factory
i so rarely get the chance of showing my work to anybody anybody capable of appreciating it that is
you might say im a student of human reaction
ekman whos seen it all before goes to lean somewhere bored
the fact that its live bodies you practice your trade on doesnt seem to matter to you
on the contrary it matters a great deal
were engaged in immensely important research here
im a revolutionary too you know but a much more pragmatic one
as if in response to that the laughing man convulses anew
ekman immediately turns to a shelf for another vial and goes to give it to the laughing man
i cant very well administer experimental treatments to corpses and if they become corpses why they have their uses too thats why speed is essential
living tissue even if its owner has passed on is our most valuable acquisition
the laughing man gulps down the potion and starts to calm down a little
weve tried transfusions on our
unfortunately far from infusing superior characteristics its tended to make them insane murderous even a condition weve had occasion to make use of
ticking lightly away
the clock inside the bomb case becoming visible as if by x ray is seen to be a matter of minutes away from blast off
murnau walks to where the elaborate distillation processes are going on
the very section where kafka hid the bomb
kafka wipes his brow quickly conscious of ekman staring at him
murnau gazes obsessively at his contraptions his piercing eyes following the routes of the flowing chemicals
and the new patients they bring me arent usually as dexterous as youve been in evading us
not perfect specimens by any means but not the type of person wholl be missed either
what have you done with gabriela rossmann
as a matter of fact youve caught us in a state of considerable excitement
our latest preparation we believe we pray is perfected
it should take years off her
hes concocting another potion now pouring an acidic looking liquid from one container to another
kafka is looking increasingly worried
and if not well there are always what i call my caprices of vivisection
he glances at the dangling animal parts
and now finished mixing his cocktail he picks up some sort of suturing tool pressing the trigger on it to start the end burning and actually if it werent for
the aberrant dilemma posed by someone like yourself continually asking for out of date files id probably give up my revisionist policies altogether
im sure what we have to do is start instead at the very inception with the embryo from a single cell even
leers at kafka the lure of the golem the man made man
you appreciate that i know
ekman takes kafka by the arm to lead him toward the operating table
the laughing man moves in closer too emitting a psychotic chortle
to corrupt the image of man and then offer redemption
this is the dawn kafka
a new man is being born here
a more resilient man
kafka attempts an escape around the operating table but the laughing man blocks his way and corrals him back to where he was before
murnau holds out the sinister aperitif for kafka to take and drink in toast
to a new world of gods and monsters
the glass comes closer and closer to kafkas lips if he leans away from it any further hell be lying on the operating table but now a wrenching noise makes
the body of mr
pick bloody and ragged is dragged up with a smash through a breaking floor panel by the great chain
kafka has his chance
the next time anyone looks at him hes holding the nozzle of the burning device under ekmans throat finger on the trigger
and on the other side of the laboratory a wide elevator platform rises into view carrying the prisoners from the dungeons
throws ekman aside and runs away
falls to the floor holding his hands up over his head with a scream as the ghastly creatures from the depths converge on him but they pass him by intent
on getting murnau
the last out of the elevator is the most horrible beast man yet and we finally see the use to which various animal parts have been put
just stands by the operating table waiting for them
he knows theres no way out and hes far too practical a man to waste energy running or screaming
kafka running through the castle through door after door after door after door leaving them all banging behind him back and forth
ekman stumbles to his feet watching in horror as the prisoners of the castle strap murnau to his own operating table
one by one the prisoners file past the intricate surgical tools neatly laid out on white cloth
each prisoner selects the implement of his choice
ekman too runs away out of the laboratory
the laughing man snickering isnt sure whose side hes on
but then laughter building he goes to join the others in line
kafka still running in the maze through a final door
and he finds himself right back in with the brightness of the laboratory facing him through its open door
horrible sounds coming from in there
running again through the maze of corridors
he hears running footsteps behind him looks back to see ekman running after him
ekman catches up but runs past kafka in his panic to escape out onto a metal walkway around a central area of offices
murnau cant be seen only the deranged men huddled closely around the operating table
abruptly stops ticking
the floors shudder as the boom in the laboratory is heard and felt
the metal walkway breaks and ekman goes sliding off it while kafka manages to hang on
he ducks his face down as glass from all the surrounding office windows shatters and showers and then paper starts sailing down all around
literally a hailstorm of documents
on the floor below where he fell ekman tries to stand but the falling flurry of paper keeps him at bay
he waves his hands wildly trying to see his way through it all but its too much
now his feet are trapped in it
its starting to rise around his legs
papers are fluttering down from floors and floors of surrounding offices above filling the air
ekman suffocates and drowns and disappears in the paper piling up around him one lone arm and hand the last we see of him
totally wrecked and jutting out of the broken walls are burst pipes spurting red blue and black ink everywhere
kafka is managing to climb back onto the unsafe metal walkway when zing
a bullet ricochets near him
theyve nearly fallen through another doorway where the walkway on that side broke but got each other stuck in the door just in time
one of them is wildly firing a revolver in kafkas direction
the other tries to grab it and both fire it together in all directions
kafka runs away avoiding a snake of broken wire flipping about sparking off the metal
the assistants shoving each other extricate themselves back through their doorway to find another way to chase kafka
the burst ink pipes drip empty
the sound of maniacal laughter abruptly stops
the ink has filled the lab halfway to the ceiling
its covered everything and every
a last bubble pops leaving a lake of ink with a surface smooth as glass
kafka has found his way back here rushing in
but wait which file cabinet did he come out of
hes surrounded by file cabinet drawers all alike
he starts running around pulling open drawers trying to find the secret doorway through one of them
here come the assistants running round and round
kafka runs round and round opening drawer after drawer
he finds the one
pulling it closed after him just as the assistants stumble in
they look at each other then immediately start rushing around opening drawers
they run back and forth and all around bumping into each other making themselves dizzy
pulls open a drawer oskar
turning from another ludwig
but ludwig just pulls out a file folder
this is filed incorrectly
theyre all in a dreadful muddle
they start trading files back and forth trying to put the system back in order
the attention span of squirrels theyve forgotten all about looking for kafka
the police inspector enters the main courtyard
behind him come the two secondary policemen
behind them obscurely a few more
he and his men pause reacting
as the few wretched survivors of the castle prison stagger out of the shadows to greet them
on the old town side of the river
walks slowly tiredly
he looks up at the sky but the sky is a silver shield against anyone who looks for help from it
did he hear something other than the wind and the water
he passes through a small park approaching a gate on the other side of it
mist swirling around him
he opens the gate and boo
standing there half in shadow in profile
her glorious profile
you did get away
i knew you walked this way to work
i wanted to find you before they did
ive just come from the castle
her eye glancing far away over
its only over when you can crawl to a clean little spot on earth where the sun sometimes shines and you can warm yourself a bit
kafka is beginning to sense something quite wrong with her
should i tell you why i joined our late lamented nihilists
why i became a murderer
looks at him its easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate evil once youve adopted its procedure
kafka just watches her
the breeze sings in the air
have you ever watched a person deteriorate
day by day
i dont mean in a spiritual sense
kafka doesnt answer
she turns fully to him
the other side of her beautiful face is
kafka backs away a couple of steps
only two steps back
even the man they left to guard me retreated further than that
i i found your jailer
this is the result of their elixir of youth
they were to come and check on it during the night
i contrived to miss the appointment
theyre dead now
we can get help
i know how they reward failure
if they saw this id be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon with all the others
theres a new potion he said it was perfected
i know there is
and youre what i have to bargain with
for now youre the last one in their way
i told you theyre dead its finished
why should i believe a man who never believed me
theyre absolutely right you know guilt should never be doubted
its easier that way
kafka starts to back away some more
gabriela starts to follow him
i think youve just escaped for the moment
just as i did
as eduard did
as they let us do
but only for the moment
no not this time
i know better than you what people will say when they have to
when they brought me in for questioning i informed on my friends the very first day
listen to me i do
you understand the world better than any of us kafka
and what its becoming
pause ive always held you in the highest regard
and suddenly shes slashed a knife across kafkas chest
he shouts in pain staggering backwards
she comes after him
she comes after him blade glistening
kafka does his best to run
kafka giddily staggers forward one arm wrapped around his bleeding chest gabriela close behind him
too close for him to get away
he turns to face her as he reaches the bridge and as she comes upon him again with the knife raising his arm to block the thrust and hold her
shes strong though made more so by her madness
she forces him down to the ground straddling him the knife pushing closer
kafka gasps in pain finally succumbs no longer able to hold his hand up in defense simply shutting his eyes with a terrible sigh to await the fatal stab
it doesnt come
but not quite
gabrielas arm pauses shaking in the cool cloudy air her sleeve trembling in the breeze off the river the sharp blade inches from kafkas throat flashing in the new days
gabriela stares away over the river the destroyed half of her face in shadow again the other more strikingly beautiful than ever
as kafka watches passive she gets off him and slowly walks to the wall of the bridge letting the knife drop from her hand along the way
kafka manages to lift himself to his knees clutching his wound
he looks up
gabriela in one graceful movement climbs over the wall and throws herself into the river
kafka lowers his head
quiet in here
breakfast business not as crowded as evening
kafka sits alone at his usual table
looking dazed almost in shock
mostly just tired
he sips from his coffee cup
he coughs a little into his napkin and notices blood on it
he has a pen in his hand
tapping it slowly on a newspaper on the table
bizzlebek comes into the coffee house
he sees kafka sitting in the far corner and gives a grand smile and wave
but then he notices kafkas other friends entering and hed rather not have to deal with them so he gives kafka a catch you later gesture and turns onto his
own usual stool at the bar
kafka stares at his friends over there
theyre taking off their coats and greeting other people
the girl anna is the first to start walking to join him
he starts to write a first line that has occurred to him the pen moving as if he cant help himself
kafka just watches her coming
he knows hell end up going out with her sleeping with her getting engaged to her
we see the future on kafkas face you asked me recently why i maintain that i am afraid of you
alone again in his little room kafka writes on into the night
the famous letter to his father is pages and pages long
we notice too that his chest has been bandaged
he coughs a little as he forces himself to keep writing
naturally things cannot in reality fit together the way the evidence does in my letter life is more than a chinese puzzle
but in my opinion something has been achieved which so closely approximates the truth that it might reassure us both a little and make our living and our dying easier
the assistants sit on a big packing crate brushing soot from their suits shaking dust out of their hair fiddling with the rips in their jackets and trousers
we could go back to the office
explain ourselves to the chief clerk
theyd drive us away
that kafkas made things very hot for us
i understand he was wounded in the lung
sulky it doesnt matter
its too late for all of us
