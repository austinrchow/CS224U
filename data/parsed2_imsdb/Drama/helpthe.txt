written by tate taylor based on the novel by kathryn stockett second draft november william faulkner wrote of mammy callie after her death
she gave to my family a fidelity without stint or calculation or recompense and gave to my childhood an immeasurable devotion and love
aibileen black sits at a table in a small green kitchen
she wears a yellow dress with black piping and grips a tattered spiral notebook
although cracked the window behind her is crystal clear
three framed portraits hang on the wall above her john f
martin luther king jr
and an unknown young black male wearing thick glasses
aibileen swallows hard
on piedmont plantation in cherokee county
an unseen woman interviews aibileen
did you know as a girl growing up that one day youd be a maid
and you knew that because
momma was a maid
my grandmother was a house slave
the woman repeats aibileens answer slowly as she writes
aibileen squeezes the notebook in her lap
now did you ever dream of being something else
she doesnt answer
the room is quiet
well then whats it feel like to raise a white child when your own childs at home
being looked after by somebody else
aibileens hand trembles as she sips from a glass of water
she glances sadly up to the picture of the young black male
i done raised seventeen kids in my life
lookin after white babies thats what i do
mae mobley leefolt years old lies in a crib crying
her dark black skin contrasts angelically with a brilliant white work dress white panty hose and shoes i know how to get them babies asleep stop cryin and go in
the toilet bowl before they mommas even get outta bed in the mornin
aibileen lifts mae mobley out of her crib and pulls her into her expansive bosom
babies like fat

aibileen sits with mae mobley in a rocking chair
i work from eight to four six days a week
ninety five cents an hour comes to a hundred seventy two dollars ever month
i do all the cooking cleaning washing ironing and grocery shopping but mostly i take care a baby girl
and law i worry she gone be fat

mae mobley reaches up and touches aibileens face
aibileen kisses her and whispers in her ear
you is kind
you is smart
you is important
mae mobleys mother elizabeth leefolt and lanky enters wearing a green dress very much under construction
pins and double stick tape hold it all together
elizabeth has pointed features and a nest of teased brittle hair
aibileen bridge clubs in an hour
did you finish the chicken salad
oh and hillys deviled eggs
elizabeth rotates around like the tin man
does this dress look homemade
i reckon when you finish it wont
elizabeth exits with her pinned hemline sloping at a good twenty degree angle
aibileen shakes her head
miss leefolt still dont pick baby girl up but once a day
the birthin blues had got holt a miss leefolt pretty hard
i done seen it happen plenty a times
once babies start havin they own babies
and the young white ladies of jackson
oh law they was havin some babies
a smoking receptionist leads eugenia skeeter phelan across a smoke filled news office
even the light bulbs have yellowed
but not miss skeeter
skeeter has very frizzy blond hair cut short above her shoulders
she carries a red satchel
and not lookin
she wears flats careful not to add more than a centimeter to her towering height
dressed well skeeter tugs on her unfamiliar attire
the receptionist and skeeter enter the office of mr
he has greased grey hair and the face of a mean man
smoke pours into the room
shut the goddamn door
he snaps his fingers over a chair
skeeter sits down
they announced last week cigarettesll kill you
blackly pours a pack of nuts into his mouth
okay lets see what you got
skeeter quickly hands mr
blackly a resume
he skims it over marking it violently with a red pen
murrah high editor ole miss rebel rouser editor double major junior league editor
damn girl didnt you have any fun
blackly sighs hands the resume back to skeeter
you got any references
skeeter nods slowly
she takes a deep breath and pulls a letter out of her satchel
she hands it to mr
blackly snatches the letter and reads it quickly mouthing the words as he does
he drops the letter on his desk and looks to skeeter flabbergasted
is a rejection letter
skeeters face flushes hot and quick
missus stein stein
skeeter points toward the letterhead
elaine stein senior editor at harper and row publishing
in new york
im going to be a serious writer mr
so when i applied to harper and row missus she told you no
until i gain some experience mr
see it says it right there at the end

blackly pours the rest of the peanuts in his mouth
i guess youll do

blackly sees cigarette smoke bleeding under his door
blackly pulls up a box filled with letters and newspapers
he slams it down in front of skeeter
miss myrnas gone shit house crazy on us drunk hair spray or something

skeeter forces a smile
you know who miss myrna is
i read her articles all the time

blackly picks up the phone and starts yelling at someone
skeeter excitedly grabs the box of letters and leaves
hilly holbrook white and hefty sits on a closed toilet seat in a well appointed bathroom
shes covered in red plaid and bows and has a round face topped by a perfect beehive
were late for bridge
hilly carefully rolls toilet paper out from its holder
she raises a pencil and places the tiniest dot imaginable on the first and second sheets of paper
miss hilly was the first of the babies to have a baby
and it must a come out of her like the eleventh commandment
cause once miss hilly had a baby ever girl at the bridge table wanted one too
she carefully rolls the paper back up in the roll
go get momma
minny jackson black plump and in uniform rolls her eyes beneath a crystal chandelier
she shouts up the mahogany stairwell
you need help coming down
missus walters passes quietly behind minny
minny jumps with a yelp spins around
gone give me a heart attack
missus walters ambles toward the closet door
minny quickly tries to turn her toward the front door
missus walters resists
minny im getting my coat
missus walters opens the closet
its ninety degrees out there missus walters
missus walters pulls out a red wool coat with cheetah print collar
the early stages of alzheimers have appeared but missus walters is still quite proud at eighty percent capacity
once missus walters arteries went hard miss hilly moved her and minny in with her
fired the maid she had just to make room
see minny about the best cook in mississippi and miss hilly wanted her
hillys approach is marked by the whishing sound of her plaid fat thighs
she nonchalantly grabs the coat from her mother and carries it out the door
minny and missus walters follow
minny carries a chocolate pie
hilly barks over her shoulder
minny william took billy out for ice cream
so hurry back and get billy down for his nap
no dilly dallying
minny raises the pie behind hillys beehive dreaming of smashing it into her head
minny my best friend
a old lady like me lucky to have her
aibileen kneels next to mae mobley who sits on a small childrens training toilet
its a tricky thing
you try to make a baby go in the toilet bowl before its time
if theys cant get the hang of it theys get to thinking low a theyselves
mae mobley sticks her lip out
you drunk up two glasses a grape juice i know you got to tee tee
mae mobley shakes her head
i give you a cookie if you go
tee tee immediately sprinkles into the bowl
aibileen and mae mobley laugh excitedly as elizabeth storms into the bathroom in her finished dress
the hemline now slants in the other direction
aibileen the girls are pulling up and the table isnt set
mae mobley go momma
get in your room
mae mobley rises behind aibileens leg
elizabeth reaches down and scoops up mae mobley like a sack of potatoes
mae mobley looks to aibileen over her mothers shoulder her eyes have welled up
aibileen mouths i love you and blows her a kiss
the leefolts small wood paneled two bedroom ranch is destined to become income property one day
five young women early s and elizabeth hover around two collapsible card tables arranged in the living room
aibileen methodically arranges grapes on a platter of chicken salad resting on elizabeths dining table
the table has a small l shaped crack in the middle
i lost my own boy treelore right before i started waitin on the leefolts
elizabeth glances anxiously to the dining table then catches eyes with aibileen nodding ever so slightly
aibileen carefully slides the platter over the l shaped crack making sure its hidden
after treelore died a bitter seed was planted inside a me
and i just didnt feel so accepting anymore
hilly enters the front door holding missus walters coat
minny follows behind holding the pie and missus walters arm
over her shoulder put momma in a chair before she breaks a hip
im not deaf yet hilly
minny spies aibileen in the corner and gives her a here we go look as she lowers missus walters into a chair
hilly approaches aibileen with the coat
aibileen i want you to have this coat
its too big for momma now and its way too expensive to put in the coat drive
hilly extends the coat with a smile
aibileen takes the coat
thank you miss hilly
try it on
minny plows through the swing door and reaches for hillys deviled eggs
aibileen rushes in behind her wearing the cheetah collared coat
the sleeves are about a foot too short
those are miss hillys
aibileen pulls another plate of eggs out of the fridge
gots to have paprika on em
minny takes an egg
it disappears in a single bite
forgive me lord but im gonna have to kill that woman
aibileen removes the coat and lays it over a chair
watch yo mouth minny
looks like a walking christmas present with all them bows
aibileen shakes with silent laughter
and now she gone to puttin pencil marks on the toilet paper
but i carry paper in from my own damn house
that fool dont know
elizabeth and hilly cackle with a group of girls as missus walters sits on the couch watching guiding light
skeeter suddenly rushes through the front door
jolene french approaches and hugs skeeter
well if it isnt long haul skeeter
we didnt think youd ever leave ole miss
well its supposed to take four years jolene
skeeter spins around to hilly and elizabeth with a sigh
sorry im late
i had to stop by the cleaners and pick up my black dress
hilly and elizabeth look at skeeter with concern
about supper club tonight
honey stuart had to cancel
hilly places her hand on skeeters shoulder
he cant get off the rig skeeter
stuart is a very successful oil man
im starting to think this stuart is a figment of your imagination
raleigh called his cousin down in hattiesburg
hell drive up
the cousin with one eye
i guess his black patch will match my dress
just forget it
skeeter storms off
hilly glares at elizabeth
aibileen clears the dining table as bridge begins
hilly elizabeth and skeeter sit with jolene
skeeter takes a deep breath and belts out her news
i got a job today
at the jackson journal
everyone looks at skeeter as if she just threw up on herself
finally hilly pats skeeter on the leg
theyd be a fool not to hire you
jolene raises her glass
and her job
last stop til marriage
hilly kicks jolene under the table
the miss myrna column
have yall read it
but i bet the poor girls without any help in south jackson read it like the king james
skeeters forehead crinkles
elizabeth would you mind if i talk to aibileen
to help me answer some of the letters
just until i get a knack for it
aibileen clears dishes as if she hasnt heard a thing
elizabeth gets very still
what cant you just get constantine to help you
skeeter looks to her lap and shakes her head
oh my gosh
skeeter nods her head sadly
im so sorry skeeter
i really dont want to talk about it
the girls nod
i dont know how to answer these letters
elizabeth looks to aibileen
i mean as long as it doesnt interfere with her work
a phone rings
elizabeth nods to aibileen
aibileen rushes in the kitchen and answers the phone
pink fuzzy slippers anchoring bare sexy legs stand on a black and white check floor
hello is elizabeth in
rising up a slim torso sizeable cleavage bursts out of a pink robes collar
she having bridge club right now
may i take a message
celia foote peroxide blonde stands in all her country girl glory
she speaks with a thick unrefined southern accent mired in insecurity
please tell her celia foote called again
ill call back tomorrow
celia nervously twists herself around in the phone cord
miss strikes aibileen as very odd
im looking for some help at my house
you know any maids looking
celia hands up the phone with a frown and sips from a coca cola bottle
aibileen enters the living room with a coffee pot
who was that on the phone
miss celia foote called again
elizabeth leans over and touches hillys arm
ive never called her back hilly
she cant take a hint can she
whos celia foote
that tacky girl johnny married
i heard shes twenty eight
oh my god
uh hmm worked concessions at a lsu game and sold him a hotdog
and boy he got a whole lot more
all the girls laugh
could have been you hilly
and live thirty minutes outside of town
anyway i ran into her at the beauty parlor and she had the nerve to ask if she could help with the childrens benefit
arent we taking non members
the benefits gotten so big
yes but were not telling her
everyone laughs but skeeter
aibileen pours skeeter a cup of coffee
skeeter looks up decidedly and smiles
thank you aibileen
hilly begins squirming in her seat obviously making a point
elizabeth leans over
oh hilly i wish youd just go use the bathroom
missus walters shouts out from the sofa
shes upset cause the nigra uses the guest bath and so do we
elizabeth turns to aibileen
aibileen go check on mae mobley
elizabeth leans into hilly
just go use mine and raleighs
hilly hiss whispers
if aibileen uses the guest bathroom im sure she uses yours too
aibileen turns the corner in the hall and stops
wouldnt you rather them take their business outside
skeeter sees a reflection of aibileen listening off of a picture in the hall
skeeter tries to change the subject
did yall see the cover of life this week
jackies never looked tell raleigh every penny he spends on a coloreds bathroom hell get back in spades when yall sell
its just plain dangerous
everybody knows they carry different diseases than we do
elizabeth takes a puff of her cigarette and fidgets with her cards
i cant ask raleigh until tax season
but it would be nice
thats why ive drafted the home help sanitation initiative
as a disease preventative bill that requires every white home to have a separate bathroom for the colored help
ive even notified the surgeon general of mississippi
skeeter again glances at aibileen
their eyes meet
maybe we ought to just build you a bathroom outside hilly
the room grows eerily quiet
you ought not to joke about the colored situation
hilly leans in toward skeeter
ill do whatever it takes to protect our town
your lead jolene
jolene suddenly looks to a wall clock
she jumps up and throws her cards to the table
i have to skedaddle
gotta get over to the station
daddys letting me do the weather tonight
celia delicately prunes two rosebushes
her long pink fingernails wrap easily around a pair of sheers
as celia stands back to admire her work we widen to see the foote estate
ancient oaks dripping in spanish moss surround a perfectly manicured lawn
tara pales in comparison
oddly the two rosebushes have been planted in the center of the lawn jeopardizing the antebellum feng shui
now miss celia had her a man
bout the best lookin man in all of mississippi
but no baby and no friends
johnny foote celias ridiculously handsome husband sneaks up behind her as he removes his jacket and tie
roses look like weeds next to you
celia turns with a yelp
she slaps him playfully
johnny you scared the daylights out of me
johnny begins kissing her neck
youre home early
celia pushes him back
johnny i cant get any of your old friends from school to call me back
oh who cares honey
we got all we need right here
johnny kisses her again and lowers her to the grass
johnny starts kissing celias breasts
she becomes uneasy and rolls out from under him
i dont know whats taking us so long
johnny brushes hair from celias face
hey weve never done it in the yard
maybe thats the trick
celia seductively bites her lower lip
watch my hair
johnnys hand slides up her thigh
bridge over skeeter smokes while watching through a window as minny arrives in hillys car
skeeter blows smoke toward hilly and elizabeth saying good bye
a sermon plays over an old am radio nestled between canisters of sugar and flour
aibileen enters with a stack of dirty coffee cups
aibileen becomes nervous at the sight of skeeter alone
i had hoped to ask you myself if you could help me with the miss myrna letters
would you help me
aibileen nods and looks out to elizabeth on the street
miss myrna gets it wrong lotta times
be good to get it right
thank you aibileen
i plan on splitting the pay with you too
aibileen doesnt respond
she grabs a basket of rolls
all that talk in there today
hillys talk i mean
im sorry you had to hear that
aibileen quickly turns her back to skeeter
a gospel choir begins singing on the radio
is that preacher greens sermon on the radio
yes maam it is
that reminds me so much of my maid growing up
aibileen starts wiping down a serving tray
constantine and me
were in church circle together
skeeter turns to aibileen as she puts out her cigarette
she loved me like you love mae mobley
skeeter moves closer to aibileen
how could she just quit like that
aibileen stops wiping and looks up to skeeter
when i got home from school last week momma said she had quit
back in march to go live with her people up in chicago
she didnt leave me a note or anything
aibileen turns and resumes wiping the tray
could you do that to mae mobley
aibileen slowly turns back to skeeter
do you have an address for her or anything
aibileen shrugs her shoulders reeling it all back in
just then elizabeth walks into the kitchen holding papers stapled together
she looks between aibileen and skeeter
did i interrupt something
skeeter and aibileen shake their heads
elizabeth hands skeeter the papers
home help sanitation initiative is written on the cover
hilly wants this put in the league newsletter
aibileen ill drop by at ten tomorrow to get started on miss myrna
elizabeth looks at aibileen
tomorrow is silver polishing day so yall make it quick okay
skeeter speeds down a country road lined with ancient oak trees in a white cadillac
i knew i had said too much to miss skeeter but constantines story werent mine to tell
some things a girl shouldnt have to know about her own mother
her frizzy hair swirls about as she passes a truck full of cotton
skeeter looks ahead and sees an older black woman walking with a little blonde girl
they hold hands
the black woman smiles and waves as skeeter passes
when skeeter looks in her rear view mirror theyre gone
skeeter suddenly stops the car just short of an intersecting gravel road
skeeter slowly turns down the old road
skeeters car pulls into the overgrown yard of an old shack with a rusted out tin roof
two clapboard rooms are separated by an open breezeway
the front door is cracked opened
skeeter gets out and walks toward constantines home
skeeter enters to find only a small bed dresser table rocking chair and a wood burning stove
past intruders have long since taken anything of value
as skeeter approaches constantines bed an opossum scurries out from underneath
skeeter screams as the opossum runs out the door
her eyes suddenly catch something
lying on the bed is an old corn pipe
skeeter picks it up and brings it to her face
her eyes begin to well up
skeeter pulls in front of a grand antebellum home and parks to the side of her familys graveyard
skeeter carries her black dress up the stairs of a covered porch
an old black man with white hair jameso tightens a porch swing
hello miss eugenia
skeeter walks through the front door
if the smithsonian had wished to assemble the perfect antebellum home skeeter would be standing in it
skeeter enters and looks around curiously at an array of wigs resting atop a dresser
skeeters mother charlotte boudreau cantelle phelan glides into the room wearing a wig
her floral print dress has a gazillion perfectly pressed pleats
charlotte turns to a mirror and adjusts an auburn colored pixie cut
is this a little too young
its a little too everything
charlotte removes the wig with a sigh
only now do we realize her decision to wear wigs isnt elective
thinning hair detracts from her perfectly made up face
charlotte puts on a classic bouffant flip in dark brown
your daddy bought me this dress in
mom i want to ask you about right after ole miss won the sugar bowl
charlotte unzips the dress and takes it off
come on you try it on
what really happened
charlotte winces with pain and grasps her stomach
i told you
she went to live with her people in chicago
now skeeter your mother is dying and she wants to see you in this dress
charlotte stands in her slip and bra holding the dress
skeeter begins taking off her clothes
how could she just take off without telling me
i told her not to write you
i didnt want you upset in the middle of final exams
honey we were just a job to her
with them its all about money
did i tell you fanny peatrow got engaged
after she got that teller job her mother said she was just swimming in proposals
good for fat fanny peatrow
she lowers the dress over skeeters head and zips it
this looks precious on you
four years ago my daughter went off to college and what did she come home with
a pretty piece of paper
hilly and elizabeth have such lovely children
they dropped out of college to become housewives mother
if only youd show a little gumption eugenia
well i did get a job today
for the jackson journal
charlotte plumps up the dress around skeeters behind
you can write my obituary
charlotte phelan dead
her daughter still single
momma would it really be so terrible if i never met a husband
with that charlotte grabs skeeters hand and takes her to a love seat
this is serious
i need to
ask you something skeeter
i read the other day about how some girls
get unbalanced start thinking these
well unnatural thoughts
charlotte begins to twist the handkerchief she holds
find men attractive
are you having unnatural thoughts about
charlotte shuts her eyes tight
oh my god
because this article says theres a cure a special root tea
skeeter jumps up
mother i want to be with girls as much as you wanna be with jameso
skeeter storms out of the room
carltons bringing rebecca to dinner
try to look presentable
the phelan dining room is lit solely by candles
the phelans new maid pascagolua rolls a cart of casseroles around the table
charlotte sits at the head of the table
shes having a bowl of broth
skeeter sits next to her father robert phelan
skeeters brother carlton sits next to his fiance rebecca
theyre perfectly groomed with hollywood good looks
what the hell do you know about cleaning a house skeeter
its a start carlton
i thought you wanted to write books
leave your sister alone son
im proud of you sweetheart
charlotte scoops up some broth with a spoon
oh the irony of it all
givin advice on how to keep up a home when she
charlottes spoon goes in her mouth
pascagolua tries to scoop some sort of casserole covered in almonds onto skeeters plate
skeeter stops her
you couldnt have known this
but see im allergic to almonds
sorry miss eugenia
last time i had an almond i stopped liking men
charlotte glares at skeeter
carlton lets out a chuckle
rebecca is mortified
oh my lord
its okay rebecca
they have a special root tea now
you have pushed it young lady
pascagolua scurries off
skeeter turns to her father
daddy what happened to constantine
the room grows silent
carlton looks down to his plate
well constantine went to live with her family
people move on skeeter
but i do wish shed stayed down here with us
i dont believe you
skeeter looks to her mother who immediately busies herself with scooping up more broth
mother did you
you wouldnt understand
not until youve hired help of your own
she raised me
charlotte slaps the table and stands
skeeters eyes fill with tears
she worked here for twenty nine years
charlotte presses both hands to her stomach
it was a colored thing and ive put it behind me
charlotte passes behind rebecca and kisses her head
excuse me rebecca
my daughter has upset my cancerous ulcers
as charlotte leaves the room rebecca looks at skeeter like shes the worst person on earth
skeeter gets up and storms off into the entry foyer
skeeter and lanky wears a party dress
despite a tight bun her strong willed hair has started to frizz
skeeters father and brother race down the stairs with suitcases
carlton wears a varsity sweater
good luck down there carlton
have fun at the dance skeeter legs
robert and carlton race outside as charlotte enters healthy and glowing
youve grown another inch since breakfast
go put on a dress that fits before that boy and his daddy come pick you up
a horn blows
charlotte kisses skeeter on the cheek and then looks over to constantine
constantine stands tall
her skin is black as night
her eyes have a striking honey colored hue to them
she wears a white sleeping gown
pray carlton doesnt like lsu constantine
its so far
it might be the last we see of him
the horn blows again
charlotte is out the door
skeeter turns to constantine who is all smiles
gone be just you and me all weekend
skeeter sits at a picnic table smoking a cigarette
constantine smokes tobacco out of a corn pipe
i just couldnt tell her i didnt get asked to the dance
some things we should just keep to ourselves
skeeter looks down to her long bony legs
im already taller than the boys basketball coach
how tall are you constantine
im five thirteen so quit feeling sorry for yourself
momma was third runner up in the miss south carolina pageant
you gone be miss something better
constantine grabs skeeters hand and presses her thumb firmly to her palm
now you listen
your momma didnt pick her life
it pick her and she done even know it
you gone do something big with yours
bigger than your momma or your brother
constantine lets go of skeeters palm and wipes a tear from her face
what about you
what did you want to be constantine
we dont get to pick
this pick us and that just how it is
tight on skeeters face as constantine gives her a big hug
skeeter lies in bed staring holes into the ceiling as a rooster announces the morning
a sudden revelation washes over her
in a flash skeeter is out of bed and running down the stairs
pascagoula tends to a skillet full of eggs next to a black and white tv resting on the counter
jolene french attempts to deliver the weather on wlbt
sunny skies and a high of ninety eight today with ninety nine percent humidity
theres a slight chance of afternoon showers so yall carry an umbrella
jolene pivots to camera lowers her chin and smiles
skeeter runs past pascagoula with a phone and disappears inside the pantry
elaine stein hard but stylish talks on the phone in a large corner office
she lights a cigarette and swivels her chair toward the manhattan skyline
what gave you this idea miss phelan
skeeter sits on a huge sack of flour
a millenniums supply of can goods fills the shelves
well i was raised by a colored woman
ive seen how simple it can be and
well how complex it can be too
between the families and the help
id like to write something from the point of view of the help
these colored women raise white children and then twenty years later those children become the employer
its that irony miss stein that we love them and they love us yet
we dont even let them use the toilet in the house
miss steins swivels her chair back around and sits up
margaret mitchell glorified the mammy figure who dedicates her whole life to a white family but no one
ever asked mammy how she felt about it
there is both undisguised hate for white women and an inexplicable love but nobody ever talks about it down here
so a side to this never before heard
charlotte knocks on the pantry door
skeeter who are you talking to in there
skeeter covers the mouth piece and opens the door
skeeter slams the door
so yes their side of the story
skeeter leans back against the shelves
who was that
she just dropped by to look no maid in her right mind would ever tell you the truth
thats a hell of a risk in a place like jackson mississippi
i watched them try to integrate your bus station on the news
they jammed fifty five negroes in a jail built for four
i already have a maid
skeeter cant believe what just came out of her mouth
miss stein rises and sits on the edge of her desk
a negro maid has already agreed to talk to you
skeeter blinks hard
no turning back now
i suppose i could read what you come up with
the book biz could use a little rattling
youd do that
im saying ill let you know if its even worth pursuing
oh thank you miss stein
and for gods sake youre a twenty four year old educated woman
go get an apartment
she hangs up
skeeter sits across the table from aibileen reading the miss myrna letters
outside winds howl and the sky grows dark
jolenes forecast appears to be a bit off
dear miss myrna how do i remove the rings from my fat slovenly husbands shirt collar when he is such a pig and sweats like one too
which one she want a get rid of
them rings or the husband
skeeter chuckles and shrugs her shoulders
tell her a vinegar and pine sol soak
then let it set in the sun a bit
skeeter writes this down
bout an hour
let it dry
skeeter keeps writing
aibileen notices something outside
hilly walks into the leefolt backyard with her son billy perched on her hip
a contractor s follows holding a set of plans
skeeter turns to the open window
its already started to sprinkle outside
build it just like the one at my house right against the garage
the contractor nods
lightning strikes thunder cracks
hilly is off and running with billy
skeeter seizes the moment
aibileen do you ever wish you could
aibileen turns slowly from the window
i mean all that talk yesterday and now with what hillys up to
aibileens eyes fall to the floor
my momma fired constantine
thank you for telling me that
i never tolt you that
aibileen jumps up as another crack of thunder sounds out
aibileen i have an idea
something i want to write about
but i need your help
i want to interview you
about what it is like to work as a maid
aibileen stops at the refrigerator gripping the life out of its handle
id like to do a book of interviews about working for white families
show what its like to work for say
aibileen begins to perspire
she grabs the counter to steady herself then moves toward her chair
you know whatd happen to me if miss leefolt knew i was tellin stories on her
i was thinking we wouldnt tell her
the other maids will have to keep it secret too
i was hoping to get four or five
to really show what its like in jackson
to see what yall get paid the babies the bathrooms the good and the bad
aibileen shakes her head
they set my cousin shinelles car on fire just cause she went down to the voting station
a book has never been written like this aibileen
cause theys a reason
i do this with you i might as well burn my own house down
the front door slams shut
soaking wet elizabeth and her husband raleigh stand toe to toe
i put up with the new clothes and all the damn trips to new orleans but this takes the goddamn cake
itll confuse mae mobley if she sees aibileen going inside
and we cant risk her health
aibileen hears mae mobley crying but she is frozen
hilly spoke to the surgeon general
she also said itll add value to our home
mae mobley can just go to college in that bathroom too
honey hillys covering the cost
and said you can just do williams taxes to pay her back
we dont take orders from the holbrooks
raleigh storms in and is surprised to see skeeter
how you doing
fix me a sandwich aibileen
raleigh storms out as elizabeth charges into the kitchen
aibileen mae mobleys crying her eyes out
aibileen runs off
elizabeth sees skeeter and tries to compose herself
im sorry but i think its best if you leave now
skeeter gathers her things
i dont think this miss myrna thing is gonna work out with aibileen
the storm has escalated
the holbrook house is without power
hilly runs around lighting candles
missus walters lies on the couch while minny fans her with a newspaper
youre making it a lot hotter flapping your arm like that
minny stops and begins squirming with discomfort
missus walters notices her looking out to the garage bathroom
leaves blow across the yard
hilly plops down in a chair with a candle
that should do it
minny go get me and momma some iced tea
as minny turns missus walters calls out to her
you go on ahead and use the guest bath minny
oh for crying out loud
its just a little rain
she can go get an umbrella up in williams study
i believe she was working for me before you dragged us both here
minny looks outside just as wind slams an aluminum lawn chair against the garage bathroom
another crash of thunder
large hail stones begin falling in the yard
im gone get your tea
minny sneaks into the guest bath with a candle and shuts the door
she carefully lowers the seat and sits
relief spreads across her face
theres a knock on the door
minny panics staying completely quiet
hilly leans into the bathroom door
minnyyyy are you in there
are you sitting down
minny gets up quickly and flushes the toilet
hilly beats on the door
outside the house an eerie groaning sound much like a freight train intensifies
the top of a huge tree snaps off and falls against the house shattering a window
minny crouches down and covers her head
a draft sucks the candles flame toward the bottom of the door
aibileen sits with mae mobley against an interior wall holding a mattress on top of them and humming in her ear
on top a minny losin her tenth job eighteen people died in jackson that day
skeeter stands in her backyard facing jackson
cool winds head toward the dark swirling horizon
in the distance lightning strikes
celia leans on the porch railing gazing helplessly as the relentless hail storm pummels her two rosebushes
god dont pay no mind to color or class once he sets a tornado loose
within seconds the rose blossoms are gone
aibileen uses the newly completed bathroom hilly has built in the garage
the walls consist of unpainted plywood with a small window hugging the ceiling
beads of sweat glisten on aibileens forehead under a single bulb hanging above
soon after that bitter seed inside of me had sprout and was growing fast
well into her second pregnancy elizabeth exits the house with mae mobley at her side
she wears an awful homemade maternity dress
mae mobleys up and im off to the doctor
aibileen reaches behind and flushes the toilet
mae mobley gets excited and points to the garage bathroom
aibee bafroom momma
mae mobley walks toward the bathroom and calls out
elizabeth grabs her and forces her down on the back step
be right there baby girl
aibileen pulls up her panty hose
aibileen waits with yule may as well as other maids and black males at a bus stop
yule may is tall pretty and graceful
her hair is pulled tightly into a bun
skeeter walks down the sidewalk toward them
she and aibileen catch eyes
yule may inches away from aibileen
one black man in particular looks with concern as skeeter walks up
aibileen nods nervously looking at the other domestics
can i talk to you
a bus pulls up
you got some miss myrna questions for me
yule may and others board
skeeter grabs aibileens arm
aibileen signals to yule may to go on ahead without her
the bus pulls away
please let me interview you
i know its scary but i really believe this has to be done
well be careful
this already aint careful miss skeeter
you not knowing that is what scares me most
skeeter hands aibileen a piece of paper with her phone number written on it
aibileen turns and walks off down the sidewalk
dark outside aibileen approaches another more integrated bus stop
i know pretty well what happens if the white ladies found out we was writing about them
womens they aint like men
women don t beat you with a stick
naw they like to keep they hands clean
got a shiny set a tools they use sharp as witches fingernails
as aibileen ambles toward a bench two white women in nurse uniforms push in front of her and sit
skeeter sits at a long table surrounded by books piled high as if to provide a shield of sorts
lying before her is an old thin onionskin booklet curling at the edges
its titled compilation of jim crow laws of the south skeeter opens the booklet and begins reading
any person printing publishing or circulating written matter urging for public acceptance of social equality between whites and negroes is subject to imprisonment
aibileen sits at a table wearing a nightgown
she carefully combs and styles her wig for work in the morning
her real hair is bound tightly in dozens of tightly bound nubs
the rotary wall phone rings
aibileen hangs the wig on her chair and answers
minny is hysterical
i went and did it now
minny wraps a hand up in the phone cord
miss hilly been tellin everbody in town i stole a candelabra
thats why i cant get no job
everbody know you honest minny
oh but i got her back
i did something awful aibileen
what you did
minny stands on hillys porch holding a chocolate pie
i caint tell
i aint tellin nobody
i done a terrible awful thing to that woman
and now she knows what i did
hilly answers the door and snarls at minny
minny presents the pie and says i am sorry
hilly waves minny inside
she got what she deserve aibileen
but now i aint gone never get no work again
leroy gone kill me
minnys husband leroy approaches behind minny
minny slowly turns
aibileen hears a loud slap and minnys phone dropping to the floor
yelling and screaming follows
she cant bear to listen and hangs up the phone
she sees skeeters phone number taped to the wall
aibileens breath becomes heavy
anger wells inside her
she picks up the phone again and begins to dial
wearing a black scarf over her hair and clutching her red satchel skeeter approaches a small one story wood structure
white paint peels hydrangeas fill the yard
skeeter spies an old pickup truck parked on the side of aibileens house completely covered in years of dust
skeeter checks over her shoulder several times
the porch steps creak under her big feet
aibileen quickly opens the door and waves her inside
aibileen wears the same yellow dress she wore in the first scene
i parked way up on state street and caught a cab here like you asked
got dropped two streets over
aibileen i now know its against the law for us to meet like this
skeeter stares aibileen up and down
aibileen self consciously flattens our her dress
ive never seen you out of uniform before
you look nice aibileen
aibileen motions for skeeter to sit on a narrow sofa behind a coffee table covered in hand tatted lace
a tray holds a teapot two cups that dont match and cookies resting on folded napkins
as aibileen pours the tea her hand shakes
ive never had a white person in my house before
skeeter sips her tea
ive never been in a colored persons home before
i think were both doing great
this tea is really nice
aibileen watches as skeeter takes a bite of the cookie
miss skeeter what if
what if you dont like what i got to say
about white peoples
this isnt about my opinion
it doesnt matter how i feel
you gone have to change my name
mine miss leefolts everbodys
so you know other maids who might be interested
aibileen is quiet for a moment
she shakes her head
it gone be hard
what about minny
minny got her some stories sho nuff
but she aint real keen on talking to white peoples right now
we continue with the interview seen on page one
what does it feel like to raise a white child when your own childs at home being
looked after by somebody else
aibileen glances up to the framed picture of treelore
is that your son
he dead two years now
got run over at the lumber yard
lungs were crushed
im so sorry
and aibileen you dont have to call me maam
not here anyway
skeeter stares at her list of questions
do you want to talk about the bathroom
or about elizab miss leefolt
anything about the way she pays you
has she ever yelled at you in front of mae mobley
aibileen shakes her head
im sorry i aibileen covers her mouth with her hand
skeeter becomes disgusted with herself
no i am
she pulls out a stack of miss myrna letters
lets just do a couple of miss myrna letters and ill run on
i thought i might write my stories down and read them to you
well sure i guess
it no different than writing down my prayers
you dont say your prayers aloud
prayer like electricity
it keep life going
writing it down make it more powerful
lot a ailing sick peoples in this town
i didnt get a chance to pray for treelore
god took him fast cause he didnt want to argue with me
he was just twenty four years old
the best part of a persons life
but hed like wes doing this
he always said we gone have a writer in the family one day
after my prayers last night i got some stories down too
aibileen opens her notebook and reads
my first white baby to ever look after was named alton carrington speers
it was and id just turned fourteen years old
daddy had left us so i dropped out a school to help momma with the bills
a congregation of three hundred stand singing lively with the large choir
aibileen stands next to yule may and is whispering in her ear
yule suddenly leans back shocked shaking her head no
minny watches from two pews back
her curiosity is peaked
altons momma died a lung disease
i loved that baby and he loved me
thats when i learned i could make children feel proud of theyselves
miss stein sits at her desk reading aibileens stories
alton used to always be asking me how come is black
it just ate him up so one time i told him it cause i drank too much coffee
oh law you should a seen his face
skeeter laughs as she writes down aibileens story
this is great
you have no idea how much i appreciate this
but i just have to ask
what changed your mind
miss hilly holbrook
hilly stands at a podium banging a gavel
the pleats of her navy blue sailors number fan out like an accordion
a room full of junior league members sits up and quiets down
half the girls are pregnant and most all drink tab and are smoking
skeeter sits in the back next to elizabeth
were running behind on our coat drive girls
so hurry up and clean out those closets
but our christmas benefit however is right on schedule as yall have already filled all our baked goods raffle slots
the girls applaud turning to each other with praise
yall think we can put a dent in the african childrens hunger this year
those who arent pregnant stand
elizabeth nudges skeeter out of her chair
now for some exciting news
i wanted yall to be the first to know
my william is seeking election to the state senate this november
now even the pregnant women stand
elizabeth grabs skeeters arm and pulls herself up
hes runnin on a platform of health
protecting our children
protecting our way of life
so i with william have drafted the home health sanitation initiative
this sets off a room of whispers
skeeter when can we expect to see the initiative in the newsletter
i gave it to you a month ago
everyone turns to skeeter
i gave that to you myself
well i would you please stand skeeter
as skeeter rises several women shake their heads
ill have it in there soon
skeeter glances at the initiative tucked in her satchel
skeeter turns a corner and sees hilly leaning on her car
do you need a ride
hilly shakes her head with little emotion
im sorry about the newsletter
a soft smile begins to form
with momma being sick and hilly erupts with excitement
oh skeeter hes definitely coming this time
this saturday night
oh hilly hes cancelled twice before
maybe its a sign
dont you dare say that
you know i wont be his type
hilly grabs skeeter by the shoulders
its your time skeeter
and damnit im not going to let you miss this just because your mother convinced you youre not good enough for somebody like him
minny is again wearing her maids uniform
she puts two plates of food down on the kitchen table
she sits next to her daughter sugar
sugar wears a brand spanking new maidss uniform
eat up girl
miss woodras like to not feed ya on try out day
sugar takes a bite of toast
i still say youre too young to be waitin on white peoples
now sugar i want you to listen to me and you listen to me good
minny grabs sugars face and looks her right in the eyes
these are the rules for working in a white ladys house
sugar jerks her face away and sticks her lip out
rule number one dont you ever let white lady find you sittin on her toilet
number two you keep your nose out of white ladys problems and dont cry to her with yours
white people aint your friends
minny steps off a bus and walks down an old country road
number three when youre cooking white food taste it with a different spoon
they see you put the tasting spoon back in the pot might as well throw it all out
minny approaches the foote estate
she stops just short of stairs leading up to the front porch
four you use the same cup same fork same plate every day
minny takes her first step on the stairs
five dont hit her kids
white people do they own spanking
minny slowly raises her hand to knock on the front door
six no sass mouthing
number six minny
the door flies open
celia foote answers
shes covered in tight pink clothes
flour covers her face and hair
im celia rae foote

minny enters behind celia gawking at the flour massacre
what in the hell minny catches herself

minny and celia enter a huge dining room
minny gawks at a dusty mahogany table surrounded by twelve chairs
johnnys momma wouldnt let me decorate a thing
if i had my way this house would have wall to wall white carpet with gold trim and none of this old stuff
minny spies a framed battle worn confederate flag complete with bullet holes
where you from
celia lowers her head in shame
its near memphis
i know sugar ditch

celia changes the subject
lets go meet oscar
celia grabs minnys hand
annoyed minny pulls it away
minny stands at the base of a massive stuffed grizzly bear
it clears the twelve foot ceiling by an inch
johnnys granddaddy shot him up in montana back in with teddy roosevelt
celia points to fifteen guns mounted behind oscar
we got five bedrooms and bathrooms here in the main house
the pool house has two more beds and baths

celia swallows hard
she places her hand on her stomach

celia slumps her shoulders as she looks around the house
i know its an awful lot to do

celia throws her arms around her

celia bites her pinky nail

minny sniffs the air

celia grabs a rag off the sink and jerks the cake out of the oven
she drops the burnt cake on the floor
you cant use no wet towel on a hot pan
minny grabs a dry towel and picks up the cake
ill take this burnt up cake with me so mister johnny dont see it
aibileen removes mae mobleys wet cloth diaper on a changing table
mae mobleys behind is covered with inflamed diaper rash
aibileen shakes her head
elizabeth enters the room
im off aibileen
dont forget raleigh wants pot roast tonight
aibileens eyes narrow
skeeter works with a typewriter now
aibileen more casually dressed than before waits for skeeter to finish typing
i reckon im ready

skeeter stops typing and looks up
baby girl dont get her diaper changed til i get there in the morning
thats bout ten hours she gots to sit in her mess

i always come in an hour early on mondays
charlotte sits at a table sorting through mail as skeeter enters and grabs an apple miss leefolt pregnant again too
and law i pray this child turn out good
it a lonely road if a momma dont think theys child is pretty
charlotte glances down disapprovingly at the dingy huarache shoes on skeeters feet
skeeter heads for the door
where are you going skeeter
on a saturday night
momma god doesnt care what day of the week it is
skeeter walks out the back door as charlotte shakes her head
hilly elizabeth and jolene french stand with hillys contractor
he unrolls a set of bathroom plans
hilly and elizabeth look to jolene and nod approvingly
skeeters typing slows
miss leefolt be spending so much time keeping up with the society ladies she done forgot the child she got now
just then minny barges through the kitchen back door
minny stops cold in her tracks at the sight of skeeter
yule may told me what yall up to
minnys face hardens
medgar evers live five minutes away
they blew up his carport last night
minny scowls at skeeter
what makes you think colored people need your help
why you care

maybe you just want to get her in trouble
skeeter is petrified
her face reddens
i want to show her perspective
so people might understand what its like from your side
well its a real fourth of july picnic
its what we dream a doing all weekend long get back in they house to polish the silver
and we just love not getting minimum wage or social security
i know minny

and i dont care a thing about votin
only thing black mens get elected to is deacon of the church
you dont have to do this minny

minny storms out the back door
skeeter looks like she might get sick
and that was a good mood
minny immediately storms back in the kitchen
im gone do it
i just want to make sure you know this aint no game were playing here
skeeter nods trembling as minny slides a chair in the middle of the kitchen and sits
slide your chair out from under that table and face me
i want to see you square on at all times
still trembling skeeter slides her chair from the table and just sits there staring at minny
is got to come up with your questions too
with where you were born
aibileen grabs her notebook and begins writing
belzoni mississippi on my great aunties sofa
minny talks a mile a minute
aibileen continues writing
once minny got to talking bout food she liked to never stop
i put the green beans in first then i go on and get the pork chops going cause mmm mmm i like my chops hot out the pan
just as aibileen fills the first notebook skeeter hands her another from her satchel
but when she got to talking about the white ladies it took all night
the first signs of morning sun filter into the kitchen
oh minny im gone give you a week paid vacation
now i aint had no paid vacation in my life
a week later i come back and theyd moved to mobile
miss lazy fingers scared id find a new job before she moved
minny spins around to aibileen with sudden realization
we gots to get more maids
skeeters eyes widen with hope
i know but it hard minny
mind racing minny flies out the door without a word
aibileen turns to skeeter
you gone and done it now
miss stein discusses aibileen and minnys stories with skeeter on the phone
i like this sarah ross
she can kvetch but not complain too much
skeeter nods rapidly as if she knows what kvetch means
and this bertha
shes got chutzpah
ill give her that
you liked it
eugenia martin luther king just invited the country to march with him in d
this many negroes and whites havent worked together since gone with the wind

i need it by new years and dont send me anything more until you have twelve maids
minny aibileen and skeeter sit at the kitchen table

skeeter jumps up from her chair

aibileen and minny lean back
i would never do that
it wouldnt be real
dont give up on us miss skeeter
skeeter softens and sits back down
thank you both for trying
skeeter delivers the miss myrna columns to the receptionist who hands her back a paycheck
celia and minny stand at a fried chicken assembly line
what can you cook
minny dips pieces chicken in an egg wash then drops them in a paper bag
a puff of flour rises out of the bag
i can cook corn pone boil potatoes and do grits
minny bursts out laughing
we didnt have electric current where i was raised
well i reckon if theres anything you ought to know bout cooking
minny holds up a can of crisco
the most important invention since they put mayonnaise in a jar
you dont even know the things you can do with this here can
celia peers into the skillet as minny spoons out a mound of crisco
looks like frosting
minny rolls her eyes and hands celia the bag of chicken
celia starts shaking the bag
this is fun
minny sits down at the table with a plate of chicken
celia sits down next to her
looks so good
aggravated minny stands
you supposed to eat in the dining room miss celia
that how it works
minny grabs celias plate
here ill take your plate in the dinin room for ya

minny sits back down with a sigh
celia touches her arm
im real grateful youre here
miss celia you got a lot more to be grateful for than me
a car is heard pulling up in the driveway
minny slides down underneath the kitchen table
its just the florist
johnny must have sent me flowers
minny pulls herself up off the floor
miss celia i aint playin around no more
he gone catch me here and shoot me dead right here on this no wax floor
you gots to tell him

maybe we ought to burn the chicken a little
the doorbell rings
celia runs off to answer
minny dont burn chicken
skeeter sits with a towel draped across her shoulders
charlotte now in an auburn wig squirts mounds of goo from a pink tube onto skeeters hair
this is bound to work sweetie
it even smells expensive
she begins twisting skeeters hair into gooey spikes
i feel the hope in your fingers
skeeter resembles a papier mache starfish
how can you not know his last name
hes williams cousin
thats all i know
thats just so sweet of hilly
charlotte takes a drag from her cigarette then lifts up a silver machine complete with power cord and rubber hose
what is that
it cost eleven dollars
im a good mother
charlotte puts a shower cap device on skeeters head and reads from the shinolator manual
the miracle straitening cap must remain on the head for two hours
charlotte flips a switch and takes another drag
the machine groans to life
skeeters cap inflates
ill have pascagoula bring you a magazine
skeeter snatches her mothers cigarette and takes a drag
skeeter sits under the shinolator buried in a magazine
pascagoula enters and sets down a glass of tea
do you think this dress is cute
skeeter holds the magazine up to pascagoula
only now does she realize what shes said and done
pascagoula nods and starts to walk away then turns
i knew constantine
she was a mighty fine woman
the shinolator was a success
skeeters hair is straight silky and beautiful
youve shrunk five inches
youll be able to wear heels tonight
charlotte looks down to the huarache shoes on skeeters feet and rushes to the closet
youre not leaving this house in those awful mexican man shoes
charlotte pulls out a dress and pair of heels
what time is he picking you up
hes meeting me at hillys
can i take the cadillac
we promised carlton the cadillac tonight
so williams cousin will just have to come get you himself
ill take the truck
its hooked to the motor grader
ill drive slow
skeeter pulls away in a rusted chevy farm truck with a huge motor grader attached
charlotte runs next to the truck
her wig is askew
remember to smile
skeeter floors it
charlotte runs faster
and dont sit like some squaw indian
skeeter leaves her mother in a cloud of dust
i love you
chunks of mud fly off the tires
the june sun has set the trucks interior at a stubborn degrees
skeeter has no choice but to lower her window
the shinolator meets its match
a mangy stray cat suddenly jumps out in the road
when towing pounds of farm equipment slowing down quickly isnt an option
a loud thud sounds out from the trucks grill
hilly her husband william and skeeters date stuart whitworth drink high balls and eat cheese in the holbrook parlor
gold swag curtains hang on the windows
balding and pudgy only williams family money once made him a desirable bachelor
stuart on the other hand is very handsome the marlboro man in a well tailored suit
yule may who we met earlier at church with aibileen now works for hilly
she clears empty glasses
with your daddys endorsement i can win that senate seat
stuart feigns interest
ill talk to him
ice slams against stuarts teeth as he downs his drink
hilly pats williams leg then turns with concern to a grandfather clock announcing half past the hour
the front door flies open
skeeter enters completely out of breath and sweaty
her hair has tripled in size
as hilly races toward skeeter william and stuart stand
stuart is as tall as he is handsome
boys well be right back
yall talk about quarterbacks or something
yule may get miss skeeter a coca cola
yule may runs off
hilly pulls skeeter down the hall
skeeter sits on the toilet downing a coca cola
hilly twists the last of skeeters hair into giant rollers
skeeter you dont even have on lipstick
skeeter dabs her armpits
it was so goddamn awful
i hit a cat
hilly sprays final net
what do you think of him
skeeter applies lipstick
hilly removes the rollers
he looks handsome
skeeter stands up and does a twirl for hilly
all right give it to me
one to ten
hilly sprays skeeter with perfume and stands back
hilly nods lets out a little squeal
honey youre beautiful
just go on out there
youre gonna do great
its your time skeeter
i just know it
hilly hugs skeeter
hilly william stuart and skeeter sit at a round table adorned with white linens silver and fine china
the room buzzes with jacksons elite all trying to be noticed as a jazz quartet plays softly in a corner
a waiter approaches
stuart leans into skeeter without making eye contact
you want a drink
just water please
double old kentucky straight
with a water back
make that two backs
you went to alabama
hilly rolls her eyes
we still love him
hilly pinches stuart on the cheek
now youre in the oil business
hilly says youre a rigsite leader
the moneys good
if thats what you really want to know
thats not what i skeeter and hilly watch as stuarts and williams eyes fix on the front of the restaurant
celia and johnny have entered
celia wears a tight green dress and the reddest lipstick ever put in a tube
isnt that your old boyfriend hilly
whos his girl
lord shes hotter than delta asphalt
celia spots hilly and gives a self conscious wave
the lieutenant governor just walked in
hilly jumps up and pulls william away
the waiter returns with stuarts drink and the water backs
so what do you do with your time
i write a
a domestic maintenance column for the jackson journal
stuart smirks taking a huge sip of his drink
you mean housekeeping
skeeter nods and grabs her water
jesus i cant think of anything worse than reading a cleaning column
except maybe writing one
hilly and william finish shaking hands with the lieutenant governor
as he walks away hilly shouts out
wed love your support on election day
celia and johnny walk up
hilly you look lovely tonight
thank you johnny
william have you ever met celia
william steps forward and shakes celias hand
nice to meet you
hilly grabs the crook of williams arm
sweetie we need to go order our dinners
celia musters up all the courage inside her
hilly did you ever get the messages that ive been calling you
i did not
well i would love to help with the benefit
i have a lovely hand if you need invitations addressed
save the dates were mailed weeks ago
you didnt get one
celia shakes her head
mails a lot slower way out there in the country huh
now come on before they run out of trout almondine
hilly pulls william away
johnny grabs celias hand
sounds like a ploy to find a husband
becoming an expert on keeping house
well you must be a genius
you figured out my whole scheme
skeeter fumes as hilly and william return and sit
whatd we miss
isnt that what you women from ole miss major in
professional husband hunting
im sorry but were you dropped on your head as an infant
stuart blinks and then smiles somewhat impressed
desperate to change the subject hilly claps her hands
a kiss from god couldnt turn this frog into a prince
tables begin to stare
or you a princess sweetheart
as skeeter walks away she purposefully slides her purse into a glass of water knocking it over into stuarts lap
hilly and william each have a section of newspaper in their face as yule may clears breakfast dishes
yule may lingers nervously
run on now yule may
got a big crowd coming for miss leefolts baby shower
miss hilly i would like to ask you and mister william something
hilly lowers her paper and nods
yule may begins wrenching her hands
my twin boys finished high school both on the honor roll
my husband and i have been saving for years to send them to college
only now does william lower his paper
we are short seventy five dollars on one of the tuitions
william stands up kisses hilly on the cheek
well im late

which son gets to go
if we dont find all the money
hilly draws in a deep breath as does yule may
would you consider givin us a loan
ill work for free until its paid off
thats not working for free yule may
thats paying off a debt
as a christian im going to do you a favor
yule mays eyes widen as a hopeful smile forms
god doesnt give charity to those who are well and able
you need to come up with this money on your own
youll thank me one day
hilly raises the paper up to her face as yule may exits
minny and aibileen in uniform push carts side by side in the grocery store
the white shoppers are dressed casually
other maids in the store all required to be in uniform while shopping keep quietly to themselves
white women smile and chat with one another as they meander down the aisles as if the black maids arent even there
minny suddenly spots celia in the produce section
she pulls aibileen close as they peer around the corner
aibileens mouth drops open at the sight of celias shorts and tight sweater
celia is having trouble selecting produce
lord shes trying to shop
celia walks up to a maid grabs her and pulls her to the tomatoes
the maid clearly uncomfortable selects a tomato hands it to celia and scurries away
miss celia just dont see em
not between us miss hilly nobody
aibileen just nods
what you so quiet for
i know you got a opinion bout all this
you gone accuse me a philosophizing
i aint afraid a no philosophy
i dont believe in lines anymore
lines is in our heads cause people like miss hilly try to make us believe they there
celia squeezes a canteloupe with another scared maid
oh they there
i get punished for crossing them
aibileen and minny continue their conversation while waiting with several other maids at a bus stop in front of the store
lotta of folk think if you talk back to your husband you crossed a line
need to be punished
you know i aint studying no line like that
cause it aint there
cept in leroys head
lines between black and white aint there either
minny and aibileen watch as celia exits the store with her groceries and prances toward her car
so i aint crossing no line if i tell miss celia she aint good enough for miss hilly
tell her she aint in miss hillys league
all im saying is kindness dont have no boundaries
just then myrlie evers medgar evers wife approaches the bus stop with her three children
sons and and a aibileen and minny nod as the evers walk past and sit on a bench
law the evers children have gotten so big
cause they happy
myrlie got her a good man
and you better not try to say they aint no line between her medgar and my leroy
you got me
a bus pulls up and the doors open
minny aibileen and the other maids step aside to let the evers family board first
aibileen has come along to aid yule may with elizabeths baby shower
a table is set in the middle of the yard covered in white linens and hillys best sliver
hillys son sits on her lap
the other girls children wear bathing suits jumping noisily in and out of two plastic kiddy pools
yule may clears cake plates while aibileen removes crumbs with a sterling crumb scraper
mae mobley wanders up to the table
her belly almost looks distended crammed inside last years one piece
mae mo hungry momma
elizabeth turns to mae mobley but never gets up
shes always hungry
all the women laugh except for skeeter
you know she can hear you elizabeth
elizabeth looks down to her plate
aibileen sets down the scraper and kneels down to mae mobley
im on cut you some cake baby
aibileen we gave that scraper to hilly and william for their wedding present
it so pretty
hilly begins bouncing william jr
on her knee
aibileen are you enjoying your new bathroom over at elizabeths
hilly nods with a tight smile and glances to the ground at skeeters red satchel
nice to have your own isnt it
separate but equal
thats what ross barnett says and you cant argue with the governor
not in mississippi
birthplace of modern day government
hilly narrows her eyes at skeeter and turns to aibileen
aibileen did you know that me and mister holbrook arranged for that bathroom
sent the boys over and the equipment too
hilly stays on aibileen waiting for her to say something
skeeter fumes hoping aibileen doesnt say it
and i thank you
hilly smiles and nods
hilly shoots skeeter a last look
leans into hilly and hugs her
one thing i got to say about miss hilly she love her children
always tellin them they smart and beautiful
cant go more than ten minutes without givin one a kiss
hilly kisses her son gently
and law do they love her back
when she starts up on me i just try and think a my sweet treelore and how much he loved me
that kind a love makes me cry
even when it going to miss hilly
hilly again glances to the red satchel staring quizzically at the worn booklet of the jim crow laws sticking out
yule may washes dishes as the women are heard saying their good byes on the street
skeeter slips into the kitchen
may i get you something
yule may i wanted to talk to you
yule may turns off the sink faucet making sure hilly is still cackling out on the street
i know what you want to ask miss skeeter
aibileen and minny already did
yule may closes the kitchen door
im trying to get my boys off to college
its worthwhile what yall doing but my boys are worth more
what do you understand skeeter
skeeter and yule may turn to find hilly standing in the swinging door leading into the dining room
yule may was just telling me how excited she was that her boys were going to go to college
is that true yule may
skeeter notices that hilly is holding the booklet of jim crow laws in her hand
did you also ask miss skeeter if you could borrow money
of course not hilly
hilly approaches skeeter
skeeter im starting to think youre intentionally not putting my initiative in the newsletter
eyes down yule may hurries out of the kitchen
not at all
im just so busy right now with mom
im sorry about your mother
and i know you must be so worried
hilly holds up the jim crow booklet
but im worried about you
all this carrying on lately and now youre reading this stuff
my dad had me get that for him
i mean around your friends is one thing
but believe it or not there are real racists in this town
if the wrong person caught you with this
youd be in serious trouble
skeeter snatches the booklet from hilly
and thanks for going through my things
skeeter types feverishly while smoking a cigarette
keys type out home help sanitation initiative
skeeter picks up hillys document and shakes her head
she types dont risk your childrens and familys health
yule may vacuums
she pulls the sofa away from the wall to clean beneath it
noticing something on the floor yule may leans over
she rises holding a small ruby ring
years of dust and hair blanket the pitiful gem set in ten karat gold
the vacuum seems to roar louder now
yule may breathes heavily
she shoves the ring into her uniform pocket
as skeeter bangs away on her typewriter charlotte bursts into the room stuck somewhere between panic and joy
dont panic but theres a very tall man named stuart here for you
hes a drunken asshole mother
you wouldnt like him
charlotte pulls a sun dress out of skeeters closet
skeeter love and hate are two horns on the same goat
and you need a goat
skeeter charlotte and stuart sit in the living room
pascagoula serves finger sandwiches
stuart looks nice in khaki pants a blue blazer and a red tie
his nose is pink from working in the sun
no one says a word
stuart would you like a cocktail
skeeter shoots her mother a what the
little too early
charlotte moves on
whats your last name stuart
where are you from
well i know a whitworth from natchez
but hes a senator up in washington
thats my daddy
thats my father
charlottes jaw drops to her string of pearls
charlotte stands flustered yet joyful
tell him i said hello
im going to go see if pascagoula needs some help in the kitchen
charlotte backs away behind stuarts chair
she points at skeeter violently as if to say dont mess this up
skeeter and stuart stand beneath an old cypress tree as charlotte peeps from an upstairs window
i know it was a few weeks back but i came here to say im sorry for the way i acted
who sent you
william or hilly
i was rude and ive been thinking about it a lot
well i havent
so just go
i told hilly i wasnt ready to go out on any date
i wasnt even close to ready
stuart shoves his hands in his pockets like a boy
i was engaged last year
she ended it
skeeter refuses to pity him
wed been dating since we were fifteen
you know how it is
actually i dont
ive never dated anyone before
stuart looks up and starts laughing loudly
that must be it then
ive never met a woman that said exactly what she was thinking
ive got plenty to say
would you like to
come downtown with me and have dinner
we could talk
we could listen to each other this time
i cant think of anything worse
stuart looks down and nods
then im sorry
thats what i came to say and
i said it
stuart turns and walks towards his car self consciously weaving his strong fingers through his hair
skeeter looks up to her mothers empty window and shouts out to stuart
just give me a minute
let me get my sweater
skeeter and stuart sit closely as the same waiter as before approaches
what do you want skeeter
ill have a co cola
lots of ice
no i mean in life
what do you want
only now does skeeter notice the tray of champagne the waiter is holding
stuart nods as two glasses are set before them
the waiter leaves
i want to be a journalist
maybe a novelist
i like that
ive been thinking about you
youre smart youre pretty youre
and i read your column
i never knew crisco got rid of diaper rash
skeeter laughs and slaps him playfully
i hope you get to write something really good skeeter
something you believe in
stuart suddenly leans over and kisses skeeter
stuart and skeeter make out hard in the back of the holbrooks convertible
hilly and william sit in the front
hilly peers into the rearview mirror to get a better view
proud of herself she pats williams leg
william slides his hand up hillys leg
she jerks it away
aibileen sits on the kitchen floor next to a bucket
she feverishly scours grease off the baseboards
elizabeths car pulls up
baby girl home
the car door slams shut
my trunks full
aibileen rises slowly placing a hand on her knee
outside elizabeth suddenly shouts out hysterically
she gets up looks out the window
mae mobley sits on aibileens toilet in the garage
door wide open pants around her ankles
me and aibiee bafroom momma
elizabeth runs over and yanks mae mobley off popping her hard on the behind
mae mobley begins to cry
aibileen watches as elizabeth hiss whispers and yanks mae mobley hard on the arm
this is dirty out here
youll catch diseases
elizabeth punctuates with three more slaps to her legs
aibileen sits on the couch with mae mobley who eats a cookie
mae mobleys face is red and damp
im here baby girl
aibileen kisses her on the cheek
you is kind
you is smart
you is important
you want me to tell you one a our secret stories
mae mobley nods
the phone rings
i got it
aibileen sits back down and leans into mae mobley
one day this wise martian come down to earth to teach us people a thing or two
oh he about six two
whats his name
martian luther king
what did he look like
looked just like us nose mouth hair on his head
but sometimes people looked at him funny and were just downright mean to him
why was they so mean
cause he was green
elizabeth suddenly barges into the living room
we have to go help hilly
elizabeth runs outside
aibileen grabs mae mobley
elizabeth wobbles briskly up the street holding her pregnant belly
aibileen and mae mobley follow
a stream of people walk toward them laughing
they round a corner to see fifty old toilets in every shape and color imaginable littering hillys lawn
some have towering tanks with chain pulls at the top providing amusement to the procession of cars driving by
the holbrooks station wagon sits in the driveway doors still open with luggage tied to the roof
two old black men struggle to remove a toilet under williams supervision
aibileen hides her smile
mae mobley points
hilly flies out of her house as a reporter snaps a picture of her
get out of here
hilly pushes him in the bushes and runs up to elizabeth
she put it in the newsletter
i specifically said old coats are to be dropped at my house
hilly faces the toilets again and screams
she put it in the newsletter when she knew wed be down at the beach
hilly steps up to aibileen and points to the old men
go help those boys get those aibileen rides in the back of a bus with a young black man
two white men sit right behind the white driver
the bus slows to a stop in the middle of the road
in the distance blue lights flash in front of a road block
a few people gather
yall stay put
let me find out whats going on
as the driver gets up a wlbt tv news truck whizzes by followed by a police motorcycle
aibileen leans in the aisle and looks ahead
the driver returns
the young black man speaks up
what happen up there mister
colored people off
white people lemme know where yall are going
ill get you as close as i can
as the young black man helps aibileen down the aisle a white passenger taps the driver on the shoulder
whats going on
aibileen and the young man walk down the stairs
i dont know
some nigger got shot
where you headed
the bus door shuts and the driver backs away
aibileen and the young man walk along a dark street
the sound of cicadas and sirens fill the air
you all right
you close to home
i be all right
my house is seven blocks from here
want me to walk you
naw thank ya
ill be fine
law i hope this aint as bad as aibileen turns to discover the young man is gone
she stares into the darkness
scared she begins to run
she cuts through a yard and trips over a hedge
she falls hard to her knees
terrified aibileen begins to sob
she sees minnys porch light and pulls herself up
minny sits with all five of her children sugar leroy jr kindra felicia and benny
they all listen anxiously to a radio on the table
aibileen opens the screen door and falls to the floor
minny jumps up to help her
she sees blood and grass stains streaking the knees of aibileens panty hose
aibileen nods trying to compose herself
almost ten years serving as the field secretary for the naacp
medgar evers is dead
aibileen swallows hard
kkk shot him
right in front a his children aibileen
we gone pray for the evers
we gone pray for myrlie
minny raises her fists
we living in hell
our kids is trapped
minny turns to sugar

sugar leads the kids to the back of the house
what they gone do to us if they catch us with miss skeeter
we gone be careful
hitch us to a pickup and drag us behind
shoot me front a my kids
we aint doing civil rights with miss skeeter
we just tellin stories like they really happen
minny and aibileen grab hands and squeeze hard
you a fool old woman
aibileen hugs minny
i cant believe im on say this
but i actually wish leroy was home right now
aibileen and minny laugh a little through the tears
elaine stein sits at her desk flipping through the new york times
she notices something actually laughs
a picture shows hilly standing among the fifty toilets in her front yard
a caption reads come on by have a seat
home of william and hilly holbrook jackson mississippi
stuart on the deck of an offshore oil rig laughs as he looks at hillys picture inside a local newspaper
he writes on the back of a postcard addressed to skeeter i guess you potty trained hilly
much love stuart
skeeter parks and gets out of her car
she suddenly finds herself face to face with hilly
you are sick
do not speak to me
do not look at me
dont say hello to my children
how long had you been planning to humiliate my family
thats not it hilly
you thought you were so clever didnt ya
but ive already installed three of those old toilets in peoples garages
technically it was a typo hilly
i intend to tell stuart hes ruining his reputation by associating with you
jolenes yard boy saw you hanging around the colored bus stop
i wasnt hanging
i guess your car was in the shop
skeeter looks away
you know as well as i do people wont buy so much as a slice of pound cake from an organization that harbors racial integrationists
skeeter steps forward
hilly just who is that pound cake money being raised for anyway
hilly rolls her eyes
the starving children of africa
skeeter nods and walks away
hilly shouts out
just so you know lou ann templeton has taken your seat at bridge club
minny walks in notices its eerily quiet
minny walks into celias bedroom
miss celia you in here
minny hears running water and muffled crying behind the bathroom door
she presses her ear to the door
minny twists the knob
go on home for the day
you mess up your hair coloring again
i helped you fix it last time got it back real pretty
celia yells at minny for the very first time
i said go home minny
minny sees water creeping out from under the door
she steps back and charges shoulder first
the bathroom door bursts open with splinters of wood
minny slips in a pool of watered down blood
celia sits against the wall in a bloody nightgown
celia aimlessly moves the blood around with a wash cloth
theres so much blood
why is there so much blood this time
minny crawls over peers into the toilet bowl and gags
will you get it out
i cant look at it again
shaken minny reaches for a trash can
she puts her hand on celias neck and pushes it down
keep your head down
celia lies in bed while minny presses a cool rag to her forehead
celia stares out of her bedroom window
the two rosebushes stand in the middle of the front lawn
a doctor enters the room
give her another pill if she gets too agitated
therell be more bleeding but dont call me unless its heavy
minny nods as the doctor leaves
we got married because i was pregnant
but it slipped out too
thats just gods way
next ones gonna catch
johnny wants kids now
i thought if i was real still brought somebody in to do the house and cooking maybe id hold on to this one
oh minny whats he gonna do with me
he gone have to get over this
he needs to know this takes time
he doesnt know about this one or the one before
minny turns to celia stunned by this revelation
minny you know how to play bridge dont you
i used to help missus walters practice
aibileen holds a plate of grits covered in toasted marshmallows strawberries and three lighted candles
mae mobley two today
mae mobley laughs as aibileen sets down the grits
mae mobley three

mae mobley blows out the candles

mae mobley picks up a candle and licks off the grits

those other ones are just pretend
celia digs a hole next to the two existing rosebushes
a closed shoebox and new rosebush wait to be planted
celia lowers the box in the grave covering it with dirt
celia and minny sit at a card table holding playing cards
two additional hands lay face up on the table in front of two empty chairs across from them
minny lays down one of her cards then looks over to celias hand
she removes a card from celias and lays it down
she then points to the hand next to celia
hilly stands at her podium tan and ready to lead
she holds her gavel like a weapon
first order of business
were updating our newsletter
hilly stares right at skeeter who sits alone in the back
were adding a fashion column with all the latest trends
your dresses better be cute at next weeks benefit
the women applaud and tap each other on their thighs
now its time to choose a new editor for our new modern monthly
skeeter braces herself as hands pop up everywhere
jolene french stands
i nominate hilly holbrook
jolene looks back and snarls at skeeter
jolene youre the sweetest thing
all in favor of hilly say aye
the room erupts
skeeters ousting took less than ten seconds
elizabeth secretly turns to skeeter from a few rows ahead
im so sorry
skeeter sits alone on the porch swing in her nightgown shifting through the miss myrna letters
charlotte steps onto the porch
honey would you like me to drop you off at bridge club on the way to my doctors appointment
its been cancelled
mae mobleys sick or something
bridge is underway at the leefolt house
aibileen enters holding a tray of coffee cups
elizabeth hilly jolene and several other girls giggle as they kneel down behind furniture
elizabeth looks back
her belly is huge
theres a knock at door
elizabeth its me celia foote
i was in the neighborhood and thought id drop by
the girls giggle more loudly now
celia peers into the living room window
the bridge tables are in plain view
celias face grows pinker than her sweater
brought you a chocolate pie
my maid minny made it
hillys face hardens
minny stands at the sink shelling peas
a distinct red cut is perched above her swollen eye
celia sits at the kitchen table halfway through the pie
they made me stand there like the vacuum man
minny freezes keeping her face on the peas
because they know about you getting knocked up by mister johnny
they mad you married one a they mens
especially since mister johnny and miss hilly had just broke up too
so hilly probably thinks i was fooling around with johnny while they were still going steady
missus walters says miss hilly still sweet on mister johnny too
celia suddenly slaps her thigh with excitement
they dont hate me
they hate what they think i did
they hate you cause they think youre white trash
and dont be takin pies to those women
well im just going to have to let hilly know im not a boyfriend stealer
in fact ill tell her friday night at the benefit
celia rises and smiles like she just cured cancer
now miss celia
please dont be going to that benefit
celia gets some ice out of the fridge
did you hear what i said
celia places the ice in a towel and approaches minny
she looks at the cut above her eye
what are you doing
that looks bad
i got to get my work done
i know you didnt fall in the tub minny
let me take a look
celia grabs minnys hand
minny pulls away
just then johnny pulls up in the driveway
celia and minny turn to the window then spring into action
minny sits crouched on the lid of the guest bath toilet as johnny chases celia around the house
come here sexy
johnny you are bad
minny looks at the ridiculous image of herself crouching on the toilet in the bathroom mirror
she raises celias ice rag up to her swollen eye
skeeter enters quietly through aibileens kitchen door
she is surprised to see twenty other black women standing solemnly around the kitchen and the living room
aibileen approaches with a worried look
yule may in prison miss skeeter
gone be there four years
minny shouts out across the kitchen
hilly holbrook been sent from the devil to ruirn all our lives
hilly and the usual suspects play bridge at hillys house
aibileen pours coffee an earshot away
a nigra walks in a pawn shop with a ring of such size and clarity
it tookem all of five minutes to figure out where she worked
hilly leads the girls nods of acknowledgement
i knew that girl was a thief the day she started
as minny wipes her nose with her sleeve skeeter approaches
ill ask daddy to get her a good lawyer
she had a lawyer
a white lawyer
but miss hilly friends with the judges wife
whole thing took two days
arrested on tuesday in the state pen by wednesday
the church gone send them boys to college
gone pass the plate til they graduate
the women part making way as aibileen leads skeeter to a seat at the kitchen table
pearly sits next to skeeter and touches her arm
im on help with your stories
another woman walks over
im on help too
another woman speaks from the living room
we all are
women of all ages slowly rise up and nod their heads
skeeter looks around in awe
i dont know what to they doing this for yule may
skeeter sits and writes as pearly begins the interviews
been there thirty eight years and miss margaret still makes me put my hair up in a rag
say she know coloreds dont wash theys hair
but i love her
she love me too
i had been workin for miss jolenes mother up til she died
then her daughter miss nancy asked me to come work for her
miss nancy a real sweet lady
but her momma left it in the will that i had to work for her daughter miss jolene
miss jolene a mean woman
mean for sport
i tried to get another job but in everbody mind the french family and miss jolene owned me
callie takes off her glasses and wipes her eyes
i used to take a shortcut ever day to work at doctor dixons house
cut through this farmers lower forty to get there
one day that farmer was waitin on me with a gun said hed shoot me dead if i walk on his land again
doctor dixon went and paid that farmer double for two a those acres
told him he bout to start farmin too
but he bought it just for me
so i could get to work easy
skeeter closes her eyes for moment
when she opens them she sees a vision of constantine standing constantine smiles and grabs skeeters hand
she presses her thumb firmly in her palm
when skeeter blinks again the vision is gone
standing in place of constantine is gretchen
all these colored women have been real nice havent they
well they hate you
you know this
every little thing about you
but youre so dumb you think youre doing them a favor
skeeter and the other maids are taken aback
you dont have to do this
you know the nicest thing a white womans ever done for me
gave me the heel of her bread
these women are playing a trick on you
theyll never tell you the truth
you dont know what theyve said
say it lady say the word you think every time one us stands in front of you
aibileen crosses over to gretchen
thats enough gretchen
you just as dumb as she is
get out a my house
aibileen sits with skeeter on the sofa reading and answering miss myrna letters
aibileen is dressed very nicely
several flower arrangements are placed around the room
an unwrapped present rests on the coffee table
tell her to pour vinegar in her trash cans
then them dogs will stay away
as skeeter writes this down someone walks onto aibileens front porch
skeeter becomes worried
aibileen looks to a wall clock and smiles
about a dozen letters and cards fall into a basket under the mail slot
aibileen jumps up and starts sorting through the cards
today my birthday miss skeeter
well happy birthday aibileen
you should have told me
and from all over the county my babies find they way home
aibileen stops on one card in particular
she sits back down next to skeeter
some even from overseas
alton spears lives in paris now
married him a real pretty french girl
got five kids too
theys my grandbabies
aibileen opens the card to find a twenty dollar bill inside along with a picture of the spears family
aibileen reads the card aloud
i still dont drink coffee
aibileen laughs and raises her hand to her mouth
skeeter is touched
the doorbell rings
aibileen jumps up and opens the door
a delivery man greets her with two more vases of flowers
aibileen looks out to the street where a white woman gets out of her car with a huge country ham
two little girls in matching dresses jump out behind her
the woman sees aibileen on the porch and waves
aibileen waves back and smiles
catching it all the moment soon grows bittersweet for skeeter
she wipes her eye
morning light shines into skeeters room
stuart has returned from the rig
fully clothed he and skeeter sleep on skeeters bed
charlotte shouts skeeters name from down the hall
skeeters eyes pop open
shes groggy and hasnt fully realized the company lying next to her
stuart throws his arm over skeeter
reality sinks in
skeeter rolls over to find stuart eyes shut smiling
oh my god
oh my god
when stuart tries to get up skeeter flattens him reaches down and pulls the covers up over his entire body
dont move a muscle
skeeter props up on her side and faces the door making sure the covers hide that shes clothed
charlotte enters and heads straight for skeeters closet
morning sleepy head
charlotte pulls out a dress and lays it on the bed right on top of stuart
i thought you could take me to the doctor this morning and then we could get some lunch afterwards
charlotte spies a large toe sticking out of the covers
it belongs to stuart but she assumes its skeeters
looking at toe or
go straight to fanny maes for a girl day
ill get dressed
when did stuart leave last night
right after you went to bed
well i hope he knows hes welcome to stay in carltons old room
im not really ready for that yet
bird in the hand eugenia
charlotte exits and shuts the door
under the covers
skeeter is mortified
stuart sits up grinning
oh my god
stuart tries to kiss skeeter
my breath is horrible
so is mine
stuart embraces skeeter and brings his lips close to hers
i love you
i love you too
a banks clock shows twelve noon in downtown jackson
its eerily quiet not a soul on the street
we hear archival footage of walter cronkite addressing the nation
minny stands at the top of a tall step ladder vacuuming oscars head
celia runs into the living room
tears stream down her face
minny turns to celia
cronkite tells the nation that john f
kennedy is dead
minnys eyes roll back in her head as she starts to faint
she grabs on to oscars body and slides down to the floor
hilly sits with her son william playing on a blanket on the front lawn
a neighbor suddenly pulls up in his car stopping in front of hilly
he leans out and tells hilly the tragic news
in complete disbelief hilly puts her hand over her mouth
she then grabs william pulls him in close as if hes somehow in danger
aibileen huddles with a dozen other maids in a circle
theyre all crying
some throw their hands in the air
skeeter and stuart sit solemnly with the phelan family watching cronkites coverage of the kennedy funeral
skeeters dad wipes tears from his eyes
stuart checks the time and leans into skeeters ear
honey im sorry but i have to get down to the coast
skeeter nods as stuart kisses her
ill be back in time for the benefit
we hear walter cronkites parting thoughts on jfk
minny skeeter and aibileen sit quietly compiling stories
aibileen and minny look up to aibileens framed picture of john f
aibileen grows anxious
she suddenly jumps out of her chair and paces around the kitchen
are you okay
the world done gone crazy miss skeeter
and im scared
what if folks find out what we writing
figure out niceville really jackson and figure out who who
weve changed all the names
yall two gone sit there and tell me you one hundred percent without a doubt sure bout all this
skeeter looks away
so i been thinking
maybe we need us some insurance
skeeter look to minny
i told god id never speak of it again
but we got no choice
time to tell you both the terrible awful i did to miss hilly
it might be the only thing to protect us
we continue with the earlier flashback where minny arrives at hillys with her famed chocolate pie
hilly leads minny into the kitchen missus walters follows behind
hilly slices a big piece and grabs a fork
she leans against the counter and takes a big bite
nobody wanted to hire a sass mouthing thieving nigra did they
minny stands silent as hilly finishes in three bites
pies as good as always minny
im glad you like it
hilly cuts another piece for herself
i take you back ill have to cut your pay five dollars a week
not expecting this minny leans away from hilly
take me back
hilly takes an even bigger bite from the second slice
what do you put in here that makes it taste so good
that good vanilla from mexico
minnys eyes narrow over a forced smile
something else real special
missus walters grabs a plate and reaches for the pie
no missus walters
that miss hillys special pie
momma can have a piece
hilly slides the pie a little too fast down the counter toward minny
minny stops it before it falls to the floor
cut her one
eat my shit
hilly calmly sets her plate down on the counter
what did you say
i said eat my shit
have you lost your mind
minny moves toward hilly
but youre about to cause you just did
minny nods smugly as she looks down at hillys slice
missus walters immediately gets it
she bursts out laughing so hard she has to lower herself to the floor
well hilly thats what you get i guess
and you didnt just eat one
you ate two slices
hilly starts to hyperventilate as everything sinks in
as minny leaves hilly runs to the sink and throws up
aibileen and skeeter are speechless
you trying to get yourself killed
i never planned to tell her
i just wanted to see her take a bite and leave so i could be done with her
she was never supposed to ask me back
minny eyes narrow
and then for less pay
that got me even madder
and then she went slid that pie at me
that was it
i just lost control aibileen
you know how i get now
so before i knew it it just came on out my mouth
and i had tolt her what was in that pie
aibileen looks to skeeter shaking her head
minny suddenly gets misty
she wipes her eyes
ive asked god to forgive me
but more for what happened to poor missus walters
miss hilly threw her in that nursing home just for laughing
we cant put that story in the book

minny gets up and walks toward aibileen

minny storms out of aibileens kitchen
miss stein talks to skeeter on the phone

and you must get a piece in about the domestic who raised you

skeeter nods with frustration
the african childrens benefit ball is well underway
the energy and look of the two hundred attendees feel like a throwback to the womens suffrage movement
many older women wear heavy long black skirts and jackets
hilly wears swathes of maroon colored taffeta
ruffles clutch her throat
she stands next to jolene french and a dressed to the nines jolene raises a microphone and looks into the camera
this is jolene french reporting from the african childrens benefit ball and im here with league president miss hilly holbrook
three dozen servers stand in a line
minny and aibileen are among them
tables are covered with items donated for the auction
on the baked goods table minnys famed chocolate pie promises to again be a big money maker
celia and johnny enter the ballroom
celia wears a hideous pink and silver sequined gown
as usual celias breasts command attention
the room locks on celia as specks of light bounce off her dress and jiggle across the ceiling
a titillated old husband tips his martini onto his wifes shoe
a little too loudly look at the jugs on that one
other wives dig fingernails into husbands arms
the mans wife responds louder
bosoms are for bedrooms and breast feeding
not occasions of dignity
celia downs a glass of champagne and leans into johnny
do you think i might have overdressed a little
its supposed to be formal but this looks like a funeral
you look gorgeous
minny pulls aibileen aside and points to celia
look what she got on
celia grabs more champagne from a passing server
lord have mercy
ladies better hold onto they husbands tonight
celia catches eyes with minny
she smiles and nods quickly and then looks away careful not to tip off johnny of their relationship
and thats the man that dont even know hes paying me
skeeter enters with stuart
she wears a long sleeved black velvet dress and her hair is being somewhat cooperative
theres skeeter and that must be stuart
missus walters enters wearing a floor length blue beaded gown circa
a white orchid wilts at her clavicle
hilly can throw her in a home but she cant keep the taxis away
celia approaches elizabeth and jolene who talk next to a punch bowl
celia is now drinking some kind of pink drink with an umbrella sticking out of it
well hello elizabeth
elizabeths homemade maternity ball gown resembles a velvet potato sack cinched with red ribbon
those are lovely dresses
i was worried i was a tad overdressed
jolene reaches out an pats celias shoulder
youre just perfect
elizabeth pulls jolene away
celia downs her drink
the guests are now seated at twenty eight round tables
scores of black servers dressed in tuxedos ferry plates
hilly makes her way to the podium
everybody enjoying their dinner
the room claps enthusiastically
lets give a nice round of applause for all the men and women that have helped make tonight possible
hilly mechanically gestures toward the servers in the room
a cause im sure is dear to their hearts as well
skeeter shakes her head as the less inspired applause dies down
celia waves to minny and jumps out of her chair
johnny grabs celia by the arm and pulls her back down
celia reaches for johnnys glass of wine
honey maybe youve had enough to drink
try to eat your dinner
and have my stomach poke out
as celia looks at the prize tables bids johnny and stuart lean against a bar chatting with a few other bored men
hilly suddenly slides next to johnny completely ignoring stuart
why johnny foote
im surprised to see you here
everybody knows you cant stand parties like this
hilly squeezes the crook of his arm
celia wouldnt have missed this for anything
where is that wife of yours
out selling hotdogs
johnny looks away
oh you know im teasing you
we dated long enough where i can do that cant i
johnny walks away leaving hilly no choice but to acknowledge stuart
she and stuart never look each others way
hilly walks away as jolene approaches the podium
ive got the list of winners
jolene finishes up the winners list
i hope you enjoy your new set of tires missus atwell
now on to the baked goods
jolene flips a page
the highest bid in baked goods goes to minny jacksons chocolate pie
congratulations hilly holbrook
the room erupts in applause
hilly now sits at a table with her family missus walters and the leefolts
skeeter and stuart sit at a table full of elderly people they dont know
minny clears dishes nearby
hearing her name she becomes very alert
i didnt bid on anything
minny turns to find hilly smiling at her tightly
well wasnt that sweet
someone signed me up for that pie
celia rushes up behind hilly her voice slurred
i didnt know youre a fan of minnys pies
hilly remains calm
celia grabs hillys long sleeve
ive wanted to talk to you all night
minny told me why you wont be my friend
you think me and johnny went behind your back
let me go
hilly stands up and pulls away
a ripping sound cuts through the air
celia stares at hillys torn cuff in her hands
im so sorry
what are you trying to do to me
what are you and that nigra up to
jolene announces another round of winners loudly over the microphone forcing celia to raise her voice
i dont know what you you liar
who did you tell
jolene loses her place on the list
the room grows quiet but celia is still yelling
hilly i got pregnant after you and johnny broke up
the room echoes with celias words
across the room womens noses wrinkle
shut up mother
stuart belts out with a laugh
skeeter pinches his arm
celia is mortified
sweat beads on her forehead
johnny never cheated on you
at least not with me
celia starts to breathe heavily
her eyes start to water
johnny would never and im sorry i thought youd be tickled to win that pie
you tell that nigra if she tells anybody i will make her suffer
horrified skeeter catches eyes with minny and aibileen
they all immediately look away
johnny makes his way over
celia holds her breath shaking her head back and forth
celia whats wrong honey
celia leans over and vomits on the fleur de lis print carpet
the entire room gasps in horror
johnny tries to pull celia back
she pushes johnny away and runs for the bathroom
hilly marches over to aibileen who is standing nearby
get that cleaned up before it starts to smell
minnys daughter sugar stands over a large commercial sink filled with sudsy water washing dishes
minny approaches from behind as sugar holds court with five other young girls
that big boobed lady momma works for was drunker than an injun on payday
upchucked in front a everbody
as the girls all laugh minny pops sugar hard on the back of her head
dont you never let me hear you talking bad about the lady who puts food in your mouth
clothes on your back
you hear me
minny storms off
you do it all the time
hilly and william walk to their car
missus walters follows closely behind holding minnys pie
just come on home and stay with us tonight mother
no thanks i got a pie to eat
hilly spins around and sees the pie
you throw that pie away right now
i spent good money on this
won it just for you
you signed me up
missus walters steps up to hilly
i may have trouble remembering my own name and what country i live in
but theres two things i cant seem to forget
that my own daughter threw me in a nursing home
and that she ate minnys shit
missus walters winks at hilly and ambles to a waiting taxi cab
celia lies in bed with the covers pulled over her face
minny enters carrying a tray of food setting it down next to two other trays of uneaten food
aint mister johnny gone wonder how dinner got on the table if you laid up in bed
celia pulls the covers off her head and sits up a little
the way hilly looked at me
like i was trash on the road
celia pulls a letter out from under the covers
she billed me for her dress
in lieu of payment shes asked that i send two hundred dollars to the african childrens fund and then she banned me from all future league events
she dont count
dont judge yourself by the way she see you
im not right for this kind of life minny
i dont need a dinner table for twelve people
i couldnt get two people over here if i begged
she called me a liar and accused me of getting her that pie
i wouldnt have thrown up if it wasnt for that
i cant do this anymore to johnny
im going back to sugar ditch
you gone leave your husband cause you threw up at some party
lord i reckon its time you knew
celia stares at minny wide eyed and disgusted
miss hilly thought you knew bout the terrible awful that you were making fun a her
its my fault she pounced on you
but if you leave mister johnny then miss hilly done won the whole ball game
then she done beat me and she done beat you
celia lies there
minnys concerned shes said too much
for telling me that
stuart lies on a bed inside the presidential suite of the roosevelt hotel
hes on the phone with skeeter
skeeter talks to stuart
pascagoula cooks breakfast
how are you calling me
arent you on the rig
what if i told you i have twenty four hours in new orleans
that im in the presidential suite of the roosevelt hotel
that we have dinner reservations in the blue room tonight and lunch tomorrow at galatoires
skeeter becomes troubled
did you hear me
i spoke to your dad and hes gonna have jameso drive you down right now
i have to work
work in the car
jesus skeeter its a cleaning column
i have a deadline sweetie
you should have asked me about this
im trying to be romantic
im sorry honey
i cant come
stuart shakes his head and hangs up the phone
aibileen and skeeter sit across from faye belle palsied and gray skinned and hunched in a wheelchair
aibileen grabs faye belles hand stirring a sudden flash of memory
her voice is coarse and hard to understand
i remember hiding with miss lilia in a steamer trunk while yankee soldiers stomped through masters house
we were both four
eighty five years later she died in my arms
wes were friends til the end
her grandson still pays my rent
buys all my groceries too
the manuscript sits before aibileen minny and skeeter
i have one more story to type but other than that we are done
law look at all them pages
two hundred and sixty six of em
now we just wait and see
hopin missus stein publish it
what story you got left to type
aibileen looks at skeeter
if your momma wont tell you i reckon i will
red eyed skeeter enters charlottes room
a bowl rests on the bedside table with a wet rag draped over the side
charlotte is wig free and terribly thin
her collarbone protrudes long and narrow but her eyes are as sharp as ever
have you been crying
you know that ages your skin dear
mother i need to talk to you about constantine
that was so long ago
well i have to speak to her
now you look
i was good to constantine
oh she talked back plenty of times and i put up with it
but skeeter she didnt give me a choice
charlotte much healthier scurries around the house adjusting flower arrangements and straightening pictures
i was hosting a d
constantine was to do the floors that morning so theyd be dry in time
charlotte finds constantine mopping the foyer very slowly
the effects of arthritis are apparent
well the floors were soaking wet when the first guest arrived
a guest unnecessarily grabs a table for balance making a point about the damp floor
charlotte sits with twelve women at the dining table as constantine pushes the casserole cart around and begins serving lunch
as the guests sip coffee each woman grimaces and turns to charlotte
then she burned the coffee
she had gotten so old skeeter
charlotte shoots constantine a look
constantine nods sorrowfully
she picks up a womans plate and begins filling it with food from the cart very slowly
constantine strains to lower the plate in front of the woman
her hands tremble
her mishaps were becoming a daily occurrence and i had had it
the plate tilts causing peas to pour into the womans lap
with that charlotte stands up and slaps the table with her hand
get a hold of yourself constantine
constantine slowly looks to charlotte
totally exhausted she grips the casserole cart with both hands to steady herself
and thats when it happened
constantine wets herself
slowly the women begin realizing whats happening
the two women closest to constantine gasp and quickly move away from her
another woman rises from the table covering her mouth with a napkin and leaves the room
just now realizing what has happened constantine looks down at her soiled dress
no one says a word
no one comes to constantines aid
constantine looks to charlotte
constantine hobbles with a cane down a gravel road still wearing her soiled dress
she turns and looks one last time at the phelan plantation
i told her she couldnt work here anymore and to go on home
charlotte wont look at her
how could you humiliate her like that
i didnt mean to
why didnt you help her
i was upset
i didnt know what else to do
so you just threw her away
that woman did you the biggest favor of your life
she taught me kindness and self respect and you just threw her away like a broken appliance
charlotte starts to cry
skeeter isnt affected
i didnt throw her away skeeter
your daddy went to her house the very next day to give her her job back
but she had already moved to chicago
left everything behind
cause she didnt have anything anymore
you broke her heart
please dont do this to me skeeter
i feel terrible
and you have to remember theyre not like us
they are different
charlotte gets defensive
and you idolized her too much
you always have
i needed somebody to look up to
skeeter turns to leave
i have to go find her
she needs me
we finally found the address of her daughter in chicago
so we sent carlton up there to go get constantine
skeeter turns back to her mother
when he got there
she was dead eugenia
im so sorry honey
charlotte tries to comfort her
skeeter rejects her mothers hand
why didnt yall tell me all this
i knew youd blame me
when it wasnt my fault
it just happened and it was so unfortunate
im sorry eugenia
when did she die
how long had she been in chicago
charlotte pulls the white basin closer hugs it to her side
skeeter stands never turning as she exits
skeeter stands on the back patio crying
she slowly walks off into the yard
constantines story finally made it in our book
but the reason she got fired did not
miss skeeter just couldnt put that kind a shame on her own mother
the front window of a bookstore displays many of the nations top selling books
a clerk sets a tiny stack of books in the far corner
they printed a few thousand copies with the worst advance miss stein had ever seen
the stack is the help in hardcover
its wrapped in pale blue
a white peace dove spreads its wing under the title
minny stands over the stove frying chicken as sugar enters with the days mail
minny snatches the mail from her and sees an envelope from harper and row
minny tears it open
her eyes go wide
we got four hundred dollars
got another four hundred when it got printed
divided thirteen ways that came to sixty one fifty three a person
minny hugs sugar and runs out the screen door with her check as the chicken sizzles
aibileen and minny hug each other as the jump up and down with checks in hand
minny got so excited she burnt up a skillet of chicken
minny knocks on the door holding bags of groceries
come on miss celia
get out a that bed and let me in
its twelve noon
i did all the shopping just like you asked
the door slowly opens
celia steps out onto the porch looking beautiful still dressed tacky
well look at you miss celia
celia leads minny into the dining room
the table set beautifully in silver and crystal is covered with delicious looking casseroles and fried chicken
whats all this
i cooked it all by myself
i wanted to do something special
i wanted to say thank you
celia and minny dine and minnys enjoying it
greens got just the right amount a hock taste to em
thats a good pot liquor miss celia
who taught you to cook like this
minny winks as she dunks a piece of corn bread in the greens
corn breads happy now
celia lays down her fork
are you happy minny
why you ask such a funny question
a course is happy
you happy too
big house big yard good husband
you know if i were you id give it right back to him
id hit him over the head with a skillet and tell him to go straight to hell
minny starts to protest but is tired of excuses
maybe i will
celia jumps up
i almost forgot the dessert
minny smiles softly as celia disappears into the kitchen
aibileen irons as elizabeth enters with shopping bags
she races to the television and turns it on
as the tube warms up we hear the conclusion of a tide commercial
wlbts lunchtime show people will talk continues
jolene french sits on the set of jacksons morning show
a male host watches as the show runner counts down
five four three two one
welcome back to people will talk
and do we have something to talk about
jolene has quite a book to review
jolene shakes her head visibly upset
hilly watches jolene on television as her new maid ernestine pours a cup of coffee with her right hand
ernestines left arm is missing
the maid pickings for hilly have gotten slim
why are you frowning jolene
hilly leans over and taps her television
you dont look cute that way
its called the help
a new book by an anonymous author
aibileen jerks her head toward the television
touching and enlightening its filled with testimonials from mississippis own housekeepers
minny watches transfixed as she and celia eat dessert in front of the television
look how cute that dress is
takes place in the fictional town of niceville
the book is dedicated to c and t
if youre out there c and t wed love to have you on the show because niceville sounds like jackson if you ask me
the host starts laughing
its not jackson
its a disgrace to the south
a disgrace to good southern women whove spent their lives taking care of their help
smoke rises from the shirt aibileen is ironing
she snaps to attention pulls the iron off the burned shirt
but did you read that ending
i know i personally treat my help like family and every one of my friends does the same
bertha if youre listening i have a new found respect for what you do
and believe me ill be passin on dessert at your table
minny walks like a zombie over to celia and gathers her dirty plate never taking her eyes off the television
do not buy this book
ladies of jackson do not support slander with your husbands hard earned poof
jolene disappears by way of a seal lily ice cream commercial
dont cut her off like that
whats that book called aibileen
i wasnt paying attention
stacks of the help rest on tables in the store
elizabeth enters pick up two copies and pulls them close to her body
she races to the register like a teen buying a playboy
back at the table of books we see in rapid succession the books quickly disappearing by the hands of jacksonians
aibileen skeeter and minny sit at the table
aibileens phone rings off the wall but she wont answer
i knew nothing about it
miss steins p
department called the station directly
ever maid callin to say they white ladys gone and bought the book
they so scared
one arm earnestine said miss leefolt brought a copy over to miss hilly in less than a hour
she better read it quick and start the this aint jackson crusade
dont count on it
in her one year at ole miss she never cracked a book
oh she gone read it
especially after that man made such a stink on the tee vee
she gone read it
elizabeth and hilly read the book aloud over the phone with each other
they stop and nod with speculation
a bus is filled with domestics en route to work
everyone is either reading the book or having it read to them
missus walters reads to a group of women in the home
charlotte lies in bed reading the book next to robert who is asleep
as she turns a page her face reveals a dawning realization
troubled she starts to wake robert but doesnt
charlotte trembles as she brings the book in close to her chest
she slides down to her pillow and stares at the ceiling
skeeter sits on the swing with stuart whos just arrived from the rig still wearing his dingy work clothes
that month felt like a year
i missed you so much
skeeter i told daddy im not going back on the rig
stuart nonchalantly pulls out a ring from his front pocket and places it in skeeters lap
a huge diamond is surrounded by twelve small sapphires
skeeters smile quickly fades as she raises the ring
i have to tell you something
how about yes
i had this with me down in new orleans you know
skeeter touches stuarts face
you have to promise not to tell anyone
did you say yes
stuart hugs skeeter
she pulls back
can i have your word
skeeter has again ruined stuarts big moment
you have my word
stuart storms off the porch dumbfounded
this is what youve been writing for the last twelve months
what happened to the cleaning column
i did both
skeeter approaches stuart
so the talk in town
i said they were dead wrong
told them you were too smart to get mixed up in anything like that
skeeter reaches to calm him
he pulls away
that joke you played on hilly with the toilets
hell thats funny
i dont understand why you did this
why you even care
things are fine around here
why stir up trouble
im not stirring up trouble stuart
troubles already here
i guess it is
skeeter grabs his arm
i had to tell you
you needed to know
stuart shakes his head and pulls away
i guess i dont really know you skeeter
and i cant marry somebody i dont know
stuart looks down at the ring
that was my grandmothers
skeeter hands the ring back
stuart shoves it in his pocket
i wont tell anyone
charlotte sits in bed next to robert who is fast asleep
she hears a door closing outside
come in here please
after a few moments skeeter enters
can i get you anything
come here eugenia
i want to tell you something
you go first
he had to ask daddy for your hand
she lifts skeeters ring hand
seeing her bare finger charlottes smile fades
skeeter prepares for the worst
just say it
what did you do
skeeter stands to walk away
young lady im talking to you
skeeter sits back down
stuartll come around
its a funny dance
points to robert took this one a year
anyway my news
after a long talk with your daddy ive made a decision
my healths been on the uptick these past few weeks
and i know the doctor says its some kind of last
charlotte starts coughing
skeeter hands her a tissue
but as i said i made a decision
i have decided not to die
charlotte slaps her palms as if throwing the cancer away
i tried calling fanny maes so i could make your hair appointments for the next twenty years but they wouldnt allow it
charlotte raises skeeters ring finger
i certainly cant leave you now
skeeter laughs and hugs her mother
robert never stirs
hilly drives in front of jitney jingle grocery store
she wears a scarf on her head and big sunglasses
one armed ernestine rides in the passenger seat
hilly slows in front of the stores big glass entrance
she hurriedly waves ernestine out of the car
the voters of hinds county had spoke
mister holbrook wasnt gone have no political career
one arm ernestine races to the storefront and removes williams campaign poster taped to the window
hilly reads the book in bed
william is fast asleep
suddenly her eyes widen her breath becomes heavy
she slowly turns a page and freezes
her face turns white
hilly balls both fists looks to the ceiling and screams louder than humanly possible
skeeter lies in bed sleeping
her eyes pop open
aibileen lies in bed sleeping
her eyes pop open
minny lies in bed sleeping
her eyes pop open
but this time hillys scream fades as knocks at the door grow louder
knocking that has actually stirred minny awake
sugar and kindra enter jumping in bed with minny
momma theres a white man at our door
are you in there
minny covers the girls with a blanket
she puts on a robe and grabs a bat from behind the door
i can hear you
open the door
minny approaches the door
minny jackson i want to talk to you
minny slowly opens the door
johnny is all smiles
finally i meet minny jackson
as johnny enters minny raises the bat and swings
johnny turns and stops the bat with his hand
what the hell are you doin
minny lets go of the bat and cowers on the floor raises her hands in front of her
please dont hurt me
my babies are in the house
johnny drops the bat and pulls minny up from the floor
calm down girl
im not here to get you
he suddenly throws his arms around her and squeezes hard
johnny and minny sit at her kitchen table
when i finally confronted celia about you she told me about the baby
all of them
you saved her life
i dont know about that
well i know the day you came to our house she started getting better
and im not just talking about the cookin either
you knew i was there

next morning i snuck back up to the house peeked in the window and there you were
given ol oscar a wipe down
minny smiles for the first time
so i aint losing my job
you have a job with us for the rest of your life if you want it
bridge is underway at the leefolt house with the usual suspects except skeeter
lou ann templeton has taken her place
aibileen nervously pours coffee
i heard that betty character might be charlene
its not jackson and that book is garbage
i bet the whole things made up by some nigra
aibileen begins pouring coffee into hillys cup
and jolene didnt your momma leave cora to you in her will
but thats not odd is it
happens all the time right
a sudden realization washes over jolene
did anybody ever figured out who c and t are
the book is not about jackson
aibileen spills a few drops of coffee on hillys plate
hilly looks up to aibileen slow and deliberate
you spilled some aibileen
aibileen takes the cloth from the coffee pitcher handle and dabs the spilled coffee
aibileen glances at hilly
a secret burns between them
get me a new plate
one you havent soiled with a dirty cloth
aibileen and minny walk into the church parking lot wearing their sunday best
minny takes note of all the cars
looks like bible study done already started
we aint late
as minny and aibileen enter the church
four hundred members stand at once
the congregation begins to clap
minny and aibileen look around trying to figure out the source of adulation
they both start clapping too
aibileen steps up to a woman in the last pew
who we clappin for
the woman laughs
honey we clappin for you
the woman raises a copy of the help
aibileen notices a copy of the book in each members hand
aibileen looks to minny realizing shes in on it
a reverend approaches hands aibileen a copy of the book
aibileen this is an important time for you and our church
we know you couldnt put your name in here so we all signed our own
the reverend then hands her a box wrapped in white paper tied with a blue ribbon
this is for the white lady
tell her we love her like family
skeeter sits between aibileen and minny on the sofa thumbing through her signed book
hundreds of signatures cover the pages
churches over two counties signed our books
all for you and me
aibileen points to the inside back cover
doctor king signed it too
he readin our book
aibileen glances proudly at the framed portrait of dr
we did something

skeeter closes the book and sets it down regretfully
skeeter pulls a letter out of her purse
i got a job offer from harper and row

but in the end what we should say is sorry
if bad things happen they aint nothing you can do about it
and if they happen at least now theys a reason behind it
a reason we can wrap our heads around and be proud of
skeeter nods with little relief
now i dont mean to rub salt in your wound but
you aint got a good life here in jackson
plus your mommas getting better minny aggressively chimes in
you aint got nothing left here but enemies in the junior league
you done burned ever bridge there is

minny leans over placing her hand on skeeters for the first time since knowing each other
and you listen to me
im on take care a aibileen and she gone take care a me
go find your life miss skeeter
skeeter stands next to the barn smoking a cigarette reading the harper and row offer for the hundredth time
tires crunch gravel down the drive
skeeter sees a car moving toward her with the headlights off
worried skeeter looks toward her home
charlotte can be seen in an upstairs window
skeeter soon recognizes the car as hillys
hilly parks lights a cigarette and gets out of her car
skeeter charges toward her
what are you doing here
hilly screams and throws her lit cigarette at skeeter
dont you get an inch closer
hillys a mess
her shirt is half tucked
her shorts strain to contain a newly developed layer of fat
a horrible fever blister burns hot on hillys upper lip
ive contacted my lawyer hibbie goodman
hes the best libel attorney in mississippi
youre in big trouble missy
and youre going to jail
you cant prove anything hilly
i one hundred percent know you wrote it cause nobody else in town is as tacky as you
those nigras of yours are in a lifetime of trouble
exactly who are you talking about
you dont know anything
i dont do i
you tell aibileen the next time she wants to write about my dear friend elizabeth
had you in her wedding
lets just say aibileen ought tove been a little bit smarter before putting in the l shaped crack in poor elizabeths dining table
and that nigra minny
do i have plans for her
dont give yourself away now
that was not me who ate that pie
hilly storms up the porch steps
i did not invite you here
skeeter yanks hillys arm hard
ive come to tell your mother what a hippie youve become
shes gonna be disgusted by you
skeeter cant help but laugh
youre telling my mother on me
hilly opens the door
skeeter grabs her

charlotte suddenly appears
skeeter lets go of hilly
its been such a long time dear
everything okay you two
hilly is shocked by charlottes frail appearance
missus phelan im
im here to hilly youre a mess

hilly self consciously licks her fever blister
i didnt have time to get fixed up before
darling no husband wants to come home and see this
charlotte peers closely at hillys cold sore
that is horrendous
missus phelan im here you know hilly
if i didnt know any better id say youve been eating too many
hillys face turns purple with embarrassment
charlotte moves in for the kill
im sure of it
now get out of my house
before we all get one of those on our lip
hilly looks back and forth between skeeter and her mother not knowing what to say
hilly runs out of the house as charlotte sashays quietly into the living room
shocked skeeter stands alone in the foyer
hilly sprays gravel across the phelan yard as she speeds away
come in here please
skeeter gulps as she heads toward the living room
charlotte pats the sofa as skeeter enters and sits
do you have plans tomorrow
anything like that
were going shopping
skeeter lets out a big sigh of relief
cause no single daughter of mine is going to new york representing the great state of mississippi without a proper cosmopolitan wardrobe
im very proud of you eugenia
how do you know about new york
a friend of constantines told me
charlotte reaches down and pulls up her copy of the help
would you do me the honor of signing my copy
charlotte hands skeeter a pen
her hand trembles as she signs the book never having guessed how good it would feel
aibileen washes dishes as the phone begins to ring
minny screams on the other end of the line
minny stands barefoot inside a phone booth her lip swollen face bleeding
her kids stand outside crying
they fired leroy last night
and when leroy ask why his boss say mister holbrook told him to do it
said his nigger wife the reason
he try to kill me with he bare hands

minny lets out a chuckle of relief and wipes her eyes

the leefolt front door opens
elizabeth calls out
aibileen enters to find elizabeth and hilly staring at her
elizabeth is two weeks way past due
hilly licks her cold sore as she steps forward
she glides her hand across the l shaped crack in the elizabeths table drawing aibileens attention to it
aibileen the silver i lent elizabeth last week
it not polished good
humidity been fighting me on polishing day
when you returned it three pieces were missing out of the felt wrapper
a fork and two spoons
lemme go look in the kitchen maybe i left some behind

aibileen turns to elizabeth

elizabeth whispers to hilly
she says she doesnt have them

mae mobley enters the room
aibee my froat hurts
mae mobley coughs
i go get her some syrup miss leefolt
elizabeth can take care of her child
elizabeth looks to hilly appearing somewhat upset with this suggestion
ill go get the couch syrup
hilly glares at aibileen as elizabeth runs down the hall
i wont tolerate liars
mae mobley becomes scared and hides behind aibileens leg
i didnt steal no silver
im not talking about silver
im talking about those things you wrote about elizabeth
maybe i cant send you to jail for what you wrote but i can send you to jail for being a thief
and your friend minny
that nigras got a nice surprise coming to her
johnny foote listens to what i say

hilly narrows her eyes

aibileen kneels down as elizabeth returns with the syrup

aibileen squeezes mae mobley for the last time
they both cry together
hilly speaks up
you need to go now aibileen
aibileen rises up from mae mobley and turns to elizabeth
give my sweet girl a chance
elizabeth avoids eye contact
aibileen turns and walks away
as elizabeth leans down to pick up mae mobley
her water breaks
she glares at hilly with shock and regret
aibileen steps out of the house with her purse
she walks stoically down the driveway
tears stream down her face
mae mobley runs to the living room window crying
she beats on the glass from inside
aibileen never turns
mae mobley was my last baby
in just thirty minutes i felt like my whole life was done
of the thirteen maids seven of us got fired
several other maids got fired who had nothin to do with our book
guess our stories werent so unique after all
but like minny we was all free
hilly even fatter now sifts through the days mail
and wes was a lot freer than hilly holbrook
she comes across a piece from celia foote addressed to the starving children of africa fund
a smug smile forms
she opens the envelope to find a check for
made out to two slice hilly
hilly screams as she rips the check into pieces
minny folds laundry on a picnic table
ever so often we all get a nice piece of book money in the mail
manna from heaven we like to call it
minny looks across the table and smiles at celia who is holding and playing with minnys newborn child
close on tombstone born december th died march th a bouquet of flowers lay at the foot of the tombstone
a copy of the help leans against it
in the distance a cab slowly pulls away with skeeter inside
aibileen sits at her kitchen table typing on skeeters old typewriter
we watch as keys write out the rest of aibileens voice over
thousands of our books went out all over the world
we had got paid to tell the truth and we just couldnt believe it
aibileen takes this last page out of the typewriter and places it behind two hundred other typed out pages
she looks up to the framed picture of treelore and rises from the table with pride
skeeter smiles as she reads from a book in her corner office
the manhattan skyline rises behind her
she wears pucci
her hair is perfectly styled
she looks gorgeous
she sets the book down on her desk and picks up the phone
the books cover reads all my babies by aibileen clark next to the book is a glass box
constantines corn pipe rests inside
aibileen rises from a sofa
her hair is gray
reading glasses hang on a chain from around her neck
as she begins a slow walk down the hall we see the surroundings of her new home for the first time
its much bigger well furnished and beautiful
she passes a study lined with shelves of books
a copy of the help and all my babies are placed side by side
at the end of the hall aibileen approaches the opened door of a brightly lit sparkling white bathroom
she enters the bathroom and closes the door
