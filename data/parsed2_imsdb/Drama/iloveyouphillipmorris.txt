a true story of life love and prison breaks written by glenn ficarra john requa based on the book by steve mcvicker
fluffy white clouds drift across a clear blue sky
this really happened it really did a dull whine is heard building in volume until finally startled steven russell opens his eyes
gaunt and pale he seems to be on deaths door
the whine we once heard is now the high pitched alarm of medical equipment
the door bursts open
nurses enter rushing toward him
the nurses pass him and attend to the patient in the next bed over frantically administering cpr
a doctor appears and pushes the nurses aside
wheres the crash cart
he straddles the patients chest and pushes down hard the sound of a sternum cracking can be heard
steven returns his gaze to the ceiling
a cheery voice counterpoints the bleakness of this scene
upbeat and happy love sure is a funny thing
it makes you happy
makes you sad
makes you do all sorts of things you never thought youd do before
loves the reason im here actually
i love you phillip morris green pages
a group of four nine year olds lie in the grass atop a hill
they stare up at the clouds playfully arguing
i still dont see it
its right there
a young steven russell is among them
its really big
steven looks down the hill to see his mother calling
young steven sits in the middle of the couch
his parents and year old brother stand before him
he stares at them innocent and doe eyed with a big smile on his face
are you a happy little boy steven
steven smiles and nods
youve always been such a happy little boy
then now steven we want to tell you something very important but i want you to understand that it doesnt change a thing
steven awaits smiling
were still gonna love you youre still gonna be our happy little boy and youre still gonna youre adopted
i love you phillip morris green pages
he glares at his brother then turns back to his mother
her face says it all
she swats his brother in the head
steven starts putting things together
your brother overheard your dad and i talking and well we didnt want you to hear it from anybody but us
then its true
youre a special little boy
you know why
because we chose you
not like your brother here whos natural
your mothers right
its cause we love you
so we put some money in a brown paper bag and gave it to your real mom in the hospital parking lot so you could come home with us
it doesnt change a thing honey
we love you just as much as we love your brother here
best of intentions and hes natural
so son are you okay
steven smiles wide
as his parents prattle on stevens vo comes full
it hurt a bit but i decided i wasnt gonna let it get me down
i was gonna be the best son no the best person i could be
i love you phillip morris green pages
a joyous sunday
open on the letter board of the virginia beach church of god
the date reads march
a congregation packs the church to the rafters as a lawrence welk ish choir praises jesus to the tune of hallelujah
we shall rise
amidst this white mans paradise sits a smiling and healthy steven playing the organ with a happy stick planted firmly up his ass
as the joyous flock whoops it up steven winks to his wife debbie and their year old daughter stephanie who sit in the first row
steven oblivious hits a sour note or two but keeps on playing with happy abandon
the crowd continues to enjoy the inspiring hymn
a police receptionist mandi at a switchboard in a small town police station answers the phone
virginia beach police department how may i direct your call
steven enters in uniform smiling wide
mandi waves happily
she covers the receiver and whispers
something came for you
as he nods and moves on hes greeted by a various policemen
we can tell hes well liked
hey steve steve mornin etc
steven arrives at his desk to find a large file box
he turns it around to reveal writing on the side
it reads establishing of the empty parts of the home
i love you phillip morris green pages
steven switches off the small lamp beside stephanies bed
he kisses her forehead
have lots of dreams
steven and debbie kneel at the edge of the bed praying
and if it wasnt for you jesus i would have never found that last coffee filter and prayer girls would have been ruined
so thank you for that
steven moves to get up but settles back in when she continues
and thank you for steffies allergy screen coming back all negative
i always knew it was in your plan for her to enjoy nuts
and finally i want to thank you for this man jesus
this man who works so hard to make us happy without even a thought for himself
steven smiles at that sentiment
again he moves to get up when this man who pursued me to the ends of the earth and promised me a life of eternal happiness
a promise he has kept oh lord
steven tries to get up again
then i love you phillip morris green pages
sometimes when i think of how happy i am i just want to cry
like the time when you politely okay lets wrap it up
and in your gracious name i find thee and praise thee
in bed with debbie steven switches off the light and lets out a hearty yawn
im absolutely bushed
they turn on their sides back to back in the bed
after a few moments of silence steven rolls over and puts his arm around her gently feeling her breasts
debbie turns on her back and they kiss quietly as steven quietly gets on top
in moments they are rocking with the gentle rhythm of everyday sex
just as things are peaking steven suddenly stops and strikes a conversational tone
deb you know how as a cop i have lots of access
you know records and things
surprised steven oblivious now do you think its you know unethical to use that to find my mother
i love you phillip morris green pages
debbie quickly realizes where his head is at
yeah um well i dont know i swear honey getting around the systems so easy
no one would even know i did it
i know you want to find her steven but you need to think about this
youre right i shouldnt have done it
you did it
oh my god steven whatd you find
i havent looked
well lets go
she moves to get up
steven takes umbrage
well hold on let me finish
steven thrusts and tenses
there thats got it
steven flips through the file box reading through various pages
debbie watches with compassion as he reads
eventually he cracks an incredulous smile
shes right here
shes been right here all this time
i love you phillip morris green pages
its really her
my goodness steven thats wonderful
he reads on his smile ever widening until he comes across something that concerns him and his voice trails off
his smile fades replaced by a look of dread
debbie grows concerned
what is it
he cannot believe his eyes
steven walks up to a middle class home and raps on the screen door
a kindly woman mrs
bascombe arrives behind the mesh wearing a birthday party hat
alarmed is something wrong officer
are you barbra bascombe
is something wrong
is someone hurt
lip quivering in a manner of speaking yes
you gave up a baby for adoption correct
an ashen look overcomes mrs
she removes her hat
i dont think i know what youre talking about
steven can see that behind her is a small family gathering at the table grouped around a birthday cake
i love you phillip morris green pages
st judes hospital
i dont know what youre talking about
you were young
i know that you made a mistake giving me away but listen shhhhhh
mommy please let me finish
what color that remains in her face drains away
we all make mistakes
what i came here to say is i forgive you because none of us is perfect but now with a fresh start we can build she slams the door in
from behind the door i have no idea what youre talking about steven
no its okay i know everything
but its fine
just tell me why go away
its a lot at once
but i can come back
i can come back later ill bring us some coffee and we can talk about
suddenly furious tears stream down stevens face
he gets in his car and slams the door
and as he sits there trying to make sense of things
i love you phillip morris green pages
i quit the force that day
i packed up the family and moved to texas
i got a great job and got to living the american dream
the ideal suburban american barbecue is in full swing at the new russell household
in a series of brief vignettes steven shows off the house his family and his new corvette
a happy steven moves through the backyard with a plate of meat fresh off the grill
continuing past the buffet he enters the dining room to find six year old stephanie same actress happen past
steven lovingly scoops her up without a thought
i cant find my blue fish
he turns to see debbie across the room talking to a young couple
she waves him over
to stephanie in the laundry room
he puts her down and heads over to debbie and the couple
steven you havent met our new neighbors down two and across the street neil and sara
no i havent
i hope youre planning on changing the paint
what do you call that color
oh were changing it
they all burst into loud breaking the ice laughter
i love you phillip morris green pages
good good good
so debbie tells me you used to be in the police force back in georgia
yeah kinda lost interest
got back into the family business
i work for sysco
thats a big outfit
they give you that corvette out there
yes sir ee
great benefits too
and the hours dont crush me either
i get plenty of home time
its good to have him where i can keep an eye on him
suggestive among other things
debbie gives an embarrassed guffaw as he smooches on her
i love you phillip morris green pages
and as they giggle and play wrestle
amidst the moonlit shadows the thumping of vigorous lovemaking is heard
it continues getting louder and louder until we make out two forms doing it doggie style in the bed
building to the climax steven moans with pleasure
im gonna come im gonna come
suddenly we see the face of the moustached man hes fucking
we are back with steven in his hospital bed at the penitentiary
oh did i forget to mention i was gay
yeah sorry about that
gay gay gay gay gay
have been as long as i can remember
were back on the hilltop from the beginning of the movie
nine year old steven and his three young friends crest the verdant hill running and laughing through the backlit dandelion fluff of an idyllic summer day
they all collapse into the long grass like the splayed arms of a starfish
catching their breath they stare up at the sky searching for shapes in the clouds
i see a pony
what do you see
i love you phillip morris green pages
i see a diesel train
i see a whirlybird
i see a wiener
they look at him with incredulity
what kind of wiener
a mans wiener
theres no wiener
no theres not
there is a long silence
then oh i see it
there it is
and as the other boys squint closely
anyway where was i
oh yeah once again the moustached man throws his head back in the throes of lust
steven drives it home
i love you phillip morris green pages
matter of fact and i did
the moustached man and steven say goodbye at the door
i had been living a lie for a long long time
i tend to do that
you be careful out there youre a little drunk
steven drives his red corvette hard top removed with a contented look on his face
he glows as the pet shop boys west end girls plays on the radio
now just because i was screwing around doesnt mean i didnt love debbie
i loved her with all my heart
my family was all i had and they needed me
so i told myself it was just a little lie and it was better for everybody if it stayed that way
beat thats what i told myself
but life has a way of forcing these things into the light
a crossing pickup truck smashes into the driver side door violently propelling steven and his corvette out of frame
you might even call it an epiphany
badly mangled and triaged steven stares intently at the night sky with his one good eye as paramedics remove him from the ditch on a back board
the remains of the corvette are all around
i love you phillip morris green pages
low murmur i havent lived my life
try not to talk sir
bleary fuck you
no one is going to tell me what to do anymore
no more lies
im going to live my life
be the real me
time for some good living
buy what i want do what i want fuck who i want
okay sir whatever you say
im gonna be a fag
a big fag
to other paramedic lets move
debbie walks alongside a doctor deeply concerned and listening to his assessment
yep just like that i decided to start my life over and live it like the real me
no more lies
i was born again
debbie enters the room to find steven bandaged and bristling with tubes
it would be hard to break it to debbie but i knew id find a way
i love you phillip morris green pages
he turns his head to her and smiles wide
honey im gay
debbie freezes she cant believe her ears
and as she stares at his smiling face in shock
to my surprise we stayed friends
then and i was finally free
vintage mambo music
palm trees line an upscale palm beach shopping district
well heeled nabobs cruise the boulevard shopping and being seen
two miniature doberman pinschers on a tandem leash appear from around a corner soon followed by the new steven with a handsome young man on his arm jimmy kemple
stevens pajama like clothes perfect tan and loose demeanor make him the very essence of a man with new found freedoms
life was good
everything was falling right into place
i moved to florida got a new job had two adorable pups i was dating a cute guy named jimmy
i could do anything i wanted
dance music thumps as steven passes around a tray of drinks to friends
but it didnt take me long to realize something that never occurred to me before
actually no one ever talks about this but
when everyone is served he raises his glass and lets loose a party hoot
they concur and drink
i love you phillip morris green pages
being gay is really expensive
beat it is
steven leans over and makes out with kemple
quick cuts of steven enjoying his gay life with kemple at restaurants etc
i mean its not just sucking cock
its wardrobe its hair personal trainers big labels resorts fine dining
it goes on and on and on
so i needed money
and for a guy without a college education my options were limited
steven inexplicably pours cooking oil out onto a grocery store aisle with a basket slung over his arm
so i had no choice beat giddy i became a con man
steven throws himself in the air and falls flat on his back with a scream
of course that was easy for me every closet case is a con anyways
and as people gather around he grasps his neck and moans litigiously open close on a paralegal
she opens a briefcase and removes an envelope
cut to reveal steven holding crutches at his side across from a few lawyers
the paralegal hands him the envelope
i love you phillip morris green pages
with great difficulty steven gets on his crutches and makes his exit
now it didnt happen all at once
it was sort of a gradual thing
an old warehouse manager emerges from a darkened amity foodservice trailer with a crate of tomatoes in hand
as he steps out onto the dock he passes steven who is talking with a pound produce manager
tomato crates are all around
it started with work
i used to buy low grade tomatoes in the field and sell them to clueless chain stores as higher grade
these are gorgeous
big smile finest in the land
and as they talk its called field buying
i could clear three thousand dollars in a good week doing that
but frankly it wasnt enough
steven stands before a salesperson at a counter
cash or charge
steven flips through a handful of identical credit cards
i love you phillip morris green pages
sotto steven a russell steven g russell steven m russell doctor steven m russell doctor steven j russell
seeing one he likes ah
he gives a card to a smiling saleswoman
reading card mister evans
can i see some id
and as steven riffles through an equally large stack of steven stands atop a escalator looking around
but when money got really tight the slip and fall always came in handy
he throws himself down the escalator out of frame to the floor below
painful tumbling is heard
at the bottom of the escalator a hard thud is heard
a beat later stevens feet slide into frame
dressed in pajamas steven and kemple sit cross legged at the base of their christmas tree surrounded by torn paper and strewn gifts
stevens arm is in a cast
kemple opens a hinged case to reveal a gold rolex watch
what do you think
i love you phillip morris green pages
well steven its beautiful
it really is
you dont like it
no no no
you dont like it
dont listen to me
tell me whats wrong with it
is it the gold
thats why i got you the stainless
he takes out another box and hands it to kemple
as he opens it steven grabs the gold rolex
the gold one is for me dipshit
kemple smiles broadly as he admires his new watch
the phone rings
steven rushes to answer it
debbie on the phone is intercut
stephanie is in the background opening gifts at the base of their tree
i love you phillip morris green pages
did you get the gifts
well thats why im calling
cut wide to reveal a gift box filled with stacks of cash
i cant keep this
its not christian
this is not what the lord wants
so youre saying you know what the lord wants
i would never say that
do you think this is what he wants
its the leap of faith deb
its the not knowing thats the answer
this gets traction with debbie
well i never thought about it that way
cut to reveal stephanie has her own box of cash
i love you phillip morris green pages
and as steven listens to debbies rant of course jimmy and debbie had no idea what i was up to
for the time being at least
steven exits an elevator and saunters into work happy as ever
he passes the amity foodservice logo and a cherubic morning sandy
you have visitors
steven quickly gets a deeply concerned look on his face as he approaches his office
the door is slightly ajar
he secretly peeks in to see
two federal marshalls wait in stevens office
he instantly knows whats going on
steven paces nervously outside the elevator growing more and more anxious as he waits
they wanted me for all sorts of stuff insurance fraud identity theft passport fraud
they were probably gonna extradite me all the way back to texas
i had to decide what to do next
i love you phillip morris green pages
stevens ford bronco cruises past the apartment building to find a few police cars parked outside
he drives on
steven blubbers to himself inside his bronco which is parked in a bleak lot near a looming billboard
but one thing was for sure i was not gonna let them put me away
i was a cop and i knew what jail was like
and there was no way i was going there
i had a plan
he continues to cry uncontrollably as he raises a prescription bottle and dumps all the pills into his mouth
he reaches into the back seat and pulls out a bottle of galliano to wash it down
he starts up the car
everything was gonna be just fine
cars pass through frame quickly heading wherever it is they are going
moments later a car horn is heard incessantly blaring and building in volume until stevens car idles into frame at mph
the heights how do you talk to an angel is barely audible over the car horn and steven is slumped over the steering wheel
moments later it veers off down into the grassy shoulder and out of frame
steven awakes in a hospital bed
he looks around and eventually looks through the observation glass into the hallway
he sees debbie talking to a cop
i love you phillip morris green pages
he readjusts to see jimmy sitting nearby
why didnt you tell me
i cant go to prison jimmy
i cant go to prison
okay okay calm down
i just want to tell them youre awake and we can take it from there
confident that steven is calm jimmy steps into the hall
jimmy joins debbie and the cop in the hallway
steven is visible in bed through the glass
did you know steven was wanted
not until just now
he likes to keep little secrets sometimes
like the fact that he was a big queer
yeah like that
but suicide my god
well he does tend to overreact
i feel like i dont even know him
i love you phillip morris green pages
well jimmy thats the thing
im not really sure he knows who he is
hes searching at least thats how i figure it
im just not sure he knows what it is hes looking for
to cop can you tell me exactly what he did
as they continue to talk they fail to notice steven getting out of bed and looking around blearily
he picks up a bedpan reaches into his gown and absent mindedly pisses missing the pan completely
he has several warrants out in texas
fraud forgery embezzlement
i should have known
i should have said something
dont blame yourself jimmy
i did the same thing
there were always signs
i should have known he was gay when he started shaving his chest
that would be a warning sign
and all that peter allen music on his walkman
denial is a powerful thing
i dont feel so bad now
i just never thought
but now stealing
hes probably been doing it for years
i say to myself he did it just to buy me things but i dont think thats true
i love you phillip morris green pages
its bigger than that
but why then
and why suicide
i mean just like that
after that he dresses and walks out the door behind them
i know he seemed so happy and just then debbie notices steven is not in bed and looks up in time to see him disappearing around the corner
debbie kemple and the cop exit the hospital and look around frantically
they spot him running across the open air lot and give chase
steven comes to a stairwell door
he runs some more and finds himself cornered at the guard rail
kemple debbie and the cop slowly approach
steven glances over the guard rail
one floor down is an opened steven
steven looks down again
kemple knows what hes thinking
steven looks down
the soft bags of trash below beckon him to freedom
steven im serious
you stop or youll never see me again
no response i mean it
i love you phillip morris green pages
steven looks to kemple and then to the cop right behind him
he jumps and they run to the guard rail and look over to see steven lies moaning and delirious on his back next to the as inmates chant and stomp
a new inmate walks the line to his new cell clutching his prison issue belongings
although we can only see him from behind we can only assume this is steven
he continues his walk amidst a shower of stares and jeers and threats raining upon him
yelling the unseen inmate continues past the open cells of his new home and eventually the unseen inmate enters a cell to find steven is reclined on his bunk relaxed
and ready to greet the inmate his new cellmate arnie with a smile
welcome to prison
arnie is scared
oh dont worry im not gonna hurt you
shit i was so scared when i first got here
but you get used to it
i love you phillip morris green pages
only took me a year
you just need to know a few ins and outs and youll be fine
steven escorts arnie through the prison waving to various inmates and guards along the way
upbeat youre gonna catch a beating any day now thats just the way it is
i lost three teeth and cracked a vertebrae
anyway all you need to do is fight back
win or lose just fight back
then or you could try to suck the guys dick
he moves on
steven and arnie stand at the door of the prisons law library
i pretty much live here
i dont really have anyone on the outside except my ex wife so i just hunker down here learning everything there is to know about the law
ask me anything
arnie has no response
steven points across the library where a menacing older inmate studies a law book
anything you want from outside hes the guy
candy cigarettes drugs whatever
hes the guy
then just keep in mind its gonna cost you a lot of money
or you could suck his dick
steven and arnie stand outside the empty cafeteria
i love you phillip morris green pages
three meals a day
not so bad
just make sure if you make enemies with someone he doesnt work here
otherwise youll wake up one morning shitting blood and find out youve been eating ground glass in your cornbread for six weeks
arnie notices one of the inmates working in the kitchen spitting a loogey into the mashed potatoes
he mixes it in and cackles with glee
steven pays no mind
let me introduce you to the mail guy
his names gary
a mean looking con named gary mans a mail cart while he talks with steven and arnie
mid sentence letters magazines shit like that it all goes through unmolested
but if grandmas sending you cookies or porn or brownies or whatever youre gonna have to pay for it if you wanna get it
five bucks per item or you can suck my dick
steven turns to arnie
steven and arnie arrive at the doorway of their cell
well thats about it
youre gonna be fine
and if you need anything you just let me know
arnie thinks a moment
so uh do i need to suck your dick
i love you phillip morris green pages
thatd be great
steven gently shoves his new cellmate into the cell
steven is on one of the many pay phones
hi this is debbie and steffie
sorry we missed you
leave a message
sorry i missed you
i thought one oclock was our time but maybe not
i sure miss you guys
thanks for the picture and the article
sometimes its just nice to know theres someone out there who still cares about me since jimmy left and all
steven is holding the stainless steel rolex he gave kemple as a gift
he regards it wistfully
thinking drifting do you think i broke his heart
snapping out of it sorry
sometimes i forget its just the machine
ill try you again next time
he hangs up
bored and lonely he has a moment of repose
just then a loud ruckus across the common area gets his attention
steven watches as a group of rowdy prisoners throw whatever they can find at a small bird as it flies around trapped in the cavernous hall
the men laugh and hoot as the bird is struck down and lies motionless on the ground
as the prisoners resume their activities steven notices a gentle looking inmate approaching the bird
rapt steven watches as the inmate sympathetically scoops up the bird and walks off
steven is quite taken
i love you phillip morris green pages
the gentle inmate phillip morris is a slightly built handsome blonde boy man
he struggles to reach a book on a high shelf
helpless and irresistible he is surprised when steven reaches in to help retrieve the book
their eyes lock and they stare in a short silence until slightly blanche dubois thanks
guess i need a few extra inches
glad to help
hows the bird
hes at peace
oh im sorry
it was for the best
he was suffering
steven acknowledges his kindness with a smile
referring to law book civil law
you know im an attorney
you suing someone
i dont know what im doing
theres a guy i know hes in the infirmary now
hes sick hes real sick
i thought maybe i could find a way to get him some help i mean real help
i dont know maybe i could i dont even know what im looking for
steven is intrigued
does he have a lawyer
i love you phillip morris green pages
have him get in touch with the prisoner rights committee
they deal with this all the time pro bono
ive got the number
well thank you i my names steven russell
pleased to meet you steven russell my names phillip morris

i love you phillip morris green pages
damn were both in a mess arent we

oh listen to you gloomy gus
i think youre gonna be just fine steven russell
steven takes this to heart
playful i guess im inclined to believe you
i met you today didnt i
steven sits close to phillip at a table
a large open law text lies between them
mid sentence i made the mistake of writing her and saying i was lonely in here
and next thing you know my ex wife catches her putting the neighbors puppy in a box to mail to me
ohhhhh she sounds so sweet
i love you phillip morris green pages
oh shes an angel
then i think ill be sure to write her back and tell her im not lonely anymore
that i made a good friend
phillip smirks for a moment but soon steven notices the smirk turn to a reticent frown
whyd i have to meet you today
its just im being transferred to michael unit today
dont be sorry
its just across the yard
well i dont go into that yard so it might as well be oklahoma
then just figures with my luck

in fact friday the ths my lucky day
dont worry this right here
this is destiny
but we only just met
listen ive loved a lot
and ive been around so i recognize the feeling
i love you phillip morris green pages
that one you and me are having right now the one youre trying to forget exists because youre going away
but theres about volts shooting across this table here and you know you cant deny it
dont you think youre coming on a little strong
i know youre trying to protect yourself i get that
give me a chance to prove you wrong
phillip is melting but tries to hide it
im sure i dont know what youre talking about
steven smiles wide as if to throw down the gauntlet
phillip turns to walk away and hides his giddyness
phillip passes the cells of michael unit clutching his belongings and soon enters his cell
he looks around sheepishly until he is interrupted you phillip
phillip turns to see cleavon a huge black inmate mopping the hall outside his cell yes
he tosses phillip a folded note
he catches it and looks at it with a smile
phillip opens it up
as he reads his face brightens considerably
i love you phillip morris green pages
phillip hope your new place is nice
nice enough anyway
i hope the chocolate made it to you okay
check the t
phillip looks at the spare roll of toilet paper and turns it over
a small chocolate bar is stuck in the tube
i hope you try to make some new friends and not be too shy
i guess i should tell you a little bit about myself
open close on a note as phillip scrawls it
i keep thinking about you saying im shy
i guess youre right but i dont feel shy around you
i think that means something
as his vo continues phillip folds up the paper and passes it through the bars back to cleavon
various shots as we follow the note being passed by different hands and means throughout the prison on its way to steven
anyway thanks for the chocolate but i should tell you im diabetic so i probably shouldnt
but i did anyway
its been so long since anyones shown me any kindness and well it means a lot
i just wish you were here
steven reads the letter on his bunk
write me back soon
steven finishes the letter and folds it up looking strangely expressionless
i love you phillip morris green pages
phillip peers out of his cell to see cleavon working his way nearer with his mop
moments later cleavon passes him by
phillip is bummed
again phillip watches as cleavon passes his cell without leaving a note
phillip lays in bed impatiently
he seems upset
he anxiously peers out the bars and catches a glimpse of the mopping cleavon working his way closer to his cell
hurry up would you
i aint no motherfucking dhl faggot
besides i aint got nothing for you anyway
but its been three days
you got a tracking number motherfucker
then shut your faggot ass
phillip slumps back onto his bed depressed
congratulations phillip scared off another one
a few moments later hes startled by the clang of his cell door sliding open
he looks up a corrections officer stands over him
morris you got a new roommate
i love you phillip morris green pages
this is no consolation to phillip
he heaves a heavy sigh until he sees steven enter his cell clutching a pile of belongings
phillip is overwhelmed as the cell door slams shut behind steven
oh my god
how the hell did you do this
steven slowly moves closer
i know a guy
i took care of it
im gonna take care of everything
steven gently caresses phillips face
phillip is melting
then suddenly phillip grabs stevens ass
enough romance lets fuck
they launch themselves onto the bunk and as they get to business
phillip and steven spoon in a glowing post coital cuddle
and for a while i was executive assistant to a broadway producer
whats a broadway producer doing in atlanta
i didnt ask
whatd you do for him
i mainly just rode around town in his limo drinking and sucking him off
theres a moment of silence then a realization
i love you phillip morris green pages
now that i hear myself say it i think he was just some rich chicken hawk
they get a giggle out of this
oh well he was a nice guy
i only dated him for a little while anyway
then i dated this full blooded apache who made me dress up like a baseball player
what was his name
phillip you amaze me
he was a nice guy too
thats what im saying you only see the good
phillip shrugs but before he can reply a piercing human screech interrupts him
what the hell was that
the inmate who spit a loogey into the mashed potatoes in the cafeteria is sitting up on his bed screeching at the top of his lungs
this is the screecher phillip continues to talk
thats the screecher next door
he does it all night
i never get any sleep
he drives me crazy
you poor thing
i love you phillip morris green pages
the screecher continues his routine
phillip emerges from the line munching on a candy bar when he notices a ruckus on the other side of the fence
he wanders over to see a large prisoner beating the crap out of the screecher
im gonna cut out your motherfucking tongue with your screeching all night
as guards descend on the two the large prisoner continues to beat on the screeching screecher
phillip sidles up next to a bald prisoner
what does he care he aint in our block
someone probably paid him
reclined on his bunk steven does a crossword puzzle
phillip enters standing by the door
steven sits up
did you pay to have the screecher beat up
dont bullshit me
did you pay to have him beat up
i love you phillip morris green pages
well you said he bothered you
just answer me
yeah i did
a tear comes to phillips eye
this is the most romantic thing anyones ever done for me
he clamps onto steven and hugs with all his life
i just want you to be happy baby
you are so amazing
and as they roll on the bed playfully
cleavon lays on his cot staring at the ceiling
eventually a hand enters through the bars holding a cassette tape
cleavon put this in
no man not now
phillips hand disappears for a moment and comes back with a five dollar bill
i love you phillip morris green pages
but you gotta play the whole thing
fuck you my words my bond motherfucker
cleavon takes the cash and puts the tape in a boom box
a familiar romantic tune begins to play
fuck man johnny mathis
fucking white ass nigger
he buries his head in the pillow as chances are plays
as the music seeps into their dark cell steven reads a law book by pen light
phillip grabs stevens hand and tries to pull him off the bed
i cant dance
yes you can
no i cant
honey youre queer it comes with the package
well not me
i love you phillip morris green pages
cmon ill show you
he drags him up and begins his lesson
hold me here
steven stumbles his way through the slow dance for a while but with phillips help he begins to settle in
soon they are nestled into each other swaying sweetly to the music
the music continues as a group of prisoners watch a vhs copy of ghost on a tv
phillip wipes away a tear and steven holds him closer while in the front row a one eyed latino jerks off to the sight of demi moore
yeah you fucking bitch
music continues as tray after tray is filled with gray slop
this persists until suddenly two of the trays receive a beautiful steak and some shrimp
steven nods at the slopmaster and offers a wink to a very impressed phillip
music continues as phillip and steven shave side by side smiling at one another
music plays on as steven and phillip continue their romantic dance
they are unfazed as the lights in the cellblock go out with the loud sound of circuits tripping
they dance on
i love you phillip morris green pages
eventually the hollow sound of johnny mathis reverberating through the block is the only thing we hear
they dance on
they continue to dance
footsteps approaching are heard
i said lights out
turn it off
fuck you pig
turn it off or were coming in
well come on in
i got a dick that needs sucking
offscreen we hear the cell door open and the sound of a scuffle is heard
and as the sounds of a horrendous beating echo through the cellblock phillip and steven dance their dance oblivious to all but each other
phillip and steven sleep soundly together in the bunk
a claxon blares and their cell door opens accompanied by the sound of a dozen others
rise and shine
they barely stir until clang clang clang
a guard hits the bars with his club
steven and phillip are rudely awakened
i love you phillip morris green pages
grab your shit
the guards enter to roust steven
nonney snitched you out about the screecher
youre going to ramsey two
they grab steven and yank him out of the cell
phillip tries to follow but a guard knocks him back down onto the bunk
dont you touch him
steven dont worry phillip ill shut up and move
they drag him off
phillip watches with deep worry as another guard keeps him there
he grows more and more upset pacing and working himself up
finally the guard leaves and phillip exits his cell and bolts down the tier after steven
phillip runs after steven quickly arriving at a locked gate
steven is on the other side still being escorted away
phillip is forced to find an alternative route
phillip marches through the common area fighting tears
i love you phillip morris green pages
phillip runs through another cell block until he comes to a window
he looks outside
phillips pov steven is waiting in line with some other prisoners to board a bus
phillip can be seen through the small window but he fails to get stevens attention
he bangs silently on the glass
phillip continues in vain to get stevens attention
he sees the line at the sally port start to move and stops to think
he knows what he has to do
phillip runs down a breezeway
eventually he reaches a heavily populated gate manned by a yard guard
i wanna go in the yard
hold your horses dorothy
the yard guard pushes a button that opens the gate and phillip bursts through
i love you phillip morris green pages
phillip runs through the yard passing giant wolf whistling inmates as they put down their weights and stop their basketball games
phillip maintains his focus on the sally port on the other side of the far fence
boarding the bus steven hears him and turns
delighted hes forced on board by a guard before he can respond
steven gets in his seat and yells out the window
what the hell are you doing
i love you
i love you too
the bus starts up and begins to move
well be together soon
the bus drives off
phillip runs along with it for a while as they share a long goodbye
and eventually the bus disappears from view
phillip clings to the fence a moment hanging on to hope
he slumps and turns only to find himself confronted by several hulking members of the aryan brotherhood with one thing on their minds
phillip marches right toward them and as he draws close startled they split to let phillip pass unmolested
i love you phillip morris green pages
back in the present steven remains in his hospital bed at the penitentiary infirmary
those were the longest three months of my life
i wrote to phillip every day until i got released
the gate of the prison closes behind steven as he exits
he approaches a waiting taxi
and once i did i was determined to get us back together as soon as possible
steven gets in
hi how are you
where you headed
nearest thrift store please
you mind if i tell you the word of our lord jesus christ
the car pulls out the prison receding behind them
the same taxi pulls up in front of the prison and steven emerges with a briefcase wearing a three piece suit
he rings the buzzer at the front gate
steven approaches the duty officer
i love you phillip morris green pages
hi there my names steven rousseau
im an attorney
my client is phillip morris
i called earlier
the guard checks his roster
there you are
like the cigarette huh
i beg your pardon
phillip enters to see steven waiting for him on the other side of the glass
thrilled he rushes to the phone
you said youd come right away but jesus
i got work to do honey im getting you out of here early
i got a hearing tomorrow morning i got motions to file
the law dont sleep baby
i love you so much
phillip you are the sweetest most gentle man i have ever met
and i know people have taken advantage of that
but i dont ever want you ever to lose that innocence
i want to build a life with you phillip
i want to protect you
they share a smile
get me out of here
steven stands over a desk talking sternly into a telephone
i love you phillip morris green pages
the motion was filed i presented to the da and got a letter from the judge i do not understand what the hold up is
im not some paralegal i am steven fucking rousseau and i expect proper adjudication
pullout to reveal hes actually standing behind a kroegers supermarket deli counter in uniform as a housewife waits impatiently
he hangs up
big smile my boyfriends getting out of prison next week
she smiles back
you want mayo with that
steven slides paperwork through a slot in plexiglass window toward a release officer
i have an early release order for phillip morris
the officer glances at the paperwork
yep morris we got him right here waiting
the door begins to open as the officer stamps some of the paperwork
and you are
im his lawyer
phillip runs into his arms
as they kiss the officer offers a surprised look
i love you phillip morris green pages
a party to celebrate phillips release
steven and phillip stand at the door as friends file in and greet him boisterously
its so good to see you
another friend enters
oh my god
you look great
prison agreed with you
how do i get on that diet
oh you couldnt handle it not unless we smuggled an espresso machine in a cake
throw in a sicilian barista and im there
this is steven
steven blake and baylor
gasp this is him
this is your gay lawyer prison boyfriend
pleased to meet you
much better than the guy who had you kidnapped
what was his name
steven looks to phillip perplexed
regroups to others can i get you all a drink
i love you phillip morris green pages
steven works his way through the crowded apartment struggling to hold a few cocktail glasses for guests
he eventually arrives next to phillip who is having a great time with another friend and older woman named we gotta get a bigger place
steven i want you to meet my old neighbor eudora mixon
she is just the sweetest
eudora owns a little building in montrose and shes having a hell of time with the builder
he sounds like a real asshole
his plans were useless and hes trying to sue me to pay him
i need your expertise steven
phillip says maybe you can help
i could certainly try
can you still practice law having been to prison
sure why not
i just thought oh what do i know
id just be glad to have someone i could trust
ill pay your normal fee
steven doesnt miss a beat
he smiles wide
it would be my pleasure
litigation is my speciality
phillip beams with pride over stevens decision
i love you phillip morris green pages
eudora waits on a bench in the corridor nervously glancing at her watch
steven stands behind a column down the hall hiding and watching
he looks at his watch then approaches her
sorry im late but ive been hung up in court all day
lets go in
stevens pov a beautifully ornate courthouse light fixture hangs from a courthouse ceiling
on steven staring up at it with admiration
steven snaps out of it and responds to a waiting judge
its a beautiful fixture
its your turn
then your honor ms
mixon engaged mr
gage service in good faith and was given an inferior product
she is entitled to deem that work to be unacceptable according to the contract that mr
the terms of that contract were ambiguous at best
the truth is defendant engaged my client for three years without full payment
your honor i have in my briefcase fourteen other contracts all on public record in which mr
evans entered into litigation with past clients of his
eudora glances into stevens opened briefcase
it contains only a sandwich and a photo of phillip
i love you phillip morris green pages
the shocked lawyer turns to his client evans
whispers is this true
youre making me look like an idiot
he regroups and addresses the judge
your honor i dont have to tell you that none of this is admissable or applicable to the case at hand
russells histrionics do not erase the fact that his client is in breech of contract
he is right mr
russell what do you have to say
steven is stonewalled
he looks to eudora as if to say what do i do now
and it terrifies her
desperate steven bangs his fist on the table and looks resolutely to the judge
i demand to be seen in chambers
the judge and lawyer seem mystified by this response
the lawyer sits impatiently while steven peruses a wall of plaques photos and diplomas
he focuses on a law school degree from indiana college of law
next to it a photo of the judge as a young man on a farm
hes from humble roots
a moment later the judge enters
okay gentlemen lets get this over with the two for one at the crab boiler ends at five oclock
i love you phillip morris green pages
this seems to be cut and dried here sir
i dont even know why were back here
mister russell is treating this like an episode of matlock
ill admit your honor im a plain spoken man
i didnt go to princeton
i didnt go to yale
my education was modest
i went to a small school
i grew up on a small farm
but i passed the same bar exam as my colleague here and i am not going to let him push around this humble woman
this scores with the judge
point taken mister russell
he glares at the other lawyer with scorn
but where are you going with this
i think its obvious where im going with this sir
a long silence
the judge waits and waits until something occurs to him
are you talking about marshall vs
steven doesnt know what this means
but the other lawyer does
and hes not happy
seeing this steven puffs with confidence
your honor thats exactly what im talking about
the judge slowly nods to himself as he considers this
i love you phillip morris green pages
outside the courtroom with eudora steven is ecstatic
i did great
can you believe how great i did
you did very well steven
i mean i did great
im so proud of myself
you want half my sandwich
were going out
phillip stands flabbergasted next to steven in the middle of a large modern apartment
oh my god its amazing
i thought youd like it honey
can we afford this
you let me worry about the money sweetheart
okay well i guess i better start packing boxes
not this weekend
i love you phillip morris green pages
i think we both need a vacation
palm trees undulate on the constant breeze inviting us to a beautifully solitary cove
eventually steven and phillips voices are heard
ive been meaning to ask you something
dialogue continues over various shots of their romantic getaway to the keys
in a series of shots we see where theyve been and what theyve been doing in the moments after theyve been there
a hammock blowing in the breeze
a quaint cottage nestled in the vegetation
half empty glasses of beer on the porch
dirty dishes in the cottage sink
the remains of a romantic meal on a table
the swaying palms are visible through the windows
footsteps in the sand
two beach chairs facing the surf
that birthday cake you got me in the pen
whered you get those candles
oh you know
people i knew
yeah i know
i love you phillip morris green pages
remember that guard
smoked a lot
he couldnt been more than pounds
yeah thats him
oh he was such an asshole
actually i was in the yard once
another guard asked him to pay him back five
he opened his wallet and i saw this picture of a little girl about steffies age
so i brought it up to him once just to get him talking
thats the thing about having kids you know
gets people talking
something i learned
anyway he tells me hes worried about her mamma was gone
we talked awhile
you know i just listened
i brought up the candles just one time but mostly just listened
and the next day bedtime there they were
the dialogue continues on the beach as we finally see steven and phillip enjoying the sunset by the light of a small fire on the beach
howd you know hed do that
i just knew i wanted em for you
and i found a way to do it
phillip smiles eyes never leaving the sunset
just listenin huh
i love you phillip morris green pages
and as the sun sets on the shimmering water an empty foot motorboat bobs atop placid seas fishing poles dangling over the side
the sound of two men enjoying themselves can be heard
after reaching their inevitable conclusion the voices gasp for air
winded im gonna get a coke
you want a coke
phillip spits something over the railing
aw you dont love me
and as phillip smiles and wipe his chin
with phillip i felt strong
i felt invincible
i promised myself he would never want for anything ever again
that meant i needed a real job
and no more scams
a bored steven waits in the middle of a big wigs office
he looks at photos on a nearby wall of a broad shouldered all american man dressed in a nasa jump suit performing various astronautical training tasks
he picks up a small astronaut figurine and examines it
sorry to keep you waiting steven
steven turns to find dan lindholm the broad shouldered man himself
im dan lindholm
i love you phillip morris green pages
were you a spaceman
never got out there though
nasas a real political place
never could figure out whose ass to kiss to get a mission
then all in the past
barely even think about it now
cut to reveal a huge model of the space shuttle that engulfs half the room
steven puts the figurine back
a spaceman huh
how do you crap up there
draws on his coffee have a seat
steven sits across the desk from lindholm
with the popularity of hmos in todays health care system doctors need help managing their billing so they can focus on their patients
thats where usa medical management comes in
hundreds of millions of dollars pass through our system from the hmos to the doctors
its a critical business
a powerful business
beat so when i read your resume i wasnt sure what to think
your level of education and your past experience would factor heavily into this decision and frankly
steven deflates in expectation
you were head and shoulders above the rest
i mean i could hardly believe it
but when i called your references well they couldnt speak more highly of you
i love you phillip morris green pages
steven makes breakfast in his tightie whities while talking on the phone
phillip is in the background doing a crossword puzzle at the kitchen table
i could not speak more highly of steven russell mr
a real straight shooter
we were damn lucky to have him at prudential as long as we did
in his own world phillip chimes in
brandos wet debut
steven covers the phone with his hand
on the waterfront
dan continues to wax on about steven
employee of the year two years running
developing software with ibm
youre the kind of people we need here steven
we want you as our chief financial officer
so what do you say
i want your answer right now
cmon steven lets light this candle
as steven pretends to mull an uptight assistant rheba leads steven into his fancy new office
for example hes in a meeting sounds better than hes away from his desk at least i think so but whatever you prefer
i love you phillip morris green pages
she leads him to his new desk which is stacked with folders files printouts and reams of data
i pulled all the claims for the last two years as well as the statements transfers and confirmations from the bank
most of its routine and i think you can get up to speed in a day or two
then anything else i can do for you
cup of coffee
ill do it today but i dont do that really
steven nods and turns his attention to the sea of numbers before him
he looks concerned as he begins to leaf through
steven sits in a board meeting surrounded by all of the company honchos
dan lindholm lords over the gathering at the head of the table while a suit mark reads from a report to the group
crossover from traditional markets shows declination and inverse diffusion seems commensurate with net trade trending
hmo penetration still leads ppo nmo and fmo as usual but attenuation is growing more prevalent in q as projected
as for q well q is what q always is q with training wheels
everyone laughs but no one quite as hard as steven who desperately tries to fit in
larry birkheim the ceo of usamm sits beside dan lindholm
he chimes in
okay steven your turn
i know youve only had the one quarter to play catch up but i tell you we cant wait to get some insight here
i love you phillip morris green pages
they seem kind of flat
steven fumbles through some folders and vamps a while
well i did a lot of work here and uh
i think maybe
well i could just read it to you but uh
it might be better to just uh
the group looks at him quizzically
just as it seems steven has been up to nothing well ill just show you
todd an incredibly hot assistant unveils an easel full of detailed tables
steven walks the board through an incredibly well prepared presentation
if you look here at marks projections again for q youll see well youll see theyre just that projections
projections based on a model set by my predecessor
i decided to reject that model and do things a little differently
i want to show you my results
this is what we actually made in q todd flips to the next card
the graphs grow exponentially
the group is intrigued
now let me tell you how i did it
todd unveils another card the men are impressed by the unseen image
and as steven explains himself dan and birkheim smile broadly and turn to each other with smug assurance
i love you phillip morris green pages
open close on a candy wrapper opening
a hand removes the candy revealing an inspiring message printed inside the wrapper when two hearts race both win
hes deeply touched by the sentiment as he chews on the candy
he puts the wrapper on the refrigerator with a magnet
he opens another
he chews and reads commit random acts of kindness again hes touched and puts it on the refrigerator
he opens another and pops the candy in his mouth
he reads a smile is a flower on your face hes disgusted by the trite sentiment and throws the wrapper in the trash
a beat later he removes the candy from his mouth and throws that in the trash too
just then steven walks by in a tuxedo adjusting his tie
where are you going
its just a work thing
were we supposed to no i just thought its fine
where you going
some stupid gala ball thing
playing it off sounds boring
ill be home early
a black tie cocktail party is in full swing
steven eats a canape by a window
something outside catches his eye
i love you phillip morris green pages
dan lindholm is out on the balcony staring up at the starry sky
you see that
dan points out a small dot of light moving across the sky
realizing oh is it
probably deploying the arm right now
just a satellite deployment
just touching the face of god
he chokes back a tear then throws an arm around steven
i want you to meet my wife
dan lindholm escorts steven to beverly lindholm and a ghastly gaggle of texas society wives
bev ladies i want you to meet steven russell our cfo
oh i heard about you
good things i hope
yes and no
dons bellyaching about how big your christmas bonus is gonna be because youre making him so much money
a giggle infects the group
another wife speaks up
are you married steven
i love you phillip morris green pages
well where is she sweetheart
travels a lot
its killing her she couldnt be here
and as the wives fret symathetically steven saunters over to vera the company accountant who is stamping some checks
he places some papers on her desk
these are ready for dan
you doin good
i just got back from my lawyers office
i asked him whats your fee
he says i charge for three questions
so i ask dont you think thats a little expensive
and he says yes it is
now whats your final question
vera explodes with laughter
its so true
she turns to a colleague
come here you gotta hear this
steven sits at a high powered lunch with dan lindholm and larry birkheim
he is diligently taking notes
thats the thing about the back nine at pebble beach
i love you phillip morris green pages
i dont care what your handicap is
that sand wedge is gonna get a workout i couldnt agree with you more
i remember one time i was at augusta
as dan prattles on steven continues to write on his pad
cut to reveal hes doodling pictures of smiley steven refills his mug of coffee while in the background two secretaries dish
the woman says thats awful expensive isnt it
and the lawyer says yes and now you only got one question left
she laughs louder than the woman listening to the joke
cause he already asked the two
they both laugh loudly now as steven exits
steven and dan lindholm stand at the omelette station at a high class brunch buffet
to cook mushroom and cheese
to steven anyway like i was saying the northrup guy says to the nasa well that questions gonna cost fifty million to answer so nasa says dont you think thats
a lot of money
and northrup says yep now you owe us another fifty million
next question please
this sounds eerily familiar
steven laughs a courtesy yeah thats a good one
i love you phillip morris green pages
thats why theres so few shuttle missions
theyre wasting all their money on bureaucracy
then like people care if theres life on mars
to cook no mushrooms i said
phillip test his blood sugar by applying a test strip to his bloody thumb
he compares the strip to small card with a blood sugar chart
contented with the result he puts the everything away in a small black leather bag containing insulin and steven passes by in the background with a brand new bag of
phillip is instantly puzzled
youre a homosexual
you know you can tell them
they cant fire you for being gay
im trying to be understanding here honey but golf
why not just eat pussy
exiting wish me luck
i love you phillip morris green pages
steven lindholm and two clients are at the first tee
steven nervously tees up
he does his best recollection of a warm up and hits the ball
its not a good drive but it does go about thirty yards
this is easy
cocky butch your turn dan
as lindholm and the clients wait a periodic spray of sand flies up from the trap behind them as unseen steven swings in vain
hell of a hazard aint it steven
eventually a ball flies out of the trap
to ball oh yeah
how ya like that sister
steven and the client amble along a few yards behind dan and the other client
steven is covered in sweat and sand
so the black fella says to the jew lawyer bucks a question
aint that expensive
yeah its expensive he says im a jew you nigger
the man laughs to himself
he soon spots his ball up ahead
there i am
i love you phillip morris green pages
he moves on leaving steven standing there disgusted
steven sits at his desk detached and fed up
maybe it was because its just my nature or maybe it was because of my past
or maybe it was because they were the most boring fucking people id ever met in my life
beat whatever the reason i had been robbing them blind for months
flashback to stevens first day on the job as his rheba escorts him to a desk piled high with financial reports
anything else i can do for you
cup of coffee
ill do it today but i dont do that really
steven nods and begins to leaf through various folders
it isnt long before something catches his eye
quick cuts of steven researching by leafing through folders and files intercut with a slow push in on a check printing machine as it spits out product as well as
time lapse footage of employees buzzing through one of the usam hallways
the thing about u samm was that they took in all this hmo money and distributed it to doctors
i love you phillip morris green pages
but in the time between receiving the money and paying it out it was just sitting there not making interest or anything
at his desk steven leafs through the company finances
it occurred to me to set up an investment account where the held money would earn interest for the short time that the company had it
were talking twenty two million at any given time here so even short term the interest adds up pretty quickly
id be making the company millions virtually overnight
he leans back to think to himself
and i of course would take a commission
the only problem with that was i wasnt the one signing the checks
open close on a check being signature stamped with a rubber stamp
a hand places the stamp into a small wooden box and closes it
cut wide to reveal the hand belongs to vera the company accountant and steven is standing over her
it is now we realize we are revisiting an earlier scene
so i ask dont you think thats a little expensive
and the lawyer says yes it is now whats your final question
vera explodes with laughter
its so true
she turns to a colleague
come here you gotta hear this
i love you phillip morris green pages
and as annie comes over stevens hand moves to the wooden box and secretly plucks the rubber stamp
lindholm raps on the open door as he enters
steven we got a problem
vera lost that stupid rubber stamp again
her office is a goddamned disaster and shes the o ring if you know what im saying
how long till we can get a new one
time to overhaul the program
i got a computerized system already on order
no more room for pilot error
steven hangs his head visibly disappointed
should be up and running in a couple months
i want you signing the checks until then
steven brightens up suddenly
you play golf
a huge moving truck is parked before an impressive house in an upscale neighborhood
movers unload and roll dollies past two matching mercedes coupes
steven and phillip oversee the work each holding matching miniature pincers
they smile wide
moments later an offscreen honk gets their attention
i love you phillip morris green pages
they look to see a sporting goods truck pulling up with two jet skis hitched to a trailer
wowed how big was this christmas bonus
covering pretty big
phillip is slightly suspicious
various vignettes of steven and phillips new home
mid story the sheriff is desperate and goes to a psychic
all the woman says is rabbit
rabbit rabbit rabbit thats all
well he thinks bullshit and hes driving back home and what happens
he sees a rabbit crossing the street in front of him
so he pulls over and follows it into the woods and he finds the missing car
all wrecked and turned over and the girls inside
eventually we find steven and phillip in the backyard on a large double chaise lounge
their sleeping min pins are between them
its in the ricky martin people in the bathroom
steven smiles and cuddles up
they can find out all sorts of stuff those people
i love you phillip morris green pages
they can find out anything about anyone
then they could even find out something about you
steven grows suspicious
what is it
its just is something going on
something youre not telling me
because if there is stop now
i dont care about the money the house jet skis all i want is you
i just want us to be together
were always going to be together
and there is nothing going on
then i wouldnt lie to you baby
steven stares back and convinces phillip with a look
birkheim emerges from his parked mercedes c class
after locking it he notices a little smudge and buffs it out with his handkerchief
as he admires his car proudly the building volume of the miami sound machine gets his attention
he sees as steven arrives in his new and much more impressive sl and parks a few spots down
i love you phillip morris green pages
he watches as steven tries on several watches and tosses them back in the glove compartment before settling on one and exiting the car
birkheim raises a brow
birkheim and steven share the elevator
which one is it
that the c youre driving
the door opens
steven exits leaving a disgruntled birkheim in his wake
birkheim pores over spreadsheets taking notes and comparing numbers
close ups on headings like interest earned and deposit indicate hes looking for something he continues to make notes growing ever more suspicious until something catches his eye
in the margin of one of the pages is a doodling of a birkheim doesnt quite know what to make of this
but it seems to stare at him mockingly
i love you phillip morris green pages
steven whistles happily and takes a draw off his coffee mug
as he passes an office something catches his ear
i have some questions about these new accounts weve opened
steven slows to a stop
birkheim his back to the door is on the phone as steven eavesdrops outside
i was wondering if we could compare some numbers
i know you usually talk to our cfo but this is a delicate matter and id like keep it secret for now
steven is worried
open close on blank copies spitting out of a copier
steven stands over the machine his finger on the button as he keeps surveillance on birkheims office door
a secretary arrives with a stack of papers
hi mister ru she leaves terrified
finally steven spots birkheim leaving his office
steven runs into birkheims office and scans the papers on his desk
he turns his attention to birkheims briefcase but he cant get it open
i love you phillip morris green pages
eventually he spots a blank legal pad and looks at it closely
he grabs a pencil and does the old detective trick of shading in the page to reveal what was written on the now missing page above
the embossed text reads
he stares at it a moment
this number looks familiar
he grabs the phone and dials
an automated voice answers
hello youve reached the automatic teller at texas commerce bank
please enter your personal account number followed by the pound sign
steven quickly enters some numbers
as he listens he flips through birkheims desktop calendar
your account balance is eight hundred thirty seven thousand five hundred and two dollars and twelve cents
to repeat this its the same number as on the pad
he hangs up
and turns his attention to the calendar
he spies an entry that reads harris county police he leaps out of the chair and exits the office
steven furiously shreds documents in the companys paper shredder
moments later the same secretary enters the room with an armload of work enraging steven
terrified the woman runs away
open close on an atm keypad as steven punches some keys and retrieves a handful of cash
he stuffs it into his breast pocket and hops back into his sl
the phone rings
i love you phillip morris green pages
steven is on the phone while driving with the top down
how are you
hows steffie doing
she sure is your daughter
shes interested in boys already
he says hi but listen i just wanted to call and let you know im switching all my phone numbers
ill let you know when we get a new one
oh steven are you on the lam again
deb you always knew me best

well maybe this is his plan
now dont start
a call waiting tone is heard
i love you phillip morris green pages
anyway debbie thats my boss calling

steven clicks over to the other line
intercut with lindholm on the phone with birkheim in the background spreadsheets in hand

the gulf freeway
where are you
at the office

is something wrong
no we just want to see you steven
we miss you is what it is
oh thats nice dan
but i dont think im coming back in
i think we both know why
you sure about that steven
bye bye dan
steven hangs up
steven storms into the house panting
a worried phillip comes to greet him
people keep calling whats going on
i love you phillip morris green pages
steven starts pulling wads of money out of every available pocket and piling it on the kitchen table
thought wed take a little vacation
okay ill pack for you
phillip follows him through the house
i fucking knew it you did do something
you lied to me
you looked me right in the eye and lied
now dont get angry its gonna be fun i swear
are you going back to jail
steven you promised wed always be together
of course we are
were never gonna be apart
steven ducks into the bedroom
phillip doesnt follow
you lying son of a bitch
you took advantage of me
just like all the rest
steven furiously packs a suitcase yelling out to phillip in the hallway
well get a place
do some fishing
i can work on my key lime pie recipe
steven picks up the suitcase without zipping it up and heads back into the hall
i might even grow a beard and enter the papa hemingway contest
he stops short in the hallway
phillip is gone
i love you phillip morris green pages
steven bursts from the house still clutching the suitcase just in time to see phillips car rounding the corner
he re enters emptying the suitcase along the way
he then proceeds to fill it with the cash on the table
steven exits and heads for his car but before he can get in wham
hes grabbed by a group of policemen
he squeals like a rabbits death bleat and flails wildly
this continues for a while until steven resumes his voice over in the penitentiary infirmary
there i was keeping secrets living a lie
like i said i tend to do that
now i didnt blame phillip for running out on me but i had to make things right
i had to get him back
you see theres something i didnt tell you
beat its about my old boyfriend
do you remember him
his name was jimmy
i love you phillip morris green pages
the florida sun bathes the bedroom in a heavenly glow illuminating jimmy kemple as he wakes
he opens his eyes to see steven staring longingly at him
steven just smiles
i love you jimmy
its only been a month steven
dont fall for me steven
why the hell not
you know damn well why
steven thinks a moment but never stops smiling
i dont give a shit about that
were back at the scene where steven tries to jump in the dumpster
he leaps over the guard rail and wham
steven hits the ground next to the dumpster
i love you phillip morris green pages
a short time later steven lies moaning and delirious
kemple cradles his head as debbie and the cop watch nearby
you need to do the time
ill wait for you
ill wait for you
i love you
ill wait for you
steven pushes a cart of food through the block delivering sandwiches to fellow detainees
open close on fingers dialing a pay phone
cut wide to reveal its steven making a call
what do you mean
i always call at noon
listens well its prison honey it sucks
but im getting used to it
kemple on the phone at his mothers home is intercut
he looks ill
no really sick
you havent seen me in a year
you dont know
i just came back from the doctor
my t cells are
he begins to cry
why did you have to go to jail
how could you do this to me
i love you phillip morris green pages
i know im sorry
i dont want to die alone
youre not gonna die alone
yes i am
who knows how long i have
youre not gonna die alone okay
just believe me
you dont know that
yes i do
he hangs up tortured by this news
his eyes catch a glimpse of a detective exiting the cell block banging on the guard booth glass with his walkie talkie
he just stares at the door long and hard
steven approaches a section of bars where a blonde inmate is waiting
did you get em
the inmate looks around then shoves a ball of clothes through the bars
steven gives a look
something upsets him
what the hells this
its all i could get
i love you phillip morris green pages
dressed in prison orange steven walks up to a counter a sandwiches in hand
he holds it up before a huge guard
lunch is served
as the guard goes through the bag steven reaches over the counter and swipes a walkie talkie revealing a calendar that reads friday the th
he beats a nervous exit
open close on a mans ass in ruby red skin tight cut to reveal steven walking nervously down the hall clad in said hotpants as well as a tight spaghetti
walkie talkie in hand he tries to give as authoritative an aura as he can
he gets to a glass security door where two jail guards stand
steven taps on the glass confidently with the walkie talkie and signals them to open the door
and as he passes the two guards one of them speaks
shaking head undercover vice
steven approaches another set of doors and signals
the doors open
steven passes through the doors and comes to an exit
he pushes on it to find it locked
panic sets in as he pushes repeatedly to no avail
and just when he thinks all is lost he looks down to realizes hes neglected to notice the push bar to open the door
and with a gentle push the door opens
and hes gone
i love you phillip morris green pages
helen kemple brings a tray of toast and water into the bedroom where steven sits over kemples rapidly deteriorating body
she kisses both jimmy and steven
ill be in the other room
steven tries to give kemple some water
you need to drink something
kemple meekly hands steven his stainless steel rolex
i want you to have this because im gonna be leaving soon
well thats not okay with me baby
you cant leave
i need you around here
youre the love of my life
but no im not
ive seen him
you havent met him yet but you will
steven is perplexed
youre gonna be so happy
and i know you dont think so but you deserve to be happy
youre not thinking clearly baby
i love you phillip morris green pages
yes i am
and you have to promise me
when you find him youre gonna treat him right
steven gives in gently
now drink some water
treat him right
helen is on the couch watching the tv news as oj simpson is apprehended
it isnt long before a knock on the door gets her attention
she gets up
who is it
she reaches for the door and smash
the door bursts open
steven is dragged kicking and screaming to a squad car by a group of policemen
and as he futilely fights a claxon blares and the cell door slides open with metallic roar revealing a very impatient steven with a few days stubble on his face
its about damn time
he rushes out
i love you phillip morris green pages
steven hurries to the phone and dials
he nervously awaits an answer
then hi helen its me
is hes interrupted and proceeds to listen
the look on his face says it all
through the glass wall outside the phone room we watch as steven continues to absorb the bad news
he hangs up the phone and falls to pieces as the cacophony of the prison masks any sound of his grief
open close on the stainless steel rolex
were back outside steven and phillips house in a police cruiser
steven stares at it reflecting on his memory of kemple
im sorry i didnt tell you before
i just dont like talking about some things
the door opens and a houston cop hands him a black this what you wanted
the cop gets in and they drive off
i love you phillip morris green pages
the houston cop and a driving cop ride up front not paying much attention to their passenger
in the rear steven nervously and quietly prepares an insulin syringe and inexpertly injects it in his belly
i wasnt going to lose phillip
i broke jimmys heart and i was not gonna break phillips
i was gonna make everything alright
no matter what it took i was going to escape
he gives a quick look around and prepares another syringe
after another injection he prepares another
and then another and another
the driving cop watches the road blankly until his nose catches a putrid scent in the air
what is that
the other cop smells it too
they begin to look around
the driving cop glances back to see steven convulsing and frothing at the mouth like a rabid bobble head doll
they turn around
he shit himself
get us to the hospital
the siren wails
steven wakes up in a hospital bed
a little bleary at first his eyes scan the room
he sits up pleased and very excited
he pulls out his iv hops out of bed and heads for the window when i love you phillip morris green pages
he stops short to find his ankle is shackled to the bed
the door opens and the houston cop peers his head in
he looks back to his unseen partner
three manacled prisoners one of them steven follow a corrections officer into the processing area at the harris county jail
each of the men are still in their street clothes and manacled separately
take a seat
they take a seat on a bench outside a large steel door as the officer talks to a processing clerk
steven is visibly agitated and ignores the other men on the bench with him
the first prisoner turns to the second prisoner
whatd they get you for
b and e
the second prisoner turns to steven
how about you
but steven is gone
the man looks around
across the room steven stands in an elevator amidst a group of lackadaisical janitors clutching a mop
the prisoner watches in awe as the doors close
i love you phillip morris green pages
the elevator doors open to reveal steven not with the janitors but with a group of officers re emerging from the elevator and back into the processing area
the lead officer talks to the clerk
this slippery son of a bitch is going straight to lockup
steven heaves a sigh
steven in a fresh prison jumpsuit paces while talking on the phone
cmon phillip pick up its me
he hangs up
a nearby inmate chimes in
how long you in for
picks up phone can you hit me in the face with this
and off the inmates quizzened expression open close on stevens bloody face
a prison physician is examining it closely
we notice steven is wearing white scrubs as opposed to the doctor who wears green thats a pretty big gash
just stay still
it sure hurts
i love you phillip morris green pages
as steven talks and the doctor looks steven stealthily plucks the doctors id badge and slips it in his pocket
steven finishes filling the sink in his cell and pulls out a green magic marker
he breaks it open and drips the ink into the water
and as the water turns green steven removes his white scrubs and plunges them in the sink
the night guard watches his monitors when a rap on the glass gets his attention
he looks up to see steven in newly and badly dyed green scrubs awaiting exit on the other side holding the stolen id badge against the glass
he pushes the buzzer and steven pushes open the door
seven state and local police cruisers sit in the parking lot a shirtless steven is removed from his motel room by a pair of officers
his skin is stained green but his expression is pure resolve
open close on a gavel striking
steven stands before the judge flanked by his attorney and a bailiff
set bail at dollars
nine hundred thousand
its a white collar charge
your honor i love you phillip morris green pages
the judge begins filling out a form
he barely looks up at them
mister russell is a flight risk
the bond is set
nine hundred thousand
this is bullshit
sotto to attorney set a reduction hearing
off this your honor wed like to set a reduction hearing
thats your right but i strongly advise you dont
the judge finishes filling out the form and places it at the edge of his bench for steven to see
it clearly reads his bail amount his charge everything
as the attorney prattles on in the background steven just stares at the form long and hard
you can have your hearing tomorrow
sotto to lawyer next week
the attorney looks at him quizzically and turns back to the judge
wed like next week if thats okay
sotto on the thirteenth
oh the thirteenth if possible
friday the thirteenth
now go away
i love you phillip morris green pages
a block of holding cells well stocked with men waiting on the legal system
we soon come upon steven who is furiously sketching out a copy of the form from the judges bench from memory
open close on an opened envelope next to stevens sketch and a letter
long time no talk
i wont beat around the bush
i got into a spot of trouble here in houston and find myself needing help
thats right jail again
anyway i was wondering if you could type up this thing for me on your computer just like i sketched out
as steven reads the letter we reveal a man hacking away on a computer nearby
as we move closer we see that hes the moustached man from the night of his car crash and hes not wearing pants
steven opens a letter and pulls out the forged form
he grabs a pen and begins filling it out
manacled to a line of prisoners steven shuffles through a crowded hallway
courthouse staff are everywhere
steven spots a harried woman approaching with an armful of paperwork
he reaches into his jumpsuit and pulls out the forged document and as she passes he drops it
the woman turns back annoyed
i love you phillip morris green pages
she picks it up and puts it on her pile
he smiles as he watches her walk away
steven dials the phone
intercut a clerk answers her ringing phone
her desk calendar reads september friday the th this is julie
steven puts on his best southern belle voice
as woman hi i have judge charles hearn for the clerks office
ill put him through
steven switches to an authoritative judge voice
gruff this the clerks office
charles hearn i got a bail adjustment coming through sent it over today
whats the name
got it right here
i love you phillip morris green pages
good i need that to go through right away
because if it dont im gonna have to chug about a quart of tidee bowl on account of all the shit ill be eating
know what i mean
you got it judge
and say julie
can you save me a dime and connect me to a good bail bondsman
a limousine pulls up outside a modest galveston house
the chauffeur opens the door and steven emerges dressed in new linen suit and clutching champagne and flowers
he approaches the door and just as hes about to knock go away steven
steven is surprised
you think i didnt know you were coming
phillip get the hell out of here
im done with you
dont say that
they probably have a psychic after you right now
did you see any bunnies
honey i know youre upset but we love each other
i love you phillip morris green pages
you opened a bank account for doctor phillip morris
now they think im in on everything
im facing real time
you know i cant go back to prison
im sorry about that they werent supposed to find that
it was for your own good
so we could be together
im in enough trouble
cmon phillip just trust me fuck you you fucking liar
do you realize how bad youve fucked me over
you made me an accomplice
you fucking liar
i dont want to see you
i never want to see you again
phillip dont say that
well what am i supposed to do
youre the lawyer you figure it out
this time its steven who remains silent
oh my god
the door swings open revealing a seething phillip
youre not even a lawyer
you fucking liar
he slams the door shut again
what the hells going on
who the hell are you
i love you phillip morris green pages
open the door phillip
steven walks up to the door and pleads gently
quietly open the door
just open the door
beat open the door
i just want to say one thing
just one thing
a long silence
steven waits longer than he should with the certainty that it will open
and eventually it does
slowly and tentatively
through the screen door their eyes are just inches apart
steven looks into phillips soul
he opens his mouth and down on the ground faggots
steven and phillip are shocked to see a small swat team surrounding the front porch with automatic weapons
and as they comply and the armed men descend steven and phillip sit manacled side by side
they stare at the floor in miserable uncomfortable silence
i love you
phillip can only sit and stew
until finally hes had enough
i love you phillip morris green pages
from the moment we met youve done nothing but lie
our whole relationship
im such an asshole
you took advantage of me just like all the rest of them
you were supposed to protect me but youve done nothing but make a fool of me
and you expect me to love you
how can i love you
i dont even know who you are
and you know whats sad
i dont even think you know who you are
so how am i supposed to love something that dont even exist
you tell me
eventually a policeman stands before phillip
before he stands up phillip manages a terse statement
i will never forgive you steven
steven is speechless as he watches phillip walk away disappearing down a long corridor
that was the last time i ever saw him
phillip carries his belongings past a line of hulking cat calling convicts
but i knew he was right
phillip jimmy debbie theyve all been right
my whole life was nothing but a bunch of lies
lies to make people love me lies to keep them from leaving me and lies to make them give me their money
he enters his cell
steven carries his belongings to his new cell in michael unit
i love you phillip morris green pages
and in the process i lost track of who i was
maybe barbra bascombe had me pegged right from the beginning and thats why she gave me up
steven stares at his distorted face in the polished metal mirror in his cell
whatever the case how does a person who doesnt exist go on existing
well the answer is he doesnt
steven is curled up in a ball in his cell sobbing as he stares at a snapshot of phillip in key west pasted to the wall
shut the fuck up im trying to sleep
steven sits over an untouched tray of food staring at it detached
he looks thin
steven kneels over the toilet in his cell
the sound of puking reverberates
months later steven sits up in his bed
he now has a grey beard and with his shirt off we can see he has lost an unhealthy amount of weight
i love you phillip morris green pages
open close on the gaunt and grey skinned steven
a male nurse places a thermometer in his mouth and looks at stevens medical history
he looks concerned
ill be right back
steven sits before a young prison doctor who looks through his records
im sorry to have to tell you this steven your t cell counts indicate that uh
you have aids
steven sits expressionless
how long do i have
and off the doctors grave face clouds drift slowly across the sky
the opening scene again the four kids lying on the hill staring at the clouds
young steven smiles at the sight
a dull whine is heard building until the first hospital scene in the movie
the cardio alarm blares
steven watches from his bed as a doctor appears and pushes the nurses aside
wheres the crash cart
he straddles the patients chest and pushes down hard the sound of a sternum cracking can be heard
i love you phillip morris green pages
so here we are where you first met me
a sheet is pulled over the cardio victims corpse and steven watches as it is wheeled out of the ward
he returns his bleary gaze to the ceiling
ive been in this bed for months now
waiting to die
the only thing that keeps me going is the thought that i might get a chance to see phillip one more time
beat but i dont know how much longer i can do this
stevens eyes roll back into his head as he slips into unconsciousness
a slightly built effeminate inmate samuel raps on phillips open cell door as he enters
got a minute
you want some crackers
look i just talked to my friend hes a nurse at the infirmary
i dont know if you know this or not but uh
phillip looks to him with curiosity
phillip flails as guards hold him back from a doctor
let me in
just let me in
i love you phillip morris green pages
hes not here
i need to see him
i told you hes not here
you need to calm down
phillip calms himself
just tell me where he is
he slipped into a coma for a few days
hes conscious now but hes very sick
we had him transferred to a private care facility
there was nothing we could do for him here
its just a matter of time now
phillip listens in devastated silence
steven looks worse than ever in his semi private bed looking out the window at the clouds with a catatonic gaze
hes at peace
it is the moment of his death
death will have to wait another few moments
a nurse leans over him as he tries to focus
someone wants to talk to you
he keeps calling
hes driving us crazy
steven cant respond
the nurse picks up the phone
into phone okay you can put him through
she puts the phone to stevens ear
he can muster only a few words
i love you phillip morris green pages
wisp i didnt want you to find out
phillip is intercut with the helpless steven
why didnt you write me
i dont know how this happened they say im fine
oh god who did this
then it doesnt matter
i had to talk to you steven
tearing up i am still angry with you but i need you to know something
even if sometimes i dont know who you are i love you
i never stopped loving you
smiles you and me are just fools for love i guess written in the stars or some crap like that
tears but it was never better never more real than with you steven
i realize now that all that crazy shit you did in your fucked up way it was always for me
always for us
you are the most amazing man steven
it takes my breath away
and even though i cant be with you now i will always be yours
he steels himself as best he can
now if you have to go go
im right there
im right there
tears surface again
he chokes back a sob
as a single tear runs down stevens face the nurse puts the phone on the hook and leaves
steven lies motionless
he gazes out the window to the passing clouds in the sky
i love you phillip morris green pages
samuel walks past cell after cell with a grave look in his eyes
eventually he arrives at phillips cell to find him sitting on his bunk
phillip looks up
uh my friend in the infirmary
uh they got a call from that long term care place and uh well a few days ago steven then im so sorry phillip
phillip nods as it washes over him
he sends samuel on his way with a look
once hes alone phillip lets go and sobs
he buries his face in his pillow
after a long while clang
a sound gets his attention
a bossy guard stands at the door of his cell
come with me
phillip composes himself and follows the guard out
the guard leads phillip down the corridor
still coming out of his mournful haze he becomes curious
they arrive at a door marked meeting room
where are we going
your lawyers here
he swings open the door to reveal steven alive and well and wearing a thrift store suit
phillip is aghast frozen
i love you phillip morris green pages
did i forget to mention i didnt die
yeah i didnt die
faked the whole thing
steven is curled up in a ball sobbing as he stares at a picture of phillip pasted to the wall
shut the fuck up im trying to sleep
i got a broken heart here
we see now his bunkmate is cleavon
well then do something about it mother fucker stead of crying like whitney houston looking for her crack pipe
steven takes his kind words to heart
yeah i know
love creates miracles motherfucker
aint you ever read the bible
so get off your ass and go forth unto the canaanites you faggot bitch
steven returns his gaze to phillips photo
when youre right youre right cleavon
wanna suck me off
well sweet dreams then
i love you phillip morris green pages
lying there in all my misery i had a moment of clarity
it became clear to me i had to get to phillip
no matter what
even if it meant dying
steven sits over an untouched tray of food staring at it detached
faking your death from aids is no easy task believe me
but after watching jimmy die i thought i could make it convincing
first you have to starve yourself i ate half as much every day for ten months
after that you have to fake all sorts of symptoms
steven kneels over the toilet in his cell sticking his finger down his throat until he pukes
you gotta keep this up for months until you lose about say pounds
months later steven sits up in his bed
he now has a grey beard and with his shirt off we can see he has lost an unhealthy amount of weight
but the hardest part is falsifying your records
steven enters an inmates cell lawrence with a big bag hey lawrence you still work in the infirmary
i love you phillip morris green pages
steven holds up a three pound bag of coffee
you like coffee
lawrence sweeps up in an empty office
he looks to see if the coast is clear and bolts for some file cabinets
after some searching lawrence pulls out a file entitled russell steven a
reading from a scrap of paper he scrawls something with a pen
lawrence then reaches into his pants and pulls out some forged forms stuffing them into the folder
open close on the gaunt and grey skinned steven
a male nurse places a thermometer in his mouth and looks at phillips medical history
close on the file a doctors entry reads hiv since a few flips of the pages reveal forged blood test documents
buzzwords like t cell counts and other terms catch the nurses eye
he looks concerned
ill be right back
steven sits before a young prison doctor who looks through his records
you have aids
steven sits expressionless
how long do i have
and off the doctors grave face i love you phillip morris green pages
steven lays in his hospital bed
a fat nurse puts a pill in his mouth and follows it with some water
once shes clear steven reaches into his mouth and pulls out the pill
he secretly places it into a small hole in his mattress for safe keeping
again we are at the first hospital scene of the movie
the cardio alarm blares
steven watches as a doctor appears and pushes the nurses aside
wheres the crash cart
he straddles the patients chest and pushes down hard the sound of a sternum cracking can be heard
with the staff distracted steven reaches into his mattress hole and pulls out scores of pills
he stuffs them into his mouth as fast as he can
but the hardest part by far is getting transferred to a private care facility
its standard procedure for late stage patients but convincing them i was about to die would involve taking a few risks
he chases the pills down with a glass of water
steven is helped from a corrections van into a wheelchair outside the restful acres facility
after a four day coma they were convinced
in his bed at the care facility steven looks around and picks up the phone
he talks with a foreign accent
this is doctor rios from the hamblin center houston
im looking for aids patients for a study were
i love you phillip morris green pages
and as he talks and once i got settled in i just called the department of corrections and convinced them i was a state sponsored doctor looking for late stage
aids patients for an experimental treatment
then as luck would have it they had one patient that was eligible
steven continues his dr
rios imitation on the phone
oh you do
could you spell that
camera settles on a nearby calendar
it reads monday the calendar reads friday march an orderly enters with a wheelchair
mister russell the clinic sent a taxi here to pick you up
later that day steven is helped out of his wheelchair into a waiting taxi
and for all that time all those doctors all those nurses and all those facilities
not one of them ever thought to give me an aids test
the door slams and off he drives
once clear steven speaks to the driver
i love you phillip morris green pages
i had a special request when i ordered the cab
did they tell you
yeah right here
he lifts a greasy brown bag into view
steven grabs it and begins to gorge himself on burgers
a week later the hospice was to get a call from doctor rios telling them steven russell had died undergoing treatment
and after all that hard work dying
wheres the first place i go
back to meeting room
phillip stands frozen before steven funny huh
the guard pushes phillip past the threshold
the door slams shut behind him
he staggers toward steven as a kaleidoscope of emotions plays across his face
bewilderment relief sorrow joy and finally anger whack
he slaps steven across the face
youre such a fucker
i know im sorry you werent supposed to find out
well i did
i couldnt take a chance telling you
you know that
but phillip i only did it so i could get here to you
then just to talk to you
and here i am
i love you phillip morris green pages
phillip tries to take this to heart
after a moment
youre so skinny
steven i dont wait
i just came here to tell you one thing and thats it
you dont have to take me back i just want to say one thing
phillip is listening
i know you thought we were nothing but a lie but underneath all those lies there was always something that was real
i thought about what you said to me
you said you dont know who i am
but i have to tell you i know now
i know who i am
i mean im not a lawyer im not a cfo im not a cop
hell im not even an escape artist
those steven russells are dead
and now all thats left is the man that loves you
im just the man that loves you
then and if you can see that
then i promise ill never be anything else ever again
a long long silence
phillip looks to him
how do i know youre not bullshitting me again
he looks phillip square in the eye
and as phillip stares at him i love you phillip morris green pages
a long silence
at a window a clerk stamps a few documents and hands them to steven who is dressed in his lawyer attire
steven exits the line and ducks into a nearby bathroom
at the urinal steven whistles to himself
super steven russell was arrested two weeks later trying to secure phillips release
steven turns his head to find the man at the next urinal staring at him
its a very surprised birkheim with a badge affixed to his jacket reading juror
steven smiles at him
steven sits in court while a female d
argues her case
super an embarrassment to the state of texas and governor george bush steven was given an unprecedented life sentence
she nods to the audience where lindholm sits smiling
super coincidentally the d
who prosecuted him was the sister in law of dan lindholm stevens former boss steven smiles wide shackled in a solitary by cell
super steven sits in hour a day lockdown with only one hour a day for supervised showers and exercise
steven stares at his key west calendar with a small photo of phillip attached to it
the cell brightens everything around steven blooms with white light
he looks to see
i love you phillip morris green pages
phillip also enveloped in white light sits on the bow of staring at him with a smile
steven smiles back
super on average there are
friday the ths a year
a siren blares over a wide of the facility
small in frame we see steven running from the prison gaining ground on the two guards chasing him
