b if window
href b b one flew over the cuckoos nest all we see is an elevated shot of the distant mountains rolling landscape and mcmurphy one cheek laid open and crusted
over with dried blood his face and prison work clothes caked with dried sweat and dust as he sits on the very top of a water tower watching the last rays of sunlight
a long moment passes before mcmurphys attention is drawn elsewhere and he looks down
reverse shot mcmurphys pov far below in the prison yard a man is seen hurrying acrcss the yard where he joins a group of men composed of armed prison guards
officials and medics a stretcher an ambulance a fire truck and safety nets spread out at the base of the water tower
the man is seen talking to the officials then a bullhorn is handed to him and they all look up at mcmurphy
mcmurphy as he looks down at them a searchlight is turned on him
through bullhorn mcmurphy
this is doctor shankle from the infirmary
can you hear me
mcmurphy doesnt respond
through bullhorn can you hear me mcmurphy
mcmurphy doesnt respond
another searchlight goes on as a second voice is picked up on the bullhorn
through bullhorn why dont we blast im for christ sake he aint gonna come down
the bullhorn is turned off
a long moment passes as mcmurphy continues to squat on the tower and wait
he shivers against the coming night when
through bullhorn mcmurphy
i have the wardens promise
if you come down nobody will hurt you
youll be in my custody
an imperceptible smile appears on mcmurphys face
strange humming sounds clanking pipes and hissing radiators as we see beds with patients lying asleep line two walls
the third wall is a heavy gauge steel grill with a door that opens on to the day room
the door is open
on the far side of the day room a long hallway with other doors opening into rooms the latrine washroom tub room mess hall seclusion room psychiatrists office visitors room
across the day room a glass enclosed nurses station where turkle a negro night attendant is seen preparing to go off duty
the camera pans the beds in the mens dorm
one man turns another twists a third lies as if dead
camera pan ends on bromden who lies still eyes wide open very alert
he reaches down plucks a stale piece of gum from under the bed frame puts it in his mouth and starts chewing
a beat then bromden carefully undoes the leather strap which binds him to the bed
he slips out of bed and quietly makes his way down the aisle paying no attention to the other patients some of who are beginning to stir awake
ahead at the end of the hallway the door opens and three negro day attendants washington warren and miller dressed in white uniforms enter and move down the hallway and
disappear into a side room
bromden continues his silent journey towards the day room as turkle emerges from the side door to the nurses lounge goes up the hallway as miss pilbow the day nurse
comes in passing turkle on the way out
she crosses to the nurses station and enters as bromden reaches the day room
as bromden makes his way across the day room past the nurses station unnoticed by miss pilbow who is busy preparing the days medication
bromden is sliding along the hallway wall when he is suddenly cut off by a mop which thuds against one side of his neck
a second mop yokes him on the other side
where you goin chief
you goin tsee the big white fathuh
he goin tsee the big white muthuh
they cackle legs jiving as the ammonia stings bromdens eyes and burns his nose
he tries to twist his head but washington jams the mop harder
bromden freezes panic spreading across his face
haw look at im big nough to eat apples off my head an he mine me like a baby
a key is heard hitting the lock in the main door
washington very adroitly releases bromden hands him the mop and turns along with warren and miller to their duties as big nurse enters the ward
simultaneously as big nurse passes mornin miss ratched
good morning boys
she sweeps by and disappears into the nurses station
the three attendants put their mops and rags aside and start towards the mens dorm leaving bromden pressed against the wall mop in hand
as big nurse enters to be greeted by miss pilbow who wears an enormous cross between her breasts
good morning miss ratched
its a beautiful day isnt it
mean old monday miss pilbow mean old monday
she flips on the intercom good morning boys
rise and shine
rise and shine
as washington warren and miller roust the patients out of bed
through loudspeaker time to get up
come on now its a beautiful day
lets not straggle
everybody up up up
the chronics are physically helped out of bed as the acutes who can handle themselves cross out into the day room rubbing the sleep out of their eyes
big nurse steps out of the nurses station
washington and warren are hustling the patients toward the washroom
miller stays behind stripping blastics bed and rolling up his mattress
as the acutes straggle past big nurse
good morning mister sefelt
good morning mister fredrickson
good morning billy i spoke to your mother last night and she sends her love
good morning mister harding
good morning mister cheswick
bromden comes drifting by going in the opposite direction
big nurse takes his hand and reaches up and pats his face
oh mister bromden
calling out mister washington
washington comes running
yes miss ratched
mister washington why dont we get a good head start on the day by shaving mister bromden and see if we cant avoid a disturbance
taking bromden by the hand yes miss ratched
the patients are busy washing and shaving
warren is assisting a vegetable wash himself as washington guides bromden through a cage like partition
where an antique barber chair stands
calling as he goes warren
he sits bromden down and straps his bands and legs in then plugs the electric shaver in and turns it on and brings the buzzing instrument towards bromdens face
bromden turns away
shouting out get your black ass in here
warren props the vegetable up against the sink
be right back
warren leaves the old man starts sliding
as warren enters and takes a firm grip on bromdens head and washington goes to work on bromdens face
camera pushes into extreme closeup of bromdens fearfully distorted face as the buzzing sound of the electric razor intensifies until it is no sound as we see big nurse watch
the last few patients file past the side door to the nurses station where miss pilbow hands out little cups with pills
washington stands by checking to see each man takes his pills before filling their cups with orange juice
the last patient takes his pills and returns to his place in the day room
miss pilbow closes the window
satisfied that all is well big nurse turns on an old record player with a stack of records then she settles down to her work as a soft nostalgic number
from the s is heard over loudspeaker
camera begins slow pan of the day room
the patients under the influence of drugs have settled down for the day
harding is playing cards with martini cheswick and billy
sefelt and fredrickson are putting a jigsaw puzzle together in brotherly love
sorensen is off by himself rubbing his hands clean
taber pencil in hand sits pondering over a blank piece of paper
scanlon paces back and forth
on the chronics side of the room ruckly is turning a grimy photograph over in his hands
bancini sits wagging his head mumbling over and over tired awful tired
ellis stands against the wall arms outstretched hands nailed to the wall by imaginary nails
bromden is pushing a mop around
washington warren and miller are in the mens dorm making up the chronics beds when o
the telephone rings
as miss pilbow picks up the phone
eighty two miss pilbow speaking
she makes a note and hangs it new admission miss ratched
miss pilbow goes to the mirror quickly preens herself then turns and flips the intercom on
over loudspeaker mister washington
as miss pilbow exits nurses station and heads down the hallway washington and warren on her heels
miller looking wistfully after them
staff personnel are seen moving in and out of the main entrance where a state penitentiary car is parked
a deputy sheriff leans on the fender smoking a cigarette as second deputy sheriff comes out of the building and motions down to first deputy who crushes his cigarette out
then opens the rear door to the car
to an unseen occupant okay lets go
a long beat then mcmurphy slowly emerges from the car
hes wearing handcuffs and dressed in faded jeans flannel work shirt leather jacket black motorcycle cap and heavy black boots
hes been scrubbed clean and has a band aid on his cheek
mcmurphy does a couple of knee bends to get the kinks out of his legs as deputy reaches in the car and takes out a small gym bag containing mcmurphys
lets move it
mcmurphy goes up the stairs followed by the deputy and crosses into the building
as mcmurphy enters the building followed by the deputies where nurse pilbow mcmurphys folder in hand and washington and warren stand waiting all in a pleasant receptive mood
first deputy hands mcmurphys gym bag to washington who hands it to warren
okay this is it
mcmurphy turns and holds out his hands
as cuffs are removed mcmurphy impulsively takes hold of the deputys head and plants a kiss on his forehead
squirming out of mcmurphys grasp jesus youre crazy mcmurphy
yeah aint that the truth
to miss pilbow hes all yours miss
thank you officer
the two deputies start down the stairs
so long fellas
the two deputies merely shrug their backs at mcmurphy who takes a deep breath of fresh air
yes sir its a mighty nice fall day
this way mister mcmurphy
mcmurphy follows nurse pilbow into the hallway as the door closes behind them
other staff members are administrative personnel are seen as mcmurphy walks alongside nurse pilbow who is noticeably nervous by his close proximity
washington and warren casually bringing up the rear
as he peels the band aid off revealing a scar i tell ya these goons showered me at the courthouse this morning last night at the jail and i swear
theyd have swabbed my ears out on the way over if they couldve found the facilities
a young japanese nurse named itsu passes by
to nurse itsu hey how ya doin cutie

nurse itsu laughs and disappears around the corner
to nurse pilbow yes sir i sure am gonna enjoy my stay here

to nurse pilbow ya know i aint never been in an institution of psychology before
they arrive at the ward door
nurse pilbow unlocks the door and opens it as
yeah im here on a ninety day observation period
short timer like they say
soft nostalgic music is heard over
indicating door mister mcmurphy
after you maam
nurse pilbow enters the ward and mcmurphy watches her cross the visitors area to a heavy gauge steel screen wall with security gate which she opens
to washington and warren as they step into ward man there sure is an awful lot of poontang around here
calling hold it
mcmurphy turns to see doctor spivey approaching
good morning boys
simultaneously as spivey passes into the ward mornin doctor spivey

simultaneously yes sir
the door closes
camera holds on sign that reads yeah i was just thinking the same thing doc
as mcmurphy spivey washington and warren cross the visitors area towards nurse pilbow who stands holding the security gate open
at the far end of the hallway which opens into the day room patients can be seen

oh do you do much fishing

washington and warren continue down the hallway passing sefelt who shyly approaches and waits at a respectful distance

mcmurphy and nurse pilbow reach the day room
make yourself at home mister mcmurphy
thank you maam nurse pilbow enters the nurses station closing the door behind her
next to the door is a bulletin board which among other bits of information reads another notice reads washington warren miller there are no other names listed
sefelt passes by
sefelt crosses into the day room where he joins fredrickson who is putting a jigsaw puzzle together
as mcmurphy drifts into the room and looks around
the room is as it was
the music ends
there is a click
mcmurphys attention is drawn to the nurses station
mcmurphys pov of nurses station where miss pilbow is seen through a large plate glass window busy typing a nameplate for mcmurphy
big nurse her back to mcmurphy is turning over a stack of records
she presses the phonograph button
a record falls on the turntable and music begins as she turns and sees mcmurphy
mcmurphy smiles and tips his hat to big nurse
big nurse smiles back and takes her seat
mcmurphy turns and drifts into the day room
big nurse looks up and studies him
mcmurphy catches the eye of a patient sitting by himself

taber pencil and paper in hand crosses to mcmurphy and taps him on the shoulder

harding gets up and crosses to the hallway gathering his pride as he goes
mcmurphy slides into hardings seat and rakes all the cards in
yessir thats why i came to this establishment for to bring you birds fun and entertainment round the gamin table
mcmurphy fans the deck out and lays it on the table
everyones eyes pop as he scoops the cards up in one movement hes a card shark a magician leaving the acutes with their mouths hanging open
easy now dont smudge em we got lots of games ahead of us
mcmurphy turns to see big nurse approaching washington casually bringing up the rear
handing him his bag will you come with me please

mcmurphy walks with her toward the mens dorm
my name is miss ratched
im the head nurse here
youve already met miss pilbow and aides washington and warren
big nurse and mcmurphy stop at the security gate to the mens dorm where miller opens the gate
mister miller this is mister mcmurphy wholl be staying with us
greetings are exchanged as they pass through
as big nurse and mcmurphy cross down the aisle
we do appreciate the way you have taken it upon yourself to meet the other patients
thank you maam
big nurse stops at an empty bed where warren is turning the mattress down
this is your bed
you may leave your things in that cabinet
please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know dont hesitate to ask us

mcmurphy doesnt move

they smile sizing up each other
yeah you aint half so bad looking for a head nurse
now go along mister mcmurphy
to washington lead the way sam
they cross out of the mens dorm
big nurse watches them go
what other work have you done
doctor spivey is seated behind his desk on which are several glass framed photos of spiveys family plus a nameplate john m
and mcmurphys papers
mcmurphy freshly showered and wearing hospital issue clothes sits facing him
hell doc ive been everything from a hoopla man with a two bit carny show to a top mechanic and bull goose catskinner for every gypo loggin operation in the
northwest till the army taught me what my natural bent was
oh what was that
yeah but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man
in what way
they say im a habitual hassler
like i fight some
they didnt mind so much when i was a dumb logger and got into a hassle
thats a hardworkin feller blowing off steam they say
but if youre a gambler all you have to do is spit slantwise and youre a goddamned criminal
to tell the truth ever since i found my natural callin i done time in so many small time jails i could write a brochure
ah do you know why youre here
well ya know doc
indicating his papers doesnt it say so there
looking over papers well according to the warden at pendleton you were a disturbing influence on others
it appears that there is a potential in him for instigating a revolt among the other inmates
looking up at mcmurphy what do you think of that report
i dont doc
goes back to papers arrested on an assault charge five times
thats correct doc
reading from folder the doctor at the prison states dont overlook the possibility that this man may be faking psychosis to escape the drudgery of the work farm
what do you say to that
doc what can i tell ya
ah it seems you have no other psychiatric history mister murphy
no this is my first trip doc
closes folder and sits back well youre here for a ninety day observation period mister mcmurphy
id like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state
so id like your cooperation
you bet doc
camera is on big nurse as she stands in front of a chair doing a deep breathing exercise
the patients and staff standing in front of chairs arranged in a circle follow suit as best they can
after a couple of exercises big nurse sits
the others do the same except bancini who remains standing wagging his head back and forth
oh im awful tired
busy with her papers somebody please see to mister bancini so we can start the meeting
gently laying a hand on bancini
t t t take it e e easy p p p pete
billy gently eases bancini into his chair and sits beside him patting his skinny knee
at the close of fridays meeting we were discussing mister hardings problem concerning his wife
reading from logbook mister harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street
is that correct mister harding
yes thats perfectly correct
reading he also thinks he may have given her reason to seek sexual attention elsewhere but he didnt say how
he has been heard to say to his wife i hate you i dont ever want to see you again
youve betrayed me
she closes book so
does anyone care to touch upon this further
big nurse waits
a long beat
harding sits chewing his nails tensely waiting almost wanting someone to begin
the patients shift uncomfortably looking in all directions
mcmurphy looks around to see what will follow when he sees ellis nailed to the wall his pants leg darkens and a puddle of piss forms at his feet
mcmurphy looks to see if big nurse or the aides have noticed
if they have no one pays any attention
mcmurphy fidgets in his seat then gets up crosses to ellis unhooks him from the wall and moves him over a few feet
the other patients are aghast at this move look at each other quizzically
big nurse merely watches
mcmurphy crosses back to his chair and sits
mister mcmurphy this ward is a democratic community run by the patients and their votes so you should feel at ease in your new surroundings to the extent you can
freely discuss emotional problems in front of the patients and staff
however the cardinal rule and i must emphasize this everyone keeps their seat during the meeting
yeah well it just pains me somethin awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water
we were discussing mister hardings problem with his wife
now who will start
no response billy
m m m maam
would you like to start
n n n n n no maam
sefelt shrugs and sinks into his seat
scanlon looks at the floor
cheswick wags his head no
am i to take it that there isnt a man among you who has an opinion concerning this matter
no response she focuses in on harding mister harding youve stated on more than one occasion that you suspected your wife of seeing other men
yes miss ratched this is correct
but you have no proof
no miss ratched
and yet you suspect her
yes that is correct
i can only speculate as to the reasons why
have you ever speculated mister harding that you are impatient with your wife because she does not meet your mental requirements
one of the chronics laughs like a child
given all the conditions of that sublime relationship coupled with the subsequent annihilation of all that i held to be sacred mentally physically and emotionally the only thing that i
can speculate on at this late date is how i will justify the very existence of my life with or without my dear wife
whats he talkin about
yeah harding why dont you knockoff the bullshit and get to the point
several acutes chime in yeah get to the point ad lib
the point is i will carry on until i fully understand what the function of that relationship is regardless of form or content
several hands go up
i i i i i d d dont s s see how anyone could lu lu lu love a man who t t t talks the way he does
yeah harding youre so fuckin dumb i cant believe it
thats a matter of opinion
yeah harding where do you breathe anyway
through the ass
sefelt and fredrickson snicker into their hands
a few of the others laugh
smarting is that your sense of humor or are you trying to say something
innocence itself now what would i be trying to say
i dont know
i dont know but it makes me feel very peculiar when you throw in something like that
yeah tell us why
i hesitate to go on
no secrets mister harding
lets get it all out in the open
i mean the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having
i know that to be the case but the way in which you broached it if thats your idea of teaching me something
his voice rising as he goes on or making me aware of a condition in my life then i say categorically speaking the hell with you taber
i dont have to justify the condition of my life to you or any of you
no matter what i will carry on until i fully understand what that function is regardless of the form or content
regardless of the fact we must try to understand the function of our capacity to obtain to personify the condition the condition of our existence our existence
you know what harding
i think youre some kind of morbid asshole or something
youve been talking about your wife evere since i can remember
you know shes on your mind and blah blah blah and on and on and when are you going to wise up and turn her loose
yeah wise up harding
yeah turn her loose
start pouring it on yeah who do you think you are anyway
he thinks hes god almighty
hes a snob
hes a schmuck
get rid of him
ship him upstairs
chiming in ffffffuck da wife
wagging his head tired
not letting up zap him
give im lobotomy
cut his nuts off
he doesnt have any
in a strong angry voice im tired
somebody see to mister bancini
two or three acutes get up and try to soothe bancini but he isnt to be hushed
oh god im tired
big nurse nods to washington who goes to pete and gives his arm a jerk toward the door
bancini is unmovable
big nurse signals nurse pilbow who heads for the nurses station
washington senses danger lets go of petes arm backs away
you a good boy mistah bancini
nurse pilbow returns hypodermic needle in hand
pete turns to his fellow inmates
its a lotta baloney
its all a lotta baloney
yes yes mister bancini now if youll just be calm
thats all it is just a lotta baloney
ya see i cant help it cant
working her way around bancini yes i know i know
she gets him in the ass with the needle and springs back
dont ya see
i was born dead
you wasnt born dead
ahhh its been so hard
starts going over slowly sighing and crying tired
aw ful tired
mcmurphy looks around at the others
each patient is locked in his own world oblivious to bancinis state
wide shot of entire court surrounded by a high fence topped off with barbed wire as washington and warren escort the acutes including bromden ellis a lobotomy case and several
other chronics through the gate onto the court which is run down with cracks in its surface and leaves scattered everywhere
martini who is carrying the ball runs ahead followed by scanlon where he starts dribbling the ball in a frantic circle suddenly passes the ball to nothing
as he throws ball catch it
the ball rolls to the corner
martini there aint nobody there ya dumb goon
go get the ball
martini turns away his feelings hurt
washington goes after the ball when martini goes running after it
i get it
i get it
but washington gives martini a body check and beats him to the ball
martini tries to get the ball from washington who is quite agile and teases him as he returns to the court where he and warren start shooting baskets freezing martini
and scanlon out
the other patients just hang around or walk as if in a prison yard
cheswick stands in close proximity to mcmurphy and harding who stand watching the action
mcmurphy finally offers a cigarette to harding who accepts
they both light up
well say buddy is that the usual pro cedure for those group therpy shindigs
bunch of chickens at a peckin party
a pecking party
thats right buddy
and you want to know who pecks the first peck
ah come off it
its that big nurse thats who
the other acutes have gathered around mcmurphy and harding
its as simple as that
youve been on our ward six hours and have already simplified the work of freud jung and maxwell jones in one grand analogy its a pecking party

its the questions she asks

miss ratched is a competent psychiatric nurse not some some kind of monster pecking out our eyes
as calm as blue waters she aint peckin at your eyes buddy
mcmurphy grabs harding by his balls and harding goes up on his toes
shes peckin at your balls buddy at your ever lovin balls
harding is doubled over
that kind of behavior will get you a p
rating my friend
what the hell is that
which gets you shipped up to disturbed for a nice little zap job
electro shock therapy my friend
five cents worth of electricity and you are out of everybodys hair
tell er to go to hell anyway
and if you persist in your ways they can always ship you over to medical surgery
pointing to lobotomy case that
a vegetable complete with two half dollar scars in his forehead
mcmurphy as he absorbs this bit of information the basketball rolls to his feet and he picks it up
to harding is that your sense of humor or are you tryin to say somethin
now what would i be trying to say
martini and scanlon rush over and try to get the ball
gimme the ball
pass the ball mcmurphy
mcmurphy crosses to the court bouncing the ball as he goes
when he reaches the court he holds the ball out to washington who reaches for it but mcmurphy snaps it back over his shoulder to martini
turning to martini pass it to me martini
martini holds back
cmon ill give it back
martini passes to mcmurphy

mcmurphy steps out of the station closing the door behind him
as mcmurphy goes around to the front of the nurses station and queues up behind the other acutes who are getting their medication
mcmurphy reaches the window takes the cup but doesnt take his pills

mcmurphy breathes on the glass and wipes it clean with his sleeve
sorry to have bothered you

mcmurphy turns to walk away

mcmurphy makes a big show of popping the pill in his mouth holding his paper cup upside down for all to see then moving on to washington who fills it
with orange juice
mcmurphy gulps it down not without some difficulty then he smiles at all the concerned faces and crosses the room to the card table where he sits to see the
acutes looking at him
why didnt you tell her to go to hell lover boy

mcmurphy holds the pill up and flicks it into hardings forehead

and youre just the man for the job right
hell i couldnt get it up over old hatchet face if ya paid me
shes not all that homely mister mcmurphy
in fact she must have been a rather beautiful young lady
the men look at big nurse
the patients look at the nurses station
big nurse is busy at her work
the patients looking at her
they turn back to their card game
camera holds on big nurse as mcmurphys voice is heard over through intercom yeah an im tellin ya shes just an icy hearted over the hump gal who never got
enough of the old wham bam to straighten er out
okay who wants a card
through intercom me
big nurse looks up and studies the men gathered round the table
the patients are asleep except for bromden who stands by the window looking out
mcmurphy is asleep in the bed next to his
a beat when turkle a fifty year old negro night attendant slightly drunk lays a gentle hand on bromdens shoulder
les get back to bed mistah bromden
bromden allows himself to be led back to bed
turkle fumbles around for the security belt finds it straps bromden loosely in bed then goes off clucking to himself
bromden reaches under his bed and plucks a stale piece of gum from under the bed frame
he starts chewing it when he sees mcmurphy looking at him
bromden goes right on chewing and looking mcmurphy right in the eye
i wanna ask ya somethin
sings oh does the spearmint lose its flavor on the bedpost overnight
when you chew it in the morning will it be too hard to bite
this questions got me goin wont somebody set me right does the spearmint lose its flavor on the bedpost overnight
mcmurphy holds the last note reaches over and rustles through his nightstand
here ya go chief
a small object lands on bromdens bed
it is a fresh package of gum
bromden picks it up
deposits his old piece of gum under the bed frame then inserts the fresh gum in his mouth and starts chewing
showing the mens dorm the empty day room turkle asleep in the nurses station empty hallways the night superintendent aberrated shot of institutional grounds seen through steel mesh screen as
the sun rises above the treetops
looking out of the window
his face washed by the sunlight
his eyes have a vague look almost vacuous as
through loudspeaker good morning boys
rise and shine
rise and shine
as washington warren and miller roust the patients out of bed
through loudspeaker time to got up
come on now its a beautiful day
lets not straggle
everybody up up up
mcmurphy is in bed not ready for the world when washington crosses to bromden who is looking out the window and leads him off
les go chief
les go get ourselves all nice and clean
to mcmurphy you too mistah mack murphy
washington goes off with bromden
camera holds on mcmurphy as he slowly pulls it together and sits on the edge of the bed
hes naked as he opens the drawer to his nightstand and fishes around for a cigarette
looking in the drawer what the
looking around who the fuck stole my cigarettes
as the acutes straggle past big nurse
good morning mister sefelt are your teeth any better
good morning mister fredrickson
good morning mister harding my my youve been biting your fingernails again
she sees mcmurphy approaching wearing a towel around his waist and a scowl on his face
mister mcmurphy patients are not permitted to run around in towels
i wanna report a robbery
on this ward
yeah some creep stole my cigarettes
oh i had them removed
patients are rationed to one pack of cigarettes a day
bromden comes drifting by going in the opposite direction
big nurse takes his hand
calling out mister washington
washington comes running
yes miss ratched
please see to mister bromden
taking bromden by the hand yes miss ratched
washington leads bromden off
big nurse turns to cheswick and several other acutes who have crowded around
now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast
to mcmurphy you too mister mcmurphy
how bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose
after breakfast mister mcmurphy after breakfast
you sure run a tight assed ship round here dont ya
now run along like a good boy and see that you wash up properly
a beat as the acutes wait for mcmurphys next move then kay lets go brush our teeth fellas
mcmurphy turns and crosses toward the washroom singing at the top of his lungs
oh lulu had a baby his name was sunny jim she put im in a piss pot to teach im how to swim
oh he swam to the bottom he swam to the top lulu got excited an pulled im by his
cock tail ginger ale five cents a glass an if ya dont like it ya can shove it up your
ask me no more questions ill tell ya no more lies
watching mcmurphy who removes his towel as he enters the washroom
as mcmurphy enters to see warren take a firm grip on bromaens head and washington goes to work on bromdens face
camera pushes into extreme closeup of bromdens fearfully distorted face as the buzzing sound of the electric razor intensifies until it is insupportable
we see the attendants spooning food into the sucking pink mouths of the vegetables a shade too fast for swallowing
whats wrong with you guys
we see mcmurphy seated with the acutes shoveling food down his guillet
the others are barely touching their food
why if id have known how soft this place was gonna be id have arranged for my transfer sooner
holding up his orange juice look at this here real orange juice
slugging it down hooee thats good
why you couldnt pay me to leave this place
slaps his belly all this place lacks is a couple of sweet gals to liven things up
he gets up and carries his tray to the proper place where he notices miller loading several other trays onto a dumbwaiter
miller pushes a button and the dumbwaiter goes down
mcmurphy crosses to the door to find it blocked by washington
stand aside sam natures callin
nobody leaves here till seven thirty
mcmurphy turns washington over in his mind then he looks up at the clock above the door
the time is
the second hand sweeping its way toward
dont know if i can hold it that long sam
thas your problem
confidentially who do you like in the opening game sam
turning away asshole
mcmurphy turns and walks away
washington watches him go
i wanna know about my cigarettes
a group meeting is in progress
doctor spivey is there
cheswick is on his feet
sit down mister cheswick
not sitting no i aint no kid to have my cigarettes keep from me like cookies
aint that right mack
mcmurphy doesnt respond mack
sit down mister cheswick
cheswick sits stunned
a beat then to cheswick you should have thought about that before you gambled all your cigarettes away
is that clear
cheswick sulks in his seat
mister cheswick is that clear
opens her book now as i recall we were making quite a bit of headway last time with mister hardings problem
so does anyone care to begin
mcmurphys hand goes up
no one elses does
yes mister mcmurphy
ive been givin some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours an i got a few things i wanna get
off my chest before we get back to hardings problem
certainly mister mcmurphy
mcmurphy takes a folded sheet of paper out of his pocket unfolds it studies it and begins
ive been thinkin bout the age problem we got on this ward
you know the young an old livin together an i was thinkin what a great thing it would be if the music was turned up louder
louder so the old fellas could hear better
doctor spivey nods with approval
big nurse doesnt
the acutes are bewildered
but then i got to thinkin the music is so loud already it makes it difficult for the young fellas to hold a decent conversation
nods and murmurs of approval from the acutes
big nurse can only wait for mcmurphys next move
well i was turnin this dilemma over in my head when i happened to hit on that old tub room out there an i said to myself mcmurphy i said
that place would make a great second day room
a sort of game room for the young fellas
whadaya think doc
it is worth considering
the point is well taken doctor but do we have the necessary personnel to cover a second day room
well since it will be largely the chronics who remain here one aide and one nurse should easily be able to handle any situation that might occur
he turns to the patients what do you think men is it workable
several other acutes voice in the affirmative
yes yes i think we should give it a trial period
may we get back to mister hardings problem
she sees mcmurphys hand up yes mister mcmurphy
im not finished yet
looking at his list kay item two
tomorrow and listen carefully to me you ding a lings
tomorrow is the opening game of the world series an what i want is to take a vote on switchin the group meetin to later on in the day so
we can watch the ballgame
just a minute mister mcmurphy
please understand the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines
the hell with the schedule you can get back to the schedule next week when the series is over
what i want is a vote on it right now
i second the motion
atta boy cheswick
all those in favor please raise your hands
big nurse casts a watchful eye over the patients
raising his hand okay raise your hands
only cheswicks goes up
come on what is this crap
who wants to watch the world series
martini and scanlons hands go up
several acutes look at them
scanlon and martinis hands go down
mcmurphy cant believe his eyes
politely i count only two including you mister mcmurphy
certainly not enough to change ward policy
mcmurphys hand goes down
now was there anything else you wanted to discuss mister mcmurphy
mcmurphy starts tearing his sheet of paper up into a thousand pieces
checking her watch then i suggest we turn our attention back to mister hardings problem
would anybody care to begin
she looks around
mcmurphy is slouched in his chair
harding puts his hands up
no one else does
yes mister harding
yes thank you miss ratched
since our last meeting i have been reflecting quite seriously on the nature of my problem
naturally im referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain
to personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function
he stops chews his lip then continues regardless of the function we will confront the question of
the question of
yes confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis
yes the crisis of our souls
of our souls which i am trying to fully understand the problem
not to shut ourselves off but somehow
somehow to understand fully our capacity
depends on the question
harding breaks off sweating he begins to knead his forehead and chew his nails
silence as the camera reflects the room the patients the staff the hallways the hospital the grounds the trees the sky ending on
hold it a minute
whats a man need to buy thum hotels
bromden is pressed against the wall watching mcmurphy martini scanlon and cheswick play a game of monopoly
the others are playing cards or just hanging around a little chagrined
billy is most disturbed by this separation
you need four houses on every lot of the same color martini
now lets go for christsakes

theres a flurry of money from martini red green and yellow bills blowing in every direction
lets go for christsakes

cheswick rolls the dice

cheswick starts counting out the money

martini is crestfallen

mcmurphy sits and resumes his game of solitaire
martini and scanlon are putting the monopoly game back together again
bromden spots or he thinks he spots one of the attendants listening at the door
he wants to warn the others but doesnt know how
maybe hell just show miss ratched his big thing an shell open the door for him
sefelt and frederickson smile at each other
bromden slides along the wall toward the door
maybe ill just use that thick skull of yours as a batterin ram sefelt
why my head would just squash like an eggplant mcmurphy
fredrickson and sefelt snicker in their hands
you think its funny huh
yeah you dont know how to get outta this place
bromden reaches the door and looks out
no one is there
put your money where your mouth is taber
yeah yeah youre a fucking phony mcmurphy
bromden turns back to the room to see mcmurphy slam his fist down on the table the monopoly game goes flying
rising and turning on the others who back off you want me to show ya
you want me to show ya how
yeah yeah show me
show me how
he looks wildly around the room spots the machine crosses to it and smacks it with his hand
with this thing

the acutes stand aside and mcmurphy steps up to the machine
he shifts his feet to get a good stance wipes his hands on his thighs leans down and gets hold of the levers on each side and strains
bromden watches in awe of mcmurphy
mcmurphy turns loose straightens up and shifts his feet for a better position
just warmin up
he grabs the levers again
his whole body shakes with the strain
for just a second we hear the cement grind
then his breath explodes and he falls back limp against the wall
theres blood on his hands
no sound but his rasping breath
he opens his eyes and looks around
then pulls out a pocketful of ious and tries to sort them out but his hands are frozen into red claws
he throws the whole bundle on the floor and walks out
at the door he turns back
but i tried
goddammit i sure as hell did that much
looking at the machine
a long beat
the patients are getting ready for bed when billy approaches mcmurpby who is in bed

mcmurphy turns away from billy who crosses to the other side of the bed

k k kay mack
washington warren and miller are at the end of the hallway listening to a small radio
we can hear the sports announcer giving the line up for the opening game of the world series
way down the hall the group meeting is seen in progress
a group meeting is in progress and big nurse is honed in on billy
try billy try
billy tries but cant talk
the other acutes are bored restive waiting
mcmurphy has ants in his pants as big nurse speaks to billy

no response from billy
that was the first time you attempted to commit suicide wasnt it

jesus christ the man doesnt want to talk so get off his back an lets get on to some new business
mister mcmurphy the purpose of this meeting is therapy
yeah yeah the hell with that crap

well screw that noise
mcmurphy rises and taking his chair he crosses toward the television set
sit down mister mcmurphy
mcmurphy turns the tv on flips the channel then sits and waits for a picture
i want you to turn the television off and return to your place
a picture swirls onto the tv screen
the ballgame is in progress documentary footage to be used
martini rushes over and joins mcmurphy
scanlon follows hot on his heels as hoo wee
man all i need me now is a can of beer and a red hot
cheswick gets up and starts across when sit down mister cheswick
cheswick stops and stands there helpless to move
mcmurphy is deep into the game
on the screen a great play is taking place and at the breathtaking moment the tv picture swirls into a little eye of light then nothing
the acutes are left with their mouths hanging open
over loudspeaker i want you men to return to your proper places
the group meeting is not over
mcmurphy continues looking at the blank tv screen as the acutes look from mcmurphy to big nurse not knowing what to do next when jumping up and shouting at the
blank tv screen a hit
its a hit
hes rounding first heading for second
here comes the throw
mcmurphy whistles and claps his hands hoo wee

the acutes are stunned at mcmurphys outburst
over loudspeaker mister mcmurphy you are deliberately violating the rules
hes into his wind up
here comes the pitch

sefelt fredrickson billy and taber get up and cross toward the tv
harding is the only one who doesnt join them

his back is up against the wall

the acutes are shouting cheering stomping and dancing in each others arms
over loudspeaker you men stop this
big nurses last words overload the intercom and the system peaks out
big nurses mouth continues to work in frantic circles as washington miller and warren rush to quell the uproar
doctor spivey is seated behind his desk looking over mcmurphys papers
mcmurphy sits facing him
how are you feeling
just fine doc

good good and how are you getting along on the ward
come on doc you know as well as i do whats been comin down in that loony bin
yes well miss ratched feels that youre a disturbing influence on the other patients
shoot doc the only one im disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways
yes that may be so but in making a careful study of your past record along with your behavior since you arrived here my feeling is that you are not
mentally ill and it is going to be my recommendation that you be returned to pendleton where they are better equipped to handle your case
this is the kiss of death to mcmurphy
come on doc you must be kiddin
im afraid not
jesus that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling dont she
no mister mcmurphy its just that we cannot offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at pendleton
guidance and assistance
doc ya gotta help me
im sorry but i cant keep you here
well let you know
reaction shot of mcmurphy
washington and warren are sitting on the grass watching martini scanlon harding and billy who are positioned on the court waiting on mcmurphy who is under the board with bromden
cheswick and the other patients hang around off court as with great physical and vocal emphasis throughout entire scene okay chief

i dont want you to move from this spot

mcmurphy raises his hands above his head
bromden follows suit

cheswick straining under the weight of mcmurphy turns toward the basket
as bromden chewing his gum watches mcmurphy ease his way out of bed and silently cross down the aisle past the sleep patients toward the day room
as mcmurphy crosses the day room past the nurses station where turkle is asleep
as mcmurphy crosses down the hallway and stops at the mess hall door
he tries the handle
the door is locked
mcmurphy looks up at the open transom ponders it then jumps up and grabs the door lintel
he tries to lift himself up but cant make it when suddenly he is lifted up to the level of the transom by bromden
mcmurphy worms his way through the transom and disappears down the other side
camera holds on bromden who waits
a long beat
there is a strange humming sound heard o

mcmurphy lifts the hood to the bus and begins jumping the wire
the acutes stand helplessly by as the engine turns over and catches
mcmurphy closes the hood and gets on the bus to a chorus of please mac take us back
mcmurphy puts the bus in gear and the bus starts moving
the acutes start running alongside of the bus calling out for mcmurphy to take them back
shouting to them get on assholes
they leap on
as the bus makes a full circle and stops alongside of bromden
waving bromden onto the bus come on chief
bromden boards the bus
mcmurphy lets out a war whoop as he closes the door and starts the bus moving
as the bus picks up speed and churns across the grounds
the acutes look out with wild eyed excitement
as the bus careens out the main entrance and down the thoroughfare
as the acutes cast worried looks at each other
as the bus turns a corner past a sign that reads mcmurphy is singing at the top of his lungs

k kay m mack
singing soo fare the weel darlin
im gone on my way my wagons are loaded my whips in my hand
the dawn is just cracking the horizon as the bus pulls up behind a corroded tin sheet building
a sign reads beyond the boathouse is the dock with several fishing trawlers and beyond that the open sea
the door to the bus opens and mcmurphy gets out
as he steps out of the bus this is it
as mcmurphy walks directly to the wall alongside the door lifts the edge of the siding comes up with a key opens the door and enters
a beat then the lights go on inside the building
the acutes faces pressed against the windows looking out
as mcmurphy lifts a cold bottle of beer out of a coca cola cooler opens it takes a long pull on the bottle then crosses to the heater and turns
nearby a sign reads all equipment can be rented on the walls are old photographs of people with their prize catches
fishing equipment tackle and wet weather gear crowd the room
there is a counter which mcmurphy walks behind and takes a bag of potato chips off a wall rack full of beer nuts hostess cupcakes etc
mcmurphy eyes the keyboard to the fishing boats
several keys are there
with the names of the fishing boats the lark
mcmurphy studying the board as the acutes stick their heads in the door
theyre all miserable and cold
come on in an warm up
you can put some of that gear on to keep warm
an theres beer an coke in the cooler an some food over here
come on dont be shy now youre among friends
the acutes come in bromden bringing up the rear
martini goes for the candy
scanlon goes for the coke
sefelt and fredrickson go for the wet weather gear and boots
the others go to the heater
bromden stands in the middle of the room
why dont one of you boys help ol chief there get warmed up
billy goes to bromdens aid as mcmurphy crosses to a window and looks out
mcmurphy turns and looks out the window
a long beat
when do you think well be going back mack
looking out the window come here a minute cheswick
you too sefelt
hey all you guys come over here i wanna show you somethin
the acutes cross to the window and look out saying what
what is it
whadaya lookin at
i dont see a thing
oh look at the pretty boat
nestled against the dock is a trim fishing trawler beautifully framed in the bay window
yeah did you ever see a boat like that
why ill bet you could go all the way to hawaii in that boat
camera holds on full shot of the boat
a long beat then we see the acutes wearing wet weather gear complete with boots and squall hats each man carrying soda pop food fishing equipment etc
being led onto the boat by mcmurphy who carries a case of beer
as a white gorge of smoke and water pours from the stern and the boat pulls away from the dock leaving a boiling foam of water
the entire crew is jammed into the bridge mcmurphy behind the wheel
mcmurphys pov as the dock and other fishing boats slip by
as the boat passes out of the harbor and heads for the open sea
the sun is up
the engine is dead
the ballgame is heard over ships radio
the men are scattered over the boat
taber and mcmurphy beer in hand are sunning themselves listening to the ballgame
on the stern martini and scanlon are trying to rig up a pole
fredrickson gives them a hand
billy has a line out
so does bromden and sefelt who is seated nearby fishing the ocean floor when he suddenly gets a bite and looks over the side surprised
his line goes straight down into the depths
his glasses fall off into the water
sefelt sighs and slowly begins reeling his line in
billy gets a strike and starts fighting the fish
h h help
ease up on the star drag keep the tie up up and work hell outta that fella
martini gets a strike and loses it
scanlon comes up and starts to take the pole from him
hanging onto the pole no
they start a tug of war
fredrickson tries to break it up when he gets a strike and his line spins out
billys fish breaks into the sun in a shower of silver scales and he gets so excited he lets the end of the pole go down and the line snaps
up i told you
keep that tip up
you had you one big silver there
fredrickson lands his salmon in a spray of scales and blood
the fish is flopping all over the deck
billy grabs the fish and wrestles it down
bromden lands a fish when oh my god
i see something
everyone rushes over to sefelt and looks down into the water
deep down in the water a gigantic white form slowly rises out of the depths becoming solid alive
what is it
well never get that on the boat
the fish is now clearly seen
calling m m mack
m m mack
mcmurphy pulls himself up
what is it kid
c c come here and l look at th this
mcmurphy crosses down and looks over the side
hes a big flounder
could weigh two three hundred
you got to lift him in with a winch
does that mean we have to cut him loose
like hell we will
we got the muscle standing right here
all we need is a couple gaffin hooks and some rope
i i ill get them
mcmurphy turns to sefelt who is sweating under the strain
steady does it sefelt
the massive fish is closer to the surface
all the men are standing by as gaffing hooks and rope are made ready
the fish is gaffed and slowly hauled out of the water
mcmurphy and bromden lean over held by the others grab the big fish by its gills and with a heave ho the fish is slid in and flopped to the
bottom of the boat
the men go sprawling over the big fish
theres a lot of laughter handshakes and back slapping going on when over bull horn all right
the men look up
off the bow is a coast guard cutter and on the deck stands doctor spivey washington warren and several other aides dressed in white
as the acutes sunburned and covered with dried brine and fish scales are escorted down the hallway by washington warren and doctor spivey
its a triumphant procession as they wheel the giant flounder with a sheet over it on a gurney holding up their catches for all to see
mcmurphy is lagging a bit behind as they pass the mess hall where workmen are busy installing a security screen over the transom while inside the mess hall another workman
is seen welding a lock on the dumbwaiter
as big nurse steps out of the nurses station
to big nurse here they are miss ratched
safe and sound
well boys did you enjoy yourselves
a burst of exuberance as the inmates hold up their fish
to sefelt show her the one you caught jim
sefelt whips the sheet off the big fish
no one can find superlatives or gestures big enough to describe his catching of the big fish brought it in himself ad lib
yeah ya shouldve come along with us miss ratched an gotten a little sun on your cheeks and maybe caught a fish or two
mcmurphy you had no right to take these men out with you
loudly yeah thats kind of crazy aint it
no it was irresponsible
big nurse turns to the others leaving mcmurphy dangling
respectfully thats quite a catch jim
whaat are you going to do with it
crossing to mcmurphy gimme a cigarette
i thought i might donate it to the mess hall
reaches in his pocket he has none i dont have any
ad libs they could use it
take a picture first
thats an excellent idea
now why dont you boys place your fish on the gurney and well see to it that everyone enjoys a fresh fish dinner
the men toss their fish on the gurney as martini joins the group and starts hitting the others up for a cigarette
all he gets for his troubles are a series of no get lost i dont have any
thank you boys
now if youll just go along with mister washington to the showers supper is in half an hour
the inmates start ad libbing and laughing were not hungry as martini sees harding light up a cigarette and crosses to him
to harding gimme a cigarette
im not running a charity ward
martini snaps the cigarette out of hardings hand and takes off with harding chasing him
martini dashes around the room pulling chairs in hardings way taking a drag on the cigarette whenever he can
harding corners martini but martini tosses the cigarette over hardings head to scanlon
scanlon takes off with harding after him absolutely livid
scanlon passes to billy who passes to martini
everyone in the room is getting wired
martini throws it away as harding jumps him and nails him to the floor
holding his hands up empty all gone
harding starts pounding martinis head on the floor when billy and scanlon jump harding and start pounding him
fredrickson picks up the cigarette and stands there watching the fight as he smokes the cigarette as washington warren and miller move in and start separating the men
mcmurphy watching the fight sighs then deliberately crosses toward the nurses station
as mcmurphy reaches the nurses station and puts his hand through the plate glass window his fist stopping inches from miss pilbows startled face
miss pilbows scream is added to the sound of the shattered window
mcmurphy reaches in and picks up his carton of cigarettes
im sure sorry maam
gawd but i am
that window glass was so clean i didnt even see it
mcmurphy turns and crosses back to the day room opening the carton of cigarettes as he goes
you guys want cigarettes
heres the goddamn cigarettes
mcmurphy starts tossing packages of cigarettes into the mass of struggling bodies as washington grabs mcmurphy by the arm and tries to wheel him away
mcmurphy shakes him off and throws a pack of cigarettes in washingtons face
washington goes after mcmurphy grabs him and drives him against the wall right next to bromden who watches as mcmurphy shoves washington away goes into a crouch and starts circling
washington dances in and out chipping away at mcmurphys face until mcmurphy drives his fist square into washingtons white starched chest drawing him against the wall
mcmurphy moves in for the kill
the acutes have stopped fighting and are watching
mcmurphy tags washington then is grabbed from behind by warren who pulls him back
washington moves in and goes to work on mcmurphy when bromden grabs washington from behind in a bear hug
miller jumps on bromdens back
bromden still holding washington backs up into the wall squashing miller who screams out
as mcmurphy bruised from the fight and bromden handcuffed to a special belt wait while an aide unlocks the first of a double set of heavy security doors
the first door is locked leaving mcmurphy bromden and the three aides crammed in the small space between the two doors while another aide opens the second door and mcmurphy
and bromden step through followed by the aides
as the aide locks the door behind them the other aides lead bromden and mcmurphy toward a bench where they unshackle them
pointing to a bench wait over there
the three aides go down the hall leaving mcmurphy and bromden who sit and look at their new surroundings
there is a man sitting next to them
mcmurphys pov the architecture is the same as the ward we left below but it is the atmosphere that is different
a heaviness pervades all
heavily sedated patients sit isolated from each other
others stand shifting from one foot to the other while others walk up and down the hallway their locomotive powers not unlike that of parkinsons disease caused by too much
suddenly one patient gets up speaking very angrily shouting incoherently at no one he crosses the hall and enters a side room
an aide goes in after him
a long beat then the aide comes out with the patient and gently leads him back to his seat talking softly to the man
further down the hallway a gurney is wheeled out of the east room with a patient lying on it out cold he is wheeled further down the hall to the
mens dorms where he is left to sleep it off
two aides come out of the est room and head in mcmurphys direction where one of the aides motions to the patient sitting next to mcmurpby
approaching him very gently come on joey
this isnt going to hurt you
good for you
make you feel better
the patient clings to the bench terrified weeping
the aides peel him off the bench and escort him down the hall to the est room
as mcmurphy watches the patient go he takes out a package of gum
takes a stick for himself and gives bromden one
mcmurphy turns back to his own thoughts
mcmurphy looks up
a long beat
say it again
god bless america
god bless america
slapping his thigh goddammit you sly son of a bitch
does anybody else know
this is too much
his mind going a mile a minute chief i tell you were gonna bust outta this place an make it all the way to canada before they know what bit

oh man i tell you i tell you youll have women trippin you and beating you to the floor
ca na da

mcmurphy turns to see nurse itsu
the two aides are standing behind her
recognizing a long lost friend hey how ya doin

what are they
to help you relax
mcmurphy takes the pills and downs them
bromden takes his pills

mcmurphy takes off his shoes

mcmurphy flanked by the two aides follows nurse itsu to the est room
to itsu you know i never got your name
stopping at the door miss itsu
indicating the room in here please
you comin in to hold my hand
well see ya around itsu
itsu smiles at mcmurphy
mcmurphy gives bromden one last wave and goes in
bromden watches the door close behind mcmurphy
there are four other aides in there standing around an empty gurney
a doctor is at the head of the gurney a nurse alongside of him
as he enters hi
mcmurphy looks around at the six aides
you boys can take a cigarette break now
the nurse smiles at him
thats all right mister mcmurphy just climb on the bed and lie down
whatever you say doc
mcmurphy climbs on the bed and lies down
the doctor moves around to the side of the bed and takes mcmurphys pulse while the nurse dips her fingers into a jar of salve
to mcmurphy this wont hurt you at all
the nurse starts applying salve to mcmurphys temples
whats that for
smiling up at her surely goodness and mercy will follow this eh honey
holding a mouthpiece please put this in your mouth
mcmurphy takes the bit in his teeth
the doctor moves back to the head of the gurney and places the thongs on mcmurphys temples
the doctor nods to the six aides who move in and gently place their hands in a very professional manner on mcmurphys knees hips and shoulders
once set the doctor turns to his controls
shot of mcmurphy as he looks around not nearly as scared as he is mystified by the whole process when suddenly without warning mcmurphy is hit by the shock
his face is a contorted mask of surprise and pain
his whole body caught in a sudden spasm
a moment of rigidity then mcmurphy passes out and his body relaxes
another moment then a series of violent body spasms begin flowing down his body
now the aides function is very clear as they press down holding mcmurphy firmly to the gurney until the last spasm subsides
a group meeting is in progress
doctor spivey is there
to sefelt its been brought to my attention that youre giving mister fredrickson your medication arent you mister sefelt
its the dilantin that makes my gums soft
now jim you must be honest with yourself
at the end of the hall the door opens and mcmurphy and bromden enter the visitors room accompanied by washington and warren
they cross to the security gate open it and pass into the hallway
washington and warren disappear into a room leaving mcmurphy and bromden who walk slowly towards the day room
the group meeting continues over as fredrickson raises his hand
yes mister fredrickson
i wanna know why the dorm has to be locked in the daytime and on weekends
yeah why cant a fellow even have the weekends to himself
standing up yeah whadabout our cigarettes
sit down mister cheswick and wait your turn
if the dorms were left open you would just return to bed after breakfast
is it a mortal sin
i mean normal people get to sleep late on weekends
with few exceptions time spent in the company of others is therapeutic while every minute spent brooding alone only increases separation
jumping up as he sees mcmurphy mack
everyone looks at mcmurphy and bromden
bromden is as he always was as mcmurphy slowly drags himself into the day room
he looks like a zombie as he takes the room in
then suddenly he slaps his thigh
mcmurphy hey hey you ding a lings you creeps you goons
he enters the room doing a jig
the acutes faces light up
i got ten thousand watts and hot to trot
first woman takes me on is gonna light up like a pinball machine an pay off in silver dollars
mcmurphy does a full circle of the room greeting the chronics
but its an effort for him
his voice is slower his footwork slightly out of sync
h h hows it g g going mack

full of piss an vinegar

mcmurphy gets up and crosses to the window where he joins bromden who is looking out the window
reaction shot of the others as they look at mcmurphy and each other with quizzical looks
on the court both teams are lined up taking photographs for the local newspaper
the bulb pops a few times
wrapping it up thank you boys
the line breaks up
mcmurphy crosses to big nurse who sits in the front row
its the big saturday game between the acutes and aides as spectators enter the gymnasium already half filled with male and female patients staff members and visitors
doctor spivey stands nearby at the timers table basketball in hand whistle around his neck talking to the timer
miss ratched would you please save a space for my aunt
shes comin down from portland
certainly mister mcmurphy with pleasure
thank you maam
the whistle blows

mcmurphy crosses onto the court
big nurse watches him go
doctor spivey is at half court basketball in hand as the players take up their positions washington faces mcmurphy for the jump at center
harding and billy are playing guard with warren and miller on them
martini and scanlon are in the forward position with the two white aides covering them
the other acutes sit on the bench as substitutes

spivey checks the court then blows the whistle as he tosses the ball into the air
washington taps the ball to warren who passes to miller who hands off to washington who goes up for a layup
the acutes havent even moved from their spots
the scoreboard reads aides patients

the acutes snap to and mcmurphy passes the ball into harding who fiercely dribbles down court mcmurphy running alongside him
pass the ball harding
no pass dont hang onto it

harding dribbles into the corner and finds himself bottled in by two aides
harding here over here
the ball is snagged from hardings hands by an aide who passes it down court to another aide who turns and makes another basket

mcmurphy stops dead in his tracks and flings the ball at harding
the ball bounces off hardings head and goes out of bounds
the whistle blows
harding spins a few times

harding turns to see the other team go by

billy takes the ball and passes into mcmurphy who turns to see candy enter the gym with her friend rose

mcmurphy dribbles the ball down the sideline
goes into his routine of ball tricks faking one way then the other over his head under his legs finally ending on a pass behind his back which goes straight
into washingtons hands
washington dribbles down court for an easy layup
score aides patients to spivey time out
blowing his whistle time out
shouting to timer replacement coming in
mcmurphy crosses to bromden takes his hand and leads him onto the court and under the acutes basket where he maneuvers him into the proper position

under the aides basket harding passes the ball into mcmurphy who dribbles to half court takes his mark and lobs the ball over the outstretched arms of the aides right
into bromdens waiting hands
bromden turns and slams the ball into the basket
the crowd goes bananas
score aides patients bromden walks in majestic dignity the full length of the court and takes up his position under the aides basket while mcmurphy and his teammates have been
putting tremendous pressure on the aides not allowing them to pass the ball in
as soon as mcmurphy sees that bromden is firmly set hands held up under the aides basket mcmurphy turns and runs down court followed by the other acutes where they
take up their defensive position
washington and the aides easily bring the ball down court work themselves into position and take a shot at the basket which bromden swats aside
each aide gets a shot at the basket and each time bromden swats it aside sending the last swat into mcmurphys waiting hands
mcmurphy dribbles the ball up court where he runs into heavy pressure from washington
off to the side of mcmurphy mcmurphy pass the ball
mcmurphy passes the ball to harding and cuts toward the basket

on the court mcmurphy dribbles down to half court where he is stopped by washington and warren who put the squeeze on him
mcmurphy turns and gives them his ass to contend with then manages to throw the ball under his legs and washingtons legs
the ball rolls to martini who scoops it up and throwing it wildly away the ball ricochets off the backboard and goes in for two points
the crowd goes bananas
score aides patients bromden starts striding down court when the aides make a fast break past him but miss their shot
mcmurphy retrieves the ball as bromden not more than several feet from his own basket does an about face and returns to his basket where he turns to see mcmurphy
lob the ball full court to bromden who catches the ball on one bounce turns and slams the ball in for another basket
score aides patients the crowd goes bananas and bromden turns and starts striding down the court when he sees mcmurphy at the far end of the court yelling at him
yelling and gesturing run chief run
bromden gets the idea and starts loping down court abreast of washington who is making another fast break towards his own basket
washington and bromden go up together and bromden swats the ball to scanlon
yelling and gesturing run chief run
bromden starts running towards his own basket washington hot on his heels when the ball is passed to him and he goes up makes the point but takes a bad
spill crashing head over heels to the floor

bromden takes the ball at the foul line

the patients are asleep except for bromden who sits on the edge of his bed watching mcmurphy his face pressed against the window looking out
approaching what you boys doin up at this ungodly time o the night

the men slide into their beds and turkle goes off clucking to himself

mcmurphys pov outside in the dark candy and rose are seen wandering around
reverse angle bromden and mcmurphy there they are chief
mcmurphy tries to get the girls attention and fails

washington nods to warren and the two of them scoop billy off the floor and carry him screaming to doctor spiveys office as big nurse crosses into the nurses station
and picks up the phone as candy eases her way into the day room and joins mcmurphy

big nurse and nurse pilbow rush out of the nurses station and head down the hallway
mcmurphy is glued to the spot
calling from outside come on come on lets go
mcmurphy hesitates then moves across the day room toward the hallway
camera shooting toward the door crammed full of patients who stare at the scene with curious detached looks as big nurse and nurse pilbow force their way through the patients
the crowd parts and big nurse stops in the doorway horrified at what she sees
camera holds on big nurses reaction
a beat then mcmurphy appears alongside big nurse and is stricken by what he sees
mcmurphy and big nurses pov reverse shot doctor spiveys the office is splattered with blood
billy is lying face up hanging over spiveys desk dead
his throat and both wrists are cut
a broken picture frame containing a photograph of spiveys family lies nearby

mcmurphy crosses into the room and kneels alongside billys body
he gently lays his hand on billys face
get away from him

mcmurphy turns and leaps at big nurse grabbing her throat he drives her into the acutes and nurse pilbow
as mcmurphy big nurse nurse pilbow and several acutes go down arms and legs intertwined kicking trying to get away as mcmurphy strangles big nurse
nurse pilbow screaming as washington warren miller rush in trying to break his hold on big nurses throat her face turning blue
mcmurphys face twisted by his passion when washington lands a rabbit punch and memurphys face relaxes as he passes out
music over loudspeaker
the day room is as it was in the beginning
harding is dealing out a game of blackjack to martini scanlon cheswick and fredrickson
taber pencil in band sits pondering over a blank sheet of paper
ruckly is turning a grimy photograph over in his hands
bancini sits wagging his head mumbling over and over tired
ellis stands against the wall arms outstretched
over last scene in mcmurphys style okay suckers place your bets
bromden is mopping the floor near the security gate to the visitors room when a key hits the lock
bromden looks up expectantly
as sefelt and miller enter the visitors room cross to the security gate and pass into the hallway
bromden goes back to his mopping
as sefelt jauntily enters the day room
through loudspeaker did everything go well mister sefelt
sefelt turns to the nurses station where inside big nurse sits very erect wearing a back brace that reaches up around her neck
sefelt shows his teeth and gums to big nurse
through loudspeaker thats very nice
now doesnt that make you feel better mister sefelt
she turns back to her work
sefelt crosses to the card game where he sits and catches fredricksons attention showing him his teeth
fredrickson smiles at sefelt and blows him a kiss

harding slams his card down on the table rises and crosses to the nurses station where he taps on the side window
big nurse gets up crosses to the window and slides it open
yes mister harding
is it true mcmurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday
mister harding that is not true
bromden is squatting leaning against the wall near the security gate to the visitors room when a key hits the lock
he looks up expectantly
this time it is mcmurphy
or what was mcmurphy for his head is bandaged and his tongue hangs out of his mouth as he is led across the visitors room by an attendant
mcmurphy shows bromden no sign of recognition which bromden pays no attention to thinking mcmurphy is putting on the same act he did when he came back from electro shock
bromden joyously turns and runs down the hallway to the day room
as bromden crosses into the day room gets a seat and sits facing the hallway bursting with expectation
a long beat then the attendant appears with mcmurphy and taps at the side door to the nurses station
the acutes break off their card game and look at mcmurphy their faces hang open at his appearance
big nurse crosses to the side door opens it and steps out into the day room
to the attendant as she takes mcmurphy by the arm thank you
the attendant exits
to mcmurphy now lets find you a place to sit shall we mister mcmurphy
big nurse gently guides mcmurphy to a seat on the chronics side of the room
bromden can hardly contain himself as he waits for mcmurphy to go into his act
the acutes have already absorbed the reality of mcmurphys condition as they exchange looks with each other
yeah that gary blinker is fulla shit
the acutes turn back to their card game as harding shuffles and deals the cards out
bromden keeps his eyes glued to big nurse and mcmurphy
sitting mcmurphy down here now you sit here
big nurse pats mcmurphys face and crosses back to the nurses station
mcmurphy just sits there his head lolling to one side
bromden waits for mcmurphy to go into his routine
mcmurphy just sits there
bromden snaps his fingers and slaps his thigh then waits for mcmurphy to follow suit
mcmurphy just sits there slobbering
bromden slaps his thigh again
no response from mcmurphy
the music plays on
as bromden stands by the window looking out
a long beat then he turns into the room and looks around
the patients are all asleep
the new night attendant is fast asleep in the nurses station
bromden quietly takes his pillow and goes to mcmurphys bed where he kneels and puts his head very close to mcmurphys
a long beat as bromden studies mcmurphys face
whispering in mcmurphys ear when i first came here i was so scared of being lost i had to holler so they could track me
i figured anything was better than being lost
on the last word bromden places his pillow over mcmurphys face and begins to suffocate him
mcmurphy starts thrashing and bromden lies full length on mcmurphy
a long beat then the thrashing ends
bromden gets off mcmurphy replaces his pillow and crosses down the aisle toward the day room
the night attendant continues to sleep as bromden passes the nurses station heading for the tub room
as bromden crosses to the heavy machine which mcmurphy had once tried to lift sizes it up then bends over and takes hold and heaves
the grinding weight is heard as bromden exerts all his strength slowly lifts the machine off the floor balances it above his shoulders then crosses out of the tub room
as bromden comes around the corner and past the sleeping night attendant in the nurses station
bromden lines himself up with the window across the room then starts toward it picking up speed as he goes
then at the last moment he stops and with an enormous effort he hurls the machine through the security screen and the window
in the nurses station the night attendant starts awake and looks around
too late as bromden vaults through the window
camera holds on window as bromden runs across the grounds and disappears into the pine trees
as the night attendant comes out of the nurses station and looks confusedly around
then he spots the shattered window
rolling hills forests and distant mountains bathed in sunlight as bromden runs across a far off meadow
