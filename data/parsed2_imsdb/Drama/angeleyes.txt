by gerald dipego october seventh draft polish as opening credits play we study the citys nighttime pulse ribbons of headlights moving and cross connecting like blood through the veins of
a body impressionistic even beautiful but what were hearing is soulful trumpet based music mellow and haunting the modern classic jazz sound of a wynton marsalis putting a voice to our story
as credits end we
now the music is gone sounds are muffled and vision blurred
we get the impression of urgent movement
we hear breathing
there are voices shouts even screams but muffled far away
only the breathing is distinct
we come to realize it is our breathing and we are inside someone looking out
the man whose pov this is is on the edge of consciousness and not far from death
he lies on the pavement of a freeway at the site of an accident only minutes after impact
his vision goes in and out of clarity
people are swarming around him and rushing by toward the carnage of wrecked vehicles
a siren blooms in the distance and approaches haltingly
the man slips away comes back toward consciousness slips again
the crowd around the downed man parts to allow passage to a police officer
it is a woman officer sharon pogue lapd
she kneels at the mans side taking charge speaking but we hear only slivers of sound
he sees her face clearly now close above him
sharon is a dedicated professional and more
we see down into her to a place of real caring
she stares into our eyes and connects
we begin to hear her now and there are more sirens converging in b
can you hear me
shouting off this ones conscious
paramedics on the way
we are slipping away again
sharon holds us with her eyes and she grips our hand
listen to me
can you feel that
she holds on tight
we see that our hand held in her own is bloody
thats my hand
go on as hard as you can
we watch our hand gripping hers and as we hold on the sights and sounds around us grow more clear
its over and ive got you and youre safe
youre safe now
you got that
dont let go
dont let me go
but our eyes unlock from sharons and drift to a patch of night sky
her voice fades awawy
our pov begins to lift moving toward that sky as the blue black night begins to turn white
we go into that white light and
we pick out a police car from the traffic and follow
the beat being patrolled is a mixed neighborhood with some very rough edges
officer sharon pogue is driving the car
it is two years since we saw her at the accident site
her partner robby lewis sips coffee and keeps one eye on the cad monitor which lists all area police calls
she slows behind a car that is crawling along an old s car driven by a young man and woman who sit very close on the bench seat
the cars engine is missing and smoking
that car is older than they are
thats what i said
needs a servicing
dont we all
robby nearly spits his coffee laughing at what sharon has said and trying not to choke
sharon smiles shaking her head
get it together officer
as robby smiles sharon looks ahead at the young couple who each have an arm around the other
she is stroking his neck
he is making gentle circles in her hair
sharon watches this and for a moment her eyes reveal a depth that may be loneliness but she quickly pushes her thoughts away and hits the horn startling robby and
startling the people ahead who now disengage and drive on
almost spilled my coffee again
you didnt like his hair or what
i love elvis hair
they were going two damn miles an hour
but robbys eyes have caught something on the monitor
lets roll to this fight in progress
as robby secures that coffee cup sharon hits the siren and speeds around the car in front of them
at the same time a few blocks away an old frail man is carrying two plastic grocery bags that are too heavy for him
walking behind this man is a younger man named catch lambert an attractive man with some scarring on his face
his eyes deep down are haunted by something but there is energy in his step
he is dressed in a relaxed and stylish manner not expensive
he begins to pick up his pace to catch up to the old man
people glance at catch nad he glances back in an open and unflinching way ready for anything a smile a nod or because these are some of l
s mean streets a threatening or taunting look
these he also meets openly without a trace of fear
the man has been through some kind of fire and it has left him different from us
outside the usual boundaries
catch walks beside the old man glancing at him
finally the man glances back wondering and suspicious but catch has a slight disarming smile open and honest
since were both walking the same way i could take one of those bags for you
that way i do some upper body work while im walking along
helps my back
what dyou say
the old man trudges on proud and suspicious too
right now your minds making pictures of me robbing your groceires but yknow nine times out of ten people do the right thing
the old man glances at him still not convinced but he soon has to stop and rest
catch stops too
the old man looks at him a bit embarrassed
its the dog food that makes it so heavy
catch nods puts out his hand
the old man hesitates then decides and lifts a bag and catch takes it
i guess its worth it
for a good dog
catch isnt kidding
he has that honesty
the old man nods and starts trudging again
as they walk on together catch reaches for that second bag
the man relents and lets him take it
they continue on catch carrying the bags and every now and then lifting them a bit for his upper body work
this is the call sharon and robby have sped to
it is a chaotic scene of cops breaking up a fight between eight boys
a big kid or so is being pulled off another by sharon and robby
the kid is wild and resisting and sharon shows her toughness and professionalism and some anger too as she slams him into a fence and robby holds him while she
cuffs the young man who is very mouthy playing to his friends
look at this bitch
benny look at this
sharon and robby are both very good at their jobs taking this kid to their car while other cops contain the rest
a crowd watches mostly teens
to sharon you come in with me
some of his bystanders friends howl at that
youre going to arrest me you come into the back seat with me
he resists a bit but theyre getting him into the car
well have a good time
sharons on the radio to dispatch as robby drives and the kid keeps mouthing off
to radio three adam five show us to the jail with one male prisoner
take off your uniform
take off my handcuffs bitch and come back here
i want one touch
give it a rest
sharon is stone faced through this
if youre going to put me away you gotta give me one sweet touch
as robby and sharon bring their suspect to the booking counter each holding one of his cuffed arms
the kid is looking at sharons hand on his arm
that aint the touch
that aint the touch i want
they get him to the counter
as i remove your cuffs i want you to put your hands here
spread your legs
as they remove the cuffs the kid makes a sudden move toward sharon reaching between her legs but she was not only ready for this but hoping for it and
the stoniness of her face cracks into fierce anger as she moves quickly and grabs the kid by the hair bringing his face into her upraised knee
he cries out and goes down on his knees hurting and bleeding
the jailer rushes over to help but robby grabs the kids wrists
back off john we got it
robby glances at sharon a dark glance
as robby and sharon walk to their car
they are interrupted by one of their lieutenants sanderman walking their way and stopping to stare at sharon
she meets his look
you trying to be a bad ass pogue
she is straightforward not rebellious
i just dealt with the situation
and you dont see a pattern here
pause i want you to keep yourself way inside the line instead of walking on it
are you taking notes
he walks away and sharon and robby walk on to their car she is dark he is glancing at her
you broke his nose
he grabbed me
end of story
and you were waiting for him
you were hoping
you were making long range plans for his ass while he was mouthing off in the car and youre supposed to be above that shit
if you think i crossed the line put it in the report
pogo stop the shit
what is it
you pissed off at me too
they enter the car sharon behind the wheel
not you rob
youre a rare unthreatened male cop with a good marriage and you like to eat where i eat so everythings code four
she starts the car and starts to back out and he reaches over and turns off the ignition
she stares hotly at him but then slowly she softens takes a deep breath
come over for dinner tonight
ill call charlene
shed like to see you
its been awhile
well talk about it
she starts the car again more calm starts to drive out of the lot
but shell invite friends try and fix me up
shes always trying to fix me up so she doesnt have to worry about you and me
she doesnt worry about that
they all worry about that
they both smile wryly driving on
you dont need to fix me robby or fix me up
i dont want some guy to heart and soul me and then walk away cause he cant stand the cop thing or worse he wants cop stories every night cause
it turns him on and he has no idea who i am inside my head
anyway im busy tonight
got some action huh
well thats promising
hot and heavy
she is on the floor using an exercise rig sliding into crunches pushing herself sweating alone
we begin drifting to the rain spattered window as night sounds filter in horns someone shouting a car moving by with thunderous bass music that pulses the very air and
rattles the loose glass of her window
catch lambert is walking the wet streets head down in the rain
far away we hear that car with a bass blasting
in the glow of a street lamp catch sees a bright colored object in the gutter
he picks it up out of the gurgling rain water
it is a small toy a discarded superhero
he puts it in his pocket walks on
now the car the prowling music blasting bass thundering car turns a corner and begins rollling along slowly beside catch
he glances over walking on
there are four tough looking men in the car looking for trouble
the music is deafening
catch glances again walks on
their eyes follow him like gun barrels
he stops and walks out on the street moving toward the car shouting over the music
you want to turn that volume down
whats your point
the men incredulous stop the car and snap off the music in order to make sure theyre hearing right
they stare death at catch
what did you say
whats the point of blasting your music through the whole zip code
dont you realize there are kids trying to sleep in these apartments old people sick people
they can hardly believe this
you better watch your mouth asshole
catch meets the mans look with his own unflinching haunted eyes
whatre you gonna do
catchs look is not a macho challenge
its something else beyond that a man somehow without limits
one of the riders in the backseat taps the drivers shoulder
the driver never breaking his death stare snaps on the deafening music and then slowly rolls on still glaring at catch
catch stands in the rain watching them go
catch is arriving home soaking wet
he lives in a slightly seedy three story
as he walks down the corridor toward his apaprtment he passes a neighbors door and notices a set of keys dangling from the lock
he pauses and then knocks softly on the door
someone looks through the peephole and then opens the door a young single mother friendly but with a little caution too
she recognizes catch
behind her is a little boy five
the womans name is candace
her son is tommy
your keys are in the
he gestures and she sees the keys and retrieves them more friendly now
oh thank you
thanks a lot
i was trying to carry tommy and all these bags
he was so tired
of course as soon as i put him down he had all this energy
while she is talking catch is staring deeply at the boy who is shy
catch almost speaks to the boy wants to goes halfway to a smile but the sight of the kid stirs that layer of darkness in catch
he nods a good bye to the mother and is about to go
she thinks about this as he is turning and pushes through her remaining caution to say
yknow we were just baking nectarine bars because the peaches werent ripe
ever had a nectarine bar
he smiles and seems to want to stay but he is already retreating
his contact goes only so far and no further
gotta be going
and with one more glance at the boy he walks to his apartment unlocks it and steps in
he walks into a bare living room no chairs tables lamps nothing on the walls
he walks into a spotless never used kitchen and flips on the light opens a drawer
in the drawer is a collection of kids toys some found some purchased mostly plastic figures
the action of opening the door has started some battery operated animals moving around in there
now from his pocket he takes the plastic superhero he just found and drops it in and closes the drawer
he walks back into the living room
he sits on the floor leans back against the wall his clothes still soaked from the rain
he stares at his thoughts looking a bit numb and lost
sharon is just leaving with a clean uniform on a hanger in a plastic bag
its a neighborhood place where alterations are done
as she is leaving an older woman is just entering
this is mrs
vander beaming at sharon a real talker
youre looking good
oh you just wait
she is pulling a new blue dress out of a shopping bag
its for the church and the party
its just a little too long
yknow i cried over the invitation just imagine me in church
laughs itll be so good to spend time with you
sharon forces a smile but is mystified
vander is walking to the counter and pausing to say
you know dan and i renewed our vows last year
i bet thats where your mom got the idea
your mom and dad the ceremony
vander realizes whats going on and stammers on sympathetic and embarrassed
yknow i just got that invitation a few
just now so im sure youll
theres been some problems with the mail in our building so
ill probably get it today
theyre both covering like mad both realizing sharons been left out
so i guess ill see you
ill see you there
sharon leaves mrs
vander staring after her feeling bad
as sharon walks away we see her forced smile die replaced by an old pain and darkness
robby and sharons unit pulls up at a house remodel with a sign marked pogue construction
sharon exits the car and walks onto the site moves toward a man who is both carpenter and supervisor on the job
this is her brother larry pogue
they are not comfortable with each other an old wound
he gives her a wary nod
shes trying a little harder being a bit more friendly
we can sense the strain
i didnt see his truck so
hes not here
how you doing
she touches his shoulder as she says this a friendly gesture a reaching out
he doesnt respond only shrugs
kathy and the boy
bet hes big now
is he looking more like you now or did he get lucky
she has broken through a bit and they both smile a brief wry smile
hes got kathys looks and brains and my strong back
you should feel his grip
pause you just passing by
she looks about
place is coming along nice
the octagon window
but larrys look stays on her wondering whats on her mind
look larry i shouldnt have to hear it from mrs
vander about whats happening
he turns back to his work now as they speak uncomfortable
hurt so you really werent going to tell me
nobody was going to tell me
mom and dad renewing their vows the church the party
vander is all excited
she bought a new dress
were workin on dad
we think you should be there
we told him
mom told him
we mentioned it
hes holding out hah
you want to come
its my family
its over ten years and he wont let go of it
you two were always head to head
for good reason
lets just leave it
she stares then
youre still scared of him
pissed he throws his hammer down on the plywood turns to her
i dont think its a good idea you coming around here in uniform
people see it they think were in trouble here
nice seeing you too
she walks away
he frowns picks up his hammer goes back to work
as sharon walks towards the car she sees a van approaching and she holds up a hand to robby and calls out
two more minutes
and she walks toward the oncoming van which is parking now
the van is driven by kathy sharons brothers wife
beside her in a car seat is larry jr
four years old
sharon comes to the rolled down window on the drivers side
she has a warm smile for kathy and the child
kathy smiles too
look its your auntie sharon
hey champ my god look how big
she has a special affection for the boy who is subdued but he smiles a small one for his aunt
she takes one of his hands and they shake in mock formality
you hurt my hand with that grip
she shakes her fingers and he smiles a bit more
sharon reaches in and rubs his head in a mock knuckling move
she smooths his hair affectionately
were bringing larry his lunch
hey its good to see you
its been awhile
sharon is staring at kathys badly bruised ear
oh i went boom into a low shelf chasing after him of course
nodding to the child howre you doing
sharon pulls her eyes off the bruise to meet kathys look and connect
im semi okay
i heard about the
ceremony and the party
i hope youll be there
sharon smiles a bit appreciating the support
she pats kathys arm
take it easy
you too champ
the boy offers his little hand to shake again
youre not breaking my fingers again
they smile and drive on and sharon walks toward her car and robby
we watch moms and kids and a basketball game in the park and pick up catch walking by
two pre teens are playing bounce and catch with a rubber ball against a tennis practice wall and one of them misses and catch makes a lunge and snags the
instead of throwing it to one of the boys he fires it at the wall
one of the boys catches it bounces it off the wall toward catch
catch grabs it and now hes part of this rapid fire game and hes athletic and funny too playing hard and mugging and making them smile until
a police car comes roaring down the boulevard slowing a bit to chirp its siren a few times clearing traffic
catch glances up and sees
sharon is in the car beside robby
stunned by the sight of her and he doesnt know why
he cant move cant breathe eyes fixed on her
the police car pulls around a truck and roars on and thats when he is struck by a memory a little like lightning
it comes as a quick the man near death
sharon is bending close to him this all just a sliver of an image and it jolts him
the police car is now converging with other squads just half a block away
catch throws the ball back to the boys and runs toward the police incident
the boys watch him go wondering
a police car is parked askew near this closed store as now robby and sharons unit roars to a stop beside it
two cops are calling and motioning to them one holds a shotgun
this is ray juliette
break in alarm
one suspect in nobody out
take the back
and they are moving
robby and sharon are hurrying around to the back as we hear more police units converging in front
as catch arrives on the scene and sees sharon and robby moving around the building to the back
he is still amazed at the sight of her
he decides to follow her keeping her in sight driven
they are scouting through crates and weeds as a young man is flushed from cover at the back of the store and runs from them
the man runs on and sharon chases with robby close behind her
sharon speaks to her shoulder radio mike as she runs
to radio three a foot pursuit
suspect fleeing south on pico place young man green jacket
no visible weapon
to robby robby
right behind you
to man stop and lie down with your arms
the man has jumped a fence
i see him
she goes over the fence then robby
the man runs and sharon chases
robby not far behind glances off to the side seeing catch still following
citizen on your right
but sharon is now closing on the fleeing man who turns suddenly pointing a handgun
and sharon wide eyed is already pulling her weapon but not in time
the man is aiming at her and about to fire when he is tackled by catch
catch and the man go sprawling and the gun flies out of the mans hand and sharon is on him in an instant pointing her gun at him
catch scrambles to his feet
robby joins sharon and puts his knee in the mans back and cuffs him then glances at catch
so does sharon
but catch starts to hurry off
two other cops ray juliette and sanchez rush toward the suspect on the ground
you got him
he was armed
citizen took him down
sharon stares across the lot to where catch has halted
more cops are converging
ray juliette and sanchez move toward catch while a sergeant and others surround sharon and the suspect
in between the crowd of cops catch and sharon glance at each other during
as the cops reach him
what happened here
just saw it and
i saw the gun so
you all right pogo
she is shaken speaks softly
i was dead
she glances toward catch
she doesnt recognize him from the accident
their eyes meet briefly but then their attention is pulled to the others
sharon speaks to her sergeant
he had me
i was dead
he is shaken too
sanchez is taking notes as ray checks his i
i was just walking by
i live near here
ray nods handing the i
sergeants going to want to talk to you mr
well need a statement
dont worry about it
thats just procedure
look we appreciate what you did
let us buy you a drink tonight all right
you know where the rib house is
catch glances at sharon again and he nods
catch a bit bruised and dirty from his tackle is carrying groceries up the walkway steps to a small well kept home
he is taking out a key as he walks to the covered portico
elanora chu is an attractive woman with warmth and intelligence in her eyes
she is in a wheelchair at a writing table where she carefully translates an english text into chinese characters
she glances up as catch opens the front door and heads for the kitchen speaking as he goes not looking at her or into the living room at all
i got you nectarines because the peaches are hard as rocks
your jackets all dirty
she rolls away from the table in her motorized chair and as they speak across the house she performs a ritual
i tackled a guy
elanora is moving about the living room picking up framed photographs and turning them face down
we dont see what or who is in these photos
she is turning them all in a routine way used to this
why would you tackle a guy
why do you think
catch is at the cupboards putting away groceries as elanora rolls into the kitchen her chair humming
he had the ball
he was going for a touchdown
can you be serious
as he works what day is today
they are not smiling at their little jokes but they have an ease with each other and the deep love of dear friends
he doesnt pause in his work but we can see some nervousness in him as he says
met somebody today
chu is now taking some of the groceries out of the bags to help
ahh they had the broccolini today
elanora is more interested and curious now still helping with the groceries and being casual
you didnt tackle her too did you
shes a police officer
stops worried are you in trouble
catch goes on working a depth in his eyes
elanora watches him work and gladdens slightly
we see her own depth of feeling
thats a good thing
he is still working but his eyes are on his thoughts his struggle
i saw her once a long time ago
elanora stares a moment
this has meaning for her
he doesnt answer
hes nervous about this
she looks the same
now she watches him as he moves to the refrigerator and continues his work in silence
its a noisy restaurant with a large bar area
we pan to a booth of off duty cops out of uniform now including ray sanchez sharon and a few more male officers
theyre all a bit high
sharon shows the signs too
they are passing around a photo now as one cop looks at it and says
and sanchez says proudly
my wifes got him in agility class
ray is handed the photo and we see that theyre talking about sanchezs dog the name rex printed on the photo
rex is good
i wonder who the first person was to name a dog fido and what the hell does it mean
i like how youre always asking the big questions ray
there is some laughter
ray is a smart ass and a flirt
i got a big question for you pogo but i can only ask it when were alone
she moves some of the change on the table sliding it toward ray
here use this call your wife and ask her instead
i happen to know rays wife is busy tonight
they laugh and drink and ray asks her
why doesnt your partner ever come out with us
robbys a family man
im a family man
yeah but his family actually likes him
sharons eyes do a quick roam of the bar
ray catches this
that lambert i guess hes not showing either
she shrugs this off like its not important and starts to slide out of the booth
where are you going
do you mind
shes just gonna freshen up her makeup
youre wearing makeup
she leaves the booth with a wry frown
that reminds me ray
you still have that eye liner you borrowed from me
she grins leaving the laughter behind her
catch has entered the bar
he is watching sharon leave the booth and walk to the rest rooms
he looks back at the raucous booth and hesitates
he sits at a small table near the door
sharon is drying her hands in the bars bathroom staring into the mirror
no smile now
we see into her mind for a second
pointing the gun at her face today
in the mirror and see how shaken she still is
a waitress is leaving his table and he looks back at sharons booth and sees that she still isnt there
he starts to turn and then freezes as he hears
there you are
she has stepped out of the bathroom and spotted him
he is surprised face to face now
we thought you wouldnt show
why you sitting here
i dont talk to a lot of people
he half rises and gestures to the other chair
she glances back at her booth then sits
shes nervous too
i didnt have a chance to thank you
im sharon pogue
she puts out her hand
he stares at that hand for just half a beat before taking it
the feel of her hand holding his evokes the memory of the accident but he covers this
you look familiar
i guess i live on the beat you patrol
her way to cover nervousness is to be blunt even tough
why would you do that jump a man with a gun
shrugs he was going to shoot you
he couldve shot you
you have a death wish
you a bungee jumper
i didnt have time to think about it
what dyou think about it now
it was worth the risk
for someone you dont even know
yeah and for what you do
i think cops are great
out there trying to keep it safe
firemen are everybodys heroes
kids wave at firemen
people should wave at cops
did you ever think about how many people are walking around this town because you saved them
i never thought about it
because you helped them or because you arrested somebody who wouldve hurt them or because you just
did your job
now im walking around this town because of you
ever think about that
maybe you should be a cop
i dont know
i look pretty dumb in a hat
he has made her smile
and i dont drive and like i said i dont talk to many people
am i talking too much
you go ahead
what dyou do
you employed around here
every time i try to talk to somebody it comes out like an interrogation
where do you want to be ten years from now
somebody taught that to me
kind of a shortcut
you ask somebody what are your plans for tomorrow whatre your dreams for ten years from now
its supposed to get things started
does it work
i never tried it
i just remembered it god is my witness
not in here
its mostly cops
now she has made him smile the first real smile weve seen from catch
its open and real and she is charmed by it
you have a nice smile
shes a bit self conscious saying that and just as she says it the waitress arrives with shots and beers for both of them
sharon looks up questioning and the waitress nods toward the booth
catch and sharon see the cops staring smiling raising their glasses
there is a hint of teasing in their grins
and now sharon is more self conscious and a bit tough again taking her drink and turning back to catch
what were we talking about
oh yeah you were giving me some line about starting a conversation
they clink glasses and drink
tomorrow ive got a night watch shift
if the weather clears in the morning ill go hiking
if it rains ill go to the gym and the laundromat
ten years from now
i want to be living in some mountainous place
could be tibet
could be colorado
but now ray juliette is approaching the table
hey pogo dont keep him all to yourself
come on over lambert join the group
well buy you dinner give you a medal for saving pogos ass
sharon drains her shot and stands
actually im kind of tired ray
im taking off
walk you to your car
catch stands and turns to ray
thanks for the drink
least we could do
we dont like her very much but we dont want to lose her
sharon frowns and waves to the booth of cops
ray smiles and shakes hands with catch as a good bye
and catch and sharon leave
as catch and sharon exit the building walk toward her car
its not a great neighborhood
maybe i should walk you to your car
i dont have a car
they walk on silent a moment
this doesnt come easy for her
want a ride home
oh thanks but
i like to walk
its starting to rain
dont be a hero
he hesitates nervous about it but then
if its no trouble
they walk to her car
ten years from now what dyou want to be doing
they walk side by side a moment
then in his open way
i dont know
this is pretty good
she glances at him taking this in then fumbles a bit with her car keys and he asks nervously again
can you drive okay
she gets a little defensive
im not drunk
you think im drunk
youll know im drunk when im throwing up and i never throw up so dont worry about it
he nods looks at her dead on a moment
the only time i worry is when people tell me not to worry
get in the car will you
as they get in and she starts the engine
im on lundy street just off pico
they drive a while
she notices his anxiety
he grips the armrest when she speeds up
im good at this
streets are wet
are you one of those people who drive ten miles an hour in the rain
i hate that
i never drive
she glances at him and he notices her glance
ill be alright
hes forcing himself to relax
he takes a deep breath sitting back in his seat
he watches her as she drives
after a moment
yknow i can picture you in colorado
what am i doing there
she smiles in spite of herself slows down
im not pissed off at you
give me some time
now she laughs
she drives not to his building but to her own street
she parks takes a deep breath
this sounds a bit hard bitten because shes using her toughness to cover
those guys in the bar are my friends sort of
we work together we tell jokes and we bullshit but i cant say to them
she says this clipped and fast and even tougher every time i close my eyes i see that goddamn gun pointing at me and i dont know why im telling
you unless its because you were there and because i had three drinks but im not ready to go inside and close my eyes and i dont want to go to your place and i dont want to keep driving around so what the hell do we do
i feel like were boxing and youve got me on the ropes
pause well do whatever you want
what i want is to know how you happened to be walking by that parking lot at that minute
what if you hadn t been there
for a moment she shows her fear
i guess we were supposed to meet
they stare a while then she opens her door
if you want you can come in for a minute
as they walk in she moves into the kitchen
want a drink
she pours one for herself while he looks about
its a stiff drink
now that hes here her i dont want to make a fool of myself alarm is on
she flops on the sofa watches him
sit down or something
im circling awhile
hes looking around at the clutter of her life the intimate details
youre not supposed to look around
i didnt have time to straighten up
its more real this way
he turns to her
now that im in here you seem mad about it
im not mad
youll know when im mad
i dont usually let somebody in here but here you are
lets talk about something stupid
she smiles in spite of herself
okay one thing i dont believe is that supposed to business
we were supposed to meet
that sounds a little fringy to me like something you might hear on public access tv
you believe that
some people say we each give off a particular odor that can only be detected by one other persons brain
smell each other
who says that
i have no idea
as they smile im more in the destiny school we met in another life school
do you believe that
do you think when we die we come back in another form
you mean like a duck
i think dead is dead
ive been thinking about it all day and i dont want to think about it anymore
he looks at her steps close to her takes the drink out of her hand puts it to his lips and drinks it all down
he puts the glass on the table
whyd you do that
now youre thinking about me
she gets a half smile assessing him
her look is direct and the attraction is there
he feels it too and he deflects it nodding toward a large photomural of snowcapped mountains
let me guess
its austria but i cant picture myself in austria
im not good with languages so i couldnt qualify for the departments over there
she rises and goes to a desk and takes the holstered gun off her ankle
she takes the cuffs off her belt the mace from her jacket the shield from her shirt pocket puts them all in a desk drawer
she takes off her jacket and throws it over a chair
disarmed she turns to him
her look is all wanting and pushing away almost fierce in her struggle
he sees this
coming up here
does that mean im going
you dont have to
you okay now
her eyes grow a bit hard defensive
youre here as a medic
is this the mad part
she smiles in spite of herself again
he has gotten to her
she wants to fall into this guy but shes pumping those brakes
they are standing close together
maybe going is a good idea
can i come back some time
shrugs must be the smell
that makes her laugh and her resistance falls away with her surprised laughter and she puts her hands around the back of his neck
her touch is electric to him
she is going in for a kiss and he is retreating
they stare a moment and then he suddenly takes her shoulders and lets loose his own longing
it is a hungry and passionate kiss and in the very midst of it he breaks off and pulls back his darkness rushing at him
she is staring surprised and he is looking a bit shaken getting the words out just above a whisper
i better go
she doesnt know what to say
the moment hangs
once he closes the door the breath escapes her and she shakes her head feeling like an idiot
she lost control
with a stranger
catch leaving sharons building in a turmoil of emotions staring hard at his thoughts and he steps into the path of a car
the car screeches to a stop and the scream of those brakes and white light of the head lamps paralyze catch and he sees
headlights suddenly washing into a vehicle he is driving
this sliver of memory jolts him and then another one comes
coming closer and the scream of brakes from his memory and all of this is exploded by the angry driver shouting at him
what the hell do you think youre doing
catch is numb completely shut down there in the middle of the street
the driver exits his car and comes toward him raging
are you crazy
catch isnt even aware of him
the man gawks at this and now catch walks off
it is raining
the streets are wet
as catch continues his walk he is still a bit shaken but when he passes a parked car with the window half open rain getting in he hesitates
he cant just walk on
he looks about
he tests the lock
he opens the door rolls up the window closes the door walks on
but a man is just exiting a doorway to the street and calls out
what did you do
catch stops and turns in the rain
the man hurries toward him upset angry
thats my car
what the hell were you doing
the man shoves him
i saw you
what did you take out of there
no i rolled up the window
the man gets in his face shaky
you take my phone
he shoves catch again and catchs desperate confusion explodes in a surprising reaction grabbing the mans jacket front in one hand and not punching him but quickly slap slap slapping
the man is now speechless frozen terrified as catchs eyes hold him with a fierceness and a sadness
i helped you
pause i helped you
catch lets him go and immediately begins walking away hunching into the rain his expression dark and troubled
he gets five steps away and turns
the man steps back but catch only says
and he walks on
the man watches him go
candace catchs neighbor is waiting for the slow rattling elevator with her son
the elevator door opens and there is catch seated on a newly bought wicker chair in the elevator with a small table across his lap other boxes nearby and a
long stemmed rose in his hand wrapped for giving
he rises and hurriedly gets his purchases off the elevator so the woman and little boy can enter
he smiles at her a bit less subdued than before as he gets his things into the hall and he manages a special look for tommy a wink
he frees the elevator they step inside
as the door starts to close catchs face follows the sliding door with a funny look for the boy
we hear tommy laugh as the door closes
catch carries his new possessions to his apartment
a well kept older home well planted pretty
a woman of nearly is tending the flowers
she hears someone approaching the gate in the wooden fence
she looks up
sharon is at the gate in uniform on her dinner break
the older woman is her mother elaine pogue
there is an old strain between them a sadness and a nervousness in elaine
shes a quiet woman
she smiles at her daughter as sharon comes through the gate
they hug tentatively a lot of baggage here
sharon turns to the garden
its looking great mom
pleased thanks honey
its the best year ever for the impatiens
the very best
there is a beat of awkward silence
lets go in
as they enter
its a bit dark inside older furniture lots of keepsake clutter and photos
sharon is restless in here bad memories
looks the same
still smells like cigarettes
i thought he quit
hes down to six a day
your hair looks nice
her mother touches her hair self consciously
she cant help glancing at her daughter in all that gear bullet proof vest under her shirt radio cuffs and that gun
are you well
sharon steps close to the mantel
there is a photo of her there graduating from the police academy a professional not a family shot
she is surprised
i guess im well
is this always here
its always there
did larry tell you i came by where hes working
is that why you called me
i called because we want to invite you to our renewal of vows
its three weeks from saturday
you said we want to invite you
sharon takes that in still looking about
how come youre renewing your vows
its sort of
a fresh start
both of us
its a way of
having the marriage blessed
wasnt it blessed before
her mother sighs sad for all the trouble between them
of course it was blessed
i just what mom
you just think about the bad and you never remember the good
i wish you remembered the good
sharon stares deeply at her
i wish i did too
then almost like a child does he
remember any good about me
he doesnt hate you
still feels hurt
i hurt him
being arrested like that
somebody doesnt forget that
how come you forgot what he did
it wasnt as bad you always make it sound worse
and it hasnt been that way for years
im glad it hasnt been that way
that means it worked mom
that was the point
thats why i did it
why do i get punished for it
honey nobodys punishing you
were inviting you
will you come
of course ill come
we didnt think youd want to
now her mother shows a trace of fear
she says gently
we dont want any trouble
on that day
mom im your daughter
i dont want any trouble ever
ill come to the ceremony
i wont come to argue and i wont come in uniform
they each get a small sad smile
its on the rd
id like you to send me an invitation
vander said its a beautiful invitation
her mother starts to leave the room
ill show you
id like to get one
in the mail
from my family
sharon goes to the door then stops and turns letting her guard down all the way to say
and she leaves
sharon is climbing the outdoor staircase to her apartment tired after her shift drained a bit by her visit home
when she reaches her door she sees that a long stemmed rose has been masking taped to her door
written on the masking tape is catch lambert and a phone number
she pauses staring at this gets a little grin
sharon is dressed for bed in a sleep shirt lying on the bed surrounded by old photos and a couple of photo albums from her girlhood
in a vase on her bed table is catchs rose
sharon is feeling blue looking at her young self within the family that has shut her out
she closes the book angry at herself for nearly crying
she sits up and catches sight of the rose and rummages in the drawer and pulls out the tape with catchs phone number on it
shes very conflicted about this
she puts the tape down but it sticks to her fingers
she tears it off and tries to throw it onto the table but it hangsoff her thumb
she sighs and steels herself and dialsthe number
he has bought a shelf unit that needs some assembly and hes at work with a screwdriver his new chair and table nearby the phone on the floor
phone rings and he picks it up
as we intercut the call do you have a machine
do you have an answering machine
will you hang up please and ill call your machine
she hangs up
he stares at the phone a moment bewildered
he hangs up and his phone rings
he lets it ring
his machine comes on with no recording only a hi
maybe we can
have breakfast or something
i get up early and run in ballard park
theres a dennys across from the park
like eight or so
if youre there youre there
she hangs up sighs a heavy one
and she falls back on her bed
catch walks in glances at the clock
hes nervous and excited
he takes a seat where he can watch the park the runners
she has tossed and turned all night
she is awake turning to look at her clock radio
she raises a hand over it
it changes to and the radio comes on
she slams her hand down on it cutting it off
she lays back and heaves a sigh that becomes a moan sits up again and picks up the phone dials the number on the tape
hi dont pick up
look i didnt sleep much and anyway this is a bad idea
i was feeling funky last night and im all right now so lets just leave it where its at
oh thanks for the
she hangs up and lays back down and pounds her head into the pillow and covers herself even her head with the sheet
catch is waiting watching out the window
its until we
and now its and catch is still waiting and watching
she is still in bed under the sheet
someone begins knocking on her door and she sits up bleary and frustrated
she stumbles out of the bedroom to her door
she opens the door
he wears a stern look
she is not apologetic
i was just falling asleep
we made a date
it wasnt a date
okay an appointment
i keep my appointments
she gives an exasperated moan and turns to stagger back to bed
he closes the door and follows
i called you
i called you at seven
i get up early
i walked there
i waited there
check your messages
she heads for the bed passing a mirror looking at her rumpled self and groaning at the sight
she climbs into bed and snuggles there and puts the sheet over her head
he is entering the bedroom
he carries a dennys take out bag
under the sheet i need more sleep
come back in a month
what makes you think id come back here
the lump under the sheet says
then why are you here
im here to tell you that when you tell someone youre going to be somewhere then that someone rearranges his life and you should be more aware of that and
a lot more considerate instead of just
she has come out from under the sheet and is watching him
whats in the bag
none of your business
did you bring some coffee
you think you deserve coffee
what else did you bring
opening the bag you definitely dont deserve food
ive got coffee sugar sweetener non dairy
she sits up
he hands her the coffee
she sips relishing the sip then studies him
so what kind of life did you rearrange in order to get to dennys
you never said one word about yourself last night
what dyou do
whats the difference
whats the difference
youre standing in my bedroom
thats the difference
who are you
somebody who keeps appointments
then a thought oh shit youre married right
convinced she picks up one of the throw pillows from the bed and tosses it at him
i dont believe you
you dont believe me
give me back the coffee
give me the coffee
she hands him the coffee
he hits her with the pillow and hands her back the coffee
he has made her smile but she continues half teasing now
oh wait youre involved in some criminal activity arent you
great thats all i need
my name is catch lambert
i dont work
i dont commit any crimes
i like being with you
we can start from here from now
i let you in here
im not going to be some fool
i need the details
and i need to start from here
thats the way it is
i dont really want to know you anyway
he is conflicted but he wont relent
he walks to the door
she stares waiting
but he never turns around
he walks out
she is mystified exasperated
she hears her front door close
she puts the coffee on her bed table and finds herself staring at that damn rose
she suddenly gets up and begins to dress hurriedly with a plan
sharon is driving speeding a bit getting to catchs building ahead of him
he approaches his apartment building unlocks the front door walks in the entrance area
now we see across the street sharon exit her car and follow him
the front door has locked automatically
outside there is a panel of buzzers and apartment numbers
sharon hits all the buttons
somebody buzzes her in
sharon enters looks at the elevators
its not moving
she goes to the stairs listens hears him trudging up the stairway
she follows silently
as catch reaches his apartment door unlocks it opens it and walks in
before he can close the door behind him it bangs open wider startling him and sharon is in the doorway staring hard at him
sarcastic can i come in
she walks in and closes the door and starts looking around as he says
despite his recent decorating the apartment is still nearly empty
no books magazines photographs no clutter of life
she glances into the equally sterile kitchen
you live here
nobody lives here
this place is some kind of front a scam a drop or what
this is what you told me about right
do i need a lawyer
he has made her look at herself and take a breath
i just dont want to be jerked around
then tell me straight out
who are you
he is silent and she starts to leave
moment of truth
what is it youre looking for
i dont want any surprises
this is it
i sleep here
i walk around town
thats all of it
thats all of it
except for you the way i feel about you
i thought it was impossible
i thought i was
you thought you were what
in a way
im supposed to understand that
did you ever wonder what scratch meant when people say well start from scratch
this is scratch
we can start from here
she looks at him looks at his empty place his non life and back at him again
i dont know
i just dont know
she breaks off the stare and heads for the door
he watches her go
as catch charges up the stairs to the wide porch of mrs
chus well kept home carrying a grocery bag head full of his thoughts
as catch enters
she is watching tv
he does glance into the living room briefly to throw her a quick hello smile before moving to the kitchen
she snaps off the tv and begins turning the photos face down as she sends her voice to the kitchen
i remember that
that was a smile
he is putting groceries away as she rolls into the room
he doesnt look at her tries to be casual but his thoughts are bubbling out
you know the cop the woman cop
chu registers surprise at this but keeps it covered and casual
where did she sit
i have a chair now
he darkens a bit as he works
she has a lot of questions
she wants to know everything
of course she does
we could start from today
whats so wrong with that
the can in catchs hand bangs on the cupboard and he stops suddenly uptight
tell her what
chu comes closer
tell her catch
its been almost two years
a warning nora
every time i tell somebody it gets a little bit easier
im not saying it goes
his next warning is tough and absolute
she is silenced
the moment hangs
she rolls her chair to him takes a box of cookies out of his hand opens the box and eats one defusing the moment
he starts to work again
that doesnt matter
smiles she is pretty
shes sort of pissed off at me
it doesnt matter
we like it when men apologize
he stares at her a while
im sorry i yelled at you
she smiles and hands him the box
have a cookie
sharon is typing at the computer dark and dogged in her work
lieutenant sanderman is watching her through the glass wall of the watch commanders office
he comes out of the office and moves to where sharon is typing
we can see the computer screen now
sharon is searching for any prior record of catch lambert arrests convictions
she has several carl lamberts on the screen even a casper no catch
anything bothering you
whatd i do
im talking about your general attitude lately
sharon stops typing
she can find nothing
she clears the screen sighs
my attitudes fine
end of a long day
family matters getting to you
your brother larry
what about larry
you know nester on the culver city p
he went out on a violent domestic dispute yesterday
a neighbor called it in
it got a little ugly
no arrest a warning
this hits her hard
nester said its not the first time
sharon is quiet a while taking it in shaken by it
thanks for telling me
sharon not in uniform is approaching larrys house
it has a small yard with kids toys strewn about and a tire swing
she walks up on the porch and rings the doorbell
she hears voices inside larry and kathy a quick murmuring low voice argument cant make out the words
in a moment larry opens the door
jesus youre up early
i wanted to catch you before you went to work
i thought you were on late shifts
i dont sleep much
can i come in
the place is messy
a tv can be heard cartoons
shes busy with larry jr
sharon nods but then walks past him
as sharon walks into this toy strewn room
is sitting on the floor watching a small tv
kathy is not with him
sharon kneels beside the boy a moment
but he stays focused on the tv some darkness some unsayable worry in his eyes
she picks up a toy car speaks softly
yknow they call this one a woody cause it has wood on the sides
now he looks at her with sad and bottomless eyes
she is hurting for him
larry is now in the doorway
sharon kisses the childs head and walks out passing her brother
whyd you come by
to see kathy
as sharon heads for the master bedroom larry takes her arm
shes not feeling good
sharon pulls away from her brother
ill just say hello
sharon walks in
kathy is sitting on the bed her face badly bruised
kathy speaks quietly her eyes filling
dont make it worse
it gets worse
hes okay now
hes torn up about it
dont make him mad
sharon moves closer
she reaches out touches kathy with a comforting touch as the woman turns her bruised face away
when larry and i were growing up our mother said that all the time
dont make your father mad
pause has he hit larry jr
he never would
just you huh
larry is in the doorway now angry
what dyou think youre doing in my house shar
in my home
she walks out of the room and he follows her
she turns on him
you see a pattern here bro
i lost my temper
things got out of hand
people always say that ive got a temper
like its an excuse
i dont need a goddamn lecture
she comes very close to him
you want to hit someone
next time your temper flares up lar and you just have to hit somebody you go home and hit your father
you blame everything on him
im blaming you you fucking coward
he grabs her shirt hard
you dont come in here
he pushes her into the wall
you dont come in here and call me names
what do you call a man who uses his wife as a punching bag
he swings a slap at her
she blocks it and punches him hard in the face and he crashes down on the floor
kathy comes running calling out
dont hurt her lar
kathy sees that its larry on his ass
the little boy comes out of his room
there is a surprised moment
then kathy picks up the child and takes him back to his room
larry is sitting up shaken his nose bleeding
sharon goes close to him rigid with fury
i know how it feels cause i remember
i remember standing between you and dad and taking the blows for you and for what
you turned out to be just like him you bastard
pause and so did i
and she leaves the house and slams the door
she is just returning home after her shift very tired drained
she absently turns on the tv the stereo
she notices a blinking light on her message machine and hits the button
i bet you feel real proud of yourself shar knocking me down in front of my family
you know what ive got in my hand
ive got a polaroid picture of my busted up face and im thinking of sending it to your department to your lieutenant
im going to turn you in to the police shar and see how you like it
the message ends
she stands there a moment
quietly oh god
she sits on the edge of a chair worried deep in her thoughts hitting bottom the darkness engulfing her
in a moment she looks at her desk walks there opens a drawer pulls out that piece of tape with catchs number on it but it is all stuck to
she hesitates then starts to pick it apart when a knock at the door makes her jump
she wonders then somehow she knows
she walks to the door
its you right
she unlocks and opens the door stares at catch very vulnerable on the very edge her pain and fear over larry just under the surface
catch holds a box of cookies as an offering
can you just shut up
just shut up and listen
i didnt say anything
i dont want to talk
i dont care if you have to play some game and pretend youre a
angel of mercy or
i dont care but i dont want to hear about it
i dont want to hear anything
she steps back allowing him in and closes the door and turns to him
its a bad night
he sees her pain and puts his arms around her pushes through his fear and holds her and she lays her head on his chest
he embraces her fully and the effect on him goes deep to his core where there is both pain and longing but he holds on to her even rocks her
in a moment
this is good
but im too tired to stand up anymore
he walks her to the couch and has her sit and then slowly gently he disarms her
he lifts her leg takes the ankle holster and gun off puts it on the table
he turns her takes the cuffs off her belt from the middle of her back
he reaches into her pants pocket and removes the mace
from her shirt pocket he takes her i
he has her lie down on the couch now their faces close eyes locked
you want to kiss me
he looks a little lost but he nods helpless
he comes toward her lips finally but just before they touch she says softly
kiss me someplace ive never been kissed
hes not sure what to do
he begins to look her over as if hunting and she gets a soft smile
he starts slowly toward her ear but she shakes her head
her shirt is out of her belt and her midriff bare and he starts to move there but checks her with a look
she shakes her head
her smile deepens a bit
he takes her hand and turns it over going for the soft flesh on the underside of her forearm and she closes her eyes
he kisses her there softly and then again and then he lavishes kisses from her wrist to the underside of her elbow as she sighs with pleasure and draws up
her knees in a kind of sensual glow that is leading them to
she looks at him a deep look soft voice
why do you stop
you always stop
she has a glimpse of his mystery the old sorrow the deep pain
he hugs her drawn up knees closing his eyes a moment
then he sits on the couch puts a pillow on his lap and raises her slightly lays her head on the pillow
he strokes her hair her scalp as she closes her eyes and sighs slowly moving toward sleep
our trumpet music slides in here lush and dreamy as we linger a while and then just after dawn
catch has slept on the couch
he is beginning to awaken now as the first light strikes the windows
the dreamy trumpet fades out
catchs eyes clear sleep replaced by thought and he is suddenly shaken by a sliver of memory
but in this one he is driving
we see his hands on the wheel
then his pov looks to the side and we see an asian american woman seated beside him attractive about his age
her name is annie
she is saying something to him
we dont hear the words
when the flashback ends
catch sits up on the couch jolted
he gets another sudden glaring through his windshield blinding him
he gasps sitting there on the couch but its all over
he stands rattled and he moves toward sharons bedroom
sharon is peacefully asleep
he stands over her with troubled eyes but this slowly changes to a loving look
he bends close to her face
he feels her breath on him
he wants to lie down with her but he raises a hand and very gently brushes her cheek
he does it again
she sighs a peaceful sigh opens her eyes
he smiles at her
sharon is driving catch home
they are now on a main boulevard of stores office buildings
they stop at a light
both are surprised by a voice calling out from the pedestrians crossing the street
they look up to see a well dressed man pausing in the middle of the crosswalk to face their car
he is in his forties tall with grey blond hair
this is richard pindella
he has a small smile and wave for catch
sharon is curious looking at catch
catch throws the man a dark look and then turns away ignoring him nervous intense
to sharon drive will you
pindella is moving toward the car sharon watching him wondering
the light changes
pindella hurries to the curb as the cars surge forward
sharon drives slowly checking the mirror to see pindella stare after them then enter the office building on the corner
will you get off this street
she makes a turn glancing at catch
you owe him money
but his dark look persists and he doesnt answer
if you take a right and stop we can walk from here
id rather walk
he is nervous being in the car and glad to leave it when she pulls over
she watches this wondering
sharon exits the car and locks it staring at catch
if youre in trouble
if youre in trouble with him maybe i can help
forget about him
somebody i used to know
i dont want to know him anymore
forget about it
walk with me
she hesitates then falls in beside him as he walks on
they walk along in silence the neighborhood growing more seedy tougher as they go
catch is relaxing now trying to push it all away
sharon looks around her
this is not a great place to walk
i like it here
i work here
its not fine
whats the problem
besides the shootings break ins rapes cart thefts
weve got a loose dog raiding garbage cans knocking em over
cant catch him
got somebody blowing a trumpet between midnight and three
cant find him
as someone approaches them catch makes eye contact and smiles a small friendly smile in passing
he gets a brief smile in return
he and sharon amble on
he does it again
you know everybody here
he nods to another young man hes never met
hows it goin
goin uphill man
catch and sharon smile
to sharon you try it
we need this
she has misgivings
a young woman is bustling along
sharon makes eye contact and presents a nervous smile and a nod but the woman looks at her sternly and bustles on
i feel like a jerk
i feel like a smiley face
catch smiles sharon frowns but when an old man passes she gives a small smile
the man lights up
catch looks at her
she tries to shrug it off but cant quite hide her pleasure
now catch is pausing as a woman is walking her six year old daughter to their parked car
catch makes eye contact with the girl and does a goofy wave that makes her smile
sharon smiles too
as the girls mother is unlocking the car the girl shyly looks back at catch for more fun
he does that quick finger trick trying to catch his own thumb and the girl giggles but the mother is impatient
the girl gets in
the mother is about to close the door
she frowns mean eyed
move your arm
the girl slides in further and the mother slams the door
the girl follows her mother with hurt eyes as she walks around to the drivers side
catch has paused to watch this his eyes gentle on the girl
the mother is about to enter the car when she sees catch staring
what are you staring at
she feels bad cause you yelled at her
who the hell do you think you are
sharon is uncomfortable
catch persists never flinching at the womans anger
she just needs you to smile at her
its none of your business
why not smile at her
whats it cost
who the hell are you to talk to me
catchs anger is like flint in his eyes
it surprises sharon
shes upset by this
youre so damn impatient
get away from me
youre so busy being pissed off and time is going by
its not her fault
the woman gets into the car and slams the door
im calling the police
im calling the police
turns to sharon hey police
the woman speeds her car away
sharon gets in catchs face
jesus christ catch
maybe shell think about it now
you had no right to do that
you think you know everything
who the hell are you some expert on raising kids
the neighborhood angel
no i just
some people are walking around blind
thats not your problem
dont tell me what my problem is
okay fine you tell me what it is
maybe its not my problem
maybe its your problem
maybe youre going around blind
blind to what
blind to whats going on around you
blind to what people need
were supposed to take care of each other
were supposed to keep each other safe
thats the way it should be if youre not going around blind like that woman
or like me right
what about you
how come you can see
that stops him the darkness rising
he looks about trying to contain it
i think ill
walk the rest of the way on my own
ill call you later about the hiking
ill be out
she turns and walks away
he is still angry but sorry to see her go
but she keeps walking and he watches her walk away
then he walks on upset mad at himself trying to pound through it walking quickly
he is passing an alley when he hears a crash
he looks in
he sees a large dog that has just knocked over a garbage can
he and the dog stare
catch walks into the alley approaches the big dog squats down to look the animal in the eye and begins petting it
the big mutt is now leaning into the petting and catchs eyes go deep and slowly find their way to a sad smile
sharon and robby are patrolling in their unit
robby is driving
sharon is watching out the window with a deep eyed look a bit down because of her argument with catch
she is staring as she rolls along
she is watching the people on the street noticing for once just how isolated they are each in a box passing without connecting
weve never seen the apartment flooded by sunlight like this all blinds open
we start in the kitchen staring at the drawer that is now so loaded with toys it wont shut
some brightly painted soldiers are sticking out of the drawer
in the living room there are two chairs now and more lamps and tables
our pan reveals that the dog from the alley is sitting in the living room watching catch whom we now see is hanging a picture on the wall a mountain
he holds the picture in one place then moves it to another wondering
his fight with sharon still colors his mood but hes working through it
do we go for
more off center
he glances at the dog as he moves the picture
are you into this
the dog watches him
it is early evening of the same day and sharon is just off shift out of uniform in her own car parking on larrys street and walking to the door
she knocks and takes a step back
larry opens the door already angry his nose bandaged eyes blackened a bit from the blow
i dont want you around here
lets go talk in the yard
she starts walking back into his darkening front yard looking over her shoulder
she walks to a tree where the tire swing hangs waits there
he goes back inside but leaves the door open
in a moment he reappears coming outside closing the door behind him
as they meet by the tire swing
his eyes burn her hate and pain
you took a swing at me
you asked for it calling me a coward
you knew id swing
you think i look bad now
look at this
he has a polaroid photo in his hand holds it in front of her dried blood and bad bruising on his face
the copsll love this right
dont you guys love evidence
he puts it in his pocket and they stare a moment more
you wanted me to swing
she looks away
she nods speaks softly
im sorry i hit you so hard
but youre not sorry you hit me
jesus larry what about kathys face
thats not your business
nobody called you right
she didnt ask for you to come here
this is my family
you dont get it cause youve got no family
so you try to run everybody elses life
jesus christ get your own life
thats the goddam problem
get your own goddamn life
their stare holds but she is giving way
im sorry i came here
im sorry i hit you
this is very hard for her
dont go to my department all right
why the hell not
because the jobs all i got
thats what i said right
she nods her voice smaller almost a whisper
thats what you said
he makes her wait thinking it over
and you wont come around here
you wont call
in a moment sharon nods
and i dont want you to come to mom and dads celebration
her eyes snap to his surprised
not the church
not the party
i dont want you around
i dont want to see you shar
after another moment she nods again and he snatches the photo out of his shirt pocket and pushes it against her chest and walks away
the photo falls to the ground
larry says without turning
go get a life
and she snaps
i got a life
the words burst out of her thick with tears but shes not crying
larry stops and turns
how the hell would you know about my life
you know nothing about me because you dont want to know
the family doesnt want to know me
well too bad
sharons got a life
sharons got a boyfriend
sharons going hiking in the morning with her boyfriend
shes not sitting alone miserable like you want
she reaches down snatches the polaroid photo off the ground walks to her car enters and slams the door as hard as it is possible to slam it
moving through the panorama are two small figures on a hiking trail traveling uphill on a ridge
sharon is pounding along barely out of breath
she studies the beautiful view and it helps her
it lifts her
catch is falling behind breathing heavily
can you wait up a minute
he catches up
i thought you walked all over the city
gasping the city is flat
can we stop here
can we examine the view
have a milky way
ive burned every calorie i ever had
but she walks on
my favorite lunch spot is another half mile
she smiles and walks on and he follows calling out
im not one of those competitive guys you know
sharon is already unpacking their lunch as catch trudges up and collapses near a stream fed pond
she hands him a sandwich but he shakes his head
i cant eat and have a heart attack at the same time
she smiles again and takes a bite and stares off and soon enough her dark thoughts come and cover her and catch notices
as soon as you get happy you get sad
everythings code four
this isnt fine
i know fine
this is something else
something happened yesterday
yesterday you mean you want to hear about it
sure i do
you never talk about yesterday
all my days are the same
he keeps staring waiting
she is chewing a sandwich looking at him
finally she begins with no emotion
yesterday we rolled on a
juliette and sanchez had these four guys against a wall but they were h
and definitely unco op
it got pretty jumpy but we got them in the car with a couple of bruises and robby got a sprained wrist so i did the rest of the shift
with a rookie who lost it over a d
in sunset park old woman whod been dead maybe six seven days and i usually do all right but the smell got to me and i can still smell her
then we arrested a prostitute working out of her home and i carried her little girl out to the social worker and the kid was holding on real tight and
making my shoulder wet and i wanted to punch her rock head mother and then shift ended and i had a nice visit with my brother larry
he is staring at her
he takes her hands holds them
softly im sorry
that would make anybody sad
sorry you asked
no you can always tell me
she stares a moment then speaks with an irony he doesnt pick up on
i feel better now
you feel better
i feel fine
he takes off his t shirt and begins stripping off his shorts his underwear
what are you doing
she is surprised smiling as he plunges into the pond her darkness dissipating
theres no swimming here
and you cant be naked in a state park
he dives under and surfaces again
take the day off pogo
what if a park ranger comes
he dives and surfaces once more
we stay close on him
take your badge off for once
dont be such a damn marine about everything
he stops because she isnt there
he looks about
then suddenly he sees her poised on a boulder right above him in her underwear about to dive
he yelps and gets out of her way and she dives off the rock in classic near professional form a beautiful sleek dive
she hits the water just right and surfaces and they splash and swim and frolic and dunk each other in unabashed play
at one point she jumps at him to dunk him and he catches her
they are in chest deep water and their faces are close
they pause then she goes in for a kiss but he pulls his head back avoiding that kiss and says
someplace ive never been kissed
she smiles staring then slowly reaches her hands to his face gently closes his eyes and is about to kiss him on the closed lids but she changes her mind
and instead puts her lips tenderly on each of the small scars on his face
then she moves away
he opens his eyes
she walks to the shore moves to her clothes and starts getting dried and dressed giving him a soft look
catch comes to the shore to dry himself but as he dresses sharon glances at his body and the scarring on his chest and arms
he is troubled about this avoiding her eyes
then he makes a decision
they tell me i was in an accident
long time ago
looks like a bad one
i dont remember it
she waits but he says no more
she continues to dress sliding her shorts over her wet underwear but before she puts her shirt on she turns her back to take off her wet bra
he glances at her
she looks over and catches him glancing
they both smile softly ironically as they finish dressing
we should be thinking about lunch
we have to pack up
some of us have to work
teasing you ever work
you remember that
she smiles and walks off toward the food
he stares after her his smile fading into thoughtfulness memory as he dresses
catch is standing outside looking in through the large window searching
his eyes settle on a man and he stares
the man about his age is having coffee and reading the paper
catch is staring deeply mustering his courage
he walks into the place
catch hesitates then walks over and stands beside this man until he jack molina looks up
jack beams with recognition and surprise
catch is held back smiling a bit but on thin ice here dipping into his past
how are you
you been out of town
sitting ive been around
jacks smile clouds as memory kicks in
oh man im really sorry about what happened
i never got a chance to say
catch with a steady look says
we dont need to go there
jack nods a moment
what dyou want a coffee
i want my old job back
pause what dyou think
you been workin
no but im up to speed
thinks well its not good with randal anymore
no hes out of it but danny coleys got something going

catch stares nods
finish your coffee
in a seedy parking lot tough part of town robby and sharon are arresting two teenage girls
one of them is leaning on the car as sharon searches her
robby stands back with the other cuffed girl
robby is staring at sharon through this moment noting the difference in her still very professional but softer
the girl is upset near tears
sharon is gentle in her search
i have to check these jacket pockets
whats your name allison
the girl nods not trusting her voice
i need to unsnap this allison
im checking your waistband
you got to whitney school
sharon is searching robby is noting all this his eyes appreciating the difference
lift your arms higher
got a good basketball team at st
you play basketball
sharon and robby are still on the job their unit rolling down a residential street of apartment buildings
a parked car is blasting music and robby halts beside it
sharon starts making dancing moves to the music sitting there beside robby and he stares at her as she grooves kidding it
then robby hits the horn to get the drivers attention in the parked car
robby makes a gesture to lower the volume and the man snaps off his tape
robby rolls on glancing at sharon
she wears a small smile checking their beat
whats going on pogo
youre not happy or anything
well its a mix robby
life is shit but im dating this great dead guy
she smiles at robbys look
he says before i came along he thought he was dead
sounds better when he says it stops abruptly listen
robby stops the unit rolling the windows down
they hear the faraway sound of
the trumpet player
robby pulls over
this time we got his ass
they exit the car and stand in the street looking up scanning the dark buildings but the sound is hard to track a faint ballad on a skillful horn
look at that moon
they stare at the full moon
in a moment we hear the sound of roaring cars their tires screeching as they turn onto this street one car speeding ahead to cut off the other and force
it to stop
the two male drivers are screaming at each other
robby shakes his head
full moon man
they run toward the drivers who are exiting their cars to confront each other
one big guy carries a baseball bat
robby heads off one driver while sharon intercepts the this guys crazy
this asshole side swiped me
are you mcguire
then put that bat away
put it in your trunk
the man hesitates then moves toward his trunk
i never touched his car
you lying bastard
the man charges bat in hand and sharon makes a flying tackle bringing him down hard on the street and we immediately
as she lies on the bed on her stomach her top off and catch straddles her massaging her back and shoulder which are sore from her tackle
as he works how heavy was this guy
like a truck
thats really good
she begins to moan as he digs out the pain
he is fighting against the erotic charge of this trying to keep it medicinal but hes got his hands all over her naked back and she is moaning so he
stops and takes a breath
he reaches to the bed table and puts oil on his hands noticing a card that stands open on the tabletop a very pretty invitation
this is pretty
dont get oil on it
renewal of vows thats great
is this your parents
just put it down
im not going
she doesnt answer
he puts it down comes back to the slow rubbing of her shoulders her neck
in a moment
if i go my brotherll hurt me with the department
i got mad and knocked him down
all they need is a complaint
just leave it alone and keep rubbing
she moans in pleasure as he rubs trying to push all other thoughts away
he says you cant go
cant you rub without talking
then its been bad with my family a long time so the hell with it anyway
if they dont want me there i dont want to be there
then as he works bad how
but we see her eyes turn inward toward the old pain and for once she shares it
my father used to knock us around all of us
but im the one who called the cops finally
pause they say i turned against the family
catch works in silence a while absorbing this looking at sharon with more tenderness than ever
in a moment
they invited you
you dont know anything about it
so forget it
i know about family
what about it
a door you dont close
i didnt close the door
youre closing it now
family invites you you go
family shows up you welcome them in
what if they dont deserve it
then you forgive
you have all the answers
it seems like a chance doesnt it
a chance to make things right
id take it
then you tried yknow
and its up to them
sharon is considering his words but shes also deep in her old pain defensive challenging
you close with your family
that hits him but he keeps rubbing her gentle now looking a little lost
he doesnt answer
so why should i listen to you
but as he works her back in silence we see her facing her pain and thinking through it
just after dawn
catch is on the couch stirring in his sleep in the grip of an unsettling dream
we hear what he hears the voices of his wife his son murmurings
were not sure of the words even laughter
catchs eyes snap open jolted out of sleep but the voices dont stop and he suddenly sits up
the voices fade as he catches his breath gulping air
he tries to calm down
in a moment he rises and moves to sharons bedroom
he comes to the side of the bed and sees that she is asleep
he sits on the bed and studies her his dark thoughts dissipating as he watches her sleep his eyes going deep
in a moment he begins to raise a hand to brush her cheek the way awakened her before but he stops before touching her
instead he brings his face close to her and lightly kisses her
he kisses her again
she opens her eyes
they stare at each other
she raises a limp hand and touches his face
he begins to come close slowly for another kiss
she welcomes it
they kiss on the mouth very tenderly
they kiss again deeper
they kiss again and she holds him and he moves fully onto the bed lying over her and supporting his weight on his elbows and kissing and kissing and letting
go for once hungry for her because she is in his heart now and she is a salvation and there is a moment when they both pause and stare clear eyed acknowledging what they are doing and both of them abandon their fear and pain and begin to smile and they make love that way smiling as we slowly
the night of that same day finds us at this neighborhoody place with a lot of down to earth atmosphere and not a lot of noise like harvells in santa
monica earthy blues and jazz from a small band in a darkish club small dance floor
we pan during this slow number and arrive at a few dancing couples including sharon and catch who mostly just hold each other and sway
when their eyes meet there is a lot of deep pleasure there
the music ends
the small crowd applauds
couples head back to the tables but the little band goes right into a more up tempo but still earthy blues
sharon stops and pulls catch back onto the dance floor
he smiles and follows
this number has a driving beat and slowly we watch sharon drop her inhibitions and become more and more free out there and catch is smiling and wowed by her
and she laughs wowing herself and she keeps going getting wild and playful and its something to see
we linger on the joy and abandon
shes earned it
they go a little crazy happy crazy and in a while we
the blues club is emptying out
the band is finishing what seems to be its last number for the last of thinning crowd including a tired happy sharon and catch who applaud the end of the
catch stares at her
whats your favorite song
he rises as if to go to the band with a request
she smiles spent
catch im beat
so are they
i think theyre finished
its a surprise
she watches as he leaves her walks to the bandstand
he talks to the leader who is the piano player
from the instrument cases on the floor behind the piano catch picks up a trumpet case opens it
now sharons tired smile is changing to curiosity wonder
as he puts the mouthpiece on the horn nervous but excited too speaking to the piano player
gonna be good having you back catch
catch comes to the edge of the bandstand grinning a bit at sharon at his surprise for her nervously fingering the horn
he puts it to his lips
mouth open surprise and then smiling with the wonder and catch begins to play closing his eyes and rendering a ballad like the haunting angel eyes
sharons smile slowly fades replaced by a much deeper look not only because he is so good but because he is showing her his heart his love and even his
pain more than he can show her any other way
we intercut as he opens his eyes briefly watching her sending her the music closing his eyes again to fall into the song as sharons eyes fill at the beauty
and sadness of it and at this look inside her man
we keep the sound of catchs trumpet going as he and sharon exit the club and begin to stroll away arms around each other
in a moment he stops
he cant go another step
he has to kiss her
he holds her face and comes in for the kiss and above the music we hear her say softly
where ive never been kissed
he stops and stares a moment then takes her hand and walks her out into the middle of the traffic less boulevard and there in the center of the street
kisses her and she responds and it is their finest fullest moment lifting on the music and it is ironic and prophetic that at its peak they are washed over by the revolving light from a police car and a siren that chirps once as they break staring
we widen to see ray and sanchez in their police unit feet away
ray uses a small electronic bullhorn to say
are you in danger there
i was talking to him pogo
no thanks ray
everythings code four
sharon laughs aloud and walks with catch in hand to the police car her joy overwhelming any embarrassment
she gestures behind them at the jazz club
see that place
hes going to be playing there every weekend
catch notes the pride with which she says this
impressed to catch oh yeah
what dyou play
its music ray
you wouldnt like it
she waves and walks off with catch arms around each other
the cops watch them go
sharon is asleep alone in the tousled bed
catch is dressed putting a leash on bob glancing into the bedroom at sharon
there is love in his look and then a passing question too a residue of fear now that their relationship has begun in full but it all ends up in
a soft smile for her as he walks bob to the door
he hesitates at the door then walks into the kitchen and slides open that drawer of toys stares at them
sharon is waking sleepy
she rises finds a robe and slips it on calling out softly for catch
sharon sees that catch and bob are gone
she drifts to the window looks at the day looks down at the street and she sees them
she sees catch and bob on their way into the park across the street from the building
she smiles and moves into the bedroom to dress
catch is walking bob in the park but is also checking for someone studying the playground
he begins walking toward the swings
tommy catchs neighbor is playing in the sand with a metal truck
catch walks up to tommy carrying a bulging plastic bag but tommys attention is on bob and pets the big friendly dog
she sits on a bench nearby watching this smiling a bit
catch kneels in the sand beside the boy and he spills out the contents of the bag action figures superheroes soldiers
tommy goes wide eyed at the array
catch is pleased by the boys reaction
catch keeps a layer of emotion covered here
you like these
theyre for you
we can pretend its your birthday
tommy stares at him then back at the toys in delight
candace is walking toward them and catch turns to her
i hope you dont mind
theyre for me mom
her look of surprise questions him
kind of been saving them up
she kneels close to her boy the toys pleased but not quite knowing what to say
well thank you
thanks a lot
catch nods grins at tommy who is already at play with the figures
she has entered the park and witnessed this from a distance
she is angling toward the playground
he watches tommy at play with the figures but its almost too much for him
he touches the boy and rises smiles and nods at candace and begins to walk off
she hurries her steps to intersect with catch
wow tommy look at them all
did you say thank you
now tommy looks up
catch is moving away with bob walking home
tommy stands up candace calls out to stop catch
but he is walking on some of the emotion seeping through not darkness some old joy welling up
we see in b
tommy starts to run after him to say thanks
we now have a convergence of tommy sharon and catch who is moving steadily toward the street crossing a bike path now
a biker is coming on
all in one moment catch hears the whizz of the bike tommy calling out thank you and candace shouting be careful
and catch goes cold inside and turns quickly and rushes onto the bike path taking the collision with the bike so tommy is sure to be safe
catch and the biker fall hard
sharon stops holding her breath
tommy watches wide eyed and candace comes running
catch is rising a little sore and soiled
the biker is angry
goddammit i saw the kid
i wasnt even close
but catch is walking away with that frozen numb look all shut down by his fear and his memory as bob trots along beside him and the biker comes after
him and tommy and candace watch him go and sharon hurries her steps to catch up
the biker reaches catch first
wait a minute
but catch wont turn to him walking on and the man gets in front of him raging
why the hell did you cause a wreck
i told you i saw the kid you idiot
pain and darkness build in catchs eyes until he says in a quiet choked voice right into the bikers face
one more word and your life will change forever
the man stops talking looking at the dead certainty in catchs eyes
he wants to say more to save face but catchs look holds him like a fist
sharon has stopped frozen watching
the biker turns away and walks back to his downed bike as catch moves on
sharon can hardly believe all of this following catch again
it takes a moment for her voice to penetrate then he quickly turns and sees her approaching
are you all right
your elbows bleeding
but he is tight nearly frozen everything held in
he walks away from her and this shakes her and she catches up again
where are you going
catch youre scaring me
but he walks on desperate and she gets in his way faces him
please catch dont
cant you talk to me
he turns and walks off heading for the street
he has walked into traffic not completely unmindful of the cars but desperate to get away
she watches this frozen as horns blare
he has to stop in the middle of the street to wait a moment and he stands there stricken
as the traffic moves around him and the dog a horn blares brakes screech and he thrown into a storm of
that come sharper and faster than before bits and pieces of memory outside any order he is driving annie smiles at him headlights blind him annie screams the little boy
in annies arms grins at him brakes scream annie says something to him calmly but he cant hear her the headlights blind him again and brakes scream again and catch stands there shaken and shut down
watching him shocked and frightened for him
she sees the traffic let up and catch crosses and walks toward home
she watches him go
as robby and sharons police unit moves along with traffic
in a moment they pull over and park beside an office building
it is the same building the man entered shouting catch
sharon watches the buildings entrance
after a while
are you going to tell me why were sitting outside this building again
watching for somebody
grey blond hair
whats it about
fine what am i supposed to do
she watches the building studying the people who come and go
catch is at home still shaken by what happened to him in the park
he reaches for the phone punches in a number
it rings and elanora chu picks up
catch is deep in his pain
how are you
have you been out in this great afternoon
brenda took me for a walk
she senses the silence on the other end and quiets a bit
she is quiet for a moment
this is good
no theres good to remember
he doesnt speak shakes his head
ill call you
he hangs up staring at his thoughts
sharon is still staking out the office building
robby is fidgeting
she just keeps watching
when robby begins to speak she puts up a hand to stop him going very still staring out the window at the man who catch was afraid of richard pindella
the man enters the building
sharon gets out of the car intense
give me fifteen
and she hurries after the man
as sharon enters sees the man at the elevators
he gets into an elevator and she just misses him
she watches the elevator indicator
it stops at two
she hurries up the stairs
as sharon bangs into a hallway through the stairway door
she looks one way looks the other way down the long hall and sees the man just entering a door
she walks to that door
it is marked private
she knocks and walks in
she enters a comfortable office many shelves books couch and chairs big desk
she hears the mans voice from an anteroom
hes coming toward her
excuse me thats a private entrance
he sees her now sees the uniform
is there a problem
hes calm gentle in the eyes
she stares a moment trying to keep her emotions undercover
im not sure
who am i speaking to
she takes her time afraid
what kind of doctor
what is this
do you know a catch lambert
is he in trouble
need to talk to you
he glances at his watch worried for catch
well i have a patient in five minutes
but i can

my relationship with mr
lambert is confidential
shes dying inside but covering lying forcing her way into this
hes your patient
hes your patient we
know all this
this is police business
im officer sharon pogue l
i want to help mr
lambert but i cant tell you anything that isnt public record
hes your patient and he
hes not my patient
he walked away from treatment
nearly a year ago
why did he walk away
i cant discuss that but if you know how to reach him i would appreciate being able to talk to him
desperate you can help by just telling me whats in the public record
itll take me half a day to do a search
can you tell me
she is unable to play this out as a cop her emotions coming through
pindella sees this
she sits on the edge of a chair and takes a breath speaks more softly
can you please tell me whats in the record
he stares a moment sympathetic and realizing
you were with him in the car
your uniform threw me
are you his friend
she looks at him nods
he takes that in leans back on the desk
i can tell you he was in an accident hospitalized referred to me as an outpatient
a city bus hit his vehicle
that was a couple of years ago
an awful thing
his family was in the van
his wife and child
his wifes parents
and a van
something is pulling at her memory
her vision turns inward and she stops breathing for a moment remembering
she was there
and here we get a
a glimpse of the carnage what she saw first on the scene with catch lying there
all the while pindella is speaking
i think so
near santa monica
on the freeway
he was severely injured but
the others were trapped in the van
still in shock looks at pindella again
i was there
i was there
pindella stares then
his wifes mother survived but
she was paralyzed
she takes a moment absorbing this
shes still in town i believe
still see her
he used to
i dont know
pause im glad to see
he has someone else who cares about him
i know hes running from this
he left all his friends his home his whole life
he doesnt remember the accident
he lost a lot of memory
i tried to help him with that
i think he remembers me
very subdued now she asks
how does he live
he received a large settlement from the city but he
barely touches it
he was a professional musician
she stares at him and nods
as he says that we hear our trumpet music begin a fast and furious muted trumpet incredible riffs and we use this to carry us as we
sharon is in the report room using the computer hunting
we move around to see her and the screen
she is searching the police records to find the accident
the continuing trumpet riffs are the motor for this
she suddenly stops as we focus on the name lambert
then we watch her as she punches up the data and she reads
we move through sharons nearly dark apartment its stillness in strange contrast to the manic trumpet riffs
we pan to find her curled in a chair staring deeply sadly drinking a drink
as we pan we discover she is looking at that mural of the mountains and through this to her thoughts and then she makes a decision and rises and goes
to the phone punches in a number
he is sitting on his bed back against the headboard sitting there fully dressed shoes and all knees up as he plays his muted trumpet hard and fast playing the
incredible riffs weve been hearing playing in a driven way keeping his demons away
when the ring of the phone breaks through he stops suddenly
his machine clicks on and beeps
we intercut the call as sharons voice comes on subdued
catch its me
can you pick up
but he sits there waiting listening
why dont we
ill be in westwood
can you meet me there
westwood and cole
about two oclock
he sits there
he slowly puts the horn down
he reaches for the phone now but she hangs up before he picks up the call
catch waits on a busy street corner in westwood village not far from santa monica
he is waiting glancing over the passing crowds for sharon
he sees her
she is off duty out of uniform
he watches her until she spots him
she smiles a little but there is a mix of fear and sadness in her smile
they walk to each other and stop and hug but it is brief and then she keeps walking slowly and he walks beside her
there is a strain lingering between them
shar im sorry about yesterday
its hard to explain but its
im okay now
you dont have to explain
he glances at her wondering walking along
whyd we meet here
so youre the trumpet player who was waking people up on my beat
they walk along in silence a moment
i used to practice late
on my roof
on your roof
thats why we couldnt find you
i didnt know it bothered anybody until you mentioned it
you arresting me
they smile nervous smiles
she walks on leading him somewhere
he looks about beginning to show some agitation but covering it
you going to tell me where were going
as she doesnt answer thats okay
ill go anywhere with you shar
jaws of death
the mall on a saturday
just about any
he slows his steps looking across the street and down half a block
we see an ivy covered brick building there with a sign that is too far away for us to read
he looks quickly away from that building
she sees his growing agitation
you can trust me you know
she takes his hand
ive got you now
im holding on like before
what dyou mean
like i held you before
like i did at the accident
he suddenly pulls his hand out of hers shocked and it shakes her
what makes it so
what makes it like that
he begins to shut down to grow cold and numb and not hear this
is it because you were driving
he turns away closing his eyes
i read the reports and it wasnt your fault
is it because you survived and they didnt
she puts her hand out for him again
hold on and well go in there together
he does not take her hand so she takes his and walks a few steps toward that building
you can talk to them
you can say goodbye or i love you or whatever
he pulls his hand away again more violently a layer of rage over his pain
this is wrong
why are you doing this
to help you
i dont need your help
i dont need this
we dont need this were fine
were not fine catch
nothing is fine no matter how much you pretend
it is as if shes fighting for his life again and her own
you pretend that nothing happened
you walk all over the city helping people but youre dying inside
im not dying
im not pretending
i dont remember
i dont remember any of it
so leave me alone
what good does it do
and im all right this way
why do you have to change it
im all right
she points at the building across the street
then walk in there
he cant even look at the place
walk in there and ill walk in with you
walk in there and say its real what happened is real
your family died
dont talk about that
breaking down all right you talk about it
you tell me your family died and i say yes i know im sorry and you say i loved them
and i say what an awful thing to lose a family
unravelling damn you shar
damn you why wont you stop
so you can have a life
i have a life
we could have a life
we could get up and go to work and come home to each other and never never talk about before
we dont need to do that
why do we need to do that
because it happened
because its the truth
im so sorry it happened but
if we say it then thats the truth that can be the truth
say it shar
catch take my hand
im asking you to say it
her tears come and she shakes her head
because i want it too much
i want everything with you
i want all of you not just the part that isnt hiding and running away
why are you pushing so hard
why does it have to be your way
why does it have to be your truth
this is who i am
this is the way i am
it doesnt have to be this way anymore because youre not alone because were the family now
we can be the family
you like to push people dont you
you just have to push and shove and make it right for you for you
you push everybody shar
you even pushed your family away didnt you
he has stung her
the tears are in her throat
she has to take a moment but she pushes through to say quietly
want to say
you already said it
you said it all
when youre ready ill be there for you
i just want to say that
and she turns and walks away
he watches her go angry scared and sorry for what he said
he takes a few steps after her wanting to call out and to stop her
we see him almost call to her
he is coming apart watching her needing her so much but unable to call out
he is shaky
he takes a glance at that building then away
he stares after sharon but shes out of sight now
he steels himself then looks across the street again at that building
he is desperately afraid
he stares at the building a long while
he begins to cross the street
he makes fists to keep from shaking
he walks to the entrance
this is the wellston memorial chapel and mausoleum
the sign is on one of the brick pillars
the iron gate is open
he cant walk in there
he just cant
he walks away quickly as if escaping
the new shift of cops is heading for its cars sharon and robby ray and sanchez others
the mood is relaxed teasing talk but sharon is way down
she tries to push her mood away and tough through it
rib house after shift today
i think ill head home
bring your friend
no i think ill turn vegetarian
gotta have that meat to keep your strength up
how come its not working for you
there is a scattering of laughter almost by rote as sharon enters her car without even the hint of a smile
she just punches up the cad monitor all business
our trumpet music comes in aching now and takes us into
she is exercising on the machine sliding into her crunches fast and furious but all the pain and sorrow is in her eyes and in a moment she just stops
the trumpet music keeps going on through this
she looks over at the phone
we pan over bob the dog watching something
we see a few scattered sheets of music lying about hearing rustling and we arrive at catch seated on the floor shuffling through a stack of sheet music driven looking
the phone rings
he ignores it
he is opening up each chart of music shaking it out searching
sharons voice comes on his machine almost hollow with sorrow
pause will you call me
he keeps searching seeming to not even listen
the machine clicks off
he shakes the next music chart and something falls out
he stares at this piece of paper picks it up slowly turns it over
it is a picture of himself a man blowing a horn drawn in crayon by a four or five year old
catch stares at this with a depth that goes on forever as the music ends
sharon and robby are rolling to a stop in a strip mall parking lot exiting their car
shes still very downbeat
as they walk from the car he keeps glancing at her concerned for her
she puts up a hand to brush all the words away
she cant talk about it
she pushes through it by doing the work
which store is it
the little market there
they came through a back window last night
they walk on but as sharon reaches the sidewalk a little child three years old or so toddles out the door of a shop
a skateboarder is rattling along and sharon makes a grab for the child taking his arm gently
and pulling him to safety as the skateboarder passes by shouting
and now the worried mother is emerging from the shop
oh god thank you
she picks up her boy walks back into the shop
sharon stands there as it all blooms inside of her rocks her really this little act evoking catch who he is what he said and what he means to her
robby is a few steps ahead waiting for her but she cant move yet looking around her now at the people walking among the shops and cafes
she picks one
she catches the eyes
she gives a brief smile
the smile is answered shyly kindly the person moves on
she doesnt move for a moment
then she turns to robby
theres something i have to do
i need an address and phone
whats the name
robby looks at her then nods giving her this
lets do it
they walk back to the car
we see sharon walking quickly from her police car to the front of mrs
robby waits in the unit
sharon walks under that covered portico to the front door but before she rings the bell a voice startles her a bit
chu emerges from the shadows of the portico rolling her wheelchair toward sharon
she has a smile for her but with some reserve
im sharon pogue
i know all about the
sharon nods very held back
she gestures toward the wheelchair self consciously
im sorry for
i know about the accident
hopeful he told you
i found out and
i was there
sharon stares a moment begins with some of her tough cover in place over her emotions
i guess he comes here a lot to talk to you
he shops for me
twice a week
and when he comes here he never mentions the past never talks about the accident
let him do that
all this time
its what he needs
walking all over the city like
like an angel
you let him get so lost
elanora is a bit defensive now
i let him find his own way through it
why did you come here sharon
i want to know how to help him
you are helping him
i dont think so
he was paying me back i guess for the accident for helping him
thats why he felt
so close to me
is that what you think
but now he probably hates me
i took him to the cemetery and
elanoras look darkens and she begins to shake her head in worry
i thought it might help him
come back you know
but he wouldnt even go in
he screamed at me
upset what made you take him there
for the truth
he knows the truth
but he wont even say it or
thats his way
thats his way through all this
he made a wall around that whole day that night other things too
he keeps them behind the wall his little boy my daughter
he cant help it
do you know how hard it is for me to go to the cemetery
can you imagine
sharon is shaken by this realizing crumbling a bit as mrs
chu goes on
thats where it stares you in the face the loss
and its too much sometimes
elanora takes a breath acknowledging how upset she is
im still finding my way through it
and catch it almost kills him to think about it or say it or drive a car or see the place where it happened or
go by the cemetery
i was trying to help him
come back to some kind of life
but he was coming back
do you realize how much he changed in the past weeks
his apartment his life his music is coming back
he fell in love
he even got a job sharon for you
for the two of you
isnt that coming back
why do you have to rush
everybody has to rush these days
sharon battered by the truth of this is totally exposed now realizing admitting
i was scared
i push so hard
when im scared
scared of what
so i did
i lost him
he wont talk to me
i didnt know what i was doing
elanora sighs looking at her and her anger drains away studying sharons misery
you were finding your way
what else can we do
you think im always sure what to say to him what not to say
i do what i think is right and hope he sees the love in it
she shakes her head at sharons tears her warmth showing now liking this girl
look at you so worried now so miserable
thats the love in it
make it worse for him
i dont know
i really dont
but i think hell see the love in what you did
sharon stares without much hope
she puts out her hand to touch elanoras to say goodbye
elanora takes her hand and holds on a moment staring into the girl with strength
sharon nods and walks off dark and sad
elanora watches her go
its the next day and sharon is preparing to go to her parents renewal of vows
she is at the bottom with catch gone from her life but she is doing her best to go through with this
we start on a table looking at the invitation and next to that is a wrapped gift
we hear sharon moving about see her nervous half dressed speaking to herself
in the b
we hear our trumpet based music
i just came by to
wish you well
congratulate you and wish you well
she checks the mirror again doesnt like the look starts undressing comes back to the table with the gift on it wonders if she should add more decoration to the
she does and as the trumpet plays on we dressed differently re wrapping the gift and then dressed differently rewrapping it again and then sitting still in a chair holding
the gift on her lap looking at the clock nervous scared sad
catch is walking down a commercial street no bob the dog no strolling gait
he is focused deep eyed on a mission of some kind
our music continues over this and on into
the music continues over sharon driving to the church parking taking a deep breath exiting the car
there is no one else outside the church
the ceremony has already begun
shes planned it that way
she enters the church as the music fades out
as sharon comes in quietly
the church is not full but perhaps people sit in the front pews watching the ceremony at the altar the priest mr
pogue altar boys
sharon moves forward and slips into a pew a few back from the altar
the slight disturbance of people sliding over to let her in causes a few people to glance over
one of them is kathy
they trade a brief nervous nod
then kathy whispers to her husband
we see larry grow tense and angry
dont say anything
think of your parents
larry doesnt look at sharon
the little boy looking fine in a tiny suit and tie and being bored leans to look at his aunt
sharon and larry jr
trade a look
she winks then settles back in her pew watches
we get our first look at sharons father carl pogue
standing beside his wife a rather big stolid guy taken with the moment both he and his wife emotional over this
he wears a hearing aid
the priest is speaking
watching with a mix of feelings as the mass continues and the vows are renewed the priest reciting the rituals
the priests voice from the church plays over this scene invoking the blessings saying the prayers of the mass as we watch catch continuing his mission slowing his steps now
and pausing at the entrance to the welston memorial chapel
we see the price hes paying and the determination
he walks through the gate
he walks into a courtyard of several small buildings in a garden setting all red brick and ivy fountains and flowers
he is fighting his way through this moving closer to one of the buildings
he is nearly alone on the chapel grounds and as he reaches the sheltered wall of this building he is alone
this is a wall of bronze vaults within the bricks and on each vault is a plaque a name
his breath shivers in his body as he struggles to lift his eyes
slowly his gaze comes to rest on a name lambert
as he stares the priests voice from sharons church fades out and we are left with silence
catch is shaky
he takes a step closer to the wall to the name to them and he tries to speak but cant
he tries again his voice intimate just above a whisper at first
want you to think i forgot about you
its just that i
i couldnt find you
pause i woke up and you were gone
everything was gone
it all just
in one minute
i couldnt remember that minute
i lost it
it took me so long to find it
i think i found it all now
i used a calculator
i figured it out
we get about minutes a day and so i figured it out
i was years old and three months and eight days so it was
ive got it here
he fishes a piece of paper out of his pocket
his hand is shaking as he reads a number off the paper
it was minute number million eight hundred ten thousand two hundred
he puts the paper away
thats the one i lost
when i lost that minute i guess i tried to lose it all all the memories because they hurt
i tried but
i couldnt do it
to that minute and for once we go in order and play out each piece of it
we see catch driving the van his wife annie beside him
his son chet is in back with his grandparents elanora and her husband
the boy is a bit whiny pouty
we intercut the flashback with at the grave struggling through this
you werent feeling so good remember
it was your birthday and you ate too much
we see annie and catch both glance back toward chet and we get present sound in this flashback scene as catch and annie both say whats the matter
and then annie looks out the window and turns to catch and we cut to catch at the grave his eyes filling
and annie you said
in the flashback we see annie turn to him again and this time we hear her say softly
slow down in the rain all right
we go to catch at the grave fighting tears
and i dont know if i slowed down
i dont know
i hope i did but
i didnt always listen
im really sorry
back in the flashback we see annie reach around as elanora hands chet to her
then were back at the grave and intercutting so that we see catch speaking through his tears and we also see this tender moment played out in the van
you put him on your lap and he looked at me and i made a face
i made you smile chet
and then we all smiled and it was a great minute
im really glad
i found that minute
no matter what
catch stares at the grave in tears as the rest of that minute now plays out punishing him
it lasts only about three seconds a bus out of control headlights suddenly glaring through the windshield catch turning the wheel brakes screaming people screaming and then its over
and catch has been battered by the memory and is weeping but has not looked away
he is still staring at the name of his family and he is able to say in a broken voice
i wont forget
i love you
he steps forward and puts his hand on the plaque rests it there
we stay on this then in a moment we
the renewal of vows is over and sharon is standing in the aisle nervous and not sure what to do
guests are up and milling about many leaving the church
see you at the house
see you at the party
a photographer is setting a group shot at the front of the church
pogue larry and kathy and the little boy
the whole family in this one
out of the milling crowd comes sharon taking a breath and braving it walking up there speaking quietly
where do you want me
the photographer turns to her wondering
im the daughter
oh well how about
we see the family shift so that larry and his family are on one side of the parents
sharon follows the photographers gesture to stand at the other side beside her mother
her father has not looked at her
the photo is taken
sharon now turns to her mom and dad
this is difficult the strain is thick in the air
you both look so great
nervous you too
i just wanted to
the father speaks to her his voice not hard but flat not warm either
you coming to the party
he nods then turns to greet well wishers
sharon is left alone by the drifting away of the family but one old couple greets her the older woman mrs
vander wearing her new blue dress her husband beaming beside her
look how nice you look
big police officer now
not so big
vander nice dress
sharon moves off toward a side exit trying to catch up with larry and his family
as larry and his family exit and sharon comes out of the church calling ahead
he starts to just walk on ignoring her but kathy takes the little boy and walks ahead with a look at larry at sharon
they nod to a few passing guests
then theyre alone
his nose is still bandaged but less so anger and betrayal in his eyes
how did you have the guts to walk into a church after breaking your word
i have to be here
its a chance to make things right and im taking it
why even talk go me
you got what you wanted
you laugh about it
you tell your cop friends how you
you think i talk about it
she stops herself catching her rush toward the old anger
she goes calmer deeper even sad
she hands him something
it is the polaroid photo
he looks at it surprised
they lock eyes
she speaks softly
i was invited
im going to the party
you do what you want
and she walks off toward the parking lot
were in the midst of the party
we see sharon drifting a bit a hello here and there
she feels out of place
though the home and yard are thick with people there is some tension especially in the core group all who know about the estrangement of sharon
now and then a nervous glance from her mother is directed at sharon or a hostile glance from larry
sharon passes the videographer who is pointing light camera and microphone at the vanders having them put their good wishes on tape
she smiles then looks over and sees her father across the room
he is alone
she steels herself and heads his way
he makes eye contact then averts his look
she is approaching him about to speak when he walks up to some friends and starts joking with them leaving sharon hurt humiliated
her mother has seen this and comes to her speaking quietly nervously
dont make him talk about
mom i was going to fix his tie
his tie is crooked
she sighs pushing through her hurt to say
it was a nice ceremony
were running out of chicken though
nobodys eating the ham
its a great party mom
you look happy
some joy is allowed to surface in her mothers face
thirty five years and still in love huh
her mothers look clouds a little nervous again
you think thats wrong dont you
of course not
i feel like apologizing to you
but i love him
and then i feel like apologizing to him for loving you
im the one in the middle
im the only one in this family who knows how to forgive anybody
and she walks away
sharons eyes follow her surprised and thoughtful
she watches her mother approach her father and straighten his crooked tie
then kathy is moving toward sharon
sharon turns to her and they both speak quietly at the same time
you look great
then they smile sad smiles
kathy gestures to her face the faded bruise
tons of makeup
on larry too
they smile wryly again
sorry about that but
i couldnt stand him doing that to you
i took it on
im not your mother
if he tries it again im gone
im out of there me and larry junior
he knows that
they stare and sharon gives her a hug kathy returns it
we see larry across the room notice this hug
he keeps his expression intact for the group hes in but we see a flare of anger in his eyes
moving across the living room
she sees larry jr
sitting alone and goes to him sits beside the child who looks sad
whats up with you
they wont let me watch t
lets pretend this is t
its a show about a party
they look about the room
as if its a secret that man
is really a super hero
and so is she
red tights under her dress
oh oh that man gave her a drink with something in it
with stuff to make her sleep
hes a bad guy
the woman sips her drink and the boy smiles getting into it
she drank it
shell fall down any minute
the boy is suddenly swooped up lifted away by his father
larry puts the boy down near the door
hey sport you should go play outside
he turns to sharon
stay away from my family
then he turns to the crowd smiling a smile without humor speaking loudly
hey everybody keep it down
somebody might call the police
there is some nervous laughter people watching them now
sharon is angry and embarrassed keeping her voice low
whatre you doing
to crowd once the cops leave we can really party
the crowd around them is all staring now as he turns back to sharon
why dont you give everybody a break and go home
in the hushed tension that follows a glass falls and shatters and more people quiet down and stare
sharon looks at her glaring brother looks at her mother nervously picking up the broken glass no support there
angry and shaken she turns to the door
she walks to the door opens it starts to leave starts to close the door behind her and she stops take takes a breath battling hard against the old patterns
of hurt and anger
she looks at that nearly closed door
she pushes it open and walks back in
we see a surprised and angry look from larry a worried look from her mother but sharon is moving through the crowd searching until she sees her father
she heads toward him
he sees her and walks into the kitchen avoiding her
she follows him
we see larry and his mother exchange an anxious look and then move toward the kitchen
sharon enters waits others are leaving the kitchen leaving her alone with her dad but he starts to follow them
dont walk away
he acts as if he just noticed her
she gestures toward his hearing aid
is it working
do you need to check it
he absently touches the device
but the kitchen door opens
we hear the party going on out there
larry and sharons mother enter her mother looking at her husband and back to her daughter very frightened
larry is raging in a near whisper
what the hell are you doing
will you stop protecting him
you were always protecting him
dont talk to your father
dont bother your father
she turns to her dad
im going to bother you for one minute dad
can you handle that
larry advances on her
just get the hell out
and she turns on him in a fury that halts him
this isnt about you larry or you either mom
this is between me and my father so leave us alone for one goddam minute
she turns back to her father
how about you dad
do you want me to leave
up to you
am i welcome here
jesus youre here arent you
what dyou want
i want to know
then quieting do you want me here
do you love me dad
i want to know
the questions out and shes totally exposed now and the silence that follows breaks her heart
she nods toward his hearing aid
her voice is close to a whisper thick with tears
check that again
i feel like
he cant finish it
you feel like what
i feel like i dont have a daughter anymore
she takes the blow and doesnt crumble only her eyes show the depth of the pain
she speaks quietly softly
its a shame youre going to miss knowing her
youre going to miss all that
and she leaves brushing past larry and her mother
sharon comes out of the kitchen blinking back tears
the party goes on around her oblivious
she stops on her way to the door because she sees the video crew moving hunting the next guest and she makes a decision and walks toward them stops in
the light faces the camera
as they roll tape people turn gather watch
sharon speaks over a torrent of emotions
to camera hi mom and dad
we see her family coming out of the kitchen and walking into this surprised stopping still
being in this house reminds me of something
i was about ten i guess and larry and i were playing aliens remember lar
were making a lot of noise and dad comes home from work tired and pissed off
her mother is near panic larry staring hard kathy wondering
intercut their reactions during
were yelling like mad and dad bursts into the room and says what the hell are you doing
and im scared
im really scared
and i say were playing alien invasion dad and he says oh yeah ill show you a damn invasion and he picks me up picks me up off the floor
and throws me on the couch
i hit that couch and bounce off and he grabs larry and throws him on the couch and then
then he starts making these monster sounds and he says we came to earth to kick ass and i run at him and jump on him and he tosses me
on the couch and then larry and were laughing so hard i almost wet myself and he keeps tossing us and growling and beeping and it was
it was great
it was great and im never going to forget that
and i miss that
i miss it
so i just
i wanted to tell you tanks for that dad
she hands the microphone back and walks away as the surprised looks the deep looks of her father mother larry and kathy follow her
she walks to the front door and leaves
sharon exits and starts to walk away
she sees larry jr
look up from his play
he smiles at her
she returns the smile it means a lot to her and she walks on
as she reaches the gate she notices something across the street that halts her
she stops still surprised and so pleased
catch is there waiting near her car watching her now
as sharon walks to him so glad hes there needing him but still not sure of what hes feeling about her until she gets close and sees his eyes and
the way he opens his arms and they embrace and she holds on tight eyes closed
they break the embrace still holding on searching each others eyes
for what i said
in a moment he gestures toward the pogue house
was it bad
they dont like me in there
then they dont deserve you in there
she stares a moment more still together
thats a nice thing to say
its not a thing to say
its the truth
she can only look away not wanting to cry
why do you try so hard not to cry
she stares at him again
her throat fills with tears mouth is trembling a bit
she starts quietly finally with nothing held back but this is not anger as much as mourning
its not fair
the tears come and she doesnt fight them emptying the old old wound speaking through her weeping now
the first time weve seen her cry
its not fair
things got better for them because of what i did
things got better and id still do it
id do it all over again
and its not fair they shut me out
its not fair
i was and i didnt know what else to do
i didnt know how else to stop it
its not fair i dont have a family anymore
its not shar
he raises his hands to her face places a palm gently on each cheek and she covers his hands with her own and closes her eyes
they remain that way awhile
in a moment he lightly kisses her forehead
there is a depth to his words
were the family pogo
she opens her eyes staring deep into his
he has said it all as it is and as it will be
she smiles a bit through her tears and nods
he puts an arm around her shoulder and holds her tight against him as they walk to her car
she puts an arm around his waist
they reach the car and she unlocks it gets in behind the wheel as catch gets into the passenger seat
sharon just sits behind the wheel still shaky from crying
she puts the key in the ignition but doesnt move no longer sad but drained now
he watches her
in a moment he gets out of the car
catch comes around to sharons window
she rolls the window down concerned wondering what hes doing
is he leaving
but he reaches for her door and opens it and says without a fuss
she stares a long moment realizing but also making no fuss about it as she gets out of the car walks around and enters the passenger side
they close the car doors
catch starts the car and drives them away
drives them home
