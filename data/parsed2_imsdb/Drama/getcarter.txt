framed in the large picture window stands jack carter alone looking out at the night
he turns away as the heavy satin curtains close wiping him from view
a blinding beam of light cuts across the room
one pornographic slide after another hits the screen at the opposite end of the room
they show a dowdy group in some anonymous bedroom frozen in various stages of a sexual orgy
gerald fletcher is slumped on a sofa
his young wife anna is curled up beside him
sid fletcher operating the projectors remote control has the same flaccid appearance as his twin brother
jack carter drink in hand watches from an armchair
another slide hits the screen
gerald is getting turned on
he runs his hand along his wifes stockinged leg
anna shudders momentarily
she obviously finds his touch repulsive
carter watches geralds hand
removing the cigar from his mouth bollock naked with his socks still on
thoughtfully they do that up north
its his old stamping ground
carter turns sharply away to the cocktail cabinet
lights and sweet music happen when he opens it
the slide changes
must be a bloody contortionist still looking at the screen gerald continues
we dont want you to go up the north jack
jack and anna look at each other momentarily
there is definitely something between them
the slide changes
groans not suede boots
knock it off gerald
and get the clap
the slide changes
you work for us jack
we have connections in those parts
id hate you to screw em up
the slide changes
sid laughs raucously
the slide changes
what are you going for
to find out what happened
the slide changes
some hard nuts operate up there jack
they wont take kindly to someone from london poking his bugle in
i smell trouble boy
the slide changes
the law was satisfied
since when was that good enough
the slide changes
think again jack
express train plunges into a tunnel blackness
the compartment is full
jack carter sits in one corner reading a raymond chandler paperback farewell my lovely
the train speeds northwards
in the distance the stacks of a lonely power station belch a continuous stream of brown smoke
carter steadies himself as he comes along the corridor
a massive iron bridge crossing a river whips past
its mesh sides create an almost hypnotic effect
carter tips his head back and dispenses drops into his nose
the train breaks from another tunnel
evening light cuts across the track as the train hurtles on
carter pours himself a glass of water and takes out a small phial of brown pills
he swallows one
a chemical factory brightly lit passes by and the outskirts of the city appear
the train moves slowly along the platform and stops
carter collects his coat and briefcase from the rack
the street is fairly deserted
carter exits with other passengers from the train
he pauses and looks about before crossing to the pub opposite
a couple of youths are playing records on the juke box
an old man sits in the corner reading a newspaper
carter enters through the swing door and a weedy barman comes to serve him
pint of bitter
the barman picks up a glass mug and begins to draw the beer
carter snaps his fingers at him
in a thin glass
the barman sighs petulantly transfers the beer into a thin glass and puts it on the counter
a telephone rings
the second barman answers it
is there a mr carter in the room
carter walks to the far end of the bar and picks up the receiver
pause why the hell arent you here
he lights a cigarette
pause is doreen at the house
pause whos with him then
pause when can i see you
will you be there tomorrow
pause now listen margaret
the line goes dead
carter hangs up
a key hanging inside the letter box starts to move upwards and out through the flap
a moment later the door opens
carter is standing at the bottom of a flight of stairs in a workers terraced house
he closes the door and climbs the stairs
carter moves cautiously
his eyes scan the peeling wallpaper the mildew on the banisters
a roof leak hits an unseen bucket with depressing regularity
an unmade bed with pyjamas on it a beaten up wardrobe a dressing table and chair are about it
carter hears a vehicle stopping on the street below
he eases back the ancient net curtain
two men in a land rover are looking up
they see him and quickly drive off
carter looks around the room
on top of the wardrobe theres an old shotgun
he reaches up and brings it down
memories flood back
he reaches up again and finds a box of cartridges
more memories jack and frank grew up here
he leaves the gun on the bed and returns to the landing
an overhead light snaps on to the face of a dead man frank carter
he is lying in a coffin
his eyes are closed his skin made up like porcelain
carter stands over the coffin
he gently touches his brothers crossed hands and folds the shroud over his face
he exits turning out the light and closing the door
the landlady edna garfoot is climbing the stairs
shes well built sexy experienced
carter follows with his baggage
he watches her appreciatively from behind
i wont be using the room tonight
stops and turns i see
im staying with a friend
continuing up the stairs her husband docks tomorrow does he
smiles its not like that luv
it never is
the door opens and the light goes on
its a big room overlooking the road furnished cheaply but comfortably
edna and carter enter talking
are you a traveller
surveying the room will this do
looking around very nice
he takes his wallet out
ill pay you for tonight as well
dont be bloody silly
youre the first since monday
carter gives her the money
feeling the mattress ill bet this ones seen some action
carter smiles and looks straight at her
edna returns his look dead pan
ill give you the key when you come down
she closes the door
carter moves around the coffin as he shaves
his electric razor is plugged into the lamp above his dead brother
the coffin lid is being screwed down
carter stirs a cup of instant coffee while watching the undertakers at work
was he in bad shape
they come worse
the hearse is parked outside the row of terraced houses
a youthful undertaker is minding it
he turns and looks through the back window as a young girl walks up the street
doreen carter is sixteen and like most girls of her age tries to look older
she wears all the right gear but its cheap and doesnt fit properly
her long hair is lank
theres something sad and embarrassing about her appearance
the young undertaker watches as she enters franks house
the door opens slowly
doreen stands there looking at the coffin
carter sees her
she seems mesmerized by whats going on
all right are you
doreen doesn t answer
been staying with a friend
the undertaker coughs and thrusts another screw into the coffin
sorry about your father
tell me doreen did the police say anything
dazed they said he was drunk
the young undertaker is still in the hearse listening to the radio
in the driving mirror he sees the land rover moving slowly tip the road
it stops by the house
two men suss the scene and drive off
i left last year
oh what you doing now
working at woolworths
that must be interesting
carter and doreen look at each other awkwardly
what you going to do
live with margaret
doreen looks at him nervously shakes her head and fumbles in her bag for a cigarette
carter continues slightly indignant
well why wont you come with us to south america
my fiancee wont mind pause your dad would have wanted it
the undertaker puts the final screw in
to colleague get hughbert up will you
to carter were ready now sir
the undertakers struggle with the coffin down the narrow staircase into the street
outside carter and doreen wait with two men
eddie appleyard a middle aged man is wearing a shabby tweed suit cap and black tie
keith lacey is a young barman who worked with frank
we werent sure where it was taking place like
nice of you to come
frank was a good bloke
he was that
one of the best
through the windscreen of the following limousine carter can see his brothers coffin in the hearse as it moves slowly through the streets of the city
sitting in front on fold out seats are eddie and keith
i couldnt believe it when i heard
carter is suddenly attentive
i mean i was surprised when he didnt turn up for work
he was always on time
did you work with him keith
at the half moon
not to be left out its a bloody funny thing
you know a bloke for six bloody years and all the time hes as calm as gentle jesus
pause then he goes and does a thing like that
he shakes his head
its a bloody funny thing
a bloody funny thing
as the cortege drives into the crematorium it passes the land rover parked outside
the same two men who passed franks house are in it
a long and expensive looking funeral cortege passes out as they move up the driveway
carter doreen eddie and keith are in the front pews facing the catafalque on which franks coffin rests
the vicar is already midway through the solemn words of the committal when a woman enters
the clunk of her high heels cuts through the silence
everybody looks round
whispering to doreen is that margaret
franks coffin sinks out of sight
two men in long grey coats wait in silence
the coffin appears
expertly they take it and swing it on to a trolley
they push it up the wide corridor towards the furnace
one of the men starts whistling cheerfully
margaret is thirtyish blonde attractive in a tarty kind of way
her heels are too high and she is wearing a cheap pair of sunglasses
she walks quickly away down the cloisters past the memorial tablets and urns
carter comes out of the chapel and sees her
margaret stops and looks round
carter joins her
i thought you werent coming
changed me mind
they face each other in silence
margaret looks past carter and sees doreen watching them at the end of the cloisters
she turns away and starts walking slowly
carter moves with her
margaret continues nervously
everyhing go off all right
pause i want to talk to you
margaret stops in her tracks and looks back at doreen
shes still watching them
adamantly shes nothing to do with me
puzzled what do you mean
youve been franks bird ever since her mother cleared off
youre closer to her than anyone
shaking her head no
its not like that
ive got a husband you know
margaret starts walking again fast
carter catches hold of her arm and stops her
looking her in the eye who killed frank margaret
i dont know anything about it
she moves off rapidly
carter catches up with her
i must go
im in a hurry
i want to talk to you later
tomorrow morning then
well all right then
twelve oclock on the iron bridge
margaret walks off as calmly as she can her high heels clicking as she goes
carter watches her disappear
doreen watches too
franks coffin is slid inside the furnace
flames start to lick it as the steel trap closes
its a large room with a horseshoe bar in the centre a real boozer
a handful of hard drinkers are already in position
carter doreen keith and eddie are sitting alone
their table is already covered with glasses
doreen appears to be slightly drunk on babycham eddie on whisky and keith on beer
carter is stone cold sober
he raises his glass and drinks then continues thoughtfully
you dont think he might have done it on purpose
you mean like kill himself
eddie and keith look at each other
doreen watches them
she is getting very upset by the conversation
carter stares at keith who is getting uncomfortable
i mean what for
thats what i was wondering
come off it
he had no worries i know
hell we worked together every day for a year
it would have showed
why would it
it just would
he was always the same
since when did he drink whisky
nobody seems to know
doreen is now crying openly
finishing off his drink bloody good bloke
one of the best
blurts out how would you know
she suddenly jumps up and empties her glass in eddies face
none of you knew
he was me dad
she runs off out of the door crying
keith goes to follow
carter puts his hand out to restrain him
let her go
shell be ok
to eddie sorry about that
wiping his face with a handkerchief dont worry
shes bound to be upset
to eddie have another
ill be off now

eddie stands up cap in hand
carter pulls out a wad of money
he peels off a note
get your suit cleaned
its all right
standing pushes the note in his top pocket thanks for coming
frank was a good bloke
its the least i could have done
you work here keith
carter thinks for a moment then leans forward to keith
keith if anybody comes in here and asks for me you let me know
im at the las vegas
behind the dance hall
he casts an eye around the bar
do you know a man called albert swift
he comes in here a bit
where would i find him
at the races
he always goes
carter takes out his phial of pills
howd you know albert
went to school with him
smiles he was leader of our gang
hell know whats going on in this town
the rain has just stopped
bookies and punters lower their umbrellas
horses thunder towards the finishing post
turf flies in all directions as the jockeys whip their mounts in a last desperate effort and the crowd roars
albert swift is standing by a bookmakers marking bis race card with a biro
a hot dog is sticking out of his mouth like a cigar
a man of about thirty five be appears much older probably from an excess of booze and women
he looks up and his mouth drops open the hot dog falling to the ground
he has seen carter
carter is pushing his way along the line of bookies all the time looking about him
the track loudspeaker announces the winner of the last race
he holds his race card in front of his face and disappears into the crowd
as he moves off his foot steps on the hot dog and tomato ketchup oozes out
carter stands alone casting an eye over the punters
his eyes rest on someone the other side of the saddling ring eric paice
dressed in a grey chauffeurs uniform cap dark glasses and gloves he is standing close to three well heeled looking men with binoculars and shooting sticks
horses for the next race are being led around the enclosure
carter approaches from behind
he looks at eric closely before speaking
grey suits you eric
eric swings round startled

carter takes out his cigarettes
eric takes one

a track announcement interrupts them
so youre doing all right then eric

he cant resist it any longer
he lifts the sunglasses off erics nose and looks into his eyes

eric stares back
theyre still the same
piss holes in the snow

yes i retained that eric
he moves towards the saddling ring and turns to eric
do you know a man called albert swift eric
cant say i do
carter looks across at the track
dont miss the start on my account
starting gates slam open and the horses leap out
carter is driving along a country road
ahead two cars are between him and a cadillac with dark tinted windows
the cadillac turns on to a minor road
eric paice is driving
in the back sit the three men seen with him at the race track
the drinks compartment is open and they are helping themselves to champagne
racing results come over the car radio
carter follows the cadillac at a safe distance
it turns into a driveway
carter slows down and reads a sign by the entrance the heights
he drives on and parks
carter comes through a wooded area
he pauses by a lake now overgrown with weeds
a big man stands tossing stones into the water
carter silently picks up a dead branch then runs at the man
carter whacks him on the head and he collapses unconscious into the lake
carter moves on towards the house
marty and ray the two men previously seen in the land rover are playing with an alsatian on the spacious lawn fronting the house
its a victorian building surrounded by acres of woodland
carter breaks from the trees and darts for the side door
one of the men notices and shouts after him
carter runs into the house and slips into a small service room
ray and then marty charge inside but miss seeing carter
a game of poker is in progress
seated around the table are the three men with eric at the race track
with them is an elegant man cyril kinnear
on the sofa are glenda a sexy looking young woman and eric paice
ray bursts in
eric jumps up
i dont know

carter walks past ray blowing him a kiss
kinnear watches with some amusement
you see what its like these days jack
you cant get the material
carter looks at eric
yes i can see your problem mr kinnear

i really could
sometimes i think ill retire
just piss off to the bahamas and let somebody else employ them to girl glenda get jack a drink

ray closes the door behind him
glenda brings carter his scotch
he looks at her as she sits beside him
eric told me of your bereavement
do you know i never knew he worked in one of my places
neither did i
if id known id have fixed him up with something better
nasty way to go
one of the three men sitting around the table with kinnear gets impatient
peter les and harry are well heeled middle aged northern businessmen
are we here to play cards or talk about the old days
jack i dont want to be rude but these men have brought a lot of money with them
glenda you dont offer a man like jack a drink in those piddling little glasses

he picks up his cards

harry keeps a cold wary eye on him

to carter thought you were going soon

harry looks at his cards
glenda tucks her legs up making sure that carter gets an eyeful

carter looks back at the table
kinnear pushes in some money

kinnear lays more cash on the table
thats another hundred twenty five pounds notes of the realm
three hundred altogether

glenda attracts carters attention again

carter turns to the table yet again
harry nervously puts another hundred on the table
kinnear purses his lips
ill follow that and go two hundred
harry looks sick

harry sweats and then smiles nervously
raises an eyebrow ha
kinnear takes a wad of notes out of his pocket
glenda shifts herself on the sofa
i met him last year

carter getting bored looks back at the game
panicking whats that
thats six hundred pounds harry

harry sweats some more

harry smiles nervously
he counts some money out

glenda speaks but this time carter keeps his eyes on the table
kinnear lays out his hand a hearts flush queen high

carter smiles and does just that

kinnear leans across to pick up harrys cards
harry grabs them and puts them in the pack
kinnear turns to carter

he points at harry

eric opens the door and follows him out
carter moves towards the front door
i didnt like that
you should have told me who you were working for
cyril didnt like it either
oh cyril eh
so its all girls together is it
hes thinking sid and gerald wont like it much when they hear youve been sticking your nose in
carter carries on walking to the front door
he opens it
tell him to save the cost of the phone call
eric signals ray to follow him
huge metal claw catches hold of an old car and lifts it like it was a toy
the yard is beside the river tyne
in the distance a train crosses the iron bridge
carter is examining a beaten up hillman when the yard owner billy laws approaches
suspicious what do you want
what happened to this car
whats it got to do with you
this is my brothers car
well he drove it into the river
was the steering faulty
billy shakes his head
what about the brakes
nowt wrong with them
howd it happen then
he was drunk
drunk as a lord
a big busty pub singer is performing on the small stage
a trio on her right plays a good grinding up tempo number
carter comes through the door
he pushes his way through the packed drunken crowd to the bar
keith serves him
what you having jack
carter watches the singer
the customers cheer and whistle
keith returns with the scotch
he looks nervously around and speaks to carter quietly
heard of a man called thorpe
havent seen him in a long time
picking up carters money thats what he was saying about you
keith takes the money to the till
the music grinds away
said hed heard you were up in town
wondered if i knew where you was staying
wanted to look you up
old times sake
whatd you tell him
carter watches the singer then finishes his drink
see you later
where you off to
smiling las vegas
carter makes for the door
the singer is now moving through the tables
she pauses to give some man a kiss
the woman sitting with the man snaps
she picks up his glass of beer and throws it over the singer then grabs her hair and pulls her to the ground
carter stops to watch
the two women roll on the floor punching and scratching
carter smiles and leaves
on the corner is a neon lit snack bar
doreen and another young girl are sitting inside sucking milk shakes
somewhere a drunk is singing
his voice echoes up the alley
carter draws alongside and notices doreen
he stops and watches her
she hasnt seen him so he goes to the window and knocks on it
she looks up and he beckons her outside
reluctantly she comes
gently you all right now
you coming to south america
carters hurt and slightly irritated by this rejection
where you going to live then
at me friends house
nice family are they
church goers and all that
im off tomorrow so i dont suppose ill see you again
he pulls out a wad of money and peels off some notes
go and get your hair done
cant believe it thanks
he lifts her chin with his finger and looks at her
and dont trust boys
doreen blushes and turns away
she rushes back to the snack bar with the money to show her friend
the front door opens and carter enters
standing on the hall table is a small wooden casket with an envelope taped to it
carter pockets the envelope and picks up the casket
that was left for you this evening
carter walks past her into the sitting room
what is it
my brother frank
is he staying the night
he puts the casket on a side table
can i phone london
itll cost you
anna is undressing
pulling the short black silk underslip over her head she stands in front of a long mirror clad only in black panties bra and tights
she looks at herself appreciatively
the phone rings
she flops on the bed and picks up the receiver
a voice speaks on the end of the line
how i miss you
she stretches herself out sexily and smiles
stop it darling
its a cosy room
carter is on the telephone
edna sits in a rocking chair
looking at edna i fancy you
i wish i was touching you right now
edna turns towards him
carter fixes her with his eyes
edna rocks herself gently
carter continues softly
making love to you
i want to stroke you and kiss you all over
where are you
anna is lying full length on the bed
in the bedroom
carter speaks on the other end
my black underwear
edna rocks backwards and forwards
quietly the sexy silk ones
he continues softly
take your bra off
pause no go on
anna unhooks her bra
theres a flash of breasts
the scene as before
now hold them
annas hands cover her breasts
her head moves slowly from side to side eyes closed
scene as before
imagine its me
annas hand caresses the inside of her leg
her head rolls from side to side slowly
shes breathing heavily
cross cut between ednas head rocking backwards and forwards and annas head moving from side to side
when were in south america well make love in the sun
and make love again
i fancy you
suddenly the door opens and gerald comes in
he sees anna groaning on the bed
whats the matter
you got gut trouble or something
anna sits up abruptly and puts her hand over the receiver
just doing some exercises into telephone listen janet geralds just got in so i must ring off
ill come tomorrow
scene as before
save it till sunday
ill be back then
carter replaces the receiver
he still holds ednas eyes
she rocks to and fro
the rocker creaks
the front door bell breaks the mood
thatll be for me
carter opens the door
keith is outside
his tie is somewhere round the back of his neck and his suit is covered with dirt
they were waiting for us in the car park
four of them
carter pulls keith inside and turns out the light
a ford zodiac comes along the road
four faces peer into the darkness where theyre standing
nobody gets out
the back window winds down
thorpes nervous voice floats out
id like a word with you jack
you stay in the car
ill come and listen
he leaves the darkness and walks to the car
what you want to tell me thorpey
thorpe holds out his hand
ive been asked to give you this
he hands carter a railway ticket
train goes at four minutes past twelve
youve just got time
thats very kind of somebody
who do i have to thank
pause what happens if i miss the train
ive been asked to make sure you dont
youre getting very optimistic in your old age arent you thorpey
one of the men inside mutters
lets stop pissing about
are you coming jack
itd be best
carter tears the ticket in half and drops it in the gutter
the front passenger door starts to open
carter grabs it and pulls it wide open
with all his force he slams it against the man as he gets out
the window shatters over his head
blood spurts everywhere
the driver panics
he accelerates away as the man in the back is getting out
his foot is trapped in a safety belt
hes upended and dragged along the tarmac his head dangerously close to the back wheel
his yells make the driver brake
in the confusion thorpe escapes from the car and makes off
carter spots him and begins to run
thorpe turns into the main road
he makes for the dance hall and disappears inside
the dance floor is full mainly with miniskirted girls their handbags at their feet
a rock band play mechanical music to match the dancing
thorpe vanishes into the crowd circling the floor
he scans the place then sees thorpe as he disappears down into the gents lavatory
theres no sign of thorpe
he checks the cubicles until he finds the one thats occupied then goes into the next one
he climbs on the seat and looks over the partition
thorpe is sitting down looking at the door
carter quietly leans across and pulls the chain
thorpe jumps up terrified
times up thorpey
keith kicks broken glass into the gutter while he waits
ednas next door neighbour an old woman watches
carter and thorpe come down the street
hello keith pause stay there thorpey
he knocks on ednas door
it flies open
edna is furious
what the bloody hell do you think youre at
smiles im sorry

she points at thorpe
and whos he
whats going on

everybody knows you edna garfoot
everybody knew thered be trouble when you moved in
carter keith and thorpe enter the house
you keep your trap shut ma

and wouldnt he love it
carter thorpe and keith are climbing the stairs
carter stops to pick up franks casket
edna rushes in and slams the door
where do you think youre going
carter opens the door to his room
why dont you go and make us all a nice cup of tea
carter shoves thorpe into the room
and what you going to do
make us a nice cup of tea and ill tell you
i might even let you watch
ill call the police
he knows she fancies him no you wont
carter closes the door
carter carefully places the casket on the chest of drawers
well now thorpey
it seems ive got a secret benefactor
he moves into the room and opens his briefcase which is lying on the bed
its nice to know that
isnt it keith
he takes out a bottle of whisky
theres only one trouble i dont know who to thank
thorpe looks longingly at the bottle of scotch
suddenly carter punches him hard in the stomach
he grunts and collapses into a chair
now i want to know who it is thorpey
carter tosses the whisky bottle to keith and continues wearily
if you like thorpey well stop mucking about
somebody doesnt want me poking my nose into something and i happen to know what that something is
pause now stand up
thorpe looks at him terrified
slowly he stands
carter grabs him by the testicles and applies preasure
who paid you to see me off
i cant jack
how can i
yes you can
carter applies more pressure
no dont jack dont
who sent you thorpey
carter gives him a final squeeze and lets go
thorpe groans and slips to the floor doubled up in agony
there you are you see
now you could couldnt you
pause and quickly
theres a knock on the door
carter lets in edna who is carrying the teatray
ah edna come in
join the tea set
ever been to westsea
ever been into an arcade there and put a penny in the slot machine
ten to one it belonged to cliff brumby and like as not the bloody arcade as well
right along the coast

thorpe drags himself painfully to a chair
wheres he living these days
hes got a new place at burnham
on the durham road
furious suppose you tell me what the bloody hells going on
its my house you know
yes edna and i must say youve been great about the

thorpes plaintive voice interrupts
can i go now
you must be joking to keith keep him away from the telephone
im going out for a bit
now just a minute
dont let on i told you for gods sake
carter laughs and closes the door
its a large new ranch style house set back from the road
the front garden is a landscape gardeners nightmare with its phoney brick and wrought iron wishing well porcelain dwarfs lily pond the lot
fairy lights hang over everything
theres a party going on
lights are on in every room and the rock music is loud
the drive is lined with sports cars
carter parks and gets out
out of a side door a young man stumbles towards the lily pond
there he promptly throws up
carter watches from behind a tree
his attention shifts to the white bentley turning into the drive
it brakes sharply and the driver jumps out
cliff brumby has been to a police ball
he is impeccably dressed in tuxedo and white scarf
now hes hopping mad
mrs brumby cowers in the passenger seat
now cliff dont get mad
ill murder the little bitch
brumby roars up to the front door banging it furiously
a young woman in a party dress expecting to greet a latecomer is stunned to see who it is
thats right bloody daddy
i wasnt expecting you until three oclock
and this is what you call having a few friends back for coffee is it
brumby pushes past her into the house
running bloody riot over my bloody furniture drinking my bloody booze
the rest is lost as he disappears inside
he then powers out through the side door spewing over my fucking goldfish
he aims a kick at the young mans backside sending him face down into the lily pond
mrs brumby gets out of the car and hovers for a moment
as she approaches the house people pour out
brumby appears at the door with a boy pulling up his trousers
brumby throws the boy out
shut up phyllis
he walks back into the house
mrs brumby goes into the house and closes the door
brumby passes an upstairs window as sandra locks herself in a bedroom
unlock the door you bitch
carter pauses outside the front door and listens to the row going on upstairs
he opens the door and goes in
carter passes silently through the hall into the large sitting room
mrs brumby is sitting in an armchair
brumby is still yelling at his daughter upstairs
mrs brumby jumps
the front door is open
standing who are you
im an old friend of cliffs
i want to see him
mrs brumby looks at her watch irritably
whats it about
i know all about cliffs business
carter moves further into the room
yeah well tell him the fletchers sent me
mrs brumby is uncertain what to do
carter sits in an armchair to make his point
a moment later brumby storms into the room
what the bloody hells all this
carter doesnt move
you know what the bloody time is
pause its two oclock in the bloody morning
carter still doesn t move
the wife says the fletchers sent you
carter just looks at him
weighing him up
whats so bloody important it couldnt wait till the morning
carter starts to laugh
he realizes thorpe has lied to him
brumby isnt his man
listen im not in the mood for bloody silly buggers
i made a mistake
i made a mistake
brumby looks confused
its not business
carter moves to the door
brumby moves between him and the door
listen i dont like it when some hard nut comes pushing his way in and out my house in the middle of the night
carter again makes to leave
brumby stops him
bloody well tell me who sent you
youre a big man but youre in bad shape
with me its a full time job
now behave yourself
brumby swings at him
carter moves away from the punch then applies several sharp blows to brumbys head and neck
brumby groans and collapses into the armchair hurt
carter walks into the hall and out of the front door
good night mrs brumby
carter walks up the deserted street to ednas place
he finds the front door unlocked
carter enters cautiously
there is no sound
he closes the door quietly and pauses at the foot of the stairs
still there is no sound
a sudden rustle attracts his attention
quietly he moves to the sitting room door
carter switches on the light
edna is pressed against the far wall holding a poker
her dress is torn and her hair dishevelled
when she sees carter she sighs with relief
they came back
carter helps himself to a glass of water from the tap
edna looks at her torn dress
look at this
carter puts the glass on the table
you dont care a stuff do you
carter takes out his phial of pills
ill buy you another
carter swallows a pill
what about the lad
they took him away
carter shrugs his shoulders
whatll they do to him
dont ask me
edna rubs her wrists
they bloody hurt me
they kill as well
mocking him and what about you
did you kill brumby
carter shakes his head
thorpey nearly died laughing
that little shit
what about keith
what about keith
what you going to do
pension him off
youre a bastard
angry what am i supposed to do
i dont know where theyve taken him
edna shakes her head
so shut up
whats that gun doing in your room
suppose i phoned the police and told them theres a bloke staying in my hotel whos planning to shoot somebody
howd you know i wouldnt
smiling cos i know you wear purple underwear
whats that supposed to mean
think about it
carter takes hold of her torn blouse and rips it open
she is wearing purple underwear
its sunday morning
a girls marching band rehearses on the wasteground in front of the terraced houses
the pelaw hussars march back and forth carrying their proud banner led by the drum majorette
above the bed hangs a sign what would jesus say
in the bed lie carter and edna
the distant sound of the marching band helps them surface
are you awake
do you want breakfast
you must be joking
i never eat breakfast pause did you sleep well
the pelaw hussars keep on marching
the back of their banner a stirring motto for youth and valour
scene as before
did you sleep well
yes thank you
he puts his arm around her and moves on top
as the band executes another movement a red jaguar slides to a halt outside ednas house
two men get out
peter the dutchman and con mccarty are definitely not local lads
they look and are lethal
they try ednas front door
scene as before
are you tired
are you tired
im not tired pause do you eat breakfast
they start to make love
below the undulating bedsprings rests a large chamberpot and beside it carters shotgun
beyond is the bedroom door
it opens slowly and the two men enter
only their legs are visible
put us in it jack
carter is off the bed and edna in a flash
edna screams and tries to stop the bedclothes following carter on to the floor
peter and con stand beside the bed smiling
peter is a queer and dressed fancy in a leather coat wide bottomed trousers and a loud silk scarf
his hair is bleached blond
con is more traditional more butch
hes in a camelhair overcoat suit and tie
both are in their thirties
dont let us interrupt you jack
i might have guessed
sorry about this
but there you are
orders are orders
and what orders would they be con
carters hand runs over the carpet
its going towards the chamber pot instead of the gun
gerald phoned us in the middle of the night said hed heard youve been making a nuisance of yourself
weve got to take you back to london
he said itd be doing him a big favour
carters hand finds the chamber pot and quickly moves on towards the gun
we know why youre all steamed up and so do gerald and sid
but they have to be diplomatic
carter pulls out the gun and jumps up
now take me back to london
smiling itd be best if you got dressed first
carter moves around the bed towards them
put it away jack
you know you wont use it
the gun he means
both men are laughing
peter and con back down the stairs
peter looks up at carters cock
if anna could see you now
you know were going to take you back sooner or later
con is the first to emerge from the front door
mind you dont catch cold
i hope shes got understanding neighbours
then carter comes out shotgun held across his chest
see you when youve got your drawers on
the old woman next door chooses that moment to come out for her milk
as she straightens up she sees carter
the bottle flies from her hand and smashes on her doorstep
carter never taking his eyes off peter and con slowly backs into the house
carter watches from the window as he pulls on his jacket
the gun lies across the armchair
outside he can see peter and con talking by the jaguar
edna now in her dressing gown enters
do us a favour
what and get myself beaten up again
no chance of that
theyre friends of mine
and thatll make me feel better
i dont want to get rough do i
carter picks up the gun
he hands edna bis case and the casket
edna comes out of the back gate into an alley carrying the casket and case
con emerges from his hiding place holding a handgun
where do you think youre going
carter appears from the gate next door covering con with the shotgun
he takes cons handgun and signals him to go into ednas yard
he points the gun at the coalshed
open that door
con unbolts the door
and go inside
con goes in
carter closes and bolts the door
he moves quickly back to edna and the car
what you going to do
im going to sit in the car and whistle rule britannia
carter jumps into the car
you coming back
how could i stay away
the car roars off
washing hangs behind each house as far as the eye can see
carter drives full tilt through it collecting towels and sheets on the windscreen
the coalhouse door is getting a terrible battering
it finally gives and con bursts out
he runs into the alley following after carter
carters car screeches as it corners from the alley on to the road
peter is leaning against the open door of the jaguar
when he sees carter coming straight at him he scarpers for the pavement
carter hits the jaguars door at speed tearing it off
it flies up and crashes on to the tarmac as carter careers over the wasteground
soon he is out of sight
con comes running
peter is looking at the damage
where were you then
con sees whats happened to the car and is not pleased
carter pulls up outside a house and gets out
he takes the washing off the cars bonnet and throws it into a neglected garden
carter presses the bell
the doors opened by a young man keith in
shamir watches carter as he walks into the hall
which is his room
carter enters and closes the door
keith is in a had way his face like a piece of raw steak
he is lying on a bed still in the clothes of the night before
what happened to you then
howd you find me
keith lifts his head painfully from the pillow
did they give you a rough time
he lowers his head to the pillow
you knew theyd come back
no i didnt pause does albert swift still live over the ferry
i want to square things with you first
carter takes out of his wad of money
keiths bloodshot eyes watch him through the surrounding puff of flesh
my girl friends coming from liverpool tonight
nice surprise isnt it
thisll pay for a course in karate
he throws some money on the bed
keith tries to kick it off but its too painful
he clutches his testicles
frank said you were a shit and he was bloody well right
carter turns to leave
keith continues crying and angry
you even screwed his wife didnt you
carter shuts the door leaving keith shouting after him
the poor bastard didnt even know if the kid was his
he falls back on to the bed crying out in pain
a wide road runs alongside the tyne
it passes below the vast steel bridges that link the two parts of the city
a carpark lies at the foot of the iron bridge
carter pulls up and parks
he gets out and moves quickly
the bridge is a massive structure
the traffic lanes are flanked each side by pedestrian walkways
it is here that carter and margaret have arranged to meet
how were things between you and frank
he was all right to me
just another feller
nicer than most
but he was just another feller wasnt he
though nicer than most
i cant help the way i am
ignoring the statement whyd you see him so regular
once a week
i call that regular
he was gentlemanly
i like that
once a week you like a gentleman
angrily look im me right
we are what we are like it or not
she turns and walks slowly along the bridge
why all the bloody needle
what was bugging frank
he wanted me to leave dave and marry him
last friday i told him it wouldnt work
dave would have killed us both
pause he followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street pause i had to tell frank i couldnt see him any more
it was getting too dodgy
that was on sunday
she stops and looks over the bridge
he said hed kill himself
i was frightened what you might do
they look at each other for a moment
carter shakes his head
he gently takes the sunglasses from margarets face and folds them up
i dont believe you margaret
frank wasnt like that
pause im the villain in the family remember
its the truth
carter snaps her glasses in two and throws them away
shouting you bloody whore
frank was too careful to die like that
who killed him
i dont know nothing
carter holds her arm
she winces like shes been hit before
listen the only reason i came back to this craphole was to find out who did it
and i wont leave until i do
behind carter peters jaguar comes slowly along the bridge
the passenger side is a gaping hole
carter swings round to see them then swings angrily back to margaret
it was you who told them i was here wasnt it
he smacks her hard across the face
margaret cries out
the car draws alongside
a steel mesh separates the pedestrian way from the traffic so the two men cant get to carter until he reaches the end of the bridge
con leans out his usual cheery self
peters very upset about his car
hes going to shit all over you
ill catch up with you later margaret
and with that he vaults over the handrail on to a corrugated roof
con jumps out of the jaguar
shouts above the revs come on get in
con does and they race off
carter arrives at the top of some narrow steep overgrown steps leading down to the river road where his car is parked
he leaps down the steps as the jaguar screeches to a halt at the top
con leaps out of the jaguar and gives chase
peter backs the jaguar and roars off
carter comes running down the steps with con not far behind
he arrives at the river road
in the distance he can see his parked car
as he nears the car park peters jaguar comes down the hill
its going to cut carter off from his car
a sunbeam alpine sports car waits there
its engine roars into life and it races out of the car park
it reaches him just before the jaguar and slows down
over here jack
carter sees that the driver is glenda
the hood is down so he vaults into the car as it accelerates off
the sunbeam swings round narrowly missing the oncoming jaguar and roars away
peter hasnt a chance
hes facing the wrong way and has little room to manoeuvre
glenda laughs as the car swings wildly around a corner at the top of the hill
every movement glenda makes is sexually charged manual gear changes steering even braking
carter cant take his eyes off her
you didnt know you had a fairy godmother did you
i didnt know that
a fairy godmother all of your own
arent you lucky
so where are we going princess
to the demon kings castle of course
the car screams off the road into a multi storey carpark
glenda really puts her foot down
the car hurtles around each deserted floor
howd you know where id be
you were seen parking your car
the demon king waves his wand and i was dispatched to bring you to him
lucky for you i waited
very lucky i should think
he must have been pretty sure id come
oh he was
he told me a magic spell that would make you come
smiling and what was that
were there now
she brakes to a split second stop
its one large empty concrete box with big picture windows all the way round
wires are hanging from the ceiling and walls where the lights will eventually be fixed
a tall figure stands at the opposite end facing the setting sun
he is just a silhouette
carter and glenda enter and walk towards the man
the silhouette turns as he nears it
a new venture of mine
its going to be a restaurant
pause do you like it
last night after youd gone i did a little bit of asking around
seeing as you werent very forthcoming pause it seems that you are concerned about the death of your brother
pause i got to thinking it would be nice if the bloke you were after was the same bloke i wanted off my back pause you know my life
looks after itself
people put money in
i take it out
not much rough stuff
its a business that makes me very happy
but recently ive had a spot of bother pause one of my lads gets a bit over anxious and flogs some machines in a club thats already got some
the upshot is ive had to eat shit and stop flogging my machines to other clubs
pause so far as im concerned thats it
these people ive offended get the idea that it would be good to take over my whole outfit pause so im worried
i cant fight them i havent that kind of set up
but ive got to fix them before they fix me
trouble is if i try and they find out im dead
brumby picks up a black briefcase
he holds it up to carter
it belongs to you
along with a little name im going to give you
pause kinnear did it
i dont know
all i know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last saturday
your brothers name was mentioned
next day he was dead
i dont know
thats all i was told
carter takes a last look at glenda and walks slowly back towards the entrance
thats not good enough
shouting do me a favour
you dont really expect me to fix kinnear on your say so
pause just because they tried to get me on you last night dont think you can pull the same trick
jack youre wrong
good afternoon mr brumby
carter steps out of the elevator as glendas sunbeam comes down the bottom ramp fast
the car brakes hard and stops
carter opens the door and gets in
not a word is said
the apartment is one of many in a modern block and glenda has only recently moved in
there is a mattress on the floor
a large mirror leans against the wall behind it and a film projector stands close to the window which has makeshift curtains
carter and glenda are on the mattress
the bedding is all over the place
they have just finished fucking
looking around whos setting you up in this place
is he coming here
hes meeting the architects at the restaurant
carter plays with her hair
arent you scared kinnear will find out
he thinks im simple
carter kisses her neck
what does he want that bloody great country place for
what kind of entertaining
now youre asking
carter looks at the film projector by the bed and points
does brumby get a kick out of that crap
giggling especially when i play the lead
carter wraps his arms about her
did kinnear say anything
after id left the other night
glenda sits up sharply
thats why you waited for me
kissing her on the neck not entirely
you sure about that
sure im sure
glenda pushes him away and gets out of the bed
glenda leaves for the bathroom
carter curious looks at the film projector
he switches it on
a beam of light hits the opposite wall
he settles down to watch the film
the leader flashes by then a title being chalked on a school blackboard the teachers pet
a zoom back reveals glenda bare breasted holding the chalk
this is followed by a long shot of a young girl dressed in school uniform waiting at a bus stop
a car approaches and stops
a woman driver offers the girl a lift
the woman is margaret
the identity of the girl not revealed
glenda is in the bath
lots of foam
the hot water is still running
she leans forward turning off the tap
carter is sitting up on the mattress amused by the soft porn unfolding on the white wall in front of him
the schoolgirl accepts the lift and the car drives off
the door to an anonymous apartment opens and margaret comes in with the girl
her school hat still hides her identity
glenda is there to greet them
the girl is very awkward
glenda tries to make her relax sitting her down and showing her a magazine
glenda brings her into a bedroom
she takes her own top off and goes to do the same with the girl
she takes her hat off
a close up shows that it is doreen
carter tenses but never flinches from whats happening in the film
margaret comes into the bedroom and feigns shock at what she sees
she slaps glenda and they start fighting eventually rolling off the bed
the apartment door opens and a man smoking a big cigar comes in
carter sits up
its albert swift
albert opens another door looking for someone
another door opens and hes in the bedroom
he sees the two women fighting on the floor but on the bed is his prize doreen
doreen bites her nails and looks terrified
reflected in the mirror behind carter is the image of albert taking off his trousers
the reel runs out and flaps like a fish
carter doesnt move
tears form in his eyes
he looks old and defeated
his is a wasted life
then the anger that drives him explodes again and he throws back the bedclothes
carter now dressed moves slowly towards her in the bath
i want to give you an oscar
laughs youve been watching the film
tell me about the girl
the young girl
who pulled her
i dont know
was it albert
shouldnt think so
is it one of kinnears films
who set it up
then he must have pulled her
did my brother frank find out
what you talking about
carters fury bursts
hes out of control
he seizes glenda and plunges her under the bathwater holding her there
youre a lying bitch
carter lifts her up out of the water
she is spluttering nearly drowned
now tell me the truth
the girls name was doreen
thats all i know
and you didnt know her last name
well its carter
thats my name pause and her father was my brother
and he was murdered last sunday
now get up and get dressed
he pushes her ahead of him
carter manhandles glenda towards her sunbeam
he opens the boot
glenda climbs in and he slams the boot shut
the car scorches away
carter parks the sports car as the ferry docks
he moves down the gangway towards it
a girl with a baby in a pram is having a cup of tea
the door slams open
the girl is numb with fear unable to answer
carter grabs her by the throat
the girl is frozen with terror
he lets go as suddenly as he grabbed her
i know where ill find him
carter walks fast
theres the sound of a phone being dialled
its the girl in the cafe
eric hes come for albert pause i dont know pause on the ferry i reckon
carter reaches the front of a betting shop
he walks in
carter closes the door
race results and odds are coming over the tannoy
he moves into the shop until he reaches albert swift
albert is making out a betting slip and doesnt see him
albert looks like hes going to be sick
hello jack snivelling i dont know anything jack
yes you do albert
talk or ill kill you
carter sees a door at the back
theres a sign for the toilets
do you want to go to the toilet albert
at first albert doesnt understand
do you want to go to the toilet albert
this time it clicks
albert moves to the door and carter follows
carter turns to close the door
albert runs for it
he reaches the high double gate at the end
its locked and he tries to climb it
carter easily pulls him down
albert faces him
you cant get away from me albert
he feels for his cigarettes but cant find them
for christs sake give us a fag
carter takes out his cigarettes
albert takes one
i didnt know who doreen was
thought she was just another bird
did eric pake pull her
hes got his ways
he knows margaret
when did you find out
a couple of weeks back
i had a visit from somebody
hed seen the film
he wanted to meet doreen
and you told brumby
who killed frank
albert doesn t answer
do you want to be dead albert
last sunday afternoon eric and two of his boys arrive with frank and tell me that hes rumbled
somehow hes seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off
they ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat
pause i thought theyd just duff him up a bit
what did you do
what could i do
did eric know that frank was my brother
i told him
what did he say
albert draws deeply on his cigarette
they drove frank away in a car
is that all there is
then thats it albert
carter takes something from his pocket
theres a loud click
jack for christs sake
he falls to his knees
you knew what id do
crying yes but listen
christ i didnt kill him
carter drives the knife into him with all his might
i know you didnt kill him
i know you didnt
a ships horn calls mournfully from the harbour
albert leans back
blood seeps from his chest
he pitches forward twitches and is dead
carter comes in from the back and walks calmly through to the street
a blind man is at the counter placing a bet
the sunbeam waits in the car park
eric con and peter arrive in the land rover and park behind it
they go down the gangplank to the floating jetty
a ferry is chugging across the water
carter sits watching the other passengers
a mother and two young children take his attention
his look is tinted with regret even remorse
as the ferry comes alongside eric con and peter move up to the rail
the passengers disembark leaving carter standing alone
hes holding cons handgun
eric con and peter hack slowly away to the steel shelters
peter impatient as ever pulls a sawn off automatic shooter from under his coat cocks it and fires
carter is already safely behind the ferrys superstructure
cyril said no shooters you stupid bastard
gerald wants to see him first
carter is listening to all this
shouting are you coming in
or do we piss about all day
youre finished jack
you know that dont you
ive bloody finished you
not till im dead eric
oh youve still got your sense of humour
tell him how ive fixed him con
hes told gerald about you and anna
didnt believe us at first did he con
then peter talked to him
didnt even say goodbye
just asked us to take you back alive
hes probably talking to her right now
are you still going to fancy her when geralds finished with her face
carter shows no emotion
or are his eyes just that bit sadder
peter lets rip again
another window is shattered
carter ducks back allowing peter time to board the ferry
carter catches a glimpse of peter as he climbs up the ferrys superstructure to the roof
by the time he heaves himself into position carter is waiting
stay where you are peter
peter is helpless clinging to the roof unable to even raise his shooter
theres a long pause while carter looks at him then he cold bloodedly shoots
peter is blown away
by the time he hits the deck hes dead
con and eric panic
they run up the gangplank safely out of range
carter your car needs a wash
eric signals to the driver in the land rover to bump the sunbeam into the water
two hits and the task is done
glendas screams are lost as the river wraps itself around the sinking car
carter watches impassively
carters hire car corners at speed into the high rise carpark
brumby and two architects in a site meeting
plans are laid out on a table
i dont want them cooking in here
you can put a hatch in that wall
yes its all a question of
the sound of a car screeching up the ramps interrupts him
who in christs name is that
its a bloody madman
he strides away to investigate
brumby comes out to the top tier
on the floor below carter unseen by brumby has parked and is now making for the concrete spiral staircase
brumby pounds down to the first level
carter comes around the corner
carter slams his fist hard into his gut
you shouldnt have shown the film to frank
i had to
it was the only way i could get at them
its a combined shop and post office
carter is on the phone
the guy on the swing bridge
pause carter hangs up
he takes a can of film from his pocket and slips it into a large envelope
at the counter two women are talking
they dont know how it happened
how far did he fall
what did betty say
ninety floors i think it was
was he dead
the envelope is passed across to the post office assistant
it is addressed to vice squad scotland yard london sw
better to go quick like that
the huge steel superstructure pivots on a large man made island in the middle of the river
on top is a structure not unlike a small lighthouse from which a man operates the bridge
carter climbs the outside ladder
a man waits for him at the top
the man hands him a small cloth package
carter opens it
inside is heroin and a hypodermic
he wraps it up again and hands over an envelope
the man checks the money as carter disappears down the outside ladder
the hall is crowded
the compere calls the numbers
the atmosphere is tense as the audience look at their cards
someone calls bingo
a buzz goes round the hall as everybody starts talking again
carter enters surveying the audience
eventually his eyes alight on the person hes been looking for margaret
shes involved with a woman friend and doesnt see him
the next game starts up
crowds of people come pouring out
its the end of the evenings entertainment
margaret walks out with her friend
carter follows them and turns up a side street
the place is deserted
margaret and her friend descend the steps
the clop of their high heels is the only sound
carter follows discreetly
at the bottom margaret and her friend chat for a moment and part
carter follows margaret
the clop of margarets shoes is heard in the distance
carter is following behind
he slips into another dark alley to get ahead of her
as she reaches her home carters arm shoots out from behind a pillar
its holding cons handgun
ive come for you margaret
theres a big party going on
the music is loud
its mainly rich looking middle aged men and young dolly birds
different things are obviously going on in different rooms in the house
dancing in one room blue movies in another etc
kinnear flits from one to another
eric paice is on the phone
he puts the receiver down and crosses to kinnear
gerald fletcher wants a word with you cyril
kinnear crosses to the telephone
carter stands in the dimly lit kiosk with margaret
the hire car is parked alongside
listen carefully you hairy faced git
ive got the film and enough evidence to put you away for a long time
all it takes is one call to the police
carter into phone
ill do a simple deal with you
all i want is
kinnear is still listening to carter
he looks over at eric whos fixing a drink
i think that can be arranged
kinnear continues listening
carter into phone
but i dont want him there until six in the morning
carter hangs up
he pushes margaret towards the car
the noise of the wild party is heard off
eric comes into the room
you want something cyril
a word with you
headlights through the thick trees as carters car comes bouncing over rough ground
carter stops in a clearing and leaves his headlights on
he turns to margaret
carter and margaret get out
they appear in the beam of the headlights and move further into the wood
carter and margaret stop
take your clothes off
margaret is confused
take your clothes off
margaret does just that coat blouse skin
she goes to remove her knickers
keep your pants on
pause lie down
again she obeys
he kneels on her pinning her arms with his knees then stuffs a gag in her mouth
he takes out the hypodermic places it against her arm and injects the heroin into her
she struggles her eyes moving frantically about
she screams but its muffled by the gag
carter holds her down and she quickly goes under
carter removes the gag
he stands picks her up and walks into the darkness with margaret in his arms
kinnear is alone speaking on the telephone quietly
the party is still going on
i want you to listen very carefully
jack carter pause you know what he looks like
a bedside light is on
a man in bed is listening on the phone
he taps his cigarette against the ashtray
on his middle finger is a large ring with the initial j on it
he listens until the line goes dead
the woman beside him stirs
he stubs out the cigarette and switches off the light
eric comes out of the front door
inside the party is still in progress
he gets into a cadillac and drives off
carter is parked where he can see the drive up to kinnears house
the cadillac appears and swings on to the road
theres the sound of a phone being dialled
a long line of police cars move slowly up the drive followed by a police bus
they park by the front door and around fifty policemen pour out
they move silently around the building
a chief constable opens the front door and walks in
the police move through the house and grounds
in the bedrooms they find groups of people in bed together
the men in particular protest and are obviously concerned about being identified
the police find evidence of drugs pornography and so on
outside police are combing the grounds
in the long grass leading down to the lake they find womens clothes
they follow the trail until they discover a woman floating naked face downwards in the lake
a policeman with waders goes in and pulls her to the side
as others heave her out we see that its margaret
the house is surrounded by police measuring and photographing and outside the house are police cars and ambulances
the lawn is crowded with the party crowd
in the early morning light they look like dolls
kinnear comes out of the front door with two plain clothes officers and gets in a police car
sirens going it comes down the short drive to the gate
carter is driving along a coast road
the sea and a wide beach lie on his right
long rows of houses are to his left
the sun is still low
its very quiet
he arrives at a harbour and drives on until he reaches the end of a vast wooden jetty running out into the estuary
its a coal loader for tankers
this jetty is very high a complex of wooden staves and pillars interwoven with steps and gangways
on its top tier is a complex of railway lines signals and black coal chutes
carter parks his car and picks up the shotgun and a bottle of scotch off the back seat
he get out and walks over to the jetty and along a lower gangway
at the far end a man is standing
its eric paice
eric turns around abruptly
he sees carter and disappears up the nearest stairway
at the top he stops to listen but can see and hear only the harbour waters lapping below
carter looks back to the coal jetty just in time to see eric scamper down to the level below
eric sprints for the roadway
carter waits and then starts running directly above him
eric keeps running
carter stays always overhead
hes playing cat and mouse with eric
calling out you couldnt win an egg and spoon race eric
wheezing sod off
paice darts down another staircase to ground level and makes for the roadway
carter stops above the roadway
below paice makes for the parked car
carter holds the gun up
eric stops and looks up
stay away from the car or ill blow you apart
eric darts under the jetty
carter runs on down the steps
he can see eric scampering along the row of cottages towards the beach
carter starts after him
eric runs out on to the beach
the only sounds are his feet pounding the pebbles and his hurtful panting
in the distance factory chimneys belch out smoke
for a moment he watches eric stumbling along at the far end of the beach
he climbs down to the beach and starts running
carter is gaining on eric rapidly
eric looks round and panics
he stumbles and falls over
he gets to his feet quickly and disappears round the headland
on the other side of the headland the scene is extraordinary
the deserted beach is like the edge of the world
the sand is black as far as the eye can see
its littered with rubbish
several old lorries are sunk deep in the sand
high grass covered cliffs flank it on the left
in the distance a continuous line of giant black buckets move like cable cars out to sea before they deposit their load of coal slag and move inland again
the coal mine itself is inland hidden away behind the cliffs
the sea like the sand is black as it crashes on to the shore
eric is half way along the beach struggling in the mud
carter closes on him
eric nears the line of buckets and cuts inland towards the mine
carter has nearly caught up
the buckets grind and crash as they move along the cable
eric scrambles up the narrow valley down which the coal slag travels
he is panting horribly
carter is close on his heels
near the top where the buckets are practically at ground level eric stumbles and falls
he is too exhausted to get up
carter stands over him
panting slightly stand up eric
eric just manages it
carter pulls the bottle of scotch out of his pocket
i bet you could use a drink could you eric
he throws the bottle to eric
have a drink
still got your sense of humour
eric takes the cap off and looks at carter
hes in a terrible state
drink up eric
i want you to drink all of that
do you understand
just like it was with my brother frank
go on son
eric pours the whisky into his month
it spills over and runs down his face
drink up eric
eric begins to stagger about
it was you who poured it down him
eric takes a breather and looks pathetically at carter
no mercy there
did you all have a good laugh eh
did you have a good laugh when he was spewing it up
the whisky is pouring all over erics face and suit
its disgusting to watch
suddenly he retches but nothing comes up
did you all pass the bottle round after the car went over the top
eric is choking
dont stop eric
carter leans forward and with his free hand lifts the bottle up to erics mouth again
in the other he holds the shotgun
eric chokes and retches
carter has seen enough
carter raises the butt of the gun and brings it down on erics head
erics body loaded on to a a coal bucket moves off on its final journey
carter laughing walks beside it gun riding on his shoulder
the bucket shudders and grinds as it moves along the cable
erics body moves of on its final journey
it reaches the end of the line where an automatic catch tilts it
erics body drops into the sea
the coal slag follows in a cloud of black dust
the waves pass over and everything is gone
carter stands for a moment turns and walks back along the beach
he stops looks at the shotgun and decides to get rid of it
below carter moves slowly by the edge of the sea
he raises the shotgun to throw it away
high on the clifftop a rifle and telescopic lens line up on carter
a finger curls around the trigger
on the middle finger of the same hand is a large gold ring with the letter j engraved upon it
it is the man kinnear contacted after sending eric to his death
the finger tightens on the trigger and pulls it
theres a quiet whooshing sound
carter drops to the ground
carter lies on the beach
the waves lap around his head
a small trickle of blood pours out of a hole in his temple
kinnears hit man coolly dismantles his rifle
he carefully wraps it in a cloth fishing rod carrier
he walks off and is soon lost as he drops out of sight
