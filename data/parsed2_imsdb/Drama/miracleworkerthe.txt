written by william gibson july th a night
we see three faces in lamplight looking down
they have been through a long vigil and it shows in their tired eyes and disarranged clothing
one is a young gentlewoman with a sweet girlish face kate keller the second is an elderly doctor stethoscope at neck thermometer in fingers the third is a gruff gentleman
in his forties with chin whis kers captain arthur keller
kate closes her eyes
i can tell you now i thought she wouldnt ive brought up two of them but this is my wifes first she isnt battle scarred yet
will my girl be all right
oh by morning shell be knocking down captain kellerfs fences again
is there nothing we should do
put up stronger fencing ha
just let her get well she knows how to do it better than we do
these things come and go in infants never know why
call it acute congestion of the stomach and brain
moves after the doctor we hear them off camera we see only kates face hovering over us her hand adjust ing the blanket
ill see you to your buggy doctor
main thing is the fevers gone
ive never seen a baby more vitality thats the truth their voices and footsteps fade
kate is bent lovingly over the crib which emits a bleat her finger is play ful with the babys face
dont you cry now youve been trouble enough
call it acute congestion indeed i dont see whats so cute about a con gestion just because its yours
well have your father run an editorial in his paper the wonders of modern medicine they dont know what theyre curing even when they cure it
men men and their battle scars we women will have to helen helen captain captain will you come
she screams keller standing lamp in hand watching the doctors buggy recede in the night
suddenly from the house behind him comes a knifing scream
keller wheels the scream comes again and the camera follows kellers run with the lamp across the yard
keller runs into the house and up the dark stairs
keller bursts into the bedroom where kate is screaming at the crib her look intent on the baby and terrible
katie whats wrong
w u ued she makes a pass with her hand in the crib at the babys eyes
kate contd she cant see
look at her eyes
she takes the lamp from him moves it before the childs face
she cant seel helen
when i screamed she didnt blink
not an eyelash helen
heleni she cant hear youl his face has something like fury in it crying the childs name kate almost fainting presses her knuckles to her mouth to stop her own
the stairs in the keller house
in the foreground we see the bannisters in the background the wall
of the erratic staggering figure of year old helen appears on the wall moving slowly
the two negro children scamper past their excited laughter coming to us in contrast to the mute helen
in cu in the fg helens little hands come into the frame grasping the bannister rail
high long shot lookin down on lines of bed sheets hung up in the keller yard to dry
it appears to be a kind of maze the sheets blowing in the wind and staggering among them is the figure of the child helen years old reach ing out
struggling buffeted by the damp blowing sheets crane down towards the figure
helen lashes out her face frightened unknowing she pulls down a sheet be comes tangled in its folds almost hysterical
in the bg kate comes rushing from the house to help her
there is a christmas tree with decorations and in a wide shot we see helen years old reaching up into tree
at a window we see the faces of percy years and martha years looking in
helenrs hand gets a christmas ball and rips it down shattering at her feet
crab in and around coming to the side of the tree seeing helents hands another ball she pulls it down
we see her face blurred out through the pine branches and needles and beyond her the other children watching
a wide high shot
we see the lonely expanse of field with a low grass sprouting up in the bg is the keller house perhaps
going slowly across the field is the figure of the child helen patty duke
from in under camera comes kate following her
scene will be out mos up until ringing of bell now we are in leaf dappled sunlight in the keller yard on three kneeling children and an old dog around
v iney with jug on way to barn to get milk
the dog is a setter named belle and she is sleeping
two of the children are negroes martha and percy
the third child is helen quite unkempt in body a vivacious little person with a fine head attractive but noticeably blind one eye larger and protruding her gestures are abrupt
insistent lacking in human restraint and her face never smiles
she is flanked by the other two in a litter of paper doll cutouts and while they speak helens hands thrust at their faces in turn feeling baffledly at the
movements of their lips
the camera is on this the dialogue is only background
first itm gonna cut off this doe torts leg one two now then why you cuttin off that doctors legs
im gonna give him a operation
now im gonna cut off his arms one two
now im gonna fix up she pushes helens hand away from her mouth
you stop that
cut off his stomach thats a good operation
no im gonna cut off his head first he got a bad cold
aint gonna be much of that doc tor left to fix up time you finish all them opera but helen is poking her fingers inside his mouth to feel his
tongue he bites at them annoyed and she jerks them away
helen now fingers her own lips moving them in imitation but soundlessly
again the camera on this
what you do bite hand
thats how i do she keep pokint
her fingers in my mouth i just bite em off
that she tryin do now
she tryint talk
she gonna get read
looka her try in talk
illen is scowling the lips under her fingertips moving in silence growing more and more frantic until in a bizarre rage she bites at her own fingers
this sends percy off into laughter but alarms martha
hey you stop now
she pulls eelei s hand down you just sit quiet and but at once heleit topples ltartha on her back knees pinning her shoulders down and ravs the sissors
martha screams hile her tied b nchlets of hair f off in snips of the scissors
percy darts to the bell stria on the porch yanks it w the dell boa
livid rooli captain x ller is at work at his deal
ja es is at his ease in conversation with kate and aunt ev
kate is serving a cool refreshment
itar ringing of bell
kate rushes out the door followed more slowly by a mitt w leaving behind jails feller
five years have done much to her the girlish play fulness is gone she is a woman settled in grief
for the thousandth time helen
she is dorm the steps at once to them seizing ii lett s wrists and lifting her off iartha
vine runs in and chases martha and percy off
kat j c o t i d let me have those scissors sate reaches for the scissors in helen s hand
put hel n pulls the scissors baci
they stru g le for then a mno m
ent then kate gives up lets hele
she tries to drrrr helen into the house

iiii len s whole body now beco nnes ea er she surrenders the scissors kate t

pt in ke
l r in spectacles is working over netrs paper pages at a corner desk a benign am t ev wearing a hat with a sew in
basket on a sofa is put tin the finishing stitches on a big shapeless doll made out of towels an ineol ont young man of i te s are ja
s c tr turns from the window to look at h e l n
i le halts her hands alert to grope and e kate turns her to the aunt who gives her the doll the aunt is meanwhile speaking to teller
arthur something ought to be done for that child
a refresh ng suggg estion
thy this ver t famous perkins school in poston theyre just supposed to do wonders
the childs been to speci lists everywhere
the couldnt help her in baltimore or aslaington could they
tiin the cap ain will write to the perkins school soon
ratie howe many tines can you let then brew
any number of tines h t e foreroinz and follovrin dialo ue is peripheral to the we are on el t she sits on the or to explore the doll
t th h
r fingers gravely and her hand pauses over the face this is no face a blan area and it troubles her
clos up on her finger tips searching for flaatures
she tans ouestioninsly fo eyes but no one notices
she then yanks at her jflt s dress and taps amain viforousry for eyes
c o t
i icj n what child
obviously not hearing helen commences to go around from person to person tapping her eyes but no one attends or understands
no break as long as theres the least chance
for her to see
or hear or there isntt
now i must finish here
i think with your permission captain id like to write to the perkins school
i said no katie
why writing does no harm arthur only a little bitty letter
to see if they can help her
we wont know that to be a fact captain until afller you write
helen now is groping among thing
on fell er t s desk and katie
kate quickly turns helen away and retrives the papers
i might as well tay to work in a henyard as in th
s house you really ought to put her away father
staring up what
its the kindest thing
why shes your sister james not a nobody half sister and half mentally defective she cant even keep herself clean
its not pleasant to see her about all the time
do you dare
complain of what you can see
very annoyed this discussion is at an end helen gropes her way with the doll back to aunt ev
the house is at sixes and sevens from morning til night over the childl i want some peace here i dont care how but one way we wont have it
is by rushing up and down the country every time someone hears of a new quack
im as sensible to this affliction as fingering her dress yanks two buttons from it
helena my buttons
helen pushes the buttons into the dolls face
kate now sees comes swiftly to kneel lifts helens hand to her own eyes in question
helen nods energetically
she wants the doll to have eyes
another kind of silence now while kate takes pins and buttons from the sewing basket and attaches them to the doll as eyes
keller stands caught and watches morosely aunt ev blinks and conceals her emotion by inspecting her dress
my goodness me im not decent
she doesnt know better aunt ev
ill sew them on again
its worth a couple of buttons kate look
helen now has the doll with eyes and cannot contain herself for joy she rocks the doll pats it vigorously kisses it
this child has more sense than all these men kellers if theres ever any way to reach that mind of hers
the swaddled baby tumbles out and captain keller barely manages to dive and catch it in time
all are in commotion the baby screams but helen un perturbed is lying her doll in its place kate on her knees pulls her hands off the cradle wringing them
helen is bewildered
helen helen youre not to do such things how can i make you hoarsely handing the baby to aunt ev katie
how can i get it into your head my darling my poor katie some way of teaching her an iota of discipline has to be how can you discipline an
is it her fault
helens fingers have fluttered to her mothers lips vainly trying to comprehend their movements we are close on these two
i didnt say it was her fault
i dont know what to dot how can i teach her beat her until shes black and blue
its not safe to let her run around loose
now there must be a way of confining her somehow so she cant where in a cage
shes a growing child she has to use her limbs
answer me one thing is it fair to mildred here
are you willing to put her away
now helens face darkens in the same rage as at herself earlier and her hand strikes at kates lips
kate catches her again and helen begins to kick struggle twist
she wants to talk like be like you and me
she holds helen struggling until we hear from the child her first sound so far an inarticulate weird noise in her throat such as an animal in a trap might
make and kate releases her
the second she is free helen blunders away collides violently with a chair falls and sits weeping
kate comes to her embraces caresses soothes her and buries her own face in her hair until she can control her voice
every day she slips further away
i dont know how to call her back
oh ive a mind to write to boston myself
if that school cant help her maybe theyll know somebody who can
presently heavily ill write to perkins katie
he stands with the baby in his clasp staring at helens head hanging down on kates arm
anagnos on platform with annies suitcase is reach ing up to help annie mount steps
camera is behind only that a suitable governess has been found here and will come
it will no doubt be difficult for you there annie but it has been difficult for you at our school too hmmm
this is my last time to counsel you annie and you do lack some by some i mean all what tact or talent to benct
and what has saved you on one or more occasions at perkins is that there was nowhere to expel you to
above annieis seat anagnos puts her suitcase looking down at her
your eyes hurt
my ears mr
nowhere but back to that dreadful place where children learn to be saucy
annie i know how unhappy it was there but that battle is dead and done with
why not let it stay buried
i think god must owe me a resur rection
a bit shocked what
well he keeps digging up that battle
that is not a proper thing to say
annie be humble
he extends a gift to her
youll need their affection work ing with this child
annie not quite comprehending looks at gift
a gift with our affection
annie opens a small box and sees a garnet ring
she looks up blinking then down
anagnos her voice is trembling but she swallows over getting the ring on her finger and cannot continue until she finds a woebegone joke
well what should i say im an ignorant opinionated girl and everything i am i owe to you
that is only half true annie
the train lurches
anagnos bends and kisses her on the cheek and says goodbye
she calls after him i wont give them any trouble
ill be so ladylike they wont notice ive come
passengers behind annie turn reacting to her shout
she is conscious of this and sinks downin seat
past annie through window of train we see anagnos join or blind girls on the platform and the train departs
suddenly train rushes into a tunnel and darkness comes over the scene
where are we going annie
where are we going
i said im taking care of you
where we go
young jimmie and young annie are standing in front of desk
we do not see man sitting behind desk but we hear his voice
al s voice annie sullivan aged nine virtually blind jaynes sullivan aged seven whats the matter with your legs sonny
its his hip n ster he was born that way

the girl shakes her head
