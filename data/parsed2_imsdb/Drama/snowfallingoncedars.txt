snow falling on cedars early by ronald bass ronald bass first draft screenplay march fog
penetrated only by sound
the lapping of sea at a drifting hull
tendrils of mist part revealing
strong and blond and handsome
from below we watch carl heine high on the cross spar of his mast
he has pulled a shuttle of twine from his rubber overalls and is lashing a lantern in the cloud of mist as main angle
the tiny meticulously neat cabin
a tin coffee cup on the counters edge
the battery well open revealing two large batteries in place
the deck of this sturdy stern picker
the fishing net stretched from the huge drum into the sea
keep panning to the bow where
carl stands with his kerosene lantern and his air horn watching as another boat comes slowly out of the mist
the silhouette of a fisherman holding a long fishing gaff
as fragments of fog part we close on the figures face to see
they are asian
smash cut to
our boat bobs lifeless on placid water
as credits continue two figures slowly reel in the massive net
sheriff art moran is painfully thin unimposing methodical
only the eyes reflect his disquiet
his young deputy abel martinson cuts anxious looks between his mentor and the sea
as the net brings silvered salmon across the gunnel cut to
tidy as before
only two things have changed
close on the tin coffee cup which now lies overturned on the floor
pan above the open battery well where a third marine battery now stands next to the wheel
the stern as the raveling net lifts from the waters surface
the face of carl heine
turned to the sun
smash cut to
white fills the frame
a hand pulls back the blanket shroud revealing carls face
as credits continue tilt up to the coroner horace whaley gazing down
a shading of regret behind the professional mask
a series of quick cuts
whaleys hand pulls the shuttle of twine from carls pocket
examines the open empty knife sheath at carls belt
carls wrist its watch stopped at
whaley bends over carls body presses on his solar plexus watching pink foam rise from carls mouth and nose
he sees something more
his fingers gently pull back the hair from above carls left ear to reveal
a skull wound
the bone caved in
four inches across
snow falling on cedars
the heavens descend softly onto our island
exquisite silent hypnotic
an epic snowfall inspiring awe at our frailness against the limitless scope of nature
as credits conclude a series of cars pirouetting skating on their tires past an abandoned school bus where kids throw snowballs at is windows
fisks hardware center its endless queue of orderly citizens waiting stoically for their snow shovels and kerosene
the harbor with its moored fleet of tiny fishing vessels blanketed as if by volcanic ash a pair of teenage lovers building a snowman at the edge of a dock
she pushes the boy into the water and he rises laughing steam rising from his clothes
undulating strawberry fields of pure white untouched and flawless as the sahara
finally to a public building cars gathering as best they can people streaming up snow laden steps to the entrance and as we follow them smash cut to
close on impassive eyes
they are asian
we have seen them before
pull back to see
early s dark blue suit clean shirt
he sits ramrod straight utterly motionless expressionless the eye of a storm of movement in
the assembling courtroom
a packed gallery of buzzing locals the scent of anticipation
a bank of reporters and photographers cosmopolitan in attire bearing themselves as jaded dignitaries from the civilized world
as we pan their ranks
it was the first murder trial on the island in thirty one years
we look over the right shoulder of ishmael chambers early s dark a rugged somber man jotting notes on a pad which rests on his right leg
our only newspaper was the san piedro review a four page weekly that i operated alone
he glances blandly at his nonchalant colleagues
what i wondered could the seattle boys know of the hearts of these people
to the jury box
truck farmers grocers fishermen in sober neckties
a waitress a secretary fisher wives in sunday dresses
neighbors sitting in judgement
on their neighbor
to the neighbor
the ramrod still defendant
kabuo miaymoto sat with the rigid grace of a samurai warrior
as if detached from his own trial
ishmael writing on the pad balanced precariously on his knee until
did he know how dangerous his demeanor could be
with this jury
it falls with a clatter of pages
he reaches with his right hand replaces the pad on his thigh
around him cameras are being swung to the ready
ishmael looks to see
a slender woman of refined beauty entering the courtroom
a few flashes pop and ishmaels right hand retrieves a venerable box camera from beneath his seat as his notepad falls once more unheeded
hatsue miyamoto had been without her husband for days
ishmael pivots and we understand his struggle with the notepad
for he is forced to rest his camera on the stump of his amputated left arm its empty sleeve pinned at the elbow
he was in jail
when his baby son learned to walk
through his viewfinder we see hatsue take her place in the first row
and sensing her presence her husband turns
their eyes meet
a string of flashes
but none from ishmael
as if considering whether he will violate this womans privacy
the camera lowers
hold on his face
match cut to hatsues face
staring impassive empty
pull back to see that she sits alone on a wooden bench by the courtroom door
her hands rest delicately on the purse in her lap
her demeanor as removed from this place as is her husbands
earlier i noticed her in the corridor
pull back to see him alone in shadow
it is more than a notice
ishmael stares with fixed intensity at the motionless woman as she gathers her thoughts
a moment of decision
stops respectfully at a distance which will not invade her personal space
and softer than we might have imagined
are you all right
she turns her head only slightly
it is enough
her voice quiet and firm at once
go away ishmael
there is no anger
only directness and resolve
please dont be like th
hatsue softer go away
pan the back of the courtroom
twenty four citizens of japanese ancestry fill the last row dressed in their most formal clothes
shades of atticus finch
as one the japanese americans watch
the prosecutor alvin hooks a crisp even dapper man
there is a quickness about the eyes a tendency to sharpness of manner that he works carefully against
four inch gash skull crushed and your thought was what
judge fielding tall and gray and rawboned leans on his elbows his eyelids droop slightly a deceptive masking of keen attention
hit his head on the gunnel going over
the witness is sheriff moran
he answers as if this were a sincere question
as if he had never heard it before
well carl was six four went
he was a grizzly bear and an able seaman
thinking on that
for him to just
crush his skull like that on the way in
hold on ishmael
teenage boys in football uniforms
they ride with their helmets in their laps
he was a mountain all right
anchored the line for us little fellers
close on carl and ishmael at riding together
ishmael dark and rugged even then is scarcely little
but dwarfed by the blond giant at his side who glares out the window at
ysee the geese
snow geese landing in low flooded wheat
the grace of it holds both boys
pictured be nice
in your pas paper
ishmael nods absently
they stare side by side
lucky i got the camera in my helmet
they never look at each other
they never smile
but you can almost hear one in
that was almost a joke
hooks now stands with his polished shoe up on the witness podium
like chatting with the sheriff across the back fence
and you werent there when the coroner examined the wound
id gone to tell the wid
to tell mrs
and his glance inevitably goes to the first row behind the prosecutors table
taking the glances of the jury with it
susan marie heine is pretty and blonde and full bodied in her modest black dress
composure and dignity
against her grief
moran climbs from his vehicle as carls young sons dash around the corner of the house
seeing the sheriff they stop cold
silent shirtless barefoot
hey there men
is your mother home a tall
he spits his juicy fruit into a wrapper
and as the younger boy nods across the distance
sheriff moran hullo
she has appeared in the doorway smiling spittle marked babys diaper across her shoulder
and he smiles back
tells the boys
you go on and play now
but they dont
so he follows into her entryway closing the door behind him
and at the foot of her curving staircase
what can i do for you sheriff carls not home y
he stops himself
and she sees that
its why im here
im afraid i have some
very bad news to tell you the
kind of news
she looks at him uncomprehending the smile only beginning to fade before
carl died last night
in a fishing accident
in white sand bay
she only blinks
as if translating the words from a foreign language
no carls fine h
we found him mrs
tangled in his net
and with these words a slack blank look crosses her face and she stumbles back one step sitting down hard on the bottom stair of her curved staircase
he doesnt know what to do
she digs her elbows into her lap and begins to rock very slowly wringing the diaper in her hands
her face is more terrible than tears
it is frightened
she murmurs to herself so that we can barely hear
i told him this could happen
close on hooks nodding
as if slowly digesting something in his mind
immediate suspicion no
general talk of enmity between the two
these are fishermen alvin
they dont talk at all to each other and less to me
ishmael walking down the sunlit wharf
purpose in his stride
a gill netter works through black nights with only himself to talk to
and learns to be silent
they were lonely men and products of geography
up ahead the susan marie has been brought to dock
moran stands chatting with a knot of six or seven fishermen
men who on occasion realized that they wished to speak but couldnt
as he arrives moran smiles a thin greeting
not happy to see him
of course neither is anyone else
figure youda heard by now
ishmael shakes his head in silent helplessness
william gjovaag a sunburned big bellied tattooed gill netter clamps on his damp cigar butt
you go fishing it happens
ishmael to moran you see susan marie
whats she going to do
gjovaag disgusted well what can she do
excuse me gjovaag
i dont need to excuse nothin
fuck you anyhow chambers
it is all good natured sort of
like the sheriff i did not work the sea and could never merit trust
sheriffs been askin which boats followed carl out last night
moran quickly only to see if somebody talked to him out th
so who talked to him
at each other
eye contact holds during
jan sorensen heavy danish so far we figured the guys who went to ship channel bank was jim ferry hardwell moulton miyamoto
gjovaag spits japs
all right look if you see these boys
never saw you so hard ass art
aint this just an accident
moran finds his eyes drifting to ishmaels
which are right there waiting
moran looks away
course it is but a mans dead william
i got to write my report
ishmael and moran walking alone back up the wharf
the sheriff is worried
im not gonna see some article about an investigation am i
ishmael quietly you want me to lie
no i wanna be off the damn record thats what i want
they keep walking
i mean if there is a killer why would you want him all alerted
someday need some cooperation from you on this thing
do i get it
and looks over
like the guy holding all the aces
moran fidgets on the stand
no sign of a struggle you say
see him now
nels gudmundsson attorney for kabuo miyamoto stands beside his impassive client
nels is blind in his left eye a little shaky
his body is winding down
well the coffee cup was layin right in the middle of the floor like i said
and with a fella so neat as carl that did seem peculiar
and nels begins to walk toward him
limping as he comes
as peculiar as a struggle between a pound man and an assailant strong enough to subdue him
that leaves only a single overturned cup in its wake
objection asking the witness to speculate
my gosh alvin was i supposed to object every time you did that
judge wearily thats quite enough horseplay nels why dont you act your age
if i did that your honor id be dead
some gentle laughter
judge fielding doesnt even bother to look annoyed
any more homely loveable tricks and youll be worse than that
theres an objection your h
and its overruled answer the question
if you can recall it
maybe the assailant straightened the cabin
and forgot the cup
in the middle
of the floor
nels nods to himself as if considering that
so that the jury will do the same
i think you testified all the lights were on
cabin mast net lights picking lights
yessir thered been real heavy fog
and yet you started the engine right up
with all those lights drawing all night the batteries had that much charge
did that strike you odd
didnt think about it at the time
so no it didnt strike me odd
does it now
you have to wonder
you have to wonder
and lets that sit
scratches his neck
you found three batteries you say
a d and d in the well
and a spare d on the cabin floor
now i did some measuring down at the chandlery
a d is one inch wider than a d
it would be too large for the deceaseds well
hes done some on the spot refit ting
you could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the d
but he had a spare d you said
why not use that
it was dead
we had it tested
maybe the d was the spare and he had to use it
maybe he carried a spare that was too large to fit
so hed have to bang out the flange to squeeze it in
no answer to that
the silence rests
sheriff how many batteries and what size did you find on defendants boat
two d s
thats the kind his well was fitted for
so the defendant went out fishing for the night with no spare battery hmmn
the d that was refitted into the deceaseds well
was it exactly the same brand and model as defendants
i believe so
now youve testified that the deceased was a heavy man and hard to bring out of the net
is it possible his head struck the transom or the stern gunnel or the net roller as you were bringing him in
i dont think so
he was heavy but we were real careful
but i dont remember him hitting anything anywhere
remember and clears his throat
operating this winch youd rarely operated before doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of pounds
is it possible possible that he struck his head after death
but not darn likely
nels turns to jury no further questions
and limps back to the defendants table
where kabuo miyamoto sits watching him
horace whaley the county coroner folds his stork like limbs uncomfortably
searching for the appearance of ease
so when the sheriff returned you showed him the injury to the deceaseds head
he said could it be somebody hit him
and i said you want to play sherlock holmes here
shakes his head with a wry disgusted smile
did you say more
i said that if i was playing sherlock holmes
id maybe look for a
with a bloody gun butt
a right handed fella to be precise
well i was a doctor in the jap theater in the war
i saw those kendo wounds many times
looked exactly like this one
could you tell me what kendo is
japanese stick fighting
theyre trained as kids yknow
to kill with sticks
and the prosecutors eyes drift to the defendant
so that the jurys will do the same
hold on kabuos regal bearing
his neutral mask
no further questions
mist of early light
two dark figures little more than silhouettes measuring each other with their lethal bokken staffs
we may think of luke skywalker and darth vader for one is a full grown man
the other eight years old
dialogue plays in subtitled japanese
hips stomach cut stomach muscles tighten as stroke advances
and strikes a fearsome blow which the child repels with startling proficiency
we can see zenhichis stony face now
if he is impressed by his son he does not show it
elbow soft or there is no follow through
you cut your bokken off from the power of your body unl
the boy lashes fiercely the man parrying each stroke with blinding ease
hips sink more
less weight on the heels so tha
the father has sent a blow in mid word flinging the child like a doll
the boy bounces up snatching his bokken into ready position
zenhichi very quiet zenshin
is constant awareness
the child has unleashed a blow at the left side of his fathers head
it has been blocked
the staffs rest against each other just above zenhichis ear
there is no anger in either warrior
that we can see
a little better
father and son sit on the ground eating a small meal
the sun has risen angling light across the undulating fields
they are alone in beauty
a long silence
dialogue in subtitled you can be good with the bokken
if you begin to concentrate
eyes on his food
as if alone as if speaking to himself
the boy darting glances unseen at his fathers profile
you must choose now kabuo
at eight years
if you want this
kabuo boldly want it
the father keeps eating
then speak quietly
so you may be heard
whaley stares down the end of his needle nose
the air of disdain of a man playing chess with an unworthy opponent
foam you found in the lungs
how does it get there
as i testified
it occurs when water mucus and air are mixed by respiration
i believe i said that
nels slightly confused but a drowned person cant breathe
of course not
the foam means that he went in breathing
thats why the autopsy report identifies drowning as the cause of death
meaning that he wasnt murdered first say on the deck of the boat and then thrown overboard
your report says death by drowning which means he went into the water alive and breathing
and the report is accurate
whaley bristles of course its accurate but
of course it is
now as to the head injury
you say made by an object narrow and flat
that is your inference correct
whaley really pissed its my job to infer thats what coroners do
you get hit with a crowbar or a ball peen hammer or fall off a motorcycle the injuries look different thats my area of expertise
he can be quiet now
the witness distracted from volunteering the opinions nels did not wish for
in your motorcycle example
those injuries are produced by the head being propelled against an object
rather than the reverse yes
can you tell whether an object moved against the head or the other way around
or would both look the same
so if his head struck something narrow and flat the gunnel of a boat a net roller a fairlead could that have
if the head was moving fast enough but i dont see how it could be
is it possible
sure anythings poss
is it fair to say that you do not know for certain which it was
i already said that b
and that you cant say for certain whether the head injury was sustained before or after death
for certain no
but you are certain that he died by drowning
for the third time yes
whaley is beyond frustrated
can i say something here
yes you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceaseds right hand
the report says recent origin
as much as hours before death
probably one or two hours
four at the most
are you absol
yes im sure
thank you horace
no more questions
horace wants to say more
doesnt immediately move
well take our luncheon recess
the gavel cracks onto the block
judge fielding stands to leave and the bailiff begins to usher the jury from its box
abel martinson the deputy stands near as kabuo rises
as he puts his hand gently on kabuos arm the defendant turns smoothly
to face a woman
standing at the rail
and beneath the courtroom buzz
how are the kids
the voice so colloquially american we are taken back
having envisioned kabuo as a silent samurai
they need their father
the look holds
abel increasingly uneasy
just a few more days
abel coughs look arts gonna want me t
kabuo ignoring him you look beautiful
abel grasps his arm
i look terrible
dont sit so straight like tojos soldier
the jury will be afraid of you
he thinks about that
abel tugs him
okay ill hide under the table from now on
that make you happy
and for the first time
and seems suddenly very american indeed
she stares back her heart in her eyes
abel tugs harder but he cant budge the defendant
im not going until you smile
but she doesnt
so his fades
one last look
and he lets abel lead him away
hold on her
watching him go
stars above a desert
pan barbed wire rows of dark barracks blurred by swirling dust to
a fragile tar paper structure its walls rippling pre cariously
and inside to see that it is
a makeshift sanctuary
candles offerings of fruit
a young couple together before a buddhist priest
kabuo and hatsue
a cramped ramshackle room
dust blowing through gaps in the flimsy beams
fujiko imada hangs the last of the woolen army blankets to divide the room in half as her four youngest daughters watch
we push through the blankets to the other side to see
standing at a window in their wedding clothes
slow and full
until she whispers into his ear
theyll hear everything
and her young husband turns
speaks to the curtain
kabuo loud there must be something good on the radio
his hands trace her body
kabuo louder wouldnt some music be nice
and in a moment
the music begins
a song that sent our boys off to war
and our young american prisoners
begin to undress each other
her slender fingers find the buttons of his shirt deftly undoing it as he kisses her face
he unclasps her dress
and as it falls from her shoulders falls to the floor we push into her eyes and
intercut her memory of
two year old children floating on the water
clinging to a wooden box with a glass bottom for fish watching
the girl is asian
the boy is not
see the yellow one
and the boy wriggles around leans over the box as if seeking a better view
and kisses the girl
full on her startled mouth
on their cot now
naked and hungry for each other
kabuo loud can the music be louder please
we cant hear so good in here
the girl laughs soundlessly
and as the music blares he has slid his body above hers
have you ever done this
a whisper back sure and strong
youre my only
and as he enters her
as she holds him close with all her strength
her lips breathe into his ear
hatsue watching her husband disappear through a door
rack focus to see across the way
a man stares at her
course we grew up together
hatsue at sits with an old woman who guides her silently exquisitely through the ritual of the tea ceremony
her mom had this mrs
shigemura come on wednesdays
teach her how to be japanese
the woman turns the cup in her hands
one quarter turn
bows slightly as she presents the tea
doing her hair
how to sit without moving
hatsue and ishmael both are sprawled on the ground sheltered in the hollowed out base of a cedar tree
they watch the rain as it pummels the woods around them
she is speaking carefully thoughtfully
he listens with complete attention
she would tell me stories of this woman and her lessons
as if complaining or at least ex plaining her world
he shifts his position his body brushing against hers which makes him reflexively pull away
she seems not to notice
but i always fantasized
the lessons were for me
hatsue sits at a bedroom mirror
shigemura watching analytically as hatsue weaves her hair into a thick plait
you must never look at a man directly
this is part of grace
the girl smiles a small sour smile
i dont think the boys on this island
the old woman studies her without irritation
hakujin know nothing of life hatsue
apparently the girl has heard this before
this is why they fear death
because life here is separate from being
the girl takes a long pin
begins carefully to fasten her hair
breaking eye contact with the mirror
it is why they have no soul
is the girl even listening
the old womans voice never rises
life embraces death includes it
this truth brings tranquility
you must see yourself
as a leaf
on a great tree
no irony in the girls voice
the old woman reads the young face in the mirror
could be better placed
close on year old ishmael
eating an apple
a horrific clanging surrounds us
the clash of metal on metal
my lessons came from my father
they were different
or seemed so at the time
see arthur chambers now at the printing press an enormous lime green contraption with rollers and conveyor pulleys in a cast iron housing
the shrieking of metal and gears recalls an ancient locomotive
he operated the review alone with an integrity and passion for principle that made him a figure of respect
if slightly larger than life
arthur is a large rugged man with round gun metal rimmed spectacles and garters on his shirtsleeves
he wears the soft perpetual smile of an oxford don as he gracefully ducks in and out of the machine inspecting plates and printing cylinders
he never spoke of wanting me to succeed him
and in truth it was the last job on earth i thought id ever want
the boy rises now
sets his apple carefully aside
and under his fathers supervision takes his place operating the press
his arms inches from the fearful clatter of the rollers
when i was five he casually mentioned that if his sleeve got caught in the press hed be instantly popped open like a childs balloon and splattered across the walls
watch ishmael running the monster coolly efficiently with complete concentration
even his bones would disappear to be discovered later on the floor as strips of white confetti
arthur turns away lest his son feel a lack of confidence
picks up the boys apple
a crisp bite
which of course made me certain that life would have no meaning until i could run that teakettle
arthur and ishmael now strolling main street in the midst of what seems a festive carnival
he was for better or worse the only god in my life
i guess its our nature to resent those we know we can never measure up to
they are passing modest parade floats booths with food and games
a genial crowd of farmers fishermen families both races heedlessly mingling
arthur unselfconsciously slips his arm over the shoulder of his tall son
which keeps us from accepting the warmth
the way we should
up ahead a crowd has gathered at the steps of the courthouse
every summer after harvest the strawberry festival was dads favor ite story to cover
good news was his preference
making him an oddity among journalists
as we approach we see a ceremony begin at the top of the courthouse steps
highlight was crowning the strawberry princess
always a japanese girl sort of an unwitting virgin sacrifice to the concept of racial harmony
we are there now
arthur pulling down the same box camera ishmael would use years later
focusing up at the mayor as he places the crown on the radiant young girl
it was hatsue
and as the applause ripples through the crowd
as the strawberry princess acknowledges her subjects her eye falls on
she drops him a wink
and a special wave
she winked at me
which was unusual
two year olds alone on a beach
digging for clams in the mud
i had kissed her once when we were ten
looking at fish through a glass bottomed box
it was just an impulse and no big deal
ishmael pulls back from the deep hole to make room for hatsue to reach down
we can see her fingers explore the shell of the dug in geoduck clam
hes still got a good grip
we need to dig more
at school she kept mostly to the japanese kids and sort of ignored me
as if all of our times alone together
in the hollow cedar everywhere
were a secret
they are digging now together
i told myself that was good
that it made our friendship special
and didnt mean she was ashamed of it
slow is best
gently she begins to dislodge the clam from its lair
i thought about her
sometimes all the time
i knew i was unhappy
but i knew if i told her
she lifts it clear
and as she admires its size and roughness with her fingertips
as she washes it in the shallows
he watches her movements
it might be a mistake
i could never correct
ishmael quietly i like you
the words make her turn
not startled exactly
but neutral without affect
do you know what i mean hatsue
ive always liked you
there is no answer
he leans slightly closer and she looks down
this is the moment
afraid and driven he moves slowly to her face
and puts his mouth against hers
she lets him and encouraged he pushes harder making hatsue
lose her balance and planting a hand beneath the water to support herself eyes closed too tightly she kisses ishmael for a long moment before
leaping up snatching her clam pail and running away down the beach like a deer
he stands slowly
to watch her go
i knew in my heart that we would love each other forever
his face is slack and unsmiling but he is helpless with happiness
contemplating this truth
the way she kissed me
she knew it too
ishmael crouching at the edge of the farm in near darkness
she avoided me for a week
across the distance the screen door opens light slips across the porch
hatsue appears with a wicker basket to take the laundry from the line
so this way i could see her without
he watches rapt as she unpins and folds the clothes clenching the clothespins in her teeth
then reeling the line again elegant hand over elegant hand
i was certain everything would work out
she corrals the long sweep of her hair knotting it deftly before heading inside
children working fields in sunlight
kneeling in the rows
hatsue with a half dozen japanese girls her hair loose her face lightly sheened with sweat
she works with efficiency and grace filling her flat
three rows away
the fear not far beneath the surface of his quiet dark features
by two weeks i knew i had made the defining mistake of my life
hatsues gaze drifts slightly in this direction and ishmael looks down rapidly at his work
cheeks burning certain she is watching
which she is not
id ruined everything
end of day
the young pickers turning in their flats as a gentle rain begins
hatsue counts her money slips it into her pocket and
runs lightly off into the growing rain
stricken to his soul with longing
hatsue drenched alone with her thoughts in the protection of the hollow cedar
the rain is driving now and she glances up
at something we dont see
and watches it
you followed me huh
pull back to see him
rain pelting off his poor soaked form
she is waiting for an answer
it sort of
happened i just
i followed you
she pulls her hair behind her ears
a movement which stretches her body
im all wet
she starts refastening her hair now looking away
he comes inside crouches as respectfully far from her as he can
which is close
he watches her watches her and
im sorry i kissed you on the beach
as if she hasnt heard
now his heart is beating straight through his chest
lets just forget about it
forget it happened
she picks up her damp straw hat
and eyes down tracing a finger around its brim
dont be sorry
im not sorry about it
his heart bursts within him
and he struggles to keep it from his face
even though she isnt watching
she turns her face to him and offers a small smile
it is genuine and therefore dazzling to the boy
she lies back on the ground
her eyes so unafraid and direct
do you think this is wrong
staring at her lying there so comfortably
the best part was that there was a this
to debate the wrongness of
your friends would
your dad would kill me with a machete
were japanese not mexican ishmael
hell slice you up with a ceremonial sword
they are both grinning now
would be the problem
were only talking
her eyes flicker
the synapse that a woman can offer a man
hatsue softly sure
and touches his hand
with her fingertips
the barest whisper
i cant hear you
thus invited he leans down over hatsue
kisses her mouth with all the tenderness in him
this time her eyes close gently
and her body arches slightly into his
we kissed for half an hour that first time
and i knew there would never be another day like it
rain pounding now
a curtain of water sealing them from the world
no matter how long i lived
close on ishmael once more in the row of reporters
absently kneading the stump of his amputated arm
the way some men drum their fingers
you were acquainted with the defendant and his family
etta heine is a linebacker in a dress
stout and german and wary
she is and pulls her hem down tight below her knees
him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land
lived in a pickers cabin at first
so the defendant knew the deceased your son even then
they fished tgether
went to school
carl junior treated him like a white person
like any friend
said not with pride but regret
but the dispute began
with the father yes
etta twenty years younger watches stoically from the parlor window as her husband carl senior strools the strawberry fields with kabuos father zenhichi
carl is a huge rawboned man and puffs a pipe as zenhichi stops sweeps his arms this way and that
etta knows trouble when she sees it
etta pours her husbands coffee
it is very quiet
dont sell carl
youll regret it
only seven acres and the worst seven at that
theyre decent folks
they got five hunnerd to put down now dont go wavin new church clothes at me
were not such paupers as sell to japs are we
for what a pouch of fancy pipe tobacco
she walks about the kitchen with her arms folded
too upset to be still
they work hard live clean dont spend nothin
even kind to the indjuns
people is people comes down to it
etta turns sharply
glares at the big man
he just blinks blandly puffs his pipe
she can see this ship has sailed
you wear the pants doncha
go ahead sell our land to a jap and see what comes of it
hooks pacing slow and calm
this part needs to be clear
but back in japanese born could not own land
carl held it for em
called it a lease
they make payments every june and december
if they could never take title
their kids was born here
so when the oldest that one there was twenty
last payment gets made and he could own it
she folds her hands
looks kabuo square in the eye
but they missed their last two payments
so that was that
and zenhichi sit at the table
there is coffee
but it is untouched
etta watches by the stove
march orders came down
japs had eight days before the army was gonna cart em off
carl lights his pipe
compassion in his broad weathered face
softly eight days
it aint right
we must leave everything
if you like you can work our fields sell berries keep the money
otherwise they just rot
japs are shrewd
offer berries he cant use
soften us up about those two payments still to come
and sure enough zenhichi produces a neat stack of bills
puts them on the table
today i have toward next paym
absolutely not zenhichi
im not gonna take your savings at a time like this
the small man spreads the bills out
on the table
please you take
then i send more from where im going
if not enough you still have seven acres strawber
thought you was givin us those
didnt you come in here givin them away
now you want after our labor and fertilizer
is that what you come here hopin on
zenhichi keeps his anger within
his face is stone
i spit on him and hes pretending it didnt happen that way
how could anyone trust people like that
you want more coffee
no thank you
take money please
but carl is staring at his wife
she stares right back
carl turns slides the money toward zenhichi
ettas been rude to you and i apologize for that
you keep this money and those payments will work out fine
somewhere down the road
two figures sit at opposite ends of this darkening room each under a lamp
is reading the paper
his face is stone
etta at a small writing desk strewn with bills and ledgers
her face is angry
a screen door opens
big footfalls coming
no one looks up
look at this
he stands in the doorway
a bamboo fishing road in his giant hand
kabuo loaned it to me
til he gets back
and his parents stare back him
its great for sea run cutthroat
the ferrules are smooth silk wrapped
take that back
and do it now
the big young face is stunned hurt
i told kabuo id take ca
those japs owe us
i dont want nothin confusing that
the boy looks to his father
who says nothing
i said now boy
suppers in forty minutes
crestfallen defeated the boy backs away
hear his footfalls
the screen door slam hard
and carl sr
looks at his wife
no sound until
we aint right together
the words are flat and straight
you and me
we just aint right
hooks settles back
his butt on the edge of the prosecutors table
the soul of patience and clarity
you said neither of the last two payments were made
but your husband told defendants father that he could pay them
what down the road
and straight back
road ended october when my husband passed away
thats all there was to it
i sold all the land to our neighbor ole jurgensen
got a fair price this time
and straightens her spine
to deliver the clincher
sent all their equity back to those japs down in california
which i didnt have to do
specially since my boy was out in the pacific gettin shot at by japs at the time
as if drinking this in
now defendants father had also died by that point
where was the defendant
when you sent his family their equity
in the war
europe i believe
they could hardly send him to the pacific could they
kabuo watching the woman
eyes as hard as her own
and when he came home
did he write you about this
or phone perhaps
just showed up at my door big as life and twice as mean
wanted to talk to my son
kabuo stands at the open door
no one is inviting him inside
hes over the ocean fighting the japs
theyre just about licked
kabuo quietly just about
and there it sits
heine passed away i couldnt farm the place myself could i
youre gonna have to talk to ole abou
i just did
he didnt know we were one payment away
you didnt tell him mr
heine promised my fath
i was sposed to tell him theres some illegal contract muddling things up
you folks didnt make your pay ments
in america bank comes in and repossesses your land
i didnt do anything wrong
wrong is a different mat
get out of here
you sold our land out from under us mrs
you took advantage of the fact that we were gone
the door has closed in his face
and kabuo stands there
as if deciding
whether to break it down
hooks standing at the jury box now
looking at them as he asks
what do you mean by dirty looks
every time i see him in town or somewhere hes starin at me with these narrow eyes
givin me his mean face
when your son came back from the war what did he say about all this
that hed keep an eye on miyamoto
watch out for him
did he see some danger from defen
asking witness to speculate about deceaseds state of mind
what did your son say to that effect
she looks up
as if trying to recall
he said he wished kabuo would forget about his seven acres and stop lookin at us cross eyed
hooks stares at the jury
holds the moment
and goes slowly back to his seat
nels waits until his opponent is seated
just three questions
the miyamoto family bought your seven acres for
defaulted on their payments
what did ole jurgensen pay you per acre
so that makes what would have been into doesnt it
if you sent the equity back you had a profit of
is that your third question
you done your math right
the old man wears a thin cold smile
no further questions
hold on kabuo
as he watches etta rise heavily from the box
mist of moments before dawn
as tendrils part there is enough light to see
they are asian
they are razor keen
pull back to reveal
kabuo alone in g
gear and helmet
rifle up high sweat on his face moving soundlessly turning in a circle as he goes until
a heartbeat of silence
the blast of automatic tracer tears through trees as he whirls and returns fire in a single motion until
his heart is pounding
weapon at the ready he pushes through the dense foliage to see
the year old german soldier splayed on the forest floor his chest torn and bloodied
kabuos gaze locks with the boys
the young soldiers empty left hand reaches out in a a plea and as kabuo steps forward the boys right hand comes suddenly
into view metal glinting in motion as kabuo
blows the boy away with staccato rifle bursts that jump the already lifeless body like an electric jolt
and falling from the kids hand not a pistol but
no expression on kabuos face
none at all
he moves on
ole jurgensen wobbles slightly in the witness box hands resting on the cane planted unsteadily between his frail legs
his eyes leak water his beard is wispy and unkempt
were those his exact words
ole shaky he say mrs
heine robbed him
heine never woulda let no such ting like that hap
he was angry
he said someday he would get his land back
did he offer to buy the seven acres from you
but this is nine year ago i had my healt i wasnt wantin to sell
and then your stroke came this summer
and you put your property on the market i believe you said september
which remember is eight days before carl heine died
and who comes spetember wanting to buy
carl heine came
lets that sink in
but carl was a fisherman
and successful at it
he said he didnt want that life no more
hed been saving to buy a farm
he was sorry i got sick
but pretty excited to get back his fathers place
the old mans head bobs
liesel and me
was happy for him
as if he would be happy too
anyone would be
and later that same day
only eight days before carl heine died
did another prospective buyer appear
ole sits in a wicker chair at a wicker table
his wife liesel is setting out cold drinks
but their visitor stands rigid disbelieving
im sorry to tell you we took his earnest money he shook oles hand
come november hell sell his boat and take over the farm
kabuo is thunderstruck
but your sign
we dint have no time to take it down
he just come ten oclock
his voice is soft but his eyes are steel
its my fault
i should have come earlier
he looks so odd perhaps hes ill
liesel looks concerned
if you want tbuy them seven acres
carl heines the only fella can sell em
the witness box is empty
the snow outside the windows is falling in darkness
and judge lew fielding is leaning his frame toward the jurors
i apologize for keeping you folks from your families in a storm like this
i do hope youll be reasonably comfortable in the hotel tonight
and one more thing
he smiles softly
this court takes judicial notice of the fact that tomorrow is the th anniversary of the attack on pearl harbor
to make sure they are listening
which has no relationship to this trial
which is why i mention it
gavel cracks down
oclock tomorrow folks
hatsue walks briskly down the crowded hallway her eyes searching the benches lining the corridor ahead
her view obscured by the crowd hurrying to fight the storm
on a bench
next to him a round japanese american baby boy of months
before him squat the boys sisters eight and four
all are watching ishmael
manipulating a coin
it rolls across his knuckles and back again with amazing dexterity
then he snatches it into his palm
holds up his fist
all little eyes are glued
it is empty
there are gasps
know where it is
its in my other hand
the four year old laughs
her big sister socks her
and mom steps in
the man looks up with the sweetest smile
your mother went to the bathroom
she said i could show them a trick
hatsue is not smiling
nor is she angry
even awkward comes to her in a graceful way
she scoops up her son
thank you for your help
to the girls lets go find obaasan
and without even glancing at him she heads off at a brisk pace
the girls following
the four year old turning back to wave once
and then they are gone
kabuo stands outside the open steel door of his tiny cell as abel martinson clumsily unfastens the manacles
a cot a toilet without a seat a bare bulb hanging from a wire
no windows to the outside world
only the small barred one in the cell door
as the manacles fall away
abel removes two objects from his pocket
this is from nels i cant see the harm
dont tell art okay
hands him two candy bars
and a baby ruth
kabuo looks at them
in spite of himself
kabuo sits in jailhouse overalls on the edge of his cot
on a private journey of the mind
the door clangs open
this here is nels gudmundsson hes your attorney
kabuo looks over
that flat unsmiling gaze
the old man has a folded chessboard and a havana cigar box under his arm
their eyes lock as if the sheriff werent even here
and moran leaves closing the door with respectful quiet
nels doesnt smile doesnt speak
opens the chessboard on the cot
opens the cigar box filled with chess pieces two cigars a snickers and a baby ruth
he puts the candy bars by kabuos pillow a silent gift
begins to set up the chessboard
what makes you think i play
your daddy played
i asked down at the japanese community center
you smoke cigars
and offers one up rough and black
im not sure
i better check down at the center
kabuo smiles only with his eyes
nels nods maybe you better
lights his own cigar
puts the matches and the other cigar at kabuos side
white or black
you mean do i like to take the offensive
or hang back and wait
that seems answer enough for nels
he turns the board around to where he has white and makes the first move
when two fellas understand each other
kabuo picks up the cigar
strikes a match
kabuo moves a black bishop
nels eyes shoot around the table
he reaches and knocks over kabuos black king
kabuo blinks studies the board silently
he unwraps the snickers bar
breaks it in half
hands one piece across to his lawyer
rapid cuts different days nels in different suits chess pieces in different positions each time nels reaching to topple kabuos king
the last time
kabuo has to study the board for a beat
shakes his head
you must think i like losing
i think you like learning
and leans his old bones back against the hard wall
thats why i come
pulls out two cigars
kabuo looks at them
bet theres a few things you could teach me
kendo for one
i could take a fishing gaff and split your head open
right above your left ear
you wouldnt even see it move
how come i never ask
if you did it
hands one cigar
across the chessboard
now youve told me you killed four men
so i know you are the kind of man who can kill
when theres a reason
kabuo very quiet guess i am
takes the cigar
rolls it between his thumb and forefinger
you feel guilty
that you took their lives
thats in your eyes
strikes a match
nels softly jury sees what i see
more often than not
kabuo bends toward him
accepts the flame
takes a puff
what was your reason
to kill carl heine
kabuo says not a word
well there is the land itself
raise your children where you were raised
sleep with your wife at night stead of bein alone on the sea
brings the match to his own cigar
theres fairness and honor
you were cheated by that old bitch
boy she is something
kabuo simply shes not alone
worlds within those words
nels a murmur none of us are
and in those
and prejudice like you say
your people locked in a concentration camp
you go off to fight for our countrys freedom
come back to this
shakes his head
hooks has missed the one reason
you coulda done it
behind the defendants eyes
i read you etta heines deposition
so i could watch your mind
like i do when you move your rook or when i move mine
a smile now
and you werent thinking about her
or about land
or about you
no you werent
and in the gentlest voice
no someone cheats you you can rise above that
youre a family man
you put them ahead of you hmmn
wasnt you she dishonored
and the old watering eyes are rock steady now
your father was a strong and tireless man
honest to a fault
kind and humble as well
there is a silence
kabuo real quiet nice
when two fellas
understand each other
they let that sit
now this jury is gonna be lookin at the evidence with one eye
and at you with the oth
gudmundsson we know what that jury is looking at
he wont let hs eyes lie to this man
your father needs you
to return to your family
so every time you think about showing that jury strength
or honor or composure
i should show them an american
nels sees the rage
it breaks his heart
it makes him feel old and helpless
show them an innocent man
what he stares at now
is a neutral mask
as powerful and opaque as the voice is quiet
shame you couldnt play chess with my dad sir
hed kick your ass
through glass snow is tumbling in endless cascades the world dwarfed by a descending heaven
a sound a strange soft click
the small well kept bachelor apartment
neat stacks of books on the floor catching the overflow of shelves crammed full
someone likes to read
another soft click
the kitchen now along the floor
an awkward high top shoe its buckled straps above elastic laces that fasten across the instep
the shoe steps on a crude wooden pedal
and we hear another click
pan up along a vertical strip of mesh wire to
a plywood contraption held by a partially closed drawer
a piece of spring steel holding a set of nail clippers
ishmael inserts his pinkie carefully
finishes clipping the fingernails of his only hand
and looks out
at the magic of white
safe within their haven the year olds kiss and hold each other urgently
their tongues exploring each others mouth her legs open beneath her skirt pressing her body up against him
i gave her all of my soul to love
i knew someday we would live in france
far from the things that upset her
later they lie so quietly
her head nestled in the crook of his arm he gently plays with her hair
her face so still so thoughtful and grave
ishmael a murmur you dont have to be so tragic you know
her dark eyes flicker
hatsue dry kind of magical the way you know how to comfort a girl
she cuts the irony by sending her fingertips to stroke his
i can just feel my spirits soar
well i dont do it for just anybody
and kisses her head
but her eyes still stare off into the tangle of her worries
he draws a breath
there cant be any wrong in this ha
i lie to my parents every day
and every night
his light tone against the fear
since i never told your folks i guess im lying to em too
but you dont hear me complaining about it
she winds her fingers with his
loyalty against her doubt
very soft with
im in awe
of your strength
hatsue sits with the japanese kids
ishmael with his friends
the bus filled with stone faced teenagers listening to the driver who brandishes his newspaper at the japanese side of the bus
not just pearl theyre attackin all over the pacific the whole fleet s destroyed
the fbis in seattle right now
his eyes moving from one japanese face to the next
are you listening
arresting jap traitors the spies and everything
therell be a blackout tonight so keep your radios off
so the japs dont pick up no signals
you get the message
stares them down
until from across the bus
lamberson over here
the drivers eyes snap around
the tall boy is waiting
i have a radio too
dont you want to be sure got the message
ishmael sees the anger
hes not afraid of it
the horrid clanging of the great rattletrap press arthur chambers ducking nimbly among the rollers
it was a special edition an extra
my father wrote these people are our neighbors they have sent their sons to the united states army
print flying onto paper as it rolls through the green metal gauntlet
they are no more an enemy than our fellow islanders of german or italian descent
belary eyed ishmael pulling finished copies from the bin
as he stacks them for delivery he reads aloud above the clash of metal
ishmael sleepy and loud big yawn
its really late
he turns and sees
staring at him
i guess courage never inspires the young
until the danger of it bites their butt
they walk slowly up the path
an arm around each others waist their bodies brushing as they go
my father cant get our money from the bank
we have a few dol
itll be over soon
i can get you money
by a weathered fence covered in vines
its growing dark
its not going to get better okay
he moves close looks so grave
they arrested mr
shirazaki because his farm is near a navy transmitter
and his family cant leave their house
what can he say
its just pearl harbor
people are a little crazy right n
look at my face
its the face of the people who did that
my father hardly speaks english
were in bad trouble you have to see that
touches this face that he loves with all his heart
forces up a smile
maybe we can fix your eyes
she leans up
crosses her eyes in a goofy expression
then kisses his mouth
when she pulls back
dont let this hurt us okay
and she studies this boy
knowing more than he can ever understand
and chooses to whisper
hatsue and her older daughter are setting the farmhouse table as snow drifts down beyond the window
plates and flatware
glasses and napkins
slowly in silence as if a ritual bonding mother and daughter
she glances to the next room
her mother fujiko plays with the babies
her father hisao reads the paper
smoking his pipe
and hatsue is motionless for a moment
close on hatsue at staring with silent anger greater than her fear
shaky we are loyal
pull back to see the room
hatsue and her sisters side by side staring at the table
on it rests a shotgun four boxes of shells a ceremonial sword
an fbi agent a small man in a dark suit is tagging each item
he wears a light perpetual insincere smile
everyone on the island has these things
fujiko at her husbands side
she is quietly indignant
he is frightened
agent overly casual well theyll hold this stuff for a little bit then ship it back to you
its nothing to worry about
and walks over to the tansu a chest of drawers and begins to remove items
you folks have been real polite and well be outta your hair in just a second
a silk kimono with gold brocaded sash
thats very nice
from the old country it appears
very high class
and lays it on another table
next to a bamboo flute a stack of shakuhachi sheet music
these are real nice things
theyll take special care of em
hisao sees his wifes sudden alarm
and as respectfully as he can manage
the flute is precious
the kimono the music
must you take th
oh yeh any old country stuff we have to take
and sees on the sofa an open album
this is only my daughters scrapbook
for her memories
so he picks it up
doesnt see hatsue stiffen with repulsion as he wanders thumbing through it toward the hallway
agent calling out wilson
dont go pawing through the underwear
he knows they appreciate a joke
it means theres nothing to be afraid of
stops turning pages now
looks up his eyes moving until they find hatsue
strawberry princess huh
you musta been flattered by that
looks just like y
the soft slamming of a screen door
another agent large and shambling in his too small suit is carrying a crate
and a telling look
agent quiet triumph dynamite
twenty four sticks
and the crate bangs onto the table
just beside the kimono
lifts out two sticks and holds them high
you must believe
this for tree stumps
for clearing land
the small mans smile fades now
and his eyes fix hisao before he speaks
as if reading his mind
but this is still bad ysee
fujiko slips her hand into her husbands
to give him strength
its illegal contraband you were sposed to turn this stuff in
we gotta arrest you
have to take you to seattle
fujikos breath catches
one of the daughters whimpers
the silence hangs thick and frightening
the bigger agent unhooks a pair of handcuffs from his belt but
naw you dont need those
mister eee ma da san here is a class act a real gentleman
the younger girls are crying now clinging to their sisters
the agent regrets this
he has done no bad th
well nobody knows that yet do they
so best for an honest man to clear his name for godd and all
aint that right
only a few questions in seattle okay
few questions few answers the whole thing is over
he puts his hand on hisaos arm
not roughly but much firmer than the ease of his voice
simple as that
eight pages of a letter carefully written in kanji characters folded neatly on a table
why do i read you this distres sing letter
from your father
from this hakujin
work camp it is called
pull back to see mother and five daughters around the table
even the youngest girls somber attentive
as if they have aged these past few weeks
because you need to know the darkness
in the hearts of the hakuj
hatsue blurts not all of them
the silent wake of her outburst her interruption lingers
her mother studies her
the whites are enslaved by their egos hatsue
each believes his aloneness is everything
we seek union wi
the ones seeking union with the greater life bombed pearl harbor
they are not humble
i am not part of them im part of here her voice so loud so insistent
her sisters are afraid for her
to have shown such disrespect
they look down at their hands
or away as if not hearing
fujiko quietly slowly i see this
this lack of purity is a mist around your soul
i see it every day it haunts your face in unguarded moments
the room is still as the grave
the mothers eyes burn silently
i see it in your eagerness to leave here
and walk the woods
in the afternoon
what does she know
hatsues heart pounding
and to her surprise her mothers voice softens
if you lose your true self hatsue
the stern warning the unrelenting judgement has become a plea
there is no way back
ishmael washing his supper plate
his fork and knife
his coffee mug
hard labor with one hand
and as he works he looks at
the window above his sink
darkness and moonlit snow
and his own reflection
close on his face in the glass and match dissolve to
worn behind the smile of knowing ease as he sips coffee from a mug of his own
his boy sits across from him in the silent press room
feet up reading their paper
its headline island japanese accept army see you bring it on yourself
ladies honored by the pta you single out three names
and theyre all japanese
that isnt journalism
arthur quietly because
ishmael has heard this gently prodding word all his life
is just the facts
you cant print them all
journalism is balance
finding the facts folks need to know
the boy looks dryly at his father
slaps the page with the back of his hand
arthur closes his eyes
recites from memory
seems like youre favoring the japs art
writin all about their patriotism and loyalty with nothin bout the treachery
a smile in the voice
a sad one
your newspaper is an insult to all white americans
please cancel my subscription and send refund
now the smile is on his face
the calls are better
jap lovers get their balls cut off and stuffed down their
shrugs missed the rest
hanging up will do that
watching each other
we lost the price rite ads
and lottie opsvigs shop and larsens lumberyard and the anacortes cafe
and percent of our subscribers
a deeper silence
integrity is expensive stuff huh
toasts his son
ive got the answer
a swallow of joe
print four pages
instead of eight
they lie so close
their bodies touching not moving
their faces inches apart so that every word is a murmur
youre like me
youve learned to be devious
hes never seen her this fragile this scared
he knows he has to be strong for her
its not devious its what we have to do
youre leaving tomorrow
he unties her hair
tries to keep his smile calm steady
you write to my house and put kenny yamashitas name on the return address
its no big deal
he brings his face to her hair
you smell like cedar
her eyes are wide
they move over his face
so do you
its your smell ill miss as much as anything
he looks in her eyes
and words come from his heart before he can stop them
lets get married okay
her eyes fill with tears
are they from happiness
i want to marry you
is that okay
her face so still
one tear falls and he kisses it
ishmael a whisper just say yes
not knowing what to say she winds an arm behind his head and brings him nearer
his mouth opens into hers with more force more of his heart than he has ever given
deep and tender
his hands reach beneath her dress
peel her panties down her thighs
when something that means your whole life
is the last time ever
and suddenly he is over her drawing her legs up around him
god should tell you
or its not fair
her head tilts back her eyes squeeze closed
and as he enters her
ishmael whispers please say yes
her hands grasp his upper arms
and push away
hatsue softly no
and he blinks
as if waking from a dream
everything has stopped
her face is strong and yet overflowing with regret
it isnt right
so he draws away
watching with blank eyes as she stares up at him
then with dignity and tenderness he helps her dress his eyes awkwardly away from hers
it felt right to me
it felt like getting married
she draws her legs up
kneeling now putting her hands on his face
but no words come
ill write you
and kisses him fiercely and bolts up before he can grab her running off like a deer while he
his mouth open
like a silent scream
an army truck pulls up behind several others in cold morning air
hesitantly looking in all directions fujiko hatsue and her four sisters climb from the truck to see
on monday march the united states army graciously transported the imada women to the docks
a ferry the kehloken stands waiting
soldiers are dis tributing tags for luggage and coats
the evacuees mostly women stand in the cold trying to smile bravely for each other
and lined against the railing
lifelong neighbors came to watch
curiosity masked as kindness
a cluster of white islanders gawking as their japanese neighbors file toward the ferry
a middle aged woman waves to fujiko who casts her eyes down refusing to acknowledge the greeting
and just as they reach the gangway
hatsue sees ishmael who stands at an unobtrusive distance among a group of students
her eyes hold his for a heartbeat
with some exceptions
the wisp of a smile
and she is gone
hatsue comes alone onto the white blanketed porch
snow is no longer falling
she takes out a cigarette lights it impassively
the mannerisms make her seem fully american despite the porcelain impenetrability of her asian exterior
she closes her eyes and
draws deep on the smoke
the act seems to cause her pain
when the eyes open they are frightened unguarded
nowhere to turn
the next puff looks desperate and she flips the cigarette out onto the snow
jams her hands in the pockets of her parka stamps her feet against the cold the helplessness
and looks out
strawberry fields endless and white shimmering in filtered moonlight become
a moonlit desert
pan the barbed wire the distant barracks the desolation
two women walking alone
the younger one glancing at her mother as they go
fujikos eyes unreadable stare implacably ahead
the barracks everything in distance behind them
you think were far enough away now
no sarcasm in the voice
she lets the words carry her irony
her mother stops
looks at her so directly so strong
even her tough minded daughter flinches slightly
mom whatever this is they dont keep war secrets this carefully
fujiko thinks that over
secrets are hard to keep
she goes over to a large flat rock
pulls two sheets of paper from her coat
as her daughter comes and crouches at her feet
fujiko clears her throat
as the shard of fear penetrates her daughters mask
fujiko reads my love
i still go to our cedar tree in the afternoons every day
i shut my eyes waiting
hatsue has turned to stone
fujiko reads i smell your smell
and i dream of you
and i ache for you to come home
so i can hold you and feel you near
fujiko scans the page silently
turns to the second
fujiko reads after all these years that weve been together i find youre a part of me
without you i have nothing
all my love forever
and looks up
her eyes calm quiet
the neighborhood boy
who taught you to swim
the look holds
you shouldnt have opened that
it was mi
fujiko so quiet how deceitful of me
anger only at the edges
like finely honed steel
how can i ever hope
for your forgiveness
the wind swirls a cloud of dust between them
they seem not to notice
i have written this letter to the boys parents
she pulls out a single page
hands it down to her daughter
hatsues eyes move quickly over the words
attraction is no crime certainly among children
the dishonor lies in the concealment
from your families
watches her daughter reading
i know that you know this
i know you have suffered
even if the hakujin could not
hatsues eyes cast down
she folds the page
there will be no further letters
no contact of any k
because hatsue is tearing the page in two
she looks up
into her mothers shock
one more letter
i will write it
you may read it and send it for me
her mothers anger fades
i deceived more than you
i deceived this sweet boy
it was never love
the mothers face changes
there is understanding acceptance
i will work hard
to earn your forgiveness
a sadness deep beyond her years
i can never hope for his
mother and daughter enter their crude quarters
they find hatsues sisters sitting on the wooden floor watching
a team of young men working with tools and pieces of lumber
one is building shelves two others a chest of drawers
their leader kneels tacking scraps of tin over the knotholes on the floor
one girl beams at her mother
these boys are buildings us a mansion
the leader grins and rises
bows slightly to fujiko
he is of course
im kabuo miyamoto mrs
the woman smiles
bows slightly in return
we are in your debt miyamoto san
how are your parents your family
my father is sick with the camp food
the rest of us are fine
dont speak of dept please we just want to help
to the eldest daughter
in the doorway
hi hatsue remember me
she looks back without expression
there is much on her mind
his smile is handsome easy
i was a senior when you were a junior
but ive seen you around
she tosses her hair free of the parka
gathers it in her hands
cant win a smile but he doesnt seem to mind
nice to see you
ishmael steps from the building onto the rear porch
he draws from his coat a black cigar
box of matches
the cigar goes into his mouth
with amazing dexterity
he slips a single match from the box turns his face to the wall and still palming the box strikes a match on the buckle of his belt bringing it
smoothly to the cigar for a few critical puffs before the match dies
he turns toward
stretching treeless endless seemingly to the horizon
bathed in filtered moonlight they become
the shimmering pacific
we are with ishmael in an lcvp landing craft as his platoon enters tarawa lagoon
bobbing past two destroyers firing in waves at the beach
ishmael and his platoon mates watch with adrenaline fueled fear as amphibious tractors draw fire on the sand one exploding in flame
her letter reached me on the north island of new zealand
so i had a month to think it over
men around him are shouting cursing jostling against each other frightened out of their minds as shells pound the ocean horrify ingly huge and near
i wrote her four times
i hate you with all my heart
i hate you hatsue ill hate you always
suddenly their craft runs aground on the hidden reef
they are still yards from shore
i never sent the letters
i wanted to kill as many japs as possible
the squad leader goes over the side ishmael and others follow struggling with pound packs
as ishmael hits the water the squad leader is shot in the face a man five yards from ishmael has the top of his head blown away men are dropping
in numbers under the withering bursts of fire the deafening ordnance sweeping over the shrieks of terror and agony and ishmael
submerges behind his pack splashing hard keeping its bulk ahead of him as a shield until he can wade and swim and plunge toward shore as hellfire crashes everywhere dead
bodies floating machine gun blasts whipping the waters surface ishmael at
the shallows now men rising to make a run at the seawall being cut down ishmael crouching in the water watching other men draw fire and in a moments lull
four of them and ishmael
go for it lungs bursting pounding madly up the sand one shot dead another screams as his knee is blown away and goes down writhing as three men
make it to the wall
gasping puking shivering with cold and fright
they have no gear no weapons
one of them is ishmael
he looks back to
eric bledsoe was bleeding to death
thirty yards away
bullets flying everywhere chewing up the sand
the young man twitching pleading
bledsoe crying oh shit please please help me you guys come on help me fucking help me please
and flat against the seawall three men watch
not daring to look at each other
i knew nothing could save him
hell i didnt have so much as a band aid
i also knew i was a coward
for not giving up my life to try
ishmael and his companions have been joined by others
sixty or so men mill in the shadow of the seawall
the beach is littered with dead marines and wounded calling for help
as ishmael glances up a sergeant leaps onto the seawall cigarette dangling from his mouth
you pussies are the kinda chickenshits deserve to have your balls chewed off real slow when this is over
stands with his hands on his hips
the men below him properly mesmerized
any man who wont follow me over this wall is a cornhole fucker with a half inch hard on wh
the words cut off by the shell that rips through his spine opening his shirt front as he pitches forward flat upon the sand
no one looks
no one speaks
it never happened
i wanted to live
and i didnt know why
ishmael has a carbine now and a field machete
pull back to reveal marines all down the wall a striking force assembled from the survivors of multiple landings
some colonel came down the beach
any man who didnt go over the wall at would be court martialed disgraced and imprisoned
every man lining up now rifles at the ready
the captain who followed said shot on sight
they seem more resigned or is it stunned numb than terrified
there is no interaction
each man dealing with his own insides
squad leaders go over the wall the firing erupts and three hundred marines scramble into the teeth of it mortar and machine gun barrage lighting the sky from the row
of battered palm trees ishmael sprinting the man next to him goes down ishmael turns instinctively and a shot
rips into his left bicep spinning him off his feet in slo mo falling to dirt as all goes
ishmael feverish writhing unconscious against the straps that hold him to a table
all around him a hell of men and blood and doctors and limbs and shouted curses they never showed us on m
my arm was dealt with by a pharmacists mate whose surgical career was four hours old
ishmael lurches his eyes pop open wild and bleary
he used a handsaw
seeing there in a corner on a pile of blood soaked dressings
his left arm
i dream of it now and then
the way my fingers curled
against the wall
he blinks at it
realizing at last that the arm is his
fucking goddam jap bitch an orderly turns at the words
as if he knows
it was all i could think of to say
his eyes squeeze shut
there was nothing more to say
for a long while
close on a dark blue suit
hanging on a hook against the green wall
pan across the bars in the cell doors tiny window
all is dark out there and silent
the bare bulb glows
its light throws shadows of castles and horses across the chessboard
kabuo cross legged on the floor alone
his back erect
his eyes calm
stare at the pieces
kabuo at sits on the earth
by a shovel
by a lantern
this place is shielded by trees
pan across the ground to
slowly reverently placing objects into burlap sacks beside a shallow hole in the earth
wooden swords hakama pants a bokken scrolls written with care
dialogue plays in subtitled japanese
your great grandfather was a samurai a magnificent soldier
the father never looks at the son
only at his work
he killed himself
on the battlefield
the boy knows this
yet his entire being is focused on every word
he went to battle with a sword
against rifles mind you
knowing what honor required
an elegant sword
its curved blade gleaming in the lantern light
he was angry
to the point of being crazy yes
but he knew what honor
a separate sack just for this
folded with respect
honor can require loyalty
it goes into the ground
with the others
he seems nearly overcome now
by some emotion that sweeps through him
prompting the boy to murmur
these are safe father
the hakujin will never f
zenhichi quietly it is the only scale
meaning be still
so the boy is still
in which our worth
the man gazes into the hole
at his treasures
every life ends
and if it ends dishonored
it is as if
and turns to his son
to complete the words
kabuo in english we have never lived
there is love
there is strength
there is no more to say
sheriff moran sits in the witness box blade thin and fidgeting ever so slightly
uncomfortable in the limelight
in his hands are four pieces of rope
well this one here comes off miyamotos boat
matches all his others worn equal and so on
but this one here
holds it up for hooks
so the jury can see
comes off third cleat from the stern port side
and its brand new
unlike the rest
and the next one
from carl heines boat
all his were like this one three strand manila new condition braided in loops
not bowlined like miyamotos
and the last
found on carls boat too
starboard side second cleat from the stern
but it doesnt match carls lines
it matches miyamotos
so if defendant had tied up to deceaseds boat
with that last one
would those cleats have lined up
and if miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off he coulda left this line behind on carls boat
and replaced it later with the new one
thats your inference
pretty darn clear
hooks begins to pace
toward the jury
and when you visited defendant on his boat
the evening after carl heines death
did it seem pretty darn clear to him
kabuo kneeling at the battery well of his boat
he is sliding a new battery into place
beside its older companion
he bolts it down
starts his engine
he is visibly tense
as he steps onto the deck he sees
two figures at the pilings
sheriff moran makes a cutting motion across his throat as abel moves to grasp the mooring line
cut your engine were coming aboard
kabuo doesnt move
the tension has fled beneath the surface
his face now a mask
what for sheriff
we have a warrant
to search your boat
he holds it up
abel looks uneasy as if expecting anything
well what are you looking f
moran calmly a murder weapon
we think you might be responsible for the death of carl heine
as if hearing a foreign language
words that do not compute
sheriff if somebody killed carl it sure as hell wasnt me
moran steps from the dock onto the boat abel awkwardly following
then lets get this over with so you can get to fishin
now cut yor engine
and walks ahead into the cabin shining his flashlight across everything
kabuo follows killing the engine
and in the sudden silence morans beam finds
the still open battery well
you always run with the well open
i was checking the cables
morans light moves over the batteries
d s huh
and says no more
runs his beam once more around the cabin
well come back lets take a look at the stern
off he goes
kabuos glance goes to the open well
then follows noticing abel martinson prowling around the bow
but in the stern moran is shining his light
see you replaced a mooring line lately
this ones new
naw i had that around for a while
sure you did
help me with this hold cover willya
so kabuo slides the cover away
they peer in
theres nothin to see
i need to get out there fi
he has the fishing gaff
three and a half feet long
steel hook at one end
hands it to moran
theres blood on it
fish blood i gaff fish with that
moran carefully examines the object
you gaff with the hook end
bloods on the butt
where your hand goes
blood gets all over your hand sheriff ask any fisherman
moran takes out a handkerchief
holds the gaff with it
gonna have this tested
now you go home okay
wait til you hear from me
kabuos heart is racing
sheriff i cant afford not to fish toni
look no way im lettin you out there
in a half hour you could be in canada
kabuos face has gone dead
which makes it seem somehow fierce almost threatening
and the sheriff is watching that
im sorry son
but youre under arrest
moran still on the stand
the ropes are gone now
his hands interlock across his narrow thighs
now your testimony was interrupted yesterday when that power line set fire to your mother in laws farmhouse
art looks really irritated
how is your mother in law
shes alright nels thanks for asking
and her farmhouse
the damage was considerable
but shes insured
see nels now
avuncular as hell
bemused by morans annoyance
well just to put it back in our minds could you repeat what you told us
about the type of batteries you found
one carls boat
tries to be patient
one d and one d in the well
and a dead d on the deck
which you inferred was replaced by the d which must have been a spare
what else could it be
even though a d is too big and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in
beat which makes it a peculiar choice
for a spare
you said that
that was your testimony
nels chuckling i guess im a pretty smart feller after all
and what were the type batteries you found on defendants boat
moran bland d s
like i sa
no further questions
sterling whitman sits in his expensive suit a giant of a man whose towering frame ill fits the witness box
his eyes are small and blue and carry the weight of superiority with practiced ease
so the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all
it was human yes
type b positive
carl heines type
seemingly unconcerned by this fact
but you cant say with any certainty that the blood was his
no but as i say the type is rare
ten percent of caucasian males
and the blood could not have belonged to defendant
seeing that his type is o negative
you scraped the dried blood from the butt of the gaff
where a fellas hand goes
and what did you see under your microscope besides the b positive blood and the wood scrapings
and the witness stops
a curious question
but nels is waiting
with an expectant smile
bits of blood and wood
what else would there be
no bits of bone no particles of scalp no strands of hair
well if the blood got onto the gaff by crushing a mans skull
im a hemotologist sir i was asked only t
nels gently persistent would that seem logical i dont know
nels lifts the gaff off the table
looks at it
the coroner testified that carl heine had a cut
a fresh cut
probably one or two hours old
and grasps the butt end
of the gaff
on the palm
of his right hand
walks dragging one leg just slightly toward the box
and holding the butt of the gaff toward him
with no bone or scalp or hair present
would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a mans skull
im a hemotologist not a detective
or from the cut on his hand
which is more probable
whitman wont be badgered
his smile carries only a trace of coldness
it is not my function
to weigh those probabilities
nels looks him over
and turns his back
thats the jurys job
hooks in pin stripe serge today
pommaded hair glossy wing tips
he is crisp
now this regiment you were training the nd this was all nisei boys
first sergeant victor maples wears his green dress uniform splashed with decorations
thick and powerful no neck razor cut
the eyes are alive
they were japanese american boys yes sir
and you were generally experienced in training men for hand to hand combat
it was my specialty sir i trained several thousand over the years
wide cross section of men to evaluate
and the day that the defendant volunteered for this
did you find him eager
more than eager
he was out to make a point
hooks finds that interesting
begins to pace
and what point
the squad of nisei recruits one hundred young asian faces surround sgt
he paces before them holding up a wooden staff looking in their eyes
and kabup steps forward
you dont salute me you dont call me sir soldier im an enlisted man
kabuo stares back
and nobody bows in this mans army youre in america son
im sorry sir force of habit
no more sir
thats the last of that
tosses kabuo a wooden staff and a helmet
a little hard
as kabuo slips the helmet on
the exercise is avoiding thrusts
now first y
kabuo quietly ready sergeant
cut off in mid word maples glares back
thrusts sharply but kabuo moves just enough to slip the blow by no more than an inch
their eyes lock
suddenly maples unleashes
a savage series of thrusts at blinding speed and kabuo
slips them all effortlessly scarcely seeming to move
as a man might toy with a child
maples studies the face for any trace of mockery
and sees nothing at all
stabs out only to have kabuo
slash maples staff from his grasp with a move so quick as to be nearly invisible
maples clearly stunned by the display
kabuo quietly excuse me
he bends picks up maples staff hands it to him
the sergeant is hot
he looks into the faces of this nisei regiment searching for a single smirk
there is none
are you ready for some simulated combat soldier
and maples lunges with surprising speed to be swept off his feet in a blur lying flat on the earth his head pinned to the ground by the tip of
kabuo withdraws his staff
kabuo just above a whisper your weapon sergeant
maples smiling easily
like a guy telling the story in a bar
well what then sergeant
i had the boy teach me kendo
the importance of the bow
maples the loudest
hooks smiles like a regular joe
and your evaluation of the defendant
could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff
so quickly there would be no sign of struggle
oh in a heartbeat
and the smiles are gone
able and willing
like few men ive ever seen
hooks sits against the prosecution table
his demeanor gentle respectful
his voice soft
so the plan was for your husband to fish through the prime season
then in november sell the boat
and you would move onto the farm
in the box the widow sits in lovely dignity
blonde and alabaster and modest in her black dress of mourning
that was his plan yes
in the press row the boys are attentive
an angle they know they can sell
ishmael among them watching with neutral eyes
whatever she said she was hooks star witness
the jury especially the men would not betray this fine lady with a not guilty verdict
how could they face her
hooks walks slowly toward her
as if she were a precious object deserving of reverence
can you think back for me to the morning of september
the day after your husband purchased the farm
one week before his death
can you recall that morning
a bright bathroom filled with steam filtering the sunlight
push toward the opaque shower door toward the sound of rushing water
and of breathing
through it to
susan marie and her husband
her arms are wound about his neck
her legs wrapped around his body feet locked behind the small of his back
carl holds her high with his strong hands so he can lick her breasts to the rhythm of the slow slow thrusts
her wet blonde hair is pasted across her face and her eyes are closed
the intensity holds us
close on a paint brush
it rests across the lid of a can of wood stain
susan marie kneeling by the table she is refinishing
but her hands her body are motionless
her eyes stare out the window
across the yard
her towering husband walks beside a smaller man
carl is doing the talking
kabuos face is stone
susan marie sits quietly in a rocker nursing her baby
her hands tenderly stroke the feeding infant
but her eyes are attentive
what could i tell him
theres my mother to think about
you know what shed say
susan marie knows
what etta would say
i said id think it over talk with you
did he go away angry
see carl now pacing his own parlor like a caged bear
agitated in a way we could not have expected
he kept talkin about those seven acres belonged to his father and how honorable and decent his father was
his meaning was pretty clear
and i didnt much like it
you had a scrap
nursing her baby
talk to him
look kabuos a jap
and i dont hate japs but i dont like em neither
its hard to explain if you werent in the war you know
hes not a jap
you dont mean that
you and he were friends
and carl turns
looks at her
a full beat
we were kids
he looks helpless
he doesnt want his anger to spill onto her
he leaves the room
without a word
hold on her
susan maries cornflower eyes are set
so your husband said hes think it over
miyamoto to believe he might sell to h
i wouldnt say encouraged
well he didnt say no did he
didnt say no hope existed
not in those words
so the defendant was encouraged to hope
or could have been
she thinks about this
i guess so
nels is nodding
i guess youd have to guess
not having been there with them
having to guess whether your husbands report was word for word accurate
carl never lied
of course not
but it was emotional
a friends plea set against his mothers attitude
as if it had just occurred to him
those dirty looks
defendant ever aim one of those at you
he had no reason to
carl ever say he got one
i cant speak for him
you can speak for what he said just like you did for mr
objection badgering the wi
all the lights in the courtroom go out
a loud murmur
a flicker of light
then they go out again
the crowd buzzes laughs the gavel raps
the lights come on
a collective sound of relief
the gavel again
sorry about that mrs
shall i repeat the ques
carl said he didnt like kabuo much anymore
a deep one
the question is more about the defendants attitu
thats all he said
she arches her throat
and we cant ask him anymore
ishmael driving an aged desoto through the blanketed strawberry fields of center valley
my father had bought the desoto fifteen years before
driving it reminded me of him
which i considered a neutral fact
he turns the wheel using a cherry wood knob specially mounted for his convenience
actually it was pleasant
following the curve fields are pure white to the horizon
snow made all the fields into one
the notion that one man might kill another for a small patch made no sense
up ahead a willys station wagon has run into a ditch
a middle aged japanese man is working at a rear wheel with a shovel
but i knew such things occurred
having been to war and all
the man is hisao imada and we can now see his eldest daughter working with a shovel behind the car
ishmael pulls up behind them
and gets out
he crunches over to where hisao works
may i give you folks a lift
hatsue has come around the car now pulling her snowflaked hair from her eyes
i didnt look at her
i thought that would be best
her eyes on ishmaels profile hatsue goes to her fathers side
murmurs to him in japanese
when he answers she turns to face ishmael
my father is grateful for your kindness
but he will free his car shortly
ishmael smiles softly
this car isnt going anywhere
he goes to hatsue reaching gently for her shovel
okay ill help
ishmael drives with hisao beside him
i know its caused you trouble
but dont you think the snow is beautiful coming down
his eyes flick to hatsue in the rearview mirror
she stares out the side window concentrating on the world
two strands of wet hair pasted against her cheek
yes very beautiful
suddenly her eyes snap to meet ishmaels in the mirror
his dart away
this trial is unfair
you should write about that in your newspaper
he keeps driving
and he keeps his eyes on the road
ishmael calmly what should i say
this trial is wrong they are calling a good man a killer
it is only about prejudice and that is unfair
as he drives
hisao imada silent beside him
we all expect the world to be fair
as if we have some right t
i dont mean everyone
just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them
or run a newspaper
and his eyes come up
meet hers in the mirror
maybe i should write a column
what do you think
she studies his face
what do you think
on either side
i think people
should be fair
his eyes on the road now
the farmhouse seen through the drifting screen of white
will you write that
her voice is soft
the difference is palpable
i might just
his voice is kindness and friendship
i was part of her life again
i was a person
a tower of reinforced concrete rising a hundred feet above the sea
ishmaels hand in his pocket
trudging toward it
ishmael being led into a cramped room stacked floor to ceiling with wooden crates file cabinets duffel bags
our host is levant a young coast guard radioman nearly six foot six with a huge adams apple and kinky black hair
he gestures around the room at all the records
you have the night watch
on the radio
last guys got transferred
ishmael looks around
there is a lot of stuff
and you keep the records or contribute to em
shorthard the radio transmis sions write em up file em in a cabinet
nobody ever looks
just take up space
all kinds of radio transmissions
fisherman in trouble and such
make yourself at home
ishmael looks at the task before him
then out the window
his reflection stares back
as troubled as he is
ishmael at carrying milk and crackers down the aisle of a grocery store the empty sleeve of his mackinaw pinned up at the elbow
he turns the corner to see
three people in line at the register
the second is hatsue
an infant carried at her shoulder
id been back two months
it was the first time id seen her
he joins the line
the checker glances his way then looks awkwardly down
this makes the others turn
and hatsues eyes
the voice the face are cool and formal
there is no anger no unkindness
only the absence of warmth
his face hard stricken
his heart pounds in his throat
i couldnt say anything
i just stood there hating her
im sorry about your arm
kabuo and i
are very sor
the japs did it
no one knows where to look
down away anything
but hatsue never blinks
they shot it off
she holds her ground her eyes soften somehow
somewhere between compassion and pity
her slender fingers stroke the baby at her shoulder
im sorry im sorry i said that
all the feeling comes to his eyes
everything he will never tell her
im sorry about everything
all of it
he drops his milk and crackers on the counter
and walks away
ishmael sits alone
beyond the glass a searchlight sweeps the sea the snow covered shore
but ishmael stares at a folder
open in his lap
the dead of night
west corona a greek owned freighter was lost
in heavy fog
traces a line of the report
they radioed to the lighthouse
they would have to dogleg bisecting ship channel bank
and seaman philip milholland wrote that down
in his report
ishmael closes his eyes
carl heine drowned
in ship channel bank
and his watch stopped
he looks out through the glass
as if he could watch it happen
a huge freighter plowing through
throwing a wake big enough to fling any man overboard
and ishmael removes the page from the file
slowly he folds it into quarters
slides it into his coat pocket
ishmael calls out seaman
and closes the file
slips it back into the cabinet
levant appears vaguely irritated by the summons
so ishmael smiles
sorry nothing important
how long you have this detail
me and smoltz came on dogwatch september
just to clarify
you mean early morning the th
no night of the th morning the th
we replaced two guys named miller and milholland
they got transferred that day
out to cape flattery
some seamans loast report
stuffed in a cabinet good as lost forever
no one knows
ishmael rises stiffly
starts to pull on his coat
you get what you come for
and ishmael looks at the youngster
a little oddly
guess im not completely sure
what that was
ishmael at crouched among trees
above a sunlit stretch of beach
i left the grocery and wrote a letter
i apologizes from my heart
i should never have said that word to her
i never would again
close on his face
eyes gazing down
it sat in my desk for two weeks
before i threw it away
i knew her car
and sometimes when id see it id
drive that way
at a distance
see hatsue down on the beach
alone raking for steamer clams
her baby beside her on a blanket beneath an umbrella
ishmael walks down to the sand
crosses to where she works
and squats down
at a respectful distance
can i talk to you
she must have seen who was coming
because the words do not startle her
or slow her work
im married ishmael
it isnt right for us to be alone
people will t
theres no one here and ive got to talk to you
her back is to him
she is motionless
dont you owe me that
and she turns
her eyes go first to her sleeping child
then she walks over and sinks to the sand
just before him
near enough to touch
she looks in his eyes
im like a dying person
the words just came out
his eyes move over her face
his aching for her is naked beyond his ability to cope
i dont sleep
i tell myself this cant go on but it goes on anyway
he seems at the edge of insanity
i did a terrible thing ishmael
i knew what you felt
and what i didnt
sadness in her voice
but strength as well
and i never found the courage to tell you
his eyes swim with tears
he chokes them back he has to
youll think this is crazy but all i want is to hold you
and smell your hair
she absorbs this
no sign of repulsion or anger
her eyes seem wise
and very sad
you have to hear this i can never touch you ishmael
not once not ever
theres no half way
as much as i know it hurts you you have to let this go
look i want to forget you i do
i think if you hold me just this once i can walk away and never speak to you again
she just keeps looking at him
there is a bravery to her steady gaze
her calm resolve
as one human being to another just because im miserable and dont know where to turn
i need to be in your arms
if its just for thirty seconds
his pleading look holds her for a moment
in the silence
i hurt for you
whether youll ever believe that or not
feeling behind her eyes
first time she lets it show
i feel sick sometimes with the guilt of what ive done to you
and i cant make it right
she rises slowly
brushes the sand from her skirt
to hold you would be wrong and deceitful
youre going to have to live without holding me that is the truth of the way things are
she takes one step back
get on with your life
and turns away
she gathers her baby in her arms
takes her blanket her umbrella her rake and her pail
he watches never moving as she gathers her things
gathers them as if he wasnt there
and with her back turned
get on with your life
she walks slowly away
her baby cries
close on a steaming soup kettle resting on a woodstove
a womans hand stirs with a wooden ladle
pull back to see
helen chambers slender and strong and keen
she is not yet
a code of fairness and self reliance is written on the fine boned features
i drove from the lighthouse to my mothers place
i brought her some groceries
beyond the window snow falls more heavily than ever
your father thought that heavy snow was gods kindness
despite the hardship it brought us beauty
ishmael at the rustic table
watching her back
and reminded us
of our place in things
not bitter but regretful that
you dont believe in god anymore
agnostics dont believe or disbelieve ma
we just dont pretend we know
she begins ladling the soup into big porcelain bowls
we dont know god we feel him
you felt him as a child
looks at him
thats a long time ago
what a child feels
she studies him silently for a moment
then brings the bowls to the table
spend the night will you
dont go back out into all that snow
sets them down
i felt milhollands report in my pocket
and wondered why i wasnt telling her
what id found
youve been busy with that trial i suppose
such a travesty
she takes her seat
as he watches her
they only arrested that poor soul because hes japanese
seattle boys think hes guilty
they say the evidence is rock solid
she begins to eat
eyes on her bowl
theyre not his neighbor like you are
he is a husband a father he risked his life for their country
the same as you
those arent the facts that matter
she looks up
straight to his eyes
well folks are pretty cold
and folks who believe in nothing else
theyre cold too
no mistaking her meaning
uneasy as always in the path of her disapproval
ive tried to understand your unhappiness all these years
having gone to war losing your arm
the directness of her gaze
he cant turn from that
but other boys came back
and pushed on
they found girls and married had babies
he doesnt flinch
his voice too quiet with
someday ill get lucky too
too quiet to conceal the hurt
she thinks it is hurt she has caused
it changes her tone to a plea
your father fought at belleau wood it took him years to get over it
nightmares tears b
but he found you
their eyes locked
it isnt the war ishmael
all those years growing up
you never had a real girl of your own
and now he looks down
he sees that his fist is tight around the handle of his spoon
and i know you have it in you to love
i know that much
i wish i knew more
his fingers open and the spoon clatters softly on the wood
ill stay tonight
thanks for asking
ishmael wanders through a silent room
a bed a dresser
work table and lamp
a room denuded of all decoration all possessions all sign of life
i came back from the war to this room
i stayed a few months
until my father passed
ishmael at the left sleeve of his dark suit of mourning pinned at the elbow
the diggers are filling a grave in distance
mourners mingle some casting glances back at ishmael
keeping their distance out of awkwardness rationalized as respect
one man comes to him
masato nagaishi is aging and frail
but his voice is clear
the japanese people of the island are saddened by this loss
your father was a man of great fairness and compassion for others
he stands at a respectful distance
ishmael clears his throat
he nods thank you
no words to say
so the small man adds
a friend to us
and to all people
they are a tableau of stone
and no more
the man takes a step back
we know you will follow in his footsteps
and honor his legacy
which changes ishmaels face
to something harder
i thought it then
and often since
a balance hes said
finding the facts
that folks needed to know
ishmael stands at an open closet
cardboard boxes have been set aside
one has been searched for treasure
the page is in his hand
only slightly discolored by age
these things are very difficult to say
i cant think of anything more painful than writing this letter
he closes his eyes
ishmael a murmur think of reading it
i dont love you ishmael
there is no more honest way to say it
he carries the letter to the twin bed
where he slept alone
thinking of her
whenever we were together i knew it
i loved you and i didnt love you at the same moment
he sinks slowly
as if beneath the letters weight
the last time
at the cedar tree
i knew we could never be right together
and that soon i would have to tell you
his eyes are dry
the letter has used up his tears long ago
this is the last time i will write to you
i am not yours anymore
he sets the letter on the bed beside him
i wish you the very best
your heart is large and you are gentle and kind
i know you will do great things in the world
he reaches now to his inside coat pocket
i must say good bye to you now
our lives will move on
the best we can
folded in quarters
sets it near the letter
milhollands report was like her letter
something no one else
would ever read
he stares at them
side by side
thing about having only one hand
its hard to tear pages up
and i wasnt carrying a match
he lies back
across the bed
so i thought of my father
the man who would have taken this report to judge fielding
tears stand in his eyes
but every reporter
chooses his own balance
finds the facts that matter
shuts the eyes
after all the freighter was only a theory
it proved nothing at all
there were other facts
we close on his face
the tightness of the muscles
tomorrow i would write a column
and she would be grateful
for my large
the eyes open they are blank
her husband would be judged
and she would be alone
at the future
the past looks different
hatsue miyamoto in the witness box
graceful erect her porcelain beauty accessible eager to cooperate
is the word i would use
and nels seems slightly surprised
but carl didnt say yes
he didnt say no
that was kabuos point
given how carls mother felt carl was still willing to consider selling to us
it was a good sign
nels considers that
well in the week that followed the week before carls death
did your husband pursue him
kabuo did not wish to beg he respected carls right to reflect
he was sure carl would do the honorable thing
nels right back and did he
her eyes bright
the night of the th kabuo helped carl at sea
with his dead battery
nels raises his eyebrows
to give the point its weight
right there on the boat they agreed
for the seven acres down
they shook on it
kabuo was so excited when he came home
nels lets that sit
and when did you first learn
that carl had drowned
the slightest pause
as if hesitant to confess
one oclock that afternoon from a clerk at petersens
nels turning to hooks your witness
and alvin hooks rises
perches on the edge of the prosecutors table
and looks at the witness with fairness and suspicion
your husband came home agitated after his encounter with the deceased
no impatience across her perfect features
only earnestness will do
i said excited
not agitated he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed
overjoyed yourself to hear the news
happy for him
so then you
and your husband
must have called friends relatives to tell them the amazing news
hatsue calm respectful no
didnt call your mother your sisters about starting a new life
your husband never tells his brothers that the family honor is vindicated
hatsue shifts in her chair
smooths her skirt
we hear how carl
only a few hours later
your husband returned at what seven oclock
closer to eight
so five hours
plenty of time for a call
he was excited you say
in the sense of being overjoyed
she nods he was
you would say conservative
there would be time for celebrating with others when a paper was signed
he allows himself that
you thought the deceased might
break his promise
of course not
were just not quick to run and boast
in case something went wrong
and then something did
carl heine was found dead
with his head crushed
she weathers that last part
as if taking no notice
yes and then what was there to call about
everything was up in the air
up in the air
was that your reaction
and he rises
i would suggest that more happened than a land sale evaporating
a man died mrs
a husband and father of small children had his skull bashed in
hatsue quiet dignity if you mean to imply that we were callous about carls death that is wrong and insulting
well did you come forward to tell sheriff moran what you knew
the encounter in the fog the
dead battery was it
we discussed that
and decided not to
she looks at him with the directness weve seen before
because the facts could be misconstrued as murder
but if truth was on your side whatever were you worried about
her eyes cut to nels
he smiles to blunt the harm shes done by looking to him for support
her gaze goes down now
straight to hooks
trials arent only about truth mr
even though they should be
theyre about what people believe is true
so you hid the truth
we were afraid
silence seemed better
to come forward seemed like a mistake
well it seems to me
nels gently objection
hooks can give his view in his summation
doesnt it seem to you mrs
miyamoto that your mistake was in being deceitful
concealing information during the course of a sheriffs investigation
it seems human
hooks raises his brows
i suppose that you mean this excuses concealing the truth
then why ahouls any of us believe you now
and in the silence
question withdrawn you may step down
youre implying th
no further questions
anger flashes across her eyes
her face colors
she draws a breath
thats enough mrs
miyamoto not another word
step down please
she looks to nels in her desperation and regret for making things worse
he chuckles and waves
its quite all right
she sits for a frozen moment
and as she rises
the boys in the reporters row are scribbling furiously
all but one
josiah gillanders folds his blunt thick hands across his belly
nearly sporting a walrus moustache and the watery dull eyes of an alcoholic he is a man ready to make the most of his fifteen minutes of fame
thirty years fishing alone
ever had an occasion to board another mans boat except in an emergency
maybe to socialize or some such
gillanders ready for this never
only boarded some fellas boat five six times in thirty one years
dead engine broken hip only in need
now mister gi
unwritten rule of the sea
we dont bother each other stick to ourselves
nels is wandering over to the jury box
now if you wanted to kill a man
think youd try boarding against his will and hitting him with a fishing gaff
its a joke
maneuver up to carls boat
tie your lines fast
all against carls will
its the stupidest suggestion i ever heard of
im sorry about that
it wasnt mine in the first place
even some on the jury
so the fishing gaff method wouldnt make sense
couldnt get on the boat
id just shoot the feller
then tie up throw him inta th drink
and skip bein the first gill netter in history to make a successful forced boarding
hooks at his table
now the sheriff believed that the d battery in carls well was carls own spare
even though it was too large f
no sense to have any at all
even the right size
its like having an extra battery in the trunk of your car
boat has two batteries
lose one you run off the other til morning
carl musta lost both so miyamoto there gave him one a his
course if carl lost both batteries dead in the water his radio wouldnt work
so how would he signal for help
compressed air horn most likely
hope to god some man hears you in that fog
all right what if the defendant heard so carl let him aboard to help
and then the fishing gaff
you mean miyamoto followed him out there and sucker punched him
well what if
now how is miyamoto gonna know in advance that carl loses two batteries
must happen once ever years or so
another chuckle or two from the gallery
thank you mr
thank you for coming down in this cold weather
well it does seem mighty warm in here
specially for mr
and looks at the prosecutor
who rises easily
a most polite fuck you smile
hooks strolls now
slow and steady
straight to the witness box
rests his hands on the rail
what if the defendant follows carl
and pretends his own batteries are dead
would carl tie up and help
and the smile on gillanders face
is the word youre groping for
do you agree that he might tie up to the defendants bo
so whys the d in carls well
whos to say
maybe it was just a spare after all
or maybe the defendant left it as a potential alibi
in case somebody saw him in ship channel bank
beat in case we put two and two together knowing of the hostility
between the families
actually thinking about that
my question is
could carl have tied up to help the defendant
a cleared throat
it coulda happened
and if i start to say its doubtful youd probly say no further questions right
once more laughter
enough to bring the gavel down
right about that
and right that it coulda happened
turns his back walks away
thanks for your help
hope the witness box wasnt too warm for your comfort
all eyes follow the prosecutor as he sits
except for the defendant
his stare forward
kabuo seated on the concrete floor of his cell leaning back against the wall
leaving the cot
for his guest
but the toughest scenario
is the one hooks will never raise
takes a breath
and whats that
that you came upon carl by accident
like you said
gave him the battery
like you said
asked him about the seven acres
like you said
he said no
that youd never planned
because youre not a cold blooded killer
im more a hot blooded killer huh
like a soldier
like a samurai
you wont hear that from hooks
because the charge is first degree murder which requires premeditation
he cant change the charge
do you understand
so if the jury thinks you did kill
but only in the heat of anger
they have to acquit
and you couldnt
kabuos face is stone
a warriors mask
you want me to say that
i want you
to tell the truth
there is no kindly smile tonight
no candy bars
you think that is the truth
i told your wife
trials arent always so much about actual truth
as about what folks believe is true
and its real
and what do you believe
cocks his head just to one side
a question first
why do you want to know
kabuo straight back because youre my friend
the old man thinks about that
studies his client
i believe you are a good man
who belongs with his family
and then the feeling comes
to the watery eyes
and i believe
you didnt do it
the sound of water
lapping at the hull of a boat
the mist drfits revealing
they are blue
the heavy brows above them dark gold matted and damp
my batteries are drawed down both of em
alternator belts were loose
pull back to see him
with his keroses lantern and his air horn
well pull one a mine get ya started
pull back to see him now leaning on his gaff
at the top of carls mast
we follow his gaze to see
you lashed up a lantern
gainst a fog like this
see it now
swaying as the helpless boat bobs in the night
lantern and a air horn
thats all i got without my juice
close on a battery well
one battery sits in place one spot is empty
the butt end of a fishing gaff bangs against the metal flange
and as the next blow is struck the huge hand
slips and the soft metal slices carls flesh across his palm
then smashes away twice more
we pull back to see
two batteries lie above the well
carl sucks the blood from his cut
then lifts kabuos d into place
dont know how long its take to get a charge
keep it tonight
well catch fish
ill see ya back on the docks
kabuo takes his gaff
heedless of carls blood on the butt end
carl looks up still crouching above his well
carl quietly hold on
you know as well as i do we got somethin to talk about
no response from kabuo
he stands above the larger man
im wonderin what youd pay for em
just curious is all
what are you sellin em for
why dont we start there
which makes the big man smile
just a little
did i say i was selling
but if i was id have to figure you want em real bad
oughta charge a sall fortune maybe
a slight shrug
of giant shoulders
maybe youd want your battery back
kabuo doesnt grin back
his face shows nothing at all
the batterys in thats done with
besides youd do the same for m
might do the same
i have to warn you bout that chief
im not screwed together like i used to be
kabuos face remains impassive
and the big man squints up into it
holding a handkerchief to his injured hand
hell im sorry okay
about the whole damn mess
if id a been around my mother wouldnt a pulled it off that way
he is sorry
and with that kabuos face eases
becomes like carls own
carl grins i was out there at sea
fightin you jap sons a bitches
kabuo no grin im an american
did i call you a nazi you big nazi bastard
carl softly not that i recall
i killed men who looked just like you pig fed german bastards
and their blood dont wash off so easy
still no smile
carl staring up
so dont talk to me about japs you big nazi son of a bitch
and kabuo chuckles right along with him
having kept his poker face the longer
i am a bastard
im a big hun nazi son of a bitch
and i still got your bamboo fishing rod
hid it from my mom
caught a mess a sea runs
damn things still in my closet
kabuo very softly you can have it
the hell with it
the look between them now
is very wonderful
in the subtlety of its connection
an acre thats what i paid ole wont take a dime less
you got no choice on that
didnt say i was buyin did i
what you want down
just bein curious is all
the handkerchief comes away from carls palm
and rising his hand extends toward the smaller man
a thousand down
well sign papers tmorrow
the hands grip
and they hold
and the length of this clasp and the straightness of their gaze and the silence of the moment
wash years away
and its a deal
close on eyes
they are asian
for the life of me sir i cannot imagine why you kept this story from the sheriff
pull back to see kabuo in the witness box
as my wife testified we were considering it
actually she said you had decided
decided not not come forward
kabuo quietly i was thinking about it
except even when sheriff moran arrested you
you said nothing about seeing carl
turns to the jury
at that point you were already under suspicion
the battery story explained things
if the story was true
and not simply something you thought up later
to the defendant
no reaction from the defendant
nothing anyone can see
sheriff said right off i was under suspicion
i didnt have a lawyer
but even after you had an attorney
you still claimed to know nothing claimed not to have seen carl
am i correct
well initially is an interesting word sir
youd been arrested you had a lawyer and you still claimed ignorance
i should have told everything right away
i know that now and i regret it
should have told everything
meaning you should have told the truth we can just discern the anger
at the edge of kabuos steady gaze
nothing to say
kabuo quietly i didnt know that was a question
it sounded like a speech
and hooks smiles
walks toward the witness stalking him
do you regret not telling the truth
i have told the truth
you mean this morning
the new story the battery story
that one is the truth
thats a question sir
kabuo even quieter yes
and i told it long before this morning
now what happened the day carl heine was found
before your arrest
i slept til one thirty when my wife woke me up with the news
we talked for a few hours
i left at six and went straight to my boat
didnt go anywhere else
no errands no purchases
just straight to the boat
thats the truth
hooks leans over the box
ever so slightly invading kabuos space
well the sheriff found two batteries in your well
if you left one with carl heine how is that possible
i had a spare battery in my shed
i brought it down and put it in just before the sheriff showed up
conveniently in your shed
only you didnt mention that a moment ago
why does this battery story change every time a new question is raised
kabuo looks at him evenly
you asked if i went straight to the boat
with the battery
hooks steps back
looks the witness over
youre a hard man to trust sir
you sit before us with no expression keeping a poker f
you know better than that mr
either ask questions that count for something or sit down and be done with it
the judge staring hard
hooks never flinching
shame on you
hooks turns his eyes to kabuo
stares him down so the jury can watch kabuos implacable stare in return
i apologize to the court for letting my feelings get the better of me
no other questions
well go to summation
as he returns to his table
as kabuo steps down from the box
the boys are writing as fast as their hands can move
only ishmael is not writing at all
he stares at the pad resting on hsi right knee
we close to see
one word circled
the word lantern
alvin hooks stalks the jury box now
prowls before them along the rail
as their eyes follow
believing that etta heines son would never sell him the land
land that in his mind filtered through ancient rules of behavior handed down from his ancestors culture belonged to his family by right
to make sure they understand
his only choice to get the land would be to eliminate carl heine
so that ole jurgensen would need a new buyer
pacing again hand trailing along the rail
in his mind
seen through codes of revenge difficult for us to fathom this was also the only way to avenge what he felt to be the grievous dishonor brought to his father
raises his finger
this must be heard
to a thousand years of ancestry in a foreign land we still find an enigma
despite our recent bitter experience with its ways
and stops once more
places his hands on the rail
thus believing cold blooded murder to be justified he trailed carl heine
could hear his engine in the fog
and sounded his own horn claiming distress
shakes his head ever so slightly
as carl pulled alongside please carl the defendant must have said
i am sorry for what has come between us but adrift here in the fog i plead for your help
and so this good man tied his boat fast while his enemy leaps aboard striking the treacherous blow he was trained to strike by his fathers hand
counting off the facts
one finger at a time
the feud over these seven acres had festered for eight years he argued with carl about buying the land one week before carl was killed
carls skull was crushed and his blood is on a murder weapon with which the defendant is a deadly expert spreads his arms
and after a series of lies the defendant at last admits he was there alone on the boat
in the fog
carl heines blood on his fishing gaff
looking into the eyes now
of each man
look clearly at the defendant
see the truth self evident in him
and in the facts of this case
so that they will follow his eyes to kabuos stone hard gaze
look into his eyes ladies and gentlemen consider his face
and ask yourself what your duty is as citizens of this community
pan the jury slowly as they hear
not a single witness has testified to anything that could suggest pre meditated murder
not in the days before carl heines death
or at any time
has anyone described a murderous rage toward the deceased
nels stands very still
hands resting on the rail
as calm and quiet as his adversary had been dramatic
etta heine had cheated his family
he had asked his childhood friend carl to sell him the land
and carl was considering it
just a little
there is no evidence of anger at carl much less rage much less murderous rage
no reason for premeditation and no evidence of it
he picks out a housewife
smiles sadly wisely
as her grandfather might
and yet the state is required to prove these things
his eyes widen
can you seriously think there is no reasonable doubt
why is kabuos d battery in carls well if carl was helping him why
why isnt the blood on the gaff more consistent with carls hand wound than a skull fracture
given the absence of bone or brain tissue
he begins to pace limping slightly eyes down
hooks asks you to believe is that no proof is needed
against a man who bombed pearl harbor
eyes on his feet
look at his face the prosecutor said
presuming that you will see an enemy there
treacherous by nature by a thousand years of something or other
looks at them
an argument i find as despicable as it is dishonest and twisted and insulting to us all
miyamoto is a much decorated hero of the united states army
for gods sake
the feeling wells in te old man
it bleeds through the very quietness of his voice
if someone said you should convict carl heine
or his lovely widow
because their ancestry is the same as hitlers
you would spit in his eye
yes you would
and every decent american
would applaud you
he leans his elbows on their rail
as if confiding to them across their backyard fence
now kabuo miyamoto did one thing wrong
he was afraid to trust us at first
afraid that he would be crucified by prejudice
hooks is urging you to do
well we sent him
and his wife
and thousands of americans to concentration camps
they lost homes belongings everything
we did that folks
can we now be unforgiving about his uncertainty
looking in their eyes
as if waiting for an answer
they shift their weight fidget beneath his gaze
you may think this is a small trial
in a small place
well it isnt
he straightens his spine
winces slightly with the pain of it
every once in awhile
somewhere in the world
humanity goes on trial
every once in awhile common folks get called on to give the report card for the human race
the eyes are watering
but the voice gains strength
now here in america
we relish those chances
give us that one we say
thats why we built this country in the first place
one step back
just above a whisper
make your children proud
close on handcuffs snapping into place
sheriff moran checks their snugness about kabuos wrists as the crowd mills through the courtroom in the wake of adjournment
grasping kabuos arm moran begins leading him toward a small doorway just at the rear of the witness box
someone is there
in the doorway
and morans grip tightens as they approach
im awful sorry maam but you know i c
what are you afraid of sheriff
the edge on that the ballsy undertone throws him a little
am i going to slip him a weapon for a mad escape
perhaps a kendo staff hidden in my dress
well please break them then
i wont keep you a moment
and she reaches past him
to take her husbands hands
she looks in his eyes as if they are alone
i love you
and tomorrow when i make our bed
im setting out your pillow
tears just flood her eyes
she holds tight to her smile
and to his hands
hatsue whispers you better be there
a lovely easy cowboy american smile
only if you ask me nice
from the gallery
one man watches
watches as a woman brings manicled hands to her lips
and walks quickly away
straight toward us in fact
and when she stands before us her hands mangle her purse
the eyes are hollow flint edged
did you write that column
but the jury wont s
its not for the
they only get to convict him
she arches her throat
as if facing a firing squad
its the judge who decides
if hell hang
his fingertips find her shoulder
she does not resist his touch
ishmael gently none of that is gonna ha
you dont think he did this
his hand comes away
from his heart
i know he didnt
her eyes filling
moving over his face
come to supper tonight
my mother would be proud to have you with us
he hears the emotion in her voice
he swallows hard
no i cant
tell your mom
i want a rain check
kabuo sits on the cot the way we have always seen him
alone in his mind
kabuo oblivious far away
the door clangs open
you have a visitor son
turns to the visitor
you said three minutes
wont take two
and moran leaves
the door clangs shut
they are alone
only one man smiling
please sit down
but the tall man doesnt
she told me youre writing a column
were very grateful
ishmael nods awkwardly
said you two go way back
ishmael stares into kabuos earnest smile
you said there was a lantern in his hand
when you found him in the fog
the mans tone is formal
as if the offer of friendliness is somehow rejected
and another one
lashed to the mast
kabuos own smile has faded
the mask has returned
and kabuo grins
in spite of himself
if i did the math right
ishmael leans back
against the door
its the sheriffs math
im wondering about
the sound of wind
of water lapping at wood
click of a key springing a lock
the scrape of a large padlock sliding away
a door creaks open and from the sound of it a large one
gray light seeps in
thats all it is
see them now
three silhouettes framed in thr barns open doorway
against the night sky
i call it keeping your promise
we said if i ever needed some cooperation from you
a soft click and the lights go on
such as they are
a few bare bulbs strung across the rafters of this towering ramshackle enclosure
a year old mildewed barn built of creosoted timbers
this is a place for overhauling boats with sea doors facing the harbor
two boats are tied to wide elbowed piers
weve seen them before
you threatened me chambers pure and simple
and what idiots gonna believe some cock and bull story that i made a deal to keep stuff outta your paper
not that anybody reads your paper
abel martenson leads the way
along soaking planks
same idiots wholl believe you cracked this case
when i tell em you did
points up to the cross spar high on the mast of the first boat
see no lantern
abel respectfully sheriff
thats miyamotos boat
moran swings his gaze up to the second boat
moran quiet triumph no lantern there neither
no lantern on the cross spar
they keep walking
never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place
its public record
if the public cares enough to read it
they step across the gunnel
onto carl heines boat
flashlights working against the dim eerie glow of distant bulbs they enter carls cabin
neat as a pin
ishmael scans the floor
you said there was a coffee c
abel sorry i picked it up
and points to the cup
sitting on the counter
its the only thing i moved i swear
it was right there
the sheriff glares at the boy
you wanna see that in the papers dont ever touch something at a cri
because ishmaels gaze has gone to a kerosene lantern
in the corner
like the inventory says
sorry to disappoint you
but ishmael is out the door
shining his flashlight
up the mast
i was hoping you got it right
whats that up there
and they all squint up
shining their lights together
along the cross spar
bits of string
thats what it looks like
many of them
pieces of twine arent nothing
and he steps to the base of the mast
puts the flashlight in his pocket
wraps his arm around the shaft of wood
here now what are you fixin to do
have a look
and wrapping his legs around the mast he hoists himself up
you cant go up there touch things
with all his strength
ishmael begins to climb
ishmael grunting trials over sheriff its with the jury now
supporting himself with his legs he struggles upward
you gonna climb that with one arm
i better use two
up he goes inching his way abel shining his flashlight
moran swings his beam up too
theres lots of em art look
and moran is looking
now ishmael is there
a dozen or more all figure eights
all cut clean through on an angle
and look at that streak of rust across the mast
his light playing on it
bracing his full weight with his legs ishmael fingers the scraps of rope
its on the twine too
but its not r
dont prove there was two lanterns
coulda been the one in the cabin
still supporting himself with his legs ishmael pulls out his flashlight
theres a stretch of ground between guessin and provin sheriff
ill give you that
shines it down on the deck
along the gunnel
just below the mast
and as we watch the circle of light move
what do you think youre lookin at now
and in the silence an absent
not what im looking at
its what im looking for
eleven citizens around a walnut table
glaring at the twelfth
i guess it comes down to a feeling dont it
if i feel uncertain i feel a doubt isnt that it
and the boat builder smiles amicably rubs his gray beard
no other smiles
alex nobody aint ever sure about nothin
its un reasonable to be so stubborn that you think youre smarter than eleven folks who all agree the man sat there and admitted he lied mr
now why isnt that enough for you
were not tryin him for lying
lots of us told lies one time or another
probly none of us murdered anybody
but what drives a man to lie
means hes hiding somethin
not necessarily that he killed carl
im not sayin youre wrong just that i have my doubts
look if you changed chairs right now cos you doubted that maybe a chunk of the moon was gonna fall through the roof that wouldnt be reasonable doubt
folks turn to burke
what the hell are you talking about
alexander van ness laughs okay you win that one
now can we all go to bed
harlan mcqueen the mooring line
doesnt that tell you something
i think it does
miyamoto was on carls boat or vice versa
not much doubt about th
marlan mcqueen and carls blood on the gaff
theres a chance it came from his hand
theres a chance of everything
but you add a chance from here and a chance from there the world aint made a coincidences only
look if he gave carl a battery like he said hed only a had one left
he explained that
he replaced it
harlan mcqueen only he threw that part in when he got cornered
but first time around he never mentioned it
alex stop arguin just to argue
you can see what really happened same as us
isnt that what were supposed to do is tell the actual truth
my god carl died here
so i dont care carl died unless im ready to reach for the hangmans rope
you oughta stop tryin to bully me into hurrying
little anger in that
it brings a silence
been six hours
you sayin theres a way to go slower
nels in a ratty frayed old robe pouring hot water from a kettle into mismatched cups
his hair is wispy and wild his eyes puffy
he coughs horrible
clears his throat
and drops tea bags into the cups with a splash
ill give you that
lisps over to the cluttered table
where his guest is waiting
its the way it happened i know it is
no you dont
ishmael removes his bag
sips his tea
about the freighter
you didnt find that tonight did you
ishmael keeps sipping
holding eye contact
you went right to the cell
then to the boat
how long did you know about the freighter
ishmael just above a whisper one day
to sip his tea
this tastes horrible hmmn
youre wondering why i held it
im wondering how the judge is gonna like my waking up his old bones
in the middle of the night
and he smiles
a wonderful smile
was quite a feller
yes he was
hes looking down
and hes not thinking bout the man you were yesterday
hes proud of the man you are tonight
thats what counts
to my father
nels watches the pain in that
what if i told you he once said to me
dont matter the road we take
just so we get there
ishmael smiles then youd be lying
doesnt make me wrong
the jury once more in the jury box
pan their faces
the faces we saw last night
all right lets say that twine had been there to lash a lantern
that it had come from the shuttle of twine found in the deceaseds pocket
alexander van ness
now to re open a trial that had gone to jury
new evidence should be pretty important
on the witness stand
tell us why that lantern would be so significant
it shows the prosecutor was wrong
it was carls boat that was dead in the water
or hed never have put up the lantern
nels thinks about that
so the jury will too
now you believe there were two lanterns when defendant arrived
one in carls hand
the second lashed to the mast
thats what mr
miyamoto reported and hed have no reason to lie
he couldnt know that it would help his case
well why does it
because the second lantern the one on the mast
was never found
so we have to ask
a slight shurg
stating the obvious
where did it go
maybe it went
where carl went
over the side
nels smiles his grandfather smile
your honor all of this is speculation
hooks dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call
tht was summation your h
judge gently overruled alvin
lets hear this hmmn
nels gudmundsson nods to himself
takes a stroll over to the jury box
no limp today
something has put some spring in his step
so how does this fit with what you told us at the start
the freighter that plowed through ship channel bank
leaning his scrawny butt against the jurys rail
hell watch this with them now
thats when he fell
ishmael settles in
here we go
miyamoto gave him the battery and left
carls boat was running he goes back to fishing
but at some point he thinks of the lantern
still lashed to the mast
he figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there
so he climbs up
to cut it down
just as the freighter comes through
isnt that quite a coincidence
you run a yellow light just as a car comes out of nowhere
split second tragedy happens every day
maybe carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio which is now working
same report milholland heard
and that makes him get the lantern fast
before the freighters wake can bang it around
but you could be wrong
he could have climbed up earlier
then wheres the lantern
and wheres the knife
as if he really has forgotten
as if he wants to know
coroner found an empty knife sheath on carls belt
but they never found the knife
yes thats right
he climbs up
his hand wound still bleeding
thats the blood i found on the mast
and the twine
nels eyes are rapt
his mouth is shut
no way he interrupts this roll
he cuts the lantern free the freighters wake hits the boat rolls hard his bloody hand slips tracing blood along the mast
the lantern the knife go into the water
same as carl
the words hang there
and inside the cabin a coffee cup falls off the counter
shakes his head
but theres no one around
to pick it up
puts his hand to his chin
still a coincidence
timing and all
the freighter started through at
the sea water seeped into carls watch and stopped it
cut to the defendant
ramrod straight nothing revealed in his face
and to his wife
her eyes flooded with tears
still and all
carl was a strong swimmer he m
he hit his head
on the way in
you think so
the sheriff and the deputy and i inspected the deck closely
we found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel
just below the mast
well anything coulda caused that
no smile at all
that had a blond hair
and nels is walking now
toward the prosecutors table
pulling a small cellophane bag from hisinside pocket
request introduction of exhibit
one single blond hair
which sheriff moran dug out of that fracture
below the mast
of carl heines boat
lays the bag on the table
just in front of hooks
turns to the judge
we will call sheriff moran who will confirm this
and coroner whaley to testify that the damage to the gunnel is of a size and nature not inconsistent with the deceaseds skull fracture
turns to the prosecutor
but for now
and just strolls on over to his seat
looks in his clients eyes
how bout them apples
kabuo loves this old guy
and right here he lets a little of that show
across the way the prosector is rising
friendly almost amused
i have to start reading your paper more closely
youre quite a storyteller
ishmael straight back thank you
coming from the man who wrote but here adrift in the fog plead for your help
thats quite a compliment
there is a ripple of laughter
but no smile on ishmaels features
his game face is on
come and get me sucker
and hooks does come one step at a time
straight to the box
everything had to happen just right
for your little story to fly
i mean a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a lot of reasons
im sorry was there a question in there
no love lost
and no pretense about it
hatsue miyamoto sits with her hand in her mothers
watching these men battle for her husbands life
well the freighter
the second battery
the phantom lantern
the fishing gaff
the cracked gunnel
the skull wound
the blond hair
thats eleven things
i stand corrected sir
and you have a neat explanation for every one of them
yes you do
and since you confess this is all pure guesswork
what is your expertise sir are you a detective of sorts
is that im a journalist
right at his eyes
finding the facts folks need to know
the words ring with quiet heartfelt conviction that others cannot fully appreciate
then putting them together
so truth is revealed
but isnt the truth that there are several other ways to explain each of these twelve pieces
and the prosecutor stops
confused for an instant by this confession
but no other way
to explain them all
a heart stopping hush
as everyone as hooks himself sees the cehckmate
and since they all happened
this is the only explanation thats the truth
the prosecutor looks like hes been slapped
like every act of will is necessary to maintain composure
to find the easy untroubled smile
your line of work
you must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth
like you couldnt believe
hooks leans in
well the defendant is a liar
hes confessed that much
and his explanation is
he was afraid
and leans in some more
afraid that the good folks of this jury
would be too stupid to understand
too prejudiced to be fair
shakes his head
you buy that
ishmael gently i think he was greedy
and once more
the prosecutor can only blink
can only move toward the trap
he didnt want to lose any more
no smile as the trap springs shut
hed lost a lot in the war you see
i had sent him away
to a concentration camp
but a nice one
far less brutal than the nazis
because im a civilized person
lets hooks clear his throat
i asked you a question youre writing a tract h
thats how journalists
turns to judge fielding
with all respect
may i answer the question your honor
anout the defendants motivation to lie
i wouldnt miss it for the world son
now you say you sent the defendant to manzanar
i didnt say
i did it alone
and things get real quiet
so there he was
his father lost his health there finally died
they lost more than etta heines seven acres
they lost their liberty their dignity
their ideals about this country
so much feeling in this
he has to stop
they lost their trust in us
we had treated them worse than animals
how would we now see tham
as human beings
tells the jury
straight to their faces
this man lost a lot in the war
he didnt want now to lose his babies
or the woman who loves him
another level of quiet
he turns to the prosecutor
and my expertise in this sir
is that i lost a lot in the war myself
words coming from someplace very deep
and the fact that i am the only witness
who placed his right hand upon the holy bible
is the least of it sir
i assure you of that
i hate to spoil the soliloquy i truly do
but the fact is
you are not on trial here
nor is judge fielding or myself
nor the good people of this jury
for events that took place twelve years ago
and i wouldnt blame these good people if they were a mite resent ful
at a tactic that insults their intelligence
i was appealing to their intelligence
were you sir
can you prove one word of all your fancy story
no sir i cant
not beyond a reasonable doubt
and he smiles
its fortunate that the man who needs to prove his fancy story
beyond a reasonable doubt
is someone else
there is laughter in the room so welcome is any chance to relieve the tension
the gavel bangs
im sorry mr
i apologize for my tone
this is not a contest
between you and me
shakes his head
no it isnt
for it is not
gudmundsson so wisely put it
a small trial
in a small place
his eyes are damp now
strangely enough after all this
he is at last on the brink of losing control
i lost more in that war than anyone will ever know
so did a lot of folks
and what we got back in return
his voice breaks slightly
but it rings with dignity on
was a country
where a man was innocent
until we proved him guilty
and the voice drops
to just above a whisper
whether we all got cheated
were about to find out
close on hatsue miyamoto speaking earnestly her eyes down her purse in her lap her slender hands expressing the intensity of her feelings as she makes her point and we
pull back to reveal that she is on a corridor bench surrounded by a half dozen reporters who are crouching standing scribbling away
two photographers pop flashes that she does not seem to notice as she continues with refined determination and we
pull back down the hallway to the pov of a man who sits alone unnoticed
there is an unopened pack of cigarettes in his only hand turning absently in long strong fingers that crinkle the pristine cellophane
his eyes are fixed to hatsue holding court at a distance
fixed as if no other sight could ever command this level of attention
all things considered
hearing the voice ishmael looks down
uneasy to have been caught staring so intently
you were adequate
no smile accompanies the irony
for that would be condescending
i could make a few quibbles but i am loathe to hurt your feelings
the old man sits
ill take two
one for later
ishmael tries to tear the cellophane without success
nels seems not even to notice
nels quietly she is simply
ishmaels eyes cut to him
a little quickly
ive always thought so
there it sits
his fingers claw absently at the cellophane
nels makes no move to intervene
if i whistle
those boysll see you and come runnin
youre the story today
you ever been strangled by a single hand
naw ive seen what that can do to a pack of cigarettes
in this hour of discomfort
ishmael brings the corner of the pack to his teeth and tears the cellophane away
better take three
fingers nimbly shred the seal open the pack
maybe theyll keep us waiting
shake the tips free
holds the pack forward
nels very quiet maybe they wont
the way he said that
ishmael watching nels face as the old man takes two cigarettes
prejudice is like any obsession
tucks one in his pocket
and his eyes slide unmistakably to hatsue
theres a reason why we cant let go
even when we want to
ishmael is stone still
nels just gazing at hatsue
nels simply we dont want to
looks back to ishmael
hate or love
it works the same
in the silence
your clients wife ever mention
we go way ba
nels softly her mother
may have said something
there it is
kindness in this old mans face
he brings the other cigarette to his lips
and ishmael takes out the match box
never breaking eye contact
we dont let go you s
its a rare thing
takes a turning point
expertly ishmaels fingers withdaw a match
you gave this jury three chances
palming the box ishmael strikes the match
on his belt buckle
no other way to explain it all that was one
i caught some of em fluttering waking up on that
reaches the flame toward the old man
you sent him to manzanar and you didnt do it alone i liked that one they didnt
nels leans to the flame
sucks it in
savors a drag
you gave your arm
to buy this woman back her husband
are they gonna cheat you out of that
calling out everywhere the buzz rises there is motion an expectation
but nels doesnt seem to notice
some let go some dont
where did you
asked so casually
hatsue is standing now surrounded by people her mother grasping her arm
ishmael a murmur hooks called her deceitful
and i knew she wasnt
hes watching her
across the way
she was an honest person
doing the best she could
we follow her approach toward the courtroom door
she has not yet turned to us
the prosecutor the judge cut her off
she was desperate
her husband helpless
i was helpless
with great effort
you couldnt let her
ishmaels eyes still fixed to hatsue grim faced listening to her mothers murmurings as she
disappears through the door
never having looked our way
when this verdict is read
she may look for your face
and ishmaels eyes come up
because the voice commands it
heres what she needs to see this is nothing
we win it on appeal
the old man is stern and strong
he wants a promise
itll be there
the hush of a hundred silences
we can feel the air crackle in the stillness
judge fielding is leafing through papers
no one coughs no one blinks
judge clears his throat mister foreman has the jury reached a verdict
he looks up
across the distance harold jensen rises in the jury box
we have your honor
and holds out a slip of paper
little more than a scrap
will the bailiff please bring the verdict to the bench
the bailiff does so walking crisply to minimize his moment in the limelight
he hands the slip to the judge who unfolds it and
staring for a hung instant
as if seeing something unexpected
he folds it again rather carefully thoughtfully and as he hands it back to the bailiff
judge softly will the defendant please rise
kabuo and nels rise together
but it is only into the defendants eyes that the judge stares
no expression in the face of either man
but something passes all the same
as the bailiff crosses to return the verdict to the foreman we reverse angle
every pair of eyes in the room are on the foreman now opening the slip of paper
will the foreman please read the verdict aloud
one reporter stares across the grain of all other sight lines
toward a woman who does not see him
in case she needs his eyes
to be waiting
harold jensen reads we the jury find the defendant kabuo kenji miyamoto to be not guilty of the cri
a sharp scream and the defendants mother in law covers her mouth in embarrassment
harold jensen continues of the crime with which he has been char
applause breaks out from the back row of the gallery where citizens of japanese ancestry have forgotten custom and decorum as has
a woman who comes out of her seat tears on her face not even realizing she is standing hatsue clings to the railing that separates her from her husband
throughout the gallery now
some of the citizens assembled add their applause
others look awkward not knowing how to react
the gavel lies untouched unnoticed by a jurist who has no problem with anything that is taking place right now
saying only to the jury
this is your verdict so say you all
as they assent
this court thanks you for the good work you have done under difficult circumstances
reaches strong to the gavel turns to the defendant
go home son
cracks the gavel on its block
the defendant is out of his chair and with one strong grip of gratitude to the frail shoulder of his counsel he is
at the rail through the popping of flashbulbs she is in his arms the embrace so fierce on both sides everyone crowding around them
an old mans eyes sweep the gallery looking for someone
only to find
as he disappears through the door
the miyamotos holding court surrounded by nearly twenty reporters and photographers and countless looky loos of all persuasions
hatsues face is flushed and intense unsmiling she seems scarcely to have caught her breath
she holds tight to her husbands hand as he
carries his baby son in the other arm his year old daughter leaning against him her year old sister standing on the bench beside her mom
kabuo submits to questions with a boyish grin of humility and friendliness
an american family
photogenic as hell
and how about the jury
you had confidence theyd see justice done
kabuo glances to his lawyer wanna field this one
but nels sends it back with a twinkle
these are our neighbors you know
theyve got good hearts
we could see they were following the evidence real close
at his side hatsue seems to be scanning the jumble of faces
were just grateful to every one of them
looking for something she doesnt find
and you maam
you felt the same as your husband i expect
her eyes move to the eager young man
she reflects for a beat
which catches everyone
a little short
hatsue quietly i felt my husband would be found guilty
unless proven innocent
no apologies for the truth
thats not her way
chambers did that
a vending machine stands in silence
the eerie strobing glow of defective neon
pull back as
ishmael thinks it over
drops in his dime
pulls the plunger to watch a snickers fall
scoops the candy from the tray pins it between his body and the machine
tears the wrapper
back to the reporters
the crowd of onlookers has grown
can we get some background on your handsome family
i understand you two were childhood sweethearts
and brings his parker pen to his notepad
his subject smiles easily
well no sir not exactly
we met in the manzanar camp you see so i guess that was the most beautiful place ive ever been
there is gentle laughter
and as kabuo looks up he sees something in the rear of the crowd
something we do not
no her first love was another fella
which brings hatsues eyes up following his gaze
and there in the back
a man watches
eating a candy bar
i was the lucky one
no one sees their eyes lock
it is only an instant
it is enough
it all sounds very romantic maam
falling in love under those circumstances
and as she looks to the reporter ishmael begins to walk away
he went off to the army right from manzanar
and that last night we danced alone in the desert
and somehow ishmael catches the eye of hatsues year old daughter
so he pulls a coin from his pocket
i told him
if you dont come back alive ill kill you
ishmael rolls the coin across his knuckles
and the child responds
with her mothers smile
alone on the steps where the strawberry princess once winked at him
snow has begun to fall soft and altogether beautiful
he squints up
gods kindness my father said
despite the hardship
it reminds us
of our place in things
our place in things
he slides a black cigar between his teeth
what the hell
did he mean by that
he has the match box
manipulating it with the dexterity weve come to know
things fall on us i suppose
from the sky
strikes the match on his belt buckle
freighters plowing through
cupping it expertly in a single motion he brings the flame to the cigar
a single puff
and we seem
until we understand
accident rules every corner of the universe
down the steps
snow swirling between us
except the chambers
of the human heart
