written by carl theodor dreyer joseph delteil translated by oliver stallybrass at the bibliotheque nationale in paris it is possible to see one of the most famous documents in the
history of the world the official record of the trial of joan of arc
the bibliotheque nationales original record of the trial of joan of arc is shown on the screen
an invisible hand turns over the manuscript pages
if you turn over the pages yellow with age which contain the account of her martyrdom
page after page is shown of this unique document with its lines as straight as arrows its marginal annotations and the naive miniature drawings for which the notaries have found
time and space
you will find joan herself
not the military genius who inflicted on the enemy defeat after defeat but a simple and natural young girl
who died for her country
the last pages are turned
then the picture disappears and gives way to the first scene of the film which shows the prison where joan is sitting praying
the flagstones the floor in joans cell
we see two straws and a hand joans hand which lays the straws on the floor in the form of a cross
scenes from the church are shown the chalice is brought out
in the prison we see joan kneeling before her straw cross this most fragile and exalted of crosses
she prays in ecstatic joy at one moment bending right forward so that her forehead touches the flagstones the next moment kneeling with her hands folded and her eyes raised
to heaven as if she saw beings visible only to her
from time to time she mutters a short prayer
a young monk makes his way through rows of kneeling priests
he is the usher massieu who is on his way to summon joan and conduct her to her first examination
joan in front of her little cross
suddenly the two straws spin round in a mysterious gust of wind
what is it
joan sits for a moment overcome with astonishment then puts the straws back in the form of a cross
again a hostile power attacks this cross and scatters it over the flagstones
joan doesnt know what to believe
can it be one of her voices
a divine intervention
once again she replaces the cross
then there is a roar of laughter from the door behind her
joan turns and sees three soldiers who have been standing in the half open door blowing at her straw cross through a long tube
enter the soldiers
they are tormentors and bullies of the worst kind
they continue to jeer at her
now the jailer appears an elderly man followed by a blacksmith
joan turns in terror and looks up at them
when she sees the chains in the blacksmiths hands her eyes fill with tears and she shrinks back a step
the jailer seizes her by the foot and the blacksmith puts the ankle chains on her
while he is thus occupied massieu enters
he is an engaging young man of twenty five healthy vivacious and open he radiates youth health and life
he remains standing by the door until the others have left the cell
the jailer who goes out last certifies that the prisoner is the maid
the door closes behind the jailer
and now that massieu is alone with this woman whom he has heard described as a dangerous witch and an object of fear he is afraid
he prays inaudibly and crosses himself
he has brought with him a small stoup and aspergillum and as he stands by the door he sprinkles joan eagerly with holy water
joan who has dragged herself over to the boards which serve as her bed looks at him in gay surprise and with a slight smile says come a little nearer
i shant fly away
massieu astonished approaches her asks if she is joan the maid and when she confirms this begins to read the summons that you summon the aforesaid joan commonly called the
maid to appear before us
joan declares herself ready to follow him
massieu calls for the jailer
they lead joan out
bishop cauchon takes the chair for the trial
to either side of him sit the inquisitor lemaitre and jean destivet who is to present the case against joan
these three men are surrounded by the other forty one clerics all men of learning thoroughly versed in the art of dragging confessions out of accused persons
a special table is reserved for the notaries
cauchon gives orders for the accused to be brought in
every face turns towards the entrance
they all see joan for the first time
it is so quiet in the chapel that you can hear the grating noise of the chains round joans ankles
joan comes forward
through the pointed colored windows the sunlight falls obliquely into the room in long shafts
suddenly joan finds herself in the middle of one of these shafts and stops for a moment
she becomes aware that every eye is turned towards her she sees that they are hard cold and uncomprehending
for a few seconds it seems as if she is going to collapse overcome by the cold remorseless atmosphere
on one side a completely human simple young country girl on the other the flower of this centurys talents learned doctors the fine fruits of the university every prodigy in
the instruments of reason and of death
the personification on one side of innocence on the other of magnificence
the terrible relentless way in which they look at this girl in mans clothes all these bishops all these ascetics and members of orders with their newly cropped tonsures
these learned gentlemen regard her mans shoes and short hair as something loathsome and indecent
they believe as one man that it will be all easy matter to get the upper hand over this child
with a harsh movement cauchon orders joan over to the seat for the accused
she remains standing for a moment drooping under the heavy burden of her chains
then she sits down
her face is pale and marked with grief and suffering
she lets her eyes wander over these rows of men in clerical garb alone and unaided she must battle with them to save her name and her life
she leans towards massieu and says a few quiet words to him as if to remind him of some promise
massieu says to cauchon the accused begs humbly for leave to go to confession
the bishop who is engaged in thumbing through some documents which one of the prelates loiseleur has just brought him discusses the request briefly with the inquisitor and replies that
he is obliged to deny her this favor because of her indecent dress
then he opens the session and orders joan to take the oath
with a gesture he indicates that the bible is to be fetched and placed in front of joan
she kneels folds her hands over the book and recites the oath i swear by the holy gospels to speak the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth
concerning the mission which has been entrusted to me by the king of heaven
there is a hush in the room
at this moment when everything is quiet a small door opens giving direct access to the castle from the chapel
it is warwick the english governor and general who enters
the respect shown to the new arrival by some of the soldiers in his vicinity suggests that he is a person of some importance
as the commander in chief of the english army of occupation he is the real though unrecognized driving force behind the trial
he has come for the purpose of speeding things up but he keeps in the background like an accomplished butler who supervises from a distance and sees that everything is
for the moment he remains standing just inside the door presently he comes further forward and is hidden by columns
at one point we see him in conversation with loiseleur
joan has sat down again and the hearing begins
cauchon asks joan her name
she answers at home i am called jeannette
here they call me joan
cauchon asks her age
joan thinks and counts on her fingers nineteen
cauchon after smiling to his neighbor asks can you say our father
scenes from her childhood come rushing into her memory
her eyes are moist with tears and when cauchon asks who taught it to you
joan can hardly produce a word for her sobs are lying like a knot in her throat
she answers so softly that hardly anybody can hear my mother
the promoter jean destivet whispers to cauchon
tell her to say the our father
if she refuses it will be evidence of her being possessed by the devil
cauchon nods and tells joan to say the our father
jean destivet and cauchon exchange glances
cauchon tells her urgently to do his bidding but joan refuses again for she is afraid that memories of her mother and her home in domremy are going to overwhelm
cauchon puts further pressure on her she is to repeat the our father immediately and unconditionally
she declines to do so
cauchon rebukes her for this stubbornness and lets the examining judge take over the interrogation
the latter makes an inclination of the head and asks you say that you are sent by god
joan confirms this with a nod and adds to save france
the judges burst out laughing
joans eyes are raised to heaven as if it was heaven that gave her courage and found the right words for her
her expression which is filled with the glory of a heavenly vision is almost unearthly as she answers that is why i was born
more contemptuous laughter from the judges
the examining judge confers with the other judges
their expressions show that they are setting a new trap for joan
finally he says so you believe that god hates the english
joan does not immediately understand the question and the examining judge has to repeat it
then joan gives one of her brilliant inspired answers i know not whether god loves or hates the english
disappointment on the judges faces
joan continues with a strength which suddenly reveals a new side of her character and turning towards the english soldiers
but i know for certain that the english will all be driven out of france
commotion and protests among the soldiers why should joan be allowed to insult england
but joan continues inflexibly except for those who are going to die here
the soldiers are furious
they can no longer contain themselves
one of them makes a movement towards the accused
massieu leaps to her defense
but cauchon intervenes and orders silence he has to use all his authority to restore order among the judges
the hearing continues
cauchon asks you have told how saint michael appeared to you
how did you greet him
joan explains that she has always greeted saint michael in the way one should greet a saint
one of the judges tells her to show how she greeted saint michael
with touching simplicity joan kneels goes through the motion of taking off her cap and bows reverently before the imagined saint
she gets up again while the judges talk together
cauchon continues in what form did he reveal himself
joan does not immediately grasp the question
half the judges shout to one another
hundreds of questions fly across the room did he have wings
was his head like an ordinary mans
was he wearing a crown
under this deluge of questions joan makes a movement as if to say that she cannot answer them all at once
finally when quiet is more or less restored cauchon formulates his question more carefully what was saint michael wearing
but joan does not answer
an elderly canon is seen to rise go over to the bishop and whisper something in his ear
there is a suggestion of pruriency about this man
the bishop nods and turns to joan
how can you know whether the person you saw was a man or a woman
joan is silent
she realizes that another trap is being laid for her
cauchon is reluctant to give up the ground he has won
he asks a new question was he naked
every ear strains to hear the reply for now joan has to answer
and again she produces one of her brilliant careful answers do you not believe that god would have clothes for him
cauchon realizes that his stratagem has failed but nevertheless he pursues the matter further did he have any hair on his head
but joan who now feels that she is on firm ground smiles and answers with artless inspiration why should he have had it cut off
cauchon sees that he will get nowhere with joan by this method
he confers with those sitting nearest him and then gives way to the examining judge who begins to question joan about her dress why are you wearing mens clothes
joan refuses several times to answer and remains sitting motionless stiff as a ramrod
the judge says are you willing to wear a womans dress
massieu leans towards her and advises her to accept this suggestion which he thinks must be very easy for her to do
but joan looks at him with the air of one treasuring a great secret and says no to the judge
when the judge presses her to tell him why she refuses she answers when i have completed the task which god has entrusted to me then i will wear womens
whispering among the judges
an indication that another trap is being prepared
then one of the judges says so it is god who has commanded you to go about in mens clothes
joan answers unhesitatingly yes
a smile of triumph spreads from face to face among joans judges
the promoter jean destivet complacently makes some notes
then he leans forward over his desk smiles and asks in an insincere tone of voice and what reward do you hope to obtain from the lord
joan whose expression is that of a saint folds her hands on her breast and raises her eyes to heaven the salvation of my soul
she remains sitting in the same position her look conveys the impression that she can see into the furthest corner of heaven
but jean destivet is incapable of controlling himself
he gets up goes right up to her spits in her face and hisses do you not understand that what you are saying is blasphemy
then he goes back to his place
but on joans face there lingers the expression of one who is far removed from this world
from time to time throughout this episode two of the judges nicolas de houppeville and martin ladvenu have been seen to show signs of sympathy for the accused
after this last outrage on the part of the promoter de houppeville can control himself no longer
provoked to the limit he rises and shouts this is unworthy
the whole room turns to him in amazement
he continues fearlessly it is persecution
he leaves his place ladvenu tries to restrain him but he approaches the bishop and says to him we are treating this woman like an enemy not like a human
being on trial
then he casts a look full of tenderness at joan who at this moment is drying her cheeks still wet from jean destivets spittle
houppeville continues for me she is a saint
he goes over to her genuflects before her and turns to go out through the door
warwick has followed these proceedings with an attentive eye
he whispers a few words to an officer who follows houppeville the length of the chapel
when he reaches the porch the officer takes two soldiers with him and follows on houppevilles heels
each of the judges in the room understands the fate in store for houppeville and is seized with fear
an icy unquiet silence prevails
paul jorge the name of one of the actors prepares to rise and ask the meaning of this incident
cauchon stops him with a movement and gives the order for the session to continue
he asks joan has god promised you anything
joan gives an absent minded nod
cauchon presses her to tell him what it is that god has promised
can you not tell us what it is that god has promised you
cauchon asks with his most ingratiating smile but joan shakes her head
cauchon tries to persuade her you must tell us
but joan declines to answer that has nothing to do with your trial
cauchon maintains the contrary and joan tells him to ask the assembly
cauchon turns to the judges and asks
has this question any bearing on the trial
he orders those who consider that it has to raise their hands
nearly every hand goes up
then it is the turn of those who take the opposite view
ladvenu is the only one to raise his hand but when he sees that he is entirely alone he takes it down again
and cauchon is able to say to joan that since the relevance of the question to the trial has been unanimously agreed she is obliged to answer
he repeats his question what has god promised you
joan does not answer
cauchon continues has god promised you that you will be released from your prison
joan confirms this with a nod
dalleu speaks in a low voice to cauchon who asks when
after sitting for a while lost in thought joan answers i do not know the day or the hour
a further exchange of words between cauchon and destivet then cauchon makes a sign for massieu to take the accused back to prison
joan rises to go
she takes a few steps turns and asks may i not be relieved from carrying these chains
cauchon can see no reason for complying with her request
but he sees the opportunity of imposing a condition which he knows will be unacceptable to joan will you take an oath never to bear arms against england again
joan answers unhesitatingly no
then she is led away
her chains clank as they drag over the flagstones
the judges leave their places
they break up into groups according to their friendships or the order to which they belong
we see one group consisting of dominicans another of canons a third of mendicant friars
the entire assembly talks and whispers
monks cloaks homespun tunics and cowls caps and hats
here a fat old abbot here a short slim monk
respectful inclinations of the head sanctimonious smiles violent outbursts of laughter
the witty ones recognizable by their thin lips and legs
in the background beardless students solemn as popes in earnest discussion
but round the judges table a discussion is going on between cauchon lemaitre jean destivet the learned thomas de courcelles loiseleur beaupere pierre maurice and warwick
warwick stays in the background as if wishing to underline that he has no part in the conspiracy against joan but it is clearly understood that he has the last
word in the matter
they are considering what procedure to adopt
the point is to lose as little time as possible in getting joan to compromise herself
loiseleur propounds a scheme which receives general approval
warwick is asked a question which he answers in the affirmative
an order is given to a secretary who at once leaves the chapel
massieu has brought joan back
the door closes behind her
overcome by fatigue she sits on her bed
in front of the judges she has restrained her weeping
now that she is alone the pent up tears pour from her eyes
the conference is still going on
loiseleur is dictating to the notaries
at intervals one of the other judges interposes a word or a suggestion
joan is still shaking with sobs
suddenly she sees a cross slowly forming on the floor close to her feet
it is the shadow of the window grating
she knows this cross and loves it
it always comes when she is feeling lonely and unhappy
she has no doubt that it is god who sends her solace and encouragement in this way
she dries her eyes and produces from a hiding place a piece of handiwork with which she occupies her hands and her thoughts when she is not before the judges
it is a crown of plaited straw very simple pretty and childlike
soon she is completely absorbed in this work to which she devotes all her love
we see the joan from domremy who is second to no woman in rouen when it comes to spinning or sewing
from time to time she looks at the cross on the ground
the conference in the chapel
loiseleur finishes his dictating
the notary reads back to him
we see only joans hands which are occupied in plaiting her crown
the shot is taken in such a way that the crown and the cross on the ground can be seen together
the conference in the chapel
the notary finishes his reading aloud and what he has read is approved
meanwhile the secretary has returned
he hands a document to warwick who passes it round
it goes from hand to hand and finally to the notary
in the little ante room leading to joans prison
the soldiers are playing with a small english dog
an old serving woman comes with food for joan in an earthenware bowl
one of the soldiers seizes the bowl he selects the best piece of meat and gives it to the dog
the latter swallows the meat and licks the soldiers fingers
with the same fingers he picks out another piece of meat and gives this also to the dog
a short scene from the conference featuring two documents
a hand that of the notary is engaged in copying the signature from one document to the other
the soldier comes in with joans food followed by the dog
two other soldiers appear in the door for these rascals never lose an opportunity of tormenting their victim
as the soldier hands joan the food his eye falls on her ring
he demands it from her but she implores him to let her keep it it is her mothers ring
but the soldier is determined to have it even if he has to use force
he calls to the other two soldiers to come and help him and puts the bowl of food on the ground in such a position that the dog naturally takes
advantage of it
just as the first soldier has finally succeeded in forcing the ring from joans finger loiseleur appears in the open door
he appears to be filled with genuine indignation at the sight of the ill treatment to which the three rascals are subjecting joan
the soldiers have turned round
they are afraid
loiseleur threatens them and quickly goes up to the soldier who has wrested joans ring from her
the soldier is compelled to hand over the ring to loiseleur who thereupon orders the three ruffians out of the cell
loiseleur shuts the door
he is alone with joan
he looks all round him and goes over to joan who regards him with deep amazement which embraces gratitude as well for after all it is he who has just
saved her from the soldiers cruelties
he remains standing a few paces from her looks at her in a serious and friendly way and says i have great sympathy for you
a feeble smile appears at the corners of joans mouth but her expression of astonishment remains
loiseleur has stopped by the cross when he takes a pace forward the cross disappears but joan fails to notice this absorbed as she is in wondering why this prelate
has come to visit her
loiseleur who has now come right up to joan hands her the ring which she receives gratefully
then she again fixes her look of enquiry on the prelate whom she has previously seen among her judges
finally he says to her in a low whisper would you recognize your kings signature
joan nods though without understanding the purpose of his visit
from his cowl he produces a letter which he hands to joan
she takes it
she shows with a smile that she recognizes charles viis signature
then she returns the letter and says i cant read
loiseleur reads the letter aloud for her as follows to our dearly beloved joan
charles the king hereby informs you that he is preparing to advance on rouen with a mighty army
he is sending you a faithful priest who will stand by you
have confidence in him
the reflection of an inner joy shines in her eyes
her face lights up during the reading and she smiles
loiseleur does not move from the spot
he stands watching her motionless and pale
he gazes at her with the eyes of a snake while joan sits with an absent smile completely absorbed in her own joyful thoughts
loiseleur suddenly raises his head and pricks up his ears
immediately behind the cell wall there is a secret room where a man can remain hidden spying on the prisoner through a judas or chink in the wall
alternating with the scenes between joan and loiseleur are close ups of cauchon spying and eavesdropping behind the chink
loiseleur moves away from joan and goes towards the hiding place he is perfectly aware of its existence
when he reaches the chink he and cauchon look at each other
first cauchons serious eye is shown through the chink then likewise through the chink loiseleurs small cunning contracted eye
loiseleur catches sight of the crown and says your martyrs crown
then he turns to joan who is still sitting with the kings letter in her hands
he offers to hear her confession
she turns to him with a look of joy hardly daring to believe in this happiness
she drops a pretty curtsy then kneels with folded hands in a charming attitude suggestive of a penitent child
he advises her strongly to speak to him with an open heart
here she is not before her judge but before her king
god can hear her
joan confesses her sins like a schoolchild reciting a lesson
cauchon and his attendants follow the scene attentively from the secret room
with a ledger on his lap the notary takes down everything that joan says but it is clear that she is saying nothing of any significance for all the skill
with which loiseleur presents his questions
so it is not long before loiseleur gives her a sugary smile and rattles off the absolution
he makes the sign of the cross over her and stands up
cauchon and his confidants have left their hiding place and now come into the cell
the soldiers bring in chairs and a table for the scribe
the judges group themselves in a circle round joan some sitting others standing
loiseleur places himself behind cauchon
in addition to the judges massieu also is present
cauchon gestures to lemaitre who says to joan you profess to be a daughter of god
joan agrees with a nod and lemaitre continues then why will you not say our father
joan sits motionless for a moment
the judges look at her with watchful eyes
a perceptible change comes over joan
her expression is transfigured
a heavenly light spreads over her face she folds her hands and begins to pray
the sight of this small and helpless woman turning to god in captivating innocence makes an involuntary impression on some of the judges
the gentle massieu in particular can hardly restrain his tears
joan has said the our father
jean destivet is thus obliged to eliminate this important point from his charge sheet
lemaitre continues with the hearing has god told you that you will be released from your prison
joan smiles and gives loiseleur a secret confidential glance
his eyes gleam back at her in complicity
she answers yes
and by means of a great victory
the judges are astonished and cross examine her
they ask her to explain precisely what she knows and how she has come to know it
but joan answers i know that god will soon come to my help in a miraculous way
jean destivet hastens to write down this important answer
with great secrecy he grips loiseleurs hand in gratitude
cauchon lemaitre and some of the other judges plot together
lemaitre leans forward and begins to question her has god promised you that you will go to paradise
joan knows instinctively that they have laid a trap for her
in her uncertainty she looks for help from loiseleur who indicates to her with a slight smile that she is to say yes
lemaitre is satisfied with her answer but takes good care to conceal his satisfaction
in a tone almost of boredom he says so you are certain of being saved
again joan resorts to loiseleur
he gives the same sign as before and joan says yes
massieus eyes are as if riveted to joans lips and now when she answers yes he forgets where he is forgets that cauchon is just beside him and almost without
thinking says to joan do you realize that this is an extremely important answer
cauchon pounces on massieu and bursts out you had better hold your tongue
massieu wants to explain but cauchon cuts him short and orders the hearing to continue
lemaitre presents his next question which is only one link in a chain of questions carefully prepared and ingeniously related since you are so certain of your salvation
why do you need to go to confession
joan is already floundering in the net
she has the feeling that her answer may decide her destiny
she is like a hunted animal that looks for the smallest gap in the chain of beaters in the hope of escaping its pursuers
the judges never take their eyes from her
ladvenu and massieu are the only ones whose faces show signs of sympathy and compassion
loiseleur seeing that his plan is working out to perfection gives cauchon a slight nudge with his knee
there is a pause
lemaitre realizes that the moment is ripe for presenting the final question which will settle the issue are you in a state of grace
for a few seconds it is so still that you could hear a pin drop
joan tries to catch loiseleurs eye but he adroitly avoids meeting her look of entreaty
joan is obviously at a loss how to answer
but then the honest and fair minded massieu moves convulsively forward and shouts dont answer joan this question is too dangerous
cauchon enraged rises in all his majesty and bellows with the full power of his lungs
be quiet will you in the devils name
massieu defends himself
he explains that nobody has the right to ask such a question of an accused person least of all when the accused is a young girl standing on her own
with nobody to advise her
but cauchon will tolerate no insubordination
massieu is forced to kneel there and then and ask for pardon and must consider himself fortunate not to share de houppevilles fate
when peace is restored cauchon gives orders for the hearing to continue
lemaitre still seething asks answer now
are you in a state of grace
joan opens her mouth to answer but appears to have second thoughts and remains silent
she looks in the direction of loiseleur who is apparently absorbed in his own reflection
he is abandoning her to her fate
in his view she is a certain prey whether she answers yes or no she is doomed to perdition
but now that joan has collected her thoughts again she gives this admirable answer if i am not may god put me there
and if i am may god so keep me
joan has broken the chain of beaters
she realizes this and smiles
but her judges who have sat there greedily waiting for the prey to fall into the net so that they can hurl themselves on it these judges now sit not
knowing what to say or where to look
they gaze at each other in speechless amazement
some of them unconsciously make the sign of the cross
loiseleur is beyond doubt the most disconcerted
all of them feel that they have suffered a defeat
this battle is lost now they must try to win the next one
a short conference takes place
the judges rise to go
joan throws herself at cauchons feet embraces his knees and begs him i implore you to let me come to mass
cauchon thrusts her away so brutally that she hits the bed
she remains lying on the floor
loiseleur has hastily stolen over to cauchon and is whispering something in his ear
cauchons face lights up
he whispers to the others letting them in on loiseleurs plan
then he approaches joan and says to her in his mildest voice
joan if you were allowed to go to mass now
joan looks up at cauchon
her eyes are already gleaming with hope and expectation
cauchon continues would you consent to give up your mens clothes
when joan hears this condition her hope is extinguished as rapidly as it was kindled
her expression reflects the deepest disappointment
her judges repeat cauchons question but she declines their offer
one of them helps her up
she sits on the bed and all those taking part in the session crowd round her saying that she must adopt the dress which is appropriate to her sex if
she wants to obtain so great a blessing and if she wants to live up to her pious feelings
finally cauchon says then you would rather keep your mens clothes than come to mass
joan explains through her tears that she is not allowed to do otherwise i cannot do anything else
it is not in my power
but cauchon unable to control his anger persists this shameless costume
joan tries in vain to make them understand that this form of dress does not pollute her soul with sin and that wearing it is not in conflict with the
ignoring joans remarks cauchon rages abominable in the eyes of god joan writhes under these denunciations she implores him to show mercy but he scourges her pitilessly you are no
daughter of god
joan weeps and sobs
cauchon shows no sympathy
he lowers his voice bends right over her and hisses but a child of the devil
joan cries out and collapses
the judges watch her for a moment
ladvenu full of sympathy
then cauchon turns to massieu and says go and prepare the instruments of torture
massieu can hardly believe his ears
are they really going to torture joan
but a look from cauchon prevents him from saying anything
he goes out through the door giving joan a look of compassion as he does so
the soldiers who have witnessed the examination escort him out and in the ante room they reproach and abuse him why did you make signs to her and give her
they threaten to throw him into the seine if this happens again
the judges leave joan loiseleur being the last to go
before he leaves the cell he approaches joan and pats her hair sympathetically do not grieve
place your trust in god he will not forget you
joan turns her tear stained face to him full of gratitude for his kind words she kisses his hand
then loiseleur goes out
joan is left in solitude for a mere moment before the soldiers enter in order to bait her in their usual manner
joan takes no notice of them
one of them tickles her in the ear with a straw
joan gets up laboriously and sits down on the bed
one of the soldiers suddenly catches sight of the straw crown
he laughs picks it up turns it round in his hands and finally places it on joans head
outraged by this form of sacrilege she removes it and puts it on the bed but the soldier replaces the crown on her head at the same time giving her
several slaps in the face
he steps back and peeps through the hollow of his hand as if to see her better
the other soldiers roar with laughter and say in mocking tones she looks just like a daughter of god eh
he takes an arrow from his quiver and places it in joans hands
she lets him do this without resistance
another soldier takes a pitcher of water and sprinkles joan with his fingers
all three bow low before her as if she was a saint and finally kneel and say saint joan pray for us
then still bowing they step back and go out
joan sits for a moment by herself
without changing her position she prays silently to god
she is praying to the almighty for strength and courage to endure her trial by torture
he is to fetch joan and bring her to the torture chamber
he is amazed at finding her decked out in this way but he gives her such comfort as he can and leads her out
the judges have already arrived and are taking their places
they consist of pierre cauchon lemaitre and nine doctors and prelates
the two executioners maugier leparmentier and his assistant are putting the instruments in order and making other necessary preparations
enter massieu with joan
she is told to come nearer
cauchon tells one of the younger judges to bring a stool for joan
the judge who helps joan to her seat says look
at all these kind sympathetic men
he points at cauchon who sits surrounded by his collaborators
not one face expresses any feeling of friendliness towards the accused
the judge continues do you not consider that these learned doctors are likely to be endowed with more wisdom than you joan nods half absent mindedly
the judge is pleased with his happy idea and is about to continue his course of instruction when joan interrupts him but the wisdom of god is even greater
the judge who has spoken to joan as one speaks to a child which stubbornly refuses to listen to reason shrugs his shoulders and gives up
there is nothing to be done about this womans arrogance
cauchon has raised his hands to his face outraged by such obstinacy
now he leans forward in his chair and says with great emphasis suppose we were to tell you now that your visions did not as you believe come from god
joan looks up quickly as if unable to believe her ears
she searches the faces of her judges one after the other
cauchon continues but are sent to you by the devil who wants to bring your soul to perdition
joan sits for a moment deep in thought
then a smile spreads across her face
almost unconsciously she shakes her head and smiles again
assuredly the devil has no power over her and is not going to obtain it either
one of the judges asks if the devil appeared in the form of an angel how could you be certain whether it was a good or a bad angel
for a moment the smile fades from joans lips
she does not answer
cauchon looks at her for a long time and then says it is satan to whom you have knelt not saint michael
joan finds this idea so comical that she has to laugh
she cannot help herself it is not a provocative laugh only the spontaneous laughter of a healthy person
but cauchon strikes the table in anger
joan stops laughing
cauchon gazes fixedly at her for some time without saying a word
there is complete silence in the room
cauchon gets up approaches joan in a dignified manner leans towards her and says how can you believe that it is god who guides your steps when you see the
abyss opening before your feet
joan is serious again
cauchon continues pronouncing the words with steadily increasing emphasis do you not understand that it is the devil who has turned your head
he pauses briefly then continues who has deceived you
then after another short pause and betrayed you
while cauchon has been speaking a change has come over joan
it is clear that she is tormented by doubts
god has promised her that she will be set free
why has god not kept his promise to her
why does he let her stand alone against all these churchmen these learned doctors
she even asks herself whether she has the right to talk as she does in front of all these gifted and erudite men
is it true that she is full of pride
is it the devil who has possessed her and insinuated in her mind everything that she believed to have come from god
cauchon judge of character that he is has no difficulty in seeing what is going on in this young womans heart
while joan is wrestling with her doubts he orders a small table to be set in front of her
he puts a document on the table and then places a pen in her hand
half absentmindedly she lets him do all this but when cauchon tries to persuade her to sign she tells him that she is unable to read
cauchon tells the notary to read the declaration aloud i declare that i am guilty of the crimes with which i am charged and which the devil has misled me
i confess that my visions are the work of the devil and i am ready to return to the path of truth and before all the world to recant
when the notary has finished reading aloud cauchon tells joan warningly that she must sign the declaration and adds the church is opening her arms to you
joans expression makes it clear that she has almost overcome her doubts
her faith in god and belief in her mission are on the point of gaining the upper hand
cauchon threatens her but if you do not sign the church will turn her back on you and you will stand alone
joans crisis is over
once again she sees clearly the path she must follow
quietly she puts away the pen
cauchon sees this and thunders alone
but a heavenly light shines from joans face
with her eyes raised to heaven she says alone with god
cauchon realizing that his prey is about to escape him increases his exertions and displays all his powers of persuasion
does she know that the church has the means to compel her
is she familiar with the secrets of the torture
cauchons threats make no impression on joan
she feels safe with her god
her face is transfigured by a beautiful light as she says i would rather die than deny gods acts
enraged by joans pig headedness cauchon loses patience
he orders joan to be put to torture
while the executioners are taking care of her the judges gather together in a group
one instrument of torture after another is displayed for joans benefit
with an executioner at her side she is conducted past the various appliances
she looks at each one for a long time trembling with fear
occasionally the executioner demonstrates with a gesture how one of the instruments is operated
they are trying to frighten joan out of her senses
when the executioners have completed their preparations and the torture can begin cauchon goes up to joan and invites her once again to sign the declaration
she refuses and says even though you torture my soul out of my body i shall confess nothing cauchon gives orders for the torture to begin
joan lets out a scream of pain
she is seen to raise one hand
they all think she is indicating her readiness to sign
a judge holds the document out to her but joan thrusts it away so violently that it falls on the ground
somebody picks it up
and joan says vehemently and if i should confess anything i will afterwards declare that it was only by using force that you made me confess
the executioner bends over her
she has fainted
the executioner and massieu carry her out while the judges confer on what procedure to adopt next
massieu has gone on ahead to notify joans keeper who sends a man out with a message for warwick
massieu prepares joans bed and takes the little crown in his hands he looks at it for a moment then flings it into a corner
enter the executioner and his assistant carrying joan between them
they lay her on the bed and go out
before massieu leaves the cell he gives one of the soldiers instructions to keep an eye on joan
the judges confer
cauchon thinks the torture should continue and asks the judges to vote on this proposal but only one of them is in favor of continuing
this is loiseleur who says it is medicine for her soul
ladvenu gives loiseleur a look of hostility
joan is lying on her wretched bed
the chains the brutal soldiers terror fatigue and finally the torture have exhausted her strength
she is unrecognizable
her face is as white as a sheet
deep shadows under her eyes
when the scene opens she is lying in a feverish doze
she breathes rapidly and with difficulty
a soldier with a hard repellent face is watching at her side
joan opens her eyes and says i am thirsty
the soldier looks at her with an unfeeling hostile expression
then he takes the bowl of water and pours the water over the floor
the judges have not yet concluded their conference
they still seem unable to agree on whether the torture shall continue or not
however master erard wins a majority of the votes when he declares this heart is much too hardened
there is no hope of our getting a recantation this time we will have to wait
a confession would be valuable even if it was subsequently withdrawn
but erard continues and she might die at our hands
cauchon yields to this argument
even loiseleur defers to erard and admits that it would be very damaging to all their interests if joan died at the hands of the executioner
she would then be certain to enjoy a martyrs glory
having decided to give up the torture they leave the torture chamber
he goes over to the bed and bends over joan not with any feeling of sympathy
joan opens her eyes for a moment and meets his cold hostile gaze
then she relapses into her state of lethargy
warwick goes from the bed towards the door which he has left standing open behind him
two doctors whom he has sent for come into the cell
he follows them over to the bed where he speaks the famous words which for sheer brutality are without parallel in history i would not have her die a natural
death on any account
she has cost me too much for that
the doctors begin to examine joan
they feel her thighs and right side
meanwhile warwick has gone from the sick bed over to the door
enter loiseleur with the news that cauchon is waiting in the adjoining room
warwick is about to go when one of the doctors approaches him and says she has a fever we shall have to bleed her
warwick shows signs of unease and asks whether this is really necessary
the doctor insists that it is
warwick consents adding but take good care that she does not do away with herself
she is very crafty
the doctor turns back to the bed to prepare for the blood letting
warwick accompanies loiseleur into the adjoining room where cauchon and some of the other judges are waiting
cauchon enquires after joan
warwick answers in a manner which cannot be misunderstood she is very weak
the two men exchange glances
cauchon and the judges have come to extort a confession from joan
whether because they were afraid of her escaping in this way and dying without having made a recantation or because her weakened physical condition raised hopes of her soul being
easier to purchase
cauchon explains to warwick how he wants to proceed
loiseleur joins in the discussion and proposes a drastic remedy
cauchon approves loiseleurs idea and tells massieu and another young monk to fetch the holy vessel
while this is going on scenes are shown from the sick bed and joans blood letting
one of the doctors goes out in order to report that the blood letting is finished
the patient is better and can undergo examination without danger
cauchon loiseleur and some of the other clerics come into the cell
warwick remains with the doctors in the adjoining room
joan is lying with closed eyes
cauchon goes over to the bed and bends over joan with a benevolent paternal expression
he touches her on the temples
joan opens her feverish eyes
he asks her in a friendly manner how she is
she makes a movement with her head and at the same time gives a feeble smile
her eyes shift from cauchon to the others what is going to happen now
she is evidently taken by surprise
cauchon guesses her thoughts calms her and says we have come to give you comfort and strength
a tiny glimmer of gratitude passes over joans face
cauchon and the others install themselves sitting and standing round her bed
cauchon with the same benevolent air and kindly smile asks whether joan has anything to say to him whether perhaps she has any wishes
joan holds him for a long time in her gaze which the fever has made still more penetrating
then she makes a feeble movement with her head
cauchon arranges the pillow under her and comes close to her in order to hear better
joan whose labored breathing makes it difficult for her to speak says in a weak voice
i am afraid that i am going to die cauchon speaks some words of consolation to her in his capacity of priest
joan continues if i should die i implore you to have me buried in consecrated ground
joan tries to read the answer from cauchons face she sees only utter benevolence and charitableness
in addition all the judges now seem full of affection and sympathy
they tiptoe round her bed first one and then another coming close up to her
they tuck the blanket round her and touch the place where she has been bled
some of them kneel and pray for joan
she regrets not having been more amiable towards these men who are revealing their true feelings now that they see her in such misery
she feels every confidence in them and in cauchon
he has caused her great suffering now however he appears no longer as a judge but as one who has come to show her goodness and compassion
and when cauchon strokes her hair and says the church is merciful
joan smiles trustfully
cauchon continues she does not close her heart against those who return to her
joan in her weakened state does not know how to express her gratitude
she squeezes cauchons large hand in her tiny one which is absolutely white
but cauchon says in a gentle voice what would you say if we gave you the sacrament
joan cannot believe her ears
she asks one question after another which cauchon answers only with nods and his paternal benevolent smile
joan has to find an outlet for her joy and with her two small hands she takes cauchons great fist and places it against her cheek
cauchon signals to loiseleur who opens the door
enter massieu with the eucharist
cauchon helps joan sit up in bed
beside herself with joy and anticipation she follows the preparations and keeps looking at cauchon with gratitude
then she says joyfully i am a good christian
the judges in the cell send up a prayer of thanks to god for restoring this lost sheep to the fold
joan smiles happily
then the notary places a document in front of joan and offers her a pen
joan looks in amazement at the document which she recognizes it is the same declaration which was placed in front of her for her to sign during the torture scene
her look of astonishment shifts from the notary to the document and from the latter to cauchon
she explains once more that all the accusations in the document are what god has commanded her to do
she cannot recant like this without denying her god
cauchon bends over her and says the sacrament
is it not a great blessing
joan nods and her expression seems to want to say of course everybody knows that the church has no greater treasure
cauchon continues but you will never share in the churchs blessings if you do not expiate your sins
he indicates to joan that she must sign
one of the judges approaches with a wafer
an expression of misery and pain lies on joans face as she sits there sick feverish and racked with doubts
on one side she sees the wafer which is more precious to her than life itself on the other side the document which will make her confess that she is
an agent of the devil
as if talking to herself and her conscience she says i am a good christian
as she sits there alone with all these men she is the picture of utter despair and loneliness
they all gaze at her with fixed stares
nobody speaks to her
finally cauchon breaks the silence
in a quiet voice he advises joan to sign and save her soul but joan has now mastered her temptation
she hands back the paper
her body is broken
but the strength of her spirit is unaltered
for a moment they are all struck dumb
cauchon gestures ordering the sacrament to be carried out
the tears run down joans cheeks when she sees the priests going out with the sacred vessel
i love god
i love him with all my heart
loiseleur who has accompanied the procession into the adjoining room tells warwick the outcome
in the cell the atmosphere has changed abruptly
cordiality is replaced by coldness gentleness by severity
the judges are overcome by a feeling which can almost be called irritation irritation with joan and what they call her pig headedness
jean destivet reproaches her harshly for allowing her vanity to take precedence over the salvation of her soul
he concludes with these words if you die in this hour you die as an infidel
joan goaded by the mental torture to which she has been subjected answers in words conjured up by her sancta simplicitas but jean destivet revelling in the pain his speech
has given joan obliterates her with the wounding words which sting like the lash of a whip your soul is doomed to perdition to which one of the others adds to everlasting torture in the flames of hell
groaning under the burden of the injustice and malice they are heaping on her joan turns for comfort to cauchon whose hand she has just pressed to her cheek but
cauchon has no comfort to give
he draws back and says coldly joan you are a child of the devil
she looks at him in unaffected terror
then it is as if a veil gradually falls from her eyes as if the whole truth is revealed to her in a flash of lightning
they have lied to her in order to trap her
in her overwrought and exhausted condition she loses all self control
fever and ecstasy take charge of her features
as a stream of reproaches pours from her lips they all gaze at her in terror is this the last flare up before death is it madness
all of them feel themselves face to face with something unfamiliar and extraordinary
slowly they draw away
cauchon rises and backs round his chair
foaming at the mouth joan continues to pour out a torrent of words you say that i am a child of the devil
and she continues but i say it is you who have been sent by the devil to torment me
she stands up in bed pointing at each judge in turn
a violent storm of anger breaks out blasphemy
she is possessed
this is monstrous
the judges huddle together in their agitation and terror and gradually withdraw
and now joan falls back on her bed exhausted
she groans and gasps for breath
she wipes the sweat from her forehead with her sleeve
for a moment there is silence
only her groans can be heard
the judges look at each other not knowing what to do
then they turn to cauchon who is pondering
it is he who breaks the silence with the following words addressed to massieu there is nothing for it
give the executioner his orders
while the doctors who have entered during the preceding scene are attending to joan the judges leave the room
by the time the judges come out into the castle yard there are already rumors of what has happened in the cell
the inhabitants of the castle crowd round to hear the news and learn of the preparations now in hand for the penultimate act of the drama
from the castle yard a small door leads out to the churchyard which lies outside the castle walls
the judges make for the churchyard
some soldiers have come with a stretcher
they lift joan onto it and carry her out
one group of judges after another is seen moving forward to the spot from which they are to witness the impending ceremony
joan lying on the stretcher is carried into the churchyard
the churchyard which is surrounded by walls is very big but only a few graves can be seen in it
they are all covered with flat stones after the custom of the middle ages
in those days churchyards served as a meeting place at certain festivals and the judicial authorities of the church often used them as a stage for important announcements and abjurations
which they wanted known to as many people as possible they formed a theatrical setting with graves and gravestones as sets
a stench of putrefaction arose from this earth filled with dead bodies
the poisonous smell of nothingness
the smell of stones corpses and worms
against the buttress of the church two platforms have been erected and covered with red velvet
on one of them the entire assembly of judges is sitting in state pierre cauchon the inquisitor and a host of jurists in scarlet caps and purple skull caps
the other platform is for joan
escorted by english soldiers joans little procession comes slowly to this place
everywhere in the churchyard and even on the walls there are thousands of people heads jostling
the great majority of them are favorably disposed towards joan
when she is carried in every neck is craned to catch a glimpse of her
for her part joan tries to read her destiny in their faces
from the way they look at her she gets the impression that their feelings towards her are friendly
joan who for months has lived remote from this earth is visibly moved
she smiles at the tiny flowers which greet her from the grass
she almost touches them with her hand and imagines that she is caressing them
but when she looks in the other direction her eye falls on two gravediggers who are engaged in opening up an old grave
she sees the worms swarming in the skulls which are thrown up and she is filled with the fear of death
once more she ponders over the words which the members of the judicial body have addressed to her and she thinks sadly of her fellow countrymen who seem to have
forsaken her completely
the tiny procession approaches the platform reserved for joan
loiseleur comes forward to meet the procession and assist her
she smiles happily at this man whom she believes to be on her side
she is helped to a seat on a little stool
her face is as white as a sheet
she closes her eyes which have been hurting intensely bows her head and places her hands on her breast to all appearances indifferent to everything happening around her
erard massieu and two notaries take their places at joans side
loiseleur goes back to the larger platform where he takes his place near cauchon who now gets up and declares the session opened
joan for the last time i order you to abjure
are you willing to sign
joan sits motionless and expressionless
she hears nothing and smiles distantly
one of the prelates takes his place at joans side
he begins an admonitory sermon taking as text the words from saint johns gospel the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine
inspiring terror at one moment speaking sanctimoniously the next he warns he threatens he implores he mocks he calls her a cunning traitor cruel greedy a liar a heretic a
his anger rises in measure with his words and finally reaches a point where it overflows in a torrent
he is unquestionably a powerful speaker
but the stream of words appears to flow over joans head without touching her
the past and the present mingle in her thoughts yet nothing of what goes on around her escapes her notice
she looks towards the open grave
she cannot see the actual gravedigger only the earth which he is shoveling up from deep down
then she hears a shout of command
in the densest part of the crowd the soldiers are clearing a passage to allow a carriage into the churchyard
the new arrivals are the executioner and his two assistants
erard is enraged at joans apparent lack of interest in what he is saying
he raises his voice and shouts furiously this womans arrogance fills one with disgust
joans attitude remains unchanged
she does not move
erards voice trembles as he continues there has never been a monster in france like the one which has appeared in the form of joan
he pauses leans towards her and with a threatening gesture shouts at joan it is to you joan i am talking
it is to you i say that your king is a heretic
now joan turns towards him
she can withstand all his invective when it is her own person and her own honor that are at stake but this accusation directed at her king deeply outrages joans
love of france and of charles the king
her expression is one of anger and indignation as she says indeed my lord i am ready to maintain even at the risk of my life that my king is
the noblest man in all christendom
a ripple of applause can be heard among the spectators
the soldiers who are standing side by side in closed ranks turn threateningly
thrown out of his stride by joans answer the preacher embarks on a tirade which joan answers confidently finally not knowing how to respond he shouts to massieu make her
the spectators derive much derisive enjoyment from this little scene
order has been restored on the platform
massieu has persuaded joan to keep quiet
the preacher is approaching his peroration
he points to the judges and declares they have proved incontestably that joan has violated the churchs doctrines in deed as well as in word and asks her if she
has anything to say in answer to this
she reflects for a moment and while the spectators stand on tiptoe to see what is happening she rises to her feet and says i alone am responsible for everything
that i have said and done
joan draws a deep breath before continuing
all those standing round her gaze at her expectantly
then she says if have done any wrong i am to blame and nobody else
she sits down calmly
erard however is almost inclined to interpret her words as a declaration that she is now ready to recognize the error of her ways
he leans forward towards the notary who hands her a paper
several of the judges have come forward also one of warwicks secretaries
there is so much tumult and confusion round joan that she has difficulty hearing
sommaire explains it is the abjuration
joan does not understand what this means
what is the meaning of abjure
she turns to erard to ask his advice
explain it to her
erard orders massieu
the latter asks to be excused but after glancing at erard he does not dare to insist and is obliged to advise joan of the danger she will incur by
he says to her if you do not sign you will be burnt
among the crowd thronging the place the word burnt can be heard flying from mouth to mouth
around joan on the platform the air is filled with shouted words
joan asks massieu for advice he tells her that when the church advises her to sign she must do so
once again she turns to erard and asks him to tell her whether she must abjure
he answers either you sign or you will go to the stake
and he points at the executioner who at this moment approaches at a sign from warwick
now joan understands the cruel death in store for her and she is afraid
jesus christ also was afraid when he learned that his hour was come
fear has overcome her spirit and is affecting her feelings as well as her judgement with the threat of the stake hanging over her she now begins to consider the
proposition which has been put to her
almost unconsciously she turns her face towards the grave
she sees shovelful after shovelful of earth piling up
a human skull appears among the lumps of soil
worms are writhing in the eye sockets
the spectators shout sign joan sign
but she does not hear them
she is breathing heavily and feeling giddy
she looks vacantly at her surroundings like somebody coming out of a faint not knowing where he is
in a whisper which is barely audible to anybody but herself she says i have done no wrong
i believe in the twelve articles of the creed and in gods ten commandments
even erards heart bleeds at the sight of such deep unhappiness
his tone changes and his voice becomes almost syrupy as he says joan we have great sympathy for you
warwick gives a sign to the executioner who is approaching with a rope
now loiseleur mounts the platform and takes up a position on the other side of joan
he says to her in a low voice you have no right to die
you must continue to fight for france for the king of france
joan feels a pang in the pit of her stomach when he pronounces the name of her country and her king which mean everything to her and are never out
of her thoughts
the spectators follow with anxiety and deep involvement everything taking place on the platform
those standing round her who have witnessed her fear make all kinds of golden promises if only she will consent to sign
cries of sign sign
resound from mouth to mouth and loiseleur urges her earnestly to follow this advice
joan is dazed and no longer understands a thing
anxiously she explores the eyes of those standing round her
her terrible uncertainty is reflected in her expression
the moment has arrived when she begins to yield to the unremitting pressure
and when at this very moment the executioner rises up before her she surrenders
she casts a frightened glance at her surroundings then she slowly kneels and bows her head
sommaire seizes the document which has been placed in front of joan for her signature and reads it aloud sentence by sentence
sentence by sentence joan repeats his words smiling feebly and speaking in a peculiar mechanical way which betrays the fact that she is far away absorbed in her own thoughts
during the reading erard gestures with the pen to the larger platform to inform the judges that joan is going to sign
the tension among the spectators is at breaking point
the reading is concluded
joan gets to her feet
erard puts a pen in her hand round joan the excitement is palpable
people seem to be afraid of her dying
but joan is like somebody who has escaped from a great danger whose relief now finds expression in a tremendous joy almost resembling gaiety
she draws a circle explaining as she does so that she is unable to write
but this is not good enough for erard
so loiseleur steps forward and guides joans hand enabling her to write the word jehanne followed by a cross
when joan has signed erard with the document raised over his head gives a wink of triumph to let the judges know that he has succeeded in his task
the document passes from hand to hand until it reaches loiseleur who says cheerfully to joan you have done a good days work today
you have saved your soul
and he hurries away to give cauchon the document
among the spectators the tension is released in shouts of joy
but one or two english soldiers who have seen joans smile go up to her and shout at the priests around her she has only made fools of you
the priests push them away
cauchon who has received the document now gives a signal for joan to come forward and hear her sentence of judgement
joan descends from the platform leaning on massieu
in his enthusiasm one of the spectators forgets himself and bursts out long live the maid
long live france
two soldiers turn abruptly force their way through the crowd seize the unfortunate man who has given vent to his patriotic feelings and lead him away
joan has come before her judges great platform
cauchon takes the document from his secretary and begins to read it aloud in as much as you have at last renounced the error of your ways we release you
from excommunication from the church
cauchon pauses for a moment
joan stands before her judges with folded hands
a smile of gratitude is sketched on her face
she lowers her head to conceal her joy
then cauchon continues but in as much as you have rashly sinned we condemn you
joan looks up with an expression of fear and surprise
cauchon continues his reading
to perpetual imprisonment there to eat the bread of sorrow and drink the water of affliction joan stands for a moment dumbfounded
it is as if she cannot grasp the meaning of what she has just heard
she feels as if her heart is in her mouth
her eyes have the expression of a hunted animal
then she hides her face in her hands and weeps
cauchon gives a sign for joan to be led out
she staggers away leaning on massieus arm
joan meets the two soldiers who earlier maintained that she had made fools of her judges
they heap abuse upon her and massieu has to protect her
joan is escorted in by the jailer
he makes her sit down on a stool and starts cutting off her hair
joan is seized by a new and dispiriting fear
although she is in pain she manages to weep inaudibly sobbing without a sound
when her weeping eases off for a moment she whispers oh i am so tired so tired
but the jailer is concentrating entirely on his work
the locks of hair fall on the ground
joan weeps ceaselessly
the events in the churchyard pass in succession before her eyes but now she sees them in relation to one another from a new angle and with a sharper perception
she realizes that it is the fear of death which has caused her to panic
she regards what she has done as the greatest sin she has ever committed
she is unable to forgive herself for having told lies through fear of death
bitter are the tears which well from her eyes from sources almost dried up as joan asks herself how she may still atone for her sin and repair the damage
she has done
she turns to the jailer and says with an air of entreaty oh i am so tired
the jailer mumbles something incomprehensible
sympathy is not to be expected from this quarter
joan feels like an outcast it is hard to imagine a greater humiliation for a woman than to be shorn of her hair
and joan is a woman
at last the cutting operation is concluded
joan gets up and sits on her bed
she is like somebody who is on the verge of collapse from lack of sleep and who does mechanically whatever he is told
unconsciously she raises her hands to her face shudders and looks at her hands with dread as if they were unclean
she feels ashamed
what has she done
she has denied her god
she thinks of peters denial of his threefold denial before cock crow
the jailer who has left joan by herself for a moment now returns with a broom
almost without thinking and with a melancholy smile joan follows the broom as it sweeps up her hair hair from orleans and from rheims
the jailer sweeps it up onto a shovel
he glances round the cell to see if there is anything else he can sweep up while he is about it
his eye falls on the plaited straw crown the martyrs crown which has landed in a corner
joan sees the broom gathering in the crown
it is as if in this little incident joan sees a sign from god
she bitterly laments the glory she has lost by her abjuration
the jailer leaves the cell
joan sits by herself
she thinks of what she has done
this document signed by her hand is a denial a denial of god
how she wishes she could tear it to shreds
she is in consternation over the enormity of her sin
her soul is drowning in remorse
she flushes she shakes her head violently no
she strikes her breast
she feels that she is damned eternally eternally abandoned by god
she raises her head in bewilderment
she thinks of hell
she stands up as if to cry out in remorse
then suddenly she recalls the executioner and the stake at which her flesh will burn
she collapses again on her bed
she sits there in agony her head hidden in her hands
the door opens
the jailer comes in
now joan rises having made her decision
she hurries over to the jailer and shouts go and fetch the judges
i take back
i have lied she looks at him with tear stained eyes and gives him a push to make him go and tell the prelates
she is seized by a deadly fear she is terrified that a new fit of weakness will master her before she can put into effect the decision she has just
she knows that this decision will probably lead to her death but this she feels strong enough to meet
and now that the first step has been taken she trembles with impatience
she is weary of the struggle and longs to be free
the spectators of the scene in the churchyard have still not returned to the town but have encamped in a large open space where booths selling cider and other drinks
have been set up
they are grouped in families on the grass some of them are crowding round the booths and the younger ones are dancing and singing to the sound of music
the preceding prison scenes alternate with short shots of this folklife dancing bears acrobats jugglers a musician a hobby horse a dance leader a man with a stick over his
shoulder and a cask hanging from the stick penny in the bucket another musician who has fastened together a drum and a flute which he holds in the left hand with the drum stick in his right
a wild dance a man selling birds dwarfs contortionists
the following prison scene is interrupted by glimpses of the preparations round the bonfire which is to be lit in the castle yard a man carrying firewood to the stake
a broken carriage wheel in the fuel etc
the jailer now finds cauchon in conversation with warwick at the entrance to the chapel
the jailer explains briefly what has happened in the prison
warwick and cauchon exchange eloquent glances
at the same moment loiseleur comes out from the chapel
in a few words cauchon puts him in the picture and tells him to assemble some of the judges and notaries
meanwhile joan sits waiting impatiently in her prison
it is evident that she does not make a sacrifice such as hers without doing her nature an injury
she is racked by deep despair and her nerves show it
she shivers her teeth chatter
she wrings her hands so that her knuckles are completely white
finally cauchon enters followed by various judges and notaries
they find the young girl dissolved in tears her face contorted
it is a poor helpless girl of twenty whom they have defeated
during the following scene cauchon exudes an air of benevolence and satisfaction
in contrast with his earlier demeanor he is now calm and equable
his feelings are pleasurable but it is not a malicious pleasure he is sure of his prey
they sit down and cauchon asks joan why she has sent for them
with a sob but also with an expression of determination she answers i have committed a great sin
she has to break off choked by tears
the judges comfort her and try to alleviate her grief so that she can continue i have denied god in order to save my life
the judges look at one another
not one of them is so hard hearted as to be untouched by the young womans genuine distress
even cauchon is moved
it is a moment before he speaks
then he says so you still believe that you are sent by god
joan nods in confirmation
again the judges exchange looks
the notary raises his head from his book
he examines the judges faces searchingly looks at joan and writes in his notes fatal answer
cauchon has stood up
however dulled his human feelings may be it still goes against the grain with him to send joan to the stake even though she herself is asking to die
he says in a friendly tone but joan you have admitted in front of everybody that you were misled by the devil
joan who has gradually regained her self control does not answer immediately
it is only when the judges press her that she replies everything i said was for fear of the stake
cauchon holds a whispered consultation with the others but it is clear that they all regard it as wasted effort to continue
cauchon says have you anything else to tell us
joan shakes her head
the judges rise to go
when cauchon goes into the adjoining room his eye falls on warwick who has just come up the stairs and now gives cauchon a look of enquiry
cauchon merely says it is all over
warwick receives the news with no indication of surprise
meanwhile the judges have started to go down the stairs when cauchon holds the last two back
they are ladvenu and massieu
cauchon drops his voice and gives them an order
the two monks go into the cell where they find joan sitting with her hands in her lap
she is now calm and decided
what is she thinking about
about her home in domremy or about death
massieu and ladvenu remain standing by the door
joan does not see them so preoccupied is she with her own thoughts
they approach with cautious steps as people do involuntarily in the house of death
ladvenu calls to her
she looks up surprised to see him
then ladvenu says joan i have come to prepare you for death
for a moment silence reigns so deep that joans breathing can be heard
then she says in a barely audible voice now
ladvenu struggling with the tears which are muffling his voice answers yes
another long long silence
then joan asks almost as if fearing the answer what kind of death
ladvenu choked by his feelings is unable to speak
he makes a sign for massieu to answer on his behalf
massieu says at the stake
a slight shudder passes over joans face but in her soul there is no longer any struggle or doubt
ladvenu who has now regained his self control gives massieu a quiet order
massieu goes out hurriedly
when he has gone ladvenu says how can you still believe that you are sent by god
joan smiles as if she knows more than other men and answers his ways are not our ways
after a pause she adds yes i am his child
ladvenu moved by this persistent faith says presently and the great victory
joan looks at him as if amazed at his asking such a stupid question
she answers my martyrdom
he looks at her as at a saint descended from heaven
yet he cannot refrain from asking one more question and your release
joan answers with a look of ecstasy in her eyes death
her purity and the sincerity of her faith in god are almost dazzling to ladvenu
he gets up
he pities the unhappy joan and is troubled over this soul which is endangered beyond hope of salvation
he turns to joan and asks her if she wants to confess
she accepts his offer gratefully and kneels
massieu has gone to fetch the eucharist
a procession of priests wearing surplices and stoles and carrying lights in their hands comes out of the chapel and goes in the direction of the castle yard singing litanies
everyone in the castle yard kneels the women are in tears
to every entreaty the priests answer pray for her
presently the procession arrives at joans cell and she prepares to receive the eucharist
ladvenu takes the consecrated host in his hands shows it to joan and says do you believe that this is the body of christ
joan receives the body of christ with touching meekness
she weeps copiously as once again she finds him from whom she has so long been kept apart
in the fullness of her heart she raises her voice and offers to jesus prayers of a childlike gentleness and moving quality
the cell door stands open
in the ante room loiseleur has come into view
he hears joan talking with her savior and is deeply moved
even this mans eyes well over with tears
he is afraid he will be unable to stifle his emotion and withdraws
the solemn ceremony is over
the monks leave
the jailer comes in with a coat which joan is to wear
meanwhile rumors are circulating among the crowd in the area behind the churchyard that joan has withdrawn her abjuration
now they set out in swarms for the castle pressing over the lowered drawbridge leading into the castle yard where the english soldiers control the flow in such a way
that they keep the invaders concentrated in one corner of the yard
through the gate hundreds of curious sightseers can be seen climbing up into trees and standing on the parapets of the bridge in the hope of seeing a tiny fragment
of the unaccustomed spectacle
in between scenes from the prison are shown
joan is wearing a coat that comes down to her feet which are bare
her earlier calm seems to have disappeared
she prays and weeps incessantly
ladvenu and massieu who have returned to fetch her lead her away
joan has arrived at the castle yard
in her coat she appears to many of those present as a vision from god
an old woman approaches hands joan a cup of milk weeps and kneels
the poor child who is herself in need of comfort offers the woman such comfort as she can but the english soldiers put an end to this scene
the stake is erected in the middle of the castle yard
the fuel is piled up on a foundation of stone
the post to which the victim is to be tied projects over the fuel
the intention is for thousands of people to witness with their own eyes that the maid has really been burnt
a notice board is fastened to the stake with the following inscription heretic relapsed apostate idolatress
further away there is a platform for the judges and the english nobility another is reserved for the preacher and for spectators
when joan has taken her place at the stake one of the judges nicolas midi stands and begins his sermon in the name of the lord amen
for joan it is as if his voice has reached her from far away
she weeps incessantly as she watches the executioners final preparations she sees him bending over his coal bucket later she sees him with a knife in his mouth uncoiling the
rope which is to fasten her to the stake
nicolas midi continues his sermon like a rotten member we cut you off from the body of the church
the preacher turns to face joan directly she listens attentively and gives an unconscious nod
at the same moment she sees a flock of doves taking off and flying into the heavens
then nicolas midi ends his short address joan go forth in peace
the church is unable to protect you
joan who retains to the end her respect for the churchs servants inclines politely and gratefully in his direction
in a loud voice she prays dear god i accept my death willingly and gladly
her face becomes more serious and more anguished she continues but i entreat thee if thou lovest me that my suffering may be short
her lament mild but strongly spoken rings through the hushed square
everyone holds his breath to hear the condemned joans last words every eye turns towards her and watches for her smallest movement
they are deeply affected by the simplicity she shows face to face with death
many are in tears even some of the english soldiers
at the end of her prayer she says to ladvenu with tears in her eyes where will i be tonight
ladvenu exhorts her to have faith in god with the help of the almighty she will attain her place in paradise
the english soldiers grow impatient and one of their officers approaches the platform and says look here priest are you going to be all day
ladvenu insists on his right to prepare the young woman for death
and he says to massieu who is bringing him a small missal joan wishes to have a cross with her when she dies
ladvenu instructs massieu to fetch one from the chapel and with the little missal in his hand he reads the prayers for those under sentence of death
one of the english soldiers has heard ladvenus words to massieu
he extracts two bits of wood from a faggot lying ready for the bonfire and joins them so that they form a modest little cross
joan who has followed his movements is touched
she takes the cross lovingly and reverently and covers it with kisses
the english captain is now losing patience and orders the executioner to do his duty
massieu returns with the processional cross
he shows it to joan she is inexpressibly happy as she takes it with both hands kisses it with tears in her eyes and addresses ardent prayers to it
now her eye falls on the executioner who has climbed up on the other side of her in order to tie her to the stake
he drops the rope she picks it up
she is bound brutally to the stake
ladvenu remains standing
during joans prayer he remains holding the crucifix in front of her so that throughout she can see her savior
when the executioner has secured joan he descends
ladvenu continues to speak words of comfort to joan
all around her are now in tears
even cauchon weeps
the executioner has made his final preparations
in his hand he holds the flaming torch which is to set the bonfire alight
joan suddenly catches sight of the fire but her first thought is not for herself she thinks only of ladvenu who seems to have forgotten the danger he is exposed
she shouts to him the fire
but she implores him urgently to continue right up to the end holding the cross raised before her eyes
the flames crackle and climb higher
suddenly a deathly hush descends on the square
a dull silence
only the crackle of the flames and the mumbled prayers of the priests can be heard
oppressed by this stillness some of the spectators fall on their knees and others follow their example
many of them light wax candles
the flames leap from one faggot to another
they advance in little jumps over cavities and gaps in the fuel
sparks fly smoke whirls up through the smoke which occasionally conceals joan can be seen part of her face which is raised to heaven and her mouth which is whispering
then her eyes seek christ whom ladvenu continues to hold up towards her christ who like herself is enveloped in smoke
through the smoke she sees the executioner stirring the fire and a soldier on his knees trying to get near enough to the bonfire to throw the martyrs crown on
she also sees massieu who is sprinkling holy water on the bonfire from his stoup
meanwhile the judges have risen
the clerics are not allowed to witness the actual execution but their departure is in the nature of a flight
the eyes of most of them are filled with tears
they all cross themselves as they withdraw
the english soldiers force a way for them through the crowd but as the priests approach the spectators the latter draw back of their own accord to avoid contact with
on every face you can read contempt in every quarter you can hear the traitors being taunted as such
suddenly the first tongues of flame lick round joans feet
the things of this earth are vanishing and joans thoughts are now only of the king of heaven
in spite of the pain and terror she does not forget her christ indeed it is as if with every second that passes she is coming steadily closer to him
she begins to scream in her long death struggle
the weeping crowds repeat the name of jesus
innumerable tongues of flame growing constantly in size number and fierceness are now fanning round her
the rope binding her to the stake begins to burn
joan is frantic with terror jesus
she screams in her agony
the echo repeats her cry in the sad and silent square
the bystanders pray in chorus while the women weep and wail intercede for us
others continue now and in our last hour
joans coat is already in flames consumed by the fire as far as the knees
her feet are burning
but the executioner continues piling fuel on the bonfire
an ominous infernal silence prevails
joan screams jesus
but the bystanders who during these final scenes stand as if paralyzed by the fire and by joans cries are seized by a mood compounded of fear and ecstasy
outbursts of anger and indignation against the oppressors can already be heard
the english soldiers take up a threatening posture
the flames climb steadily higher
the notice board fastened over joans head goes up in flames and falls into the bonfire
a last vision is caught of joans face contorted in terror
she pronounces once more the name of jesus lets her head slump and gives up the ghost
the tumult grows among the bystanders clenched fists are raised in the air
threatening words can be heard
then somebody in the crowd gives free expression to what everybody is thinking and shouts you have burnt a saint
the cry is taken up until it is heard from every throat
the rope fastening joan to the stake has burnt through and falls in ashes
joans body totters and sinks into the bonfire
at a sign from warwick the soldiers pursue the mob out of the castle yard with thrusts of their lances through the gate and over the drawbridge which is then
many fall victim to the soldiers brutality or are trampled to death
the smoke rises in a column concealing joan
on warwicks orders the executioner rakes through the fire
normally no trace of joan should remain but what is this
joans heart is undamaged
he shows it to warwick and pours oil on the flames but still the heart will not catch fire
he tries in vain with the help of sulphur and coal to make it burn the flame leaps up guided by his expert hand but when the fire subsides again
the executioner finds the heart still intact
convinced that he is witnessing a manifest miracle he looks questioningly at warwick who answers curtly throw this lot in the seine
in his anguish the executioner falls on his knees before ladvenu terrified that he will be condemned for having burnt a saint
as the sun went down joans heart was sunk in the river the heart which from that time became the heart of france just as she herself was the incarnation
of the eternal france
