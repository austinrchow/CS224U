falling from the top of frame to the bottom
pluming off into dust
white white white
we move toward it even as it recedes always out of reach
finally we pop out wide and high to reveal
the white is chalk
an old black groundskeeper lays down the right field line on a baseball diamond
dust motes in the air
a large goldfish tank bubbles
branch rickey at his desk
two photos on the wall abe lincoln leo durocher
chalkboards covered with s of names every player in the dodger organization
clyde sukeforth and harold parrott sit across from rickey who stares at them
sukeforth stares back
gentlemen i have a plan
as of now only the board of directors and my family know
sukeforth and parrott exchange a look
a plans always good mr
and you always got one
my wife says im too old that my health isnt up to it
my son says that every one in baseball will be against me
but im going to do it
parrott looks to sukeforth who keeps his eyes on rickey
do what mr
im going to bring a negro ballplayer to the brooklyn dodgers
with all due respect sir have you lost your mind
imagine the abuse youll take from the newspapers alone
never mind how itll play on flatbush
rickey looks dismissively at parrott over to sukeforth
theres no law against it clyde
theres a code
break a law and get away with it some people think youre smart
break an unwritten law though youll be an outcast
so be it
new york is full of negro baseball fans every dollar is green
i dont know who he is or where he is but hes coming
the big birmingham black barons catcher behind the plate as kansas city monarchs john scott stands at bat
the catchers attention on the runner dancing off first
stomping a foot feinting hard to see clearly in the glare of the lights
whered you learn to move like that runner
at dime a dance night
insert birmingham alabama
on the first pitch the runner takes off
the catcher fires to second
see it from his pov as the runner slides in asafe
a a foot on the bag the runner dusts off heckles the catcher is that the best you got
im going to steal nine ten bases today
you better start counting
the catcher frowns
standing we see he is a big big man
wheres your shortstop from
hes got a mouth on him
shaking his head the catcher gets back in his crouch signals the pitcher
on the wind up the runner is off again
the catcher fires to third asafe
a you got a rag arm catcher
youll find out what kind of arm i got
okay im coming
the catcher looks over at scott who chuckles
well california here he goes if he comes down here
the catcher gets back down in his squat
signals the pitcher fastball
scott digs in ready
the runner dancing off third
here comes the wind up
the runner takes off even as the pitcher fires it in
the birmingham catcher receives it
as the runner slides the catcher intentionally drives his glove the ball and both hands into the runners face whallop
sound drops as were knocked flat senseless along with the runner
on him now as he tries to push himself up from the dirt
a close look at jack roosevelt robinson
a born battler he shakes out the cobwebs finally lurches to his feet looks to the umpire
he never heard the call
what was i
the umpire passes one hand over the other safe
jack looks over at the catcher gives him a pointed look as he goes the catcher shoves him in the back
jack turns shoves back
as the two men wrestles each other to the ground rickey and sukeforth going through stacks of files on the desk
a black ballplayers picture is clipped to each
as rickey reviews one sukeforth tries to hand him another
oh boy can he hit
rickey wont take the file the answer is no
sukeforth holds it out rickey wont take it
a heck of a player
but too sweet theyll eat him alive
holds up file satchel paige then
parrott enters carrying an armful of files
we need a man with a future not a past
holds up his own here
jack roosevelt robinson
as parrott sets them on the desk they start to slide off spilling to the floor
helpless to stem the tide parrott looks down surrounded by black faces
flips through file a four sport college man out of ucla
that means hes played with white boys
twenty six years old now with the kansas city monarchs
batting over even as we speak
and he was a commissioned army officer
he was court martialed
a trouble maker
he argues with umpires
a quick temper is his reputation
rickey is obviously keen on him
what was he court martialed for
for refusing to sit in the back of a military bus
checks the file ft
the driver asked him to move back
the mps had to take him off
do you see
i see he resents segregation
if he were white wed call it spirit
if he were white sir we wouldnt be looking for him
rickey ends the debate
robinsons a methodist
im a methodist
gods a methodist
we cant go wrong
bring him here
a bloodhound watches as a bus pulls into a service station the tires ring the bell hose
a million miles easy on this road rumbler
the banner reads kc monarchs
insert interstate missouri august
the driver steps off
the fellas follow getting off to stretch their legs
hot and tired
a white attendant saunters out
the driver steps over to meet him
fill her up
the attendant starts unscrewing caps on two gallon tanks
where you all headed
as the attendant shoves down a pump starts filling jack steps off
he spots and heads for a restroom
white men only lettered on the door
the attendant roused as he sees
where you going boy
everyone looking over as jack stops
im going to the toilet
shit boy cmon
you know you cant go in there
jack does a slow burn then suddenly strides toward the attendant
the air rife with tension
take that hose out of the tank
take it out
well get our ninety nine gallons of gas someplace else
the attendant blinks
he takes a look from jack to up and down the deserted highway
no business in sight
okay use it
but dont stay in there too long
jack heads back
the driver the players a bit stunned
jack splashes water on his face rips a paper towels from the dispenser pats his face dry
he balls the wad up squeezes it in his fist before firing it into the trash
he considers his reflection in the mirror
as he regards himself we hear the service bell ring outside
a car has pulled up
the driver talks to several players
they look over as jack exits
the driver is clyde sukeforth
are you jackie robinson
jack sits across the desk from rickey
sukeforth sits a little further back
rickey is staring at jack
bushy eyebrows flared light gleams off his glasses
jack doesnt know what to do looks to sukeforth
do you have a girl
a man needs a family relying on him
it insures hell behave responsibly
do you have a girl
i think so
you think so
jack looks to sukeforth who smiles placidly
back to rickey
i dont make much money
between the army and now baseball ive been away a lot
and rae rachel she wants to finish school
considering all that i say i think so
do you love her
dont you know
yes sir very much
rickey stands walks to a window
jack looks at sukeforth who raises a hand as if to say give it a chance
baseballs a hard life a man needs a good woman by his side
you dont want the only person waiting for you at home to be a catcher
sukeforth chuckles at that
rickey fingers open a slat on the blind and peers out
jack looks hard at him
coach sukeforth here said you were starting a new negro league
that doesnt make sense to me
it doesnt huh
are you calling us liars jack
whats this about mr
this is about baseball
rickey opens the shade
sunlight floods in
rickey follows it to the chalkboard to the list of players under montreal
i see you starting in the spring with our affiliate in montreal
if you make it there well try you down here with the dodgers
the white brooklyn dodgers
jack looks to sukeforth who nods yes you heard right
ill pay you a month and a bonus when you sign the contract
is that agreeable
believe it or not thats a lot of money to jack on this day in time
this is all becoming a bit overwhelming
there is one condition
i have a pile of scouting reports
i know you can hit behind the runner that you can read a pitch
the question is can you control your temper
yes your temper
are you deaf
rickey furious the avuncular old man gone
jack sits there fists now balled
rickey to sukeforth like hes not there he looks proud
hell need to be
rickey looks back to jack who is as angry as he is confused
i want to win
i want ballplayers who can win
are you one of them
a black man in white baseball
imagine the reaction
rickey strides forward gets in his face
the dodgers check into a hotel
a decent good hotel
youre worn out from the road and some clerk wont give you the pen to sign in
we got no room boy not even down in the coal bin where you belong
jack looks like he wants to tear rickey apart
the team stops at a restaurant
the waiter wont take your order
adopts a new voice didnt you see the sign on the door
no animals allowed
what are you going to do then
ruin all my plans
answer me you black sonofabitch
do you want a ballplayer who doesnt have the guts to fight back
is that what you want
i want one who has the guts not to fight back
there are people who will not like this
they will do anything to get you to react
if you echo a curse with a curse they will only hear yours
follow a blow with a blow and they will say a negro lost his temper that the negro does not belong
your enemy will be out in force but you can not meet him on his own low ground
we win with hitting running and fielding nothing else
we win if the world is convinced of two things that you are a fine gentlemen and a great ballplayer
like our savior you must have the guts to turn the other cheek
jack considers rickey
rickey looks worn out
can you do it
jack poised at what will be his rubicon
rickey you give me a uniform you give me a number on my back and ill give you the guts
a phone rings on a table
rachel isum steps in possessed of style that you can only be graced with
jack in a phone booth the lobby busy beyond
rae im in brooklyn
i dont want to say on the phone
in fact im not supposed to tell anyone
she can hear the tingle in his voice
im here rae whats going on
youre supposed to be playing in chicago
weve been tested you and me
our loyalty our faith
weve done everything the right way
me trying to make money
you finishing school
separated by the war now by baseball
we dont owe the world a thing
only each other
shes actually getting a little scared now
jack what are you talking about
the brooklyn dodgers just signed me to play ball up in montreal
it might lead to bigger things
to something wonderful
what does it mean
for you and me
will you marry me
jack i dont think we can get married in a phone booth
jack rounds a corner in a tuxedo the bow tie undone
rachel follows in her wedding gown
they look beautiful
did my mom look happy
they reach the door
jack gets out a key to unlock it
rachel looks nervous steps back across the hall
did my gram look happy
swinging the door open he looks at her
the air charged
everyone looked happy
ive never seen so many people looking happy
did jack robinson look happy
what if i cant make you happy
he steps over aware of her shyness
you already do
its you and me rae
until the wheels fall off
the world is waiting for us
it can wait one more night are you coming mrs
kisses him back id follow you anywhere mr
he picks her up carries her over the threshold
as the door clicks shut behind them
the shades closed were scheming again
wendell smith sits across from rickey who stares back intently
bespectacled smith covers baseball for the pittsburgh courier
whos the best shortstop you ever saw
and you call yourself a sports writer
yes a sentimental one
im from detroit
he was the tiger shortstop when i was a boy
how about you
whos your best
not honus wagner
wagner is number two
and rabbit tavener would not break my top
where do you suppose jackie robinson will end up on that list
he wont break it
he doesnt have a shortstops arm
robinson belongs on second base
alright then where would he rate at second
if he was playing now hed be the best second baseman in the majors
hell have to be the best in the minor leagues first
what are you saying mr
im saying its going to be a very interesting spring training
a lot of players are coming back from the war and with gas rationing over we can train down in florida again
youre aware in the past six months a black boy was lynched in madison florida and a black man down in live oaks
those towns may as well be a million miles from daytona
live oaks is actually
i spoke to the daytona mayor
he assures me therell be no trouble
but rickey doesnt sound so sure
they consider each other
smith are you a communist
im a democrat
why do you ask
i have a business proposition
whats your salary at the courier
fifty dollars a week
i will pay you an additional fifty dollars a week plus expenses if you will attend spring training with jackie robinson
you will watch over him help him to avoid the harm that could come if he were to do or say anything out of turn
you will act as his chauffeur you will secure accommodations for him wherever the team may be help him find restaurants etc
whats in it for me
besides the fifty dollars and a whole lot of aggravation
unprecedented access for any reportage you feel appropriate
what do you say mr
i say yes sir
if a negro is good enough to stop a nazi bullet in france hes good enough to stop a line drive at yankee stadium

rachel gives jack a subtle but emphatic look no
jack escorts rachel to the plane the shoebox in hand
i couldnt tell her no
i know she means well i just dont want to be seen eating chicken out of a box like some country bumpkin

we have our problems in pasadena but not like this

the buick stops at a nice looking house
joe and duff harris live here
he gets out the black vote does a lot of good for colored folks
rickey set it up himself
if we cant put the robinsons in the hotels they should stay some place that represents something

youll stay with the harrises except for a few days at the end of the week

harris opens it
i call this the love nest
i hope you like it
as jack enters mrs
harris starts back down

rachel enters closes the door behind her and accidentally knocks jack onto the bed
she lands on top of him
the room is impossibly small
it barely holds their luggage and the bed theyre on
as they look around its a joke right
i like it

she kisses him
hes starting to like it too
remind me dinners at five
ill try to remember
as the kisses become more urgent
smith pulls up alongside the team buses looks across at jack who is just a little nervous
the first day of spring training
my pittsburgh courier readers need to know how it feels
thats not exactly a headline
thats all i got
look jack right now its just me asking you
but you get on that field and its going to be the new york times and the sporting news
you should think about it
if they ask something ill answer
alright but you know when youre at the plate you want to feel like you see the pitch come in slow
well you want to see the questions come in slow too
jack just looks at him
as players brooklyn st
paul montreal warm up practice rickey sits on the bench angry as he reads a newspaper
harold parrott hurries over something urgent on his mind
rickey on a rant parrott cant get a word in
listen to this harold
whenever i hear a white man yours truly broadcasting what a moses he is to the negro race then i know the latter needs a bodyguard
parrott tries to it is those of the carpetbagger stripe of the white race me again who under the guise of helping in truth are using the negro for their
own selfish interest thereby retarding the race
parrott tries to interrupt again but rickey is furious
the minor league commissioner of baseball said that
i pay part of his salary
you wouldnt stab me in the back like this would you
hes here mr
why didnt you say so
jack crossing toward them in his montreal monarchs uniform carrying a glove and a bat
white players clocking him
hes surrounded by reporters and photographers
its the cue for most of the batting and fielding and chatter among the dodgers royals and saints to come to a stop
higbe forgets bragan is throwing him a ball
it clocks him in the chest
reese and stanky passing a medicine ball
thats him huh
take a wild guess
flash bulbs go off in jacks face
questions like punches
shouts of a jackie and then
jackie do you think you can make it with these white boys
jack looks off to where smith watches back to the reporter
see the questions slow
he answers with measure
sure i had no problem with white men in the service or at ucla
whatll you do if one of these pitchers throws at your head
thinks a beat ill duck
that gets some laughs
jack whats your natural position
ive been playing shortstop
are you after pee wee reeses job
jack looks over to where reese watches with stanky
reese plays for brooklyn
im worried about making montreal
is this about politics
its about getting paid
jack doing beautifully
smith breathes a sigh of relief
in a montreal uniform hoppers too old to be a ballplayer
he stands with dixie walker the dodger right fielder
well when mr
rickey picks one he sure picks a black one
hes fine with me so long as you keep him up in montreal
here comes the old man to save him
they watch as rickey pulls jack from the press
he leads jack directly toward hopper
as walker excuses himself
good luck hop
clay id like you to meet jackie robinson
jackie clay hopper manager of the montreal royals
hopper shakes his hand as they exchange greetings
we aint doing much today
just throwing the ball around and hitting a few
why dont you toss a few with those fellas over there
a kid in a montreal uniform looks over
meet jackie robinson
the end of the day
buses leave by team the dodgers and the farm clubs
white faces look down as they pass a tired jack who walks through the lot toward wendell smith and his buick
higbe and bragan call out from the door of the dodger bus
did you hear about the redneck shortstop
he thought the last two words of the national anthem were play ball
jack forces a smile but the joke comes off a bit harsh
and they seem like theyre laughing at him as
how about the shortstop making all the errors tried to kill himself by jumping out on the highway
a bus just missed him
drove right between his legs
as the bus passes by jack sees the impassive faces of dixie walker reiser stanky pee wee reese and finally year old branca
branca smiles offers an awkward little wave
between his legs good one
he mustve read a joke book
if he can read
jack just gets in the car
smith sighs drum rolls the hood of the buick
hi wendell how are you
well looks like i got a long drive to sanford
brock comes out the screen door carrying a tray of tall drinks
he sets them on a table watches and waits as smith and jack get out of the buick start up the steps
jackie im ray brock
welcome to sanford florida
the day belongs to decent minded people
they shake hands
brock looks to smith obviously knows him
wendell good to see you
my wifes inside cooking
you know what she asked me this morning
she asked me what do you serve when a heros coming for dinner
jacks humble embarrassed doesnt know what to say
im just a ballplayer mr
tell that to all the little colored boys playing baseball in florida today
youre a hero to them
the look on jacks face says thats a heavy burden
sit down have something to drink
my special rum and coke
no thank you sir i dont drink
a ballplayer who doesnt drink
thats a new one on me
ill have one
im a stereotypical reporter through and through
brock do you have a desk
id like to get a letter to my wife
of course this way
brock leads jack ahead smith sips his drink
rickey and montreal manager hopper stand by the dugout watching a spring game versus st paul
jacks playing second
they watch him closely as they talk
hes getting by on a quick release but his arms too weak for short
second base is his spot
and ill state another obvious clay i need the players to act like gentlemen around him
the man on first takes a lead
to treat him as they would any other teammate
to be natural to impose no restrictions on themselves
to all work together in harmony
the hit run is on
the man on first runs on the pitch as a low line drive shoots for the gap between st and nd
robinson turns himself inside out to dive on his belly and catch it before it hits the ground
he spins himself around pivots on a knee to throw the runner out before he can get back to first
a rickey is astounded
that was superhuman
dont get carried away mr
rickey thats still a nigger out there
rickey takes a moment to process
its hoppers light admonishing tone that really halts him
clay i realize that attitude is part of your heritage that you practically nursed race prejudice at your mothers breast so i will let it pass
but i will add this you can manage robinson fairly and correctly or you can be unemployed
they both look over as jack comes off the field toward them
way to turn two
smith and mr
brock are sitting on the porch sipping rum and cokes
a quiet evening
i hope jackie sleeps alright
chasing baseballs in the sun all day id be in my grave
how are they treating him out there
they watch as a car slows parks across the street
okay as far as i can see
a middle aged white man luther exits the car and starts toward them
you find good people every place you go
even here in florida
is he in there
who is it youre looking for
nigra ball player
the air suddenly alive with danger
maybe you better come back in the morning
i aint comin back
other fellas is comin
they aint too happy about him stayin here in sanford
playin ball with white boys
a long beat skedaddle thats what id do
ifn they get here and hes still here theres gonna be trouble
he turns and walks away
as they watch a phone rings
yes wendell what is it
rickey in his pajamas in his hotel room
on the phone
yes i understand
wake him up and get him out of there
put him in the car and start driving for daytona beach
and wendell under no circumstance tell him what this is about
i do not want him to get it in his head to stay there and fight
half dressed jack sits on the edge of his bed feeling bad
through his open door across a hall we can see smith in his room
passing in and out of view packing his own things
i was just getting loose
smith sticks his head in the door
dont just sit there
pack your duds
a phone rings somewhere
they hear brock answer then wendell
smith leaves the room
hold on jack despair as he listens
rickey im with him now
were pulling out for daytona in five minutes soon as he gets his bag packed
yes yes its just one of those things
a one of those things
as jacks head hangs a little lower
the street deserted sidewalks rolled up
jack angry and silent in the passenger seat
smith jumpy behind the wheel
they stop as a pick up stops ahead outside a bar where a dozen white men in shirtsleeves exchange words with the boys in the truck
to jack it looks like a typical small town bull session
to smith it looks like something else
the white men look over at the two black men
one steps over motions roll down the window
i wonder what he wants
to run us out of town
what are you talking about

as jack cranks down the window smith floors it

what the hell wendell
man came by while you were asleep
told us more men were coming
maybe those boys
rickey said to get you to daytona beach a s a p
why didnt you say so
rickey was afraid you wouldnt leave that you would fight
as it becomes clear jack starts to laugh
what the hell are you laughing at
i thought you woke me because i was cut from the team
jack laughs harder
wendell laughs as well
as it fades jack looks back over his shoulder
a stadium sign boasts brooklyn dodgers vs
daytona beachs black community is turning out to see jackie robinson
hundreds of people line up mass at the colored entrance
in their sunday best

year old ed charles turns waves his baseball glove over his head so she can see him
then to no one in particular im thirteen years old
white people enter at several gates around them
he sits watching as the segregated bleachers in right fill with black fans
all else is white
rickey pops a peanut in his mouth confides to someone alongside him we dont see
ive spoken to the mayor
ive explained how much money well spend in daytona
but still when this fine young negro man steps on that field today he and the dodgers will technically be breaking the law
a law which says white and black players cannot enjoy the same field at the same time
does that make sense to you
does jim crow make any sense when placed against the words of the united states constitution
when placed against the word of god
pop out to reveal he sits beside the dodger batboy so short his feet dont touch the ground
rickey offers his peanut bag
as the batboy takes one
ill tell you it does not make sense to me

watches as the montreal batter hits a line drive which pee wee reese nearly leaps out of his socks to bring down
as the crowd claps in appreciation jack takes a deep breath

i better get one in a hurry
higbe watching from the mound as jack steps into the batters box
two well wishing voices from the infield stands
come on black boy you can make the grade
theyre giving you a chance
do something about it
jack heartened at the words
concentrates as higbes first pitch is fired
high and tight jack jerks out of the way
bragan behind the plate chucks the ball back grins up at jack who does not look down at him as he settles back in
the year old holding his hands together in prayer
please god let jackie show them what we can do
here comes the next pitch
jack nearly hit

jack takes a practice swing waits as bragan sets up right over the plate
here comes the pitch
a a big over reacting cheer from the colored section
its just a walk
who can blame them
looks ill tempered over to first where jack gives the same look back as he sidesteps an enormous defiant lead off the bag
did he just do that
well throw over there for crying out loud
higbe fires to lavagetto at first
jack dives back in time
higbe gets the ball back settles
jack takes a lead but a modest one this time
here come the pitch and jack goes
you knew he was fast but not this fast
bragans throw to pee wee is late and high
pee wee throws back to higbe
bragan gives him a sign
jack takes a lead
on the wind up jack goes
bragan stands its a pitch out
bragan fires to third and jack is caught in a run down
it seems like half the team gets involved with higbe finally getting the ball by third and jack ducking under the tag
a buzz goes through the stadium now as people start to realize they are not watching something or someone ordinary
watching from a seat behind third
higbe looks home for the sign jack dancing off third pounding his right foot toward home
he feints hard home
higbe steps off the rubber
jack stays where he is
youre supposed to go back to third when i step off
dont you know nothing
he throws over
jack back to the bag
higbe gets the ball back looks in
jack bouncing pounding off third
his movements carry violence within them
like a piston exploding in an engine
higbe into his motion stops his delivery accidentally drops the ball to the ground
the umpire signals balk points jack home
higbe is furious
his mother joins in happy despite
i dont understand
its a balk mama
the pitcher cant start toward home and then stop
but he didnt do anything
oh mama yes he did he discombobulated the man
durocher looks to branca impressed
he didnt come to play he came to kill
durocher starts out to the mound to talk to higbe
watching from right field the black crowd still cheering
he walks over toward the open bullpen where casey stands
this really how its gonna be some day
the stands are half filled

were with him at hip level as he tears down the basepath
the catcher bracing for the throw they collide hes safe
as jack gets to his feet however a jim crow policeman steps up to meet him grabs him by the shoulder
git offa this field now
its against the law is why
no niggers dont play with no white boys
git off or go to jail
jack shrugs the policemans hand off his shoulder
that sends him reaching for his nightstick and sukeforth is there to get between them
you swing that thing you better hit me between the eyes with it
is that so
the crowd booing
the black section especially
arrives from dugout hey hold on whatd he do wrong
we aint havin nigras mix with white boys in this town

rickey leans against his car watching a groundskeeper push mow the infield grass
jack in street clothes joins him
you wanted to see me mr
rickey nods consider the field a moment
bermuda grass grows so well here
i wish we could get it to grow like this in brooklyn
i like the way it smells when they mow it
rickey consider the field a moment then jack
jackie its my pleasure to tell you that youve earned a spot on the montreal royals
when they head north tuesday for opening day against jersey city youll be on the train
jack trying to hold down his excitement
i wont let you down
i know that
if you dont mind ive got to go tell my wife
give her my regards
jack about to head off when he looks back
why are you doing this mr
im an opportunist
with you and the negro players i hope to bring up next year ill put together a team that can win the world series
and the world series means money
jack studies him a beat not quite buying it
dont you believe that
i dont think what i believe is important
only what i do
therefore run the bases like the devil himself
worry those pitchers so they come apart
sometimes theyll catch you but dont worry about that
ty cobb got caught plenty
just run as you see fit
put the natural fear of god into them
ed charles and his two friends follow jack and the montreal players as they walk toward the train waiting on the tracks
jack is one of the last to board
hes almost through the door when something stops him
he looks back at ed
ed slowly raises his hand and waves
jack smiles does the same then disappears inside
the whistle blows and the train starts out of the station
on impulse ed starts to trot out after it
his friends follow
the train picks up speed
the boys start to run
arms pumping feet flying
one boy drops off
then the other
but ed still runs
chasing after that train carrying jackie robinson
finally he stops heaving for breath watching the train disappear around the bend
a lonely beat
then ed gets down on his hands and knees
he sets his ear on the rail closes his eyes
a thrum comes off the rail
a huge smile spreads
he straightens shouts back to his friends from somewhere as the national anthem ends

speaking of the pitch here it comes
jack tops a weak grounder to short
as hes thrown out by a mile
sitting up off third
his knees knocked together to hold his typewriter on his lap
nothing to write about there
he looks over at rachel who puts her hand over her mouth
i think i might be sick
excuse me wendell
he watches as she starts out looks to the field
id be sick at a swing like that too
rachel exits looking stricken
she steps over splashes a little water from the sink up into her face
an older black woman watches sympathetically
are you alright honey
i dont know why
the older woman rolls off a piece of paper towel for her
when did you have your monthly last

it may be that youre pregnant
the older woman offers a little smile leaves her there

jack steps up to bat
the jersey city giant pitcher looks to the montreal runner at first glances over his shoulder at the montreal runner at second then focuses on home
his hands resting on the top of his typewriter
come on jackie
come on batter
emerging up the runway
the field opening up before her
theres jack standing down there
the sight of him settles her
as she puts a hand gently over her belly
grimaces for something extra as he fires a high fastball jack unloads
all heads turn to watch it sail high into the left field bleachers banging hard off the scoreboard
nearly drops his typewriter pushes his hat back as he watches jack start his home run trot
hopper cant believe his eyes
softly to himself ill be damned
as he runs the base paths
over it a typewriter clatters
robinson jogged around the bases his heart singing
the crowd loves it as he continues toward third where sukeforth is clapping for all hes worth
and our own hearts beat just a bit faster and the thrill ran through us like champagne bubbles
watching him head for home shaking hands with the two men he batted in

as all of us know a young negro second baseman played north of the border last season
insert brooklyn ymca
in back two deacons in the back whisper over a sports page
look here what he did
led the international league in batting
in stolen bases runs scored
in the minor league world series
last season doesnt matter
the international league it doesnt matter
what matters is this year
what matters is brooklyn
here he comes
as herbert miller introduces
i present the general manager of the brooklyn dodger baseball club mr
warm applause as rickey steps up
as it settles
i have something very important to talk with you about tonight
something that will require courage from all of us
i have a ballplayer on my montreal team named jackie robinson
the start of applause
rickey motions for it to stop
he may stay there or he may be brought to brooklyn
but if jackie does come up to the dodgers the biggest threat to his success the one enemy most likely to ruin that success is the negro people themselves
there is shocked silence in the room
rickey notices a group of kids watching from a raised running track soldiers on i say it as cruelly as i can to make you all realize the weight of
responsibility that is not only on myself and the dodgers but on negroes everywhere
for on the day jackie enters the national league if he does i have no doubt every one of you will form parades and welcoming committees
youll wear badges
youll hold jackie robinson days and jackie robinson nights
youll get drunk fight and be arrested
this is too much
people are slackjawed
rickey powers on
youll wine and dine him until he is fat and futile
youll symbolize his importance into a national comedy and yes a tragedy
so let me tell you this
pounds his fist if any group or segment of negro society uses the advancement of jackie robinson in baseball as a triumph of race over race i will regret the
day i ever signed him to a contract and i will personally see that baseball is never so abused and misrepresented again
is he done
an embarrassed smattering of applause
mostly shock and stares
as rickey stands there uncomfortably
rickey stands waiting giving that speech has worn him out
the door opens and miller looks in on him
i question your bedside manner mr
rickey but theyve agreed to set up a committee of self policing
well call it the dont spoil jackies chances campaign
thank you mr
im sorry the spotlight will be on us all

im trying to sleep mr
its still dark out
its very early in new york

i need to know your attitude toward jackie robinson
i dont got an attitude toward him
the girl rolls over to look at him
she is the actress lorraine day and she is stunning
as durocher regards her
eight times in the bible were told to love our neighbor
its one of gods most repeated commands
she puts her hands on him
durocher addressing rickey
i dont know much about the bible
but i didnt go to school just to eat my lunch either
ill play an elephant if he can help us win
to make room for him ill send my own brother home if hes not as good
in his ear what are you going to do with me
were playing for money mr
winnings the only thing that matters
is he a nice guy
if by nice you mean soft no not particularly
he cant afford to be
nice guys finish last
what about nice girls
she starts to kiss him
its hard to concentrate
so you have no objections to him
can i go back to sleep now
oh and leo
the bible says a thing or two about adultery as well
im sure its got a lot to say about a lot
durocher hangs up the phone looks to her
what am i gonna do with you
leo i thought you knew
as she kisses him
jack stands out front kissing jackie jr
good bye as a cabbie muscles his luggage down the walkway to a waiting taxi
jack kisses mallie and hands off the baby
mallie carries the boy inside leaving jack and rachel alone to say goodbye
promise me youll write
when did i ever not write
i want you to know im there for you
even if its words on paper
hes sees shes raw takes her in his arms with the baby
rae youre in my heart
she sighs rests her head on his shoulder
youre getting close now
the closer you get the worse theyll be
dont let them get to you
i will not
god built me to last
he kisses her
she kisses him back
see you in brooklyn in eight weeks
it might be montreal
a certainty grips her
she passes it on to him
its going to be brooklyn
i know it is
power in her words
he nods looks off toward the taxi
ive got to go rae
they kiss embrace a last time
he starts away down the walk
something not quite right
a tug as jack stops looks back at her
fighting back her emotion and then impelled forward she runs to him
they come together
she practically disappears in his arms
they do not want to be apart
durocher eats heartily
rickeys food is untouched
its a pipe dream mr
what do you mean by pipe dream
insert panama city panama
i mean it aint gonna happen
the dodgers are never gonna demand robinson be brought up from montreal
ball players are conservative
a team full of tough war veterans
boys from impoverished parts of the country
it aint gonna happen
you really believe they wont accept him
once they see how he plays how he can help them win
im not saying they wont accept him im saying they wont ask for him
im saying robinsons good medicine but theyre not gonna like the taste
im saying bend over boys and get ready this one might hurt a little
boy this is good fish
as higbe south carolina finishes writing something on a piece of hotel stationary bragan alabama looks to dixie walker alabama and dodger pitcher hugh casey georgia
why do you think rickeys got us playing spring games in panama
he wants to get us used to negro crowds
he wants more of them than us
hes hoping itll get us more comfortable being around robinson
higbe clears his throat reads what hes written we the undersigned brooklyn dodgers will not play ball on the same field as jackie robinson
higbe signs it
he hands the pen to bragan who adds his own name
casey signs with a flourish
casey holds out the pen to walker who doesnt take it right away
an odd beat
if you wanna make your mark dixie we can witness it
everyone laughs it loosens walker up enough to sign
higbe knocks as casey bragan and walker crowd behind him
the boys enter
eddie stanky sits in a chair stripped to the waist soaking his right elbow in a bucket of ice
whats goin on
got a petition goin on stank
to keep robinson up in montreal where he belongs
did pee wee sign it
aint asked him yet
what difference does it make
none just wonderin
stanky looks to walker who looks away
re his right arm cant sign now
could i catch up with you later
standing in the door to his room
looking out at the glum faces of higbe bragan casey and walker
look its like this
i got a wife a baby and i got no money
i dont want to step in anything
skip me dix im not interested
what if they put him at shortstop
if hes man enough to take my job i suppose he deserves it
laughs out loud the hell he does
he does not have the ice water in his veins for big league baseball
so let him show what hes got
robinson can play or he cant
itll all take care of itself
the very son of immigrants rickey was talking about
from pennsylvania no less
give me the pen
higbe grins hands it over
as furillo signs
durocher lays staring up at the palm shadows on the ceiling
finally the phone rings
have our friends in the press gone to sleep yet
we are the only people awake on this entire isthmus mr
a deliberate violation of the law needs a little show of force
i leave it to you
good night leo
durocher stands in a hotel bathrobe arms crossed as his players and coaches file in
bleary eyed half dressed theyre all here all wondering what this is about
suddenly durocher grabs the handle of an industrial sized soup pot and heaves it across the room
brwang rang rang
wake up ladies
wake the hell up
a stunned beat its come to my attention that some of you fellas dont want to play with robinson
that you even got a petition drawn up that youre all gonna sign
well boys you know what you can do with your petition
come on what
ball players gotta live together shower together its not right to force him on us
besides i own a hardware store back home and i screw your hardware store dix
and if you dont like it screw you
rickeyll be happy to make other arrangements for you
durocher suddenly marches to higbe looks like hes going to belt him
as higbe gulps durocher turns to the team
i dont care if hes yellow or black or has stripes like a zebra if robinson can help us win and everything ive seen says he can then hes gonna
play on this ball club
like it lump it make your mind up to it because hes coming
and think about this when your heads hit the pillow hes only the first boys only the first
more are coming right behind him
they have talent and they wanna play
he lets that sink a moment
yes sir theyre gonna come diving and scratching
so id forget your petition and worry about the field
because unless you fellas pay a little more attention to your work they are going to run you right out of the ball park
looks them over are you ballplayers or lawyers
as he marches past them and through the doors
jack in his montreal uniform headed off the field for the dugout
sukeforth headed over wearing dodger blue
as jack turns sukeforth tosses him a first basemans glove
what do you want me to do with this
play first base
ive never played first base in my life coach
well its like this
brooklyns got a solid second baseman
and they got pee wee reese at short
but first base is up for grabs
are you catching my drift
i dont need a glove to do that
coach sukeforth getting balls from a bucket hitting grounders down to jack at first
the short hops are wicked
jack rolls his catches over to a little panamanian kid who chucks them down to his brother who tosses them back to sukeforth
as jack struggles
el es muy malo
rickey said he wants you playing conspicuous baseball
to be so good the dodgersll demand you on the team
so i thought about it awhile and then i looked up conspicuous in the dictionary
it means to attract notice or attention
jack dives spears a liner
sukeforth tilts back his cap
bobby bragan sits across from rickey looking defiant
bragan most of your teammates have recanted on this petition nonsense
are you really here to tell me you dont want to play with robinson
my friends back in birmingham would never forgive me
and your friends here in brooklyn
bragan just shrugs then i will accommodate you
if you give me your word that you will try your very best for this team until i can work out a trade
that gets bragans goat
he jumps up really mad
do you think i would quit on anyone
i dont quit
only on yourself apparently
you can go bragan
time slowed way down as jack takes a throw at second from the montreal shortstop
he pivots to turn the double play even as dixie walker barrels in low
all jackies focus on the task at hand as he throws while walker submarines him
he lands in a heap tangled up together
they both look back to see the result of the play
as robinson smiles and walker scowls we know
send dixie in
sitting down across from rickey
i received your letter dixie
recently the thought has occurred to me that a change of ball clubs would benefit both the brooklyn baseball club and myself
this is about robinson
im keeping my reasons private
hope you can respect that sir
i realize dixie that you have a southern upbringing that you would have to subordinate your feelings for the welfare of this venture
i for one would deeply appreciate it
i think we can all learn something
what i have mr
rickey is a hardware store back home
its called dixie walkers
folks dont come because i have the lowest prices they come because its called dixie walkers
and i make as much money owning that store as i do playing for you
is that what youre you afraid of
he doesnt answer bragans a third stringer but you bat clean up
youre popular in brooklyn
children look up to you
you got my letter can i go
ill start looking for a trade or a sale
but it wont happen until i get value in return
until then i expect you to drive in runs
i always have
thats my job
jack exits with his luggage
looking for a cab he sees smith waiting
smith offers a salute
jack looks grumpy as he steps over
the buick waiting beyond
smith leans back blinks
something wrong with that jack
jack continues past
as smith follows
a glum silence in the car until
they cant keep you on montreal for long
after these exhibition games theyve got to bring you up
you dont have two words to rub together do you
do i have to entertain you
more silence then
you ever wonder why i sit out in right field with my typewriter on my knees
does that ever cross your mind
jack stares out the passenger window not in the mood
as he looks up at some of the taller buildings they pass
its because negro reporters arent allowed in the press box
jack doesnt answer doesnt look over
finally smith starts talking to himself
pretending to be jack
smith a as jack you know wendell i never asked you where you were from
why im from detroit jack
smith a as jack you dont say
tell me more
my daddy used to work at fair lane
that was mr
my daddy was mr
henry fords cook
smith a as jack i did not know that
cooked for him for years but never once broke bread with him
id go to work with daddy sometimes
play baseball out on the lawn with mr
we all had a real good time
but it was understood if they got tired of playing ball and moved inside to the bowling alley or swimming pool i was not invited or allowed
the grass was as far as i got
so guess what
youre not the only one with something at stake here
after a beat if i start talking will you stop
id be happy to
smith stops at a red light
youve been there for me through this more than anyone besides rae and mr
but i guess thats what bothers me
how do you mean
i dont like needing someone to be there for me
i dont like needing anyone but myself
i never have
you are a hard case jack robinson
is it okay if i keep driving you or should i let you out so you can walk
jack bursts out laughing
so does smith
you remember the last time we were at a red light
down in florida
new york city now baby
weve come a long way
and we got a long way to go
the light turns green
off they go
rickey reads to parrott from the new york sun
branch rickey cannot afford to upset team chemistry and so the only thing keeping robinson off the dodgers now plainly is the attitude of the players
if it softens at the sight of jackies skills hell join the club some time between april and april
otherwise robinson will spend the year back in montreal
throws paper down for the love of pete he batted in the exhibition games against them us them against us
rickey flummoxed as the phone rings from the outer office
maybe you could have durocher hold a press conference
demand that he get robinson on his team
of course hes my ace in the hole
very good harold
the phone still rings
rickey looks to his open door
are you out there
grumbling brambly eyebrows twitching he makes the mistake of answering his own phone
youre speaking to him

always jovial a head like an anvil with hair parted in the middle he picks up a phone

what can i do for you happy
branch how would you feel about losing durocher for a year
rickey switches the phone from one ear to the other
im sorry happy i thought you said lose durocher for a year
he was seen in havana with known gamblers
anyone who sets foot in havana is seen with known gamblers
its not just one thing its an accumulation
i received notice today from the catholic youth organization
vowing a ban on baseball unless durocher is punished for his moral looseness
its this business with the actress in california
shes recently divorced and durocher is the cause
they may even be illegally married
now im sure youre joking
happy checks his nails returns his hand to the manicurist
i wish i were

they draw a lot of water and i cant afford to ruffle their feathers
am i mixing metaphors there
you know very well my organization is about to enter a tempest
i need durocher at the rudder
hes the only man who can handle this much trouble who loves it in fact
youre chopping off my right hand
i have no choice
im going to have to sit your manager branch
leo durocher is suspended from baseball for a year
you cant do that
happy you son of a bitch
rickey steadies himself looks to parrott

durocher in a suit cleans out his locker
carefully sets each item in a cardboard box
finished he closes the locker door
and then wham
drives his fist in taking it off its hinges
he picks up his box quietly walks out
jack asleep in bed fumbles for the receiver

he has a contract for you to sign
that wakes him up
jack sits at the desk
he looks back over his shoulder at the goldfish
as one of them stares back rickey enters with the contract in question
he sets it down before jack hands him a pen
im so sorry about the rush
events are unfolding too fast to keep up with
the burden has finally fallen to me and so be it
as jack poises the pen rickey suddenly aghast
the pen a millimeter over the page
and im blabbing blabbing through history
rushing it along
what am i thinking
rickey sticks his head out the door
jane ann come in here
hollering down hall harold
parrott sticks his head out from an office down the hall
get some employees up here
where jack robinson signs his contract
as he sets the pen down rickey starts applauding
hes joined by parrott jane ann and a janitor
rickey claps jack on the shoulder

rachel lets out a triumphant whoop

a few lights twinkle but this city does occasionally sleep
this man does not
he stands bare chested in his boxers staring out the window of a mcalpin hotel room
considering the world before him
wondering where his place is in it
its a lonely moment

she wraps her arms around him looks over his shoulder at the world out there
i love you

on a troop transport coming back from guam
a sailor heard it on the radio told me the dodgers had signed a negro player
i said that was fine by me
then he said the guy was a shortstop
least you were then
that got me thinking
thinking gets me scared
jack smiles hefts his bottle of pepto
black white were both pink today huh
you still scared pee wee
looks down street of garbage trucks
the taj mahal of baseball
insert ebbets field
some guys quiet some guys joking around
everyone in some version of getting out of their street clothes or into their uniforms
the entire operation comes to a halt as jack enters
as he walks past some players nod hello
others look like sphinxes
walker turns and faces his locker
gene hermanski and branca step over to shake hands
welcome to brooklyn
last but not least spider jorgensen his montreal teammate
we made it jack huh
everyone else is too busy to come over
as jack scans for a locker with his name on it babe hamburger the clubhouse manager steps over
youre looking for your locker huh kid
they walk over to a hook on the wall
a uniform hangs from it
a folding chair below
i just got the word
best i could do
ill get you straightened out tomorrow though huh
jack nods unbuttoning his shirt
stanky is suddenly there
all pugnacity as he gives up inches and pounds to jack
youre putting on that uniform it means youre on my team
but before i play with you i want you to know how i feel about it
i want you to know i dont like it
i want you to know i dont like you
jack regards him
stanky doesnt flinch
maybe he should
thats how i prefer it
right out in the open
standing before his steaming hot dog stand
get your harry m
stevens special here
as he hands one over gets his
cents in return
then hey lady
rachel looks over baby jackie in her arms
the vendor takes a baby bottle out of the hot water in his steamer
i think its ready
looking at himself in a mirror
standing in his uniform the clean white wool the flowing script dodgers
we follow him past stanky as he goes
follow the blue on his back as he steps through the clubhouse
always on that magic number as he comes up through the dodger dugout and steps onto
photographers snap photos the crowd spot him and cheer
watches from the stands
pleased at the cheering
she holds the baby up to see whispers to him
okay okay thats good
as jackies eyes find hers
the dodgers down one baseline the boston braves down the other
forty nine white players and one black
jack at the end alongside ralph branca
jack trying not to choke up
oer the land of the free
and the home of the brave
the players not starting return to the dugout
bragan catches up with branca
youre crazy standing that close to him
what do you mean
what if the sharpshooter misses and hits you instead
you got a serious problem bragan you know that
i dont see it
surveying the scene
opening day harold
the world is all future and no past
a blank page sir
red barber looks down onto the field
one out in the bottom of the first
headed toward the plate for his first big league at bat is dodger rookie jackie robinson
jackie is very definitely brunette
walks toward the plate
were with you jackie
hey boy how about a shine
jack struggles not to look back at the source of the jeer
he settles in at the plate
johnny sain on the mound waiting for the sign
the crowd buzzing
sain looking in
when hes got that fastball working he can toss a lamb chop past a hungry wolf
the braves catcher signals a
here come the pitch
its down the third base line
the third baseman is going to need every ounce of his arm as he fields it at the line throw across his body to first
where jacks foot hits the bag an instant before the ball smacks into the first basemans mitt
jack cant believe it
as he trots toward the dugout he looks at the umpire who looks back i dare you to complain
as the brooklyn faithful boo the call rachel and smith watch jack head decisively toward the dugout
he was safe
rickey sits down closer to the dugout
its a game of inches jackie
get some glasses ump
burt shotton walks down the hallway with parrott
hows florida burt
roses need pruning but fine when i left it last night
branch said it was important and i heard about leo
any idea what this is about
youd better just talk to him
a beat as they reach the door
rickey smiles from his desk as they enter
baseball has returned to brooklyn burt
another season is underway
yeah its a shame about leo
inevitable i suppose
i asked him if she was worth it and he said yes
hows the retirement
the roses its a helluva thing when a man has good health and enough money and absolutely nothing to do
im perfectly happy
is that so
when i took off that cleveland uniform two years ago i promised the mrs
id never put on another uniform again
roses look great and i sleep a whole lot better
roses and sleep are two wonderful things burt
but sleep you can get inside your casket and flowers look good on top of it
you dont look like a dead man to me
whats this about branch
i need you to manage the dodgers
were a ship without a captain theres a typhoon ahead
no im sorry but no
do you miss the game burt
look me in the eye and tell me you dont
shotton considers rickey a beat and then looks away
baseballs the only life for an old pepper pot like me but i promised my wife branch
you promised her you wouldnt put on another uniform
you didnt promise her you wouldnt manage
wear a suit and tie connie mack still does
you remember how to get to the polo grounds burt
branch i you remember what the peanuts smell like roasting how the crack of the bat sounds the roar of the crowd
rickey tosses him a set of car keys
my cars parked right out front
harold will show you where
now what do you say
shotton addresses the half dressed dodgers jack included
men i dont have much to say
just dont be afraid of old burt shotton as a manager
you can win the pennant in spite of me
i can not possibly hurt you
the dodgers trade looks
not exactly inspirational
as shotton heads out he pauses by jack
are you robinson
i thought so
shotton pats jack on the shoulder continues on his way
a huge crowd beyond
bob cooke of the herald tribune seen at the waldorf astoria holds court as jack is announced
mark my words and circle this date
negroes are going to run the white man straight out of baseball
im not prejudiced its physiological
they have a longer heel bone
gives em an unfair speed advantage
standing dead still at the plate bat cocked and ready
jackie holds that club down by the end
rear foot on the back line of the box
slight open stance bent at the knees
giants pitcher dave koslo goes into his wind up and throws
the ball screams out to left
the crowd goes crazy
this is what they came to see
typewriters pounding away as jack finishes his home run trot
bob cooke watching thoughtfully as
was that because his heels are longer bob
as everyone cracks up everyone but bob
jack and rachel out for dinner
jack nodding as black patrons pass by saying encouraging things
he almost gets a forkful of food to his mouth before a menu and a pen are offered for an autograph
as he signs a flash bulb goes off
in a lull jack cuts his steak low to rachel
im not complaining i just i dont know what they want
they want to see if jackie robinson is real
they want to see your pride your dignity
because then theyll see it in themselves
hes stopped short
she blinks with mock coquettish modesty
im just young and scared and amazed at how brave you are
he grins at her almost gets a forkful in when lawson bowman the black owner pulls up a chair shakes jacks hand
im lawson bowman jack the owner of this joint
hows the steak
im not sure yet
it looks good
bathroom mirror steamed
a finger traces a in the steam on the glass then wipes it clean to reveal rachel
hair wrapped in a towel she looks at herself frowns
insert brooklyn april
drying diapers hang like pennants on a line stretched across the bedroom
rachel ducks under them to retrieve her shoes
she looks at them frowns
rachel brushing her teeth
pauses to hold the toothbrush in a batting stance
rachel strains to reach to zip her dress up
she pulls at the edges of the dress straightens herself out
she looks over at jack jr
who watches from his crib
youre lucky youre a boy
doorway dressed to go rachel holding the baby looking anxiously out on the street
suddenly alice the baby sitter is there
here she comes up the steps opens the door
sorry im late
class ran long
rachel gently hands the baby over
its so cold and raw out i dont want him getting sick at the game
hell be nice and warm here
checks her watch im going to be late
she kisses him goodbye frowns as she heads outside a forboding sky above as rachel hurries along
pulling her jacket on as she goes
its going to be a cold day
the skys are leaden
eddie stanky safe at first as robinson steps to the plate
the bottom of the first
the crowd cheers
stanky safe on first
the skys are leaden
eddie stanky safe at first as robinson steps to the plate
jack walk to the plate digs a cleat into the batters box
hey you black nigger
jack looks to the visitors dugout where the phillies alabama born manager ben chapman stands at the top of the steps
why dont you go back to the cotton fields where you belong
the bear baiting has begun
jack is in a kind of temporary shock
thats the phillies manager
or did you swing your way out of the jungle
bring me a banana
chapman the phillies manager up on the top step seems to be chirping something out to robinson
chapman a hothead during his playing days with the yankees
sitting next to parrott
he leans forward unsure
whats he saying
chapman joined by two of his phillie bench players
go home nigger
go back to africa
phillie pitcher dutch leonard looks in
jack has to try to concentrate on the pitch
here it comes
a fastball well inside
jack hits the deck to keep from getting beaned
you sure can dance snowflake
on first mouth hanging open
almost forgets to take a lead
its an instant rorschach test
shotton and the players look stricken
even walker doesnt quite know what to make of it
no one enjoys it but higbe
concession men walk closer to listen
the fans range from horrified to some mildly pleased
rachel looks stricken
a fastball inside
he leaps back again
this one was even closer to hitting him
as jack glares at dutch
hey black boy
hey shoe shine
jack doesnt want to look over but he is compelled
the bench players flanking chapman look furious but chapman is doing this with a sick sort of glee
you like white girls
which one of them dodger boys wives are you climbing on tonight
chapman looks toward
they dont like that one
oh i think i got it
dixie i believe i know
grips the bat
watches for the next pitch with bloody mindedness
he hacks at it lofts a routine fly into left
hes about halfway down to first when the left fielder catches it and jack can mercifully return to the dugout
rickey watches as he disappears inside
jack sits down
no one says anything to him
no one comes near him as he stares ahead trapped in a kind of void
the closest player to him is bobby bragan
bragan finally manages to glance over at him then looks quickly away
as the dodgers take the field jack heads to first
almost wincing wondering if its going to start again
under her breath look at me baby
look at me
finally jack glances up to her
she offers her eyes im with you
he looks away
her witnessing makes it worse
settles back in the shadows of the dugout
finished for now
bottom of the rd
spider jorgensen takes a lead off first
at the plate stanky lines a single to right
jorgensen holds at second
steps to the batters box starts digging in that back foot
as chapman emerges with his two bench players
hey nigger lips
partys over jungle bunny
hey pee wee
whats this nigger doing for you all to let him drink from the same water fountain as you
i hope its worth it
waiting for the pitch
takes a mighty swing cracks a towering pop up between home plate and the mound
dutch watches his catcher seminick settle under it
hey is that a home run
if youre playing in an elevator shaft
jack veers off the first baseline
heads for the dugout
you dont belong
look in a mirror
this is a white mans game
get it through your thick monkey skull
jack stops short looks at him
chapman stands his ground
praying this doesnt go south
as jack finally continues on rickey closes his eyes in relief
sick for her husband
jack stalks down past the team
no one looks at him
bragan is ashamed
dixie tries to look disinterested
stanky and reese exchange a helpless glance as jack continues into like a bull on his way to slaughter he revolts
he proceeds to turn his bat into splinters
concrete chips wood flies
jack drops the handle of the bat pounds his fists
heaving for breath framed by the empty tunnel
raw electric ungovernable
all the anger on display the fury
jack looks up to see rickey standing there watching afraid to get too much closer
to hell with this
the next white son of a bitch who opens his mouth ill smash his goddamn teeth in
rickey stands there until finally opening his mouth
you cant jackie
you know it
im supposed to let this go on
these men have to live with i have to live with myself too
and right now im living a sermon out there
im through with it
jack is at the end of his rope
all rickey has are words
you dont matter right now jack
youre in this thing
you dont have the right to pull out from the backing of people who believe in you respect you and who need you
is that so
if you fight they wont say chapman forced you to theyll just say that youre over your head
that you belong where you are
that every downtrodden man who wants more from life is over his head
jacks either going to explode or break into tears
do you know what its like having someone do this to you
youre the one living the sermon
in the wilderness
all of it
and not a damn thing i can do about it
of course there is
you can stand up and hit
you can get on base and you can score
you can win this game for us
we need you as well
everyone needs you
a beat exhausted youre medicine jack
rickey reaches out touches the wall to stay standing
jack just breathes as familiar sounds reverb down the tunnel
theyre taking the field
whos playing first
jack considers him
everything hangs in the balance
then im gonna need a new bat
as jack heads back down the tunnel for the field
eight zeros hang for the phillies
seven for the dodgers
no score the bottom of the th coming up
steps into the batters box
chapman and his sidekicks step from the stygian abyss of the visitors dugout
hey black nigger
i know you can hear me
if you were a white boy you know where youd be right now
on a bus headed down to newport news cuz you cant play for shit
here comes the pitch
jack nonchalantly sticks his bat out pokes a soft hit past second
a nothing hit but hes standing on first
and he looks well ferocious in fact
as pete reiser steps up into the batters box
jack stares at dutch leonard
assassins eyes as he takes an insolent in your face lead off first
dutch fires to first
jack dives back safe
back on his feet he spits out a piece of grit he picked up sliding back on his belly
not bothering to dust himself off hes turning into something elemental before our eyes
up in the booth
two strikes now to reiser as leonard looks in
robinson with another big lead off first
hes as restless as a cat with a hot foot
steal it sweetheart
jack on the run as reiser swings and misses strike three
and seminick comes up throwing
jack slides into second the throw high ends up in center
half a dozen dodgers impulsively on their feet and waving him on as jack gets to his feet and motors into third
the throw well late
phillies third baseman handley throws the ball back to dutch
handley then looks to jack
i want you to know what goes on here it dont go for me
jack barely nods but he heard
hermanski steps up
dutch looking to third nodding distracted at a sign looking back to third before
hermanski cracks a single to left
as jack crosses the plate he stares down chapman on his way to the dugout
as chapman turns his head spits several reporters around chapman as well
he drinks a beer
you fellas are making too big a deal out of this
he scored we lost
one to nothing
do you think you were a little hard on robinson
we treat him the same way we do hank greenburg except we call hank a kike instead of a coon
when we play exhibitions against the yankees we call dimaggio the wop
they laugh at it
no harm its forgotten after the game ends
chapman tosses away his beer can
dont you think this was maybe one foot over the line
lets get the chips off our shoulders and play ball
its a game right
jack alone in the shower
water beating down
a warrior who survived another day of battle
they say the lord doesnt ask us to bear any more than were able but god is cutting it pretty damn close here
he is in pain
rickey sits brooding thinking
parrott enters upset
im going in that phillie dugout tomorrow and wring chapmans neck
rickey considers parrott starts laughing
parrott is hurt
did i say something funny
when i first told you about jackie you were against it
now all of a sudden youre worrying about him
how do you suppose that happened
well any decent minded person sympathy harold is a greek word
it means to suffer
i sympathize with you means i suffer with you
this philadelphia manager has done me a service
is there an echo in here
yes hes creating sympathy on jackies behalf
philadelphia by the way is greek for brotherly love
the intercom buzzes
bob bragan to see you mr
what in satans fire does he want
send him in
rickey pretends to review papers as bragan enters his hat literally in his hand
rickey lets him stand there a moment
what do you want bragan
id like not to be traded sir if it isnt too late
what about robinson
bragans been staring at the floor
he looks up now
the low afternoon sun hits his face
id like to be his teammate
the worlds changing i guess i can live with the change
red sox just offered ted williams but ill see what i can do
thank you mr
rickey looks at parrott a what do you know
jack exits sees her hadnt expected her
you shouldnt have waited
they havent made a day long enough that i wouldnt wait for you
give these boys time
its a three game series
a beat between them framed by the steel girders around them
i dont care if they like me i didnt come here to make friends
i dont even care if they respect me
i know who i am i got enough respect for myself
but i do not want them to beat me
they are never going to beat you
theyre taking their best shot
i dont want you coming tomorrow
i dont want you to watch that them beating me
wherever you are i am too
look at me
he looks over
its not easy for this most proud of men
i have to watch
so our hearts dont break
plus i already bought a scorecard
she holds it up
his name the only one filled in
and i put your name on it
he puts his hand out takes hers
i did good the day i met you
baby you hit a home run
the scoreboard shows run scored by the phillies in the top of the first
jack steps up to the plate
here we go again
the next day
hey porch monkey
you know why youre here
on the bench
without warning he blasts off it
move with him as he marches toward chapman who doesnt see him coming
youre here to draw those nigger dollars at the gate for rickey
chapman clocks the apoplectic stanky
spit flying as sit down
sit down or ill sit you down
whats the problem stank
youre the problem you goddamn disgrace
what kind of man are you
you know he cant fight
pick on someone who can fight
eddie stanky having a chin wag with his ex teammate chapman
both men masters of distraction
eddie of course from second
chapman from the dugout
stanky so mad he cant see straight
as chapman disappears into his dugout jack whacks a single
stanky sits here stewing
his head down
robinson on first pete reiser at bat
reiser belts it
a long one
deep into left center
back goes ennis who is not tall enough
this ones off the wall
robinson is going to score from first
over barber a crack of the bat the roar of the crowd
as players around him react stanky finally looks up as robinson crosses the plate heads in sits a few feet from stanky
youre on my team
what the hell am i supposed to do
i gotta look in the mirror too
stanky stands walks away
todays gonna be okay
a black preacher leads his congregation in prayer
lord make me an instrument of your peace
where there is hatred let me sow love
where there is injury let me sow pardon
where there is darkness let me sow light
we see rickey sits in the back row the day heavy on him
a young girl turns looks at him
whys a white man here
rickey smiles puts a finger to his lips
players put on their uniforms as higbe in street clothes fires the contents of his locker into a cardboard box
i speak my mind and they trade me
this aint the america i know
he glares down to jacks locker
jack regards him back
its higbe who looks away first
he continues packing
where are they sending you hig
for cash and some i talian outfielder named gionfriddo
dixie walker takes batting practice drives the ball all over the field
rickey and shotton watch from behind the backstop
do you remember the story burt of the sheep
how one was missing
if youre talking about dixie id leave the word sheep out of it
i find myself at odds
i want integration and the pennant
i want to punish dixie and at the same time i want his salvation
cant he just be a good ballplayer
he has to be a good person too
it would be so much simpler if he wasnt batting
as walker finishes he passes jack whose turn it is
shes all yours robinson
as thunder rumbles in the distance
rain beats on the windows
rickey looks over as parrott rushes in hes out of breath and dripping wet
parrott holds up the herald tribune sports section
the news isnt good sir
nevertheless it must be accepted calmly harold
what is it
a headline players strike
a national league players strike instigated by some of the st
louis cardinals against the presence of negro first baseman jackie robinson has been averted temporarily and perhaps permanently quashed
what are they thinking
wendell smith waits under an umbrella as the cardinals get off the team bus
smith buttonholes manager eddie dyer
eddie whats all this talk about your cardinals refusing to play
were here arent we
we didnt come to new york to go to macys
dyer continues past him
here comes big joe garagiola
hey garagiola get lost
here comes stan musial a class act if there ever was one
hey stan whats the story
this is big league baseball not english tea
couple a guys mightve popped off its hot air
smith types out his report
as rain lashes the window the empire state building looms a few block away
louis didnt win the world championship last year without using their heads
they have the same heads this year and should know that they cant pick the players of another club
jack sits here alone tending to a bat
cleaning it with rubbing alcohol handling it like the friend it is
rickey joins him
he has a newspaper in hand
he holds it up
national league president frick says this is america and baseball is americas game
he says one citizen has as much right to play as another
baseball will go on as planned once the rain stops
jack eyes his bat
why are you doing this mr
because my job is to win
i have an obligation to brooklyn to put the best team on the field i can
your presence on the roster increases our chances of winning
not buying it jack looks over at him
if this is winning id hate to see us on a losing streak
guys change into their street clothes
branca reads to reese from the new york post
walker listens in from his locker
listen to this right now robinson is the loneliest man i have ever seen in sports
whos this guy to say jackies lonely
he doesnt wear it on his sleeve
mans got one helluva game face
take no prisoners
how does some reporter know how he feels
they stop talking as robinson walks past the last one into the shower a couple of towels around him
i say its the best game face in the world
so long as he showers lonely he can have whatever face he wants
rachel sitting here
this section about two thirds full
then about five rows behind her two racist fans find their seats
they spot jack down at first
look there he is
black as the ace of spades
you believe that
a genuine nigger in a dodger uniform
as rachel winces at his words shut up and go back to st
hey you got a nigger on your team
hes better than anyone you got
waitll his cousin wants your job
dont you know nothing
hes a nigger
hey black boy
rachel stares ahead tries to maintain
she shows them her back sits up as straight as she can
her movements heroic
jack steps up against the cardinals
garagiola the catcher shouts down to third
watch this guy
he cant hit
especially the curve
he can only get on base bunting
as jack digs into the box
take your time robinson youre digging your own grave
big red munger looks in for the sign
garagiola flashes a sign a
wants it inside
heres the pitch
jack just scoots back
takes a fastball in on the hands
robinson who is pitched to a great deal that way uses a thicker handle bat than most hitters just because he hits a lot of balls out on his hands
jack edges up closer to the plate
whats your average joe
itd be a lot higher than yours if i could run as fast as you can
no matter how fast you run youll never hit as much as you weigh
garagiola signals for another fastball
boys got a hole in his bat
munger throws inside
jack falls back strokes a double into the gap
that one wasnt quite a in enough
robinson punishing the redbirds with a smart piece of hitting
the brooklyn fans cheer the racist fan sulks
the double is little comfort to rachel who stares ahead sitting as straight up as she can
willing herself not to cry
jack and rachel ride home
forlorn she stares out
what is it rae
its just sometimes when i sit up there with those bastards those loudmouths in the stands i know you can hear them
no its not okay
and i can hear them too
jack looks at her takes her hand in his
im sorry for that
rachel squeezes his hand back
were in it together
when they start in on you you know what i do
i try to sit up as straight
straight as i can
i got it in my head that i can block it from you some of it if i sit up straight
a sad smile isnt that dumb
closing the space between them he takes her hand
i didnt hear a thing
she tries to smiles
as the tears streak her cheeks he leans in kisses her forehead
theyre just ignorant
if they knew you theyd be ashamed
she puts her arm around him draws that strength
i am holding on
long as we hold on itll be okay
rachel and rickey watch jack taking batting practice
you look lovely mrs
i dont know how you do it
every day from the st to the th
i could pay for a suit and in twenty minutes id look like i fell out of bed
even my shoes look rumpled
they watch jack crack one high off the schaefer beer sign
i used to think jack was conceited
is that so
it was the very first thing i noticed about him
how did you two meet
i saw him at a ucla football game
even in uniform with a helmet on his vanity was awful
it was the way he held his hands on his hips
i hated him
and on campus he always wore crisp white shirts and id think his skin is so dark why would he do that
then i got to know him his pride and confidence and i realized he was showing off his color
i was wrong
he wasnt conceited he was proud
always of who and what he is
id never met another man like that
what about you
how did you meet your wife
trying to catch her in a race
she was the fastest girl in town
i finally caught up weve been together ever since
they sit a moment
below jack nails another one
i wanted to apologize to you
i cant apologize to him
he and i both knew what we were getting into
a newlywed trying to blossom a marriage under all this pressure
dont worry about me
we know who we are
jack hits another
your husband has humbled me
when this all began i thought i was changing the world and that jackie was my instrument
can you imagine
i wish i could help him but im just a spectator
you help him plenty
they watch him rip into another pitch
is he able to get things off his chest
so he doesnt burn up
i have to let him have that silence at first let him come to me
but he opens up eventually
its too much to carry inside
does he have any friends on the team
she gives him a look theyre spectators too
they do admire him though
rachel looks out to where reese and stanky play catch
do you think so
even the worst of us recognizes courage
moral courage especially
i have to think they see it
jackies a man on trial
hes responding with glory and grace
no one can take their eyes off him
hes had himself on trial since the day i met him
no man is harder on himself or gets to himself worse than jack
but i hope his team mates know theyre on trial too
i suppose we all are
youre an astute woman mrs
i have to be mr
rickey im married to a man of destiny
i cant let him down
if id met you first i wouldnt have looked so long for jackie
how do you mean
i mean if he was good enough for you hes certainly good enough for the rest of us
phillie gm herb pennock at his desk on the phone
branch its herb
what can i do for you herb
how long have we known each other
then trust me when i say brooklyns due here tomorrow but you can not bring that nigger down here with the rest of your team
rickey grits his teeth stays civil
and whys that herb
his names jackie robinson by the way
were just not ready for this sort of thing in philadelphia
goldenrod rev aa
im not sure well be able to take the field against your team if that boy is in uniform
herbert what your team does is your decision
but my team is coming to philadelphia
if we have to claim the game as a forfeit we will
thats in case you forgot
branch youve got one helluva hair across your ass on this thing and i for one would like to know what youre trying to prove
do you think god likes baseball
what the hell does that mean
it means youre going to meet god one day herb and when he inquires why robinson wasnt on the field in philadelphia and you answer because he was a negro
it may not be a sufficient reply
as rickey hangs up the phone
the dodger team bus pulls up
the doors whoosh open parrott steps off looking official
as the players start to follow insert may
benjamin franklin hotel philadelphia
come on fellas
we have twenty minutes to check in and then get to shibe
no one is listening as the team driver opens the lower compartment and the players including jack grab their bags
get that bus out of here
the hotel manager stalks over flanked by hotel security
were the dodgers
we have a reservation
your teams not welcome not while you have ballclub negroes with you
you mean robinson cant stay here
i mean the entire team is refused
weve been staying here ten years
and you can stay away that long
last off the bus hold on now lets talk about this
the hotel manager jerks his thumb like an umpire
hey hold on you
security getting between as shotten and the manager go at it
jack is embarrassed but what can he do
walker says to no one in particular but loud enough for jack to hear maybe s got enough friends in town we can bunk up
whats that supposed to mean
its just i know when you cant get into a hotel you got peoples houses you can stay at
what do you want from me walker
places like this
parrott alarmed at this turn of events
for turning this season into a sideshow
im a ballplayer i want to play ball

it might do you some good the way youre swinging the bat lately
watch your mouth
walker jabs his chest with a finger jack bats his hand away
watch your damn hand
and theyre lunging at each other
separated by reese stanky branca and bragan while other players hold off shotton
two fights about to break out at the same time
ill show you grandpa
parrott summons something deep lets loose a shrill whistle
take the bus to the field

ill find another hotel
ben chapman sits across from herb pennock who flips through underlined newspaper reports
pennock reads one there is a great lynch mob among us they go unhooded and work without rope
looks at him thats you not me
reads some more we must remember that all this countrys enemies are not beyond the frontiers of our home land
some jew mustve wrote that
this doesnt look good ben
it makes the phillies look racist
youve got to do something
hes trying to work up the nerve for something
finally he comes around the corner where jack sits at his locker talking to smith
jackie excuse me um a request came in
the phillies manager ben chapman hed like his photo taken with you
jack pretends to sniff the air around parrott
you been drinking harold
rickey thinks its a good idea
he says itll be in every sports page in the country
an example thatll show everyone even the most hardened man can change
chapman hasnt changed
hes just trying to take the heat off
rickey says it doesnt matter if hes changed
as long as it looks like hes changed
chapman said hed come down here
or meet you in the runway
as jack slow burns
see the ball come in slow
see the photo come in slower
tell him on the field
where everyone can see him
as parrott smiles hes done it
chapman and jack stand side by side facing the press
chapman makes a little speech
hypocrisy at its best
jackies been accepted in baseball and the philadelphia organization wish him all the luck we can
i only hope in some small way our trial of fire
helped him along
jack looks at him did he just say that
how about a picture
bury the hatchet
you want a picture
jack steps to the on deck circle grabs a baseball bat
chapmans eyes widen as he starts toward him with it
low to chapman well hold the bat
that way we dont have to touch skin
chapman nods looks relieved
a photographer hands over a bat
chapman has two hands on the handle
jack puts one hand on the barrel the other stays on his hip
ben i hope all your friends back home like the picture
jack smiles as the flashbulbs go off
chapman looks dumb
by the dugout with stanky watches in disbelief
carl i swear i never thought id see ol ben eat shit like that
fritz ostermueller on the mound
he takes a long look in at jack at his catcher kluttz who flicks his thumb a hit him
here it comes
all jack has time to do is cover his face to lessen the blow
beaned in the head he goes down in a heap
branca leads the dodger players out onto the field
the umpires move to head them off
pirates as well
kirby higbe now in a pirate uniform claps his hands pleased
in his face ostermeuller you kraut
you gotta bat too
dont you forget
im ready you wop bastard
its gonna come right between your eyes
like a kamikaze
he doesnt belong here
you dont belong here

as an umpire gets between them jack sits up
rickey looks up as reese enters
he holds a letter
what can i do for you pee wee
rickey its like this the series in cincinnati next week
its an important road trip were only three games out of first
you know im from kentucky
cincinnatis nearly a home game for you
i got this letter sir
i guess some people arent too happy about me playing with robinson
rickey is not liking where this is going he motions for the letter scans it reads the highlights
we will get you carpetbagger
holds it out typical stuff
reese takes the letter back a little hurt
its not typical to me
how many of these letters have you gotten pee wee
aint that enough
rickey looks reese over a moment
pushing back his chair he steps over to a filing cabinet
motioning reese to join him he pulls open a drawer pulls out a inch stack of flattened letters then another then a third
he looks to reese
what are those
ill tell you what they arent they arent letters from the jackie robinson fan club
here he thrusts a sheaf of it into reeses hands
as reese flips through the stack of hate reads get out of baseball or your baby boy will die
quit baseball or your nigger wife will be
reese trails off wont say it out loud
skips to another
get out of the game or be killed
he looks at one more reacts to the vitriol but does not utter it
reese looks back at rickey shocked
does jackie know
of course he knows
and the fbi
theyre taking a threat in cincinnati pretty seriously
so excuse me if im not too shocked at you being called a carpetbagger
you should be proud of it
wed just like to play ball mr
thats all we want to do
i bet jackie just wants to play ball
i bet he wishes he wasnt leading the league in hit by pitch
i bet he wishes people didnt want to kill him
but the world isnt so simple anymore
im not sure it ever was
we just baseball ignored it
now we cant
i gotta get to practice
in the stands
looking at the men around him his own father shouting at jack as the dodgers take the field the reds coming off it
jack headed for first

cincinnati fans expressing their displeasure as the dodgers take the field

the brat eddie stanky at second
spider jorgensen at third
and the captain pee wee reese at shortstop
ask any man and theyll tell you that the gillette superspeed razor is a honey
maybe the sweetest shaving razor youll ever use
jack reaches first throws the ball around the infield
many in the crowd beyond rise to jeer and heap abuse
jack tries to let it wash over him
at short reese receives the ball moves to throw to first when he pauses
deciding he suddenly moves to trot across the diamond until hes alongside jack
now cries of carpetbagger
pee wee how can you play with this black bastard
reese stares up at the worst hecklers along the first base line
he looks a little sad
they can say what they want were here to play baseball
just a bunch of crackpots still fighting the civil war
hell wed a won that son of a gun if the cornstalks had held out
we just ran out of ammunition
reese has a funny way of saying it

reese impulsively puts his arm around jacks shoulder stares into the cincy dugout

walker reacting out in right
the crowd shuts down some in shock at the gesture
jack surprised also

jack moved by pee wees gesture cant find the words
robinson and reese conferring at first
maybe discussing an infield shift on baumholtz

that way they wont be able to tell us apart
reese heads for short
jack pounds his fist in his glove
jack playing gin rummy with branca reese and wendell smith
to smith teasing you ever write about white guys in your paper

its been double trouble as robinson knocked in stanky with a double in the third
walker strokes a double over stankys head as stanky breaks off second for third
and dixie walker did the same with a double in the eighth
enos slaughter steps in for st
hugh casey on the mound for brooklyn
slaughter looks fiercely determined
it wasnt enough as the cardinals tied it with two of their own in the top of the ninth
this game is crucial to the red birds
theyre five games out the dodgers having not relinquished first place sine june th
casey throws a pitch
inside a ball
slaughter takes ball one low
casey in his second inning of relief
this game is tighter than a new pair of shoes on a rainy day
slaughter hitless in four trips as casey goes into his wind up
slaughter swings hits a hard ground ball right at reese who fires over to jack at first
slaughter is out by fifteen feet but he never slows down
and his foot comes down high on jacks right calf
slaughters spiked him something wicked
jack goes down in a heap clutching his leg blood already seeping through his high socks
slaughter head down on his way to the visitors dugout as dodger players pour out of their own to protest
as the ump raises his hands motions them all back
jack pulls up his sock a bloody mess
stanky looks to casey
next batter throw right at his head
clean his clock just get him out
games too important
as casey nods jack reaches up to stanky and reese
they pull him to his feet
jack looks finds rachel in the stands
as he gives her a little wave a im okay
a big cardinal slugger at bat
the top of the th and kurowski at the plate
he hit his th home run on monday so caseys going to want to be careful with him
the pitch grooves in and kurowski nails it
there goes number
the cardinals leading going into the bottom of the th
the stadium electric as jack steps in his left leg bloody
he takes an inside pitch at the knees
here comes the next one

he rounds hard returns to the bag
reiser stepping up to the plate as musial holds jack on at first
jack in a fury

glances at blood i dont blame you man you got every right
jack running on the pitch
the play is to first
reiser is out and jack slides safe into second
schoendienst has the sense to vacate before he gets there
bouncing up and down wearing that badge of potential violence and action
the crowd buzzing the electricity practically hits you in the face
jacks going to score
coming up out of his seat along with the fans around him
walker at bat
jack steps out checks on marion the shortstop
he takes another step out looks to schoendienst
over it all munger sets
robbie back and forth off second
the third bag clearly in his sights
oh and munger deals a pick off throw to marion at second and robinson is out
marion breaks for the bag and munger turns and fires a strike
marion brings down the tag out
he is and he knows it
the crowd stunned into silence
jack frozen a moment head down furious with himself
the cardinals pick up a game
it was one of those plays where you do or you dont and jackie didnt
jack on his stomach as stitches are sewn into his leg
reporters in front of him
did he spike you on purpose
you saw the play
i had my foot inside the bag
he was out by a mile
but he kept coming
slaughter said it was an accident
what are you asking me for then
are you calling slaughter a liar
this guys a real jerk
rickey arrives a baseball in hand
let me talk to my first baseman
hes getting stitched up for petes sake
the reporters move off for other interviews
reporter two hesitant to let it go finally drifts off
sticking up for yourself is what youd expect of any man
some find it galling to see it in a negro
im sorry mr
sorry for what
i lost my cool out there
it probably cost us the game
i told you jackie all the best base runners get caught sometimes
i wasnt thinking
rickey pulls up a chair sits across from him leans in
do you know what i saw this morning
i was passing a sandlot and a little white boy was up to bat
you know what he was doing
sitting on a fastball
he was pretending he was you
wiping his hands on his pants swinging with his arms outstretched like you do
a little white boy pretending he was a black man
the two men who have done so much looking each other over
why are you doing this mr
we had victory over fascism in germany its time for victory over racism at home
why are you doing this
come on now
a long moment between them
finally rickey looks away
i love this game
i love baseball
ive given my life to it
forty odd years ago i was a player coach at ohio wesleyan university
we had a negro catcher best hitter on the team
rickey starts slowly rubbing the baseball in his hands
a fine young man
i saw him laid low
broken because of the color of his skin and i didnt do enough to help
i told myself i did but i didnt
the game i loved had something unfair at the heart of it
i ignored it
but a time came when i could no longer do that
you let me love baseball again
jacks eyes gentle on rickeys
rickey fighting back tears now retreats to his more confident self
youre a force of nature jackie youve complicated everything but yourself
youre changing the world and refusing to let it change you
i for one am in awe
jack reaches takes the baseball from him
a beat as they consider each other
finally a promise
i wont get picked off second base again
not this year
rachel watches from bed as jack finishes packing
she looks sad
jack looks into the cradle at jackie jr
its pops last long road trip of the year little man
careful you dont wake him
i dont like seeing you leave thats all
he looks at her a beat resumes packing
ill be home in a week
thats a long time without you
he doesnt answer packs away
finally try not to lunge at the plate
thats why theyre throwing the fastballs inside
he looks at her a little shocked
fight those inside fastballs off foul them back
sooner or later they wont be able to help but throw a curve
he steps to the bed leans over her
and whatll happen then
she clucks a hit sound makes an ahhhhhh crowd sound
we win enough of these next games and well bring home the pennant
where are we going to put a pennant
all these baby diapers hanging everywhere
jack looks around the room at the diapers hanging
we got room right over there
between number one and number two
she mock grimaces at his bad joke
win one if you have to but bring yourself home thatll be plenty
rae youre in my heart
promise me youll come home
that youll always come home
as he looks at all he loves in the world
jack exits macdonough street apartment building and makes his way down the street
a cardinal runner on second
jackie holding another runner on first as the st
louis crowd roars
on out for the cardinals in the eighth
anxious moments now as theyve cut the dodger lead to
nippy jones up
musial taking his place on deck
jones likes to punch that ball when he swings
casey on the mound receives the ball
pounds his glove
come on casey get him out
pitch that ball
the outfield is deep shaded toward left
robinson holding the runner on first
here comes casey with the pitch jones swings pops it up
its popped up foul toward first
should be out of play
but here comes robinson hes coming hard jack chasing down the foul headed right for the open steps of his own dugout
he never considers the peril as he catches the ball and his left foot comes down onto nothing branca leaps forward tackles jack back onto the infield
hes got it
and one of the dodgers has him
the dodgers closing in on the pennant as theyll leave st
louis for cincinnati and a three game series with the reds
jack sits in his grass stained pants after the game
most of the guys are in the shower
branca a towel around his waist is headed there himself
the sight of jack stops him
can i ask you something jackie
how come you never shower until everyone else is done
jack just stares at him
branca wont let it drop
you shy or something
i dont want to make anyone uncomfortable
were a team
on a hot streak
half the wins on account of you
youre the bravest guy i ever saw
youre leading us and youre afraid to take a shower
a beat as jack considers him
take a shower with me
hey i dont mean it like that
the dodgers showering guys chattering
suddenly theres branca and jack at the shower entrance
all eyes look over
a beat and everyone goes back to getting clean
its no big deal
dixie walker looks to the floor shakes his head
finally quietly he leaves
whos the loneliest man on the team now
as the phone rings rickey grabs it
insert september rickey here
on a payphone in the crosley field concourse
we did it boss
we did it
we swept cincinnati
that puts us seven games up
joyous rickey grabs a sheet showing the nl standings
and eliminates the giants and boston
he puts an a x through boston and the giants
the rest of the nl are already crossed out
only the cardinals remain
at the same time parrott xs the same out on his notebook
wed have to lose nearly every game for the cardinals to catch us now
one more win may do it
whos pitching tomorrow for the pirates
rachel walks pushing jackie junior in his stroller
as she moves the radio broadcast of the dodgers game can be heard from one house to the next
in a gap a passing car picks it up and we hear it from the window
then another house
a very big game today here in pittsburgh
a win and the dodgers will have clinched the national league pennant
branch rickey alone in the stadium
the field empty as he listens to the call of the game over the pa
fritz ostermueller on the mound
hes and on the season
ostermueller on the rubber
staring in at jack
you dont belong
youll never belong
here comes the pitch and robinson takes outside
listening as ostermueller winds and throws low and away ball two
fritz seems to be pitching around jackie
or trying to get him to chase
throw him a strike
shakes off one sign then nods at the next
throws the ball well outside
another pitch outside
a and now
robinson waiting on something he can swing on
as catcher kluttz throws it back
give me something i can hit
what are you afraid of
you want it
careful what you wish for boy
ostermueller nods at the sign
jack about to slay the dragon as the pitch comes in whack
the ball is going for a ride
that is a deep fly ball to left
kiner on his horse but i dont think hell get there
rickey standing looking up like he can see it
back back back and oh doctor
robinson got his pitch
the ball sails out home run
ostermueller hangs his head
rachel listening smiling as cheers sound from outside the apartment
we hear the sound of car horns on the street
he runs toward first and we run with him
the smile starts somewhere in his body
his heart most likely
by the time it reaches his face his joy has erupted
the weight of the world starting to drop
kirby higbe who watches robinson round the bases in disgust
nears second on his home run trot
even the pittsburgh crowd starting to applaud him
rickey absorbing the moment
its almost too much
rounding second and headed for third
the weight of the world somehow lifting
they gave him one he could hit
were tight on jacks back as he heads for home at forbes field
finally inspired to type t h a n k y o u j a c k i e
about to step on the plate
he closes his eyes as well and rachel all alone on the sidewalk looking up and down the street
and suddenly there he is
jack scooting between two cars hurrying to her
and theyre in each others arms
the babys sleeping so dont you make a sound
he makes to button his lips
stay just like that
she kisses him
and kisses him
and he kisses her back
as they finally head inside we let them go
