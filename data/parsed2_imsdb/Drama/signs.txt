night shyamalan we are looking out a second story window of a house
the backyard is large and green with a wooden jungle gym worn from use
a single tree throws shade onto a barbecue and a picnic table
the backyard is lined by crops
golden and brown
six feet high
everything is perfect
like a postcard
and then we hear a graham hess wakes up from his sleep
he thought he heard something
he hears the heater
the graham climbs out of bed
he moves in his pajama pants and white barrons minor league baseball t shirt towards the bedroom door
graham stands in the hall landing where three bedroom doors meet
he moves to the door that has childrens drawings taped to it
he puts his ear close
graham leans down and picks up two balled up sweat socks and a childs sweater from the hallway floor
he puts it in the hallway hamper before heading back into his bedroom
a bathroom door is open
we hear the sink running
we hear outside the bathroom on the bedroom wall is the sun faded outline of where a large catholic cross used to hang
its ghostly stained forever on the blank wall
the water from the sink stops
graham steps into the doorway
toothbrush and foam in his mouth
he becomes very still
the bedroom door bursts open
graham steps into his childrens room
there are childrens books everywhere
overflowing off shelves
piled in corners
grahams eyes move to the small messy beds
theyre both empty
merrill hess throws the bed sheets off himself as he swings onto his feet in one quick motion
he is hyper awake
merrill is in his late twenties
he is well build
his muscles are tense as he stands in his red bikini briefs and looks around bewildered
graham bangs open the back screen door and runs into the backyard
he spins as he looks around
merrill now with a t shirt and jeans rumbles down the side stairs adjacent to the garage building
merrill and graham make eye contact as they approach each other across the yard
where are they
graham looks around panic growing in his eyes
yelling in the distance daaaad
graham and merrill in unison turn in the direction of the yelling
they look away from the house across the yard and into the thick wall of crops
the tall stalks of corn smack graham and merrills faces as they run through the crops
a little girl appears in the crops thirty feet ahead of them like an apparition
she is in her nightgown
she is four
they reach her fast
she stands unaware of them in a daze
her hair is messed from sleep
bo wheres morgan
bo stands peacefully lost in her thoughts
bo finally looks at her father
she smiles softly
are you in my dreams too
this isnt a dad
graham looks in the direction of the boys voice
graham picks up bo and rushes through the crops
he finds morgan standing with his hands in the pockets of his pajama bottoms
dogs are barking nearby
morgan whats happening
graham puts bo on the ground and moves right in front of morgan
the ten year old boy looks deep in thought
graham takes hold of morgans chin and turns his face so hes looking straight at him
morgans eyes reveal hes come to some answer
i think god did it
the dogs keep barking
did what morgan
morgan takes hold of his fathers unshaven chin and turns his face
graham is forced to look to his right
graham sees something
graham hess slowly rises to his feet
he starts moving forward towards something
he walks through a thin layer of crops and emerges in a clearing
two german shepherds are running back and forth
they are clearly agitated
graham looks around at the thousands of corn stalks lying graham hess looks around in a daze as he walks out into the center
merrill bo and morgan follow him
the dogs keep running and barking as we pull back and reveal graham holds his hand over the barbecue to see if its at the right temperature
the other hand holds a cordless phone to his ear
into phone lee actually the reason im calling is about lionel
graham stokes the coals with a long barbecue fork
into phone was he at home last night with you or was he out and about with the wolfington brothers
graham moves around from behind the barbecue and heads towards the house
into phone well there was a little mischief done to our crops last night
into phone i know hes a fine boy
no ones saying otherwise
graham steps through the back screen door into his graham holds the phone a little closer and talks in a hushed into phone listen lee i dont even mind if
it was him
you could just talk to him and that would be enough for me
see it was kind of strange finding the crops like that
the kids were
confused by it
it would take the strangeness away if we knew it was lionel and the wolfington brothers just messing around
beat listens the movies
beat are you sure
beat okay then
thank you for your patience lee
graham turns off the phone
he turns to put it on the counter and realizes his children are seated on the kitchen floor with one of their two german shepherds
there is a large puddle on the kitchen tiles
i think hes sick
graham looks at the majestic dog
take him outside
ill call dr
morgan and bo lead their dog out with worried expressions on their faces
graham grabs a handful of paper towels and places it on the puddle of urine
the doorbell rings with graham still on his knees on the kitchen floor
he leans back so he can see down the hall
a balding police officer stands on the other side of the screen door
that was quick edgar
i only called you boys about two hours ago
officer edgar paski nods that he knows
kindleman twisted her ankle as she put it diving for her life when a bunch of school kids rode down the sidewalk on skateboards
she went down to thortons store this morning and started spitting on the new skateboards
by the time i got there mrs
kindleman had sprayed the whole damn place
she must have had a cold or something
it was enough to turn a grown mans stomach
graham stares at officer paski
so what happened to your crops
bo walks from the house with a large glass of water
she moves to houdini who sits in the shade by the picnic table
morgan pokes the barbecue fork into two meat patties on the grill
he places two pieces of cheese on the hamburgers before walking over to houdini
the two children sit down in the grass with the dog
bo is about to pour the glass of water into the dog bowl
takes a tiny sip of the water first
she holds the glass out to morgan
i think its contaminated
you dont even know what that word means
its not contaminated
its just tap water
pour it in his bowl
it tastes funny
he licks his butt everyday
hes not going to mind
bo shrugs and pours it into the bowl
houdini just sits staring at them
he is not shivering
he doesnt drink
he is unnaturally still
bo pushes the bowl closer
the children turn white
houdini begins to growl
bo stands up
bo dont run
houdini crouches down
whats wrong boy
stop it houdini
the german shepherd trembles
his body tightens
hes about to leap
soft bo run
officer edgar paski stands facing graham fifty feet away
they are on opposite ends of the crop circle
the crops all around them sway as the wind blows
officer paski yells over the wind
yelling its the strangest thing father
yelling dont call me father
yelling whats that
yelling dont call me father
its just graham now
they stands in awkward silence fifty feet away from each other
yelling you said something was strange
yelling the footprints
yelling what about them
yelling there are none
officer paskis knee touches the ground
he points to a single stalk of corn laying flat on its side
soft look at where its bent over
graham stands next to him and leans in
the joint where the stalk bends from the ground is a perfect l
its not broken
what kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it
graham looks around at the hundreds of thousands of corn stalks bent over each other in a perfect wave
softy cant be by hand
its too perfect
doesnt sound much like lionel prichard and the wolfington brothers
they cant take a piss without wetting the front of their pants
graham nods in agreement
officer paski stands up
second thing this week i cant explain
what was the first thing
some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior
sometimes violent behavior
theo henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow
sounds like a virus
no father theyre edgy
like they act when they smell a predator around
peeing on themselves and everything
we see a thought catch in grahams eyes
he turns back and stares in the direction of the house
you can barely see the roof over the crops
preoccupied edgar please dont call me father
the two men stand as the wind blows lightly around them
officer paski notices the still expression on grahams face
i dont hear my children
morgan watches the thin line of smoke rising from the charred patties on the grill next to the overturned picnic table
morgans attention moves as the crops part and his father and officer paski enter the backyard
they stop cold when they look in his direction
they begin a slow walk towards him
morgan hess is seated under the jungle gym with houdini on his lap
morgan is petting houdinis fur gently
bo is on top of the jungle gym curled up in a ball
as graham and officer paski get closer they see morgan is crying
then they see the dog is laying on it side and has a barbecue beat
they stare at morgan as he slowly pulls an inhaler from his pocket and brings it to his mouth
he inhales the asthma spray
he lowers the inhaler so he can speak
soft he wanted to kill bo
graham stares at his ten year old son
did he hurt you
morgan nods no
his tough exterior breaks as his face starts to tremble
he starts crying
graham picks him up in his arms
whispers in his ear im so sorry morgan
graham reaches up for bo
she has dirt and tears on her face
she slowly climbs down
graham carries both his children as they cry in his arms
he starts towards the house
merrill walks out from the back holding a bowl of food
i used a little tabasco in the potato salad
merrill sees houdini lying under the jungle gym
please tie up isabelle to the back of the shed
make sure the knots tight
merrill stands still with potato salad in his hands
the children watch over their fathers shoulder as merrill runs to their other german shepherd sitting quietly near the house and leads her by her collar across the yard to
graham reaches the porch of his house and opens the screen door
the last thing the children see as they enter the house is the image of officer paski pulling the barbecue fork out of their dead dogs neck
graham lies in bed
he rests his cheek against the pillow as he lies by himself
theyre tough cookies those two
they think houdinis playing with you up there
beat at least it got them to sleep
graham stares off
he smiles a little
okay miss puzzle master
i got one for you
what can make geometric shapes the size of a football field
and what would scare every animal in this county
beat have you figured it out yet
smiles you probably have
beat give me a hint colleen
is it bigger than a bread box
the large hess farm house sits in the moonlight
graham opens his eyes slowly as he stirs from his sleep
his daughter bo stares at him from the edge of the bed
she is five inches away from his face
graham gets startled
whats the matter
i saw a monster
can i have a glass of water
whats wrong with the water next to your bed
it tastes old
graham slowly gets up from the bed
he takes his daughters hand and starts out of the room
whats the rule about getting up in the middle of the night
only for pee or poop
graham leads his four year old daughter down the darkened hall
morgans body is half off his bed
graham gently lifts him back onto the pillow and covers him up
there are two glasses of water on bos bedside table
graham moves to bos bed
he sits on the edge of it
she stares back at him as she holds her panda
soft what are you thinking about
soft why do you talk to mom when youre by yourself
soft it makes me feel better
soft does she ever answer back
soft she doesnt answer me either
they both sit quietly for a moment
grahams eyes drift to the bedroom window
a large graham stands
he looks to his daughter with startled eyes
soft get under a blanket
they cant get you under the blankets
grey snow fills the screen
merrill sleeps in front of the family room television
a hand gently shakes him
merrill wakes and looks up at his brother zipping up his overcoat
merrill quickly puts on his boots at the front door
okay this guy is trying to scare us
hes messed with our property hes coming around the house
its time for an ass whoopin
this is not an intelligent way to approach this
merrill opens the front door
its pitch black outside
merrill turn to graham and gestures with his fingers
whispering we both go outside and move around the house in opposite directions
we act crazy insane with anger
make him crap in his pants and force him around till we meet up on the other side
merrill brings his fingers together at the end of a circle
whispering explain act crazy
whispering curse and stuff
whispering im not going to curse
whispering you dont mean it
its just for show
whispering it doesnt sound natural when i curse
whispering just make noises then
whispering explain noises
whispering are you going to do this or what
whispering no im not
whispering you want him coming in the house next time
they hear movement outside
merrill and graham look out into the darkness
hushed tone on the count of three
merrill and graham go out the front door in opposite directions
merrill is in a full sprint
he hugs the side of the building as he runs
were gonna beat your ass bitch
graham runs through the darkness around the first corner of the house
he waves his arms
im insane with anger
graham spots a large figure darting around the corner ahead of him
ive lost my mind
its time for an ass whoopin
merrill turns a corner full speed
the large figure has come im gonna tear your head off
we just make out movement in the darkness graham and merrill come screaming around two corners and come to a stop facing each other
they look around panting heavily
grahams eyes drift above them
hes on the roof
they follow the roof around the corner
they find themselves in the backyard
their eyes catch movement away from the house
they just catch a glimpse of the large figure as he disappears into the crops
the swing on the swing set is still moving from being hit
they stare across the yard silently
all we hear is their it was very dark
yes it was
officer edgar paski stands on the porch with his note pad open
he faces graham and merrill
you cant describe him at all
dont you think thats find of odd
it does seem kind of odd doesnt it
i dont know whether to look for a midget or a he definitely wasnt a midget
beat so he was tall
to merrill i would say so
over six feet
it was very dark
yes it was
weve established that
beat just tell me about his clothing then
graham and merrill stare at edgar paski
was he wearing a scottish kilt or jeans
they keep staring
edgar closes his pad
let me ask you two something
dont be embarrassed by the answer
it is possible
just possible now you might have been chasing each other around
you said you went in opposite directions
edgar it sounds as strange to me saying it as it is to you hearing it
but we couldnt see him
he stayed mostly in the shadows
all we could make out was movement
beat but ill tell you something with absolute certainty
there was someone watching our house last night
he was looking in my childrens windows and i want you to find him edgar
beat i need you to take this seriously just incase it is something serious
the three men stand in the doorway
edgar opens his pad
morgan walks up to the front door
he holds up a baby monitor
can i use bos old baby monitor as a walkie talkie
it needs batteries
edgar come inside
the three men follow morgan into the house
they pass through the family room where bo stands at the television
she is staring at the screen
on the screen is aerial bo changes the channel
she finds a cartoon
she sits down on the sofa
morgan and the men cant see the screen and move into the how certain are you that this was a male
i dont know any girls can run like that
graham opens one of the cabinets and pulls down some batteries
he hands them to morgan
these are ds i need double as
i have some upstairs
graham starts out of the kitchen
i dont know merrill
ive seen some of those women on the olympics
they could out run me easy
they all move into the bo watches cartoons
the cartoon music and cartoon prat this guy got on the roof in like a second
bo can you turn down the volume until officer paski leaves
bo nods and moves to the television
the pack of men follow graham up the that roof is over ten feet high
hes telling you the truth edgar
whoever it was is very strong and can jump pretty high
they arrive on the landing and follow graham into his bedroom
he moves into his they all move in with him
they got womens high jumping in the olympics
they got these scandinavian women who could jump clean over me
graham takes the clock radio from the sink
tries to open the back
shoot it needs a screw driver
i have double as in here
graham waves the radio
the men and morgan move out of the bathroom
i know youre making a point edgar
i just dont know what it is
they moves down the stairs
yesterday afternoon an out of town woman stopped by the diner and started yelling and cussing cause they didnt have her favorite cigarettes at the vending machine
scared a couple of customers
no ones seen her since
my point is we dont know anything about the person you saw
we should just keep all possibilities available
they move through the family room
bos cartoon is replaced by a special report news icon
dad wheres the remote
bo starts looking around the couch
graham stops before entering the kitchen
the group stops with him
he looks at bo searching the couch
he walks over to the television
there are three glasses of water on the tv set
he stands next to the set
doesnt see whats on the screen
bo youre too old to still be doing this
the rule is you take a glass of water you finish it
beat now whats wrong with this one
bo stops looking through the sofa cushions and looks to her father
looks at the glass
theres dust in it
morgan took a sip
it has his amoebas in it
bo turns back to her search
graham tucks the clock radio under his arm and collects the three glasses
he heads towards the kitchen
excluding the possibility that a female scandinavian olympian was running around outside our house last night what else is a possibility
im not done asking questions and i dont appreciate the sarcasm
they follow graham and morgan through the swinging door into the kitchen
graham puts the glasses in the sink with a group of other half filled water glasses and opens the drawer to pull out a screwdriver
he starts opening the clock radio
do you have anyone who might have a grudge or something against you
maybe a church member who might not have liked the fact that you left the church
graham looks at edgar
i dont think so
do you owe anybody money
you can tell me off the record if you need too
morgan hands graham the baby monitor and graham starts replacing the batteries
is anything missing
graham hands morgan the monitor
he turns it on
there is a its still making the noises
its old morgan
morgan heads out of the kitchen
listen i was out of line with that whole female scandinavian olympian thing
its just that im pretty strong and pretty fast
and i was running as fast as i could
and this guy
embarrassed smile he was just toying with us
merrill walks out of the kitchen
graham watches edgar think it over
graham moves to a windowsill where more glasses of water sit
he picks them up
sees two more on the coffee table
he gives up and puts the two glasses back on the windowsill
could everyone just take a seat on the couch
i have some preliminary thoughts
morgan sits with his monitor next to bo who quietly watches the tv
merrill and graham squeeze in next to morgan
there are three possibilities here
well call them one two and three
the level one scenario is that there is a sane individual who for real reasons wants to do you harm
i really dont believe thats what were looking at here
in my opinion whoever this is they dont want to do harm to you all
thats kind of clear
beat the level two scenario is this is a mentally unstable person whos fixated on you and your family
this is a possibility but a very slim one
beat i assure you i will treat all three possibilities carefully but in all likely hood we are looking at what well call a level three scenario
hes a watcher
someone who this is a game for
hes laying low
doesnt want to be seen
but he wants to watch you
study you folks
officer paski walks towards the windows
graham merrill and morgan follow him with their eyes
officer paski walks next to the television
officer paski turns to them
graham merrill and morgan stare at the screen
now i dont want you all to worry about this no more
youre making more of this than it is
beat you guys have had a tough couple of days with the vandalism to the crops and the death of your shepherd
beat maybe you guys should do something fun
let me worry about this person
let me find out who it is and then what the hell are you people looking at
edgar comes around to see the screen
ill be damned
turn up the volume bo
bo gets up
i cant find the remote
she presses the up arrows on the tv controls
images were shot yesterday afternoon by a thirty four year old local camera man in kerala a southern city of india
it is the eighteenth reported crop circle found in that country in the last seventy two hours
the television report cuts to columbia university professor
crop circles first emerged in the late seventies with the renewed interest in extraterrestrial life
they died out by the early eighties dismissed as hoaxes
this new resurgence is wholly different
elements of it are unexplainable
the speed and the quantity in which it has appeared implies the coordination of hundreds of individuals over many countries
beat there is only a limited amount of explanations
either this is one of the most elaborate hoaxes ever created or basically
beat its for real
morgan takes the asthma inhaler from his pocket and breathes in deeply
what in gods name is going on
the room goes silent as everyone watches the images on the television screen
the two men walk down the driveway to edgars patrol car
dont ask me what i think
cause i cant think straight right now
im going back to the station
have a cup of marcias coffee and try to think clear
after that i might make some calls
people got way too much time on their hands
edgar turns back to graham
but ill tell you something what i said in their still goes
you and your family have been through a lot in the last two days
not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago
edgar stares at graham
and three weeks
its left its mark still
the last thing these children need to do is worry about some crazy things happening in the world
take them into town
get their minds your mind on everyday things
its good medicine
its good advice
beat say hi to marcia for me
you take care of yourself
the hess family rides in their station wagon
merrill is shotgun
the children are in the back
morgan leans forward and turns on the radio
signs intended to be seen from the sky click
graham turns it off
no radio either
just for a while
morgan nods and then plops back into the backseat
downtown bucks county
a group of small stores along a quiet street
the hess station wagon pulls in front of a free parking meter
graham steps out the drivers side and looks around
merrill puts change in the meter
morgan walks up to graham with bo
morgan holds out his hand
graham gives his son a look as he reaches into his back pocket
morgan takes the money graham gives him then takes bos hand and walks down the sidewalk
graham watches them turn into a store
merrill steps onto the sidewalk
hands in his pockets as he walks away
graham turns and calls after him
calls out meet back in fifteen minutes
merrill waves over his shoulder
he keeps walking
graham starts across the street to the pharmacy
a mom and pop bookstore
three isles wide
nathan a couple in their early seventies sit behind their counter and watch a black and white tv
the picture on the morgan steps up to the counter
thats what they keep alluding to
its just a bunch of crock
theyre trying to sell sodas plain and simple
ive been watching these reports since morning
ive seen twelve soda commercials so far
do you have book on extraterrestrials
dont tell me you believe this horse manure
nathan pushes her husband aside
as a matter of fact i think we have one
came by mistake in a shipment
decided to keep it for city people
nathan points over to the far corner
third book from the left honey
graham waits at a white counter
a gum chewing pharmacist in her early twenties who looks like shes in her teens glances through back shelves of medicines as she listens to the radio
why is no one saying the obvious
this is just a rash case of copycats
someone somewhere does the first one
its on tv its on the internet
in less than an hour a couple hundred people get the same brilliant idea and here we are
on the verge of mass hysteria
it was asthma medicine right father
for morgan hess
and its not father anymore
the pharmacist looks back at graham and then reaches up and turns off the radio
she quietly finds the prescription on the shelf and moves to the counter across from graham
she doesnt ring it up
she just stands there fiddling with the bag holding morgans medicine
can i ask you a favor father
graham stares at the girl
he nods yes
can i take confession with you
graham leans forward on the counter and takes the girls hands in his
he talks very slowly
tracey i am not a reverend anymore
i havent been for six months
you know this
when tracey speaks her voice is a bit shaky
all this stuff on tv
beat joe gills was in here talking about the end of the world
im just a little scared
i need to take confession with you
graham looks at the young girls teary eyes
he exhales slowly
merrill stares up at a poster with a muscular guy in an army uniform standing at attention on a beach
we are in a narrow army recruiting center
inside the small storefront space is a desk
a gentleman sporting a crewcut sits behind it
a young man merrills age sits at a side card table filling out some forms
i got it figured
merrill realizes the crewcut guy is talking to him
ive had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights
cant tell what they look like cause theyre staying in the shadows covert like
no ones got hurt mind you
and thats the give away
doesnt see i see
its called probing
its a military procedure
you send a reconnaissance group very small to check out things
not to engage but to evaluate the situation
evaluate the level of danger
make sure things are all clear
clear for what
the crewcut guy savors the beat of silence
for the rest of them
it takes a second but merrill smiles
the crewcut guy smiles back
merrill points at a poster
you have a pamphlet or something i can read
the crewcut guy reaches to a stack of brochures
picks the top brochure and hands it to merrill
the crewcut guy begins to stare at merrill closely
hey you didnt used to play baseball did you
merrill looks up from the brochure
i know you
youre merrill hess
i was there that day you hit that five hundred and eighty seven footer over the left field wall and set the record
that thing had a motor on it
its still the record right
merrill not yes
soft i got the bat at home
on the wall
you got two minor league home run records dont you
the five longest
boy why arent you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting handfuls of t and a
cause he also has the minor league strike out record
merrill turns to the young man about his age who sits at the folding table
hed just swing as hard as he could every time
it didnt matter what the coach said didnt matter who was on base hed whip that bat through the air as hard as he could
looked like a lumber jack chopping down a tree
beat merrill here struck out more times than any two players
you really hold the strike out record
merrill tucks the pamphlet in his jacket
looks like hes not going to say anything
when he does the words are soft and worn theyve been said a hundred times
felt wrong not to swing
the crewcut guy shakes his head
merrill turns and starts walking
as he passes lionel merrill makes a small quick move in lionels direction like he might hit him
lionel flinches and covers his face
merrill walks out the door of the army recruiting office
i cursed thirty seven times last week
i said the f word a couple times but mostly shits and bastards
beat is douche bag a curse
graham glances at the girl as she sits sideways to him at the counter
i suppose its in its usage
how about john youre a douche bag for kissing barbara
thats a curse
then its not thirty seven
its seventy one
grahams eyes widen
i stole a bottle of ruby red lip stick from k mart
i punched my brother in the back three times
graham looks around the empty store for help
bo sits at a tiny reading table and drinks a glass of water
there is another glass half full on her table
nathan watches as the little girl takes careful sips
bo looks up with a grimace
carl theres something wrong with our water
morgan doesnt look up from the extraterrestrial book
your water is fine
bo has a thing about her drinking water
shes had it her whole life
like a tick people have
except its not a tick
fascinated is that right
she places the glass she sipped on the table with the other glass
nathan stares at the four year old
everyone turns to the front of the store where mr
nathan points to the tv screen
a coke cola commercial is on
nathan turns back to find morgan holding out the extraterrestrial book to her
ill take it
merrill morgan and bo are waiting in the parked car
the drivers side opens and graham sits in
i dont want any one of you spending time with tracey abernathy alone
is that understood
everyone nods yes
graham puts the key in the ignition and turns the car on
merrill watches as grahams hand goes to put the car in reverse and then stops
graham is staring out the windshield
merrill follows his stare to a thin thirty year old man in a leather jacket coming out of a store
merrills face changes expression too
they both stare as the man passes in front of the car
soft is that him
everyone in the car watches the man in the leather jacket as he steps off the sidewalk towards the truck
its here that he notices the stares
he glances up to see the faces watching him from the station wagon
the leather jacketed man keeps moving to his truck
he gets in turns it on and without looking over to the station wagon backs out of the parking lot
the hess family sits quietly
who is he
nobody says anything for the longest time
hes the man who killed mom
graham puts the station wagon in reverse and backs out into the street
the sky is golden red
the crops sway hypnotically in a gentle breeze
the hess station wagon pulls into their driveway
it comes to a stop in front of the house
the engine goes off
no one gets out
all four sit quietly not getting out
graham and merrill turn and see morgan pull the baby monitor out of his jacket
he holds it in his lap
what if bos baby monitor is picking up signals from the extraterrestrials
all this crop stuff
they did it twenty five years ago
it was a joke
its just static morgan
turn it up and see
morgan turns a knob on the side
its a code
let me see that please
morgan hands graham the monitor in the front seat
the beeps its noise
its broken morgan
itll just keep doing this
beat lets get out of the car okay
we might lose the signal
we cant just sit in the car in our own driveway like this
well look like mental patients
nobody gets out of the station wagon
im getting out now
dont do it
graham pulls the handle
his door opens
he waits before getting out
the other three station wagon doors open right after
graham stands and closes his driver side door
everyone becomes frozen standing next to the station wagon
three of the doors are open
did you hear that
everyone stares at the baby monitor in grahams hand
not english though
you heard the voices right uncle merrill
i heard them morgan
graham doesnt move his arm
he keeps it out in the air where he had it as he closed his door
graham looks to merrill over the roof of the station wagon
its probably picking up another baby monitor
let me see it
he hands the monitor over the hood
merrill reaches for it
graham and merrill freeze both touching the monitor over the roof of the station wagon
it doesnt sound like words
merrill concentrates on the swirling moving texture coming graham looks around at his rapt family
see this is why were not watching those news reports
people get obsessed
beat im letting go now
dont do it
youll lose the signal
graham looks at merrill whos now one of them
morgan is the first one to move
dont let go
he moves from the back passenger door to the back bumper where he begins to climb onto the station wagon
it gets clearer the higher you hold it
morgan crawls on the roof and takes the monitor ever so gently out of graham and merrills outstretched hands
morgan be careful
i got him
merrill climbs up over the side and joins morgan on the roof
merrill keeps a hand on his nephew
morgan raises the monitor above his head
bo runs to the front bumper and climbs onto the hood
graham cuts her off by taking a seat on the hood
he takes hold of bo
all four are on the car now
morgan stands up on the roof of the station wagon
merrill holds him by the waist
bo tries to get up onto the roof by climbing over graham and the windshield
graham boosts her up over his head with both hands
merrill you got her
merrill reaches out his free hand
bo reaches out to him
everyone stops exactly where they are
graham holds bo over his head
bo reaches out to merrill
merrill sits on the roof with one arm out
morgan stands with the baby monitor raised high in the air
the hess family remains very still on the hood of their station wagon as they listen
soft theres two of them talking
graham struggles to hold bo up
bo struggles to keep her arms out
merrill struggles not to turn his face to the incredible sounds above his head
morgans eyes widen as the sequence of sounds becomes shorter beat
everyone looks up at the baby monitor
the red lights are off
only the bland hum of normal static comes from its beat
soft they hung up
graham brings bo down into his lap
morgan takes a seat next to merrill on the roof
the hess family sits like mental patients on the top of their station wagon
the lights are on in the kitchen
we see graham merrill and the children doing dishes after dinner
the dog is barking furiously
isabelle the remaining german shepherd is tied to a post outside the barn
the dog whips back and forth frantically
she keeps looking in our direction
graham steps out the back screen door with a bowl of dog food and a bowl of water
we watch him as he walks towards the frantic dog
when he gets close graham slows
he approaches the dog carefully
he places the two bowls close but not too close
the dog has no interest in them
she keeps barking and glaring in our direction
graham watches her for a few moments and then turns and graham stands frozen looking across his yard
isabelle the dog turns in desperate circles behind him
grahams eyes stay focused on the same point in the darkness
he talks to no one
you know something
even entertaining the possibility of this for a minute has been exciting
graham starts to move
i can see how people can get carried away with this type of thing
graham reaches the barbecue area
theres a flashlight on the picnic table
graham turns the flashlight on
a narrow graham starts toward the crops
its a kind of faith
its an intoxicating thing to believe in something you cant see
graham steps right up to them
he hesitates and then steps into the field of we cant see two feet in any direction
six foot stalks of corn line graham on all sides
the flashlight throws a you were always good at that
the beam of his flashlight finds a narrow path
graham starts following it
his shoulders brush crops on either side
believing in things you couldnt see
beat you would have been the first person on that station wagon wouldnt you
you and morgan would have been wrestling for that baby monitor
he shines his light down the path
nothing but crops disappearing into darkness
itll be secretly kind of sad for everybody when this turns out to be all just make believe
theres movement right next to him
graham spins and aims the flashlight at the crops to his right
the light only yelling youre wasting your time here
im not going to report this or anything you do to me crops to the news or tv or anybody
youre not going to get famous
there is no response
graham can hear his own beat
graham holds his breath
the sound of someone else graham turns and drops the flashlight at the same time
the graham kneels down and gropes in the darkness
his hands search over the ground in all directions
they finally touch the flashlight
graham quickly fumbles with it to find the on button
it instantly moves into the darkness
graham tries to get up
he stumbles backwards into the crops
hes tangled in crops as he struggles to rise
he gets up and starts running
leaves and stalks slap him from all directions
he doesnt know where he is
there is something coming graham makes a sudden right turn
he puts his hands in front of him to protect his face and eyes
hes running as fast as he can
he hears stalks of corn breaking behind him
another sudden turn this time left
graham emerges into his graham keeps running across the yard
isabelle barks when graham reaches the porch stairs he stops and turns
there is no one behind him
the wall of crops fifty feet away sway in the gentle night breeze
graham gains control of his breathing
he turns and walks to the screen door slowing his breathing down with each step
graham steps into the kitchen
his hair is messed
his shirt has a few leaves from corn stalks stuck to it
he locks the back door
the children dont notice his presence
theyre splashing each other at the sink as they clean the dinner dishes
graham looks through the kitchen doorway to the family room
he sees merrill there
merrills hands are in his pockets as he stares at the wooden baseball bat mounted above the fireplace
merrill doesnt notice him either
graham takes two steps to the kitchen table and slowly takes a seat
his breathing is a slow controlled pant
he runs one shaky hand through his hair as he gathers himself and thinks
his kind eyes stare down at the ground as he slows his mind
merrill is the first to notice him
he moves from where the baseball bat is hung into the kitchen
as he passes the children at the sink he turns off the faucet
the children stop playing and look up to merrill
they follow his stare to the kitchen table
graham looks up at them
beat lets turn on the tv
first appeared fifty two minutes ago
bo puts her finger to the screen and counts the hovering lights
morgan merrill and graham stand silently before the television set
mexico city officials as well as u
officials have confirmed that these are not air crafts from either governments airforce
the first sighting was made by an air mexico en route from mazatlan to new york as the unidentified crafts entered mexico city air space
they were not detected by radar by either country
the crazies were right
everyone just watches the fourteen lights hovering on the screen
we have to tape this
morgan reaches into the pile of video tapes under the television stand
he grabs one
bo snatches the video as morgan tries to put it into the vcr
my ballet recital
morgan stares at his sister
gravely serious listen bo
this is very important
everything people have written about in science books is going to change
the history of the worlds future is on the tv right now
we need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there
beat for your children bo
my ballet recital
graham doesnt take his eyes off the screen
preoccupied find another tape
graham and merrill sit down at the same time on the sofa
they both have the same dazed slow movements
morgan rummages through the pile of videos frantically
he finds one and reaches for the vcr
uncle merrill im using your tape
morgan slams the tape marked bay watch into the vcr and presses record
hes breathing heavy now
morgan moves to the sofa and takes a seat in between his father and his uncle
bo walks over and squeezes in also
the four of them stare at the television
youre seeing a live feed from our nbc affiliate down in mexico city
the time there is pm
this image has not been adjusted or enhanced in any way
what youre seeing is real
beat everything they wrote in science books is about to change
soft told you
morgan brings his asthma spray to his mouth and inhales
the family room lights are off now
the tv is still on
the sound is muted
there are a couple glasses of bos water on the television now
the fourteen lights are still hovering on the screen
morgan is asleep on grahams lap
bo is asleep on merrills shoulder
whispers some people are probably thinking this is the end of the world
graham turns his sleepy eyes away from the screen to merrill
whispers thats true
merrill looks his brother in the eyes
whispers do you think its a possibility
whispers how can you say that
whispers that wasnt the answer you wanted
whispers can you at least pretend to be like you used to be
give me some comfort
graham thinks it over
whispers there are all different ways you can tell that theres someone really there watching out for us
you see signs
sometimes theyre little ones
you think of someone
the phone rings
theyre on the phone
sometimes theyre big like fourteen lights hovering over mexico city
beat sure there are a lot of people watching this who think this could be a bad thing
but there are a lot of people watching this who think its a miracle
a sign of gods existence
its all in how you look at things merrill
beat what you have to decide is what kind of person you are
are you the type who believes in miracles and looks for signs or are you the kind who believes things just happen by chance
merrill is deep in thought
i was at this party once
im on a couch with sara mckinney
she was just sitting there looking beautiful and staring at me
i go to lean in and kiss her and i realize i have gum in my mouth
i turn and take out the gum
stuff it in my paper cup next to the sofa and turn around
sara mckinney throws up all over herself
beat i knew the second it happened
it was a miracle
i could have been kissing her when she threw up
that would have scarred me for life
i may never have recovered
merrill looks at the tv screen
im a miracle man
those lights are a miracle
whispers there you go
whispers so which type are you
whispers do you feel comforted
whispers what does it matter then
the two of them turn back to the silent screen of the television
its a long beat before graham speaks
whispers do you know what colleens last words were before they killed her
merrill turns and stares quietly at his brother
whispers she said see and then her eyes glazed a bit and she said
tell merrill to swing away
merrills mouth opens a bit
graham turns and chuckles at his expression
whispers do you know why she said that
merrill nods no
whispers because the nerve endings in her brain were firing as she died and some random memory of us at one of your baseball games popped into her head
beat there is no one watching out for us merrill
were all on our own
graham turns back to the television
grahams eyes open
daylight fills the family room
he is alone on the couch
alone in the room
he looks to the television
its not there
graham moves to his feet and look around the room
his eyes stop on an extension cord that runs from a wall outlet in the family room across the front hall and under a closet door
graham moves to the door
we hear muffled television voices
graham opens the merrill looks up
hes seated on a kitchen chair with the television on a roll away stand crammed in with him
for the kids protection
all they were doing was watching tv from five a
i felt like they were getting obsessed like you said
they should be playing furry furry rabbit or tea party or something right
whats furry furry rabbit
points thats a game isnt it
points at the tv theres been some interesting developments
what time is it
graham looks at the tv screen
theres a daylight shot of mexico city
the skies are empty above it
but theyre not really gone
we just cant see them
early this morning a bird flew right at the area where the lights were hovering last night
merrill puts a finger in the sky on the screen
it stopped dead in the air and fell straight down
merrills finger trails to the bottom of the screen
they caught it on tape and theyve been playing it all morning
they found the bird
his head crushed in
when you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky
beat they think they have some invisible shield thing going like an optical illusion
the bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell
already thought of
two other birds did the same thing an hour later
not as dramatic
but you could see they hit something
graham looks at the empty sky on the screen with different eyes
theyre still there hovering
in fact some people think theres more of them now
all over the place
over us even
beat and theres a theory about the crop circles now
they think it could be some kind of landmark visual mapping system so they can navigate
makes sense doesnt it
we are inside grahams bedroom facing his bathroom door which is closed
the same sun faded outline of where a large cross used to hang is stained on the wall next to the door
graham opens the bathroom door and steps out with wet hair
he towels it dry as he moves to his bedroom window
the backyard is large and green with a wooden jungle gym
a single tree throws shade onto a picnic table
the back of the yard is lined by corn crops
golden and brown
six feet high
the crops go on well beyond our view
graham stares at them quietly
the sound of whispering draws his attention from the he listens closely
his children are whispering in the next graham walks into the hall and looks in their room
morgan and bo are seated on the edge of their bed
they have tin foil wrapped around their heads like a helmet
graham stares at his children
so the aliens cant read our minds
they tell you everything in this book
morgan holds up the book he bought from nathans bookstore
graham enters the room
the children make space for him on the bed
he takes a seat between them
morgan puts the book on his fathers lap
it says theyre probably very small like my height because as their brains developed there was no use for physical development
it says theyre probably vegetarians because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet
who wrote this book
graham looks on the back cover for a picture
theres none there
scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs
that means theyre unemployed
morgan closes the book
dad are you going to be serious
bo points at the book
graham looks at his two children with foil on their heads
i dont know what got into me
morgan puts the book on his fathers lap
there are pictures
morgan opens the tome
bimboo one of the authors of the book bimboo
i just asked his name
you had a tone
graham acknowledges with a nod that he did have a tone
he says there are two reasons why extraterrestrials would visit us
morgan turns the page
to make contact in the spirit of exploration and furthering the knowledge of the universe
graham looks at an illustration of a small bulbous headed figure shaking hands with a bearded human
or the other reason
theyve used up the resources on their planet and are looking to harvest our planet next
morgan turns the page
there is a picture of a house
a space ship is hovering over the home shooting laser beams at it
looks a little like our house doesnt it
morgan and bo lean in closer to look at the picture
the same windows
soft thats weird
the three of them study the picture of the house
its on fire
their eyes move to the front yard
there are three bodies lying dead on the front lawn
two are children
the children scream and cling to their father
their screams die down
the phone rings again
graham gets up
he closes the book
thats enough from dr
bimboo for now
everybody in this house needs to calm down and eat some fruit or something
graham steps out into the hallway
he tucks the book under his arm and picks up the phone
against the floor and then the phone disconnects
nothing but dead air
graham looks at the receiver and then slowly hangs it up
graham walks down the hall to a small window
the window looks down the driveway and out onto the road
graham stares into the distance
about a half mile away we see the tip of a house
graham gazes at it for a beat
graham comes down the stairs with his overcoat on
he moves to the closet door and knocks on it before opening it
merrill looks up from the television
im going out for a few minutes
no one leaves this house
where are you going
ray reddys house
graham starts down the hall
merrill steps out of the closet for the first time
he looks down the hall shocked
graham unlocks the front door
i think he just called here
you dont think something bad will happen do you morgan
morgan pulls his eye away from the telescope that is set up on the window seat in his room
why you got one of your feeling again
bo nods yes
is it bad
bo nods yes slowly
if it does i wont let anything bad happen to you
bo hugs morgan tight
soft i dont want you to die
who said i was going to die
bo keeps hugging morgan
who said i was going to die
morgan peels bos arms off of him
come on bo
i need to keep a look out
bo lets go
morgan puts his eye to the eyepiece of the telescope
a mailbox reads r
there is a gray and white house at the end of the quarter mile driveway
we saw the roof of this house from the hess hallway window
graham stands at the front door and rings the doorbell again
graham tries to look inside
curtains block his view
graham walks around the porch
turns the corner of the house
he looks in a side window
graham stands straight up
he looks around nervously
he takes two steps back towards the front of the house and the safety of his station wagon before he notices the green truck parked to the side of the
there is someone sitting in it
the passenger side window of the truck is open
graham steps up to it and looks inside
the thin man with the leather jacket we saw in town sits behind the wheel
he stares out the windshield
he is covered in sweat
ray reddy doesnt look over
ray clutches the steering wheel tightly turning his knuckles a yellow white
graham glances to the backseat of the truck
there are two large bags over flowing with clothes
grahams eyes gently move back to ray and drift down to the two blood stained area on his shirt
what happened ray
ray doesnt look over when he speaks
i wrote your number down to call you
its been sitting next to the phone for six months
when i knew it was inside the house i couldnt think of any other number to call
beat thank you for coming father
soft youre welcome ray
tears start falling down rays face
i worked so long that night
i aint never fallen asleep driving before
and never since
most of the ride home there wasnt a car insight in either direction
if id fallen asleep then id a ended up in a ditch with a head ache
it had to happen at that right moment
that certain ten fifteen seconds when i passed her walking
it was like it was meant to be
ray finally turns
his red face quivers as he talks
i guess if this is the end of the world im screwed right
people who kill reverends wives arent exactly ushered to the front of the line in heaven
ray starts the car
where you going ray
to the lake
the way i see it all the places marked in the crops and such none of them are really near water
i figure they dont like water
beat cant be any worse than here
ray did you see one of them
ray looks at graham
im truly sorry for what ive done to you and yours
the two men stare at each other for a beat
ray looks away
he puts the car in drive
and dont open my pantry father
i locked one of them in there
graham steps away as the truck moves forward and pulls down the driveway
merrills head is leaned against a bunch of winter coats
his eyes are closed
the startling footage were about to show you was photographed by a forty two year old romero valadares
merrills eyes open
this video was taken yesterday afternoon at his sons seventh birthday in the city of passo fundo brazil
it was sent to the local news bureau there and satellited to us a few minutes ago
all initial opinions are this is genuine
what you are about to see may disturb you
merrill sits up in his chair
the chair in the closet creaks as merrill leans forward a little towards the television screen
esta atras da garagem
esta atras de ai
merrill is frozen like a statue
his mouth is open a little
the closet fills with the pandemonia of the kitchen on the merrill hess stares stunned at the image of an upright animal the door swings open slowly
graham steps into ray reddys kitchen
cabinets are open
dishes are broken
chairs are turned over
the faucet is running full blast
grahams eyes move across the room
the kitchen table is upside down and leaned up against the pantry door
graham takes a few conservative steps to the middle of the kitchen
he leans a little bit and listens
from behind the pantry door we hear the sound of breathing
there are quiet graham can almost see the bottom of the door around the leaning table
graham stands up straight and thinks it over
graham takes two small steps closer
when he leans he can now see the entire bottom of the pantry door
there is light leaking out from beneath it
there is hello
loud the police are here
i am with them
i am a police officer
beat i just want to talk to you
there is no movement from the pantry
loud we know all about the hoax
we already took some of your friends downtown in the paddy wagon
mouths to himself paddy wagon
graham waits for a reply but none comes
if you tell us your name and why you did it well give you the same deal we gave the others
dont throw away your life son
graham bends down where he stands
he puts his head near the wood floor
he tries to look under the door
all he can see are the bottoms of a couple shelves in the corner of the pantry
hes at too severe an angle
graham sits up
hes only four feet away from the pantry door
he looks around not knowing what to do
his eyes fall on a bunch of kitchen knives that have spilled from a drawer onto the floor
he takes a butcher knife from the group and moves closer to the door
he reaches with the butcher knife underneath the slanted kitchen table
he uses the knife like a mirror to see under the door
graham watches the soft graham pulls the knife out
he sits there kneeling two feet from the door
he takes a deep breath and starts to lower his head under the slanted table
he stops halfway down
he loses his nerve and sits up
he rises to his feet as he places the butcher knife on the counter
graham starts walking across the kitchen
he gets to the door
puts his hand on the doorknob
he stays like that for a long time
graham lets go of the doorknob he turns and walks quickly across the kitchen he picks up the butcher knife he kneels down next to the pantry he ducks his
head under the slanted kitchen table he places his cheek to the floor only inches from the bottom of the door and looks into the pantry
there is broken glass and rice throughout the wooden floor of the pantry
graham stares at his view of the floor
parts of it feel like a painting
the painting moves
the station wagon knocks over the ray reddy mailbox as it turns sharply onto the road
graham picks up speed as he passes the wall of crops on his right
two black skid marks form on the road as the station wagon comes to a fast stop
graham gets out of the car
he walks a few feet ahead of the station wagon
he bends down in the middle of the road
a bird lays limp on the asphalt
its head is crushed
graham gazes at the still pile of feathers
graham turns and looks straight up at the blue cloudless sky above him
soft douche bag
graham enters his front hall
he closes the door and locks it behind him
he turns and looks into the family room
morgan and bo and merrill are seated together on the sofa
all three are wearing foil helmets
theyre skin changes color
thats why we couldnt see him that night
graham stares at his family huddled on the couch
graham takes in the news as he moves to the stairs
he takes a seat on the second to last step
he sits obscured by the balusters
tell me something morgan
in that book of your did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile
they would invade us using only ground tactics
hand to hand combat
they wouldnt use their technology or fight an airborne battle because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them
im sorry what book is this
did they say what our chances would be if they did invade
they said one of two things could happen
one they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full forces hundreds or even thousands of years later
the words hang in the air
graham sits quietly on the second step of the stairs
what do you think about the idea that they dont like places near water and we might be safe from them near a lake or something
sounds made up
we can choose to believe it and pack up and leave
beat or we can stay here
board up this house
hide inside our home and wait it out
either way at least well be together
beat all those in favor of the lake raise your hand
no one raises their hand
all those in favor of home raise your hand
all four put their hands in the air
they lower them and sit in silence
how do we know boards will do anything
soft because they seem to have trouble with pantry doors
we are watching the house from the crops
we see graham inside the house closing the window shutters in one room after another
we see a stack of wooden boards on the porch
our view moves to the barn where isabelle is tied
she is not pacing
she is not barking
she sits staring right at us
she is shivering
our view moves to the garage building where we see merrill carry a huge pile of his clothes and things down the stairs
hes moving into the main house
merrill walks across the yard
his eyes look around carefully as he moves
part of the pile in his arms falls to the grass as he crosses the lawn
he stops walking and starts to gather up the fallen things
he picks up a couple shirts and two baseballs encased in glass cases
the glass encasing one of the souvenir baseballs has cracked
he takes the ball out
stares at it
we watch from the crops as merrill puts down his pile of clothes and things on the grass
he looks around and finds what hes looking for
merrill unscrews the fork on the rake from the wooden handle
with the wooden stick in one hand and the souvenir baseball in the other he turns to face the crops
merrill looks around cautiously again before getting into a batters stance
his left leg digs into the grass in front of him
his weight is mostly on his back leg
he looks out into the distance high over the crops
he throws the baseball up in the air
merrill grabs the wooden handle
merrills shoulders move with blinding speed
the wooden rake handle slices the air
and misses the ball
the ball drops at merrills feet
we watch as merrill picks up the ball and tries again
this time his shoulders move even faster
the wooden stick actually makes a resonant sound as it cuts the air
the ball drops at merrills feet
we watch through the crops as merrill snatches the ball up and tries a third time
this time he yells as he swings
he rips the air with the wooden stick so fast it blurs to the eye
the baseball drops at his feet
merrill stands still in the yard
hes breathing a little heavy as he stares down at the ball
he gently picks it up
he walks back to his pile of things and then suddenly turns
he throws the ball in the air as he does
his left leg goes out
his weight goes to his right leg as he turns his shoulders with astonishing speed and power
the ball rockets into the air
we watch it fly overhead
sail high over the crops
it becomes a tiny dot in the sky
after a long beat of silence it comes back to earth
it lands in the street and bounces twenty feet into the air
it cleared at least four or five hundred feet of crops
we look back to merrill standing in the backyard
he drops the wooden stick to the grass and moves for his things
he piles them in his arms
when his arms are full he starts for the porch
we watch from the crops as merrill goes morgan and bo are seated on the kitchen chair in the closet
they appear almost at the same time in the doorway to the closet
graham and merrill are holding hammers
all four stare at the television
tel aviv joins nairobi lagos and jerusalem as the latest to confirm the appearance of lights
there are lights in the skies over an estimated two hundred and seventy four cities
that total could be as high as four hundred within the hour
they decided to show themselves
they think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver
its like war of the worlds
they think it might happen all at once
the words silence everyone
the image goes back to a quiet tv anchor
he takes a second before starting up again
hundreds of thousands have flocked to synagogues churches and temples
the television shows hundreds of israelis in a temple and in the streets praying
graham watches quietly as the masses pray side by side
ground forces are being assembled in countries throughout the globe
im going to get back to the windows
bo watches as graham leaves the doorway of the closet
she turns back to the television
merrill leans down between his niece and nephew
whispers you guys okay
they dont answer
they watch the soldiers loading up onto trucks on the television
some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world
beat nothing really bad is going to happen is it uncle merrill
morgan glances at bo and then back to his uncle
you sure right
merrill gazes at the two questioning faces
he looks back at the empty closet doorway where graham stood
he turns back to the children
you know about signs morgan
not like the ones people write on
its like if you poured a glass of milk and you dropped the glass by mistake and broke it before you could drink it
then you looked at the milk carton and saw that the milk was spoiled
theyre things that happen by chance or luck but make you feel that someones watching out for you
the children think it over
i once had a bad dream and i couldnt wake up
i kicked at the table next to my bed and something fell on me and i woke up
it was a picture of mom
she was smiling
it made me feel safe
you mean like that
yeah like that
beat i believe in signs morgan
i think theres someone watching out for us
i got to believe hes going to make sure were all right in the end
merrill smiles as he steps out of the closet and closes the door half way
he stands in the hall by himself
he takes a couple deep breaths as everything hits him
morgan turns off the television
he and bo sit quietly in the closet under the stairs
graham sits in a chair by the windows
he has a board on his lap
he has a hammer in his hands
graham drowns in his thoughts as the skies darken behind him
graham bo and morgan are seated in the upstairs hallway
theres a couple boards left leaning against the walls
merrill comes out of the childrens room with his tools
too many windows in the bedrooms
we dont have enough boards
merrill stands and leans against the wall
well have to board up the bedroom doors
where are we going to sleep
the family room
everyone sits quietly for a moment
what about isabelle
well keep her in the garage after dinner
ill make sandwiches
i want spaghetti
we should eat fast bo
spaghetti sounds great
merrill glances at graham
what do you want morgan
graham nods yes
and mashed potatoes
now were talking
beat how about you merrill
graham turns and looks at merrill
they stare at each other quietly
they have a conversation without words
soft chicken teriyaki
im going to have a cheeseburger with bacon
smiles extra bacon
the windows in the kitchen are boarded up as is the back door
the sink is piled with pots and pans
it seems like every utensil and dish in the kitchen was used
one side of the dinning room is lined with windows that have been boarded up
the table is set
mash potatoes spaghetti french toast chicken teriyaki and bacon cheeseburgers are all displayed elegantly on serving dishes
the hess family sits around the table
the scene is somber
no one is moving
whats the matter with everyone
no one says anything
no one eats
i dont want to hear anymore talk like that
and i dont want to see anymore faces like the ones im looking at
beat we are going to enjoy this meal
nothing can stop us from enjoying this meal
bo sits next to her three glasses of water and begins to cry
dont yell at her
morgans face is hard but tears start to fall anyway
graham watches as both his children cry at the table
fine if you all dont want to eat then im going to have some of everything
graham takes big scoops of every dish and piles it on his plate
he digs his fork into the pile and starts to shove it in his mouth
this tastes so great
bo morgan and merrill watch in stunned silence as graham stuffs more in his mouth
he chews and chews and swallows hard
he digs his fork into the pile again
graham starts crying as he eats
he keeps taking more bites
more tears fall
morgan gets up from his seat
he goes to grahams chair
he leans against his dads arm and cries with him
grahams fork stops moving
he watches as bo moves from her seat to his other side
she holds her dads arm and cries
graham pulls them both up onto the chair with him and hugs them tight
merrill leans forward and comes to the pile on grahams chair
merrill buries his head in grahams shoulder
the hess family huddles together at one end of the table
everyone slowly turns and looks over to morgans place setting where the baby monitor sits on the table
the red merrill sits up
graham puts down the children from his lap
he gets up from his seat and moves around the table and out of the dinning room
he moves through the family room and into the hall
graham opens the closet door and looks in at the television
he turns it on
the emergency broadcast symbol is on the screen
a low tone emits from the tv
graham changes stations
sound fills the closet
graham steps out into the hall
merrill and the two children are standing there waiting
graham looks at them
soft its happening
merrill pounds furiously with his hammer as he nails boards to the childrens bedroom door
the master bedroom door is open with a board leaning next to it
graham is inside his bedroom graham walks to the window next to his bed
its the same one weve looked out twice before
graham looks out onto his backyard
the flood light from the house throws long shadows over the yard
there is a light breeze
nothing seems wrong
grahams eyes stay locked on the crops which go on and on into darkness
he moves closer to the glass
watches the top of the corn stalks swaying slightly with the wind
grahams eyes moves to where the corn crops fade into black forty feet away
graham goes very still
graham backs away from the window towards the middle of his bedroom
graham turns to see merrill standing with the last board in the hall
graham moves out into the hall and shuts the bedroom door behind him
merrill immediately puts the wooden board up and starts hammering nails into the frame
graham picks up his hammer and quietly begins to hammer nails into the wood
graham glances to his right as he works
bo and morgan are standing together at the top of the stairs
bo holds morgans hand
graham keeps hammering as he speaks
did i ever tell you what everyone said when you were born bo
bo nods no lightly
you came out of your momma and you didnt even cry
you just opened your eyes and looked around at everybody
your eyes were so big and gorgeous the ladies in the room gasped
graham stops hammering
merrill keeps going
they literally gasped
graham gasps like them then they go shes like an angel
they said weve never seen a baby so beautiful
graham smiles to himself as he remembers the moment
merrill finishes hammering
graham goes over and picks up bo
soft and you know what else happened
bo nods no
soft when they put you on the table to clean you up you looked at me and smiled
they say babies that young cant smile
graham looks at his daughter quietly
he brushes the hair out of her face as merrill moves to morgan and picks him up
all four turn and look at the three boarded up bedroom doors
soft lets go down now
graham puts bo down in the hallway
she stands close to him
merrill puts down morgan
the four of them stand quietly in a tight group
we forgot about isabelle
whispers should we turn off the lights
soft they already know were here
almost inaudible dad do you know what happened when you were born morgan
morgan looks at his father unable to speak
you came out and your momma kept bleeding
the doctors rushed you out of the room before i could even see you
all four look up
theyre on the roof
while they were trying to fix her up all she kept asking about was you
merrill looks up the stairs at the boarded bedroom doors
theyre in the house
graham takes morgans hand
i wanted your momma to see you first
she had dreamed about you her whole life
beat they waited till she felt better then they brought you in
they placed you right in her arms
and she looked at you
and you looked at her
you just stared at each other for the longest time and then she said real soft hello morgan im you momma you look just like i dreamed
graham smiles down at his son who smiles gently back
the group of four turns and watches the top of the stairs
the bedroom door handles are being rattled
merrills eyes moves quietly above the bedroom doors to the ceiling of the upstairs hallway
he stares at a rectangle in the ceiling
a tiny rope hangs from the rectangle
the attic door
merrill sprints up the stairs
morgan and bo watch as graham follows after merrill
graham and merrill stare up at the ceiling
there is movement right above them
dust falls from a ceiling light right next to them
the rope hanging from the attic trapdoor hangs between them
they watch as it begins to twitch and sway
the springs in the trap door begins to groan
the door starts to fall open
merrill and graham raise their arms above their head and reach up
the door opens a few inches
merrill is taller
the door presses against his fingers first
it gives a few more inches before merrill stops it
grahams finger are barely touching it
merrills face turns red with strain as something pushes down on the door
this is a very temporary solution
graham brings his arms down
he sees his children watching from the bottom of the stairs
graham looks around where he is
there is a very small table with photos against a wall
a laundry closet and three boarded up bedroom doors
graham turns to merrill
merrills face is a deep crimson
twenty two seconds
graham looks around again
the same things
the same table
the same closet
graham stops and stares at the closet
it has a wooden folding door that opens and closed on a guide rail
the wooden folding door is very tall
its top is one foot from the ceiling
graham goes to the closet and grabs the door
he starts rocking it hard
pulling it out
it starts to come out of its guide rail
graham leans back with all his weight
the thin wooden door rips out of place
one end is still attached at the hinge
graham pulls it straight
it reaches into the middle of the landing
it stands right next to merrill
right under the attic trapdoor
its top is only a few inches lower than merrills reach
merrill hesitates and then lowers the attic trapdoor
it connects with the top of the closet door and stops
the trapdoor is now open almost a foot
we can now see part of the bottom step of the wooden pull out stairs that lead to the attic
merrill and graham step away as the closet folding door holds the weight of the attic door
after a moment the spring on the attic trapdoor recoils as the pressure is let up
the trapdoor closes
it opens with force slamming the top of the standing closet door with a thud
the attic trapdoor closes again
opens again with force
the closet folding door begins to pull away from the hinges keeping it upright
graham moves down the stairs
merrill follows him
morgan and bo are frozen watching a set of long fingers reach under the front door
the color of the fingers changes to graham and merrill arrive in the front hall
graham takes morgan and bo by the hand and leads them quickly down the hall
merrill backs away as he watches the top of the stairs
the swinging door swings open and closed behind merrill as he enters the kitchen
graham has moved the chairs away from the kitchen table and waits by it
merrill goes over and the two of them push the table against the swinging door
they take the kitchen chairs and pile a couple on top and jam the rest underneath the table
graham leans against the kitchen counter
merrill stares at the pile of furniture
this is going to do nothing
we have to go in the basement
graham points to a set of narrow stairs that lead to a darkened door at the bottom
theres no way out of there
graham looks at the faces of his frightened children
did i ever tell you i dislocated uncle merrills arm
should we make a run for it out the back
theyre right behind the door
merrill looks at the boarded up back door
graham turns to bo and morgan who stand against the wall
he was only a year and half old
to graham what are you doing
he was trying to eat a second chocolate bar
your grandma said no
he tried to take a bite so i grabbed it
thud with a crack of wood from upstairs
merrill turns and stares at the barricaded entrance to the kitchen
i must have pulled his arm at an awkward angle
his elbow popped right out of the socket
he didnt scream or anything
his arm just flopped to his side and he got real still
graham moves towards the basement stairs
i held him in my lap in the back seat as we drove to the hospital
i couldnt stop crying
we need to go into the basement now
graham gestures for the kids to come to the stairs
morgan and bo move to their father slowly
you know what your uncle merrill did right after the doctor put his arm back in place
he jumped off the table and gave me a hug
he had already forgotten that i was the one who hurt him
graham ushers the two children down the stairs
he waits for merrill
merrill turns from the kitchen door and walks toward him
merrill stops and looks down the stairs
we wont be able to get out of there
im sorry i hurt your arm
merrills eyes fill with water
he doesnt look up at his older brother
merrill walks down the stairs
graham waits at the top
he watches the kitchen door with the table and chairs against it
the door starts to force its way open
the table and chairs graham comes down the last few steps and enters the basement
we forgot our foil helmets
graham closes the door behind him
it has no lock
we need something to wedge against the doorknob
the basement is lined with metal shelves
the shelves are cluttered with all sorts of canned goods extension cords cleaning supplies decorations outdoor tools
merrill rummages through the shelves frantically
theyll read our minds
youre scaring your sister
im already scared
graham puts his ear to the door and listens
merrill im looking
merrill moves to another set of shelves
he starts knocking things to the ground
to himself theyll know our secret thoughts
there is scratching against the door
the doorknob turns
graham grabs it with both hands
the door begins to push open
merrill reaches between two stacks of shelves and pulls out a pick for digging in the ground
he holds it up in the air
it has a three foot wooden handle
merrill turns and rushes in grahams direction
a single light bulb hangs from a wire in the ceiling
it is the only light in the room
merrill clips the light bulb with the end of the wooden handle as he crosses the room
morgan slowly moves the beam back up to his fathers wheres bo
he turns the knob to on
the radio lights up but no sound emerges for its speakers
merrill turns the channel knob and checks all the stations
he listens to the light hum from the speakers
whats happening out there
in the dark i cant even imagine
i hope theyre doing better than we are
we dont even have helmets
graham steps into the beam of lights
he looks at the door and then turns and faces the lights
theyre just making noises
theyre not trying to get in
beat why are they doing that
graham looks at merrills corner of the darkness
morgan moves his beam onto merrill
they want our attention on the door
a beat of silence
theyre distracting us
the book says theyre probably very good problem solvers
theyll find a way in
morgan give me your flashlight
morgan puts the flashlight on the ground and rolls it across the flashlight comes to a stop in grahams palm
he picks it up
is there an air vent in here
merrill moves next to graham
another bang from the door
they aim their flashlights in one corner of the room
the brothers move in opposite directions
merrill and graham are at opposite ends of the room now
i can feel air
its getting stronger
hold the vent
merrill slowly catches his breath
he reaches over to his side and grabs the remaining flashlight
he trains the beam we dont have his medicine
merrill looks at his nephew turning gray
graham pulls morgan closer to his body and talks into the childs ear
dont be scared morgan
well slow it down together
feel my chest
feel it going in and out
breathe like me
breathe like me
morgans throat is closing his face is filled with strain and panic
he cant breathe
bo moves to merrill and curls up with him as they watch
graham closes his eyes
he opens his eyes and talks into morgans ear
stay with me
stay with me
i know it hurts
be strong baby
graham closes his eyes talks to the darkness
dont do this to me again
merrill stares at his brothers desperate face
grahams eyes open as morgans tiny fingers press down on grahams hand
the fingers squeeze with all the strength they have
graham looks to merrill helplessly
merrills eyes fill up with water
grahams eyes close
i hate you
i hate you
grahams eyes open as he leans in close to morgans ear
the fear is feeding it
dont be afraid of whats happening
believe its going to pass
dont be afraid
the air is coming
we dont have to be afraid
its about to pass
here it comes
dont be afraid
here comes the air
there we go
we dont have to be scared at all
we know itll pass
we believe it
dont be afraid morgan
morgans fingers relax a little on grahams hand
merrill watches as grahams face stays pressed up against his son
feel my chest
breathe with me
the air is going in our lungs
were the same
were the same
merrill watches as morgans chest starts to move in sync with grahams
grahams eyes close
he starts crying
he speaks to no one
soft i hate you
morgans fingers relax on grahams hand
merrill watches as father and son breathe together
merrill and bo hold each other tight
i should save the flashlights
graham nods without looking over
merrill looks down to bo who has the second flashlight in her hand
the beam points up at the basement ceiling above merrill nods to her
she reaches down and presses the button
jordan saudi arabia and bahrain have also confirmed
graham opens his eyes from sleep
he squints from the light merrill steps into his vision
i found a pack of light bulbs
merrill walks back to the radio on the metal shelf
the parts of china and northern korea are among the few remaining to verify withdrawals
it came on about two hours ago
woke me up
beat we won graham
merrill waits for his brother to say something
it went on all night
it was completely a ground battle
mostly hand to hand
you cant see them unless youre up close
a lot of people died
some from combat
but most from poison gas inhalation
they secrete it
how many died
they think over a hundred thousand
theyre just estimates
beat but we held strong
how do they know its over
a mass evacuation by them started about eight oclock this morning
its eleven now
beat theyre leaving
you didnt think wed make it
low voice listen theres things i can take and a couple things i cant and one of them i cant take is when my older brother voice cracks who is
everything i want to be starts losing faith in things
i saw your eyes last night
beat i dont want to ever see your eyes like that again okay
merrills face is hard
he looks shaken
graham stares at the conviction in his younger brothers expression
theres a wheezing sound from the corner of the room
graham and merrill turn to look at morgan laying down on merrills folded sweater
morgans breathing is strained
he still looks grey
hes been like that for awhile
we need to get him some medicine
have they said anything about our area
philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared but who knows for sure
graham looks at morgan lying limp on the ground
graham turns to merrill
whispers hes not strong enough to fight off another attack
whispers i know
beat we need to be sure before we open that door graham
the two men stand under the single dangling light bulb
graham quietly turns and looks at morgan
he moves across the room towards him
merrill watches as graham kneels down and reaches to morgans side
graham unclips the baby monitor from his sons belt
graham walks back to merrill
he holds it out between them
he turns it on
graham makes eye contact with merrill
thats good enough for me
the basement door cracks open a few inches
merrill opens it all the way
merrill moves up the stairs by himself
he reaches the top and looks around
turns back down to the faces at the bottom
gives them the thumbs up
graham leads bo up the stairs
he carries a limp morgan in his arms
graham and bo and morgan watch as merrill walks over the toppled chairs to get to the cabinets
get the syringe as well
we might need to give him an epinephrine shot
merrill nods as he begins to search the piles of things that have fallen from the cabinets
graham gently lays morgan on the sofa
bo steps out of the closet and looks into the family room
people are dancing
she points at the closet
morgan strains to look in her direction
graham looks at him
you want to see it
morgan nods yes as he struggles to breathe
ill bring the tv in here
today there are no countries and no races and no differences we are all apart of the same graham unplugs the television
the screen goes black
bo moves the coats aside as graham wheels the television and the television cart out into the hall
graham pulls the television into the family room
careful not to trip it on the carpet
graham moves the television into position
the black screen the tv stops moving
graham stays frozen with his hands on either side of the television cart
hes slightly bent over
his back is to the family room
graham straightens and turns around slowly
morgan is held by his waist three feet in the air
morgans face turns to the color of ash as his throat closes up
for a moment it appears hes suspended in the air
then we see the outlines
and we see the eyes
the black eyes
there is a creature close to seven feet tall standing in the middle of the family room
its powdery skin has taken on the shades lines and colors of the family room so perfectly it almost disappears
graham and bo have turned to stone
bo stands frozen in the front hall
merrill comes out of the doorway from the kitchen to the family room
he takes two steps into the room and comes to a stop next to the fireplace
the inhaler and syringe in his hand fall to the ground
the creature is between graham and merrill in the middle of the family room
morgan is dying
the last sounds of air stop in his throat
the lines of the chairs and windowsill mimicked on the creatures skin move as the creature moves its free hand
grahams eyes shift to the hand
three of the creatures the creatures hand moves to morgans face
it tilts its fingers and palm back
the colors on the hand are already a small pore opens up on its wrist
a yellowish gas starts graham looks up from the leaking poison gas to the face of the creature
its large empty black eyes lock on grahams
soft hes reading my the car door opens
graham hess steps out
his coat is open
he is wearing a black shirt and black pants
a priests white collar sits under the lapel of the black shirt
graham looks around in a daze
we are on a country road
there are strobing red and white lights filling the night air
four police cars are scattered amongst the tow trucks and the ambulances
a large group of officers and workers hover around a green truck that has swerved off the road into a grouping of trees
officer edgar paski walks up to graham
he whispers something into a walkie clipped to his shirt as he approaches
edgar looks badly shaken
the two men look at each other
what do you know
graham stands motionless with his hands at his sides
there was an accident
they werent sure
he wasnt drinking
ray fell asleep at the wheel
officer paski gestures in the direction of one of the ambulances
ray reddy sits to the side on the grass
his arms rest on his bent knees
is he okay
thats the first thing colleen asked too
graham smiles a little smile
which ambulance is she in
shes not in an ambulance father
see father rays truck swerved off the road and ah
hit colleen and then a tree
she was pinned between the two
what does that mean
the truck has severed most of her lower half
what did you say
she wont be saved
at this point shes alive because the truck is holding her together
she doesnt feel much and shes talking almost like normal
we didnt pull the truck out cause we wanted you to come down here to be with her as long as shes awake
that wont be very long
beat father you understand what ive told you
he starts crying is this the last time im going to talk to my wife
yes it is
the other officers turn and look as graham walks by them
he walks on unaware of the stares
he slows as he reaches the back bumper of the truck
it sticks out onto the road a few feet
he comes around the side of the vehicle
colleen hess is beautiful in a delicate way
her straight brown hair falls down over her small face
she leans over the front bumper of the truck onto the hood
her head rests on her arms like a child resting on a school desk
her back is against a tree
the lower half of her is obscured by the truck
shes able to raise her head and shoulders as graham walks up to her
she is shivering slightly
soft hi sweetie
graham glances down
there are bundles of blood soaked blankets in the area below her
they peek out under the twisted front of the truck
graham looks up quickly
i was just taking a walk before dinner
you love walks
i guess it was meant to be
does it hurt
i dont feel much
graham touches her cheek
she starts crying
graham starts crying with her
crying tell morgan to play games its okay to be silly
crying i will
crying tell bo to listen to her brother
hell always take care of her
crying i will
crying tell graham crying im here
crying tell him
tell him to see
colleen presses her cheek on top of grahams hand
she rests on it
her eyes are distant
soft and tell merrill to swing away
graham stares at the baseball bat on the wall
soft swing away merrill
morgans face is obscured by gas
merrill turns and looks to graham
grahams eyes are not on merrill
merrill follows his eye line to the baseball bat mounted above him
merrill reaches up and takes the bat off its resting place
the creature starts to move
merrills hands tighten around the handle as he walks forward
his weight shifts to his right leg
the creature begins to turn and becomes more visible as its lines and colors dont match in position in the room
merrills left leg goes out
his torso and shoulders turn with staggering speed and strength
the bat slices through the air of the family room
the creature gets hammered across the back with the baseball bat
morgan is dropped
he falls to the carpet of the family room in an unnatural crumpled pile
his arms and legs flop lifelessly to the carpet
the creature turns to face merrill
all the creature sees is the blur of wood as merrill swings like a lumberjack
the creature falls to the ground
graham takes bo by the hand and moves to morgan
graham picks up his sons limp body in his arms
the creature moves to its feet
merrills hands choke up on the bat
merrills eyes are on fire
graham leans down and picks up the full syringe of medicine on the ground
merrill screams as he swings again
his powerful muscles pull his shoulders whipping around
the bat connects with the creature across its chest
the creature is thrown back into the wall
two glass of water fall off a shelf and crash onto the creatures shoulder
the water connects with its skin
the creature makes a high pitched inhale sound
bo and graham look up
merrill looks back across the room at bo and graham
they stare at each other with sudden realization
merrill looks around at bos half filled water glasses places all over the family room
graham carries morgan through the kitchen and out the back door
morgans arms and legs swing limp as graham walks
morgans head bobs back from its own weight as graham steps outside
merrill steps in
the wooden bat makes a sound as it cuts through the air
it connects with the creature
the creature falls back into the coffee table
bos glasses of water crack and splash over the creatures torso
another high pitched inhale scream
his torso turns a powdery white
parts of its body are still changing and matching its environment
parts are white
the creature stands again
merrill looks for the next target in the room
bo points to the dinning table where the old chicken teriyaki bacon cheeseburger and spaghetti with meatballs sit untouched
merrill sees the three glasses of water at bos seat
merrill yells with everything in his lungs
his wrists turn
his shoulders torque
the wooden louisville slugger slices bo watches quietly from the door
merrill drops the handle of the bat in his hands
merrill and bo find graham kneeling in the grass
morgan lays limp in his arms
they kneel down in the grass with him
merrill sees the empty syringe in grahams hand
he looks to morgan
the boys head is tilted back
his tiny mouth hangs open unnaturally
his lungs were closed
beat his lungs were closed
no poison got in
no poison got in
merrill stares at morgan
his body is utterly still
his lungs were closed
merrill reaches for morgans still hand
dont touch him
morgan lies lifeless
dont touch him
bo is crying
his sons voice makes him stop
graham starts crying
every bit of sadness trapped in his body is released
he looks down through tears and tears at morgan
did someone save me
i think someone did
we look out through the broken glass of the second story bedroom window
we see the worn jungle gym
we see the single tree throwing shade on the picnic table
we see the golden brown corn lining the back of the yard
and we see the hess family
sitting together on the grass
huddled together in the sunlight
