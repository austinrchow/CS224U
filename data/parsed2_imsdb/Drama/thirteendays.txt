the glory of stratospheric dawn
the engines of a silver lockheed u f rasp upon the trace oxygen here at feet
scattered cloud formations hang over the blue brilliance of sea far far below
in the haze the looming edge of land
the spy planes camera doors whine open
the glassy eye of the inch camera focuses
and then with a bangbangbangbang its high speed motor kicks in shutter flying
a simple camera snapping away furiously in the hands of a giggling mark odonnell
hes straddling and in the face of his dad kenny odonnell s tough boston irish with a prodigious case of morning hair
kenny awakens red eyed
mark get off your father
kenny sits up to the morning bedlam of the odonnell house
kids screech doors bang all over
kenny pushes mark over rolls out of bed snatches up the corners of the blanket and hoists mark over his shoulder in a screaming kicking bundle
kenny with mark in the bundle on his shoulder meets his wife helen going the other way in the hall with little helen in her arms
they kiss in passing
daughter kathy races by in angry pursuit of her twin kevin
dont forget mrs
higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about kevin
you need to do something about this
kids are supposed to get detention
kenny dumps the bundle with mark in a big pile of dirty laundry
a pair of massive film canisters unlock and drop from the belly of the u
technicians secure them in orange carrying cases lock them under key fast and proficient
they whisk them out from under the spy plane
the technicians run for an idling jeep
they sling the cases into the rear of the vehicle which in turn accelerates away hard curving across the runway for another waiting plane

a phone rings as the kids cry out en masse

kenny glances up at the wall
there are two phones side by side
one red one black
its the black one ringing
kenny goes back to his papers

as the car stops at the gate the camera flies past revealing its the gate to the white close on the five thousand rolls of film spewing through processing equipment
its streaking passage leading us straight through the development machinery to photo interpreters power up light tables stereoscopic viewers zip across the floor in wheeled chairs
flying switches flickering lights humming motors
its an eerie dance of technological black magic
another pair of interpreters loom out of the darkness side by side ghostly looking their glasses reflecting the glare of the light table like magicians staring into a crystal ball
aerial shots flashing by
cuban countryside from feet
a magnifying glass swings down on its arm in front of us magnifying the carpet of trees
and a row of six canvas covered objects among them
kenny in business suit and tie trots up the steps and a marine guard snaps the door open for him
kenny briefcase in hand weaves his way through the empty ornate hallways of the west wing
past magnificent doorways early american furniture paintings
he finally reaches a doorway goes through into a long narrow affair window at the back looking out into the rose garden
kenny dumps his briefcase on the desk shucks off his coat removes a folder from his briefcase turns and heads back out
and into the warren of offices and halls that is the working white house
he takes a right passes the doors to the oval office right next to his office goes down a long straight hall into
the formal main building the executive mansion
he passes the busts of presidents past turns left into an elevator
the doors close
the doors open
kenny strides out onto a different floor the third
he heads down the long posh hall of the family quarters
fine furnishings art
the living white house
he approaches the double doors at the end of the hall guarded by a cluster of secret service agents
an agent opens one of the doors
good morning mr
kenny enters the elegant bedroom
the figure alone at a side table by the window drinks coffee breakfast still spread out before him washington post obscuring his face
top o the morning mr
the figure lowers the paper
it is president john f
hes wearing boxers and a tank top
kenny odonnell former ward pol and long time kennedy man is his chief of staff
you see this goddamn capehart stuff
the president rattles the paper
kenny collapses in the chair opposite the president sprawls comfortable
bayhs going to lose but its good groundwork for us for
kenny steals a piece of buttered toast off the presidents plate
the president spares him a glance
i was eating that
no you werent
scanning the paper i was you bastard
kenny takes a defiant bite
so whatve we got today
today for your information is pulaski day
were going to buffalo
a luxury hotel crowded with local pols the democratic machine of buffalo
beyond the open floor to ceiling windows a crowd
the pulaski day parade a glimpse of s americana
high school bands blare sousa
the scene is deafening boisterous
pols trail kenny as he crosses the room fast tough on the go
were putting up potowski next time
will you guys come out for him
who else you got
got the touch
still moldable too
everyone likes a good kid
and like that a congressional candidate is made
kenny accelerates leaving the pols behind
suddenly outside the windows the crowd swells forward with a collective roar
kenny heads down the steps with new york times washington bureau chief scotty reston
anonymous they weave their way through the crowd for a police car on a side street
hows my favorite president
but youve got his heart
i want an hour with him
i said his heart not his attention
three weeks before midterm elections
you need me
there is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about
im doing a piece on skybolt
i hear macmillans meeting with him in nassau
kenny just sighs as they make their way up to the police car
a secret service agent opens the door for him another is behind the wheel
were giving the brits polaris instead
but a storyll just aggravate things
scotty stares at kenny determined
kenny looks away
and his eye catches a tall willowy beautiful woman
she is talking excited embarrassed to two more secret service agents
what theyre saying is lost in the noise
scotty follows kennys gaze
then the two men share a look a silent understanding
kenny glances at the secret service guy holding the car door tilts his head at the woman
hes got tight schedule
the agent nods heads for the other agents and the beautiful woman
scotty acts like nothing has happened
pretending there isnt a problem wont fix it
he can clear the air on anglo american relations
forget it scotty
let him talk to me he makes macmillan look good i print it the british public likes it macmillan owes you
the formulas exactly what kenny wants to hear
he pretends to consider pretends to cave as he gets in the car
all right youre in
but so has kenny and hes made scotty feel tough in the bargain
people like kenny
in the back seat kenny stares out the window at the parade goers
the secret service agents leave the woman
disappointed the woman turns and vanishes into the crowd
its an eerie moment
something troubles kenny and he glances up at the sky
but its a clear clear blue
a day like this all is right with the world
six interpreters huddle around images on a light table
one of them shoulders his way into the group and thumps a black binder on the table
there are grim nods of agreement
the book is open to a picture of an ss ballistic missile
a photo from moscow mayday parade
an icon of the nuclear age escorted like some devil god to a holocaust
the white house casts long shadows this gorgeous october morning
blue sky the first flash of color in the trees
briefcase and coat in hand kenny enters his office and finds three men
thin haired bespectacled academic looking mcgeorge bundy the national security advisor
the two men in the background photo interpreters
kenny hangs up his coat sees the interpreters large black display cases
and suddenly the world is slightly off kilter
youre up bright and early
i need to see him now
kenny emerges from the elevator with bundy
they head down the long posh rd floor hall the presidential detail guarding the doors at the end
but the familiar route feels strange and lasting an eternity
kenny eyes the package under bundys arm its top secret stamp visible
good morning mr
the agent opens the door
bundy pauses kenny with him
whats it about
bundy is tense
but kenny relaxes
okay i got work to do see you guys downstairs
kennys office is a raging beehive of activity
kenny works the phone as assistants come and go with files
to phone scary calm listen to me you worthless piece of disloyal shit
you will pull dalys man on the circuit
you owe your goddamn job to this administration
beat listening there is a word you need to learn
it is the only word in politics
loyalty you motherfucking piece of shit
as kenny throws the phone down at the receiver and the private door to the oval office suddenly opens
kenny glances up
president kennedy stands there in the doorway
kenny thinks hes reacting to the tirade
whatre you looking at
this isnt the blessed order of st
mary the meek
the assistants leave shutting the door after them
i think you should come in here
kenny starts for the door
still think cuba isnt important
not as far as the election goes
the president lets kenny by into
we enter from a different angle than we usually enter in movies through the side door
the presidents ornate desk sits on the right windows looking out on the rose garden behind it
kennys gaze swivels to the other end of the room where the interpreters their crewcut chief arthur lundahl s and bundy stare at him
theyre surrounded by presentation boards propped up around the fireplace
the presidents rocking chair and sofas
you used to look down a bomb sight for a living ken
what do you see
in eerie silence as all eyes follow him kenny makes his way among the presentation boards with the u imagery stops in front of the picture of the six canvas
it unleashes a wave of memories
we hit a nazi buzz bomb field in
beat incredulous it looks like a rocket base
he puts his hand out to touch the image then turns and looks to the president knowing what they must be
on sunday morning one of our u s took these pictures
the soviets are putting medium range ballistic missiles into cuba
kenny glances to the other men
they appear to be the ss range of a thousand miles three megaton nuclear warhead
jesus christ in heaven
a bank of white house operators work the switchboard fingers flying voices overlapping in a babble of please hold for the white house
odonnell for secretary mcnamara
white house operator
kenny carries the phone with him as he paces hard from his desk to his window
the principals are assembling in an hour
see you then
kenny hangs up
the president enters
and in that beat theres a void
the two men are off their emotional stride trying to grope their way out of shock
kenny nods acknowledging the feeling should be here any minute
and we glimpse the chemistry of these guys by bobbys absence
its like theyre missing their third wheel
where the hell are you
the president and kenny hear him out in the hall
and the tension goes out of them instantly
they turn to the door as bobby kennedy the presidents younger brother attorney general enters
bobby shuts the door behind him falls into kennys chair and clearly grappling with his own disbelief is hushed
jesus christ guys
what the hells khruschev thinking
did you have any indication of this from georgi
any possible warning or sense of motivation
shaking his head complete snowjob
and then we went out and told the country they werent putting missiles into cuba
beat by the way you realize we just lost the midterms
who gives a shit about the midterms now
the soviets are putting nuclear weapons ninety miles away from us
you mean theres something more important than votes
didnt think id live to see the day ken
the president paces away grim
i feel like weve caught the jap carriers steaming for pearl harbor
the president strides down the plush hallway bobby and kenny flanking him
unconsciously all three men assume the same gait confident powerful no longer disoriented
and before our eyes the three mens game faces appear and they become the hard ass leaders of the united states
secret service agents throw open the massive double doors to the cabinet room
and they enter
the group of men at the long ornate roosevelt era table rise as one
good morning mr
good morning gentlemen
and the doors close on the eighteen men of excom the executive committee of the national security council
they are the legendary best and brightest
the president makes his way down the line shakes hands with secretary of state dean rusk distinguished with a soft georgian accent a distant reserve
dean good morning
the president leans past him grasps the hand of the secretary of defense robert mcnamara a gifted managerial genius
the price of which is a cold hard personality
bet you had a late night
sleep is for the weak mr
off to the side kenny greets vice president lyndon johnson and adlai stevenson representative to the u
intellectual well spoken
the silver haired war hero and politically savvy chairman of the joint chiefs of staff general maxwell taylor s shakes the presidents hand
mccones been notified and is coming back from the west coast
carters here though
he gestures to general marshall carter deputy chief of operations for the cia
carter nods to the president
douglas dillon ex banker secretary of the treasury
roswell gilpatric studious deputy secretary of defense
paul nitze the detail driven facts man assistant secretary of defense
george ball s undersecretary of state
eloquent a man of conscience
alexis johnson deputy under secretary of state
edward martin assistant secretary of state for latin america
llewellyn thompson laid back rumpled soviet affairs advisor
don wilson deputy director of the usia
the president sits down at the center of the table rusk and mcnamara to either side and the others resume their seats
bobby takes one of the over stuffed chairs at the table
kenny finds one along the wall behind the president under the windows to the rose garden to ted sorensen s the presidents legal counsel and speech writer
they greet each other coolly
the room falls silent
the president looks across the table to general carter
lets have it
arthur lundahl heads our photographic interpretation division at cia
ill let him and his boys take you through what weve got
lundahl standing at the end of the room with briefing boards steps forward with a pointer
gentlemen as most of you now know a u over cuba on sunday morning took a series of disturbing photographs
the sweltering cuban countryside
shouting soviet rocket troops stripped to the waist glistening with sweat machete a clearing under scattered limp palm trees
our analysis at npic indicates the soviet union has followed its conventional weapons build up in cuba with the introduction of surface to surface medium range ballistic missiles or mrbms
our official estimate at this time is that this missile system is the ss sandal
we do not believe these missiles are as yet operational
a bulldozer tears through the undergrowth
filling the screen
a foot long missile transporter creeps along in the bulldozers wake like a vast hearse with its shrouded cargo
lundahl raps his second board a map of the united states cuba visible in the lower corner
an arc is drawn clearly across the u
encompassing the entire southeast
ironbark reports the ss can deliver a megaton nuclear weapon miles
so far we have identified missiles served by around men undoubtedly all soviet personnel
our cities and military installations in the southeast as far north as washington are in range of these weapons and in the event of a launch would only have five
minutes of warning
five minutes gentlemen
in those five minutes they could kill million americans and destroy a significant number of our bomber bases degrading our retaliatory options
the joint chiefs consensus is that this is a massively destabilizing move upsetting the nuclear balance
the president stares at lundahl and beating out each word
lundahl looks around the room
everyone is hanging
these are nuclear missiles
the men come to grips with their own fears own anger
how long until theyre operational
general taylor can answer that question better than i can
general taylor drops a memo on the table which becomes schematics slapped down on a camp table
a group of soviet site engineers point and gesture as they study their ground from a shaded hillock
clearing crews and surveyors work and sweat in the distance
gmaic estimates ten to fourteen days
however a crash program to ready the missiles could cut that time
taylor sees the grim looks all around
i have to stress that there may be more missiles that we dont know about
we need more u coverage
kenny lets out his breath
he catches bobbys eye
this is unbelievable
is there any indication anything at all that suggests they intend to use these missiles in some sort of first strike
not at present sir
but i think the prudent answer is we dont know
do we have any sort of intelligence from cia on what khruschev is thinking
we just dont know whats happening inside the kremlin at that level
they lied to us
two weeks ago dobrynin told me to my face khurschev had no intention of putting missiles into cuba
they said themselves this is our backyard
theres angry agreement
the president cuts it off
gentlemen i want first reactions
assuming for a moment khruschev has not gone off the deep end and intends to start world war three what are we looking at
rusk glances to his team at the end of the table
ball johnson martin thompson and stevenson
president i believe my team is in agreement
if we permit the introduction of nuclear missiles to a soviet satellite nation in our hemisphere the diplomatic consequences will be too terrible to contemplate
the russians are trying to show the world they can do whatever they want wherever they want and were powerless to stop them
if they succeed
it will be munich all over again
appeasement only makes the aggressor more aggressive
confidence in our security commitments around the world will falter allies will become unsure in the face of soviet pressure and the soviets will be emboldened to push us even
we must remove the missiles one way or another
it seems to me the options are either to build up the crisis til they give in or we hit them
an air strike
theres silence at the table
weve worked up several military scenarios
before i ask general taylor to lead us through the various options id like for us to adopt a rule
if we are going to strike we must agree now that we will do it before the missiles become operational
because once they are i dont think we can guarantee getting them all before at least some are launched
and there it is
the clock is running
we need to consider
if we decide to act theres a good chance well end up in a general war
the room falls silent
the president leans back in his chair studying the circle of men around the table weighing them
kenny and the others watch him in silence
a long dramatic pause
a course that will change history is about to be chosen
the president leans forward folds his hands on the table
its clear we cannot permit soviet nuclear missiles in cuba
we must get those missiles out
kenny and bobby follow the president down a path through the rose garden
the shock of the morning has worn off
the president stops looks at them
i dont think its going to matter what khruschevs intentions are
i tell you right now
i dont see any way around hitting them
a long moment of silence as they move along again
if we hit em kill a lot of russians theyll move against berlin
they attack berlin thats nato
and were at war
the guys stop again
the autumn day is bright warm alive
the air the distant city sounds derail the relentless train of logic for a beat
and in their faces we see that all three men for the first time feel the enormity of war its shadow over everything
its only a couple of steps away
steps that theyre seriously contemplating
damned if we do but if we dont were in a war for sure somewhere else in six months
pained the president turns away
this is going to cost lives any way we go
do nothing and it could be million of ours
we have to get rid of those missiles
thereve got to be alternatives to just going out and bombing them
hes right jack
taylor is saying we may have some time
weve got to use it
so if there are alternatives that make sense and im not saying there are we need em
need em fast
what about the allies
i think we may need to start letting key people know
and theyre all scattered across the country for the campaign
were going to need to get the u
staff in and warmed up
i dont even know if weve got secure communications with half our embassies since that the soviets got that cryptographer of ours
we cant worry about everything right now
weve got to figure out what were going to do before we worry about how we do it
the other thing is
cia and the military fucked us on the bay of pigs
theyre going to be pressing for a military solution soon
we cant afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats
we need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here
we got a bunch of smart guys
we lock em up together in there kick em in the ass til they come up with options
kenny and the president look at him
ill do it
to the president its too politicized with you in there anyway
they need to be able to stick their necks out
itll be the principals a couple of the key guys from each department the executive committee of the national security council
well call it excom
kenny snorts a laugh
bobby shoots him a cross look
has a ring to it
like f troop
the president stops
bobby and kenny stop too
kenny and i only show for the meetings you call us into
and do it fast
to kenny youre in charge of keeping this quiet
if word gets out before we know what were going to do therell be panic
and itll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them
then we need to do a few things right away
he knows the press knows
youre going to have to keep up your schedule your movements are followed too closely
and we need to get these guys out of the white house
george balls got a conference room at state
to bobby reconvene over there this afternoon come back here tonight
i think we should bring in dean acheson
he was fighting soviets while we were still working the wards in boston
the president nods his approval
looks at kenny
find him kenny
were going to need all the help we can get
kenny moves hard and fast through the twisting warren of hallways and tiny offices which is the west wing
suddenly scotty reston pops out of a doorway behind kenny
kenny glances over his shoulder at scotty who points to a window
a beat then kenny returns to look out the window
outside the west wing drive is filled with limousines
a flash of dismay but kenny covers fast
way its going the democratic party
dnc strategy session
if you can call it that
kenny moves off leading him away
kennys assistant runs up behind him holding out a slip of paper
kenny tries to look him away
you said to call
when do i get my minutes
tell you what
were in connecticut tomorrow for ribicoff
ill get you up front with him during the flight
kenny turns harsh what is it
the assistant eyes scotty holds his tongue
kenny takes the slips
the number you asked for
i ask for a lot of em
whose is it
dean achesons sir
that shuts kenny up
reston eyes the slip then looks to kennys face
and he knows something isnt right here
gotta go scotty
see you tomorrow
a car jolts to a stop
the camera pans up over the sagging suspension the government plates the hood ornament revealing half of excom inside
kenny stands nearby waiting for them
the doors open and out they pile like a bunch of clowns bobby mcnamara rusk ball martin dioptric sorensen stevenson and nitze
theyre sitting in each others laps banging their heads on the roof joking but tense
you try having that fat ass sit on your lap all the way from foggy bottom
you were excited
i say no more
the gang falls in behind kenny trails him out of the garage
a steel door unlocks swings open and kenny marches at the head of the wedge of men into a long tunnel
its the infamous old passage from the treasury to the white house
kenny and bobby get a little ahead of the others
everybody agrees the diplomatic route is out
its too slow and theyll have the missiles finished
kenny looks at him
then theres only one alternative
the camera wipes through the ceiling to ground level
where the brilliantly lit flag flutters over the spotlit white house their destination
general walter cam sweeney head of tactical air command stands at the head of the table with a presentation board
the men of excom gather around sweeney in their rumpled shirts nursing coffee and cigarettes
we have planes assembling at homestead eglin opa locka macdill patrick pensacola and key west
an f super sabre stands under lights on a taxiway
the camera descends from its overhead shot discovering the aircrafts sleek cockpit menacing tiger jaw paint job the four mm cannons on its nose
due to the tropical foliage the oplan calls for high explosive and napalm loadouts for our ground attack sorties
the flight line where a full strike wing stands beyond this plane pylons laden with weapons ground crew servicing them
other excom members draw near the board its order of battle strike maps
theyre grim but fascinated
kenny sees it in the faces even the presidents
adlai does too is upset
i still think there are diplomatic approaches we havent considered yet
kenny looks at adlai
the others around the room embarrassed dont respond
the group has moved on and stevenson hasnt
we have high confidence in the expanded air strike option
beat the problem mr
president is that its a short term solution
khruschev can send more missiles next month
the chiefs and i believe we should follow up the air strikes with the full version of an invasion
we can be sure we get all the missiles and we remove castro so this can never happen again
kenny looks around the room at the men the murmurs of general agreement senses the consensus building and is agitated
is this the chiefs recommendation
our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational
the invasion happens eight days later
the president leans back in his chair turns to the man at the far end of the table dean acheson s former secretary of state
he sits silent like some revered oracle the architect of the american cold war strategy of containment
what do you think
acheson arches an eyebrow and when he speaks his voice resonates throughout the room powerful smooth hypnotic
president you have rightly dismissed the diplomatic option
the soviet will only tie you down in negotiation and leave us short of our goal the removal of the missiles
negotiating will do nothing more than give them time to make the missiles operational complicating the necessary military task we have at hand
everyone in the room listens to him with rapt attention his presence overshadowing the room oracular for the last fifteen years i have fought here at this table along side
your predecessors in the struggle against the soviet
gentlemen i do not wish to seem melodramatic but i do wish to impress upon you one observation with all conceivable sincerity
a lesson i have learned with bitter tears and great sacrifice
beat the soviet understands only one language action
it respects only one word force
kenny stares at the old man
achesons gaze finds his through the cigarette smoke
achesons eyes travel to the president
i concur with general taylor
i recommend sir air strikes followed by invasion perhaps preceded by an ultimatum to dismantle the missiles if military necessity permits
taylor nods vindicated
the others murmur their approval
bobby at the table in front of kenny and to his left trades a dire look with kenny
this is happening too fast
bobby holds his head looks about at the others deeply distressed
the president sinks back in his chair staring at acheson
then it appears we have three options
a surgical air strike against the missiles themselves
two a larger air strike against their air defenses along with the missiles
kenny eyes bobby
bobby is writing something
and three invasion
bobby looks over his shoulder at kenny and reaches back to him with a folded note
kenny takes it opens it
it reads now i know who tojo felt planning pearl harbor
were certainly going to do number one were going to take out these missiles so it seems to me we dont have to wait very long
we ought to at least be making those preparations
kenny gives bobby a curt nod
bobby tilts his head at the president pass the note on to him
kenny rises slips the note in front of the president
the president unfolds the note and we hold on it and his reaction as in the b
out of focus taylor speaks yes sir were preparing to implement all three options though i must stress again sir there are risks to the strikes without the follow on
bundy clears his throat
speaks from somewhere down the table
you want to be clear mr
president that we have definitely decided against a political track
the president folds the note away glances at bobby
a beat the president looks from bobby to acheson
dean how does this play out
your first step sir will be to demand that the soviet withdraw the missiles within to hours
they will refuse
when they do you will order the strikes followed by the invasion
they will resist but will be overrun
they will retaliate against a target somewhere else in the world most likely berlin
we will honor our treaty commitments and resist them there defeating them per our plans
those plans call for the use of nuclear weapons
beat and what is the next step
acheson sits back in his chair smooths his moustache
a dramatic beat and then his ominous pronouncement rings out hopefully cooler heads will prevail before we reach the next step
a chill runs down kennys spine
he looks in shock to the president
the president remains calm
but in place of the fated look the president has had theres a hesitation
acheson strides down the hall taylor sweeney carter and bundy swept along behind him
bundy is on the defensive the others grim
if mcnamarad get off the fence
we have time
goddamn it its obvious
its the only option
that asshole stevenson
we cant let this drag out or we lose our shot
remember that the kennedys father was one of the architects of munich
the general is right
there is only one responsible choice here
bundy just nods
taylor grabs a door ahead for acheson
lets pray appeasement doesnt run in families
i fear weakness does
and the men head into a stairwell going down
grimacing in pain
he opens a pill bottle takes two pills out
he takes a whiskey in a shot glass from kenny
kenny finishes pouring him and bobby a couple of more shots discreetly turning a blind eye to the presidents pain
the president returns from his desk shirt untucked disheveled back stiff
he eases into his rocking chair
bobby lies sprawled on the couch
kenny sits down
they all look at each other
a beat something like shock
jesus christ almighty
they burst out laughing
an absurd tension draining moment
they shoot their drinks kenny refills
call me irish but i dont believe in cooler heads prevailing
achesons scenario is unacceptable
and he has more experience than anyone
there is no expert on this subject no wise old man
the president stares kenny in the face understanding
the thing is achesons right
talk alone wont accomplish anything
kenny considers the president his face straight as he says then lets bomb the shit out of them
everyone wants to even you even me
theres a point it sure would feel good
the president sees what kennys saying itd be an emotional response not necessarily the intelligent one
jack im as conniving as they come but a sneak attack is just wrong
and things are happening too fast
it smells like the bay of pigs all over again
bobby picks up some reconnaissance photos on the coffee table
as if dealing with the russians wasnt hard enough we gotta worry about our own house
tonight listening to taylor and acheson i kept seeing burke and dulles telling me all i had to do was sign on the dotted line
the invasion would succeed
castro would be gone
just like that
the president is rendered mute by a wave of pain
kenny and bobby aver their eyes
when it passes the president is hushed grave
immoral about abandoning your own judgement
kenny nods moved
the president reaches out for the reconnaissance photos bobbys flipping through
bobby hands them to him
the president looks them over
and when he speaks theres humility
we cant let things get ahead of themselves
weve got to control what happens
were going to do what we have to make this come out right
excom is our first weapon
beat well resort to others as we need em
a long shot of an enormous crowd thronging a bunting trimmed platform
the president barely recognizable at the distance and a cluster of political vips wave from it smiling
kenny steps into frame back here at the fringes of the crowd
doesnt anybody in connecticut have to work today
the crowd goes nuts
kenny paces checks his watch impatient to be done with the necessary diversion
kenny gazes off to his right and spots scotty reston along with half the white house press corps suckered along
scotty catches kennys look
kenny turns away but scotty comes weaving over
the president continues on but all we hear is scotty and kenny
they didnt let me up front said the president was on the phone the whole time
who was he talking to
come on odonnell everyones wondering whats going on
whats acheson doing in town
and dont give me some bullshit about dnc think tanks
why dont you ask him yourself
you can have him on the way home
im giving you a chance here talk to me
you can influence how this thing unfolds
but kenny stands there mute
reston just shakes his head knowing for sure somethings up
he turns and heads back for the press corps
kenny and the president climb the stairs to the presidential plane the crowd cheering him
he gives a final wave
lets get out of here
cheer up youve neutralized the entire white house press corps for a day
excom meets in george balls small conference room at the state department
bobby in shirtsleeves paces at the head of the table very very alone
all eyes are on him
there is more than one option here
if one isnt occurring to us its because we havent thought hard enough
the others react in frustration
cia chief john mccone sharp tough conservative is harsh
sometimes there is only one right choice and you thank god when its clear
youre talking about a sneak attack
howll that make us look
big country blasting a little one into the stone age
well be real favorites around the world
bobby thats naive
this is the real world you know that better than anybody
your argument is ridiculous
you werent so ethically particular when we were talking about options for removing castro over at cia
and theres nothing bobby can say to that
he props himself up on the table stares at it as if theres an answer in its shiny surface somewhere
there is only the reflection of his own face
i cant let my brother go down in history like a villain like a tojo ordering another pearl harbor
mccone acheson and taylor share a look
the last resistance to airstrikes is crumbling
finally bobby looks up at mcnamara
if we go ahead with these air strikes
beat theres got to be something else
give it to me
i dont care how crazy inadequate or stupid it sounds
beat pleading give it to me
mcnamara suffers under the gaze of everyone at the table weighing the situation out
and finally he ventures
six months ago we gamed out a scenario
it doesnt get rid of the missiles
there are a lot of drawbacks
beat the scenario was for a blockade of cuba
kenny enters the office from his side door in the middle of a debate
military uniforms dominate the room general taylor general sweeney and a host of briefing officers
the situation is worse than we thought
we count missiles now longer range irbms
they can hit every city in the continental u
the president stares out the window at the rose garden his back to air force chief of staff general curtis lemay
beetle browed arrogant the archetypal cold war general
yet there is something about him his intelligence perhaps that suggests hes playing a role he knows and believes in
the only other civilians in the room are bobby bundy and mcnamara
the pressure from the military is almost physical
president as of this moment my planes are ready to carry out the air strikes
all you have to do is give me the word sir and my boys will get those red bastards
the president continues staring out the window
kenny eases over to the desk leans on it arms folded interposing himself between the president and the soldiers
bobby joins him side by side
how long until the army is ready
weve just begun the mobilization under cover of a pre arranged exercise sir
were looking at another week and a half mr
but you can begin the strikes now
the plans call for an eight day air campaign
itd light a fire under the armys ass to get in place
that makes the president turn around stare at lemay
general lemay do you truly believe thats our best course of action
president i believe it is the only course of action
american is in danger
those missiles are a threat to our bomber bases and the safety of our nuclear deterrent
without our deterrent theres nothing to keep the enemy from choosing general nuclear war
its our duty our responsibility to the american people to take out those missiles and return stability to the strategic situation
the big red dog is digging in our back yard and were justified in shooting him
taylor steps in softly smoothly good cop to lemays bad
sir we have a rapidly closing window of opportunity where we can prevent those missiles from ever becoming operational
the other options
he spares a look at mcnamara who watches the fireworks arms folded serious
do not guarantee the end result we can guarantee
however the more time that goes by the less reliable the choice we can offer you becomes
the president partially defused looks from taylor to mcnamara
lemay steps forward softer now sincere
president the motto i chose for sac is peace is our profession
god forbid we find ourselves in a nuclear exchange
but if launched those missiles in cuba would kill a lot of americans
thats why im being such a pain in the ass about destroying them
destroying them immediately
hell even mac agrees
bundy is uncomfortable
everyone turns to him
kenny realizes hes been co opted by the military
mcnamara does too lets out a deep breath
the president eyes bundy then paces out from behind his desk walks up to lemay
general what will the soviets do when we attack
kenny bobby and the president look at each other unable to believe what they just heard
because the only alternative open to them is one they cant choose
his pronouncement hangs there in the air ominous dangerous
those arent just missiles well be destroying
we kill soviet soldiers and they will respond
how would we respond if they killed ours
no they will do something general i promise you that
and i believe itll be berlin
lemay walk out of the oval office with taylor carter and their staffers
those goddamn kennedys are going to destroy this country if we dont do something about this
there are dark looks on the faces of the other officers
as the meeting next door disperses the president rummages through kennys jacket which hangs on kennys chair
kenny bemused holds out the package of cigarettes the president is looking for
i was hoping lemay pushed you
i wouldnt mind going a few rounds with him
the president glances up takes the proffered smokes
we knew it was coming
i tell you kenny these brass hats have one big advantage
we do what they want us to none of us will be alive to tell em they were wrong
bobby rusk and sorensen enter from the hall
president gromyko should be on his way by now
we need to go over what youre going to say
theres still no sign they know that we know about the missiles
been a lot of cloud cover probably think we arent getting any good product
we keep em in the dark as long as we can
but i sure as hell am going to test him
kenny comes out of the bathroom and is buttonholed by the crewcut bullet headed press secretary pierre salinger in the crowded busy hallway
kenny im getting funny questions from the guys in the press office
as press secretary i need to know
whats going on
kenny wheels back into his office
its filled with people
but he bends confidentially to pierres ear
theyre planning to shave you bald next time you fall asleep on the bus
off pierres get serious look sorry pierre gromyko just arrived
the press corps throngs kennys tiny office pushing and shoving for a vantage at the side door to the oval office waiting for the gromyko photo op
kenny stands shoulder to shoulder with reston and sorensen near the door
are they going to discuss the military exercises going on in florida
kenny doesnt even blink but sorensen does a poorer job at hiding his reaction
come on scotty
this meetings been on the books for months
its just a friendly talk on u
fortunately the conversation is cut short as a dozen flashbulbs suddenly go off on a dozen cameras as the reporters crush in on the oval office and reston is swept
over the reporters
the president unsmiling enters the room beside soviet foreign minister andrei gromyko
gromyko pauses for the photos grim dark haired saturnine
at last the face of the enemy
the camera picks up the darkened windows the meeting has gone long
the camera moves past kenny and sorensen standing in the doorway to kennys office finds the president in his chair across from gromyko on the sofa
rusk ambassador anatoly dobrinyn and two interpreters around them
so that there should be no misunderstanding the position of the united states which has been made clear by the attorney general to ambassador dobrynin here i shall read a
sentence from my own statement to the press dated september th
beat reading should missiles or offensive weapons be placed in cuba it would present the gravest threat to u
the president stares at gromyko as the translator finishes translating
gromyko sits there enigmatic cold unreadable
the translator finishes and gromyko stops him with a gesture so he can answer in his own accented english
president this will never be done
you need not be concerned
the president hides his fury masterfully and gazing over his glasses asks so i do not misunderstand you there are no offensive weapons in cuba
and gromykos response is flat sure steady no mr
we have sent defensive weapons only to cuba
kennys blazing eyes could drill holes in the back of gromykos head
his gaze swings to the presidents desk
beneath the desk sit the briefing boards with the evidence
kenny emerges from his office
the soviet delegation disappears down the hallway with rusk
kenny turns as bobby haggard comes up from the other direction
bobby gestures to the vanishing delegation now being harangued oc by the press
the president comes out of the next door down the hall the oval office
he turns and sees kenny and bobby
lied to my face
were split down the middle
if i held a vote i think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two
i want a consensus bobby
either air strike or blockade
something everyonell stand by even if they dont like it
i need it by saturday
make it happen
what if i cant
we go into this split the russians will know it
and theyll use it against us
the prospect disturbs the three men
have you cancelled chicago and the rest of the weekend yet
you dont show for chicago everyonell know theres something going on
i dont care
the president spins on him unsure he heard correctly
im not calling and cancelling on daly
you call and cancel on daly
youre scared to cancel on daly
damn right im scared
the president pauses looks at bobby
bobby shakes his head dont look at me
well im not
then youll call right
kenny threads his way through the host of secret service agents and advance man cramming the hallway on the floor of the hotel theyve taken over
from one of the rooms emerges salinger
kenny all right
whats going on here
theres rumors going around an exercise in the southeast is related to cuba
im the press secretary
i cant do my job if i dont know whats going on
so whats going on
what are you telling them
the truth i dont know
deadly serious tell em youve looked into it and all it is is an exercise
and pierre beat loaded the president may have a cold tomorrow
kenny stares at him and the light dawns on pierre
something big is going on and hes been cut out of it
he stalks off
damn it kenny
a big dollar a plate dinner is in full swing to a dinner bands tunes
the president and chicago mayor richard daly make the rounds among the fund raising crowd
kenny follows them at a respectful distance greeting old cronies
suddenly a messenger hustles over to kenny hands him a note
kenny makes eye contact with the president nods and leaves
kenny waits at the elevator
scotty saunters up behind him
he sizes kenny up clears his throat
kenny turns around
there are major rail disruptions in the south two airborne divisions are on alert
that exercise is an invasion
well you know how bobby has it in for the state of mississippi
this is about cuba
kenny freezes then explodes
youre fucking crazy
we are not invading cuba
nobody gives a rats ass about cuba
not now not ever
if you print something like that all youre going to do is inflame the situation
nobody talks to assholes who inflame situations
assholes like that can find themselves cut out of the loop
reston is taken aback
stung silence for a beat
kennys response is far louder than any yes
now kenny realizes it
youve never threatened me before
and kenny looks away upset but when he turns back to reston all thats there is his poker face
the elevator arrives
im not going to print anything until i have another source
but i promise you ill get one
kenny boards the elevator
the doors shut on scotty
kenny closes his eyes sags against the wall hating himself
kenny enters his hotel room
an assistant waits with the phone hands it straight to kenny
to assistant tell pierre i need to talk to him
to phone bobby
excom files past bobby out of george balls conference room
bring him back
the president emerges from the hotel a hat on his head
the press and a crowd surge forward crying out for the presidents attention
kenny slides into the limo first as the president waves to the crowd
salinger waits on the sidewalk and after the limo pulls away the press pushes in on him
pierres face is pale hes just been told everything
the president has a cold
he is cancelling the remainder of this trip and is returning to washington on the advice of his doctor
the white house oval room opulent filled with priceless art and furniture but cramped
excom members crowd around the center coffee table and the president
kenny stands behind him with bobby
rusk rises from his seat formal
president our deliberations have led us to the conclusion that for the moment a blockade of offensive weapons to cuba is our best option
but well still need a strong showing of support from the organization of american states to give us an umbrella of legitimacy
at long last
kenny looks at bobby relieved
theyve bought time to find a settlement
bobby smiles a small smile what were you so worried about
a blockade is technically an act of war therefore we recommend calling the action a quarantine
mcnamara folder in hand opens it smash cutting us to a soviet freighter churning its way south
there are between and soviet ships underway to cuba at this time
the camera races along its side discovering tarpulined objects on deck and on its stack the red hammer and sickle
miles out the navy will stop them board and any vessels containing weapons will be turned back
the destroyer u
pierce putting out to sea sailors racing over its deck through hatches to its inch gun turrets
the ship races by american flag streaming from its stern distaff filling the screen wiping to the president
he listens looks over the briefing papers as mcnamara continues
everyone watches the president
a quarantine prevents more missiles from reaching cuba but it doesnt remove the ones already there
it gives the soviets a chance to pull back without war
if they refuse to remove the missiles before theyre operational we retain the option to strike or invade
we believe that a surprise attack would be counter to what the united states stands for
we believe that an attack leaves us no room for maneuver and the inevitable soviet response will force us into a war we do not want
a war that this time will really end all war
president there are still those of us who believe we should proceed with the strikes
with the blockade we lose strategic surprise and we run the risk of a first strike if the soviets decide they have to use the missiles or lose them
the president gazes from one expectant face to another
but he himself remains unreadable
quarantine or air strike
adlai clears his throat
everyone looks over at him
he stares down at his clasped hands for a beat
hes anguished about what hes going to say
there is a third option
with either course we undertake the risk of nuclear war
it seems to me maybe one of us in here should be a coward
he smiles weakly but gets no response from anyone
so i guess ill be
our third choice is to cut a deal
we trade guantanamo and our missiles in turkey get them to pull their missiles out
we employ a back channel attribute the idea to u thant
u thant then raises it at the u
adlai looks for support around the room but meets only stony gazes
from mccone and general taylor contempt
dead silence for a long long beat
kennys heart goes out to stevenson as he watches the man commit political suicide
even sorensen standing behind him unconsciously moves away
at last the president speaks
i dont think thats possible adlai
beat to the room i will be asking the networks for air time monday night
i have not yet made my final decision
we will announce our course of action then
i want to thank you all for your advice gentlemen
kenny bobby and the president lean on the railing of the truman balcony stare out at the city
peace at any price
youd think nobody learned anything from world war two
somebody had to say it
i respect adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser
we have to pull him
hes not going to be able to handle the soviets in front of the u
zorin will eat him alive
weve got bigger problems right now
we have to try the blockades
it probably wont work
it may just be delaying the inevitable
but we cant just go to war without trying not to
i dont know
i dont know
he stares out at the ellipse where a little league football game sweeps across the grass the shouts and screams of the children so alive floating to them on the
a crowded d
party spills out of jim rowes house onto his patio
kenny steps into frame
he looks at the partygoers the washington social set
he stands out oppressed by the knowledge hes unable to share
he takes a stiff drink
suddenly out of the house totters adlai highball in hand
glassy eyed he grins at kenny and joins him
just cant get away from you guys
escaping for a night on the town eh
as the towns most popular playboy the president felt my presence would be sorely missed
so in the interests of national security
adlai takes a long drink closes his eyes
gotta keep up appearances
of course i dont care anymore
im a political dead man
you ever seen a man cut his own throat like i did today
kenny has no answer to that
he looks down pained for adlai
well its all right
beat i came to tell you just talked to a friend
reston and frankel have the story
its going to run tomorrow
kenny shut in the bedroom paces on the phone
were not going to make it to monday
ill try to lean on reston but youre going to have to call orville dryfoos
this is the sort of decision the publisher makes himself
new york times publisher orville dryfoos sits at his kitchen table in his underwear still half asleep phone to his ear
yes sir i understand
but we held on bay of pigs and it was the biggest mistake of my life
what makes this any different
the president on the phone stops pacing by his bedside table and exhales
im asking you to hold the story until i can present our course of action on monday night
but i need a reason to give my boys
theyre going to be screaming for my head on a plate
i want you to tell them this theyll be saving lives
maybe even including their own
at that dryfoos sits up
all resistance gone
ave maria soars over the communion meditation at a crowded sunday mass
kenny in a pew glances off to his left
the president sits nearby head bowed
but kenny knows hes not thinking about the mass
and when the president at last lifts his head kenny sees the calm poise
the president has made up his mind
bobby barges into kennys office
kenny knowing his unique entry doesnt bother to look up
acheson called degaulles with us havent heard from anyone else yet
kenny finally looks up
and an icicle forms in kennys gut as bobby relays
he wants to talk to lemay again
kenny bobby mcnamara rusk bundy and half of excom stand to the side of the room
general sweeney and lemay stand in front of the presidents desk
the president bowed in the window is care worn a thousand years old
the shadow the composition of the shot tells us all
its down to whats in the heart of one man
kenny is deeply moved at his friends gethsemane
cam can you guarantee me youll get all the missiles
sweeney glances at lemay
lemays stern frozen look wills him to say very simply yes
but then the president turns around looks sweeney in the eye
it would make machiavelli himself tell the truth
sir i can guarantee well get all the missiles we know about
the president holds sweeney in his gaze
president we can get better than ninety percent of them
the president doesnt respond to lemays last ditch appeal
ninety percent isnt good enough with nuclear weapons
he moves to his desk signs a paper hands it to general sweeney
as of seven oclock monday night all united states armed forces world wide will stand up to defcon
a deafening whine
and into frame yawns the enormous spinning mouth of a b bomber jet engine
it closes on us sucking us in like a maelstrom but at the last second the carrying us over the aircrafts wing
the camera pivots and the vast war machine crawls away underneath joining a long line of identical behemoths in single file inching down a taxi way which vanishes into the
as the planes immense vertical tail wipes our view the camera races toward a spotlighted concrete emplacement over the immense blast door which is sliding open and down into the
depths of a missile silo
the camera speeds down the side of the titan missile through clouds of steaming liquid hydrogen past fueling hoses which clamp one by one to the rockets side past gantry
arms pulling away
the camera hurtles all the way to the bottom smashing through the floor the dark ocean whitecaps whipping luminous around the aircraft carrier u
essex and her escorts
running lights flash red and green
the carriers siren begins a lonely eerie woop woop woop woop like some immense creature which has lost its mind
the ship fills the screen cutting us into the doors to the cabinet room
then they swing wide
the president emerges livid fury on his face leaving chaos behind the congressional briefing
kenny comes out a beat later catches up with him
youd worry that something was wrong if congress offered you unconditional support
they want this fucking job they can have it
its no great joy to me
the president exhales getting control
the elected representatives of the people have spoken
beat determined now lets tell the people
kenny stands there in the doorway arms folded
as we pull away from him we reveal the three network t
cameras staring straight at us
their red lights go on as one and we swing around reversing to the president at his desk telegenic powerful
good evening my fellow citizens
this government as promised has maintained the closest surveillance of the soviet military build up on the island of cuba
the first b trundles to a stop at the end of the runway
it begins to throttle up the roar of its engine mounting
unmistakable evidence has now established the fact that a series of missile sites is in preparation on that imprisoned island
the purpose of these bases can be none other than to proved a nuclear strike capability against the western hemisphere
and drowning out the presidents speech as the plane lurches forward down the runway into the night
the titan solo door grinds open
and the missile inside begins to rise into the white bath of the crossed spotlights
therefore in the defense of our own security and under the authority of the constitution i have directed that the following initial steps be taken
first to halt this offensive build up a strict quarantine the presidents words conjure the essex battlegroup its destroyers plunging through heavy seas lit up in the night
on all offensive military equipment under shipment to cuba is being initiated
all ships of any kind bound for cuba if found to contain cargoes of offensive weapons will be turned back
second i have directed the continued and increased close surveillance of cuba and its military build up
should these offensive military preparations continue further action will be justified a flight of f phantoms drops into frame lights flashing
i have directed the armed forces to prepare for any eventualities
and the president looks up from his notes
and third it shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear missile launched from cuba against any nation in the western hemisphere as an attack by the
soviet union on the united states requiring a full retaliatory response upon the soviet union
the chilling words hang there in the air
bleeding in the rising and falling woop woop woop woop which becomes the voice of the essex battlegroup sparkling alive a constellation of lights scattered across the sea
one by one the escort ships answer the carriers siren with their own wailing cries an alien chorus among the ships disappearing and reappearing in the swells
the communication crescendos to its fever pitch and then the battlegroup goes to blackout
like a dying universe the answering sirens cut off the life lights wink out and an appalling darkness falls across the sea
blackness like before a curtain rises
and then a flickering a fluorescent light comes on
kenny stripped to the waist sorensen and bundy shave in nearby sinks
bobby barges in
were getting the soviet response
specks of shaving cream still on his face kenny paces reads the inky carbon as bobby bundy and sorensen read copies
this is all rhetoric
realizing they dont know how to respond yet
kenny looks up
the president enters from the oval office
so now youre khurschev
what do you do
kenny arms folded stands behind the president the rest of excom is looking at him
run the blockade
theyll run the blockade
admiral george anderson s dapper the chief of naval operations nods from the far end of the table
which is exactly what they appear to be preparing to do mr
were tracking ships inbound to cuba
theres no sign theyre changing course
the closest ships the gagarin and the kimovsk will make the quarantine line by this time tomorrow
were concerned about the possibility of an incident with an innocent cargo carrier
if it turns ugly the russians could use an ugly incident and bad world opinion as leverage to force us to remove the quarantine
or they could use it as an excuse to escalate
admiral anderson if the ships do not stop what exactly are our rules of engagement
anderson signals a briefing officer who hits the lights and an overhead projector which smash cuts to the bridge of the u
john pierce a gearing class destroyer
a radio operator addresses a mike in russian
russian speakers have been transferred to all of our ships
once the quarantine takes effect in the morning our ships will attempt to make radio contact with the approaching vessels
they will be ordered to reduce speed and prepare for inspection
marines in flak jackets grab m s off a rack race by
a ships boat full of marines lowers away hits the water engine spraying as it launches forward in dress rehearsal
an inspection party will then board and search the ship
if weapons are found the ship will be ordered to leave the quarantine area or be towed into port upon refusal
all eyes are on admiral andersons overhead projections
bobby restless gets up begins pacing
what happens if the ship doesnt stop for inspection or want to be towed
a warning shot will be fired across its bow
bobby stops stares directly at the admiral
and what happens if the ship ignores the warning shot
then we fire at its rudder disable it and carry out the inspection
kenny looks at the president who remains unmoved unreadable
there will be no shooting without my explicit orders
is that understood
the president glances at mcnamara
well admiral it looks like its up to the navy
the navy wont let you down sir
general have we developed any more information on the missiles
they are continuing to proceed with the development
were commencing low level photography runs this morning
the pictures will be used to firm up our estimates of the missiles readiness and develop target packages for strikes should you order them
our guy running this show is the best
commander bill ecker of the navys vfp the fightin photo
something of a character but the highest efficiency ratings weve ever had
he pushes eckers personnel file across the table and as the president opens it on eckers photo we smash cut to the man himself commander bill ecker s playing cards
smoking cigars with his wingman lieutenant bruce wilhemy and the pilots of vfp the fightin photo
they lounge tinker with equipment
their ready room is filled with pin ups movie posters and all things photographic
millimeter im listening
on the big screen theres nothing like it
the other pilots heckle him but are muted by taylor
to protect our pilots were prepared to retaliate against any sam site or anti aircraft battery that opens fire
watch out hollywood
theres a new epic director in town
excom listens in sober silence
we have a flight of thunderchiefs able to respond within minutes of an attack on our planes
kenny catches the presidents eye
kenny glances at the door
step outside i need to talk to you
the president and kenny stand in front of the presidents desk
all the doors are shut
weak sunlight filters into the hushed room as if to a confessional
i dont like whats happening
in the morning im taking charge of the blockade from the situation room
mcnamarall set up shop in the flag plot at the pentagon keep an eye on things there
cause you get armed boarders climbing into soviet ships shots being fired across bows
i know i know
what about these low level flights
theyre starting in what
do you realize what youre letting yourself in for
we need those flights
we have to know when those missiles become operational because when they do we need to destroy them
but castros on alert and were flying attack planes over their sites on the deck
theres no way for them to know theyre carrying cameras not bombs
theyre going to be shot at plain and simple
kennys right and the president looks away in frustration
im your political advisor and im giving you political analysis here
this is a setup
the chiefs want to go in
its the only way they can redeem themselves for the bay of pigs
they have to go in and they have to do it right
its that simple
im gonna protect those pilots
thep president stares intently at kenny
kenny glances at the door his voice hushed
theyre boxing us in with these rules of engagement
if you agree to em and one of our planes gets knocked down or one of the ships wont stop for inspection the chiefs will have us by the balls
and will force us to start shooting
they want a war and theyre arranging things to get one
if you dont want one we have to do something about it
the president understands
he shakes his head paces away
how does a man get to a place where he can say throw those lives away so easily
maybe its harder for them to say it than they let on
at the very least they believe its in our best interest
and at the end of the day they may end up being right
the president turns away considers
then turns back
triple check everything the chiefs say to us with the guys who actually have to do it
no ones to know about this but bobby
i need redundant control over what happens out there
and if things arent as advertised youre going to make sure they come out the way i want them to come out starting with this low level flight thing
kenny is daunted
for a beat he just stares
thats going to be tough
you know how these guys are about their chains of command
any problems you remind them those chains of commands end at one place
kenny and the president head for the cabinet room
rusk comes out before they get there
the oas meeting starts in an hour
i havent prepared at all
we cant expect we need this one dean
the quarantines legal if we get a mandate otherwise its an act of war in the eyes of the world
get me that vote
make it unanimous
president the organization of american states hasnt had a unanimous vote since the president moves for the cabinet room
kenny slaps the dismayed rusk on the back heads off down a hall away from the cabinet room
kenny opens the door to the white house switchboard room
a half dozen operators work their lines making connections on the old fashioned switchboard
unnoticed he sizes them up their skill
theyre all courteous pretty professional
the camera pans down the line
and stops on a middle aged matron at the end the sternest most scary of them all
her name is margaret
white house operator
beat harsh booming speaker mccormack hold for the vice president
her voice is so severe so smoker gravelled it makes the blood run cold
this is the woman kennys looking for
maam would you mind helping me out with a few special calls
ecker wilhemy and their pilots are in angry debate
orson welles is a hack
now you want to talk about a director you talk about david lean
welles is a g d
leans the hack
bullshit bruce nobody but lean is making decent movies these days
to young pilot get that fixed yet
nearby a young pilot tinkers with a spy camera
suddenly the door opens and a pale duty sergeant enters
ecker enters marches over to the phone
all the soldiers in the room stare at him
ecker wiggles his cigar to a corner of his mouth picks up styling
vfp fightin photo here
but what we really want to do is direct
margaret works her magic
this is the white house operator
hold for the president
ecker blinks becomes a mild lamb
honey you dont know what shit is
kenny sitting on his desk taps his fingers looks at the phone
hes kept ecker on hold long enough and picks up
commander my name is ken odonnell
special assistant to the president
its not the president but ecker is so shaken up it might as well be
the president has instructed me to pass along an order to you
beat you are not to get shot down
did he hear right
well do our best sir
i dont think you understand me correctly
you are not to get shot down under any circumstances
whatever happens up there you were not shot at
mechanical failures are fine crashing into mountains fine
but you and your men are not to be shot at fired at launched upon
ecker sits down in a chair sobered
excuse me sir whats going on here
kenny stands drops the hard nose bullshit
commander if you are fired upon the president will be forced to attack the sites that fire on you
he doesnt want to have to do that
its very important that he doesnt or things could go very badly out of control
ecker lets out a long breath
i think i understand
what about my men
if it comes up hot and heavy and we dont have anyone to protect us
im going to be writing letters to parents
i hate writing letters to parents
kenny nods to himself feeling
hes done it himself
if the president protects you commander he may have to do it with the bomb
ecker doesnt want to be avenged with atomic weapons
no sane person would
ive known the man for fifteen years
the problem is he will protect you
so im asking dont make him protect you
dont get shot at
ecker down deeply affected
suddenly a bell rings
a teletype goes off
ecker knows its for him
well do what we can
as ecker hangs up the duty officer rips off the orders hands them to ecker who takes one look then gazes out the window at the runway a cart speeds
down the flight line past the waiting f u p corsairs
one by one the four pilots accompanying ecker and wilhemy jump off to mount their planes
the cart still moving
get that fuel assayed
aint for high performance babies like ours
shoulda brought some from home but what can you do
last second deployments
wilhemy jumps off then theyre at eckers plane and he jumps off
too late to worry about bad fuel now
he hoists himself up and into the cockpit of the sleek navy jet
as the canopy closes ecker powers up the engines talks to his flight over the guard channel
okay time to play spin the bottle with our bearded buddy
nobody gets out ahead
remember just sitting here were only ten minutes from target
the crusaders swing around in pairs at one end of the runway and then the first two throttle up flaps down and drop their brakes
the machines lunge forward like duelling drag racers
the fill the screen blow past
the six crusaders in pairs streak over the buildings and streets of key west
and in a heartbeat cross the beach and are out to sea
and already on the horizon the low clouds and dark line of land
ninety miles away
the ocean shrieks past so close you can see the white foam
ecker checks the altimeter feet
a small fishing boat looms ahead its net booms reaching up like tree limbs
the crusader rockets over it
ecker checks his instruments
out the window the other crusaders thunder over the water past sailboats cabin cruisers the small craft traffic outside key west
the speed sucks the breath away
go to military throttle on my mark
his airspeed indicator spins up to knots
and then his radio suddenly crackles flameout flameout
get some altitude
two of the crusaders pull up away from the water
oh god damn
got it restarted
sir i dont think shes gonna hold up for the run
you two get out of here
the two planes with bad fuel pull wingovers to their left head for the airfield in the distance
the four remaining planes streak over the ocean
there are no more small craft this far out in the strait
cuba green and hazy looms in the window
ecker throws a series of switches
start your camera checks
a mechanical whine accompanies the switch throwing
ecker pulls the trigger on his joystick and a thump thump thump hammers away
there are green lights across his boards
one of the other pilots cuts in on the radio failure
film must not have fed
i just shot it all boss
activator jammed open its exposing everything now
thats alright lenny it happens to most men at some time ecker grimaces but his voice stays cool
scrub you two
get out of here
still with me bruce
the two crusaders whove failed their camera checks break off
and now cubas hills the havana sky line are right in front of them
the last two crusaders streak over the surf a white wake of spray in their jetwash and cross the beach with a boom
the planes dip and rise with the green tropical contours taking us on a sickening roller coaster ride over cuban countryside at treetop level
palm forest roads can fields more palm forest race by
and then ahead a large clearing
warm em up
cuban anti aircraft gunners shout as they traverse their mm guns in their sandbagged emplacement
the low rippling thunder of the incoming jets becomes an earsplitting roar
and the crusaders blast out over the clearing
the anti aircraft guns open up
wilhemy jinks left to avoid a streaking of tracer fire
tracers and flack pepper the air in front of eckers crusader
metal pings tinks rattles off the fuselage
anti aircraft and small arms fire comes up from all over hitting the planes multiple times
he surveys the shapes in the target zone dead ahead
and sees the long canvas covered objects on the ground
they draw closer
a steel fragment cracks his window obscuring our view
and he thumbs the camera switch
all twelve b system cameras begin banging away like cannons
tracers lace the air between the two planes as they blast over the missile site
and then theyre out over forest again
its all over in seconds
the triple a stops
in unison the two planes bank right heading for the distant blue blue sea
kenny paces by the phone
he picks up listens reacts
and we know the planes have made it back
ecker jumps down from the cockpit ladder and turns an eye to his battered pock marked plane
wilhemy and the ground crew chief come running up the chief letting out a whistle
lookit what daddy done brung home
you shoulda seen it chief they damn sparrows
mustve been migrating
guess i hit a couple hundred
to wilhemy stern how many did you hit bruce
wilhemy stands there looking at ecker not sure what to make of him
the crew chief just starts laughing as more impressed ground crew come up
was them or million sparrows
ecker sweat plastered and foul steps into the chiefs face
those are bird strikes
sparrows to be precise
got a problem with that
the chief stands there glances at the plane one more time and shakes his head no
ecker takes the chiefs maintenance clipboard from him writes in big bold marker bird strikes
he thrusts it back into the chiefs hands and walks off the astonished wilhemy remains behind
in kennys credenza a small black and white t
walter cronkite narrates on the television as a train laden with tanks on flatbeds pulls out of a station
massive military preparations are underway throughout the southeast in what pentagon officials are confirming is the largest mobilization since korea
the railways have been nationalized to assist in the deployment here transporting elements of the u
st armored division from ft
a phone rings
kenny turns from the t
turns down walter cronkite as he answers
george ball stands at the back of a crowded room filled with applauding oas delegates
its for rusk at a podium up front
the vote just came down
kenny opens his door lets rusk in
the president bobby and half of excom look up
rusk stands there somber
and then he breaks into a huge grin
everyone cheers him
about time something went our way
an assistant enters behind kenny
kenny senses him turns as the others move to shake hands with rusk
kenny grinning ducks back into his office closes the door after the assistant leaves
he picks up the phone
ecker stands at a phone stares out a window at a replacement plane being fueled
a crusader not his shot up one
odonnell ive been ordered to deliver the film to the pentagon personally
whats going on
kenny thinks fast
the chiefs must want to talk to you
beat listen to me commander theyll want to know if you were fired on
you could say that sir
do not under any circumstances tell the chiefs
super e ring
then super the pentagon ecker still in his sweat drenched flight suit approaches a security checkpoint
guards secure his sidearm and user him through a doorway
a sign over it reads jcs
the door swings open into the joint chiefs sound proofed briefing room known as the tank
lemay taylor and anderson sit there around the table
commander william b
ecker reporting as ordered
lemay rises prowls over to ecker
son i want to know just one thing
those bastards shoot so much as a bb gun at you
a long beat
sweat runs off eckers head
he can smell lemays breath
sir it was a milk run sir
kenny joins the president and general taylor in the hallway as they head for the oval office
it appears our low level flights are getting back okay
some unconfirmed reports of small arms fire from some of the missions but thats it
slightly behind them kenny looks sidelong at taylor
guess we cant blame khruschev for a few patriotic farmers
and the ships
still heading for cuba
then i guess its time
flashbulbs go off all around the room as the president walks in goes over to his desk
reporters observe silently t
cameras track him kenny bobby and sorensen watch as the president sits takes a pen form his pocket
in accordance with this afternoons vote at the oas the quarantine shall hereby be effective as of ten oclock tomorrow morning
kenny observes in silence as the president signs the proclamation of interdiction
the oval office has emptied out
only kenny bobby sorensen and the president remain
the president looks out the window sorensen sits in a chair in front of the desk
bobby and kenny sit on the edge of the desk
last summer i read a book
the guns of august
i wish every man on that blockade line had read that book
the president moves over to the globe by his desk spins it stopping in on europe
world war one
thirteen million killed all because the militaries of both alliances were so highly attuned to each others movements and dispositions afraid of letting the other guy have a theoretical advantage
and your man in the field his family at home couldnt even tell you the reasons why their lives were being sacrificed
beat why couldnt they stop it
the presidents fingers turn the globe
it stops on north america
kenny and bobby listen
and here we are fifty years later
one of their ships resists the inspection
we shoot out its rudder and board
they shoot down our planes in response
we bomb their anti aircraft sites in response to that
they attack berlin
we invade cuba
they fire their missiles
we fire ours
the president sets the globe gently spinning and walks away
kenny rubs his eyes listens to his phone and the womans voice at the other end
its his wife
when are you going to be home
i dont know helen
i want you to keep the kids close tomorrow
leave the t
on sleep with it on in the bedroom until i tell you you can turn it off
nothing you dont know about
tomorrows the big day
just have the car ready to go if i call or if the civil defense warning comes on
what happens to you
im not leaving without you
ill be evacuated with the president
a long silence on the other end of the line
so while youre under a rock somewhere with the president what am i supposed to do with your five children
and to that there is no answer
a beat and its all kenny can promise ill find you
but were not going to let it come to that
kenny hands bobby and bundy cups of coffee
the three men nurse them in the silence of the abandoned cafeteria
helen just asked me what sort of arrangements we have for the families
i just checked myself
beat theyre being issued identity cards
call comes and evacuation officers meet them at pre arranged departure areas
they go by helicopter to mount weather
we meet them there
bobby looks at his coffee then up at kenny
he gently shakes his head
its all a sham
course thats for morale
the missiles only take five minutes to get here
kenny bolts upright from his couch
he rubs his face sits on the edge in the dark for a beat
hes not going back to sleep
he grabs his trousers
kenny makes his way through the dim deserted halls
somewhere in the distance a phone rings
he reaches a door
kenny bundled in an overcoat steps outside the north entrance
the cool air invigorates him
he eyes the fence pennsylvania avenue beyond it seeming to isolate this world from the living city beyond
he starts for the main gate
a white house police officer jumps up as kenny approaches
would you like me to call a car mr
kenny checks his watch
how long will it take to get someone up
fifteen minutes maybe
to your house sir
kenny considers shakes his head
he wants to go home but
no ill let her sleep
let em sleep
kenny says it with a certain finality
the police officer nods and kenny wanders out through the gates shouldering the weight of the world
kenny makes his way down a sidewalk not far from the white house
a hour drug stores doors are open
inside a knot of people late night deliverymen a cop the store employees talk in undertones at the counter
behind it a t
is signing off with the national anthem
sober voices sober looks
kenny moves on
a cluster of college students talk at a news stand
theyre waiting for the newsie to cut the bands of the next days washington post the bundles just being thrown to the sidewalk from the delivery truck
in their thing beards counter culture clothes the kids seem so young kenny so old
kenny buys a newspaper its dire headlines every story about the crisis
kenny newspaper under his arm continues down the street
up ahead the lights are on in a catholic church
lines of churchgoers are at the door
kenny stops surprised at the sight this late
and then he sees the hand painted banner kenny is moved
he glances over his shoulder and then
joins the line himself
kennys watch reads one minute til ten oclock
pull back to kenny standing just inside the open doors to the white house situation room a state of the art conference room
a long central table surrounded by leather chairs with phones and screens built in
monitors hang from the ceilings in the corners
there are no windows just oppressive bunker like walls
its far underground
across the room the president paces phone in hand
half of excom is in their seats
the other half along with a steady stream of duty officers are coming and going
kenny steps aside for a duty officer listens to the president
okay bob im putting you on intercom
suddenly mcnamaras voice fills the room
hey guys can you hear me
mcnamara stands phone in hand
i have one minute til ten here a large elaborate war room like mission control
big screens plexiglass tracking boards tiered banks of communications equipment
a massive light table on the floor at the center of the room projects a map of the caribbean and atlantic
arcing across it is a red line the blockade
the map is covered with cryptic military notations watch officers on a platform which swings out over it update the latest ship positions
mcnamaras in a booth overlooking the room
its open to the next tier below where admiral anderson is giving orders
and no sign of them stopping
kenny and bobby move to the presidents end of the table sit down across from each other in mirror image fashion
excom looks to the president
the second hand of the clock on the wall wheels past
a hush falls over the room
bob the quarantine is now in effect
mcnamara is mute for a beat
he turns to view the big room
then it looks like our first customers are the gagarin and kimovsk
he nods to admiral anderson who calls an order down to a watch officer on the floor and on screens all around the room a sector of the map magnifies
the unfolding encounter between the destroyer u
pierce and the soviet freighters gagarin and kimovsk
the pierces bridge wings are crammed with helmeted officers and lookouts
they peer through binoculars at the distant ships plowing ahead straight for them
the captain lowers his binoculars determined
helm shape heading for intercept zero one zero
all ahead full new contact
everyone whirls to the bridge
the captain steps forward
the captain ducks into the cic
the chief sonaran reports
submerged contact designation sierra one at yards bearing
the president reacts
kenny and bobby react
its protecting the freighters
the president picks up the phone
bob is there any way we can avoid stopping a submarine first
im afraid not mr
the sub has positioned itself between the pierce and the soviet ships
admiral anderson insists its too much of a risk to proceed with stopping the freighters
the pierce would be a sitting duck for the sub
all around the room frustration
bobby shakes his head
kenny sinks back in his chair
the president hesitates
put me through to the pierce
admiral anderson nods to a communications officer
the man makes the connection on a switchboard
mcnamara casts an eye to the map
the two red markers labeled gagarin and kimovsk are joined by a third the sub
they are almost touching the blockade line
on the other side the single blue marker for the pierce
the captain enters the bridge takes the phone from the arm of his chair
the president holds the phone agonized
captain can you force that submarine to the surface for inspection without damaging it yourself
i can bring it up mr
but whether its damaged or not is up to the sub
the president lowers the phone looks to bobby and kenny
even if they force it up that sub will be inspected over the crews dead bodies
theyd be executed for allowing it when they got home
all eyes are on the president
his eyes are closed tight face gray hand over his mouth
the time of decision is at hand
he lifts the phone once again
captain force the sub to the surface for inspection
were receiving reports that the ships are stopping
to phone captain belay that order
to mcnamara bob wheres that coming from
just a second mr
will somebody find out whats going on
mccone jumps up leaves the room
the president looks at kenny tense
everyone holds their breath
are they stopping
the hiss of static on the open line fills the room
lookouts peer across the water at the oncoming soviet freighter
of the soviet bridge where their lookouts are staring right back through their binoculars
the hiss of static
mcnamara is grinning wildly at the chaos unfolding in the flag plot below
phones are ringing everywhere
the watch officers hands fly from one notation to the other circling the soviet ships marking them dead in the water
weve got reports coming from all over
the ships are stopping
are turning around
the room explodes victorious
kenny and bobby break into big grins grab each other
kenny pumps the presidents hand
rusk and bundy slap each other on the back
we were eyeball to eyeball and i think the other fellow just blinked
the ruckus goes on for a minute
mccone comes back in
his voice is lost in the celebration
mccone calls out mr
the hubub dies away
sir we have the tally from nsa
we have twenty ships stopping and or turning around
six however appear to be continuing for the line
including the gagarin and kimovsk
the elation goes out of the room
kenny looks at the president
the president picks up the phone again
captain have the ships youre observing changed course
theyve just crossed the quarantine line
bobby grips the edge of the table immediately believing
its an accident
they must not have gotten their orders yet
let em go
weve been monitoring transmissions from both the gagarin and kimovsk
their radios are working fine
one ship an accident maybe
six this is intentional
the president looks to bobby
he has no answer
kennys mind races over the variables and he leans forward intense suddenly understanding in a flash of insight theyre right
this is intentional
he glances around the room
all of excom is looking at him
bobby stares at kenny too shocked to feel betrayed
khruschevs stopped the ships which are carrying contraband and hes letting the ones which arent go through hoping for an incident
i think we should let them go
around the table there are nods
if we do it erodes the credibility of the quarantine
hell just send more through tomorrow
the president looks at kenny
then we deal with it tomorrow
but today hes stopped most of them
hes done something smart here
we gave him an ultimatum and hes agreed to most of it preserving just enough room to save face
we need to do something just as smart now
bobbys nodding following the argument
kenny looks around the room for support
mcnamara pacing on the phone jumps in
president i agree
let them go
four of the six continuing ships are still a day away from the line
theyve stopped all the ones we suspect have weapons aboard
it would look bad shooting up a freighter full of baby food
the president holds kennys gaze then lifts the phone
captain i want you to maintain contact with those ships
do nothing until i order otherwise
is that clear
he hangs up turns to kenny
i hope youre right
kenny bobby and the president make their way across the lawn out of earshot of the building
what happened to speak when spoken to
give it a rest
you were thinking the same thing just didnt have the guts to take the heat
bobby likes getting under kennys skin
bobby aims a punch at his head which kenny knocks away
the president changes gear serious
we can horsetrade with khruschev on ships
but it doesnt get us any closer to removing those missiles
have to hope its a signal that hell back down on the real issue too
were going to have to stop a ship eventually show the quarantines got teeth or well prove mccone right
mcnamaras on his way back here now
we need to pick the right ship
no armed boarding parties either
we need a little more time to figure this one out
then lets move the quarantine line
its a simple suggestion
the president considers him a beat and then mcnamara emerges from the white house heads for them
the three friends assume their more reserved political faces as he comes up
the essex battle group has the gagarin kimovsk and the sub escort under their thumb
weve got a few hours now before we need to worry about any more flashpoints on the line
beat we could use a few more hours
i think we should consider moving the quarantine line back to miles
bobby and the president look at kenny like hes some kind of svengali
kenny just stands there poker faced
kenny and mcnamara enter the white house from the south lawn
they stride down the hall side by side
moving the line
stroke of genius
snappish of course it is
but the president needs to realize were going to have to stop a ship eventually
they turn a corner silence for a beat
the chiefs are looking for a provocation out there
the presidents going to come under enormous pressure
you have to keep em on a short leash bob
mcnamara spares kenny a short nasty look
you must think im blind and stupid
ive already gotten the birds and bees from bobby
the president doesnt have to double barrel me
listen to me goddamn it
were talking about a possible nuclear war
you dropped the ball on bay of pigs you sonofabitch goddamn it i didnt drop you were in the room
it was your purview
it was your job to make sure bissel wasnt fucking us over and you didnt do it
youve got the most important job in the world right now
youre the smartest guy the president has
beat besides me
that gets an amused snort from mcnamara breaking the tension
anybody ever tell you youre an egomaniac and a prick odonnell
kenny stares him in the eye serious hushed
you need to be the best youve ever been
mcnamara enters the elevator
he turns stands there facing kenny for a dramatic beat
then the doors close
walter cronkite on the b w t
screen sits in front of a map showing cuba and the blockade line
well it appears the world has just received a reprieve
defense secretary robert mcnamara has announced that the quarantine zone has been moved from to miles
kenny watching the t
is yelling at the phone
find out how close our exercises are coming to their cruise missiles
im calling you back in five and you will have an answer for me or i will come down there and beat the shit out of you
beat then you can press charges and ill get a presidential pardon
he hangs up hears shouting from the oval office
he goes to the door enters and sees the president leaning over his desk jabbing his finger at general taylor
how the goddamn hell did this happen
im going to have powers head on a platter next to lemays
noticing kenny hey kenny did you hear me give the order to go to defcon
i remember giving the order to go to defcon but i must be suffering from amnesia because ive just been informed our nuclear forces are defcon
kenny realizes hes not joking as he spots bobby sitting on the couch behind taylor pale as a ghost
taylor embattled wants to die but stands there like a man
the nose cone of a titan missile its megaton nuclear warhead wrapped in the steel re entry shell
cold silent fearsome
president the orders were limited to our strategic forces in the continental u
taylor continues on
technically general lemay is correct that sac has the statutory authority the president punches his desk
i have the authority
i am the commander in chief of the united states and i say when we go to war
we are not at war sir not until were at defcon
general the joint chiefs have just signalled our intent to escalate to the soviets
you have signalled an escalation which i had no wish to signal and which i did not approve
but taylor knows this very well
and the way hes suffering its clear hes taking the heat for his underlings
from over on the couch bobby chimes in lemay
the president glances at kenny who stands there speechless
get out of here max
the general leaves
kenny closes the door wanders deeper into the office
he looks from the president to bobby
theres a long long beat of shocked silence
rescind the order
can all the chiefs
put nitze gilpatric and the undersecretaries in charge
we cant do that bobby
hes right we cant rescind defcon
the soviets will think weve gotten sweet on them
and we cant purge the chiefs
our invasion talk will look like a bluff
or even that theres been an attempted coup
bobby is disgusted but knows theyre right
mcnamara wont be able to handle them
its too much for one man
knowing look to kenny with all due respect to our heroic fifth column
the president collapses in his rocking chair
kenny leans over the back of the sofa next to bobby
weve got khruschevs attention with the blockade
if we want a political solution
i think its time to turn up the diplomatic heat
cause if we let this go on too long were going to find ourselves in a war
bobby looks at the president meaningful
the president turns to kenny
ive been considering a variation on one of stevensons ideas
were going to send up a trial balloon through lippman
the jupiter missiles
the west wing looms behind kenny and bundy
kenny poker faced takes a drag on his cigarette
bundy nervously flicks his looks away from kenny a beat
what did you think of lippmans column this morning
i think its a bad idea
bundy turns back to him
look everyone is furious about it
we trade away our missiles in turkey and were fucked politically
kenny grinds his jaw but doesnt say anything
bundy steps up to him confiding
you gotta stop em
we know its jack and bobbys idea they leaked it to lippman
the military guys are going ape and theyre not alone
then they should speak up
christ ken you know its not that easy
yes it is
no it isnt
they dont trust the people that feel this way
but these people are right
and the kennedys are wrong
beat we need you to tell em kenny
theyll listen to you
kenny prickles intense but bundy presses on too wrapped up in his own thinking to notice
jack and bobby are good men
but it takes a certain character moral toughness to stand up to you listen to me
nobody nobody talks about my friends that way
youre fucking here right now because of the kennedys
they may be wrong
they make mistakes
but theyre not weak
the weak ones are these people who cant speak their own minds
you know i dont mean theyre weak
kenny gets in his face intimidating
no they just lack moral toughness
and you think ill play your judas
you wasps and blue bloods never understood us thinking we want into your club
well we got our own club now
beat and you guys dont realize fighting with each other is our way
nobody plays us off each other
and nobody ever gets between us
kenny throws himself on a chair in the bedrooms sitting area newspaper in hand
the president buttoning his shirt in a full length mirror sees him
theres a tv on
the president selects a tie from a nearby rack eyes the paper
oh just a bunch of crap about withdrawing our jupiter missiles in turkey if the sovietsll do the same in cuba
the presidents eyes flick over to him in the mirror
i dont want to listen to this again
if we made a trade wed be giving in to extortion and nato would never trust us again
well get clobbered in world opinion
its a goddman trial balloon
trial is the operative word here
then somebodyd better deny it publicly
the president turns around heads over to the t
kenny folds his arms disgusted
jesus christ odonnell youre the one saying we need to move forward on a political solution
yeah a good political solution
live coverage of the united nations security council meetings
holding forth in russian is valerian zorin s tough likeable the soviet ambassador to the u
and chairman of the security council
a translator relays the meaning
we call on the world to condemn the piratical actions of america
the presidents jaw tightens
he turns to kenny
you want to turn up the heat
you call adlai
tell him to stick it to zorin
kenny phone to his ear suffers as bobby harangues him
adlais too weak
we have to convince jack to pull him get mccloy in there
you cant take him out this late in the game
zorin will eat him alive
then talk to your brother goddamn it
the two of you dont need any advice to get into trouble
whats gotten into you
kenny throws the lippman article at him
oh still sore about this
something your father wouldve come up with
that paralyzes bobby
kenny stares at him
he means it but regrets it too
my father im just trying to make a point
this idea is that fucking bad
but bobby gets it
kenny shifts gears lets it go
adlai can handle zorin
he knows the inning and the score
because nobody thinks hes up to this
suite is in frantic preparation staffers coming and going
stevenson takes his phone from a secretary
kenny turns to gaze at his little t
in the credenza u
coverage continuing as if he could see adlai there
adlai its kenny
howre you doing
adlai is packing up his briefcase
what do you need
kenny rises from his chair paces toward the t
the president told me to pass the word to you stick it to them
adlai looks around to his own t
showing the session going on downstairs
zorin on camera dominates the council alternately bold aggressive and then reasonable
even in russian with the lagging translation hes formidable
kenny is watching exactly the same performance
zorin is masterful
kenny knows it
and when he talks to adlai its with the fatalism of a coach knowing hes putting his third string quarterback in against the all pro linebacker
the world has to know were right
if were going to have a chance at a political solution we need international pressure
you got to be tough adlai
you need to find it old friend
adlai watches his staffers leave his inner office
he hears kenny and everything kenny is saying
i hear you
im glad its you calling
i thought it would be bobby
if theyre still sticking to their stonewall strategy ill get em
beat thanks ken
adlai lowers the phone to its cradle
an anxious staffer sticks his head in the door a concerned questioning look on his face
adlai adjusts his tie
his hand is shaking
he notices it and manages a brave smile
im an old political cat jimmy
beat but ive got one life left
adlai briefcase in hand marches down the hall at the hand of his team staffers and photo interpreters with large leather portfolio bags
the big double doors to the council chamber loom and he gestures to the photo interpreters
and then a doorman throws open the door for him
he is instantly dwarfed by the enormous room
cameras the imposing circular arrangement of delegation tables
and the entire world is watching
then as the first security council members begin to notice him he heads for the vacant seats for the american delegation
the romanian delegate saws the air
through translator we call upon the world to condemn this purely american provocation
but as the romanian wheezes on all eyes are on adlai
adlai takes his seat his staffers behind him
they pass him up papers and he spreads them before him taking no notice that the entire room is staring at him
adlai finally glances up
across the circle sits zorin in the flesh at the head of his own tough looking delegation
he acknowledges adlai with a superior smile
we the people of romania stand in solidarity with the people of cuba and their revolution in the face of this american threat to world peace
thank you mr
the romanian delegate leans back from his microphone
zorin leans forward begins in russian and the translators voice catches up with him
his tone body language composure are all that of complete confidence
through translator we are glad you could join us mr
adlai nods returns to his notes as zorin continues
for the last couple of hours i have heard nothing but questions from the world here
the united states has led us to the brink of calamity
the peoples of the world want to know why
we are told again and again of this so called incontrovertible evidence of offensive weapons in cuba
yet we are not allowed to see this evidence
are your spy planes so secret you cannot share this evidence with us
the audience laughs
zorin basks in it
and then grows stern
or perhaps there is no such evidence
perhaps the united states is mistaken
excom watches the coverage on the situation rooms t
the president and bobby sit side by side kenny just behind them
bobby checks his watch looks at the president
i make the call and adlai is out
mccloy goes in
bobby looks back at kenny
lets hope it doesnt come to that
zorin stares at adlai
adlai studiously ignores him works on his own papers
the united states has no facts in hand
falsity is what america has in its hands false evidence
zorin leans back in his chair
adlai finally looks up
he meets zorins icy bravura
he notes the cameras around the room
this is the grandest stage of all
the chair recognizes the representative from the united states
and in that moment adlai becomes the spokesman for america
well let me say something to you mr
ambassador we do have the evidence
we have it and it is clear and incontrovertible
adlais tone is definitive
a tremor of interest passes through the various delegations
and let me say something else
those weapons must be taken out of cuba
you the soviet union have created this new danger not the united states
excom is transfixed by the continuing debate
come on adlai
they all crowd the t
as if it were a title fight
except for bobby
kenny glances over at him
he has the phone pinned between his ear and shoulder
kenny looks back to the adlai fixes zorin in his seat his voice rising
zorin i remind you that the other day you did not deny the existence of these weapons
but today again if i heard you correctly you now say they do not exist
zorin headphones on listens to his own translation but doesnt respond acts bored
it gets adlais goat and he begins to lose his cool
a rumble from the u
the camera finds adlais hand shaking gripping his pen
excom is worried
come on adlai dont let him off
get ready to send your staffer in
hes going to be coming out
but adlais tremors are not tremors of fear
they are tremors of anger
his voice goes hard and cold
all right sir
let me ask you one simple question
do you ambassador zorin deny that the u
has placed and is placing medium and intermediate range missiles and sites in cuba
yes or no dont wait for the translation yes or no
the diplomatic world gasps as adlai drops all pretense of civility all statesman like grace
excoms excitement mounts
in the chorus urging adlai on we find kenny edge toward the screen
zorin shoots adlai a testy look
i am not in an american courtroom sir and therefore i do not wish to answer a question that is put to me in the fashion in which a prosecutor
in due course sir you will have your answer
theres laughter at zorins refusal to be bullied but its nervous laughter not the polite stuff of diplomatic tete a tete
the rumble in the room grows louder
you are in the courtroom of world opinion right now and you can answer yes or no
you have denied they exist and i want to know if i have understood you correctly
fists in the air
bobby lets the phone dangle a beat covers it
and then he lifts it again
john ill get back to you
he lowers the phone to the receiver
kenny shoots him a triumphant smile
the president looks at kenny shakes his head a big smile on his face
adlai presses on
and im prepared to present the evidence in this room proving that the soviet union has lied to the world
and zorin cracks
he looks uneasily to his delegation
they bend forward to consult
adlai sits back in his chair draping his arms over its wings with the confidence of someone who knows hes kicked ass
adlai looks around the room while hes waiting for his answer managing not to smile
the diplomatic world is scandalized
at last zorin regroups lifts his head from his huddle
if you do not choose to continue your statement the chair recognizes the representative from chile
the chilean delegate stands
i yield my time and the floor to the representative to the united states
the room explodes in laughter
not just nervous any more not just polite
theyre laughing at zorins parliamentary ploy blowing up in his face
zorins smile is gone his smooth facade destroyed
and he looks like the biggest fool in the world
adlai stares at the beet faced man with disdain
at last adlai stands gestures to the door to the hall behind him
the photo interpreters come racing in with their briefing boards
well then ladies and gentlemen since it appears we might be here for a while shall we have a look at what the soviets are doing in cuba
the delegates rumble in interest rise from their seats to approach adlai
phones ring at several of the chairs at the conference table
the president and kenny meet as bundy picks up a phone in the b
didnt know adlai had it in him
too bad he didnt have this stuff in
zorin must not have gotten instructions
somebody in their foreign ministrys blown it big time
bundy steps forward holding the phone
kenny and the president turn to see what they already have heard in those two words concern
the room falls quiet
phone in hand mcnamara paces at his post over the flag plot
the ship is called groznyy
the soviet tanker groznyy breasts the heavy seas
armed crewmen race along the deck to makeshift sandbagged emplacements in the bow
we lost track of it yesterday at nightfall
we thought we gave it plenty of room when we moved the quarantine line back
we just reacquired it
the camera pans to the left revealing a u
destroyer racing up alongside a few hundred yards away pounding up and over the swells punching up a huge fan of spray from its bow
it crossed the line hours ago
admiral anderson on the phone on the level below is tense
hail them again
keep us posted bob
mcnamara leans against the wall closes his eyes in exhaustion and stress
and when he opens the we pan around a g d like view of the flag plot covered with hundreds of mcnamara stares out at the bewildering tangle of symbols
living men behind each one
each tangle of red and blue symbols a powderkeg
a g dlike view indeed
and it is far more than any one mere man could keep control of
and he begins to realize it
were kidding ourselves
and not only that in his bleary sleep deprived fog he begins to understand something happening down there
the camera moves over the enormous map over the scrolling cryptic numerology
the buzz of radio communications bleeds in from the background
the overhead platform swivels on its motor like the vast arm of some fate writing god as the watch officer on it updates the movements of the ships
mcnamara stares at the verge of grasping something
through the door crack of genius he has the glimpse of some grander thing some grander design
load your guns
that starts mcnamara from his fatigued reverie
he goes to the railing looks down on anderson
what was that admiral
anderson turns gazes up from his tier below distracted
weve been hailing the groznyy for the last hour mr
the groznyy refuses to stop
what are you doing
carrying out our mission mr
if you dont mind were very busy right now
we need to be able to do our jobs
admiral i asked you a question
anderson holds the phone aside turns around again looks up at him impatient
his answer is hard cold dangerous
were going to follow the rules of engagement
the rules of engagement which the president has approved and signed in his order of october rd
anderson listens again to the phone
yes captain you may proceed
clear your guns
what the destroyers forward inch twin guns swivel train on the groznyy
they open fire with an ear splitting bambam ripping the air in front of the muzzles the groznyy so close a miss isnt possible
mcnamara shouts at anderson dropping down the steps to andersons level
watch officers scramble to comply chaos and shouting in the war room as a chorus if cease fire cease fire cease fire goes up
mcnamara turns on anderson is in his face
jesus christ god help us
anderson smashes the phone down wheels on mcnamara furious
the destroyers guns hammer away at the groznyy at point blank range
but the groznyy is unharmed
suddenly in the air above it appear brilliant flares
they light up the ship brighter than the sun
the destroyer isnt firing deadly rounds
its firing harmless starshells
anderson gets in mcnamaras face
that ship was firing starshells
everyones eyes are on the two men
only the chatter of teletype breaks the paralyzing silence
mcnamara blinks looks down at the plot on the floor
andersons voice drops to a deadly sotto
goddammitt ive got a job to do
youve been camped out up there since monday night
youre exhausted and youre making mistakes
interfere with me you will get some of killed
i will not allow that
mcnamara looks away at the faces of the men in the room
get out of our way mr
the navy has been running blockades since the days of john paul jones
mcnamara turns back
and all trepidation embarrassment hesitation are gone
he coldly appraises anderson
i believe the president made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission
with all due respect mr
secretary we were not firing on the ship
firing on a ship means attacking the ship
we were not attacking the ship
we were firing over it
this was not the presidents intention when he gave that order
what if the soviets dont see the distention
what if they make the same mistake i just did
beat there will be no firing anything near any soviet ships without my express permission is that understood admiral
and i will only issue such instructions when ordered to by the president
beat john paul jones
you dont understand a thing do you admiral
he passes his hand over the enormous plot below
this isnt a blockade
mcnamara trembling with anger awe whirls to anderson
and his burgeoning insight is born clear hard and cold
this all this is language a new vocabulary the likes of which the world has never seen
this is president kennedy communicating with secretary khruschev
mcnamara jabs his finger out at the plot and the camera races down tracking over it across the vast ebb and flow of information the delicate ballet of symbols and
numerology this language of steel and human life
on kennys t
walter cronkite reads the news to footage of a boarding party going up a ladder to the freighter marcula
at this morning the u
joseph kennedy stopped and boarded the soviet charter vessel marcula
the boarding party wears dress whites and is unarmed
after a hour inspection the kennedy signaled no contraband found
cleared to continue
pentagon spokesmen expect the next encounter
kenny who turns from the t
as the door to his office opens
rusk walks in
kenny we need to see the president
kenny reacts to rusks enigmatic expression
and out from behind rusk steps john scali the abc news correspondent
off their reactions the camera finds an under strength ad hoc excom kenny bobby taylor bundy sorensen mccone ball and the president
guarded hope all around
the short balding pugnacious scali looks discomfited
i have lunch with him maybe once a month
way he talks he acts like he knows khruschev personally but hes never elaborated
ive used him as a source in a couple of stories
kenny paces behind the gathered men around the presidents desk listening mind going a million miles an hour
the fbi has identified this alexander fomin as the soviet resident the kgb equivalent of one of our station chiefs
hes their highest ranking spy in this country
and he knows johns a friend of mine
all the trademarks of a back channel overture
kenny eyes bundy makes him uncomfortable
the president sizes scali up
so theyll remove the missiles and well pledge not to invade cuba destabilize castro or assist anyone who plans in doing so
nobody dares speak
its as if the possibility of a settlement will vanish into thin air if anyone moves
this may be our first real message from khruschev
the alternative mr
president is that this could be a trap
dangle a settlement tie us down in negotiations we come up short
why else would they approach us in this way
the soviets have done nothing but lie to us
this could be more of the same
that may be why khruschevs introducing this guy
weve been burned by his usual players in the formal channels so he brings in an honest broker
that may be what they want us to think
the truth is mr
president we dont even really know whom fomin speaks for
it could be khruschev
it could be some faction in the politburo or the kgb itself
we just dont know
by the way scali your activities now fall under the secrecy codicils of the national security act
sorry no pulitzer
the gathered men chuckle only scali a bit dour but being a good sport about it
scali checks his watch
president we dont have much time
im supposed to meet with him again in three and a half hours
well it seems the question of the day is is the offer legitimate
he moves away from his desk
the men watch him
if it is
if it is then we cant afford to ignore it
beat to scali john well have instructions for you in a couple of hours
rusk escorts him out
they wait until the door closes
taylor looks over at mccone who nods
president im afraid we have some bad news
were getting gmaic estimates from our latest low level overflights
it appears the missiles are two to three days away from operational status
so we dont have much time to play out back channel communiques
kenny gives bobby a hard look
the president appears unfazed
the quarantine sir is not producing results
the chiefs feel its time you take another look at our options
the president considers taylor then looks over to kenny
kenny get over to your old stomping grounds
go through everything the fbi has on fomin
i need your best call is this guy legit and is he speaking for khruschev
and i need you to tell me by the time i call you because right after i call you im calling scali with his instructions
a stack of files slams down beside kenny on a large paper covered conference table
walter sheridan kennys investigator buddy wears a visitors pass just like kenny
kenny and walter rifle through the folders super fast super proficient
a half dozen fbi agents work around the table
so what weve got is this guy alexander feklisov aka alexander fomin declared consul to the soviet embassy but in reality the kgb papa spy
an illustrious tour of duty during the great patriotic war gets him on the party fast track various tours of duty in kgb american postings
hes an expert on us and
thats all weve got on papa spy
whos he talking for
is it khruschev or is this more bullshit
kenny stands runs his hands through his hair aggravated
how do you become the kgb top spy in the united states
gotta know someone
kenny whirls on sheridan
a frozen beat
politics is politics
whirling on agents khruschev is the moscow party boss under stalin
give me their career chronologies
walter pushes a typed dateline of khruschevs major career moves and one of the agents hands kenny a list of fomins postings
he lays them side by side
and for every step of khruschevs theres a step for fomin
not only that but the dates are identical or nearly so
every time khruschev moves up fomin does within a year
tracing up the list khruschev was the administrator in charge of preparing moscows defenses during the war
was here in the u
kennys face falls
but a young fbi agent cuts in
not at first
the young fbi agent proffers him a file
kenny snatches it
he was an engineer stationed outside moscow in
specialized in tank traps
kenny looks up at walter
walter nods sagely lights a pipe
they know each other
theyre war buddies
but real life usually is
a phone on the table shrills shattering the silent triumph
ive got to move
what do you have kenny
they know each other
khruschev and feklisov aka fomin were war buddies
dont take it to court but weve got good circumstantial evidence
off walters nod walter agrees
my guts telling me khruschevs turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message
a few lonely business travelers hang out in the dim coffee shop
faint music plays
scali and alexander fomin sit with steaming cups of coffee
scali nervous unfolds a note
fomin an expressionless gray spectre of a man eyes him
he is in his boredom a spys spy
i am instructed to tell you that the american government would respond favorably to an offer along the lines you have discussed
if this solution were raised at the u
by ambassador zorin he would find a favorable reply from ambassador stevenson
so i understand you correctly
if the missiles in cuba were dismantled returned to the soviet union and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them the united states would be prepared to guarantee that
it would never invade cuba
that is correct
this is from the highest authority
from the highest authority
there are two conditions
must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles
and of course the u
must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the american southeast
he has no instructions on this count
and the second condition
time is of the essence
scali takes a sip of coffee
fomin stares at him intense
how much time
in hours there can be no deals
scali finishes debriefing the president bobby kenny mccone taylor and bundy
he left right away
got the feeling he meant business
kenny and bobby share a hopeful glance
rusk enters from kennys office
and hes unable to contain his excitement
president were receiving a letter from khruschev over at state
from a cluster of folding metal chairs kenny bobby rusk and sorensen watch a teletype hammer out the message as it comes off the wire
its painfully slow like watching a bad typist type a manuscript
ten pages of this is an eternity
to top it off its in russian
a translator reads it off word by word to a transcriber
kenny slams a page of khruschevs letter on the table
he jabs his finger at it
excom listens intent
its ten pages of sentimental fluff but hes saying right here
hell remove the missiles in return for a no invasion pledge
it looks like fomins overture was genuine
the president turns to mccone
our early analysis says this was probably written by khruschev himself
its a first draft and shows no signs of being polished by the foreign ministry
in fact it probably hasnt been approved by the politburo
they wouldnt have let the emotionalism go by
the analysts say it was written by someone under considerable stress
glad to hear were not alone
the president eyes the excom members one by one an incipient smile on his face
well gentlemen i wasnt planning on invading cuba anyway
i think we can live with the terms of this deal
there are mostly nods of assent big smiles around the table
except from mccone and taylor
the president takes his copy of the letter flips through it
he shakes his head almost unable to believe that khruschev has given in
a long beat
ted i want you to draft our acceptance
a long black car stops at the end of kennys driveway
the door opens and kenny steps out
he says an inaudible goodnight to the driver and the car pulls off
he turns facing the white two story house with the neat front yard the lights out
and he smiles
home at last
a screen door squeaks open
kenny steps out into the darkness of the back yard
and there in her robe sitting startled on a lawn chair lit only by the dim glow of the kitchen window is helen
kenny stands there tired his coat slung over his shoulder
helen rises her own care worn face turned to his
for a silent moment they gaze at each other searching in the lines of each others face for the changes of a long separation
they see them
but theyve been married a long time and the awkwardness passes
you look old
kenny drops his coat on a table as helen comes up and folds herself into his arms
this jobs going to kill you
if i dont first
they kiss comfortable
but not too long and he lets her go
she looks at him again sees hes suppressing a smile
if youre home it means either jack and bobby have finally figured out what a con man you are and fired you or we got a back channel communication from
khruschev this evening feeling us out about a deal
he confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter to the president
i think weve won
a thing like this
who could even think of winning
kenny in his overcoat steps aside as a pair of duty officers race past him almost bowling him over
he slows as he nears the doors to his office and the oval office discovering total chaos
excom guys assistants dart to and from the offices and halls
on all their faces grim expressions
kenny stands there a beat in confusion
and then bobby swings out of kennys office
theres a desperate edge to bobbys voice
whereve you been
weve been trying to find you all morning
helen and i went out for breakfast
excoms not supposed to convene til eight
we just got a second letter from khruschev
the deals off
kenny and bobby walk fast for the cabinet room kenny still in his coat
were getting everyone together as fast as we can
what does the letter say
they want us to take our missiles out of turkey along with the no invasion pledge
it looks like fomin was a ploy after all and they were just stalling for time
kenny is stunned
it gets worse
kenny gives bobby a sharp look as they enter the president in shirtsleeves no tie glances up at kenny as he and bobby enter
kenny can only bear his look for a second he blew the call on fomin
but the president is clearly relieved to see him gives him a faint smile
half of excom including mcnamara mccone rusk and taylor barely notice them as theyre already there arguing
kenny sits down hurriedly shucks off his coat as he joins the conversation in mid stream
my specialists are in agreement this mornings letter is not khruschev
last nights letter was
beat the evidence supports only one conclusion there has been a coup and khruschev was replaced overnight
bobby gives him a look told you things got worse
it doesnt necessarily mean theres been a coup
khruschevs name is signed to the letter
aw come on dean
but at the very least
it does suggest hes been co opted by hard line elements
which at the end of the day is the same thing as a coup
a puppet khruschev and a hard line soviet government pulling the strings
and the missiles are almost operational
they all look to the president
imminent victory has turned to ashes
the president studies his own folded hands
ball and thompson enter take seats
one by one throughout the scene other excom members join the group
you know the problem we have is that this is latest offer of theirs will seem reasonable to everyone
we remove our missiles they remove theirs
our jupiters were scheduled for removal anyway
theyre obsolete after all
kenny shakes his head in mute anger
mcnamara and rusk seem to sense the presidents feelings too
president agreeing to such a trade would be tantamount to paying ransom
theyll put a gun to our head again and expect us to pay again
kenny looks the president in the eye
we cant sell out one of our friends for our own safety
nato wouldnt trust us anymore and theyd be right not to
the president sighs in the face of the stern advice
he nods expecting as much
bobby still cant look at anyone
so which one of you geniuses can tell me how to explain ourselves to the world
how do we work with them if theres been a hard line coup
president there is another possibility we havent considered
this may not be a coup at all
everyone of kennys instincts jumps
his head snaps up to listen to taylor
its possible that the back channel overture last nights letter and this letter today along with everything the soviets have said all along is nothing more than a lie disinformation
designed to keep us from taking action
kenny hears the fatalism in mcnamaras voice
a long beat
everyone stares at mcnamara
i hate to say it but if i had to bet id bet max is right
what if they have no intention of honoring this deal either
then tomorrow they add another condition
meanwhile the quarantine isnt working and theyre continuing to work on the missile sites
beat i think we have to consider issuing warning orders for our forces
they were so close last night
and suddenly lundahl and lemay enter the room with the days briefing boards
lundahl stands there at the end of the table gray
he almost cant say it cant look the president in the face
this mornings photography is in
it appears the soviets have commenced a crash program to ready the missiles
the missiles site is now more than just dirt and clearing equipment
its an armed camp with missiles fuel trailers erectors spaced every few hundred yards
missile technicians service the towering ss s
the first missiles became operational last night
with a barrage of shouted orders in russian and a whine of the erectors engines the missile begins to rise
we expect theyll all be operational in hours monday morning
it stops vertical
the news hits the room like a thunderbolt
kenny looks to bobby and the president
the blood is gone from their faces
then were out of time
we have to go in
that may not be as easy as we thought either
weve gotten confirmation that the soviets have also deployed battlefield nuclear weapons to cuba
a pall falls over the room as lemay explains
frogs we call em
short range tactical nukes
its possible theyve delegated release authority to their local commanders for use against our invasion troops
itd be standard doctrine
beat our capability to get all the missiles has eroded during our delay with the quarantine
the good news is that for the moment we know where the frogs are and we can target them too
but the longer we wait the hard its going to get
they all look to the president
kenny stares in a private hell blacker and more complete than anyone should ever know
in that shocked silence each man grapples with failure
the best and the brightest could not prevent what must come next
then we have no choice
to taylor general issue the warning orders to our forces
they will be prepared to execute the air strikes monday morning and the follow on invasion according to the schedule thereafter
ill need the official release orders on my desk sunday night
we need to step up the overflights finalize our pilots target folders in order to be able to carry out the strikes
the president gives kenny a meaningful look
kenny rises gives the president an almost imperceptible nod as he prepares to leave in taylors wake
gentlemen if anybodys got any great ideas nows the time
major rudolph anderson wearing the bulky high altitude pressure suit of a u pilot takes the phone from one of the air force ncos who are helping him suit up
this is major anderson
kenny at the other end of the line stares out the window at the fall day
it seems so mild so unlike war
and it takes him a beat before he realizes andersons on the line
major my name is kenneth odonnell
special assistant to the president
kenny takes a breath ready to start the shuck and jive
but for some reason doesnt
major a few days ago the president ordered me to help him keep control of whats going on out there
ive been browbeating pilots navy guys left and right to make sure you dont get us here in washington into trouble
but you know what
were pretty damn good at getting ourselves into trouble
so instead of riding your ass im just going to tell you whats going on and let you figure out how best to help us out up here
now mostly suited up major anderson takes the phone out of the ncos hand
he nods serious
go ahead sir
last night we looked like we were going to cut a deal to get us all out of this mess
today the soviets are reneging
were going to try to salvage the situation but a lot of things are going wrong today
its making everyone nervous and it will be very hard to avoid going to war
dont get shot down major
beyond that whatever else you can do to help us id really appreciate it
major anderson waves his ncos away
they leave the room
the major sits on a bench in front of his locker thinks
when youre up there at feet theres a million things that can go wrong
is your oxygen mix right
will your cameras freeze up
are you leaving contrail
beat those million things are beyond your control mostly
but you know when you realize that theres a kind of peace
you dont need to be in control
you never were in control in the first place
if youre a good man and your ground crew are good men its all you can ask for
and with the grace of g d itll get you through
the young major smiles to himself to the phone
you sound like a good man
youll be all right mr
we believe in you guys down here
beat thanks for the call
kenny nods to himself deeply touched by the mans faith
thank you major
with a click the line goes dead and anderson walks the phone over to the receiver on the wall
a cart speeds down the tarmac an nco behind the wheel
beside him sits major anderson his helmet on visor up
he adjusts the mix on the oxygen bottle hes carrying at his feet breathing in preparation for the high altitude flight
up ahead among a host of service vehicles sits the u
anderson switches over to the u s oxygen supply as his ncos belt him in
they slap him on the helmet for good luck and lower the canopy as he brings his engines up to power
this is flight g requesting permission for take off
g youve got runway one you are cleared to proceed to angels
and he throws the throttle forward the twilight in between world of the stratosphere
far below clouds shining blue day
above stars and the indigo depths of space
we hang in utter silence
a silver glint appears in the center of the horizon
it grows larger
then larger still
it is the u
we barely have time to register the rising hiss of its engines when it fills the screen and booms past leaving us standing still
the camera pans to follow it but its already dwindled to a speck and we feel how fast miles an hour really is
andersons gloved hand reaches for the camera heater switches
the belly door whines open like a silver eyelid exposing the cameras lense
anderson double checks his position switches to the autopilot for the stability only the machine can provide then hits the camera activate button on his joystick
the camera begins its photography
anderson watches the number on the film remaining counter spool down
he stares out the window
the towering clouds below rise up magnificent glorious
a glimpse of heaven
rapt anderson stares
and then suddenly a blaring alarm goes off in the cockpit
it shocks anderson around to the controls
its his missile warning light
anderson hands flash out to the joystick turning off the cameras disabling autopilot
he banks the u hard
as the u turns far far below emerging from the clouds barely visible rises a contrail
it arcs lazily toward us
a beat and then another contrail
the anti aircraft missiles creating them are too small to be seen with the naked eye
the cockpit is a cacophony of alarms and lights the horizon outside tilted
andersons breath comes fast rasping as he does his strains going into the high g turn
he looks out the cockpit window finds the first sa missile in pursuit only several thousand feet below him now
waits still in the turn
the black head of the missile now visible
he puts the plane over rolling out into an opposite bank
the spy planes long flimsy wings werent made for dogfighting
they bend terribly in the rollout
and then the first missile streaks past tries to correct its miss but cant and vanishes into the distance at a degree angle
andersons breath comes faster and faster as the second missile rises up now visible
he puts the throttle as far as it goes trying to outrun death
every second is a tenth of a mile and every mile shortens the missiles life span
the rising missile drafts aft closing on the u from behind
the second missiles contrail rises up behind the plane levels off and closes on it at a tremendous rate
the third missile rises up in the far distance behind the second
the second missile races up on the u closer right behind it cant miss
then at a hundred yards the contrail suddenly peters out and the missile out of fuel drops away
but the third missile closes
anderson glances out the window sees the spent missiles fall away and spots the third missile still seeking him aft
hand pinning the throttle forward he prays under his breath
the third sa rides its billowing column of exhaust straight for the tail of the u
this one is not out of fuel
major anderson opens his eyes
he stares out the window at the glorious wonder of cloud and sea and earth below
and the missile looms
we have time to realize its almost as big as the plane itself before it shears right into the u s tail and explodes in a blinding flash
kenny jogging down the hall hears form an open door
kenny goes over to the threshold
inside the office bundy stands up from behind his desk grave
and kenny knows
all of excom is there except for bundy
kenny sits behind the president deeply distraught over major anderson
does this attack on our plane represent a definitive intentional escalation on the part of the soviets
the soviets are in control of the sams
its hard to believe with their centralized command structure that it could be an accidental launch
president taken with the events of the past few hours i believe this confirms our worst fears
were now dealing with a hard line soviet government perhaps with khruschev as a puppet head perhaps not
in the silence kenny reads the faces around the room
theyre convinced by mccones pronouncement
it could be a mistake
mccone gives him a get serious look
but kenny presses on
we need to be positive before we react
bundy enters the room
everyone looks up
he stands there in the doorway his face tight
kenny sags in his chair
bundy of course has more bad news and they all know it
a hopeless beat
the president just stares at bundy unable to ask
bundy nods affirming what everyone is thinking
a u on a routine air sampling mission over siberia got lost and penetrated soviet airspace
the soviets scrambled migs in pursuit thinking it was a bomber
it got out okay
somebody forgot to cancel the mission
theres always some sonofabitch who doesnt get the word
all we need is the soviets thinking were bombing them
facetious anybody else
the humor falls on a cold audience
president our pilots are in danger
we must order punitive airstrikes against the sam site that shot down major anderson per our rules of engagement
and finally the moment kenny has dreaded all this time has come to pass
he looks at bobby then at the president
the president stares at the cup of coffee in his hands as if trying to read the fates design in it
a long beat and everyone holds their breath
i want confirmation there wasnt some sort of accident first
lemay clears his throat
everyone looks at him expecting him to scream or jump up and down
i think thats a good idea mr
itll be safer for my boys to get those sams on monday when we get the rest of the bastards
i can wait a day and a half
very well then
but he says it without any belief in the words realizing theyre being tied fast to the train tracks of war
alone in his office shattered kenny stares out the window viewing the distant ellipse through a gap in the trees
kids are out there playing football
he glances at his watch and grabs his jacket
kenny puts on his jacket as he goes down the steps into the bright autumn day walking away from the white house
it drops behind him his step is faster more urgent
kenny walks down the sidewalk drawn toward the ellipse
the sixth grade football players sweep forward with a running play
kenny scans them searching his breath coming hard
he reaches the edge of the open field
and then he spots the name on the jersey odonnell
the players relinquish the ball and the offense comes off the field
kevin sees his dad
kenny manages a smile as kevin trots over
kevin pulls his helmet off
they stand there a long beat kenny desperate to take him up abandon his post
but he doesnt
but kevin sees the turmoil in his fathers face
is everything going to be okay dad
kennys forced smile is answer enough
everythings gonna be fine
but kevin knows
together they know
the end of the world is at hand
i guess you wont be coming home tonight
suddenly a car honks
kenny turns around
bobby is leaning out the rear passenger window of his limo
and he sees what kenny is doing
he doesnt want to cut in but has to
we need to talk
kenny looks back at his son
get back out there kid
remember to hit em hard
what about you
where are you going
back to work
kevin puts his helmet back on his head
kenny watches as kevin jogs off to rejoin his team
kenny turns his back on his son and strides for bobbys limo dying inside
kenny and bobby stand by their car off to one side of the restaurants parking lot
bobbys secret service agents maintain a discreet distance
if were going to make a deal were going to have to do it fast
this is only getting out of control
the only reason were not at war this very minute is hes been able to stretch bend and break his own rules
he wont be able to keep it up forever
bobby jams the last bit of sandwich in his mouth
kenny looks him in the eye
and jack wants to trade the missiles in turkey
the jupiters are obsolete
they were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway jesus mary and joseph
i told you how stupid it was to float the lippman article
but you wouldnt listen to me
what if there hasnt been a coup at all
what if its you two who invited that second letter by raising the possibility of a trade
bobby is speechless with rage
and if the two of you are thinking this trade is your ace in the hole youre so wrong
its a deuce
bobbys beyond furious
they catch their rising voices
and its not just me who thinks that
everyone on this so called excom is telling you exactly the same thing make the trade and theyre going to force us into trade after trade until finally they demand
something we wont trade like berlin and we do end up in a war
beat not to mention that long before that happens this government will be politically dead
bobby simmers for a long beat thinking
and boy does this guy hate admitting hes wrong
all right so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look
so now what
so now youve got to talk him out of it
and then weve got to figure out an acceptable political solution
and if there has been a coup and there is no acceptable political solution
kenny stares off at the city agonized
kenny enters from his office finding bobby rusk and sorensen talking with the president
the president gives him a brief meaningful look
whatever response we send it will take several hours for the wire to be received by our embassy and delivered to the kremlin
so were looking at early tomorrow morning at the earliest before khruschev could respond
as rusk talks kenny passes close by bobby
bobby whispers he gets it but hes pissed
thats all well and good but what do we say to em
it depends on if we really believe theres been a coup
that strikes a cord with kenny
if there has been a coup and theres a hard line government in power now then it doesnt matter what we say
the end of the day well either agree to their terms theyll agree to ours or well go to war
but what if there hasnt been a coup
what if what is happening is a series of accidents
the second letter is an accident
the letter is an intentional but its having an effect far greater than its authors intended
beat what if our jupiter missiles are just a last minute haggle to salvage something
maybe a bone khruschev is throwing to the hard line not really caring if we reject it or not
beat and then these accidents have happened
making the second letter and the overall picture look worse than it really is
the guns of august
beat if theyre sane and human like we are then maybe we just refuse and theyll let it slide like weve been letting things slide
so we reject the second letter
and kenny looks at bobby
the world stops
we dont reject it
it hits bobby like a lightning bolt
we accept the first letter and pretend the second doesnt exist
the president rusk and sorensen stare at him mute
hold on the exact same mute reaction from the entire assembled excom
finally mccone breaks the spell
it wont work bobby kenny and sorensen start to object but mccone raises his voice over theirs
because its wishful thinking
its the same wishful thinking that blinded us all these months while the soviets were sneaking those missiles in under our noses
mcnamara shakes his head intrigued but skeptical
ignore the second letter agree to the conditions of the first
theres no reason to believe the soviets will let it go
max is right
why will they accept it
it can work
if if they believe well hit them
kenny bobby and sorensen look at mcnamara grateful
weve only got time for one more round of diplomacy
the first airstrikes start in less than hours
but we have to make them agree to it
so how do we do that
the president leans forward
sensing hes about to speak all eyes turn to him
we give them something
we tell them well remove the missiles from turkey say six months from now so that there appears to be no linkage
we also tell them if they go public about it we deny it and the deal is off
and we do it under the table so we can disavow any knowledge of it
the pressll be all over it
six months from now im not going to care
well deal with it
at least it will expose whether khruschev has been overthrown
well know what were dealing with
and if this is a move to appease the hard line then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house
most excom is nodding agreeing
mccone shakes his head in disgust
taylor sits in silence
whoever carries the message has to hit the nail on the head
come across as too soft theyll push us
too hard theyll be cornered and even more dangerous
they could pre empt
its a terrible responsibility to bear
the room is silent
at last bobby looks up from his folded hands to his brother
the president stares back
there is nobody else who can do this
you know dobrynin best
bobby nods taking up the gauntlet
ted you get working on the draft
sorensen and bobby rise as one head for the doors
and make sure he knows we have to have an answer tomorrow
beat final because on monday we begin military action against cuba
bobby and kenny exchange a look
a long shot bobby emerges from the west wing in his overcoat briefcase in hand
he pauses tiny alone
the west wing and all its imposing spotlit power behind him reduced to this insignificant man on his eleventh hour mission
and then out of the shadows in the f
steps kenny in his own coat his breath frosting in the late night air
bobby sees him and knows he is not so alone anymore
they meet in front of the limo
bobby stops shuffles his things awkward
what do you want
a good bye kiss
kenny opens the drivers side door
the secret service limo driver peers out
listen ill take care of him
go ahead in grab some coffee
well be back pretty quick
kennys nod and look theres no arguing
the limo driver hops out and kenny gets in
bobby stands there outside for a beat
he tries to hide how touched he is but cant completely
whats the matter with you
forget how to open a car door
bobby recovers opens his own door gets in the front seat next to kenny
jesus you rich people
kenny starts up the engine
bobby smiles a twisted smile
as the car pulls away the two men sit in silence neither willing to admit how glad the other is there
the limo wheels out into the street carrying the two friends into the darkness
bobby stares out the window at the passing city the lights the lives behind those windows
as the car drives on and on the tension returns
bobby feels the weight of all those lives
a long beat
he gazes at kenny the only man he could ever admit this to i dont know if i can do this
kenny glances over at him
bobby stares back
theres nobody else id rather have going in there
bobby looks at him
nobody else id trust helen and the kids lives to
kenny means it
he looks away
bobby shifts awkward
take a left
kenny looks him
this isnt the way to the justice department
but he complies
we gave so much to get here
i dont know
sometimes i think what the hell did we do it for
because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else
and bobby in the silence and closeness of the car turns on kenny anguished knowing his life is at its climax
i hate being called the brilliant one
the ruthless one
they guy who does the dirty work
the one everybodys afraid of
kenny looks to him moved not knowing what to say
i hate it
im not smart you know
and im not so ruthless
he looks to kenny searching his face then away embarrassed
youre right about the smart part but ruthless well
that breaks the tension as they arrive at the scene appears the grim square lines of the soviet embassy
police cars line the streets outside it
all the windows are dark
a cordon of kgb guards in plainclothes stand by the gated entrance
on the opposite side of the street lounge two dozen washington d
kenny gives bobby a look
bobby rolls down his window
just wanted to see for myself
beat theyre burning their documents
the final duty of an embassy before war
they think were going to war
g d help us ken
the camera lifts away from the limo turning toward the embassy past the guards past the brass plate which reads embassy of the united soviet socialist republics up and up
to the roof where black reeking smoke billows from all of the embassys several chimneys
the camera races into it
it engulfs us all
kenny squeals the limo up to the curb in front of the justice department
the doors fly open and kenny and bobby jump out head up the steps to the building
bobbys staffers greet them as they stride down the hall staffer taking bobbys coat
sir ambassador dobrynin is already here
we have him waiting in your office
they reach the double oak doors to bobbys suite and stop
bobby faces kenny
ill whistle up some luck for you
and before kennys eyes all of bobbys doubt vanishes
in its place a severe confidence
a grandeur kenny has never seen
it makes kenny pause
he beholds his best friend become a man of the ages
and then bobby smoothly opens the door
and a door shuts oc like a threshold of history
hold on bobbys waiting room
heavy drapes framing dark windows
and abandoned secretarys desk
a row of sofas and chairs on either side of the room
two doorways one at either end of the room
a woman sits in one of the chairs for visitors
dressed in gray
a secretary of some sort
one of the double doors to the hall swings silently open
kenny glides in
he sees the other door shut at the far end of the room
kenny crashes in one of the chairs to wait
hold on the scene motionless silent
kenny whistles two notes
and then he begins to whistle the irish tune odonnell aboo
he gets a bar into it and theres a polite soft cough
then notices the woman in gray across the room
he didnt see her
its dim over there
she looks at him expressionless
the camera finds a pin on her lapel
a red hammer and kenny reacts
his opposite number
or more than a friend
here is the face of the enemy
not a smile between them
kenny resumes his ease
and begins to whistle again
the haunting irish song echoes in the vaulted ceiling filling the dim room
strange sad beautiful
the woman listens
and her face begins to soften
kenny stares at the dark lonely windows his song striving to fill the empty room
kenny sinks deeper in the chair his tune all consuming
and the womans voice breaks in
kenny stops looks over
her voice is tremulous and beautiful
just a snatch of some song in russian
she stops awkward
the woman stares back
but in their eyes they each see the others fear the others beauty the others humanity
so this is the enemy
who are you
kenny glances to the door
he considers for a long moment
kenny breaks the gaze
he begins to whistle again
the camera drifts away finding the far door to the inner office kennys tune stronger carrying with it hope
to the other side of that door
dobrynin sits in a chair opposite bobby behind his desk
the room is equally dim
and far more tense
and then the faintest strain of odonnell aboo
dobrynin glances briefly over his shoulder at the door
but bobby unseen by dobrynin cant help the flicker of a private smile
its kennys presence and bobby is the stronger for it
and then the tune is gone
bobby leans forward cool controlled masterful
ambassador dobrynin we are aware that at this moment your missiles in cuba are at the brink of operational readiness
floodlights illuminate missiles vertical on their erectors support vehicles clustered across the man made clearing
mask wearing technicians wave a fuel truck back to the nearest missile
clouds of toxic vapor rise from the others
theyve already been fueled
they are a vital threat to my country
if launched they would kill million americans
dobrynin listens impassively as is his professional duty
my brother my friends my countrymen and i cannot and will not permit those missiles to become operational
beat i promise you that
dobrynin looks out the window
and then pained looks back at bobby
then i fear our two nations will go to war
and i fear where war will lead us
bobby acknowledges him with a nod
if the missiles do not become operational if you remove the missiles then there will be no war
beat at this moment the president is accepting the terms of secretary khruschevs letter of friday night
if the soviet union halts construction immediately removes the missiles and submits to u
inspection the united states will pledge to never invade cuba or aid others in that enterprise
dobrynin stares at bobby
if your jupiter missiles in turkey were removed also such an accommodation could be reached
the two men move their argument forward with the deliberation and formality of chess masters
tired sounding the united states cannot agree to such terms under threat
any belief to the contrary beat was in error
dobrynin reels internally
the only sign on his face is a slight tremor
bobby looks up registers the calculated effect
and to dobrynins horror the russian believes you want war
but not so fast
bobby folds his hands
and he smoothly goes from hard ass brinksman to sensitive deal maker
however while there can be no quid pro quo on this issue the united states can offer a private assurance
dobrynin holds his breath
our jupiter missiles in turkey are obsolete and have been scheduled for withdrawal for some time
this withdrawal should be completed within say six months
dobrynin lets out his breath
of course any public disclosure of this assurance would negate the deal and produce the most stringent denials from our government
dobrynin grasps the move immediately understanding the ramifications
still he hesitates a moment
this private assurance represents the word of the highest authority
and it can be relayed beyond comrade khruschevs ears to the top circles of my government of course
our pledge can be relayed to any government official secretary khruschev sees fit to satisfy
meaning this is the bone he can show the hard line
dobrynin struggles internally knowing what bobby has done wanting to hug him
it comes across as agitation
with the caveat that it is not made public in any way shape or form
beat and we must have an answer tomorrow at the latest
i cannot stress this point enough
dobrynin rises from his chair
bobby rises with him
then you must excuse me and permit me to relay the substance of our discussion to my superiors
dobrynin heads for the door
half way there he turns back to bobby deeply moved
we have heard stories that some among your military men wish for war
beat you are a good man
your brother is a good man
i assure you there are other good men
let us hope the will of good men is enough to counter the terrible strength of this thing which has been put in motion
kenny enters the oval office through his side door
the office is dark only the desk lamp on
kennys gaze moves over the trappings of power the carpet with the presidential seal the rocking chair by the fireplace the desk
and on the desk tucked almost out of sight sits a small humble wooden plaque
its turned to face the occupant of the chair behind the desk
kenny reaches out turns it around
it is the bretons fishermans prayer
it reads oh lord thy sea is great my boat so small
were out here
kenny holds on the plaque a beat and looks up at the open french door to the rose garden
the curtains swirl around him in the wind as he goes through the door and out onto the portico
standing there in the dark by the white neoclassical pillars of the cloister are bobby and the president
theyre holding drinks
kenny joins them
the president gestures out across the south lawn to the gleaming washington monument
we were just debating who had it worse us or george washington and his guys
he didnt have to worry about nuclear weapons
yeah but the country didnt even exist as a country yet
it was a mess and he didnt have a leg to stand on
all he had was his character
the president and bobby nod at the justice of that remark
how does a guy get a rep like that
doesnt matter to me
if i went down in history like adams id die happy
all they say about him today is he kept the peace
kenny looks at the president
the president feels it and gazes back to him
the three of them stare out at the glittering city
the grandness of the world lies before them and they are deciding its fate and are humbled by the awfulness of it
the silence is beyond power
and for a long moment they know not to disturb it
there is nothing left to say
the president at last finishes his drink
you know we never did control it
not like we think
he looks at kenny
he knows that now too
but we did our best
now its up to them
kennys limo pulls away leaving kenny coat in hand at the bottom of his driveway
he watches it go silently urging it to return for him with some call from the president telling him hes desperately needed
but it doesnt
he turns to his house
the lights are all out
he notices hes clutching the handle of his briefcase
his knuckles are white
with conscious effort he unfolds his hand letting the briefcase drop on the driveway
he stands alone stripped of his friends his family his job
and in that moment mute impotent in the shadow of armageddon kenny is our everyman of the nuclear age
helen stands in the kitchen a ghostly white figure in her robe the windows open and curtain flapping as she breathes the air
he stands in the doorway
i saw you out there
you want him to call you back need you
im glad im home
and she knows the worst
how long do we have
kennys voice breaks
if the sun rises in the morning it is only because of men of goodwill
beat and thats all there is between us and the devil
they take each other in their arms the wisdom of the atomic age so simple so tenuous every human life hanging by such a thread
yet a thread so powerful
the camera rises from them finding the open window and the darkness
the red dome of nuclear fire rising over washington
it roils the air in its expanding blood red glory
it is the sun
the dawn in the east
into kenny and helens bedroom
kenny and helen lie together on the bed
the light burns into kennys half shut eye
kenny is only dimly conscious of the lights meaning
until the phone shrills downstairs
kenny is instantly up launched out of the room
kenny snatches the red phone from its hook
the church bells toll in raucous celebration
kenny helen and the five odonnell kids join the throng packing through the doors to the church
theyre all smiling except kenny who searches fro faces in the crowd
and then he spots bobby with his family
bobby grins at him
that makes kenny grin back
this is radio moscow
but kenny keeps looking
the following statement is the text of a letter from general secretary khruschev to president kennedy
kenny spots him emerging from the presidential limo surrounded by secret service agents john kennedy
his family also is with him
i regard with respect and trust the statement you made in your message of october that there would be no attack no invasion of cuba and not only the part
of the united states but also on the part of the western hemisphere as you said in your same message
then the motives which induced us to render assistance of such a kind to cuba disappear
kennedy greeting well wishers a brilliant smile on his face is carried through the crowd toward kenny and the doors of the church
it is for this reason that we have instructed our officers these missiles as i already informed you are in the hands of soviet officers to take appropriate measures to
discontinue construction dismantle them and return them to the soviet union
the base has been half dismantled over night
fuel trucks pull away lumping down the makeshift dirt road
across the site missiles are lowered their nose cones being removed
a missile on its transporter technicians crawling all over it covering it with a tarp
a massive soviet helicopters rotors thunder as it lifts off cargo crates swaying under it a cloud of dust from its wash excom laughing celebrating half drunk already this sunday
the president shushes the group
okay thats enough
the group quiets down
the presidents stares at them calm firm
they sober up quickly
kenny listens expectant
i dont want any gloating
this is not a victory over the soviets
its a victory with the soviets
beat i want everyone to remember that
kenny rounds a corner
mcnamara bundy and mccone are talking excited hushed standing to one side down the hall
kenny eyes them as he draws closer and then they notice hes approaching
bundy nods him over confidential
weve been talking
we can play this big in
its the foreign policy trophy weve been waiting
he tries to listen but it all begins to blur
i think we can ride it all the way home next election
bet youre way ahead of us eh
bundy slaps kenny on the back
kenny is pale
is what theyre saying possible
but bundy and mccone are too wrapped up in their schemes to notice kennys distress
weve ordered crash reassessment of our major geopolitical hotspots
weve got a lot of new clout and we can run the table on the soviets
middle east southeast asia
and kenny sad moved beyond all pity and loathing realizes it is possible
they havent gotten it
he is speechless helplessly shaking his head
bundy finally sees something isnt right with him
whats wrong odonnell
kenny cant speak
cant find the words
but tongue tied finally manages dont you understand
mcnamara and bundy look at him funny
kenny just looks at them eyes filled with sorrow
they begin to feel uncomfortable
the sun came up today
it shouldnt have
but it did
we were lucky we were able to keep it under control
kenny looks away unable to bear it
every day the sun comes up
says something about us
says what kenny
kenny looks back at them
they just stare at him
and with secret smiles superior smiles they nod
feels good to win doesnt it
but they dont understand and together turn away
see you later kenny
kenny watches them heads bowed in discussion disappear into the labyrinth of the west wing
kenny turns his back on them
the president stands at his mirror tying a bow tie to a tux for some sunday special event
kenny gathers up his folder from nearby breakfast table
kenny meets the presidents gaze in the mirror and the two men know they have been to the same mountaintop
kenny stands straight ready for action ready for some necessary thing
ready to go back into the game
see you around kenny
kenny starts to leave but at the door turns back
the president looks at him in the mirror
this was what were here for
the president smiles an ever so faint smile
kenny turns and leaves the room vanishing and as we hold on the empty doorway the simple whistled melody of odonnell aboo drifts from the hallway beyond becoming our end
shortly after the crisis president kennedy ordered a reassessment of u
soviet relations ushering a brief thaw in the cold war
during this time the washington moscow hotline was installed to ensure that in a future crisis miscommunication would not lead to nuclear war
the president was assassinated on november nd a year after the crisis ended
bobby kennedy ran for president in
after winning the california primary he called kenny from the ambassador hotel in los angeles and told him i finally feel like im out from under my brothers shadow
bobby was assassinated minutes later
the members of excom continued to serve with distinction in government in various capacities over the next three decades
as lyndon johnsons secretary of defense robert mcnamara urged containment of the soviet threat in every theatre of conflict around the world
he ultimately advised president johnson to increase the u
military commitment to one of these minor backwater conflicts vietnam
kenny odonnell witnessed the presidents assassination from the car behind
he went on to head the peace platform at the democratic national convention fighting to end the vietnam war
he died in
