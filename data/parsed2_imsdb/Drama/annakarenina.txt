written by tom stoppard based on the novel by leo tolstoy
close expert fingers female unlovely capable shape a small lump of dough which with some shreds of cabbage becomes a filled bun called a pirozhok
which is now placed on a baking tray to join rows of pirozhoki ready for the oven
close one hand opens the oven and mittened by an apron removes a tray of perfectly baked pirozhoki which the other hand replaces with the fresh tray
slightly burning itself on a knuckle
agafia sucks her knuckle and checks whats cooking on the stove top
she is the cook housekeeper
he needs to come in if hes to wash himself
a kitchen maid at the sink obediently dries her hands on her apron
a dozing dog laska pricks up her ears
the kitchen maid shawled with a lantern makes her way across the yard towards the cowshed a short distance and pushes open the frozen door
laska is at her heels but is made to stay outside
the herd stirs at the lantern light
the bull berkut with a ring through his nose snorts as the girl goes by
at the back of the shed a cow is calving
levin is midwifing sleeves pulled back blood and slime up to his elbows
his steward vasili holds up a lantern
levin pulls carefully at the emerging forefeet
good girl pava
the calfs head emerges
agafia mishaylovna says dinners like to spoil
the calf enters the world like a diver
levin is feeling great pride and pleasure
her fathers colour
worth coming home for konstantin dmitrich
i stayed too long in moscow
the cow nuzzles and licks her calf
cleaned up in a smock shirt levin bites hungrily into a pirozhok talking
he has a book on a book rest
agafia ladles soup for him
three generations of family portraits look down on him
shes a beauty
thats twelve cows sired by berkut
so one of you is doing what the good lord made you for
levin evades ducks into spooning up soup finding his place in his book
agafia goes out
alone levin closes the book and stares into himself
close expert fingers scrape a cut throat razor across a lathered cheek
and again skirting luxuriant facial hair on pampered skin
there is a door to the landing and a door to the bedroom
prince stepan oblonsky stiva to his friends is and liked by every body
a barber comes in every morning to shave him
his valet matvey is older and almost a friend
he holds up an enormous pear
what should i do with this
oblonsky puts the barber on hold to have a look
where did you find it
in your hat
oblonsky thinks about it lets the barber finish
he stands and removes his dressing gown
i picked it up somewhere for daria alexandrovna and the children
matvey is ready with oblonskys shirt which he puts over his masters head like a horses collar
there is a sloping lineup of five children aged eight five four three and two dressed and brushed for presentation to their mother princess daria oblonsky known as dolly
who we now see is heavily pregnant
stand ing by is a french governess mlle
roland and a nurse
roland is buxom
dolly picks up the youngest vasya to kiss him and hands him to the nurse and kisses the others in ascending order
bonjour lili bonjour masha bonjour grisha bonjour tanya
whos coming to see grandmama
oblonsky dressed now and holding a cup of coffee checks from the window
dolly in furs the four youngest children and the nurse who carries vasya all wrapped up against the cold weather have come out of the house to a waiting sleigh
as noisy as starlings bickering competing reprimanding
the oblonskys coachman assists with a rug to spread across knees
oblonsky hands his coffee to matvey and lights a small cigar
he detours to take a sugared almond from a dish of sweets and leaves the room
tanya is at her lessons with mlle
when oblonskys face appears smiling round the door tanya jumps up and runs to him greeting him laughing kissing his face hanging on his neck
mind my cigar
he pops the sugared almond into her mouth and puts a conspiratorial finger to his lips
roland who has stood up for him clucks in reprimand
be good today
tanya runs back to her seat and bends to her schoolbook
oblonsky looks mlle
roland in the eye
he moves his head slightly unmistakably ask ing her to come outside
roland moves her eyes at him in humorous reproach
clearly this is familiar ground
oblonsky closes the door behind him
roland read the chapter carefully
ill come back to test you on it
read it twice
close pretty fingers put on several rings and then pick up a faberge jade paper knife to slit an envelope and withdraw a letter
it is early in the day
annas maid annushka has been dressing anna
annushka is young loyal modest
anna is at her dressing table bureau which is host to at least two pho tographs of a small boy serozha and a childs unframed drawing of maman
as she starts reading the letter annas eyes frown
oblonsky and mlle
roland in a passionate embrace vertical clothed
anna turns the page reads on concerned
still kissing oblonsky hoists up her skirts
anna turns to the second page
oblonsky coming in quietly and late from a night on the town enters his dressing room
he smiles a foolish apologetic smile
dolly is waiting for him shocked enraged holding out a billet doux on pink paper a love note
anna speaks as in exasperation to a naughty child
and dolly found a note from the governess
anna is speaking to her husband confidentially
karenin a busy man drains his coffee cup and hands it as with oblonsky and matvey to his valet korney who bows and withdraws
karenin continues transferring papers from his desk to his portfolio
which done he nods to his private secretary mikhail slyudin who comes forward to receive it bows and leaves
karenin is twenty years older than anna and a senior figure in govern ment
he has an unattractive reedy voice and is pleased with himself as a model of probity
he has the habit of cracking his knuckles
stiva wants me to come to moscow
to persuade dolly to forgive him
im to be deprived of my wife so that adul tery may be forgiven
i cant excuse him just because hes your brother
its for dollys sake too
has to go i have four committees today
there is another interruption serozha aged seven and a half and his tutor vasily lukich enter for a ritual good morning
serozha is a little frightened of his father but the mother and son are in love
anna goes straight to serozha her heart lifted to hug him
i have the world waiting for me theres never time to look at your exercises
sergei alexeyich is doing very well your excellency
a button missing tsk tsk who put this shirt on you
ill come and hear you read
thank you lukich perhaps tomorrow
anna goes with serozha relinquishing him finally
she closes the door on them
alexei do you think nine years of mar riage and children should count for nothing against a
karenin cracks his knuckles concedes
kisses her hand but sin has a price you may be sure of that
oblonsky has been bunking down on his couch
he moans and groans
he gets up and tries the door to the bedroom
he knocks timidly
please think of the children
he listens hopefully
the other door leading to the upper landing is opened violently by dolly
you think of the children
their lives are ruined now
she slams the door behind her
oblonsky comes out of his dressing room to see the main bedroom door slammed
he attempts to go in but the door is locked
i beg you
matvey come to the top of the stairs with a telegram
should i send up the barber
no just the razor
oblonsky tears open the telegram
dont worry sir things will shape them selves youll see
my sister annas coming tomorrow
inner doors open and oblonsky comes out of his private office
he is his genial self
everyone in the general office minor officials clerks stands up for him and bows
oblonsky is wearing government uniform green coat with gold embroidery on the collar instead of his own coat
oblonsky is helped out of one coat into the other
some man came without an appointment your excellency
oblonsky opens the door to look
levin is sitting waiting on a bench wear ing a sheepskin coat cap and scuffed boots
where did you disappear
he seizes levin and kisses him
im very anxious to see you
i need your advice
well then come into my room
oblonsky leads levin back through the general office where everyone stands up again
levins sheepskin and boots attract curious glances
this is my oldest friend konstantin dmit rich levin
someone send word ill be a few minutes late
oblonsky leads levin inside and closes the door
ive been hard at it
levin undoes his coat and sits down
hard at what exactly
why were overwhelmed with work
paperwork is the soul of russia
farming is only the stomach
when am i going to come and shoot some snipe
seeing the clothes levin is wearing he laughs
oh but look at you in western clothes you told me youd never wear again
some things up
im in love
ive come back to propose
have you guessed who she is
rolls his eyes comically i have a suspicion
why didnt you propose when you were here
i decided it was impossible
kitty is of the heavens an angel and i am of the earth but then i thought and thought and
theres no life for me without her
do i have a chance
of course you do
the shcherbatskys are giving a soiree this evening
get there early before the crowd
if i may suggest
wed better have dinner together
come on well meet later at langleterre
or do you prefer the hermitage
oblonsky ushers levin back into the general office
everyone stands up as before
the doorkeeper produces oblonskys top coat and helps him into it
no five thirty at langleterre i owe them more than the hermitage so it wouldnt be fair to withdraw my custom
taking his hat boots and a coat
and a proper hat
he ushers levin out
firstly a moscow street scene busy with people going about their business on foot and in conveyances
secondly levin approaches langleterre in his new fur collared coat top hat and boots
oblonsky and levin preside over the debris of three dozen oysters with champagne in a bucket to hand
oblonsky is in a maudlin mood afloat on champagne
its so unfair
you marry for love youre a good husband
and all of a sudden your wife is tired her hair is thin her body
while you yourself still have your
and you find yourself distracted by a pretty woman
forgive me but i find that incomprehen sible
as though id leave this restaurant and steal a roll from a bakers shop
well you know a freshly baked roll
but im talking about love and youre talk ing about
now look do you know count vronsky
hes your rival
he turned up from st
petersburg after you left
who is he
you dont have to worry about him
hes one of those rich good looking cavalry offi cers whove got nothing to do but make love to pretty women
a waiter arrives to remove the oyster shells while an elderly waiter places a bowl of soup in front of levin and a lobster in front of oblonsky
potage aux choux a la russe as the gentle man ordered
its what i wanted
the waiter departs
understand that for me tonight is a ques tion of life and death
kitty would be mad to refuse you
and dolly is on your side you know
she says her sister kitty was always meant to be your wife and will be
levin jumps up in elation collects himself and sits
dolly said that
ive always thought your dollys a gem
oh she is she is
i loved her to distraction
a little out of focus and further obscured by puffs of steam the wheels of a locomotive and its tender plus a carriage or two with part of the superstructure
the whole kit and caboodle turning out to be a rich childs table top model railway go by the camera like a wipe revealing the momentarily gigantic face of anna
who is crouching down to watch the toy go by
serozha is at present snivelling
because thats where aunt dolly lives
i told you serozha
shes not well
i must go to see her
now dont make mama cry
ill be back before you know and bring you a present
dont want a present
i want you to stay
anna is on the brink of tears
my little kutik
she dabs her eyes
kapitonich the karenins hall porter an old soldier comes out of the house to where a private carriage is waiting
the coachman is konrad
anna comes out with annushka who has a large soft bag containing everything her mistress needs for the journey
kapitonich holds the carriage door for them
anna has a window seat
next to her is annushka
in the opposite window seat is countess vronsky at sixty losing the battle to keep her youthful beauty
she has a lap dog and perhaps a faberge topped walking cane
next to her is her maid
anna is not happy to be leaving
she holds a small framed photo of sero zha which she then puts away in her red bag
countess vronsky smiles at her
anna wipes her eyes explains
its the first time ive left my little boy
so you are leaving your son and i am return ing to mine
i am countess vronsky
anna knows the name
countess vronsky contd ive been in st
petersburg for the christen ing of a granddaughter my elder son mar ried princess chirkov
youre a charming creature
why dont i know you
ive never been in moscow society really
but you know my name
ive heard you mentioned
talked about you mean
anna found out smiles tentatively
was it love
my sons are ashamed of me
but id rather end up wishing i hadnt than end up wishing i had wouldnt you
i dont know
anna looks at the snow on the window
she is unsettled by the conversation
a sleigh i
a cab brings levin
the hall porter lets levin into the house
a footman takes levins hat and coat
levin is uneasy he seems to be first to arrive
he decides he has come too early
he pulls his coat back from the footman
ill come back
princess ekaterina kitty shcherbatsky is eighteen
eager to see who has arrived she hurries from the direction of the reception room and looks down into the entrance hall in time to see levin snatch his hat
back from the footman
im too early
kitty runs off out of levins view
he flings his hat and coat at the foot man and runs up the stairs
levin hurries in and finds kitty seated prettily in a receiving pose
she is alone
look at me
im receiving for papa and maman who are late to dress
its my first reception
levin plays along kissing her hand elaborately
im so pleased you were able to be with us konstantin dmitrich
you look stiva told us you were back
how long are you staying
i dont know
it depends on you
he has got ahead of himself
doors are flung open and the hosts prince and princess shcherbatsky and a crowd of guests who have arrived together are greeting each other
levin has to make a quick decision and he makes the wrong one to go on
what i mean to say i came with only one purpose i want to will you be my wife
a wave of guests is almost upon her
im sorry sorry wrong moment but will you
levin seems stunned surrounded now by greetings laughter and servants with trays of drinks
it was impossible
prince and princess shcherbatsky receive a young married member of kittys set countess nordston
and introduce levin who hears and sees noth ing
he turns away leaving the countess hung out to dry
levin finds himself face to face with burisov a silky officer in sky blue uniform who introduces himself
are you the brother of nikolai levin
hes in moscow hes staying at the unicorn in khitrovka
how do you know
its the sort of thing i know
he bows to levin and turns away to greet someone
levin reacts decides to leave
he makes for the door
he nearly collides with someone gives and receives an apology and suddenly understands who this man in guards uniform must be
levin pauses awkwardly
vronsky hesitates bows and continues on
levin witnesses kitty seeing vronsky approaching and sees her face light up
vronsky kisses her hand
its been so long and yet it seems like yesterday
his banter is lost on her
she laughs happily
it was yesterday
levin turns away and leaves
levin comes out of the grand house where several coaches are waiting
hum bled and angry with himself and the world he takes off his top hat and considers putting his fist through it but jams it back on his head
a horse cab comes along
levin waves it down
a mean street an area of poverty and crime
levin pays off his cab
levin goes up a dimly lit dingy staircase
snatches of music and sing ing drift up the stairs
levin knocks at a door then louder
the door is flung open
nikolai levin is the spirit of consumptive bohemian radicalism
he peers at levin surprised
nikolai roars with laughter which turns to wheezing
god look at him
you look like a capitalist
what do you want
i came to see you
nikolai goes back into the room shouting for masha
levin follows him
levin sees that he is in a tiny apartment
a young woman looks at him fearfully from the inner doorway
good evening miss
dont talk to her like that
it frightens her
you sound like a magistrate
shouts at her more vodka for my brother quick about it
i dont want anything
masha goes to nikolai and whispers to him calming him
im all right
he fills a wineglass with vodka and gulps it greedily
who told you where to find me
a colonel in the third department
theyre watching you
they must think im dangerous
levin involuntarily smiles at the self puffery
what have you got to smile about
the day is coming
i gave up my birthright for it
youre on the wrong side of history
not because privilege is immoral but because its irrational
wheezing he goes for the bottle again
masha tries to take it from him appealing to levin
he is sick
let go or ill beat your lights out
he pushes her away and pours himself more vodka
i took mary nikolova from a brothel but i consider her my wife
if her presence offends you youre free to leave
are you married
are you waiting to fall in love
romantic love will be the last illu sion of the old order
you should marry one of your peasants
levins reaction is almost violent surprising nikolai
i damn well should
toasts casually the brotherhood of man
levin recovers himself
he takes out his wallet
nikolai you have to see a doctor
then come and stay with me at pokrovskoe till you get your health back
with my wife
levin becomes flustered
or go abroad to a spa
ill send you more if thats what you
masha reaches for the money levin has put on the table
nikolai knocks her hand away
he throws the banknotes at levin
he coughs himself into a paroxysm
levin tries to embrace him
nikolai throws him off
what about the brotherhood of brothers
masha snatches up the banknotes
there is a scattering of people of all classes on the platform waiting for the arriving train
by the entrance exit gate a guards officer stands holding a bouquet
the stationmaster stands by
a strip of faded red carpet has been laid on the planks
the private coach will stop opposite the carpet
the guards officer nods
he sees vronsky arriving
hello whats this
austrian royalty on their honeymoon
ive got them for four days
what do they like
heres the train
vronsky moves closer to the slowing train scanning the windows going by
the guards officer and the stationmaster are disconcerted to see the obvious private coach stop seriously short or long behind luggage wagons etc
ill see to it
he hurries away towards the engine
oblonsky hurries through relieved not to be late
vronsky is saluted by his mothers major domo a tall man in livery with a cockade
second carriage your excellency
ill see to the countesss luggage and bring it on to the house
vronsky nods and makes his way towards the second coach against the flow of disembarked passengers
the stationmaster speaks to the engine driver
the guards officer with the bouquet stands uncertainly while arriving passengers go past him
the royal austrian honeymooners peer anxiously through the window
countess vronsky remains sitting
annushka packs away annas blanket and pillow
anna looks out of the window
ill come back
anna moves to the door opening on to the porch
vronsky is on the point of entering
he steps back to allow her by
they barely exchange a glance as she passes him but simultaneously each of them looks back
anna looks away quickly
his look lingers before he turns away to enter the carriage
anna from her vantage point spots oblonsky calls to him
annushka with her bag comes onto the porch and descends to follow her mistress
anna steps down to the platform and embraces oblonsky
they are delighted to see each other
you dont look ashamed
i am i really am
countess vronsky remains in her seat
vronsky bends at the window look ing at oblonsky and anna
yes of course
charmante dont you think
to her maid wait for me in the carriage
ill take tosca
she takes the dog
the maid leaves with her bag
you stayed longer in st
long enough for you to start a little love affair i hear
i cant think what youre referring to maman
he glances back to the window where anna turns back to enter the train
as anna turns back a railwayman with a hammer for tapping wheels is in her way
he steps back for her with a bow and a madame
anna glances at him and moves past him
the man taps a wheel making a ring ing sound which means the wheel is okay
as anna mounts the steps a train guard looks up and down the plat form holding a green flag
anna enters from the porch
there countess you have found your son and i have found my brother
madame karenin has a son too
its the first time they have been apart so she frets about him
excuse me for not recognizing you before
we passed the time telling each other about our sons
yes ive been hearing all about you
that must have been very boring for you
the ringing sound of the wheel tappers hammer is faintly audible in annas hesitation
anna shuts off the gallantry
au revoir countess
au revoir my dear
let me kiss your pretty face
countess vronsky does so
anna turns to offer her hand to vronsky
as vronsky takes her hand the train lurches and moves unsteadying them both
oblonsky and everyone still on the platform is shocked by a dreadful scream and shouting
the train having moved a few feet stops
oblonsky hurries towards the scene of the accident right opposite the gate
the station master overtakes him
the wheel tapper lies between the wheels mangled
oblonsky joins the horrified onlookers
the guards officer arrives too with his bouquet
then vronsky arrives
he turns to the guards officer
keep your people inside until this has been cleared up
countess vronsky vronsky anna and oblonsky oblonsky almost in tears come towards the gate
a porter follows with annas large suitcase hat boxes etc
annushka has the travelling bag
the sole support of a large family they say
cant anything be done for them
vronsky glances at her
wait for me maman
vronsky retraces his steps
ive you to thank for that
she knows her son
anna hasnt understood but when oblonsky looks back he sees vronsky with the stationmaster taking money from his wallet
what a good fellow
anna catches on doesnt like it
have you known count vronsky long
did you like him
hes in love with kitty
but we should be discussing you and dolly
she scolds him like a naughty boy
what have you got to say for yourself
ive said it all on my knees in tears
now i need you to say it
im going to the office so youll have dolly to yourself
dont be home late
dolly pours tea for anna
dolly smiles at her wanly brightly
kittys coming by to see you
shes all grown up and a bit frightened of you the belle of st
is that who i am
stiva has told me
dolly bursts into tears
anna embraces her
dolly im sorry from the bottom of my heart
i dont know what to do
i know i know
i cant bear to be with him
and he doesnt care hes got what he wants
what he wants is you
he loves you dolly
you and the children are everything to him
and there is room for a governess
that was shameful disgraceful
but it was not love
it was the animal in man not the soul
stivas remorse is from the soul
what about me
does his remorse make it easier for me
i know you are suffering
but dolly you must tell me
is there enough love left in your heart
enough to forgive him
when i think of them together i cant for give him no
my poor lamb
so youd rather accept your fate
but i havent done anything
its him do you love him dolly
dolly nods tearfully
you love him and he loves you but you cant forgive so your lives must continue like this for ever with both of you wretched
anna kitty tanya and grisha are at a handsome card table where board games dominoes cards etc
there is a spill of alphabet bricks each with a letter printed in it
they are spelling out their names in alphabet bricks
grisha is on annas lap pulling at her hair
the spelling business including misspellings by grisha creates a noise of laughter and mock rebuke
tanya at the same time is trying to pull a ring from annas finger
kitty is not at all frightened of anna now enraptured by her laughing
grisha dont pull so hard youre getting it all in a tangle and look for another g for she takes off her ring for tanya here darling you can wear
it till you go dolly sits apart embroidering
she looks up at the sound of voices down stairs oblonsky coming home
the children hear their father and abandon the card table running out to greet him
dolly stands up to leave by a dif ferent door giving anna a collusive glance
anna pushes aside the alphabet bricks
well thats the end of that
will you stay for the bobrishchevs ball anna
i always feel dull at a ball
how can you ever be dull
oblonsky arrives in the doorway with tanya and grisha hanging on him
tell anna she must come to the ball
of course she must
he cocks an eye at anna how did it go with dolly
anna moves her head upstairs
and god go with you
kitty catches the moment
you can introduce me to your new governess
shes a hundred
which leaves anna and kitty alone
i know why you want me to come
you want everyone to be there because youre sure its going to be your night
how did you know
annas smile is her acting out a mock mysteriousness
i know everything
she has moved alphabet letters around to spell out vronsky
she laughs at kittys tearful joyful nodding genuinely happy for kitty
oh to be your age again
surrounded by that blue mist like mist on the mountains that clears slowly to reveal the terrifying beautiful valley you must enter to become grown up
i was eighteen too when i got married
a quiet note of regret hangs in the air between them for a moment before anna dispels it
with only a lamp or two lit and the door open anna sits alone at the card table with a neglected book one hand playing idly with the alpha bet
their pleasant clicks are the only sound as she remains lost in thought
she closes her book marking the place
she is going to go up to bed
she hears the sound of the doorbell
vronsky has been let in spattered with snow
no your excellency
hes just gone up
the princess retired early
is there a message
vronsky glances up and sees anna looking down
their eyes meet
a second passes
vronsky is about to speak
anna turns away and moves out of his view towards further stairs with her book
levin is coming home in a sleigh driven by his one eyed coachman ignat
he is huddled under a bearskin blanket
the house is in sight
the sleigh overtakes a peasant woman serafina walking to the house car rying a big bundle of willow wands strapped to her back a strong young woman with a handsome
she stops and bows her head
levin looks at her
she then looks him in the face
laska barking joyfully races from the house
the bathhouse has a stove which heats water
there is a brazier to create instant steam but not now
levin almost naked lies on a plank deck thoughtful staring at something
no at someone serafina who is put ting on her clothes
she has no angst
dressed she crosses herself
will you go to confession
serafina nods indifferently
god will forgive you
and you also master
he is watching
god forgive us then for committing the act of love
she nods without irony
he is merciful
not according to my deserts o lord but according to thy mercy thats a fine prayer
but im full of doubt
sometimes i even doubt that god exists
how can there be anything if god didnt make it
i dont know
one day science will tell us
thats sinful talk if the priest heard you
well i wont go to confession
your father built the church
youre con fessed a while yet
levin feels outplayed
will you bring me something from moscow
what would you like
soap the kind wrapped in paper to look pretty and smelling like for a proper lady
levin is touched
kitty enters the ball a proper lady
this is a gilded affair conducted by a master of ceremonies
the host and hostess are positioned to welcome each guest
dancing has started a waltz
kitty and her parents enter the ballroom and are received by their hosts
everything has come together for kitty her dress her hair her skin her moment
she radiates happiness
an officer stands aside to let them pass openly admiring kitty smoothing his moustache
a youth having trouble with his white tie hurries past but turns back to kitty
may i have a waltz
you may boris
ill save you the third just because its your first ball
youre my first conquest
the master of ceremonies korsunsky arrives and without permission sweeps her into the waltz
its a relaxation to dance with you princess
kitty sees anna arriving with oblonsky and gives a little gasp at her god given beauty
but back to work
where do you want to be taken
korsunsky waltzes her brilliantly through the dancers and twirls her to rest in front of a small group including anna and oblonsky floating kittys train
so that your ankles may be seen
anna appraises kitty at a glance and gives her a tiny nod signifying top marks
how are you stiva
thanks to anna i am a happy man
would you like to dance
no ask anna
she looks up and sees vronsky coming straight towards her
come on then
just as vronsky is about to bow she takes oblonskys arm and he whirls her away
kitty smiles for vronsky but his eyes have followed anna know ing she cut him
he remembers himself after an awkward hiatus
kittys mother and father are watching from afar
he invites her into the waltz
this vile idiotic matchmaking of yours
for goodness sake what have i done
levin is a thousand times better than this petersburg fop
if he had royal blood my daughter wouldnt need him
vronskys mind is absent and the waltz ends after only a few steps
he stand waiting for the music to start
is anything the matter
as lovely as ever princess kitty
the music starts and they dance on
at the end of the waltz vronsky leaves kitty with her mother bows and departs
princess shcherbatsky is beginning to have doubts
she starts to ask
dont ask me maman
boris the youth pops up to claim his dance
dancing kitty sees vronsky talking to a couple of officers
she is anxious but not disillusioned
grumpy prince shcherbatsky is dancing with countess nordston
hell dance the mazurka with kitty youll see
i call the mazurka the now or never
anna watches the dancing
she rejects an offer with a smile
she sees vron sky and to her discomfort vronsky looks up and catches her looking
she turns away at once and notices that ladies are curtseying and men are bowing as the host and hostess escort an overweight but glittering young couple towards a decorative
buffet in an adjoining salon the austrian royal honeymooners
attended by the guards officer from the station
anna stands and curtseys as they pass by into the salon
where oblonsky is roaring with laughter champagne in hand
we were shut up in the train for an hour
anna steals a sidelong glance towards vronsky but he is no longer there
she looks for him among the dancers smiles at kitty going by with the enthusiastic inexpert boris
suddenly vronsky is at annas side
dance with me
i am not used to being spoken to like that by a man i met once at a railway station
i dare say but if im not to dance with you im getting out of this operetta and going home
then for kittys sake
she gives him her hand
kitty looks for vronsky cant see him then is taken aback to see him with anna
kitty watches anna dancing
anna says something which makes vronsky laugh
anna blossoms in front of kittys eyes
vron sky twirls anna around and she comes smiling into his arms
it goes on like that
kitty watches them from within the arms of young men old men from the wall
anna and vronsky dance slow they dance fast gaily solemnly gazes locked
others are noticing too countess nordston princess shcherbatsky and eagle eyed matrons
anna oblivious has found a release in herself
countess nordston finds kitty sitting alone
korsunsky announces the mazurka
youre not dancing the mazurka
i wont have it
she pulls kitty to her feet
countess nordston contd im engaged by general glub i give him to you
korsunsky supervises a large circle of couples who change partners as they go round with one couple dancing in the middle of the circle
the lady chooses a lady and a gentleman
the lady in the middle beckons to anna and the man who changing part ners happens to be dancing with her
they enter the middle where they have their solo turn as a couple while the original couple reenter the circum ference
anna is flushed with pleasure
among the surrounding dancers vronsky has no eyes for his partner only for anna
kitty dancing watches vronsky incredulous
and the lady chooses a lady and a gentleman
anna looks smilingly around the dancing circle and sees kitty staring at her
anna wakes up
everything which made her drunk makes her sober in the instant
she waits until the change of partners brings kitty and vronsky together
she beckons them into the middle
her own partner expects to re join the circumference with anna but she makes an apology and escapes through the circle running towards the door
with a howl and clatter the st
petersburg express seems to crash through the ballroom
an abstract nightmarish discordant noise of clattering and howling accompanies unexplained flame light on wood glass iron
blackness opens like a door on a blizzard of light and slams shut
annas face eyes closed floats ghostlike
anna comes to consciousness in the dimly lit carriage making sense of what seems like a hallucination
wind and snow batter on the window
the carriage stoker in long coat and cap deals with the stove clears frost off a thermometer on the wall
he leaves opening the door to snow and wind and slamming it behind him
the train speeds m
through a blizzard
anna has a reading lamp hooked over her armrest and a novel
she cuts a page with a paper knife
but the book cannot hold her
she is reading without taking it in
she turns back a page and tries again but almost at once she turns to the window where the dark reflection of her face looks back at her
kittys face staring as she stared at anna betrayed
anna turns away from the window
the guard comes through the door letting in wind and snow and shuts it
he walks through the carriage
the train is slowing
the train clanks to a halt at a small station
anna and a few others get down from the train
she wears a heavy cloak
the wind blows a few snowflakes through the station but the roof keeps off the snow
she is glad of the fresh air
here and there men are walking smoking laughing together
she feels better
a tall outline of a man in a greatcoat and military cap emerges from the flickering gloom
she catches her breath
he salutes her
can i be of service to you
i didnt know you were
why are you leaving
you know why
i have to be where you are
i cant not
this is wrong
if youre a good man forget everything that happened as i will
ill never forget a single thing about you not a word not a gesture thats enough
she climbs the steps on to the porch
at the door to the carriage she pauses
the encounter has left her feeling elated and frightened
the train arrives
vronsky gets down from the train and starts to walk towards annas carriage
his german valet franz runs up to him from second class
take the luggage home
franz runs back the other way
vronsky walks on then stops when he sees karenin waiting on the platform smiling and going forward to hand anna down the steps
kapitonich enters the carriage
is serozha all right
oh is that all i get
yes hes quite well
vronsky steps forward
anna knows hes there
she angles herself to avoid looking at him
did you have a good night
he bows to karenin
yes quite comfortable
karenin extends a hand indifferently then dismisses vronsky drawing anna with him
i have to get back to the committee
he walks anna away
well were you a success
oh dolly and stiva
yes i think so
vronsky watches them go
a snowy st
vronsky arrives home by cab
he has a flat in an old apartment block
vronsky rings the doorbell
a servant opens the door
a male voice shouts if its someone demanding money dont let him in
ill announce myself
veronsky enters the main room
the occupant of the flat is a nd lieuten ant petritsky wearing his greatcoat over shirt and trousers
the master himself
baroness coffee from the new coffeepot for count vronsky
petritsky indicates a pretty young woman in satin
i hope you are pleased by this ornament to your quarters
vronsky bows and kisses her fingers
ill be off home if im in the way
youre at home where you are baroness
pierre you never say such pretty things to me
we were just discussing my husband
he wont divorce me you see
and do you know why
because he likes eating off my family silver
i want to bring an action
just because im supposed to be unfaithful i dont see why i have to eat off pierres crockery
look at it
its my crockery
how was moscow
anna her dress changed lies on serozhas bed on her side one arm under his bedclothes scratching his back gently
he lies quietly on his stomach with his eyes closed his face inches from hers
in the dim light of a night light she gazes at him for long moments
she resumes scratching
he grunts contentedly
thank you for my present
she kisses him and continues to lie there gently scratching
he falls quickly asleep
she removes her arm and restores his bedclothes
there is a suite of rooms the bedroom connects to annas boudoir dressing room and thence to karenins small sitting room dressing room which connects to the rest of the
the rooms like the whole house are lit by gas lamps but also by candles at key points
korney the valet gathers up a discarded shirt etc
karenin in a dressing gown is reading in a comfortable chair by a candle lamp
anna is at her bureau
she frowns and tears up the letter she is writing
karenin looks at the clock nearly midnight and closes his book
he blows out the candle
he comes to the boudoir announcing himself with a smile
time for bed
karenin comes to put his hand on annas shoulder
im writing to dolly
and to kitty
anna shakes her head and clasps his hand
candles each side of the bed
karenin cracks his knuckles
he unlocks a drawer and opens a tin box lying in the drawer
anna disrobing registers these sounds
what are they saying in moscow about the new statute
what new statute
karenin takes a contraceptive sheath made from animal intestine re usable from the tin
the new statute i carried in council
anna blows her candle out and gets into bed
no one mentioned it
he comes to bed in his nightshirt
here it made quite a sensation
he gets into bed
anna waits dead eyed
karenin blows his candle out
kitty a hollow eyed version of herself in a demure nightdress sits upright on a chaise longue with her legs stretched out
the family doctor deferen tially removes one of her slippers as though it were an intimate garment
forgive me princess but i must
with a silver fork the doctor tests the sole of her foot for a reflex
kitty is miserably going along with a farce she despises
the prince and princess are hovering
the princess flutters with anxiety the prince is in a temper
am i the only one who knows whats wrong with her
but a celebrity doctor as shiny as his own gold watch which he is check ing is bearing down on them riding over a footmans attempt to announce him
oh thank god doctor my friends say youre the only one who can save her
possibly princess possibly
at your service your excellencies
where is the patient
kitty is sobbing with shame the celebrity doctor has stripped her to the waist and is tapping her chest
the family doctor cant bear it and excuses himself
come come princess we are not backward people i handle naked bodies every day
deep breath now
the family doctor and the parents are in a huddle
the prince is apoplectic
ill challenge the scoundrel
its the modern way
to the prince youre not a doctor
loss of appetite fast well whose pulse wouldnt be fast if some brute of a the celebrity doctor comes briskly out of kittys room checking his watch
we must treat the nerves
a tubercular cavity is suspected too soon to tell
soden water every two hours
i must see her again tomorrow
the prince enters kittys room
kitty is humiliated and triple wrapped against the violation of her bosom
dont you fret my little kate
youll wake up one fine morning and say to yourself i feel well and happy and ill go out for a walk with papa
the prince is mortified when kittys sobs redouble
the social set anna now moves in is the brilliant circle with connections to the court on one hand and to the demi monde of artists on the other
a leading light of this set is princess betsy tverskaya a rich society beauty
betsys immediate circle includes tuskevich her admirer
anna lifts her eyes to see vronsky in front of her talking to betsy
vronsky sees anna and bows
she acknowledges him and kisses betsy and moves on studying the next picture
vronsky watches anna move on
betsy cocks an eye at him
a few rows of chairs in someones reception room a mixed audience of guests a flashy pianist
betsy with a toy dog on her lap tuskevich on one side anna on the other
the dog yaps and sneezes
betsy hands the dog to tuskevich who goes to exit with the dog
as tuskevich leaves vronsky comes in
anna sees him
she turns back to the piano
betsy glances at her
anna and betsy on a bright snow white day are being driven through a park in betsys smart equipage
towards a horseman walking towards them vronsky salutes the little carriage as it trots by him
anna keeps looking straight ahead
betsy acknowledges vronskys salute
i want to give a small dinner before the opera
is there anyone you would like me to ask
yes the metropolitan bishop of st
annushka puts annas opera cloak over her shoulders while korney stands ready with karenins cloak and opera hat
karenin comes down the stairs to join anna
kapitonich stands ready to let them out
countess lydia tells me you havent been to one of her evenings since you returned
the last one was to meet a missionary the one before was for a lecture on the union of the greek and roman churches
im sorry i know youre fond of her
come on or well be late
kapitonich opens the door to let them out
this is a small theatre with a promenade area where a group of guards officers of high and low rank mix together to enjoy the chanteuses the comedians and the
can can girls
vronsky is with his commanding officer colonel demin
heres the thing vronsky
a posting has come up and theres a promotion in it for you
thank you sir
the garrison in tashkent
i would like to stay in peter sir if you dont mind
i dont mind
but your mother
the can can music starts up to many cheers
demin claps enthusiastically
vronsky is angry
an attendant takes vronskys coat and gives him a token for it
there is a performance going on within resolving into applause as he mounts the stairs
karenin an escapee looking at his pocket watch comes down the stairs goes down past vronsky looks back at him for a moment and continues
vronsky enters the box as the performance prepares to resume
it is the tverskoy box occupied by princess betsy and her husband who is likeable overweight and strangely enough looking at an antiquarian book wear ing white gloves
vronsky bows to them and sits down next to betsy
he takes her opera glasses and looks through them at the karenin box
you didnt come to my dinner
i had to see my commanding officer
she didnt come either
vronsky watches anna through the glasses
countess lydia ivanovna is next to her
lydia is in her forties sallow no beauty sincerely religious and determined
work never ceases for great men
your husband is a saint and we must all cherish him for russias sake
anna winces a smile
i hope you can come on afterwards father kristofs report on the chinese mission will be with lantern slides
im expected at the tverskoys
no doubt but im sure princess betsy can wait for you my dear
anna glances at betsys box and sees vronsky there
the opera resumes
in fact i think i wont go to betsys
vronsky looks through betsys glasses
im afraid i am becoming ridiculous
discreet footmen move chairs to accommodate the guests who move to join one of the conversation circles that make a buzz in the room
betsy sits by the samovar with her little court including tuskevich
the guests include the princess myagkaya stout red faced outspoken and two society ladies lisa merkalova and annas friend
now theres a phenomenon look annas shadow has arrived before anna
im annas friend
but this making up ones mind to it in public is not polite to a distinguished man like karenin
in my opinion karenin is a fool and anna is the best of us
and we all love you for your contrary opin ions princess
vronsky looks around
he knows everybody in the room
you look desperate
thats not attractive
im losing hope
hope of what
persuading a virtuous woman to break her marriage vows
and how is tuskevich
thats not attractive either
besides i was never virtuous
no youre right
she wont come
im going home
the karenin coach arrives
its anna arriving at betsys
she enters the house in almost unseemly haste
several coaches are waiting
vronsky in a state lets himself be carried along
then he changes his mind
he puts his head out of the window to shout to the coachman
faces turn to her
she glances around
she knows at once that vronsky isnt there
betsy beckons to her across the room
anna self possessed smiling nodding to friends pressing a hand held out to her offering the other hand to be kissed glides through a crowd of betsys guests
wasnt nilsson glorious
one sees that she has studied kaulbach of course
theres something louis quinze about tuskevich
as if he came with the furniture
betsy is smoking elegantly
she kisses anna
but youre just in time for the surprise
there is a series of minor explosions outside and the darkness out there turns into an illuminated garden lit by fountains of fire sprays of light
the guests react with cries of pleasure and applause
anna turns at once to the window near her puts her face up against the glass putting her hands to her temples as if to see the illuminations better
her self possessed face lit by fireworks falls apart in misery
the firework display continues for a short minute and is applauded
betsy acknowledges the congratulations and sycophancy which are her due
foot men come through the room with trays of ices
anna is still at the window unaware that there is only darkness outside
in the room betsy notes the oddity anna alone with her back to the room
anna opens her eyes
she is lost for a moment perplexed
may i have the honour of bringing you an ice
anna turns understanding nothing
ices are being served
i would prefer to try a cigarette
she sits down
vronsky takes out a cigarette case
he lights her cigarette
she tries it and coughs
puffs delicately once
she gives the cigarette to him
ill try another one sometime
she looks at him in surprise
he dunks the cigarette in an abandoned dish of ice cream
just as i was thinking your manners have improved since moscow
you behaved badly very badly
and who was responsible for that
anna gets up and walks over to betsys chair
give me a cup of tea
betsy obediently gets up to fill a cup from the samovar
vronsky follows anna
this is watched by more than one guest
betsy hands the cup to anna
how nice alexei aleksandrevich has arrived
karenin enters smiling
lisa merkalova and annas friend share a delicious malicious moment
im not sure my nerves can stand another alexei at this moment
as betsy and karenin move smilingly to greet each other karenins radar picks up the two womens intimate laughter
karenin remains at apparent ease as though unaware of peoples glances at vronsky and anna and he kisses betsys hand
princess myagkaya has meanwhile gone over to anna
anna likes her and is glad of the diversion
so the schuzburgs asked us to dinner
the sauce was said to have cost a thousand rou bles and it was ghastly
we had to ask them back
i gave them a sauce that cost eighty five kopeks and it was a triumph
anna and vronsky laugh
princess myagkaya moves on
were you glad to see me or not
this must stop
you make me feel as if i were guilty of something
what do you want me to do
i want you to go to moscow and beg kitty to forgive you
no thats not what you want
i can do better than that
tonight i refused a posting to tashkent
i can change my mind and youll never see me again
if you have any thought for me you will give me back my peace
i have no peace to give
there can be no peace for us only misery or the greatest happiness
you are my whole life now
she looks at him and nods slowly as if in thought
betsy diplomatically leads karenin to anna
your husband is impossible
his opinions are all wrong but he talks so brilliantly he wins every argument
anna looks up at her hearing nothing
she notices karenin who kisses her hand
vronsky acknowledges karenin
i called to take you home
no im staying
send the carriage back for me
he bows to betsy
ignoring vronsky he turns away
vronsky is with one group of guests anna with another
she is animated excited at a small table involved in a game of cards which she wins to local applause
she speaks a must go to betsy and swiftly goes to the door
dressed for outdoors anna comes down the staircase
the doorkeeper sees her opens the door and signals
the karenin coach moves to the entrance door which is held open by the doorkeeper
anna hears hurried footsteps on the stairs
she continues towards the door
vronsky catches up with her
the doorkeeper holds the door open
do you want me to go to tashkent
the two horses are restless in the freezing air
konrad looks to the open door
so ill go to tashkent
i dont want you to go
she turns and goes out
vronsky follows her
vronsky opens the carriage door for her
she gets into the coach he closes the door
he watches the coach go
kapitonich lets anna in
karenin reading by candlelight in his dressing gown hears the sounds of annas return all the way to her entrance
he cracks his knuckles
how unlike you
yes i stayed up to talk to you
anna keeps going to her dressing room boudoir
he waits for her to return without her cloak
i sent her off
well if you want to talk but we should go to bed
i have to warn you about something
its really rather late
i wish to warn you that you may inadver tently by indiscretion and carelessness give the world occasion to talk about you
i am not a committee
please say what you want to tell me
you and count vronsky attracted attention tonight
you dont like it when i dont talk to people and you dont like it when i do
i didnt notice anything myself
but i saw that everyone else noticed
i consider jeal ousy to be insulting to you and degrading to me
i have no right to inquire into your feelings
they concern only your conscience
but im your husband and i love you
its my duty to remind you that we are bound together by god and this bond can only be broken by a crime against god
i have nothing to say to you and im tired
and you have a son
she returns to the boudoir
after a moment he follows
karenin finds her in her underwear throwing aside her dress
he apolo gises for that
if i am wrong i ask your pardon
i dont know what youre talking about and its really too late for this
excuse me please
because she wants to undress karenin leaves her
anna lies in bed next to karenin elated
in the next instant seemingly in her own bed she gasps and jerks as though her body has taken a blow
the cuts are now between a fragmented narrative of voracious sex sex as before and prelude to sex this being a sequence of shots starting with anna arrives heavily veiled
she enters the building
vronsky opens his door to anna
they dont speak
he takes her hand and brings her in
vronsky leads anna through the apartment to the bedroom
vronsky takes off annas outer clothes slowly and carefully starting with her hat and veil
anna in underclothes unbuttons vronskys shirt
anna and vronsky are standing kissing passionately
he has no shirt
anna ends up half off the edge of vronskys bed climaxing upside down and falling to the floor
vronsky also half off the bed looks down at her
he reaches down for her
she grasps hold of his hand huddled hugs it to her distressed to tears
oh god forgive me
its the end of everything ive got nothing left now only you
how can i not remem ber
youre my happiness
he draws her back on to the bed kisses her face her shoulder
you murdered my happiness
she tries to leave but he attacks her as a lover and she gives way responding
she starts hitting him
in sunshine a large chunk of ice loses its purchase on winter and goes floating along a stream of tiny ice floes between grassy banks almost free of snow with
early aconites showing
the icy stream flows under a footbridge which has a broken handrail
vasili the steward is on the bridge with a carpenter
levin on horseback is displeased
i thought that had been done
i gave the order
what can you do with these people
levin rides on into an expanded prospect of fields and woods snow on the ground
when levin gets in view of the house he is puzzled by the distant sight of a three horse sledge arriving
the new arrival is oblonsky enjoying his food
ah potage aux choux a la russe
agafia comes in with the roast fowl
if you opened up in moscow langleterre would go out of business
do you want news of moscow
youre right what do you care
you love the country youve got it
you love agricultur ing and lord knows youve got it
you love shooting youve got it
youve got every thing you want
agafia leaving throws levin a look no wife
all right go on then
have you stopped stealing bread rolls
ballet girl oriental type
how can i help it
so nothing new to tell me
how is how are the shcherbatskys
you mean kitty
is she engaged now
vronsky went back to st
he waits for this to sink in
kitty will be at ergoshovo visiting dolly in the summer
oh yes as if i had time in the summer
and ive got extra land this year at kashin for the haymaking
thats on the ergoshovo road isnt it
wont you call when kitty is there
especially not then
i humiliated myself once
now its a row
damn you kostya you love kitty and you cant forgive her because first you funked it then you bungled it then you ran away from an eighteen year old girl
who was made a fool of by a uniform
its kitty im sorry for not you
her heart told her no
did you come to shoot snipe or criticize me
levin and oblonsky with laska wait with their guns a few yards apart
levin has calmed down
for you getting married is
a social engage ment
not for me
for me its the condition of personal happiness and living the right way
ill never again be carried away by passion
i renounce it
ill have to find another way
look out here they come
a couple of snipe come drumming over the trees
the men fire simultane ously
one snipe falls
despite himself levin laughs too
laska retrieves the bird
dolly has had her baby
she is holding the infant having just finished feeding him
kitty is with her
oh im sore with his feeding
would you like to hold him
dolly gives the baby to kitty who takes him almost unwillingly
dolly buttons herself
kittys maternal instinct wont engage
dolly notes it
well dont hold him like a parcel
its aunt kitty darling
look at you
doesnt he make you ashamed of dwelling on your troubles
i have no troubles
that man wasnt worth the tears believe me
i dont care about him
i dont even think about him
except to hate her
then well never speak of it again
dolly relieves kitty of the baby
there are better men waiting for you
kitty my lamb did konstantin levin
what has levin got to do with it
anyway ill never get married
the whole business of
its become disgusting to me
and look what its done for you
why do they call it love
because its love
lovingly she settles the baby in his crib her face filled with tender joy at the bargain
a lovers idyll by a stream on a warm day
anna lightly dressed smoking a cigarette watches vronsky fill his wineglass from a tethered bottle in the stream
there is a pony trap which brought them
he comes back to sit by her
she kisses him
i want you to
i dont care about it
you should care
youre not supposed to
she laughs and throws her cigarette into the stream
you a soldier
would you faint
anyway someone might be watching
anna looks all around
she lifts a dock leaf to look under it
she looks up at the sky
but im damned anyway
anna pushes him onto his back and straddles him
you love me
apart from frou frou
anna holds his face between her hands and works her body on him
but me more than your horse
are you happy
and you love me
anna drags the front of her skirts out of her way
and this much
and this much
she falls on him
he strokes her hair
her hand comes into view the index finger bloody
she carefully paints his lips with it
she kisses his lips clean and rolls off him onto her back
so this is love
korney brings countess lydia
karenin comes from behind his desk to invite her to a chair
i thought you would be at peterhof now
ive come from there
im distressed that you havent taken your usual house this year
anna wanted a change
she is spending the summer at tsarskoe
near princess betsy
the guards are in summer camp at tsarskoe
alexei alexandrovich forgive me but you are too tolerant
karenin affects surprise
oh is this about my wife
he smiles at her
my wife is beyond reproach
she is after all my wife
countess lydia gets the message
she rises to go
karenin kisses her hand and accompanies her to the door
she leaves him and his social mask gives way to his disturbance
the commanding officer is throwing a party for his officers serious drink ing soldier servants a crowded table on the large verandah soldier sing ers in white linen tunics performing
operetta and folk songs
vronsky in party spirit is with petritsky and another friend yashvin singing along
an officer we dont know is surprisingly hailed as vronsky
hes vronskys elder brother alexander
he gestures later
and goes to vron sky
the brothers embrace
a message from maman
her friend princess sorokina has a house here and a virgin daughter thats not part of the message but theyll all be at the races and youre expected to supper
the song ends and demin half drunk climbs on the table shouts for silence and a toast
gentlemen i give you the regiment
on a garden bench where the noise of the party is quieter vronsky and alexander talk
i heard you turned down a promotion
that was maman interfering
and now shes come up with a princess for you
alexei were brothers so dont take offence
getting married puts the pack on your back it leaves your hands free for climbing the ladder
getting serious about a married woman is like carrying your pack in your arms
so they talk about me
im leaving sasha
come on ill introduce you
vronsky with alexander beside him clucks his tongue at the black opening of a stable and calls softly for frou frou
theres a stir within and the mares head appears
vronsky opens the door
a man would come to no harm
do you think youll win tomorrow
makhotins gladiator is favourite sixteen hands frou frou looks dainty beside him but shes got heart
havent you my darling
he kisses frou frou
vronsky sees anna before she sees him
he pauses to look at her struck by her beauty full of love for her
she is lost in thought
she has not been expecting him
she is concerned
alexei what is it
he shakes his head nothing
she comes to him and hides her face in his breast
he holds her tight taking her hand and kissing it
i couldnt bear not to see you before the race
she hugs him kissing his tunic
what were you thinking about
she continues to hide her face
he lifts her face
vronsky presses her hand to his face
he kisses her brow and her eyes
well love was never a game to us
heres an end to living in corners existing day to day on lies
yes now we can be together
how can we alexei
tell karenin everything
do you think my husband will make you a present of me
leave him and be your mistress
i would never see my son again
the laws are made by husbands and fathers
ill never forgive myself for your unhappiness
anna looks into his face
im like a starving beggar who has been given food
she smiles rapturously
no this is my happiness
she kisses him deeply
its a good maze
anna and serozha are running laughing between the hedges
its a game
she is trying to find her way to him chasing him
a hedge divides them
serozha darts away from her runs into a dead end doubles back
she spots him follows him and now he has eluded her again
serozha finds his way out of the maze and is confronted by karenin
how are you young man
your tutor doesnt seem to be in evidence
well have a look at your lesson books
anna coming out of the maze sees karenin recovers
you got away at last
can you stay
serozha looks scared to tears
anna kisses him
go and find vasily lukich
serozha runs into the house
i have to change
princess betsy is sending her trap for me
would you like to come
shes taking me to watch the race
karenin smiles coldly
no ill come on later and then i must get back to town
anna returns to the house
she wipes her kissed hand on her skirt
this is a rough and ready racecourse but the venue for a high society occa sion with a grandstand for top people and a grander section ornamented for greater comfort
for members of the imperial family
it is also a fashion parade for some
the racecourse itself is an oval approached by a straight
there are nine fences water jumps etc
of various difficulty
the jockeys are officers in the guards the hussars and other regiments
among them is vronsky attended by a trainer who is fussing over frou frous bridle and calming her
vronsky looks with interest at a big power ful horse which must be gladiator with captain makhotin already in the saddle
makhotin and vronsky greet each other with a nod
arrives at the races
making his way towards the front smiling raising his hat to acquaintances
his eyes busy looking for his wife
he reaches the front and looks up at the ladies stand
anna and betsy are here and not far away so are countess vronsky and the princesses sorokina the mother is a fading fortyish the daughter is eighteen blonde and pretty
below the ladies section is a planked standing area for gentlemen who also may stand to watch the races from the stepped aisle of the seated section
soldiers horse people and locals watch from the turf
a race is flowing towards the winning post with accompanying crowd reac tion but it is clear from annas detachment exchanging chat with betsy that this is not vronskys race
looks up to the ladies stand
betsy smiles at him in greeting but anna seems unaware
countess vronsky appraises the young princess
you really ought to be the spoil of victory today
the young princess smiles at her
countess vronsky turns her glasses towards the starting post
vronsky mounts frou frou
the riders move to the starting line
watches anna who is looking through her glasses towards the starting post while the current race finishes to cheers
annas anxious attention turns to a horse and rider who fell further down the course and to the ambulance wagon with a red cross sewn on it
karenin mounts the steps of the aisle raising his hat to ladies he knows
anna ignores him
on the wooden boards below where gentlemen are watching oblonsky calls up to betsy
what do you fancy in the next
im on vronsky
a pair of gloves
in the aisle at the top of the stand karenin watches as vronskys brother alexander escorting his wife varya bows to anna and betsy but significantly varya succeeds in not
the riders line up
and theyre off
the stands and spectators are distant the first fence coming at him horses on either side
his neighbour falls at the fence but frou frou is clear with gladiator half a length in front
the next fence is coming up
gladiator and frou frou jump cleanly but a following horse falls badly
spectators on either side of anna and those behind and in front collectively react
anna reacts not at all
her gaze through her glasses stays unwavering on vronsky
karenin notes this and from then on his attention is fixed on anna
when the horses come opposite the stand she lowers her glasses and follows frou frou taking the lead from gladiator
eases frou frou past gladiator
the horses take the next jump
with one hand anna grips her folded fan
karenins face is a mask as he watches anna unconsciously half destroying it
she raises her glasses
frou frou approaches the last fence with gladiator half a length behind on the near side to anna
working the reins rising and falling in rhythm with the horse looks ahead to the winning post and before knowing it he makes an error losing the rhythm dropping back
into the saddle and raising the horses head just as frou frou takes off
frou frou rises gladiator rises
frou frou disappears
gladiator clears the fence in annas foreground
simultaneously there are shrieks and exclamations all around her off camera and the view through the glasses zigzags in search of frou frou impeded by horses jumping the fence
she lowers the glasses and sees frou frou on the ground rolling over and vronsky on the ground
sees this too her mouth set tight with contempt
almost in the same moment he hears annas anguished cry conspicuous in the hubbub that follows the crowds exclamation
this is adroit
he comes down several steps and pushes through to offer his arm but anna has lost control trying to escape like a bird beating against its cage
would you like to leave
anna ignores him puts her glasses to her eyes searching out vronsky
vronsky extricates himself from his broken horse and in terrible recrimina tion tries to pull frou frou to her feet by the reins
frou frou struggles to get up but her back is broken
officials officers and a doctor have come running
sees an officer hurrying to the imperial party to report
what are they saying
vronskys unhurt but the horse
anna relapses into sobs attempting to hide her face behind her destroyed fan
betsy gives anna her fan
is restrained by an officer
her backs broken
the officer takes a pistol from his holster
vronsky enraged and in grief takes the pistol from him
persists with anna
im asking you
if you wish to go
he touches annas arm
she jerks it away
no leave me alone
ill bring her home alexei
excuse me princess but anna is not well and i want her to come with me
a gunshot is heard from the course
anna turns her tear streaked face towards it
annas hysteria has solidified into a blank despair
karenin seems to want to pretend that nothing important has happened
they say the emperor dis approves of the races
the danger of injury
anna looks at him contemptuously
im saying there is a value in manly sport for the military i dont understand
in my opinion its not the sport itself thats wrong its the spectacle its making a cruel spectacle out of what are you talking about
karenin changes tack
i have to tell you yes
i have to tell you you behaved improperly today
and how was that
she has raised her voice
he raises a warning finger and reaches to close the communication window behind the coachmans box
by making plain your feelings when one of the riders fell
your conduct was improper
it must not occur again
i have said it before
anna smiles faintly
he is misled by that
you are going to say my concern is unneces sary and ridiculous
you are my wife
i am wrong to think that
yes perhaps i was mistaken
anna looks at him despairingly
no you were not mistaken
i love him
i am his mistress
i cant bear you im afraid of you i hate you
do what you like to me
karenin is literally winded gasping for breath slowly getting his breath ing under control
anna huddles away from him in her corner
karenin recovers himself only to the point of sitting stock still looking at nothing not moving
the coach lurches unbalancing him so that he is pushed against anna
he recoils as if from a contamination
the coach slows
the coach stops
a servant comes to the coach door opens the door
the servant backs off
i will not have a scandal
you will not see
this man again
you will behave in such a way that nothing is known against you by society or by the servants
in return you will keep the privileges of a wife and the duties
tomorrow you will return home
that is all
anna gets out of the coach and runs into the maze
anna comes to vronsky
she is still shaken by the showdown with karenin in his coach but is now overtaken by concern for vronsky after his fall
are you hurt
vronsky shakes his head
he is moved by the sight of her full of love and desire but in her embrace he detects something new a nervous exaltation
i told him im your mistress
vronsky lifts her face strokes her cheek
he thinks i can give you up and go on living
he embraces her for that relieved grateful loving understanding that she is not going to give him up
no you cannot
imperial hands the tsars for all we know place over karenins head a broad red ribbon from which hangs a heavy medal
karenin bows low
at an ornate doorway a major domo announces
their excellencies minister karenin and madame karenin
karenin wearing his medal and anna smile their way into a party to a patter of polite applause
further grandees are being announced but are not applauded
prince and princess berghatskoy
ambassador chamber lain
baron and baroness verdlov
prince and princess tverskoy
youre the only man my husband would do this for
to prince tverskoy tell me your latest find for your library
not in front of the princess
betsy draws anna away for a moment
i can tell youre happy
youve put on a little weight
anna in the same dress kisses serozha tenderly so as not to wake him and leaves the room
anna enters the suite where karenin in his dressing gown puts down his book
he is elated by his evening
time for bed
anna is in bed
karenin is getting ready for bed
anna listens apprehen sively to the little noises of karenins pre coital preparations
not that i care for decorations but
but im his wife now
she turns to him i am having his child
karenin stares at her
he turns back to the open drawer and puts things back the way they were
he locks the drawer
he puts on his dressing gown and leaves the room
anna waits a moment and follows him
anna hears the crack of his knuckles and can see him faintly sitting in the dark
tell me what i did to deserve this
a prospect next to a country road a large expanse of meadow is being mown forty swathes at a time by forty mowers swinging their scythes almost in unison
closer levin is suffering but keeping up bathed in perspiration
his place is behind an old man theodore who is scything as if without effort
just in time for levin theodore calls a halt and takes levins scythe to sharpen it with a whetstone
levin attracts a few grins and comments
konstantin dmitrich youll know your rows when the fields all done
levins row has stalks of differing heights between the even swathes on either side
there is some laughter but the men are uneasy
its time to stop for the day
the mowers with their scythes walk back across the large meadow of cut swathes
from the other direc tion a crowd of village women are coming to meet them carrying food and drink
a fire has been lit
the mowers eat their meal in the company of women
serafina tends to a cooking pot in the firelight
levin watches her discreetly
he has settled down at a discreet distance from the men
his attention is caught by a grown up boy and his young wife who have chosen to sit slightly apart
he is charmed by them watching the girl serve her husband
theodore comes to levin with a jug
levin takes a swig
how many mowers is it theodore
forty two master
in your fathers time it was work for two days for thirty men
though he never picked up a scythe himself
the men dont like me for it
they like what theyre used to
it settles me
how is that master
when im mowing i dont ask myself why im here
youre here to be master konstantin dmi trich to be your fathers son and father to a son who will be master after you as it has always been by
the grace of god
my father owned you theodore
my grand father owned your father
owned you like chattels to be bought and sold
was that by the grace of god
those were good times when your father had the keeping of us
thats my youngest you were looking at there
his young life is perilous now since the free dom came and work must be found
its true i was looking at him
at his wife too i dare say
levin is abashed found out
they look happier than ive ever been
is it living simply that im looking for
night under the stars
some of the men have gone some have settled in for the night
the cooking fire is burning out
levin remains where he was watching thinking drawn to the simple life
woken by hoofbeats and the jingle of harness
levin sees a coach coming towards him
the coach comes nearer leather boxes strapped to the roof
levin sees that a young woman is looking out of the side window holding on to the white ribbons of her bonnet
he sees that it is kitty on her way to ergoshovo
princess shcherbatsky is also inside dozing
the coach passes on leaving levin lovelorn the dawn light on him
the sight of kitty has turned him round again
vronsky stands at the entrance to the platform holding a bouquet waiting for a train
he looks pretty fed up
as before the set up is a small stage a small auditorium and an area for drinking cruising etc
a combination of music hall and a bar with a few tables
vronsky is here as the escort of a foreign prince an indian watch ing a risque show with can can girls much relished by the visitor
vronskys glance casts about in the gloom
the champagne is flowing
vron sky spots a trio lisa merkalova betsy and stremov a politician and karenins rival
vronsky catches betsys eye
she beckons him
he excuses himself to the foreign prince who doesnt notice and goes over to the other table
under the music he is introduced to stremov and kisses the hands of the women
he takes the empty chair
hes some kind of prince at home
where is tuskevitch this evening
why ask me
at which moment makhotin appears at the table
vronsky relinquishes his chair
vronsky bows to the women
i must leave you
im on duty tonight
give her my respects and to karenin if you see him
vronsky freezes in anger
would you compromise me
lisa and stremov are enjoying it
vronsky turns away
the foreign prince is applauding enthusiastically when vronsky rejoins him
i only say that a man who cant govern his wife has perhaps gone as far as he can go in government
he has fallen asleep in his clothes
a note has been deliv ered propped up by the bed
he reaches for it
a cab brings vronsky
the karenin coach is waiting outside
as vronsky approaches the door it opens and kapitonich comes out with a folded rug
kapitonich is wrong footed by seeing him
karenin comes out of the door into the gaslight
when he sees vronsky he hesitates for a fraction but con tinues
kapitonich is holding open the door of the coach
vronsky bows karenin expressionless touches his hat and gets into the coach taking the rug
vronsky walks into the house as the coach moves off
kapitonich comes in closing the door
vronsky gives him his hat and coat
good evening your excellency
kapitonich is uneasy
a footman comes from a service door
he sees vron sky and looks to kapitonich
i am expected
kapitonich nods to the footman
anna six months pregnant is seated almost formally
the footman lets vronsky in and retires closing the door
anna runs to vronsky
i will not live like this
he holds her calming her hushing her
he leads her into a winter garden conservatory off the reception room
waiting hour after hour while youre drink ing champagne with naked actresses dont think i dont know
lisa merkalova still calls on me
its punishment enough that im on escort duty without
yes im sorry its my demon i cant help it
you wrote that you were ill
well i am
but dont worry
it wont be for long ill soon be out of your way soon
no its true
i was told it in a dream
there it was only a bad dream
yes and im only going to die having your baby
thats all nonsense
she kisses him all over his face
tell me it is tell me it is
you love me
your note said your husband would be out
he was late
serves him right
why do you call him my husband
he isnt my husband hes a clock a wooden doll but it was awkward
a matter of your honour
you made an agreement
anna flares up again
do you think of my honour when youre sharing whores with your hindoo
your demon again
ill be glad to die before you start to hate me
anna gives a gasp
put your hand there
did you feel him move
the committee is in session
stremov has the floor
he is referring to a map of russia on an easel splotched with colours
karenin is there but not listening his thoughts far away
i must respectfully ask minister karenin whether his proposals for the regulation of these colourful gypsy tribes of these schol arly god fearing jews and of but im afraid i
have lost the ministers attention
all turn to look at karenin who sits staring at nothing unaware even of the pause
for a beat he hardly knows where he is
kapitonich lets karenin in
karenin is brisk
who is here
only madame your excellency
karenin goes up the staircase
there is an urgency in him a fury
karenin walks in and goes to her bureau empties out little drawers and receptacles looking for the key to the main drawer
anna comes in from the bedroom alarmed in her nightdress
i wanted to see him because
i do not wish to be told why a woman wants to see her lover
he pulls furiously at the locked drawer then looks around for an implement
what are you
i want his letters
karenin finds an iron bootjack
anna tries to stop him
he pushes her aside and smashes the wood around the lock then struggling against her he takes from the open drawer a pretty cardboard box a good guess
he confirms that it contains letters
i am going to moscow tomorrow and then to the provinces with a commission to investigate conditions among the jews and gypsies whose conditions i infinitely prefer to my own
i will not return to this house until divorce has put you into the street
meanwhile my son will be sent to live with my eldest sister
leave me serozha
karenin looks at her with contempt
do you think i would let you have my son
you are depraved a woman without honour
i thank god the curse of love is lifted from me
he walks out with the box of letters
oblonsky arrives outside his office building in a cab
saluted by the hall porter oblonsky mounts a semi grand staircase and arrives at the entrance to his department
he goes in
levin stands up in his almost new hardly used coat top hat and boots
levin smiles hopefully sheepish
i need your advice
its a reprise
he seizes levin and kisses him
a small group
dolly is playing the piano
kitty turns the pages for dolly
the old prince shcherbatsky and the princess are with countess nordston and oblonsky
well is he coming
kitty keeping half an eye on the door sees levin enter and misses the page turn
oblonsky goes to greet levin
am i late
who is here
of course youre late
come and meet
drily amused we nearly met at the shcherbatskys last winter
levin puzzled bows to her and to the prince and princess who are respec tively pleased and making the best of it and then to dolly who approaches
come into the fold
kitty is here
levin is shaken
dolly leads him to kitty who is frightened shy and shamefaced
dolly leaves them
what a long time since we saw each other
since you saw me but i saw you not so long ago
you were driving to ergoshovo
i was at kashin for the haymaking
oh but why didnt you
they are both embarrassed by the wrong step
im so glad to see you
youre just the same
i hope not i was young and silly in those days
months and months ago
and you havent changed
kitty looks up at him decoding
they gauge each other shyly
permit me to announce soup marie lou ise carp with asparagus and roast beef
i went to the market in person
but matvey at that moment presents oblonsky with a visiting card on a salver
oblonsky reads it
an extra place
the new arrival is karenin
oblonsky is pleased
im glad you came
ive been on tour in the regions a govern ment commission
im sorry i have come to tell you our connection must be severed
im going to divorce your sister
dear me what are you talking about
dont be in a hurry
stay to dinner and later talk it over with dolly prince oblonsky everything is over between our families
divorce is one thing but dinner is quite another
dinner for eight clockwise oblonsky countess nordston prince shcher batsky kitty karenin dolly levin and princess shcherbatsky
two servants and matvey serve at the table clearing away the carp with asparagus
the princess is challenging karenin
you petersburgers think yourselves so de bon ton compared with dull old fashioned moscow but we know how to do things only the other day i hear vasya pryachnikov fought
a duel with kvitsky and killed him
oblonskky attempts to divert the conversation
well whats this government commission karenin
but karenin ignores him
oblonsky looks on helplessly
what was the challenge about
pryachnikovs wife naturally
it was a matter of honour defending a womans honour
karenin remains cool
it sounds like barbarism to me
and what if the lover had killed the husband
would that have preserved the wifes honour too
still not many of us can say that our lover died for love
thou shall not covet thy neighbours wife
would you die for love konstantin dmitrich
but not for my neighbours wife
levin is nettled to find that he seems to have made a joke for the countess especially
kitty remains serious watching levin loving him
an impure love is not love to me
to admire another mans wife is a pleasant thing but sensual desire indulged for its own sake is greed a kind of gluttony and a misuse of something sacred which
is given to us so that we may choose the one person with whom to fulfill our humanness
otherwise we might as well be cattle
ah an idealist
reconciliatory laughter eases the atmosphere
levin feels abashed at coming out of his shell
he steals a glance at kitty and finds her looking at him
she smiles at him and drops her eyes
the dinner party settles in
dolly and karenin sit knee to knee in a corner
but she will be nobodys wife shell be ruined
i tried to save her
she chose ruin
alexei aleksandrevich look at me
you will have no peace of mind until you forgive her
it was anna who taught me that
i do not wish to forgive
i am not a cruel man
i have never hated anyone
but i hate her with all my soul for all the wrong she has done me
levin and kitty are at the card table with a spillage of the alphabet pieces
its your turn to play us something countess
since we last met there is something i have often wanted to ask you
what is that
levin sorts through the alphabet pieces as though he is putting off the moment but he quickly puts four letters spaced out in a row d n m n
levin adds an i next to the d
levin shakes his head
he adds an e next to the second n
the last word is never
kitty puts letters in place
they read did no mean levin looks into her eyes
kitty finds letters and presents levin with t i d n k
levin adds now to the k
levin adds ot to the n
levin adds an o to the d
kitty shakes her head
she puts an h after the t
i know what it says
dolly looking across the room sees kitty and levin serious and smiling rapt
levin places extra letters then i did not know
kitty finds c y f a f
can you forgive
levin puts down i l y
i never stopped
he looks up to see silent tears streaming down her face
his own eyes flood
karenin walks away from the oblonsky house
he lifts his face to meet the snowflakes
he looks tortured
snow melts on his face like tears
he takes from his wallet a telegram
he stands in the snow uncertain
karenin sits like a statue
karenin is let into the house by kapitonich
how is your mistress
safely delivered of a daughter your excellency
she is well
the mistress is very poorly
karenin going to the stairs sees vronskys cloak and cap on the coat stand
karenin comes up the staircase
when he reaches his dressing room he hears anna shouting for alexei in her delirium
anna shouts the name again
karenin enters annas boudoir
karenin sees vronsky sitting with his hands over his face
vronsky jumps up in confusion
please let me stay
karenin looks at him coldly and enters the bedroom
anna is not seeing or hearing struggling against the doctor and the mid wife while annushka holds her hand
she talks only of you
in her delirium anna keeps up a bright prattle
why doesnt he come
he is kind
he will forgive me
hes here look look cant you see him
i want alexei
why doesnt he come
give me some water
no i mustnt its not good for my little girl
or let her have a nurse
yes dont bring her here because alexei is coming and it will hurt him to see her
hes come my dear look there
annushka gives way to karenin who kneels by the bed taking annas hand
annushka hurries out
oh what nonsense
i must be asleep thats what it is
you think he wont forgive me but you dont know him
no one knows him except me
im not afraid of him now
karenin gazes at her
he looks at her as hes never looked at her
im afraid of death though
karenin tries to speak but cannot
he starts making shushing noises as to a baby
she quietens down
she seems to recognise him
oh my dear
dont look at me like that
i am not the one you think
im afraid of her
she fell in love with another man
im the real one
but im dying now then shell be dead too
let him come in
vronsky hears her calling
he comes into the bedroom
vronsky covers his face unmanned
the doctor nods to the midwife leave them alone
take your hands away from your face
look at my husband
hes a saint
take his hand
alexei take his hands away
karenin pulls vronskys fingers and holds on to vronskys hand
forgive him too
thank god thank god
anna is asleep
karenin is alone with her
the crisis seems to be over
she opens her eyes
so you came
karenin puts his face down to her shoulder
she strokes him
if i had died as i wanted you would be free of your troubles at last
i am free of them
anna closes her eyes and sleeps again
karenin comes in
vronsky is there
he looks up abjectly
whatever you think of me please believe me i love her i could not have done other wise than what i
what i did
karenin nods and sits next to him
but you must leave now
i promise to send for you if she asks for you
i dont know what happened
i forgive you
i forgive anna
my soul is filled with joy
i will remain with her and look after her for ever
karenin stands up and offers his hand
vronsky grasps it and starts shaking
come now come now
karenin embraces him comforting him
vronsky arrives back at his flat
and finds his mother waiting for him in his sitting room
look at you
you look like what you are
i fancy you are to be asked to leave the regiment
i would like you to go maman
i will go when im ready to go
a little affair with a married woman puts a finish ing touch to a young mans education but this morbid selfish obsession
you have publicly humiliated a man who has devoted his life to russia and it will not be forgot ten
youd better come back to moscow with me
youre finished here
he taps his breastbone im finished here
for the first time vronsky is wearing civilian clothes
looking reflect ingly at his uniform hanging in his wardrobe
he places his cavalry cap carefully on a shelf and closes the wardrobe
levin is half dressed in clothes to be married in assisted by matvey and watched over by oblonsky who is in wedding clothes
levin is frantic
oblonsky is perplexed
matvey is unflappable holding levins coat ready and following him around
no ill go to her and tell her its not too late to stop this business
better now than when were married and she realises she doesnt love me
but she does love you
how can she
i mean look at me
suppose shes only marrying me to get married
suppose shes still in love with vronsky
shes making a terrible mistake
ill go to her and tell her shes free thats what i must do
your coat sir
levin snatches the coat and puts it on and dashes out of the room
levin in disarray is let into the house
the entrance hall is crowded loud and chaotic with children maids governesses and kittys mother
tanya masha and lili are bridesmaids
grisha is a page
princess shcherbatsky trying to create order among last minute bouquet distribution hair adjustments shoe changing etc
sees levin and explodes
i have to talk to kitty
youre not allowed to see her
levin gallops up the stairs
kitty dressed for the church is whispering into the crack of the bedroom door
i dont understand at all
whats the matter with you
you cant love me
think it over
let people say what they like
are you mad
have you changed your mind
if you dont love me
but i do love you
levin hesitates desperate
well i love you
they link hands through the opening each with a hand to kiss
a mere fragment of a long and ornate marriage ceremony
the grizzled priest lights two decorated candles holding them askew in his left hand and he uses his right hand to touch levin and more tenderly kitty
he gives the couple the candles kitty taking hers in her gloved hand
levin looks blissfully at kitty
the priest lifts crowns from their heads and invites them to kiss each other relieving them of their candles
the choir bursts with pride
the baby girl two months old is being fed by a wet nurse
replete the baby is given over to the nursemaid who lays the child in her crib
karenin watches all this
the women ignore him they are used to him now and karenin is harmless
karenin stares fascinated at the baby who stares back
anna stares at herself in the mirror
the act of raising a pair of scissors is an effort
she isolates a thick lock of her hair and snips it off
annas hair is short all over
she sits up in bed listening to princess betsy who has brought the current gossip
and there was her husband wearing her best ballgown rouge all over his face
ma chere le scandale
but id better tell you some regimental news
karenin enters and sees a glamorous footman standing in the entrance hall holding a white fur cape
who is here
princess elisabeth federovna tverskaya your excellency
karenin approaches the bedroom door
no i dont want to see him
but your husband surely wouldnt
anna sees karenin who is about to retreat
please excuse me
i am so glad to see you
everyone asks after you
karenin bows to her and kisses annas hand
you look feverish
we have been talking too much so im going
princess betsy came to tell me
i dont want to hide anything from you
count vronsky asked to come to say goodbye hes going away
i have said i cant receive him
betsy kisses anna
goodbye my treasure
karenin follows betsy out
anna gives in to a moment of grief and recovers herself when she hears the crack of karenins knuckles
he comes in
i agree with you
as he is going away there is no need for count vronsky to come here
i have just said so so theres no need to repeat it
but it is for you to decide
yes and i decided
then i am very glad that that we agree so perhaps we can stop talk ing about it
is there anything i can do for you
yes can you please please please stop crack ing your knuckles
im a bad woman
but i cant breathe
your kindness which i cant repay and your you begged me for my forgiveness
but i didnt die and now i have to live with it
if only you would have gone on hating me
but then what
what do you want
do you know what you want
do you want to see count vronsky
not to say goodbye
i cant hear
not to say goodbye
you would be lost
you would have no position
and worse if we divorce
you would be the guilty party
that means you cannot legally remarry
your union with count vronsky would be illegitimate and so would your daughter who now has the protection of my name
and that is what you want
it would be a sin to help you destroy yourself
you forget something
count vronsky and i love each other
and this love sanctifies a criminal folly
all i know is that i sent him away and its as if id shot myself through the heart
its the crux for anna and she is prepared for it
i would die for him but i wont live like this for him
when he knows about love hell forgive me
karenin can see where this takes him
then i must choose the smaller sin
vronsky robbed me of my cloak and i will give him my coat
i will give you grounds to divorce me and ill accept the scandal the humilia tion and the consequences to my career
you may write to him but i would prefer you not to see him until you have left this house
two coaches each with considerable luggage have a rendezvous one coach on the bridge
anna is holding baby anya
annushka and the nurse are with her
vronsky in civilian clothes is alone looking anxiously out of the window
anna gives the baby to the nurse as the coach halts
anna gets out of her coach and runs the few yards to vronskys coach
he opens the door for her
anna is kissing vronskys face and being kissed weeping smiling
you look like a boy
but so pale
well go south
to the sea air and sunshine
in a big untidy bed vronsky and anna lie asleep naked and satiated
the style of the room and the warmth of the light tell of the journey made confirmed by the view from the window an attractive panorama from an elevation above
in the room there are open unpacked or partly unpacked trunks and cases and abandoned untidily annas and vronskys clothes
slyudin is in attendance on karenin at his desk
and madame odette in person so to speak your excellency with your permission
a respectful cough at the door reveals an obsequious male shopkeeper
kar enin is bewildered
excuse the liberty your excellency
its for a bonnet and some ribbons her excel lency has overlooked
if you wish us to address ourselves to her excellency please be so good as to tell us where we might
karenin is stricken into immobility his face hiding in one propped up hand
a tear falls on the blotter
slyudin rescues him ushering the shopkeeper out
countess lydia arrives in full fluttering cry
i have forced my way in
i have heard
countess every shopkeeper has heard
my dear friend
dont give way to sorrow
our lord jesus christ has you in his care
no im done for
i dont understand any thing
all day long im being asked to make decisions about bills and servants the kitchen serozhas clothes
i understand everything
i am going to act
the household arrangements you can leave to me
i will come every day
i will be a second mother to serozha
he clasps both her hands and kisses them
lydia falls to her knees
he that humbleth himself shall be exalted
you must not thank me
thank him whose love pours through me
the sleigh brings levin and kitty home through deep snow all around
the house comes into view
they have been on honeymoon travels attested by hotel labels on the lug gage
kitty eager and anxious looks at the approaching house
not too bad
levin takes her hand
she smiles at him to calm him
agafia and vasili come out on the porch
the house has been painted the window frames smartened up and paper flowers are tied to the posts of the porch
the sleigh pulls up
levin carries kitty through the snow to the porch
this is agafia and vasili the steward
my wife ekaterina alexandrovna levin
i am very pleased to meet you both
kuzma sidles by with a bow and goes to take the luggage from the sleigh
and that was kuzma
careful doors still a bit
to levins look its all right itll be dry tomorrow
levin shows kitty in
he is immensely relieved
it never looked better
at the same time he realises that agafia is agitated a word in private
is it all right
kitty nods smiles gamely its not like home
sit down a minute
no i want to see everything
levin follows agafia out
agafia follows levin up the stairs
she is outraged
and now im doing kitchen maids work because nadyas parents wont let her set foot in this house and who can blame them
levin enters the small bedroom
agafia waits outside
nikolai is in the bed wasted near death
he lies in squalor
masha is wiping his face
she stands up at levins approach
levin bends over niko lai presses his gaunt hand
nikolai opens his eyes
its me konstantin
the doctor here is useless get me a doctor from moscow
where did you go
i asked for you every where when i was getting married
nikolai sighs and closes his eyes
levin retreats looks to masha
i couldnt leave him
i know ive done wrong
you cant stay now
levin goes outside to agafia and closes the door
i couldnt go against nikolai dmitrichs orders
an unwelcome thought strikes levin
did the doctor see her
agafia nods guiltily
kitty has remained
levin in miserable agony is sitting holding her hand
i will nurse him with agafia
the woman will find somewhere in the village
you wont see her
she knows its impossible for you to meet her
it is a torment to me that i have brought you under the same roof as this unfortunate
and in your precious in your delicate condition
kitty detaches herself abruptly and leaves the room
he hears her going upstairs
after a moment he follows
kitty comes out of the guest bedroom
a clean nightshirt and sheets
a towel and a clean pail of warm water
ask agafia for vinegar and to prepare a bed somewhere for masha
kitty goes back into the room and returns at once with a chamber pot which she thrusts at levin
and bring the perfume bottle in the outside pocket of my handbag
she goes back into the room and doesnt return
levin humbled goes down the stairs
nikolai has been stripped
masha washes his body
kitty enters with her arms full of clean linen
nikolai lies naked in clean sheets
masha hauls him up into a sitting posi tion
kitty puts a nightshirt over his head
nikolai protests feebly
im not looking
masha and kitty pull the nightshirt over his body
kitty pulls the sheet up over him
masha adjusts the fresh pillow
she combs his hair and beard
nikolai lies quietly in a neat bed in the neat room with medicine and water jug etc
tidily by the bed
masha keeps vigil by candlelight holding his hand singing to him quietly
levin comes into the room he shared with his brother
the room has been abandoned for years
two bare beds a washstand a wooden chest
it contains a jumble of books shoes a pair of skates
levin hears sleigh bells arriving
the sleigh draws up bringing a priest
levin feeling out of place is at the washstand
he notices there is a prettily wrapped new cake of soap
he picks it up and puts it to his nose
masha and kitty are kneeling by the bed
the priest bends over nikolai holding up an icon in front of nikolais face and murmuring the prayers
levin embarrassed puts down the soap and comes forward and kneels too
nikolai is at the point of death
levin stares torn between the mystery and the lack of mystery the ordinariness of the body finally wearing out
the death rattle comes
masha kisses the dead hand
the priest continues to murmur
kitty takes hold of mashas hand
levin stares into nikolais face if this is death what is life
nikolai lies dead candles burning at his head and feet
levin counts money for the services of the priest
who is eating bread and soup
thank you father
and how much
he offers a handful of paper money
at your benevolence
it is a custom not a levy your excellency
jesus overturned the money tables outside the temple but
he shrugs and puts the money away and returns to his soup
the snow is almost gone
nikolais grave has flowers strewn on the mound
pavas yearling and several more calves delirious with release mill through the yard with the herd to pasture with a herdsman and laska urging them on
masha is leaving alone behind the coachman
she sits quietly and doesnt look back
levin and kitty watch her drive away
youre such an expert on love kostya
why didnt you know it when you saw it
lydia hurries along grand deserted hallways
she knows her way
a door ahead of her opens and a dozen politicians and civil servants carrying portfolios cross her path with stremov at the centre of their unheard conver sation
stremov is smiling triumphant
lydia expects to see karenin among them
she hurries on to the door they came from
when lydia enters karenin alone in the chamber is sitting immobile defeated
he starts gathering his papers
lydia comes to him
her agitation explained she takes an opened letter from her bag
alexei theyre back
here in st
she has written to me
karenin accepts the letter and reads it
i think i dont have the right to refuse
its the boys birthday
you would be blowing on the embers of a fire which must be allowed to die
let me write to her
anna is looking into the display window of a toy shop
she is excited glow ing
she enters the shop
returning from the toy shop with a wrapped parcel anna comes in
luggage is stacked up in the hallway and franz is unpacking stuff in the main room
she sees that a hand delivered letter is waiting for her
she opens it
anna reads the letter
for a moment she is devastated by it but then furious she tears it up
its very early morning
the street is not awake
a hired cab brings anna to her former home
she is heavily veiled and carries the wrapped parcel from the toy shop
the cab is to wait for her
she rings the doorbell
a sleepy servant opens the big wooden door
im here to see sergei alexeyich
the young servant doesnt know her
anna steps past him pushing money into his hand
kapitonich pulling on his livery greatcoat comes to the inner glass door and lets anna in
he does not recognise her
i have brought something for sergei alexeyich
kapitonich scrutinises her prepared to forestall her
he is not up yet
would you wish to wait
who shall i say
kapitonich peers at her and realises who she is
he steps back and bows
please come in your excellency
anna goes quickly to the stairs
allow me to announce you
the tutor may be there and not dressed
anna shakes her head and is almost running away from him
kapitonich gives chase
please allow me
anna dashes past two housemaids who gape at her and disappears round the corner
shes a little mad now
anna wild eyed climbs the stairs and meets the tutor vasily lukich coming down buttoning his waistcoat
lukich is startled not knowing her
ive come to see sergei alexeyich
kapitonich reaches these stairs calling your excellency
anna dashes for serozhas door and flings herself through it
its no longer serozhas room
a large woman sits up in bed
shes probably the cook
she cries out
anna reels back
she looks panicked
kapitonich catches up out of breath
hes been moved to the small sitting room
at the bottom of the upper stairs lukich the housemaids and a couple of half dressed footmen have their heads together
they move aside as anna hurries by seeing nothing
kapitonich catches up with anna at the door of the small sitting room
ill just look in
anna shakes her head and walks past him into the room
the curtains are drawn closed
the room is dim
anna sees serozha sitting up yawning his eyes closed and falling back on the pillow
she comes to the bed and whispers his name
serozha raises himself on his elbow opens his eyes and smiles dreamily and falls forward into her arms
oh my dear little boy
i knew you would come
today is my birthday
serozha rubs his face on her neck falls back on the pillow only half awake and going back to sleep
anna looks at him avidly touching his forearms his shoulders the hair over his ears
she cant stop her own tears
he comes awake
are you crying
i wont cry
its time for you to get dressed
and i almost forgot your present look
serozha takes off her hat
you dont want that
let me see
serozha tears open the package lifts the lid of the cardboard box and finds a puppet a beautifully dressed marionette
oh hes grand
korney the valet among others has joined the conference and is blaming kapitonich
its your fault for letting her in
you should be sacked
oh yes you would have sent her packing
ten years ive been keeping the door and the mistress was always kind to me
you should stick to stealing the masters clothes
ive had enough of this its my job to get the boy out of bed before his excellency comes
lukich cautiously opens the door
he sees mother and son working the pup pet and laughing quietly
lukich backs off
anna looks round to see the door closing
darling kutik maman cant stay
serozha clings to anna
hes not coming yet
yes i must and you must love papa hes better than i am
when youre grown up
no one in the whole world is better than you
anna hugs him
the servants in a huddle look round at the sound of a door and approach ing footsteps round a blind corner
there is no one in view when karenin comes around the corner
the ser vants have vanished
he goes to serozhas door
anna comes out
he stops astonished
anna looks at him boldly then pulls down her veil
anna walks past him
anna comes home from karenins house
the visit has changed her
she sits down in her hat and coat
annushka comes in
shes still asleep
should i take your coat
anna shakes her head
are you feeling unwell madame
im not sleeping
i can send out for something
anna appears not to have moved
the baby is heard crying in another room
annas face remains set but she reacts on hearing vronsky coming in
why are you in the dark
he turns on a gaslight
yashvin is going to call
you remember him
about her clothes are you going out
whats the matter
i didnt know what happened to you
but i told you yesterday
does it take all day for you to meet your brother
does he need you more than i do
vronsky sits next to her and puts his arms round her
anna shakes her head
alexander agreed to everything
mothers house in moscow will go to him and the country estate will be our new home
as soon as the divorce
karenin hasnt answered your letter yet
anna shakes her head
she stands up at last and takes off her hat
yashvin is a welcome visitor
its wonderful to have you both returned
how good you are to come
youre the very first person to call on me since our return
yashvin gets the point of that
he is embarrassed
i received a note from princess betsy asking me if id call on her between six thirty and eight
or was it seven
yashvin got the point of that too
alas between six thirty and seven is just when im unable to see her
but perhaps youll meet at the opera tonight
i would love to be there if i could get a box
madame your box is number four
youll find me there with princess myagkaya
will you come vronsky
vronsky shakes his head
yashvin kisses annas hand
i see why
alexei is so fond of you
yashvin laughs and bows himself out
you know you cant go to the theatre
for heavens sake annushka comes
ill come in and choose a dress
anna i implore you dont you know
im not ashamed of who i am or what ive done are you ashamed for me
why do you keep a room at the hotel
arent we together
have you changed towards me
its because i love you and care about you
if thats the case i dont know why you arent coming with me
that would make it worse
well im not
before the performance the stairs galleries and corridors giving access to the stalls and boxes are crowded with the towns highest society
and anna at her most beautiful is magically cleaving through it
awareness of her presence is like a contagion and yet everyone manages not to catch her eye
so while all around her there are people impeding each other with greetings annas path opens before her
she knows what is happening
it shocks her but her eyes barely show it
the spell is broken by princess myagkaya she of the kopek sauce who hails her
she picks up on the surrounding effect of this and rubs it in with mischief taking annas arm
princess myagkaya contd something has done you good you look wonderful
vronsky sits and broods
angrily he changes his mind
he jumps up call ing for franz
vronskys cab draws up outside the brightly lit deserted opera house
vronsky comes up the stairs
the place is deserted apart from atten dants
one of whom takes vronskys cloak and gives him a token
on stage act one is just ending and the curtain falls
the applause gives way to chatter
should we visit or stay put
anna sees vronsky entering on the side aisle below
he looks up at the boxes seeking her
she turns away
princess myagkaya has engaged the attention of stremov in the neighbour ing box
come in for a moment
but stremov only bows coldly and turns away
yashvin notes this and begins to chew his moustache anxiously
annas neighbour on the other side a meek husband of a battle axe admires her openly
anna sees that vronsky has stopped to talk to countess vronsky and the princesses sorokina
the young princess seems animated by vronsky who bows himself away
princess myagkaya sees where anna is looking
princess myagkaya contd princess sorokina and her daughter theyre from moscow neighbours of countess vron sky quite well off no sons shes a widow
anna gives her a smiling but wounded look
princess myagkaya contd my dear im a sales catalogue
vronsky meets alexander in the aisle and greets him
youll come up to see us afterwards
talk to varya
alexander indicates his seat to vronsky
vronsky sits by varya
will you call on anna
im fond of you
for gods sake anna isnt a criminal
id call on her if shed only broken the law
but she broke the rules
vronsky is angry and offended
he gets up bows to varya
when he looks up he sees betsy beckoning to him from her box
anna watches vronsky sees him acknowledge betsys summons
who has made the decor
havent we got a programme
colonel would you be so kind
annas neighbour emboldened offers her his programme
i would be honoured if you would take mine
thank you how very
the neighbours wife catching this reacts as though electrocuted
princess betsy is smoking
prince tverskoy is examining an ancient book
vronsky enters the box
he bows to the prince and kisses betsys hand
catullus printed in venice
a grovelling house manager appears in their midst to tell betsy she cant smoke in the box
a thousand apologies princess but
princess betsy blows smoke and hands the cigarette in its holder to a figure standing quietly in the shadowy corner of the box makhotin
makhotin takes the cigarette from the holder crushes it in his left palm
he feels humiliated
but thats love
the house manger bows and leaves
the angry wifes voice cuts through the audience chatter
its a disgrace
take me home
vronsky turns round to look
he sees the husband trying to calm his wife
fetch my cloak
vronsky sees anna looking straight ahead
yashvin is eating his moustache
the scene next door is a social catastrophe for anna but she is riding it
princess myagkaya takes her hand
yashvin shrinks into his corner morti fied
the whole opera house is becoming aware of the scandal
the angry wife has raised her voice
what are we coming to
the husband has succeeded in putting his wifes cloak over her shoulders
her exit line is for the benefit of the entire audience
is this the opera house or a or a french music hall
the wife and her husband leave the box
vronsky is tormented
he moves to leave the box
yes why dont you
rescue her and put your seal on the fiasco
vronsky knows it and is trapped
you see why she must divorce
marriage will solve everything
when will it be
as far as im concerned shes my wife
but as you saw she isnt
were going to moscow and then to my place in the country
that sounds like a good idea
but for a day or two anna will be at home at my flat
then ill say goodbye now
angry and upset anna sweeps into the flat in her opera cloak
vronsky follows her in
you had an excellent night
does your mother want you to marry the widow or the child
dont make a joke of it
if you loved me you would have locked me in to stop me going
she throws aside her cloak and goes into the bedroom
annushka asleep in a chair waiting loyally wakes up
go to bed
vronsky comes in as annushka goes out
he comes to anna and puts his arms round her
yes it was my fault
i wont sleep
i know how to make you sleep
vronsky makes love to anna but its not working for her
her eyes stray around
by the bed is a carafe of water an empty glass and a pharmacy bottle as dark as ink with a handwritten label
heat and dust
anna with some dainty shopping by her is taking tea in a genteel cafe
her eye is caught by a mother and son at another table
the boy is a serozha
anna misses her son acutely in that moment
then dolly enters the tea shop
annas heart lifts for a moment and she is about to greet her but then realises that dolly is one of a trio of society ladies and anna lowers her
when she sneaks a look she catches one of the ladies whispering to the others
anna realises that she has been recognised by a stranger and is notorious
she hides in her purse finding money to leave on the table so that she can escape
a sound makes her look up and she sees that dolly has sat down opposite her
i am very glad to see you
are you well
how is your little one
anna nods words wont come
stiva wanted to invite you and count vron sky to the house but its impossible
no no you dont
kitty and her husband are with us
shes in moscow to have the baby
oh tell her how pleased i am
perhaps ill wait a year or two
she gulps a laugh oh
dont you disapprove of me for what ive done
i wish id done the same
but no one asked me
i wouldnt have been brave enough
she blinks tears stiva you know
he doesnt change
like all men i suppose
she doesnt notice her tactlessness but it lands on anna who manages a smile
anna in a nightdress is awake in the night staring out of the grand window of a grand hotel smoking
anna comes back to bed
vronsky is asleep
she unstops a pharmacy bottle a different one and pours a draught mixed with water
anna sleeps alone in the bed
annushka after a tap on the door comes in cautiously worried
anna sits up
are you ill
what time is it
is anya up
its afternoon madame
im all right
its all right
get them to bring up all our trunks and travel cases
weve been here long enough
vronsky comes in noting the empty trunks and cases stacked up
anna comes from her room to greet him
she is making an effort to be pleasant but she looks excited febrile
i had an inspiration
why do we have to wait here
why cant we wait in the coun try
i dont want to hear any more about a divorce or think about it
im bored here
when should we go
if i bore you here ill bore you in the country
i didnt say you bore me
moscow bores me
when should we go
but annas mood has turned
i cant be ready by tomorrow
the day after then
if you like
i have to see maman
thats twenty minutes away in the train you could go to see her tomorrow or was it that you wanted to spend sunday with princess sorokina
please dont spoil everything
i cant see maman tomorrow because she wont have read the papers she has to sign
oh and then theres the bank
but we can leave on tuesday
in that case lets not bother
ill leave on sunday or not at all
its absurd to you because you have no understanding for my life here
youve stopped loving me
youve given up everything for me and its turned you against me
why lie about it
i put off our departure for a day or two and you tell me i dont love you
because ive been living off your love and theres none left so this is over
she leaves him slamming the door
anna comes in and lies down on the bed closes her eyes sits up pours a dose from the medicine bottle by the bed and lies down
vronsky comes in
he takes her hand
i dont mind when we go
ill telegraph maman
well go on sunday
ill do anything you want
you should leave me
i dont want to
i love you
you cant ask why about love
anna comes straight from bed
she is drugged and shaky
the room is empty but there is a coffee tray on the table
anna feels the coffeepot and pours herself a cup
vronsky is at his desk
anna enters with her coffee
vronsky is reading a telegram
seeing her enter he puts the telegram under his papers
so will you be all packed
ill be out today making the arrangements
is that your way of telling me youll be at your mothers with that simpering little princess
ill be with my lawyers
im waiting for some documents
then im having dinner to say goodbye to old comrades
well i know what that means
my god this is unendurable
he controls himself
i can invite them here if you like
thank you but if im not fit to dine in soci ety i wont eat with the band
who was the telegram from
vronsky retrieves the telegram and hands it to her
i didnt show it to you because stiva keeps telegraphing what we already know
kare nin promises nothing but will consider
anna tosses the telegram aside unread
i told you i dont care about the divorce so why hide the telegram
what else do you hide from me
i hide nothing from you
why do you care about the divorce
what has it got to do with us loving each other
until were married our daughter is legally karenins
i care about it because we need to be free to marry
youre perfectly free to marry anyone your mother wants
but we arent talking about yes we are and by the way compared to your mother im the virgin mary
vronsky is silent with anger
he gets up and goes out returning with his hat in his hand
is there anything you wish to say to me
she remains silent
he leaves again
she lights a cigarette
the sorokina coach draws up outside the door
the coach with its crest and the coachmans livery a bright yellow cockade are highly distinctive
anna with her cup of coffee comes in and looks down from the window
vronsky hat in hand at the coach window accepts a large envelope from a lilac gloved hand
with a wave of the hand and a flash of golden hair the coach pulls away
vronsky goes back inside
with the envelope vronsky comes in
anna is as he left her the cigarette stubbed out
so its the child
she brought papers from maman
he hesitates thinking she is about to speak
she stays silent
anna finds annushka filling several half filled cases
were not going
she lies down on the bed
annushka would like to comfort her
when count vronsky comes back tell him
i dont want to be disturbed
anna is listening for vronskys return
she hears him come in
she hears him approach
then she hears annushkas voice then vronskys voice
she waits in suspense disappointed as vronskys steps retreat
anna holding a candle lamp finds vronsky asleep on the couch
she hesi tates but turns away
she re collects herself
she looks at the bedside clock
in a sud den hurry she leaves the bed and the bedroom
anna finds annushka waiting
he went out early to the stables he said
anna collapses on a chair and weeps
i should have died
do you remember
dont take it to heart anna arkadyeva
ive made him hate me
annas hand writes in a hurry im to blame
anna seals the note and gives it to annushka
tell michael to hurry
annushka runs out with the note
anna is keeping watch at the window
and is rewarded by the return ing coach
she hurries out
anna looks down into the entrance hall
michael the coachman comes in and comes up the stairs to her
she sees that he is holding her note
count vronsky had already left your excel lency
he took a cab to the station
to the countess
anna clutches her red bag to her sitting among passengers
anna looks about her
across the carriage she sees through the window that her train is overtaking another passenger train on the next line
she looks at the windows of the other train going by
seeing the pas sengers inside
unexpectedly she seems to see a man who might be vronsky sitting opposite a laughing woman who might be princess sorokina
annas body jerks involuntarily
she half rises
the image however is brief and is borne away as her own train goes by accelerating
the win dows opposite pick up speed as she leaves them behind and then she has the same illusion again a vronsky and a sorokina glimpsed in the other train
and snatched away in the instant
now she stands up and goes to the opposite window where the windows of the other train are flashing by in the anachronistic manner of pro jected film frames and
she sees vronskys and sorokinas flashing by at gathering speed
and then the train has gone and theres nothing going by but the view
anna collapses into the nearest seat
the train arrives at a small station
anna steps down from the train
the platform is well populated by people waiting to board the train or to meet the arriving passengers
there is an energy about the people shouting laughter movement
porters shout for custom
a couple of young men seem to be laughing rudely directly at her but they pass by ignoring her
anna pauses bewildered lost not knowing what to do next
she sees the sorokina coachman on the platform recognising his distinctive livery a cockade in his hat
are you waiting for the princess sorokina
no your excellency both princesses are at the house of countess vronsky
im waiting anna turns back agitated expecting vronsky to appear but what comes is a footman carrying three hatboxes and a large box from a dress shop
anna walks away along the platform impeded by people going by her aware that some are staring at her as she passes
a boy selling drinks grins at her
a little group of ladies and children meeting a bespectacled man off the train are laughing and chattering but fall silent and look at her
she increases her pace
she hurries away towards the far end of the platform
beyond her a goods train is slowly approaching
between her and the train two maidservants are walking towards her
they turn their heads to look at her remarking on her dress
look at that lace on her
there is a rough bench near the end of the platform
anna reaches it and sits down
the two girls turn again to look back at her and are struck by the sight of anna sitting alone in profile
the goods train reaches her and the first wagon goes past her
the two girls stop and watch vaguely puzzled by her
as they watch the beautiful woman on the bench gets up and walks the few steps to the edge of the wooden platform and into the path of the train
disappearing from view between the wheels of one of the wagons
lying separate against a rail is clipped by a rolling train wheel and knocked aside spilling its contents
a scythe cuts a swathe through standing hay
its nearly the last of the hay
the scythe is being swung by theodore known from last year
he is one of a dozen mowers
levin is among them wielding his scythe
they have almost reached the end of the field where the last of the hay is being pitchforked up on to the last piled cart
theodores daughter in law now visibly pregnant is still adept with a pitchfork
its a lowering thundery day at the end of summer
ill be buying in feed before winters over
well you dont press people hard but you live rightly for your soul not your belly
i know what my belly is
how do we know whats rightly
i believe in reason
and was it reason that made you chose a wife
youre a great one for reasoning konstantin dmitrich but whats rightly is outside your mathematic thats whats rightly about it
this stops levins scythe
he is illumined
theodore swings the scythe again
levin walks away gives his scythe to a labourer by the cart and keeps walking
he quickens his pace
the first drops of rain few and heavy arrive
cries of alarm and laughter burst from a mushrooming party approaching the house
children run ahead the adults walk faster then run helping with baby carriages and picking up small children and baskets of mush rooms
urged on from the porch by agafia
levin coming from the hay field joins the rout
the grown ups are levin oblonsky dolly the oblonsky nurse prince and princess shcherbatsky
the children are tanya grisha masha lili and vasili
dolly carries her youngest
the children are eighteen months older than when we first saw them
the heavens open as everyone gets under cover
wheres ekaterina alexandrovna
its all right the mistress is giving mitya his bath
it is evident from her tone that kitty and agafia have made it up long ago
rain on the window and on the roof
the rain is so loud that it is the foreground sound in the scene and the dialogue while we can pick it out without difficulty is the background sound
levin enters wet
dmitri mitya two months old is lying on his back in a basin supported by kittys palm under his head
kitty squeezes a sponge over his body which he likes
i came looking for you
i understood something
and what was that
kitty lifts mitya onto a towel on her lap wraps him and gives him to levin who is enchanted by him
he smiled at me
hes very advanced for his age
she picks up her rings to replace them on her fingers
what did you understand
but the baby starts to yell for the breast
kitty starts to undo her blouse
levin shakes his head hell tell her some other time or maybe not
the storm has passed
oblonsky comes from inside and lights a cigar
indistinctly seen and heard through the window the mushrooming party occupies the dining room
oblonsky smokes thoughtfully melancholy
baby anya old enough to stagger on her feet wavers through wild flowers half her height
she falls over almost disappearing
this is being watched with a mixture more pleasure than pain by kar enin
he is in early retirement sitting with a book in a garden seat dressed comfortably under a straw hat
there is the sound over of people playing croquet
serozha aged ten enters his view going to anya to haul her upright and keeping hold of her hand as she staggers on
karenins pleasure increases slightly
over this the growing sound of a battlefield
vronsky in an unfamiliar uniform sabre pointing forward is mounted at full gallop with the sound of the charge all around him in the smoke and noise of guns
something heavy and invisible with its own sound like the flap of an awning takes him from his horse into the air and gone leaving spouts of blood poised for
an instant in the smoke
serozha picks up anya like a parcel under his arm and walks on with her towards the indistinct figures of croquet players strolling in the heat haze a couple of
parasols held aloft
