href b b solaris by steven soderbergh october draft by steven soderbergh october first over black we hear the sound of a light rain
then im not a poet
ive never moved anyone with my words
beat maybe thats why they chose me
a mural of leafless trees beneath an overcast sky
rain continues to fall
maybe now we begin to notice a strange quality to the light or is it the sky
something vaguely unsettling
still the sound of rain is heard
s lies on his side in bed staring at us
he has not been sleeping
in fact judging from his distant expression he has not slept in ages
less like a road and more like a path that you maneuver a vehicle through
the man dressed in rain gear walks down the middle
he is accompanied by a medium sized labrador and seems in no particular hurry
the sound of tires appear and grow in intensity
the man without saying an actual word instructs the dog to heal
the dog obeys as the man moves off the road
the vehicle hurtles past him its engine quiet its windows darkened spraying muddy debris in its wake
seconds later the car brakes abruptly and skids to a stop
stops walking and stares at the car which seems ominously still
the car then reverses direction and begins to move toward the man who remains motionless
when the car is alongside him a darkened window turns transparent and we see a well dressed bureaucrat in the rear seat
his demeanor is pleasant and professional
the man he is addressing who we now understand is chris kelvin stares back at him
the contrast between the cabins rustic aesthetic and the aggressively high tech equipment contained therein isnt as jarring as you might imagine
kelvin is seated in front of a desk scrolling through a text readout on a flat transparent holographic screen
behind him is the well dressed bureaucrat from the car and two others a woman in her s and a man in his s
they are also well groomed
each of their suits are embroidered with a small but distinctive logo of some sort that composes the acronym dba
kelvin scrolls through several menus hits a few keys and a digitized video image appears on his screen a man unshaven looking into the camera
the man gibarian looks very tired and somewhat apologetic
the lower part of the screen has a time of day and date display that reads hrs
we take off into the cosmos ready for anything solitude hardship exhaustion death
were proud of ourselves in a way
but our enthusiasm is a sham
we dont want to conquer the cosmos we want to extend the boundaries of earth to the cosmos
we are only seeking man
we dont want other worlds
we want mirrors
beat maybe we dont need to know what it is or why
maybe just knowing that it is should be enough
gibarian stares at the camera for a long moment before switching it off and ending the transmission
kelvin sits back
the visitors exchange glances
close on kelvin
we hold on him a long time as a myriad of readouts scroll and flash across his face
a slit of sunlight glides slowly through frame
in the same capsule a month later
he is asleep
in the same capsule two months later
he is dictating some coordinates to earth
he absently scratches his heavy growth of beard
two months later still
he is looking out his small rectangular window and for the fist time we cut around to see the approaching planet solaris
kelvin stares at it hypnotized
it has a translucent quality as though it is lit from within and its undulating ocean like surface slowly changes colors
kelvins attention is diverted as an orbiting ship the prometheus edges into frame
prometheus this is athena on approach do you read me
beat prometheus this is athena on approach do you read me
he exhales and types on a keyboard
the athena sporting a dba logo advances toward the prometheus
kelvin in a space suit climbs with some difficulty out of the athena which has come to rest in the docking bay of the prometheus
several exploratory pods fill the remainder of the area
kelvin gets his bearings and looks around but sees no sign of life
note except for some robotic non speaking characters the automated taskmasters
these are small bug like repair units that constantly roam the ship fixing things
their tiny hum is virtually silent and we see them all the time on the prometheus
they can adhere to any surface at any angle
kelvin now out of his space suit and holding a small carrying case and a duffle bag moves on
kelvin registers it then moves to the corner of the room where the computer terminal rests
within moments he has discovered gibarian has recorded a video message for him to replay
gibarian addressing the camera
he appears to be lucid but extremely fatigued
a light smile im so glad you came
beat the smile fades i still have a little time and i want to tell you something
to warn you
by now you know about me or if you dont get snow or sartorius to tell you it doesnt matter
beat i didnt lose my mind
you should be able to tell from this video
im not mad
beat if it happens to you remember that it isnt madness
beat you should know im in favor of destroying solaris
i know thats
but its the only way to make it stop
a long moment of silence is broken by a noise on the video which draws gibarians attention offscreen
addressing whoever made the noise cut that out
do you hear me
gibarian switches off the video
the computer screen freezes the last recorded frame and overlays a readout indicating the file has ended
but there is a door at the end of it slightly open
kelvin moves toward it
a figure seated with its back to the door turns to see kelvin enter
this is snow
he looks kelvin up and down his expression wary and alert
didnt you hear me radio
a long beat
snow just watches him
kelvin takes a step forward and snow recoils
what happened to gibarian
snow exhales then looks up as though hes remembered something
you didnt bring any chocolate did you
musing i love chocolate
i realized just yesterday how much i love it
beat then he recovers i thought maybe if they let you bring personal effects you might have snuck some through because
well ive been thinking about it
a long beat as kelvin stares at snow
what happened here
snow lies back in his bunk
i cant talk just now
im too tired
in his lab
he wont let you in
leaving hell let me in
kelvin if you see anything unusual
kelvin stops but doesnt turn around
try to stay calm
kelvin stands outside a door
let me in
inside muffled you have to give me your word you wont come in
then ill come out
sartorius cracks the door open and slithers through the slit and into the hallway
he is of obvious intelligence and not to be messed with contentious intimidating when he wants to be and probably brilliant
kelvin eyes him suspiciously
what happened to gibarian
didnt you talk to snow
i want to hear your version
incredulous who here could possibly care what you want
at best youre employee of the month for the highest bidder in the solaris auction
they have no idea whats going on up here
theyve never even been in space
and im supposed to listen to you
i am here to recover this mission report my findings and make a recommendation
now what happened to him
the same thing that could happen to any of us
wheres his body
in the lab
with her probably
who are you talking about
sartorius is grabbed by something on the other side of his door
he struggles to keep his composure
his last wish was to be buried on earth
in dirt he said
i want to buried in dirt
what a clown
sartorius is losing the battle with whomever or whatever is on the other side of his door
they shouldnt let people like you into space
just so you know im not going back until i understand what it is
i am going to figure out what it is make it stop and then i will go home
listen were done
oh i should tell you i dont trust snow
theres something wrong with him
sartorius rotates and zips back into his room
as the door closes kelvin sees a flash of another figure in sartorius room
the glimpse was too quick to judge who or what the other figure could have been
kelvin walks exploring the ship
he sees something that stops him black early s slipping across a corridor up ahead
kelvin gives chase
he sees her turn a corner but by the time he gets there she is gone
snow is lying on his bunk
is there anybody else here
sits up a little why who did you see
gibarian warned me
he left me a message
who was it
she was real
where did she come from
snow looks at him but doesnt respond
i wont think youre insane
oh thats a relief
snow lies back down
where did she come from
how much sleep do you need
how much sleep
how long can you go without sleep
well when you do go to sleep barricade your door
snow rolls over away from kelvin
quiet but still active somehow
the prometheus as far as i can tell is functionally intact
crew status one dead gibarian
cause of death appears to be suicide
kelvin speaks into a video communication device
as he does we see images of the things and people he describes
interviews with the surviving members and a perusal of the deceaseds personal effects indicate he was suffering from severe depression with psychotic features along with bouts of hypomania dementia delirium
and primary insomnia
all of these symptoms combined with a profound sense of isolation are commonly found in studies of low stimulation environments particularly long range space travel
snow and sartorius show indications of depression including dysthymic and bipolar i a variety of stress disorders including acute and posttraumatic and suggestions of agoraphobia obsessive compulsive disorder and hypersomnia
i emphasize these are preliminary opinions on my part
i will attempt to convince snow and sartorius to return to earth but as they currently view me as an intruder of sorts this may take some time
kelvin is lying down
the lights are out and he is trying to sleep
after a moment he gets up checks the lock on his door and lies back down
then he gets up and moves a chair in front of the door and lies back down
then he gets up and puts two heavy cases on top of the chair and lies back down
laughing to himself he drifts off to sleep
on kelvin asleep
on kelvin still asleep
then a womans lips slightly parted
then continued silence and rheya s staring at us practically daring us to look away
her obvious intelligence and confidence make her extremely compelling along with the fact that it was her parted lips we were looking at a moment ago
her expression indicates shes in a very raw emotional state
kelvin is the person she has locked eyes with on the train
he is younger here not just in age but in spirit
the contrast with his older self is striking
asleep on the ship
after a beat rheyas lips
except the circumstance is clearly different its darker and there isnt the side to side shimmy of the train car
reveals that rheya is not sitting on the train she is sitting in kelvins room on the prometheus right now
she is staring at kelvin and she is ethereal in her stillness
awakens blinks and slowly recognizes her
if he is not entirely surprised it is because he has obviously dreamed of rheya before
he looks at her simply
stands and makes her way to kelvin
without hesitation she kisses him and they begin to explore each other and we see all of it happen and two things are obvious first they have done this before
and two they havent done it in some time
kelvin is asleep rheya in his arms
he wakes up and looks at her perplexed
after a beat he rises to sit on the edge of the bed
a wave of terror is barely suppressed as he puts his hand to his forehead
rheya opens her eyes
he looks at her
where did you come from
she moves to him and kisses him as if thats all she wants to do forever
how are you here
how do you mean
beat chris whats wrong
hearing his name spoken by her and those particular words perhaps nearly causes kelvin to scream
he stands and moves to the chair
rheya watches him
i love you
he looks up at her for as long as he can
then he looks down
do you love me
he doesnt look up
i need to see snow
ill go with you
rising ill just be a minute
she bolts out of bed
i dont know
i cant be alone
ill be right back
she is trying to accommodate him but her fear of being left alone is palpable even excessive
he sees this and puts his arms on her shoulders to comfort her
he hands her a few pills and retrieves a glass of water
what are they
to calm your anxiety
to calm my anxiety
she takes the pills and smiles
kelvin leads rheya to one of the exploratory pods
they are in space suits
were taking a flight
he opens the door of a pod and indicates for her to enter
she is unsure
ill close the door behind me
she stares up and into the pod
kelvin watches her go with difficulty and then closes the door behind rheya
he walks across the docking bay to the control room and begins preparations for the pod to be jettisoned
in agony as he watches a real time beat by beat brand of technological murder take place rheyas pod is pushed off into space
her face contorted in confusion watches through the pod window as the docking bay doors close in front of her with a brutal finality
collapses to the ground shattered
a womans hand resting on the floor of an apartment
the fingers are being licked by a labrador puppy
a pot of coffee on the boil
except that it has been left unattended for too long
a rain streaked window
kelvin on the edge of his bed
he wants to tear himself inside out
a voice calls over the intercom snows
was her breakfast conversation that bad
i told you try to stay calm
youre supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch
what was it
kelvin rises and goes to wash his face
personally i think its god
at least it fits my definition
im not sure
beat it started with gibarian
he locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door
he covered the video lens
obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown
i dont know why he didnt tell us he had somebody in there
by this time we were getting visitors too
he was desperately trying to figure it out
day and night
beat who was she
she has materialized from your memory of her
what was her name
it started about three months ago
right after the government sold the expedition
we were ready to go home
will she come back
i wish youd told me
told you what
what will you say
what are you going to report back to earth
i dont know
an enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project
we are in little danger of being left alone for long
beat youll need to do something
otherwise theyll be sending someone out to recover you
gibarian said he thinks solaris should be destroyed
this is contact
we have found god
the only issue is figuring out how to prove this in a way that will make sense back on earth
so how will we describe it if we choose to describe it at all
before kelvins arrival
gibarian is talking to snow and sartorius
a pre biological colloidal envelope possibly exceeding terrestrial structures in complexity a plasmic mechanism
probably without life as we conceive it but capable of performing functional activities on an astronomic scale
my view is that solaris has reached in a single bound the homeostatic ocean stage without passing through stages of terrestrial evolution
i think it bypassed cellular development altogether
it hasnt taken endless eons to adapt itself to its environment but in fact dominated its environment immediately
from the moment it existed it was the most superior element in the universe
and now it passes the time doing extravagant theoretical thinking about the universe with us as the cast
we now show this scene being played out on a video monitor watched by kelvin
its engaged in a never ending process of transformation an ontological autometamorphosis begging the question can thought exist separately from consciousness
i dont care what it is we need to figure out how to make it stop
nelson we have the opportunity what if this thing follows us back to earth
what if whats happening here started happening on earth on a mass scale
dont you see that as a problem
i think its a serious mistake to assume its benign
for all we know its driving us crazy so it can watch us kill each other
gibarian considers this
were not even sure it will let us leave
this time gibarian alone
near the end
maybe its stuck
maybe its power isnt that god like
i mean we have god like power relative to an insect but that doesnt mean we can move the earth around at will
maybe its like a spider web waiting for something to show up
beat we intercepted some brief fragments of what must be an everlasting monologue with itself
of course it was beyond our understanding
beat ive come to hate it here
theres only one way out of its reach for us
kelvin stares at gibarians body which is lying under a sheet in the ships operating room
also under the sheet next to gibarian the young girl
from a video i thought id been behaving normally rationally
but a sign of insanity is the inability to think about more than one thing
so if i am consumed by the idea that i am insane and cant think of anything else then i am insane
beat smiles you ask questions at the end of your life the sort of questions people who are content dont ask
beat maybe life just cant be solved
a shot hovering over the surface of solaris
kelvin is lying down looking at the door
after a beat he turns out the lights and rolls over
time has passed
kelvin is asleep
rheya leans into frame and kisses him
without even waking he kisses her back hungrily
i want you inside me right now
they make love
its even better than before
kelvin and rheya are asleep
kelvin staring intently
what he is staring at is rheya who is seated across from him
she doesnt see him yet
when she does she locks eyes with his and doesnt look away
this continues until she gets off the train
kelvin watches her go and she looks back at him through the window as the train pulls away
rheya enters looks around
she spots kelvin who has already spotted her
their expressions indicate they are pleased to see each other again
he approaches her and they stare at each other a long time until and death shall have no dominion
i thought of it when i saw you on the train
my thomas is a little rusty
he leans over and whispers into her ear
she listens and when he finishes she leans back and looks at him intrigued
not a very happy poem
you didnt look very happy
he nods and they smile
they seem to be rooting for each other
after an extended pleasurable moment rheya leans over and whispers in his ear
he listens then leans back and looks at her
thats good to know
rheya is wound up
not drunk something else
she has an odd look in her eyes
we are at a dinner party and there are people trying but failing not to watch
you want to fuck her
you behave as though you want to fuck her
and i just want to know if im crazy or not if what i think is happening is actually happening
or am i one of those people those women who are blind to whats going on
who pretend not to see their husbands attention toward another woman
lets go home
you go home
please come with me
i dont want to do this here
you talk like an actor
he is stung
the immediate aftermath of the preceding scene but at home now
rheya crying as she embraces kelvin
im so sorry
im so sorry
he is unmoved but she labors to change his mind
rheya in a chair remorseful kelvin is dressing
youre better when you take them
i know i know
but still somehow i dont feel better
how about i feel better when you take them
they look at each other and understand she will take the pills
rheya on the floor dead
her hand outstretched a repeat of an image we saw earlier
rain streaks the kitchen window
the bottle of pills nearby
rheya is taking her pills
what do you remember
what do you mean
do you remember beethoven
movies books restaurants friends
but not until you mentioned them
as soon as you said those things i remembered them
and they have associations that make me think of other things i remember
its like filling up
she looks out the portal at solaris
is it a planet
it exists in a continuum that wasnt proven until ten years ago a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the universe
an infinite number of them in fact
it was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the universe space or space time
it was completely counter intuitive
we had to unlearn everything
is it intelligent
intelligent beyond our comprehension
then its god right
you still dont believe in god
the whole idea of god was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called man
even the limits we put on it are human limits
it can do this it can do that
it designs it creates
even a god that wasnt active that just created something and stood back and watched
youre talking about a man in a white beard again
youre ascribing human characteristics to something that isnt human
human beings look for causes and patterns
how could we know what solaris is up to if anything
but what if solaris is what there was before the big bang
as i said it is beyond our comprehension
as i said then its god right
she looks at him and cant keep from smiling eventually
why are we talking about this shit when we could be fucking
the intercom comes to life
kelvin you awake
what is it
can you meet me and sartorius on b deck in an hour
just a little strategy session
but in person this time
kelvin is getting ready to leave
rheya sits on the edge of the bed nervous
she nods and kelvin exits locking the door behind him
we sit with her for a moment as she tries to remain calm
a long time
satisfied he begins to walk away but is stopped by the sounding of a crashing glass from within
he hears footsteps approach the door and then a fierce pounding
he takes a step back
an inhuman amount of noise begins emanating from the other side of the door which is now threatening to break apart
it sounds like a plane is crashing in kelvins room no human could create this kind of cacophony
finally he steps forward and presses the button to open the door
is revealed covered in blood
she has completely torn the inside of the cabin door apart and has badly injured herself in the process
confused she looks up at him as he takes her in his arms and carries her to the bed
you were trying to break down the door
do you know why
when i saw you were gone i got scared
he puts her down on the bed and runs to the bathroom where he gathers all the first aid materials he can find
returning he blanches
rheyas wounds have healed in fact they are healing in front of us
she looks up at him and doesnt like the look on his face
chris whats wrong with me
kelvin runs rheya through a battery of tests and studies the results
am i all right
snow and sartorius wait for kelvin
he wont do it
why do you say that
kelvin enters with rheya
snow and sartorius exchange glances
this is my wife rheya
she looks at snow and nods
sartorius she hates instantly and the feeling seems to be mutual
we thought youd be alone
we want to talk about
we want to talk freely
i suggest we pool our knowledge regarding the
we can express whatever questions or conclusions we might have
share information about our various
kelvin and snow nod
i would like to start with motivation
why are they here
sartorius looks at rheya
she looks away
they are not autonomous individuals and theyre not actual persons
they are projections materializing from our minds based on a given individual
its an experiment
theres no behavior modification
she reappeared exactly as she had before
kelvin looks at rheya and nods
she is struck by the word before
the same vulnerabilities
he nods again
a recoil with no compensating mechanism
and when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the
original the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness
followed by non human manifestations
are the actions of solaris premeditated
is it being deliberately cruel you mean
i dont think so
im just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances
to rheya when you cut yourself pounding the door did it hurt
looks around of course
if theyre not learning anything and theyre not modifying their behavior why do they come back
its like theyre plugged into a game which goes around and around endlessly repeating itself
this is ten years ago
rheya enters alone
she crosses to the kitchen and makes a drink
almost immediately the labrador puppy enters from the bedroom and stands beside her tail wagging
she ignores it and continues mixing her drink
halfway through this activity the bedroom light comes on
a moment later kelvin is in the doorway
eventually but not angrily because hes still not really awake whereve you been
i been thinking about how much i hate you
she finishes making her drink drinks it and walks out the door
kelvin stands in the doorway for a beat then pivots and returns to bed
the light goes out
yes i remember that
i went back to lois house and spent the night
those were dark days
kelvin and rheya later in the evening when they spoke for the first time
they are absolutely infatuated with each other they know something is happening between them will happen between them
i would have these i dont know how to describe them visions when i was younger
maybe not visions but like these waking dream states
time would just collapse i would be inside time
i would stare at a second hand on a clock until it stopped
how old were you
so one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space and she asks me what im doing and i start trying to explain to her about this
state that i can put myself in and this look comes over her face
what kind of look
kelvin and rheya sit together in the prometheus
rheya continues her story without a beat
no not scared
like i was something to be
her guard went up
i was a threat
now i know why
she was afraid shed be seen
that i would see her for the self obsessed neurotic that she was
i think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal
but thats the cycle right
i knew a little more than she did she knew a little more than her mother and on and on
beat i guess thats part of the reason why i know
we dont have to talk about that
i remember days of just thinking about you
intercut kelvin and rheya at their respective jobs going through a normal day
there is no sound
as we see these images its clear that kelvin and rheya are slightly not present in their respective encounters with other people they are distracted by the idea of each
and they like it
thinking what you were doing and saying just being consumed by thinking of you
i loved it so much that feeling
i did too
rheya on the edge of the bed facing away
i used to watch you undress
as she does i never tired of watching you undress
every time it was exciting
to the end
then a shot of kelvin that weve seen before him leaving their apartment angry
what happened to us exactly
you dont know
rheya shakes her head
kelvin just watches her
the rain streaked window
an automated coffee maker has been left on and the solidified coffee at the bottom of the pot is smoking
rheyas body is on the floor of the kitchen
she is looking at kelvin
he is dreading this
you found me
its coming back to her
kelvin is yelling at rheya
we dont hear what hes saying but judging from her reaction its not pleasant
she is crying
experiencing this all over again
kelvin comes and sits in front of her
kelvin still yelling is packing some things into a suitcase
rheya between sobs pleads with him
her eyes fill with tears
kelvin embraces her
rheya is devastated inconsolable
why did you say those things
i dont know
i couldnt understand why you didnt tell me
rheya lies on the kitchen floor dead
there is a note in her hand
kelvin kneels next to her
with rheya still in his arms
when you said you wouldnt make it
i didnt believe you
or i didnt take you seriously which is worse
kelvin holds the dead rheya
i should have believed you
kelvin lies in bed his eyes open
rheya is in his arms
rheya talking to chris
obviously during a period when they were getting along
or at least not fighting
i cant help feeling that im cheating when i take them
you know this
you know where it comes from
there is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires
she knows intellectually that he is right
but it doesnt matter
kelvin is out of bed and speaking into a videophone to snow
rheya is asleep in the background
the room is dark except for the glow of the screen
youre unnerved because youve spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you and suddenly your subconscious is an open book
we are for the first time experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own
that proves that we are not sure of that
we are not sure we arent all hallucinating
if god is beyond our comprehension and she meaning rheya is here for reasons that cant be understood isnt god here
unbelievable how you equivocate
you the atheist youre more dogmatic than any holy person ive ever seen
this is happening kevin
consciousness is enough thats all ive saying
consciousness should be enough for anybody
who are you trying to convince
kelvin just looks back at rheya
it will end badly
as inevitably as the rising of a bubble
kelvin doesnt respond
lets all meet tomorrow
sartorius has some new ideas about making it stop
kelvin just keeps staring at rheya asleep
kelvin is eating with rheya
looking at her
do you have any idea how much i like fucking you
i think so
because i want you to know
i really like fucking you
he leans over and whispers in her ear
she smiles and leans back
i like that too
how could she not be real
i can smell her taste her
she does exactly what she did
its not possible
smiles teasing you know ive decided im just gonna believe what you believe about this whole solaris thing itll make life so much easier the little wife agreeing with her
big strong husband
you must get such a headache thinking about those great big problems all day
he just stares at her he really likes this
its familiar this type of teasing and it reminds him of when things were good
like i said its not possible
so chris seriously arent you afraid youre going to get fired
kelvin and rheya post coital
on the verge of sleep
you sure say god a lot when were doing it
im putting that in my next report
report and recommend
they consider that
what does snow think you should do
snow thinks we shouldnt leave until we figure out a way to document it to prove its existence to the planet earth
this is hilarious he thinks its god but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home
they smile at this
rheyas smile fades before kelvins
sartorius wants to destroy it
he doesnt think its god but for different reasons than me
hes thinking if i can figure out how to make it stop than i am smarter than it is and therefore it cannot be god
he has a point
he does have a point
thats just not the way id like to see it proven
you feel sorry for solaris or for me
its a violent response to something we havent figured out
dont let the cowardly demeanor fool you he is ruthless
unblinking in his prejudice
it was obvious from the way he first looked at me
he holds her
do i really feel like
then years ago
kelvin naked sitting in a chair in the dark
rheya also naked is smoking a cigarette in bed
everything you pursue you end up becoming disinterested in
the fact that youre good at everything you try makes it worse
you have a degree in animal science you could be a terrific vet
you drifted into writing and turned out to be a perceptive journalist
then it was politics which seemed best of all you had an actual gift for understanding the best pattern for a group of people to be arranged for you to
achieve your goal
and they didnt even know they were being arranged
but you got bored with it like you do with everything
she just smokes not really looking at him
maybe its a common observation and shes past being defensive about it
i dont know what its really like to not know what you want to do
to not have anything that you love to do more than anything else
he looks at her
she seems more interested in her cigarette at the moment
sarcastic imagine my frustration
on the prometheus
rheya is awake kelvin asleep
she rises and goes to sit in a chair she is anxious something we havent seen before
kelvin wakes up looks at her
noting her expression whats wrong
you dont love me
she looks down
i have to talk to you
i dont know where i came from
up at him do you know
he doesnt respond
if you know but cant tell me now
will you ever be able to
calmly what are you talking about
that i am not rheya
that rheya died
hes looking at her and knows this is dangerous territory
who have you been talking to
no reason to lie sartorius
when im asleep
he can only imagine what form sartorius anecdotes must have taken
im sure there are worse people to talk to but i dont know who they are
im just trying to understand whats going on
how have you lived the last ten years
did you love anyone
a long beat
kelvin shakes his head
did you think about me
then but we fought
especially toward the end
why did she do it
she said i didnt love her
was she right
i love you
reflexive but genuine i love you too
if she seems satisfied for the moment kelvin knows the feeling wont last
can you sleep
i dont think do
its not sleep its something else
its all around me
those are dreams
she falls asleep
kelvin rheya sartorius and snow
they are in the middle of a heated discussion
gibarian was under enormous gibarian was helpless
its very simple man created the science that resulted in the discovery of solaris and the ship that brought us here
meaning man can do whatever the fuck it wants
why did you agree to come here
too tired to answer
looks at rheya then back to kelvin
is this what they sent you here to do
youve lost it youve gone native
kelvin moves toward him
sartorius just lets him come
to sartorius youre the coward
dont debate him hell say anything
still to sartorius im just as human as you
i see i hear i touch and i feel just like you do
these guests are a part of you of your subconscious
chris loves me
you are not human
try to understand that if you can understand anything
kelvin is within an inch of his face
get out of here
slowly carefully sartorius grasps kelvin by the shoulders
then he leans in and whispers in kelvins ear rheya is dead
shes a copy
and shes seducing you all over again
you think of fucking her as research for humanity
its just fucking
kelvin backs away
theres nothing grandiose about it
youve jumped out of a plane and youre trying to sew a parachute together while you fall
itd be hilarious if it werent so damn sad
we didnt even get to hear his new ideas
snow wanders toward the door
im not feeling well
he passes kelvin and leaves
kelvin watches him then looks at rheya
she seems dazed
the fog shrouded surface shifting and turning like an ocean
rheya is asleep
kelvin is talking to snow on the videophone
we can liquidate the station
take the athena back
of course when we return well be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth
shrugs well chalk it up to isolation collective derangement
ive never heard you express any desire to leave before now
well i think were reaching the point of diminishing returns here right
certainly its learning more about us than well ever learn about it
but why is it doing what its doing
given its resources it could have done anything
presented me with your double and you with mine
perhaps it did
human beings can die
but they are human
they certainly become human with incredible speed
first theyre like they were in our memory but then they fill in on their own
dna doesnt determine the hundreds of trillions of connections that occur in the brain its not dense enough
they build up with experience
quick glimpses of rheya
in several of them she is in repose thinking as if to illustrate snows point
back to kelvin thinking
they come when you sleep
and we all have to sleep eventually
kelvin on the bed with rheya
their eyes are closed
we think they are asleep until you dont want me
thats what you were saying
i heard what you were saying
for a reason that neither of us understand you are forced to stay near me
thats all i know right now
she realizes she doesnt want to argue
not right now anyway
i have these strange thoughts i dont know where they come from
beat i cant explain it
neither can i
not any of it
theres no reference point for whats going on its never happened before
its a clean break in the fabric of the universe a gap
there is nothing to do but experience it moment to moment and not let it destroy us
but thats what happened before
not this time
he kisses her
she wants to believe him so she says nothing
then do you want to stay here
if youre here
they kiss again
kelvin is asleep
rheya is next to him
offscreen we hear the door open
someone walks quietly though not surreptitiously through the frame and sits
after a long beat kelvin bolts upright his mind struggling to clear
when it does gibarian
leave the light off
kelvin tries to get his bearings
i wish youd come a little sooner
i might not have had to kill myself
he smiles looking at kelvin
you think youre dreaming me like you dream her
understand something i am the real gibarian
just a new incarnation
what do you want
youre being tricked
sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors
hes figured out theyre made of subatomic particles called neutrinos and hes going to create a negative neutrino field
twenty four hours a day until theyre back on earth
can it work
ordinary matter like ours
everything else disintegrates
kelvin registers this
what im saying is dont trust anyone
find yourself a weapon of some sort
i can trust rheya
youll end up like me
youre not gibarian
who am i then
and youre not
maybe youre my puppet
but like all puppets you think youre actually human
its the puppets dream
wondering if theyre human
wakes up gulping air
rheya startled whats wrong
he was here
you said he was dead
but he was here
he moves to the chair looking for some residue of gibarian some proof
finding none he spoke to me
kelvin leaves the room
after a few beats rheya follows
rheya lingers behind kelvin who is looking at gibarians body
it is there alone on its slab even the young girl is not with him
he gives rheya some pills to take
she just looks at them
are you going to take them
she nods and takes them
whats happening to us
its all right
please dont lie
i told you before i dont know how i came to be here
whatever you think you cant say to me i need to hear you say it
i love you
im the one at risk here
if were playing out what happened before i wont survive
he goes to her
that wont happen again
how can i tell
youve seen both of me
i only know what youre like here
youre all i know
there is no you from before
she sits frustrated
how could it be so cruel
how could it torture us like this
i dont think it knows its torturing us
its just watching
kelvin and rheya in bed
she looks despondent
kelvin is asleep
after a long period of silence we hear the faint sound of an instrument of some sort hitting the ground
after another beat kelvin awakens
he notices that he is alone and something tells him thats not a good sign
rheya is on the ground convulsing
beside her is a small steel drum which is spilling a strange looking liquid that solidifies and vaporizes with a smoky hiss
kelvin moves to rheya and is startled to see that half of her face and throat are burned away not melted as in a fire but merely eaten cleanly away
he picks her up
kelvin is carrying rheya
snow sticks his head out of a passing room
she drank liquid oxygen
kelvin puts rheya on the bed
her face and throat have returned to normal but she is not breathing
kelvin goes and puts his head to her chest but doesnt hear what he hoped to hear
he stands still looking at her
snow seems very detached
an uncomfortably long moment as we realize she is actually not going to wake up
snow says nothing
then her finger twitches
barely noticeable at first but growing in intensity
kelvin sees it and goes to her
she is starting to shake a little as though cold
shell come back dont worry
but then what
my theory is she can only live here that she will die if she leaves this ship
kelvin is still looking at rheya who is shaking a little harder its feeling like a seizure now
why do you think she hasnt suggested that
its the most obvious solution escape
she knows she cant leave here get out oh this one you love
what about the first one the one you fucked and then put into a rocket and blasted into space
you didnt love her
rheya is shaking much harder now kelvin tries to hold her still but shes too strong
he stands reluctantly and watches her
what happens if she comes back
is that polygamy
and even if you could take her home how would you get her through
you think theyre not going to notice her
rheya is shaking violently now as if a rippling rhythmic force were coursing through her
snow as he looks dispassionately on the two of them i never get used to them these
rheya continues her process of waking up its violent even sexual
she spasms to a peak of some sort and then slowly returns to normal
kelvin puts his hand on her forehead
she gradually begins to open her eyes
she looks at kelvin
it takes her a moment to realize she shouldnt be seeing him she shouldnt be seeing anything
she should be dead
she begins to cry
what am i
why cant i die
she turns away
im not rheya
youre always known that
rheya dont call me that
he turns her over
listen i dont care about anything but the fact that you are here
you are her you are rheya
im not human
rheya i am not going back
im staying here with you
then youll die
i want every second i can get with you
what will i do if you die
he doesnt know
kelvin and rheya in bed
do you think i can get pregnant here
a long beat
well know soon enough
the first time kelvin and rheya spoke at the party ten years ago
again we see her whisper in kelvins ear but this time we hear what she is saying i cant be a mother
she pulls back
thats good to know
kelvin as he packs to leave rheya
dont do this
i am literally begging you not to do this
you should have told me
it wouldnt have made any difference
chris i had to
i had to
i didnt think youd react like this
neither did i
you never said you wanted one
i never said i didnt
chris i cant stay here
chris im serious
i wont make it
then you wont make it
he leaves brushing past her
rheya unconscious on the kitchen floor
a long held shot of rheya crying
she is curled up retreating into herself
kelvin is trying to console her
i came back
you have to know that
i came back that night
rheya on the kitchen floor the note in her hand
kelvin is kneeling over her
kelvin and rheya
she is sobbing but somewhat calmer
i couldnt make it either
beat im so sorry
as we saw him before sitting in the chair
but we didnt hear him say this before if they succeed youll never see her again
in the immediate aftermath of her suicide attempt with the liquid oxygen youre afraid of me
i cant do this anymore
i still dont understand
its not possible
he tries to console her but she recoils
dont rheya as kelvin brushes past her on his way out
she looks desperate
rheya and kelvin
what do i have to do to stop it
i want you here
you exist here
i keep telling you
im not rheya
who are you then
i am rheya
but i am not the woman you loved ten years ago
yes you are did you hear what gibarian said
im not a human being
im an instrument
i came from your memory and your imagination and i will torture you no matter what
even if i remain passive
thats when i drank the
beat i was going mad
it felt like there was no body underneath my skin
there was something else
but i could feel my heart beating and i remembered you tested my blood
is it like yours
i told you
it was exactly like mine
but then i would be dead now
is that really what you want
i want to stop taking those pills
i wish you wouldnt
they do something to me
its hard to think straight
i think they help
i have consciousness but i am not mortal
dont you see why im going crazy
you have to remember that i love you thats all that matters i cant it put you here
ill admit it it acted like a god and put you here put you into my consciousness
i was asleep and it put you into my dream
i saw your mouth
and there you were
beat whether youve been sent here to make me happy or punish me it doesnt matter
the decision we make now is all that matters
stay with me
am i really her
i dont know anymore
all i see is you
stay with me
beat stay with me
kelvin is asleep
rheya is next to him
kelvin is on the videophone to snow
she knows everything
she knows who she is
she knows everything
does she know she came once before and you put her in no
what do you want
i want you to get sartorius to abandon his plan
feigning innocence what plan
just get him to stop
what do you want to do leave the station with her
kelvin shell disintegrate
you dont believe me
lets radio that shuttle pod you launched better yet lets go get it
ive charted its trajectory only take a few hours
her oxygen would have run out
maybe she doesnt need any
should we check
kelvin just stares at him
who are you trying to please
which her this one or that one
can you face both
we are in a situation that is beyond morality
so leave with her
youll see the transformation
youll see her die thats all
theyre mortal despite what she told you
she will die
then what will you do
i love her
you do you dont
shes willing to give her life youre willing to give yours its touching and magnificent anything you want but this isnt the place for it
dont you see
no you dont
he is playing back a message sent by sartorius
im sending you a message because i feel sorry for you
i really do kelvin
beat it is a mistake to become emotionally engaged with one of them
you are being manipulated
you are going around in circles to satisfy the curiosity of a power we dont understand and cant control and she is the living proof that power exists
if she were ugly you wouldnt want her around thats why shes not ugly
she is a mirror that reflects part of your mind
you provide the formula
you can only finish where you started remember that
beat they sold us out to the highest bidder
they had no right to do that
we should have been consulted
were not fucking hardware
kelvin wakes up
rheya is beside him
he rises and heads for the bathroom
he swallows two pills and a small cup of water
when he returns to the bed rheya is looking at him
what are you taking
a sleeping pill
do you want yours
rheya on the kitchen floor
the bottle of sleeping pills just beyond her hand
kelvin looks at rheya
she shakes her head she doesnt want the pills
kelvin comes and sits beside her
what does it want
i dont know
she goes to a portal and stares out at solaris
it created me and yet i cant communicate with it
it must hear me though
it must know whats happening to me
dont you think
snow on the videophone to kelvin
rheya is asleep in the background
i dont think it dislikes us
i think it just noticed us
it lives thinks and acts
we are dealing with a living creature here no question
and its done something weve never been able to do create a perfect human body
perfect except for the subatomic alterations but
on his suicide tape if solaris is inside our brain and it knows everything and were only consciously aware of what of our brain is up to at any given
moment it knows us better than we know ourselves
its not even close
rheya and kelvin
ive decided that if it is god its a sick god
its ambitions exceed its powers but it doesnt realize it
beat its created a situation without a goal and i hate that
a god whose passion is not a redemption who saves nothing fulfills no purpose
beat and us
we would have to have an arrangement
an unspoken understanding that i am not human
how can i not hate something that does that
kelvin is asleep
rheya is crying beside him
kelvin asleep alone
rheya is in the corridor talking to someone
rheya is beside him asleep
kelvin in a fever eyes open but glazed
rheya is putting a compress on his forehead
of the room
his labrador from the opening sequence is sitting by the chair
kelvin sits in a chair looking at sitting in the same position as it was on the prometheus
breathes a sigh of relief at being home
everything seems slowed down somehow
i though i was home
on the prometheus
kelvin is in bed feverish
i thought it was over
he sees rheya in the hallway again talking to someone we cant see
wakes up again
rheya is asleep beside him
rheya the first day she and kelvin saw each other
ten years ago
kelvin and rheya standing on a street corner
they seem to be pausing in the midst of a very serious conversation
it is raining
kelvin in bed on the prometheus
rheya is mopping his brow
kelvin in bed feverish
rheya is there wiping his forehead
on the prometheus
kelvin looks over to rheya
where did you go before
you were talking to someone in the corridor
you must have been dreaming
she begins to cry
whats the matter
she just shakes her head
from kelvins point of view rheya in the chair crying
then he looks right to see rheya in the doorway talking to someone we cannot see
then he looks further to the right and there she is again staring at him from the bathroom doorway
she moves to the edge of the bed in order to be near
im losing my mind
beat im breaking apart
kelvin sits in his chair as he did at the beginning with the three officials from dba behind him
only now the three officials are snow sartorius and gibarian
is this what it means to die
beat am i in the moment of my own death
beat is this the last thought i will ever have
this idea forces him to rise and he does slowly
behind kelvin as he somehow keeps moving
we hold a long time and then count to ten
then kelvin moving down a crowded sidewalk in slow motion
i am home now
beat i try to find the rhythm of the world where i used to live
but i feel completely and continually out of sync
i am separate
why did i return to earth and lie about what happened
lie about having contact with something like solaris
i knew something else was out there and didnt tell a soul
i left them in the dark
we all did
kelvin traveling home from the city
he stops and looks around before entering his front door
so why come back at all
to see if she comes here
of the woods
but there are strange incongruities in the image pieces of the prometheus breaking through for instance a few of the automated taskmasters are crawling along the ground
looking from the doorway notes this
he doesnt seem surprised though
i dont believe it will happen
kelvin in his bed awake
but i will wait anyway
count to five
then kelvin is in his bed still feverish
i thought it was over
he looks around the room
he is alone
a flashing light on his computer demands attention
a video message from rheya
dont blame them
i begged them to do it
its better this way
beat im sorry
beat im sorry i tried to make you think i was human
beat i read my own suicide note
i found it in your things
i realized i was not her
she looks away
i know that you loved me chris
i know that
beat i love you
kelvin breaks down
kelvin with the dead rheya in his arms crying
beyond him is the rain streaked window
on the floor by her hand is the note
on it is scrawled the end of a dylan thomas poem the one kelvin quoted to her the first time they spoke
the first night
again kelvin leans into rheyas ear and whispers
this time we hear what he says though they go mad they shall be sane
though they sink through the sea they shall rise again
kevin holding rheya
the note on the floor
the rain streaked window
though lovers be lost love shall not
and death shall have no dominion
kelvin wipes the hair from her face
you killed her
kelvin furious is talking through a slit in sartorius door
you murdered her
kelvin she begged me
i had a short range version of the destabilizer prototype a miniature with a range of a few meters
she walked into it and disappeared
she was gone
kelvin looks around
shell come back
no she wont
why would you let her to do that
its not human kelvin
whatever it is its not human and i am threatened by that
evolution of the species at stake threatened
and i want to win
i want humans to win
so i am killing it before it kills me
you fucking bastard
whose side are you on
kelvin moves away
still turning slowly
but something about its appearance is different
kelvin is chasing sartorius to the flight deck
yelling as he runs its changing characteristics
its solidifying taking on weight
if it continues it will implode from its own weight and turn into a black hole in about four hours and pulls us in with it
kelvin and sartorius get the ship ready for take off
did you call him
kelvin turns and sees one of the video monitors that snow is sitting in his room
via intercom snow
we need you up here
snow doesnt reply
snow looks up
theres a strange look on his face
whats wrong with you
we need your help
i wont be making the trip
snow get up here now
im not snow
this stops kelvin and sartorius
they look at each other and then at the monitor
i got rid of him
i wanted to see if
i wanted to be the only one
i wanted to be snow
i knew it
when did this happen
oh right away
thats why you never saw me with anyone
you shouldve noticed that
i miss him though
i think i made a mistake
but i cant leave with you
i wont make it
maybe you can
you want it coming back with us
you go ahead
of what i remember about earth
its all one thing now
everythings a blur
i like distinctions
snow lies down on his bed
kelvin looks at sartorius
we do not have time to deal with this
get the diode sail into position and let me know when the bias drive and the induction ring are at zero point
kelvin nods and obeys
he then takes one last look at the monitor to see snow lying in bed
kelvin reaches over and shuts the monitor off
the prometheus moves away from solaris
after the ship has gone
a soft black spot begins to form in the center of the planet
slowly inexorably this black spot begins to expand
within a minute solaris has disappeared
kelvin back on earth
silent and still
and the rain continues
he watches the activity the cars buses and people moving to and fro
beat what did that word mean to me
beat i have returned
kelvin begins to walk
i work in the city now
after work i wander and lose myself
i am silent and attentive
i follow the current
i make a conscious effort to smile nod stand and perform the millions of gestures that constitute life on earth
kelvin taking the train to the suburbs
i will study these gestures until they become reflexes again
i will find new interests and occupations but kelvin makes his way toward his cabin
as he nears his labrodor recognizes him and approaches
kelvin pats the dogs coat
i will not
i will not give myself to anything or anyone because i am haunted by the idea that i remembered her wrong
that i shaded my memory of her to suit myself
that i was unfair to her and caused her destruction
what if i was wrong about everything
beat ive come to believe that memory is a curse
kelvin is near the front door dog at his heel
he looks in as he brings his key to the lock and his face freezes
is in the living room waiting for him
she is sitting on the sofa looking toward the other side of the room
sensing someone she turns to see kelvin and her face melts into a smile
opens the door
he cannot speak
rises and moves toward him
he breathes her in
she squeezes him
after a long beat how can you be here
just stay with me
beat stay with me
everything is forgiven
she sways with him gently
his body relaxes
i love you
a tableau of the cabin
the dog is on the front step seemingly content despite the light rain
as fog drifts in we rise and soon the mist has nearly obscured the house
the fog turns into clouds and we get fleeting glimpses of the cabin as we move farther and farther away
we stay in a translucent white stage for a few moments until gradually the edges of a circle become apparent in the corners of the frame
still there is a light rain sound
these dark rounded edges penetrate further until they are forming the shape of a circle
the misty consistency begins to gain some color and body
and we realize we are now looking at the surface of solaris
