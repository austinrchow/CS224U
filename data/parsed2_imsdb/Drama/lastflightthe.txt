written by john monk saunders on a freeze frame of a huge mortar on the edge of a dismal no mans land surrounded by trees and overhanging branches
the distant roar of battle rumbles ominously
superimposed titles appear and hold for a moment
abruptly the image springs to life
the gun fires deafeningly
the nearby branches shake violently
another set of titles appears
the image freezes again as a lone bugle plays a charge
again and again and again the image moves the gun discharges noisily the image freezes and more sets of titles appear with every firing
on the last discharge the trumpet fades and all hell breaks loose nothing but fast brutal flash cuts of cannon firing in all directions
massive explosions on the battlefield that light up the night
troops marching across a bridge as a shell hits the river below sending water towering into the sky
an entire cavalry division galloping hard over the battlefield blazing mortar fire visible above them on the horizon
brief shots of the horses their grim riders hanging on for dear life their muscles flexing hooves pounding the dirt
mortar fire explosions smoke
a machine gunner fires
a soldier falls
infantrymen rifles in hand press through the haze
more machine gunning
more soldiers go down
a massive gun fires
smash cut of a tank tread bearing down on the camera blacking out the screen
infantrymen trail behind the heavy machinery firing pistols rifles
a bridge explodes
a building explodes
the ground explodes
a bomb drops from an airplane
aerial view of an exploding building
anti aircraft guns at work
planes in the air
a machine gun fires skyward
planes circle filling the air
a single bi plane
the planes gunner shep lambert looks down surveys the situation breaks into a grin
shep nudges his pilot cary lockwood and points
cary looks down to see another plane below
in it pilot bill talbot waves and salutes
francis the gunner opens his mouth smiles and nods up at them
an enemy plane arrives
the enemy pilot fires his twin machine guns
bill and francis plane spins away
bill cocks a snook at the enemy plane and waves dismissively at it much to francis amusement
the planes circle in the air
the enemy plane trails shep and cary
shep fires his machine gun to no avail as cary watches
the enemy pilot returns fire
the two planes tango in mid air
the enemy pilot grins and fires
bullet holes riddle the side of shep and carys plane
cary warns shep theyve been hit
from the enemy planes pov shep and carys plane streams black smoke
the two planes
shep and carys plane goes into a steep dive spinning out of control
cary rips off his goggles as smoke pours up from below him
flames fill the cockpit as carys gloved hands desperately try to keep hold of the red hot controls
the plane streaming smoke spins wildly downward
shep surrounded with smoke looks skyward and salutes with mock gallantry
above bill and francis watch
bill returns the salute with a smile and waves
francis though doesnt look happy
shep twists in his seat and looks around
carys hands grasp the controls in the flaming cockpit
level off cary
despite the flames cary pulls back on the control stick
from the planes pov the landscape rushes by
the plane now level crashes into the ground and comes to an abrupt stop
cary jumps out of the cockpit and rushes back to shep who is struggling to clamber out
shep are you all right
cant make it cary
cant make it
here give me your arm
ill get you out of here
hang on there shep
get a hold just hold tight old fella
cary pulls shep out and hauls him away from the burning wreckage where the two of them collapse to the ground half conscious
flames consume the plane
for lieutenant shep lambert a patient at u
sheps temperature readings for october th to october th are indicated by a line on a graph near a level marked critical
the distant sound of battle continues to rumble
swings into view
this one is for lieutenant cary lockwood whose readings for october th to november nd are also below the critical mark
the line continues and improves considerably by november th when the final reading is marked normal
the battle sounds are now joined by a loudly ticking clock
with no sign of energy or emotion shep and cary sit together on a hospital cot in full uniform
shep wears dark eyeglasses
cary has a coat draped over his hands
he glances off
we follow his gaze panning past other patients in the hospital to a wall clock and calendar
it is november th and the time is almost eleven a
the battles rumble drones on
stare up at the clock
behind his dark glasses sheps left eye twitches
slowly dissolves to one last brief battle montage soldiers yelling and running guns firing noisily a plane crashing explosions
the final image is of a plane parked on the ground its engine dying its propeller slowing to a stop as we dissolve back to the clock face
the center of the clock is lined up exactly with the center of the propeller the slowing propeller blades are replaced by the clocks hands as if to symbolically suggest
that the war has ended but time goes on
the noise of battle fades and only the ticking of the clock remains
dissolve to the calendar november th armistice day
sit motionless side by side on the cot
shep has a hand over his left eye
well the old guerre is finie
what are ya gonna do now shep
turns to him and then what
shep lets go of his eye and looks at cary as if the answer were obvious
cary grins wryly
a nurse opens a door for shep and cary who enter
shep wears his dark glasses
cary carries his coat to hide his hands
they pause as the doors they have passed through close behind them
their distinguished looking doctor a medical officer with a white gown over his uniform sits at his desk studying their papers
lieutenants lambert and lockwood
rises joins them you two leaving us eh
in a way im sorry to release you two
i have no choice in the matter
shep removes his glasses and presses his hand to his eye
what am i going to do major about my oh this rotten business
the doctor examines sheps eye more closely
spasmodic twitching of the muscles under the eye eh lieutenant
what the french call a tic
t i c tic
little bothersome isnt it
shep puts his glasses back on
im afraid timell have to take care of that
time and normal living
sheps lips tighten skeptically
you two are returning to the united states i presume
shep glances at cary
ah we havent decided
id take the first boat home
well here you go
the doctor gives shep his release form and shakes his hand then turns to shake carys
cary merely looks down darkly and raises a bandaged hand at him
oh i forgot your burnt hands
the doctor folds up the release and stuffs it in carys breast pocket
neither of you is fully hospitalized
id undertake a systematic course of finger exercises to uh stretch them and loosen them up
in time youll regain their full use
thank you sir
the doctor gives cary a pat on the shoulder
cary manages a smile and salutes
shep moves to the door saluting the doctor
shep opens the door and he and cary head out
after the door closes the doctor rubs his head thoughtfully
he talks apparently to an offscreen aide
well there they go
out to face life
shakes his head and their whole training was in preparation for death
he moves off as we shep and cary exit the building but pause outside the doorway
theyve seen something coming toward them and glance at one another before clearing out of its path
they watch glumly as a small group of wounded soldiers enter through some metal gates walk slowly past shep and cary without acknowledgment and head into the hospital
the office window opens
the doctor no longer in white but wearing his uniform and his aide take a break standing in the window frame for a little fresh air
the doctor smokes a cigarette as they discuss shep and cary
why cant they go on with flying
you know the air mails or something
im afraid theyre unfit for further service in that direction
the aide looks at him quizzically
they fell you know six thousand meters
shakes his head sadly like dropping a fine swiss watch on the pavement
shattered both of them
their nervous systems are deranged disorganized brittle
nods theyre like projectiles shaped for war and hurled at the enemy
gestures with cigarette theyve described a beautiful high arching trajectory
and now theyve fallen back to earth
we slowly pull back from the two men
oh well if they take care of themselves theyll pull through all right
even if they do take care of themselves what good are they
what can you expect of them
shakes his head i hate to think what may become of them
we have pulled back far enough and now we two uniformed men with familiar faces exuberant pilot bill and reserved gunner francis arrive at the bottom of the stairs in
front of the hospital
bill with his arm in a sling and francis using a cane start up the stairs and wave
texas accent hello cary
at the top of the stairs shep and cary wave back pleased to see them
unexpectedly shep and cary hurry down the stairs past them
friendly well i see you got yours
bill and francis watch surprised as shep and cary hurry off
calls down puzzled hey
where you going
shep and cary already seated in the back of a waiting automobile grin like kids
from the stairs francis smokes a cigarette and looks down at shep and cary uncertainly
but bill takes the news in stride he smiles and waves his hat at them
see you in paris
waves his cigarette yeah
smiling shep and cary wave back as their car drives off
a superimposed text reads traffic noise taxi horns squeaking
strolling down the sidewalk four abreast as if they own the town come our heroes bill shep francis and cary in smart hats and dinner clothes
outwardly they seem to have recovered from their wounds
but shep still wears his dark glasses and we occasionally glimpse his eye twitching
carys bandages are gone but he has not regained full use of his hands
his personality is dark and dry more subdued than sheps and he comes across as the most levelheaded rational member of the group its unacknowledged leader
francis seems to have suffered the greatest toll psychologically
a narcoleptic strangely detached and unemotional much of the time always on the verge of dozing off his speech slurs even when he isnt drunk
only the athlete of the group bill a burly texan whose full name is william talbot is in outstanding physical shape
but he is reckless restless and temperamental covering up unnamed insecurities with bravado and forced exuberance
how bout a cocktail
not a bad idea at that
as a group they turn and head into a nearby building
made of light bulbs outside the building
it spells out claridges a popular parisian drinking establishment for anglo americans
numerous shelves holding numerous bottles of liquor
employees in white jackets hurriedly rush in and pull down a few bottles
the place is packed with well dressed men and women
the bar is crowded with men and men only for no women are allowed to sit at claridges bar smoking drinking conversing
at the end of the pan we discover our heroes entering greeted by an employee who takes their hats
an attractive young woman with a wide vacant stare stands against a wall opposite the bar holding a champagne glass in her hands
her name is nikki and she seems to be in a world all to herself
our four handsome heroes file past her intent on finding a table
only cary pays any attention to nikki
after they have all passed her he pauses to turn and stare
shes extremely nearsighted and doesnt notice him
he looks at the glass in her hand puzzled
he starts off but then pauses
after a second uncertain look he moves off to join his friends who stand together and peer around the crowded room unable to find a place to sit
cary keeps looking at nikki
he glances at the others and they follow his gaze still wearing a blank expression clutches the glass in two hands
in her hands
between her fingers we glimpse its contents a complete set of mens false teeth
we pull back to discover that cary has approached her
hes standing right next to her and is staring at the glass
she finally notices him
i beg your pardon
but if im not too inquisitive would you mind telling me what is that youre drinking
after another look cary turns to his friends
hey its teeth
shep bill and francis hurry over like children and crowd around to stare in amazement at the teeth
nikki is unimpressed by all the attention
its a full set upper and lower
to nikki its a nice expression
hey how come youre with those teeth
i was just standing here
and a nice gentleman came along and begged my pardon and asked would i mind holding his teeth for a minute
well what did he want you to hold his teeth for
said he wanted to biff somebody
excited biff somebody
which way did he go
just around to the right
come on men
were liable to see a fight
as quickly as they arrived shep bill and francis depart
cary starts after them but stops to politely address nikki who has gone back into her trance
would you like to come along
as if it were obvious oh no
i have to stay here and mind the mans teeth
they glance down at the teeth
oh of course
cary hurries off as nikkis empty eyes rise to the ceiling
as it takes a combination one two punch from a pair of fists
dropping unconscious to the floor
enter a hallway just in time to see two claridges employees reach down and haul away the unconscious body
our heroes have missed the fight but shep and bill are delighted anyway
bill brushes his hands one of his favorite gestures with satisfaction as if he had thrown the punches himself well
thats all fixed
bill straightens his bow tie
already the group seeks a new distraction
lets go back
they head back to the bar
nikki no longer standing against the wall sits on a bar stool with her back to the countertop smoking a cigarette and holding an empty champagne glass
our heroes enter and glancing at the wall fail to see her
after a moment of searching cary spots her at the bar
oh there she is
all four crowd around her pleased to be in her company
well we missed it
did something happen
well they carried a guy out
sees her empty glass say
whats become of the teeth
oh the man came and got his teeth
well what did he say
he said thank you for holding his teeth
what did he look like
i think he fell in an airplane in the war and got his teeth knocked out
well why do you think he was in the war
oh he had a kind of little striped ribbon in his buttonhole
what makes you think he was a flyer
dry to the others you can tell a flyer better by his ears
the men chuckle
well what do you say we have a drink
sure heres some space
seats have opened up at the bar so they grab stools next to nikki
shep greets the bartender hello jean
bon soir monsieur lambert
quest ce que voulez vous
could i have a champagne cocktail
calls off quatre martinis pour messieurs
champagne cocktail pour mademoiselle nikki
the men are all excited to find out her name
francis uses a pretzel as a monocle to eye nikki
for the first time this evening shep takes off his dark glasses
can you imagine that fellas
her name is nikki
considers the situation her name is nikki
she holds mens teeth
she sits at the bar and she drinks champagne
significantly boys shes gonna be a lot of trouble
drinks are served
a moment of silence as they imbibe
nikkis hand shakes as she lifts her glass spilling some champagne
she laughs embarrassed
oh my my
shep who has been watching her closely also laughs
she cant even hold her glass
nikki notices cary unsteadily using both his hands to hold his martini
casually oh well he cant either
besides he has to use two hands
a dark look crosses carys face as he looks at her and puts down his drink
seeing this bill and francis exchange worried glances
cary abruptly rises and leaves the bar
mystified nikki looks quizzically at shep who is suddenly grim and annoyed
course he cant hold his glass
his hands are burned
you have no right to spill your drinks
he cant help himself
he brought a plane down on fire
in the war
shep demonstrates with his hands as he explains he held the stick
but his hands began to slip
then he held it inside his arms
he was trying to bring his rear gunner down alive
did he bring him down safe
shep takes a swallow of his martini sets down the glass
brought him down
oh so thats why
thats why he cant hold a glass
oh im so ashamed
now carys had a pretty thin time
his nerves are tricky
you should never call attention to his hands
cary sits with a fresh drink and is trying awkwardly to pick it up when a handsome but humorless american journalist the unspeakable frink enters and greets him casually
unhappily oh hello frink
cary immediately turns his attention to a menu
rebuffed frink wanders over to the bar and sees the other men
he has a friendly pat on the back for francis and bill
frink pauses to stare at nikkis back astonished to find a woman sitting at the bar
then he turns to shep amused
say dont you know any other opening remarks
its about all weve heard from you for a year
signals the bartender hi
frink snaps his fingers at jean and grabs a seat next to shep
jean asks for frinks order in french
jean moves off
frink regards the others
say why dont you fellows go home and go to work
what kind of work
oh anything useful
what could we do
sell washing machines
drive a milk wagon
mend old furniture or somethin
go back to flying
fly the air mails
aw we couldnt fly a kite
maybe a small kite
francis holds his fingers to indicate a very small kite
well there must be something you can do
weve got to tend to our drinking
we dont get much opportunity
lots of things going on outside
sun shining trees growing people walking around
is that still going on
laughs sounds pretty pre war to me
during all this nikki has been in her own little world
frink leans over and whispers to shep
dont i rate an introduction
whos your swell friend
just an old hussy we found scattered around
around her neck on a slender chain nikki carries a small lorgnette
it opens with a spring and has small rectangular lenses
she uses it frequently peering at unfamiliar objects in her helpless nearsighted way
on sheps remark she whips it out to stare at him mildly offended
he raises his drink to his lips and turns to her speaking out of the side of his mouth off frink pay no attention
sometimes he goes away
nikki looks away glumly as shep grins at her
she turns and sees something
she raises her lorgnette for a better look at who sits at his table staring into space holding his unread menu in his lap
is pleased to see cary
he didnt go
she rises to join him
startled rises and stares at nikki as she approaches
oh im so sorry
she tries to take his hands but he pulls them away in horror and stuffs them in his pockets
oh your poor hands
your poor poor hands
wildly uncomfortable cary glances around like a cornered animal and finally stalks away without a word hands still stuffed in his pockets
stunned nikki watches him exit the building
she realizes shes done something terribly wrong and moves to follow him
but shep intercepts her
upset she whimpers
more in disbelief than anger if you arent the worst
first you insult his hands and make him mad
then you cry over them and make him self conscious
come on back here
he clasps her hand and leads her to francis and bill watch disturbed as shep guides a crying nikki onto a stool beside them
shep sits next to her as she continues to sob
she pulls out a compact to fix her tear stained face
well thats torn it
hell never come back now
then well have to find him
to explain how sorry i am
amused at her distress we ell
you dont have to get so emotional about it
whos getting emotional
youre coming all apart
hands her a glass here
take a drink of this
make you laugh and play
nikki takes a sip then busies herself with putting away her compact
meanwhile bill leans in
to shep say whats she crying about
shes crying on account of they didnt wash her strawberries this morning
to nikki didnt they wash your strawberries this morning
well there aint a whole hell of a lot that we can do about that now
agrees sadly no
frink watches suspiciously as shep pays the tab rises and whispers to nikki
nikki obediently hops off her stool and shep leads her away from the bar toward the exit
bill and frink are distressed to see her go
bill calls after shep hey
wherere you goin
rises out where
out to get a drink
bill gestures grandly toward the bar with its many shelves of liquor bottles
dont you suppose you could arrange that here
we gotta go somewheres else
without missing a beat okay
come on francis
we got to go somewheres else to get a drink
francis and bill head out the door
after a moment frink follows behind
a taxi cab filled with bill francis shep nikki and frink pulls up to a restaurant
as it stops bill rises and points to someone at a sidewalk table
there he is
the others look
the group cheers spills out of the taxi and heads for where cary sits reading a newspaper
cary looks up
he rises a little startled and politely removes his hat
the others crowd around him
say what are you tryin to do disown us
genuinely polite hello
wont you sit down
sure well sit down
whatd ya think wed do
they all take seats around the little table
during this frink brings a chair for nikki who grabs a seat of her own
when he tries to use it to sit next to her bill commandeers it for himself
with a wave to frink thank you
a waiter joins them as they settle in
what will you have to drink
uh could i have champagne please
the waiter departs
off her order bill gives nikki a look
boys shes goin to be a problem
explains to bill thats what i started on
to cary it upsets me if i change over to anything else
to bill theres a lot of things wrong with this one
to nikki what were you doing at the bar at claridges anyway
dont you know youre not supposed to be there
theres a sign on the wall says ladies must sit at the back
cant read signs
well well just have to take care of her thats all
do you think shes good lookin enough
oh i know im not very good looking but but what
but when i was a little girl my mother always said i had the nicest hair ribbon
shep laughs derisively
the others give him a look and he shuts up
the drinks arrive
all the men save cary snatch up their glasses
bill removes the toothpicked olive and swallows his martini whole
he watches nikki rubbing her champagnes drinking straw between her hands as if she were a boy scout trying to start a fire
then theres her drinking
whats the matter with my drinking
youre a sissy drinker
well maybe i can improve
meanwhile cary attempts with some success to drink his martini with one unsteady hand
bill inspects nikkis mouth
then theres her teeth
why one of em is turned sideways
points you mean this one
why dont you have it turned around
i dont have it turned around on account of its a kind of help
well in what respect does it kind of help
well you see when anyone kisses me too hard it splits my lip
and you could tell when anyone kissed me too hard on account of my lip would bleed
so now i dont let anyone kiss me hard
the men are amused
nikki sips her champagne
well well let that pass
shep abruptly rises and walks off presumably to the rest room
wheres he gone
shep went off to sharpen his skates
now about your nose
what about my nose
it isnt straight
it kind of turns up at the end
well when i was a little girl i got bumped by a swing
howd you happen to get bumped
i just walked through the gate
i was only seven
oh poor dear
didnt you see it
i cant see very far
did it hurt
it made me dizzy all day
well i guess we cant hold that against her
we all make mistakes
michelangelo painted adam with a navel
bill and nikki laugh at this
suddenly nikki grows thoughtful
all the same hed look funny the other way even in a painting
they all consider this for a moment as a fresh round of drinks arrives
frink abruptly rises and walks off presumably to the rest room
wheres he gone
he went off to shave a horse
have you got a husband or anything
but we havent met in quite a long time
why not in a long time
well on account of my mothers name was beulah
now you cant have a mother named beulah
so i changed it to jane
and thats how it all began
an odd chiming sound distracts them
they look off to see the narcoleptic arms folded asleep in his chair
he awakes with a frown pulls a pocket watch from inside his jacket opens it and looks at it
the chiming ends and he rises without a word and exits
nikki watches francis exit curiously
bill waves her off before she can ask hes goin off to tame an alligator
who is he anyway
francis used to fly with us in the th
the best shot in the squadron
brought down twelve planes
used to call him sudden death
he lost interest after his teammate got killed
hes lonesome is all
i like him
he carries a chiming watch on account of hes always falling asleep in the daytime
what kind of chimes
oh westminster canterbury and whittington
ill take vanilla
cary puts a fist on his hip and gives nikki an exasperated look
taxi horns squeak
francis shep and frink return from their various adventures and sit down as bill gives nikki his opinion of francis
i think hes a washout
well just because youre a big bombardier and an all american interrupts all american what
oh montana state or somewhere
idaho or nebraska or the carlisle indians or something
didnt you never read about bill
bronko bill the alabama flash
bill grins as nikki inspects him closely through her lorgnette
skeptical i think its a forgery
bills face falls
he looks at nikki
what do you want me to do
tackle a horse
shep is amused
tackle a horse
with a dismissive wave all right all right ill tackle a horse
shep looks down the street
here comes one now
they all look to see rolling down the street in their direction
everyone watches as bill rises and suddenly bolts in the direction of the cab
look out horse
rolling along as bill runs in and tackles the horse locking his big arms around the animals front legs to trip up the poor creature
cary horrified stands and yells hey bill
come back here
cary runs off toward bill leaving a thrilled shep and a worried francis with a distressed nikki
they all stare in concerned amazement as a crowd of pedestrians stops to watch the excitement
distraught oh bill
cary rushes up to the startled cab driver who is pulling hard on the reins
whats the idea runnin down my friend like that
cary forces a wad of francs into the drivers hand
the cabman protests in french but takes the cash
of the fallen horse as the driver descends from the cab
standing up now bill tries to haul the horse to its feet while cary tries to placate the driver
look where youre going in the future now
you just watch out where youre going
bill grabs the horse by its bridle and tries to pull it up
the horse sorely annoyed gets up on its own and shakes its head violently to drive bill away
bill hangs on and tries to calm the horse
cary tries to pull bill away as frink francis and the driver gather around
bill is more interested in petting the horse which understandably shies away from him
admonishes bill now listen come on out here you old fool
to the shying horse whoa whoa
to bill now listen you ought to be ashamed of yourself
you old fool
you know what youll do
youll kill yourself one of these days
now come on get out of here
now listen satisfied with the outcome of all this bill heads back for the sidewalk
to the driver you all right now brother
the driver nods but is more concerned with reining in his skittish horse
now you just keep your horse see
you got your money
the cabbie salutes cary but pays more attention to his horse
the waiter sets out a fresh round of drinks as the group returns
bill happily dusts off the sleeve of his dinner jacket
cary beside him leads him to his seat
they all sit down under the following hey listen bill youre all american see
youre two all americans
the ladys convinced youre the whole team
you dont have to tackle any more horses
how bout that
drink your drink
pleased with himself ahhh
wasnt that a great spill
nikki abruptly rises
where are you going
would you all excuse me for a moment
well where are you going
a grave announcement to take a chinese singing lesson
francis immediately understands that shes become one of them
he raises an olive in the air and cheers hooray
the men rise and all but frink cheer her lustily as she departs hooray
walks proudly into the restaurant as the men cheer
a smiling maitre d directs her to the ladies room
frink watches nikki disappear from view and after a glance at the others rises and follows her
shep bill and cary remain at the table laughing and drinking
bill turns to cary with a smile
what kind of a girl do you think nikki is
cary glances in nikkis direction and tells bill confidentially i think shes the kind that sits down on phonograph records
bill thinks about this and nods
as nikki returns from her chinese singing lesson frink puts his arm against a wall blocking her way
say nikki lets ditch these drunks and go off somewhere by ourselves
these crazy fools are liable to do anything
hopeful do you think so
since the war they dont care what happens
and do you
ill say so
ive got more important things to think of
what more important things
well my work
what kind of work
im the foreign correspondent for a new york newspaper syndicate
genuinely how nice for you
nikki pushes his arm away and heads for the table
frink watches her go a dark look on his face
the men rise briefly as nikki rejoins them and sits
are you the kind of girl that sits down on phonograph records
nikki lowers her eyes
a bit defensively people shouldnt leave their records lying about
to francis what did i tell you
abruptly brightens take me dancing
what place you wanna go
what places you got
well we got maxims only its too early
weve got florida perroquet pigalle le rat mort moulin rouge bal tabarin
ill take vanilla
cary gives her a look
bill clears his throat
somebody pay for the drinks
bill rises and claps his hands with enthusiasm
were off in a billizzard of horse radish
whatever that means
the men rise and retrieve their hats
a festive parisian night spot
dance music plays while a floor show lit by moving spotlights unfurls in the huge darkened ballroom which is ringed with crowded tables
a handsome male dancer in tuxedo and top hat whirls exuberantly around the floor surrounded by beautiful chorus girls
somewhere above all this nikki lit by spotlight flashes sits on the edge of a ringside balcony observing the show with eager interest through her lorgnette
the show continues after a few twirls the dancer links arms with the girls to form a line and do some precision high kicking
the music continues but the dance apparently ends and the lights come up
impressed nikki is breathless
isnt this nice
nearby the men sit at a roped off table for six on a low balcony
cary and francis sit glumly on one side of the table as bill tries to tell a story to the others frink a nameless young woman nicknamed kiss me quick
who appears in this scene only shep and nikki
now listen men
ill tell ya something funny
cary and francis look doubtful about this
bill sits at the table
i was only four years old once
to cary whatd he say
said he was only four years old once
and my aunt had a very low neck dress on
to cary whatd he say
said his aunt had on a very low neck dress
cant believe it
and she sat right across the table in front of me
and i said auntie i can see your knees
nobody laughs or even changes expression
pointedly after an awkward pause i wonder whats doing in portugal tonight
bill is disappointed at the response
maybe id better do my match trick
if you do match tricks ill recite
you write poetry
ill send you a photograph of my poetry
cary gives her a look then rises and peers with one eye into the open bottle of champagne on the table between him and nikki
he gestures at the bottle as he sits back down
say i wonder if theres anything intoxicating in that
everybody cracks up except nikki who looks a little hurt
an empty champagne bottle is placed on the floor
by now a dozen empty champagne bottles have been placed on the floor
strays to nikkis legs and up her dress
nikki rises indignantly and turns on frink
just what are your plans
the other men seated at the table understand instantly whats going on and stare darkly at frink
youll have to watch that lad nikki
hes a member of the wandering hands society and he has a groping good time
frink nervously adjusts his necktie
cary glares at him
your behavior sir is unseemly unethical indelicate and lousy
have i made myself clear
frink pretending chagrin looks at nikki
youll have to watch out for him nikki
hes just a licentious old man
its getting pretty late isnt it
do you want to go home nikki
rises ill take you home
where do you live
the others except for frink begin to rise too
shep pays the waiter
ill take her home too
so will i
well match to see who takes her home
well all take her home
i saw her first
it makes no difference
she belongs to us all now
nikki laughs as they all depart
frink rises wearily to follow them out
the group enters the spacious empty lobby laughing loudly
someone says wheeee
others say ssshhh
they cross to the front desk
the clerk is fast asleep his head down on the desk
nikki is about to wake him when bill bounds forward
quietly to nikki sh
let him sleep
whats your number
whispers eighty eight
bill waves the others on and they exit toward the elevators
once theyve gone bill the athlete vaults the front desk and lands with a little noise on the other side without waking the clerk
he cautiously checks the clerk to make sure the sleeping man hasnt awakened then fetches nikkis key from its cubbyhole
bill leaps up on top of the desk landing on his rear end swinging his legs around nearly kicking the clerk in the process then silently slides off the desk
to the floor
watching the sleeping clerk warily bill tiptoes away
at the last possible moment bill purposefully whacks the signal bell with his hand making it ring noisily
the clerk awakens with a start and grabs a nearby telephone just as bill disappears from view
amused the group piles into the ascenseur
last one in is bill who shuts the door and the metal safety gate behind him
here we are
whos gonna pilot this craft
ill take her off
wheres the throttle
bill looks for the controls as cary turns playfully to the others
got your safety belts buckled
bill finds the appropriate lever and grabs hold
here it is
bill pulls the lever and the car rockets up the shaft
most everybody cheers
they watch with great interest as the floors pass by rapidly
shut her off
hold her nose
shes headed for the hangar
nervous hey stop it will ya
weve gone an passed my floor
gone an passed your floor
ill fix that
bill brakes the car and starts it back down the shaft
put her tail down
bail out boys
shes gonna crash
nervous stop it
weve gone an passed my floor again
how do you stop this thing
bill brakes the car too quickly it slams to a halt and everyone loses their footing nearly falling down
part of the light fixture above them breaks loose and crashes down on frinks head much to everyones amusement they laugh as frink clutches his head annoyed
thats right laugh
we shouldve brought our parachutes
get a good hold millie
were off again
bill reaches for the controls but shep grabs the tail of bills jacket and pulls him away
let cary take the controls
youll run us through the roof
bill brushes his hands his pride a little hurt
all right all right
let her go
the car starts up the shaft again
there we are
the elevator door opens
cary leads the way as everyone else spills out happily into the hall
shep puts a congratulatory arm around cary
thats a pilot for ya
you deserve a medal
bill pins nikkis room key to carys vest pocket
smiling cary holds it up proudly to nikki
all right come on men
they head down the hallway in a drunken disorganized fashion
shep walks an imaginary tightrope wobbling spectacularly
cary bringing up the rear shuts the elevator door and escorts nikki
i need a rest i need a rest
francis drops into a handy chair and lights a cigarette but bill immediately hauls him up come on come on
bill whistling and pretending to ice skate leads the group down the hall
francis tries to enter a room but frink pulls him out of the doorway
bill backtracks to help frink escort francis
this allows cary and nikki to take the lead
nikki indicates the correct doorway to cary
here we are
the group cheers
cary unlocks the door
the group enters nikkis hotel room
laughing the group files into the darkened room and spreads out
nikki switches on the lights
bill marvels at the luxurious suite
well ill be a
nikkis got a whole apartment
and a gramophone
delighted shep starts to crank up the gramophone
and chairs and tables and floors and ceilings and everything
so this is where nikki lives
amused and pleased by their reaction nikki heads for her bedroom
yes this is where nikki lives
shep picks up a book and admires it grandly
and shes got a book
the gramophone comes to life and music plays from a record
nikki passes into the bedroom and switches on a light
got all the comforts of home
frink tries to follow nikki into the bedroom but bill pointedly intercepts him
disappointed frink looks past him into nikkis bedroom and bill follows his gaze to see on nikkis glass topped dressing table dozens of them
look at all the bottles
bill enters and inspects the table closely
as the other four men respond to bills enthusiastic summons and enter
come on in and look at nikkis bottles
cary joins bill at the table as the texan picks up one of the bottles and reads the label
hey dont be handlin her things
put em down
but bill goes right on delighted
the others crowd around the table
leave em alone
reve de vestale
hey you big bombardier chiki chiki
during this francis has casually inspected a curtained walk in closet near the table
he pulls the curtain to reveal a rack of carefully hung dresses and a floor covered with dozens of shoes organized in impeccably straight lines
say i never saw so many shoes
the others gather to peer into the closet
frink loses interest immediately but whistles at the sight of nikkis sheer nightgown draped across her bed
he moves to it eagerly
nikki sits on the edge of the bed removing her shoes as frink picks up her silk bedclothes and examines them with a grin
bill pointedly takes the gown out of frinks hand
tight lipped frink stares at him
suddenly bill points to a small wind up clock on nikkis night table
bill drops the garment on the bed and moves to the night table
she never winds her clock
picks up the clock it says eleven and ive never been anywheres at eleven
nikki removes her earrings as frink walks off and cary takes a seat at the foot of the bed
dry to bill what time are you anywhere
bill shakes the clock and puts it to his ear listening
to cary ignoring nikki two oclock
its always two oclock in my life
besides never having any matches and always spilling her drinks she never winds her clock
think ill go in the bathroom and see if she leaves the cap off her tooth paste
bill heads for the bathroom but then stops and turns back to nikki
is it all right
bill disappears into the bathroom leaving nikki and cary sitting on the bed
nikki peers at cary through her lorgnette
friendly sympathetic hello
grins hello yourself
the phonograph music ends just as bills voice calls from the bathroom
excited cary turns toward the bathroom
shep runs past and hurries into the bathroom
cary rises from the bed to follow
nikki is perhaps mildly surprised by the excitement
swimming in shallow water at the bottom of a bathtub
a couple of decorative lily pads lie next to the drain
the turtles shells are inlayed with brilliants
bill kneels by the tub as frink shep francis and cary join him
bill points out his discovery to the others
thrilled it is turtles
francis picks up a turtle and shows it to cary
cary examines the turtle for a moment placing a finger on it
with a nod nice work boys
cary and francis inspect the turtle
nikki enters and addresses the men
and now do you suppose you could all excuse me
cary joins her
on account of id like to go to bed
sure well excuse you
ill clear everybody out of here
to the others come on you fellas
nikki wants to go to bed
the other men still lined up at the tub enjoying the turtles are disappointed
go to bed
they rise reluctantly
bill shakes water off his hand
yup all right
they file out of the bathroom
waves to the turtles so long turtles
good night turtles
frink follows the others humorlessly without a word to the turtles
the entire group exits the bathroom passes through the bedroom and heads into the sitting room
do you wanna go to sleep
nods mm hm
you should never go to sleep
with a wave to nikki well good night
as bill enters the sitting room he looks around and hurries away toward something he sees off screen
shep and francis follow
with a wave nighty night nikki
francis says nothing
good night nikki
frink is the last out the bedroom door though cary stays behind to linger a moment with nikki
bill takes a pillow from the sofa and tosses it across the room
he proceeds to leap feet first onto the sofa fall on his back with his feet in the air then stretch his legs out across the sofa lying down to
go to sleep
shep watching this scratches his head confused then moves to join him
frink watches francis drag some sort of heavy fringed rug to the floor near the sofa apparently preparing to lie down on it
nikki and cary stand close exchanging warm goodnights
dead serious good night cary
playful good night nikki
cary perhaps pleased with nikkis attention to him watches her withdraw into the bedroom and shut the door
he turns from the door to see four men happily situated settling in for a nights sleep bill and shep on the sofa frink on a chair their three pairs
of feet propped up on a table
francis his head on a pillow lies on the floor stretching his legs and yawning as only a narcoleptic can
i like this place
say i like this place too
i think its swell
peers at them skeptically hands on his hips
it suits me
you fellas think youre gonna park here
cary hears the bedroom door open behind him and turns to see opening the door wearing a robe carrying a bottle of eau de cologne and some towels
innocently will somebody please scrub my back
excited again bill jumps to his feet upsetting the others in the process
will somebody scrub your back
look out boys
the men struggle to their feet and follow him to holds the bottle in her hand
the mens hands reach for it but bill is quicker than the others and commandeers it with authority
i got it i got it i got it
from over nikkis nearly bare back we watch bill whistling jauntily as he shakes eau de cologne onto a towel
now seated watches this coolly as he takes out a cigarette and lights it
bill examines nikkis back with delight
impressed mmmmmm mm
his eyes pop
for nikki though this is an asexual activity
bill places her head on his left shoulder and prepares to scrub with his right
did anyone ever see such a back in their life
he scrubs a little
did anyone ever hear of such a thing
more scrubbing his tongue sticks out of his mouth as he studies his work
watch all this with envy and interest
just look at that back
just look at that thing wont you
bill keeps scrubbing adopting the air of a professional back scrubber
he lifts her hair to inspect her neck
he scrubs her neck
i could go on doin this a long time
more scrubbing and then an amusing pantomime to nikkis bewilderment bill pulls back the hair over her ear looks down into her ear cleans it out with his little finger
flicks wax off his finger daintily buffs the ear with the towel and finally blows sharply into the ear causing her to wince
she places her head on his shoulder again
we start on cary who sits rocking in a tilted chair and smoking watching bill and nikki with amusement
after a pause nikki
are you rich
beulah is rich
well just how rich is your mother
leave a lady a few secrets cant you
by now weve pulled back far enough to take in the whole group
bill finishes his scrubbing and nikki adjusts her robe
thank you william
that was ever so cool and nice
takes bottle and towels from him good night
to the others good night
good night nikki
they watch her move off
we hear the bedroom door close
bill realizes something snaps his fingers claps his hands and starts off
come on fellas
he rushes off
shep francis and frink rise and follow
cary merely collects his hat and cane and heads for the front door
bill and shep carry the sofa over and place it directly in front of nikkis closed bedroom door
francis brings his rug and pillow
watches them amused from the front door
youre gonna stay here huh
the men settle in for the night
to cary thats right
she might need some more help
bill waves good night and collapses on the sofa
frink glancing at cary brings his chair and sits in it
francis lies on the floor
shep fluffs pillows on the sofa etc
turns shuts off the lights opens the front door and exits the darkened room closing the door behind him
the drinking hole in nikkis hotel
a french woman noisily arranges dirty drinking glasses as bill francis and shep enter horribly hungover moaning and yawning and line up at the bar
a bartender greets them to take their order
um prairie oyster
shep has to nudge francis with an elbow
prairie oyster for three
bartender moves off
shep puts on his dark eyeglasses
we start on a close shot of three drinking glasses as the bartender breaks a raw egg into one
beside them are the other ingredients of a potent hangover remedy
we pan over to the three men say wed better get back to our hotel
theres no nikki at our hotel
and the bar doesnt open so early
why dont we move in here
lets stay here
but what about cary
to shep what about cary
to francis what about cary
francis shakes his head he has no idea
we can move him in too
francis nods in agreement
shep thinks it over as the drinks arrive
not a bad idea
shep pays off the bartender who departs with a mumbled thank you
the three men each down their nasty hangover cures in a single swallow and move off one at a time first shep who exhales deeply then francis who takes it
finally bill exhales happily and claps his hands as he follows the others out their hangovers apparently remedied
cheerfully well come on men
phonograph music plays as an asian maid the hotels specialist in chinois pedicure paints nikkis toenails
we pan up to discover nikki wearing a robe sitting in a chair next to the phonograph smoking a cigarette and checking on the progress of her paint job
a snappy knock at the door
opens and bill looking dapper enters
then shep enters wearing his dark eyeglasses and carrying a bouquet of flowers
next francis enters sleepily
in mid yawn hello
finally cary who closes the door behind him
good morning nikki
the men are all wearing suits and ties pleased to see her and stone sober
francis finds his way to the sofa which has been returned to its proper spot in the room
he lies down and shuts his eyes
from the sofa morning nikki
i didnt expect to see you all so early
shep puts the flowers in a vase
we camped on your doorsteps last night
and this morning we all moved in
cary leans over her affectionately
despite your practically innumerable faults we adore you
weve decided to adopt you
bill and shep kneel next to nikki
bill notices the toenail painting
well for heavens sakes
look at nikki
what are you having done to yourself gal
whatcha having your toes painted for nikki
cary stands behind nikki as she looks down at her toes
i dont know
looks at bill and shep seemed like a good idea at the time
nikki bill and shep share a laugh
the asian woman goes right on painting as bill and shep study nikkis legs
during this nikki hands her cigarette to cary who moves to put it in an ashtray by the window
why look at nikkis legs would you
that there is practically the loveliest pair of legs i ever saw in all my born days
like my legs
cary stares out the window at a rainy day
look at those legs cary
my they nearly match
cary turns from the window
did you ever see such a swell set of legs
well what do you want me to do about it
burst into tears
would it embarrass you nikki if cary were to burst into tears
looks at her legs on account of my legs
turns to cary heartfelt i think that would be sweet
cary manages a slight grin
as he does theres a knock at the door
everyone hollers entrez
shep runs to the door and opens it
here come the drinks
the others cheer happily
two hotel employees enter carrying trays loaded with already poured drinks
shep hands a glass to nikki
here nikki drink this
make you laugh and play
thats what i want to do laugh and play
shep hands bill a glass
francis sits groggily on the sofa a drink in each hand
he polishes off one and then the other
he leans over and sets one empty glass on the floor but holds on to the other as he puts his head to the nearby pillow and dozes off
cary bill and shep crowd around nikki who is still seated all have drinks
the tray carrying hotel employees have apparently exited
bill proposes a toast
heres to nikkis dainty legs
as smooth and hairless as an egg
another knock at the door
they all yell entrez
the door opens to reveal frink whose face falls when he sees the other men with nikki
the others are not happy to see him either
here comes that licentious old man
who invited him
cary hands his glass to bill and moves to meet frink as he enters
sneering still drinking
shakes his head mockingly how can you tell
cary watches frink approach nikki
after a pause nikki looks up at him uncertainly as if she doesnt recognize him
then she peers at him through her lorgnette
oh its you
after a pause reluctantly polite wont you sit down
frink moves off to find a chair
shep sets down his drink and follows him
frink starts to move a chair but shep stops him
say i dont think nikki likes you
what do you wanna hang around for
well what do you hang around for
why i came to bring nikki some posies
ill bet you didnt bring nikki any posies
i well during the above dialogue bill nudges cary mischievously and they glance down at the tray in front of them
they exchange knowing nods pick up some drinks bring them over and offer one to frink
have a drink
cure the shakes
i havent got the shakes
hold out your hands
bill and shep watch with interest as frink holds out his hands palms up
no turn them over
frink turns them over palms down
cary looks at frinks steady hands impressed
say thats pretty good
cary looks down at the drink in his own hand
lets see if you can hold this
cary sets the glass on top of frinks downturned hand
frink balances the full glass with ease
say thats great
cary places a second full glass on frinks other hand
frink balances both glasses with ease
cary expresses keen admiration
steady as a rock
frink looks at the others a little smugly
cary slowly backs away and walks off as do the others
frinks face falls as he realizes he has been left standing in the middle of the room with two drinks balanced on top of his hands and no way to
safely remove them
cary shep and bill return to nikki and crowd around her
well i guess thatll keep his hands out of mischief for a while
frink abandoned reluctantly pleads with the others
take these off
but the others simply ignore him
now lets see
where were we before we were so rudely interrupted
we were talkin about nikkis legs
we were talkin about nikkis legs
and havin a fine time too
the asian maid who has been working on nikkis feet abruptly rises
the men cheer yay
and nikki smiles at the woman as she exits with her tools
the men crowd closer to peer down at nikkis legs
lets inspect the job
but nikki quickly covers her toes with a hand
oh my poor toes
dont look too close
nikki wraps her robe around her legs and stuffs them under body
since shes no longer using her footstool cary commandeers it and sits on it
well whats the matter with your toes
nikki grows extremely somber and begins to tell a story very slowly
her eyes stare into space and her voice conveys terrible sadness
when i was a little girl
a worried look crosses carys face
my mother bought me a new pair of shoes
and they were way too short
shep and bill listen soberly
and i had to walk all the way to sunday school and back
down the road
and it was hot and dusty
hand to his face oh take her away
shes breakin my heart
sobs and when i got home
my toes were spoiled
on the verge of tears oh dear oh dear
thats such a sad story
lets all have a drink quick
their eyes pop
the men jump up eagerly and run off
nikki thoroughly nonplussed by this takes a sip of her drink
shep cary and bill crowd around a tray and start imbibing
meanwhile frink looks around unsuccessfully for a way to lose the two glasses that are still balanced on his hands
for the first time in this scene nikki is on her feet
she walks over to the drink tray and puts a friendly hand on the shoulders of shep and cary
and now would you all excuse me
on account of im gonna put on a dress
well why not
nikki walks off exiting into her bedroom
the men continue to stand around the tray drinking
in the background francis sleeps on the sofa
over by the fireplace a frustrated frink still balancing the two drinks casts a dirty look at the others
he angrily hurls the glasses into the fireplace smashing them loudly
francis startled awake by the noise jumps off the sofa
the others stare at him
whats he getting so excited about
frink furious rubs his hands with a handkerchief and stuffs it in his pocket
you guys think youre so darn smart
shep bill and cary laugh at this
cary consults his pocket watch
well cheerio fellas
bill waves goodbye
cary eats a last olive tosses the toothpick and heads for the front door
see ya later
cary exits as nikkis voice drifts in from nikki o
what are the plans for the day
shep drink in hand enters and leans on the wall outside the door
well on account of its raining and everything we thought wed go over to the cluny and play billiards and drink beer
how about cary
went to get his hat and coat
hes going to pere lachaise
whats pere lachaise
how bout you coming with us
im going with cary
concerned youve been invited
nikki appears in the doorway dressed to go out
do you think cary might object
well i have an idea hed like to be alone
well cary likes to be alone
hes as brittle as a breadstick
one silly crack from you and he might break up in sections
thinks about this well then i dont think he should be left alone
beat tell me whats cary doing in paris
what are we all doing in paris
but why doesnt he go home
well hes not ready to go home
what could he do if he went home
have people cry over his hands
well it seems a pity to go on like this
hes such a sweet soul
one of the best
isnt he just sort of wasting himself
on the contrary
hes trying awfully hard to get hold of himself
lost in thought nikki moves off and a worried shep follows her to shep stops nikki from leaving
shes a little downcast as he admonishes her now listen
if you tag along for heavens sake be careful what you say
dont start getting sorry for him and dont cry over him
with a chuckle and above all dont make any unfortunate remarks hear
earnest oh i wont
why who ever heard of such a thing
nikki opens the front door and exits into where cary carrying coat hat and cane emerges from a suite across the hall from nikkis and heads for the elevator
he stops when he hears nikki calling to him
she runs to join him
im coming with you
without waiting for a reply she starts for the elevator then stops to look down at her shoes
to cary ooh wait for nikki
she leaves him and runs back to of her suite where shep still stands
he watches with surprise as nikki runs in
calls back to cary wait for nikki
puzzled shep follows nikki who rushes to nikki draws the curtain to reveal her enormous collection of dresses and shoes
shep drink in hand wanders in slowly and leans against the doorjamb as he watches nikki pull off one pair of shoes and put on a seemingly identical pair of
what are you changing your shoes for
on account of i can walk faster in red shoes
shep watches her hop and scurry off
passerbys carry umbrellas on this rainy day
a taxi cab pulls up to a sidewalk cafe la regence according to the awning that covers the little iron tables
cary emerges from the cab and pays off the driver as nikki hurries under the awning
cary joins her and after a word to the driver restez ici
looks at the rain
to nikki perhaps wed better stay here a while till it clears up
could we sit down here do you suppose
i think so
would you like something to drink
they move toward the cafe
as cary hangs up his hat a waiter arrives
what should i drink now do you suppose
cary orders the drinks as nikki moves to sit at a table
to the waiter deux picon citrons
the waiter acknowledges this and heads inside calling out the order to his bartender
cary joins nikki at the table and sits down
she removes her gloves and fixes her face while he takes out a cigarette and lights it under the following picon citrons
make you laugh and play
amused thats what you always promise
suddenly serious cary why does shep lambert go on drinking so desperately
dont we all
not like shep
well shep has that tic under his eye you know
takes a lot of drinks to keep that quiet
but isnt there some kind of treatment or something
shep could never stand a long course of treatment
drinkings the only corrective so far as hes concerned
hes found out the tic doesnt work when hes tight
so he stays tight
the waiter arrives with the drinks
as he spritzes seltzer water into their glasses cary leans over to light a cigarette for nikki
the waiter leaves and they drink
seems such a pity
how did he get the tic
in the war
well its not very romantic
well dont tell me if you dont want to
well you see a tic is a nervous habit
lice under his bandages
he had the devil of a time
he nearly lost his mind
so youll have to excuse him a little
im so sorry for shep
well dont let him know it
well isnt he going home
not in his dark glasses anyway
cant something be done for him
hell have to be reborn
hows he going to end
well how are you going to end
how am i going to end
how is anyone going to end
hows your picon citron go
it goes fine
but doesnt anything make any difference to you
a long time ago perhaps when i was a little boy
tell me where were you little
on a farm
were you happy then cary
i think so
tell me what was there to be happy about on a farm in minnesota
lost in thought ohhh thorn apple trees in blossom
the smell of burning leaves in the fall
the sound of horses hoofs on the road
looks at nikki did you ever dig up an indian mound or uncover a nest of baby field mice
or explore old trunks in an attic
listen to the moaning of the telephone wires in the winter wind
see a gypsy caravan
enthralled so thats why you were happy
on account of apple blossoms and field mice and telephone wires and gypsy caravans and old trunks and things
nikki exhales drinks looks at cary and shakes her head
but arent you going back
would you like another picon citron before you go
the rain is lifting
nikki finishes the last of her drink
im ready now
cary leaves some money nikki gathers her things
they rise and walk off
cary and nikki stroll into view arm in arm and look around
the rain has stopped
they are the only living people in the ancient cemetery
who all is buried here
oh poets painters philosophers cocoanut
poets painters philosophers musicians
cary looks around points with his cane
oh i practiced him
he gives her a look and they move on
and theres balzac
and theres heloise and abelard
oh tell me about abelise and eloard
not abelise and eloard
heloise and abelard
i really didnt do it on purpose
it was on account of the picon citron
tell me about heloise and abelard
well theyre buried here in the same sepulchre side by side
why are they buried side by side
they were the worlds most famous lovers
looks off points with his cane theres the tomb
they approach the large tomb which is fenced off by a low iron gate
cary removes his hat nikki peers at the double sepulchre through her lorgnette
tell me about the worlds most famous lovers
well abelard was a scholastic philosopher whatever that is
whatever that is
he gained a footing in a certain household as tutor to a maiden called heloise
and employed his unlimited opportunities for the purpose of well betrayal
not however unmixed with real love
he carried her off to brittany
tell me more
well her uncle was furious
he blamed abelard for the whole thing
he conceived a terrible revenge
uneasy im afraid for abelard
he broke into abelards apartment one night and perpetrated upon him the most brutal punishment
the lovers were forced to live their lives apart
but when they died they were buried here side by side
peers down at the ground theres a story that little heart shaped stones are supposed to grow around the tomb
heart shaped stones
and lovers come and find them and exchange them with each other
looks at nikki and so long as you keep the stone from the tomb of heloise and abelard no harm can come to your true love
how perfectly beautiful
isnt that a quaint legend
they crouch at the iron bars of the gate surrounding the tomb and take off their gloves under the following do you think i might find a heart shaped stone
you help me cary
all right nikki
only we have to leave soon
looks off they close up the place
just as soon as we find our stones
they reach through the gate to poke at the rocks and gravel surrounding the tomb
after a moment nikki rises and walks off excitedly with a stone in her hand
i found one
cary too finds a stone and rises to join her
as the couple sits near the tomb
they show each other the stones in their upturned hands
nikki takes the heart shaped stone from her palm and places it in carys stiff weathered hand
then she transfers his stone to her hand
and now you take mine
and ill take yours
they close their hands over the stones as we pull back to a wider view of nikki and cary smiling at one another
isnt that the way the story goes
thats right nikki
and now no harm can come to our true love
amused and now well have to go
he starts to rise but she puts a hand on his arm
you were so nice to let me come with you
i spoiled your whole day
you were going to do something else werent you
looks away doesnt matter
well what was it cary
why did you come here today
not looking at her to pay my respects to an old comrade
and you wanted to be alone
oh im so sorry
begins to weep softly dont pay any attention to me cary
i cant help it
you make me cry
he stares at her astonished as she rambles on
oh dont look so troubled cary
im all right
i just want to cry for a minute
puts a hand on his shoulder on account of youre so nice
youre so clean cary
and your teeth are so white
youre so civilized
you dont care about anything any more nor anybody
nothing makes any difference to you
nothing can touch you
realizes why youre lost
youre all lost
you and shep and the rest of you
takes his hand oh i want to do something for you
i want to help you
looks at his wrist let me wash your bracelet cary
points why see
the silvers all tarnished
the silvers all tarnished
removes his bracelet ill take it with me and scrub it when i get home
ill polish it with my nail brush
nikki turns to put the bracelet in her purse
thoroughly unnerved by this emotional outburst cary looks around
its getting dark
cary rises deeply uncomfortable
nikki tries to make amends
rises cheerily anyway we found a name for my turtles
cary turns and looks at her amazed
heloise and abelard
a name for your turtles
so thats what you were looking for
i might have known how it would end
he looks down at the heart shaped stone held awkwardly in his stiff hand
his thumb brushes the stone and it falls to the ground
nikki sits soberly polishing carys bracelet with her nail brush
shep enters drink in hand
she looks at shep forlornly
shep walks over and confronts her
carys in a state
says hes going away
cant stand it any longer and all that sort of thing
sits on the bed what happened between you two anyway
cary seemed so sad and everything on account of id taken up his whole afternoon
sighs so little nikki said all merry and bright well anyway wed found a name for my turtles
a name for the turtles
shep cracks up with laughter and falls backward on the bed his head dangling over the edge
shep keeps laughing twists around on the bed and sits up again
name for the turtles
thats so funny all right
shep holds a hand to his head and catches his breath as nikki joins him on the bed
why do you always have to be funny at the wrong time
didnt i tell you cary was brittle
how did he respond to that line
morosely pulled down the iron curtain
shep cracks up again
worried nikki tugs at his sleeve
did he say he was going away
through his laughter yup
gotta get away from it all
then youve got to go to him right now
nikki rises and urgently pulls shep helpless with laughter to his feet
and explain that i didnt mean it
tell him how it was and everything
listen no go on
you go right now before its too late
she pushes him toward the door
you go right straight to cary
cary removes clothes from a rack as a now serious shep drink in hand stands nearby trying to reason with him
now listen cary you dont have to behave like an old easter egg
youre breaking nikkis heart
she doesnt know any better
she doesnt know any better
well whether she does or not im going a long ways away from nikki
nikki and her turtles
you sure are in an uproar
what you need is a drink
cary packs a weathered suitcase
i need more than a drink
i need a lot of geography between me and that girl
where do you want to go
so long as its a long way from nikki
pauses looks at shep you know that girl does things to me
back to packing ive got to get away
well i wonder whats happening in portugal tonight
cary stops packing and gives shep a look
thinks it over i wonder what is happening in portugal tonight
shep stares at cary astonished and moves off
cary sets his packed suitcase upright
bill and shep set a large steamer trunk upright
bill opens the trunk
there you go
nikki appears carrying a suitcase
if carys going to portugal why cant we go to portugal too
aint we got any rights
sure we got rights
getting organized for their own impromptu portuguese expedition bill francis and shep fill the trunk with nikkis things as frink leans on it smoking a cigarette and eyeing nikki coolly
cary better not think he can screw up in portugal and leave old shep behind
say whens he leaving
ten thirty in the morning
dont we have to have passports and things
sure we gotta have passports
bill joins nikki
what kind passports you like
what kind passports you got

grandly ill take vanilla
she brushes past him and crosses to a table where she is joined by frink
good night nikki
ill see you on the train
youre goin too
with a sly smile i might uh pick up a couple of features for my paper in portugal
frink walks out the door
nikki sighs a little and then busies herself with carrying items the trunk
shep arrives with a selection of dresses as the group crowds together
chaotic overlapping dialogue nikki do you want
did you put all my shoes in
there they are i dont know how youre going to get all these dresses in nikki
from the trunk we a mountain of trunks and other luggage piled on the floor
nikki sits down near shep who finishes packing a suitcase on the floor
dont we have to go like anything
the train leaves in twenty minutes
francis leans casually on the towering pile of luggage
bill stands next to him smoking a cigarette and calling ironically to nikki are you sure you have everything
misses the irony i i think so
francis clicks his tongue as he regards the pile
dryly hardly seems enough
suddenly nikki gasps and rises
oh my turtles
are plucked from the tub and placed in
by nikkis little asian maid
the fancy beribboned wicker basket has an oversized handle which makes it a rather improbable turtle carrier
bill secures a wire mesh covering over the basket and carries it out of the bathroom handing it grandly to francis
here you are francis
youre the custodian of the turtles
now dont fall down on the job
bill walks off
francis calls after him worried hey
i never tended turtles before
nikki arrives with a bottle of water and soaks her hand
now all you have to do she gives francis the bottle and sprinkles the turtles with water from her wet hand
is to sprinkle em now and then like this
some of the water ends up in francis eye which he wipes with the baskets ribbon
nikki walks off and francis practices soaking his hand and sprinkling the turtles
five bellhops march in and under the direction of nikki and the men proceed to carry off the luggage chattering in french
well were off
to a bellhop about the trunk be careful of that one
burdened with luggage the bellhops file out through the suite
bill suitcase in hand follows them out beckoning to francis behind him
uh come on francis
take those turtles
francis hurries along carrying the basket followed by shep and nikki
a whistle blows
their luggage already aboard francis nikki shep and bill walk down the platform parallel to the train
bill claps his hands exuberantly
there she is boys
the sud express
can you imagine cary tryin to run away and leave us behind
nikki peers at the train through her lorgnette
do you suppose hes really gonna be here
sure hell be here
hes never missed a train in his life
say do you suppose the turtlesll be all right with that porter
bill gives francis a supportive pat on the back
aw sure theyll be all right
all you got to do is gestures with his hand sprinkle em
francis nods soberly
nikki points excited
there he is
cary buys a paper from a newsboy and steps onto his train
on the train steps cary stops and turns as his friends arrive and gather around him grinning
surprised well hello
what are you all doing down here
we just came down to see you off is all
well thats darn decent of you
ya got a nice seat
yeah right by a window
oh how nice for you
with childlike desire come on
show us your seat by the window
cheerful insistent yeah come on cary
we wanna see that seat by the window
climbing the steps bill and shep crowd a confused cary and force him into the train
following the others francis helps nikki up the steps
come on nikki
they all board the train and head for the group crowds into the small compartment
my my what a swell train
sud express train de luxe
say i wonder if a chap can get a drink on this train
i dont see why not
push the button
bill pushes a button for the porter
flustered well im afraid you wont have time for a drink

youll have to get off
everyone but cary grabs a seat
astonished cary stares at each as they speak get off
we like this train
this is a train de luxe
yes we like trains de luxe dont we nikki
trains de luxe is what we like
the whistle blows
hes blowing the whistle
grabs sheps shoulder hey were gonna start
well let her start
the trains starts
bill jauntily throws his hat up to the luggage rack above and the others settle in for their journey
let er go gallagher
frink enters casually
cary is stunned
frink sits down with the others
and you too
the group takes in the trains departure with perfect composure
cary stands and looks at them for a moment before breaking into a understanding grin
as the train hurtles out of the now empty station nikki suddenly turns to the window and waves goodbye to no one at all goodbye
dont forget to write
shep bill and francis quickly join in waving and shouting goodbye much to carys amusement
even frink manages a smile at this
racing down the track
the compartment doorway
we hear the men laughing
bill drink in hand his necktie loosened and his coat off appears in the doorway coming from the trains corridor
look what i found
with a grand gesture bill presents an elderly british gentleman who follows him into the little room greeted with a cheer of hooray
from the men who sit around similarly coatless save frink smoking and drinking
various bottles stand on a central table
the old gentleman is greeted warmly but its never clear whether he is an old friend or a total stranger
have a drink
ah thank you no not i
bill and the old gentleman sit down
nikki dozes in her seat by the window
the basket of turtles hangs from above
i i say are you all going to portugal
were going down there to investigate conditions
drinking conditions mostly
by the way what are conditions
dont you know what conditions are
never saw one in my life
the drinking conditions are pretty bad right here
chuckles skeptically glancing at the bottles ahh indeed
my beers full of cinders
good for ya
make ya lay hard shelled eggs
the men laugh
a whistle blows
the conductor appears briefly in the doorway to announce in french that the mademoiselles compartment is ready
the man says your compartments ready
nikki wakes rises and clutching her pillow heads for the doorway
im glad on account of its been so hot and im so tired and i want to go to bed
going to bed
who ever heard of such a thing
bill rises to confer with her at the door
can we help you undress
no thank you william
the old gentleman looks rather astonished at this casual exchange
take off your shoes
undo your hair
scrub your back or something
no i can manage quite well by myself
good night everybody
the men say good night
frink who has been watching nikki with a predatory eye is the most polite good night nikki
nikki turns and disappears down the corridor
the old gentleman mops his brow with a handkerchief and stuffs it in his collar
can you imagine that ungrateful old trollop
she wouldnt let them help her undress
cant understand it at all
you know shes not very pretty
but when she was a little girl her mother always said she had the nicest hair ribbons
she got one tooth turned around she cant see very far and shes always speaking out of turn
otherwise shes a mighty fine piece of architecture
mm seems to need a few repairs
during the next exchange frink seated by the door grins at bill and shep then notices francis dozing off
frink cautiously rises and exits into the corridor without anyone noticing his departure
shes got eyes like an assyrian queens got eyes
you aint never seen no assyrian queen
youre just a makin that up outta yore own head
i did so see an assyrian queen
in whose green hat
in the metropolitan museums green hat thats whose green hat
francis pocket watch chimes
he wakes rises puts on his hat and moves absently toward the door
seeing this shep bill and cary shout at him whoa
francis pauses in the doorway and sleepily turns to the others
hold on there
where you goin
youre not going anywhere
youre on a train
you go back to your turtles hear
youve been neglecting your assignment
francis moves to the hanging basket of turtles takes off his hat and bottle in hand wets his fingers and sprinkles the turtles
curious the old gentleman rises to join him
francis explains as he works i have to sprinkle the turtles see
sprinkle the turtles
the old gentleman nods and clicks his tongue with understanding
cool em off
turtles get feverish on trains
a womans scream drifts in from the corridor
the men hear nikki screaming
francis cary bill and shep in that order scramble out the door leaving the old gentleman behind
the men rush down the corridor to frink grapples with a half dressed nikki his lips pressed to her neck as she struggles to free herself from his grasp
energized by nikkis peril francis bursts in and pulls frink away from her
nikki grabs a wrap from the turned down bed and covers herself as frink pushes francis hard into a nearby wall knocking him to the floor
get out of here
frink turns back to a defiant nikki as cary enters and sees a dazed francis slumped against the wall clutching his head
cary grabs frinks shoulder and spins him around
say whats the idea
whats the idea
well what business is that of yours
by now bill and shep have entered and joined the tense confrontation
nikki you all right
what is this tough trying to do to you anyway
well i was just going to bed and he came in and flang himself all over me
frink youd better get out of here right away before something happens to you
what right have you to tell me to get out of here
this isnt your compartment is it
oh i see
you wanna argue about it
if you dont clear out of here right now youre liable to get hurt
suppose you put me out
savagely put him out
ill snap his spine and throw him off the train
cary rolls his eyes at this remark and wisely holds bill back
hold everything bill
distraught nikki sinks down on a chair
oh dear does everybody have to act like this
frink turns to her in protest
im not gonna let these silly drunks tell me where to get off
silly drunks did you say
and that goes for the whole bunch of you
let me have him
to bill wait a minute
ill take care of him
you will eh
frink starts to strong arm cary
cary punches frink in the jaw knocking him onto the bed
as frink slumps down to floor and leans against the bed half conscious francis rises and watches the proceedings with a hand on his head
cary fist still tightly clenched stands over the dazed frink as bill brightens considerably and wipes his hands with delight
now aint that nice
have you ever seen anything so cute
francis exits uncertainly
will you be all right now nikki
unsure uh huh
to bill and shep grab hold of that fella and drag him out of here
bill and shep haul frink to his feet
come to papa
nikki watches bill and shep lead frink out the door
francis sits by the window rubbing his head
cary arrives and sits down next to him
cary takes francis water bottle and hands it to him
do your stuff
bill and shep carry frink in and dump him on the seat opposite francis
bill walks off wiping his hands happily
the others are grim furious at frink for his actions
shep watches a disgusted francis soak his hand and sprinkle frink as if he were one of nikkis turtles
frink snaps out of his daze
frink dont you know better than to try a stunt like that
oh i i lost my head over the girl is all
well you apologize to nikki in the morning
and dont you ever get out of line again
the next time it might be different
francis pointedly sprinkles frink one last time
they give each other a dark look
francis fingers the neck of the water bottle as if he were going to use it to smash frink in the face
as they glare ominously at one another we crowded city street
a superimposed title reads lisbon cocktail shaker in the hands of an expert who shakes it rhythmically as appropriate latin music begins
this dissolves to a kaleidoscopic view of our protagonists enjoying the night life nikkis image dominates at the center surrounded by images of the men in dinner clothes
everyone drinks except frink who smokes a cigarette and stares desirous and snakelike presumably at nikki
dissolve to nikki and her war birds minus frink seated at a bar in an otherwise empty club late at night wearing goofy party hats
they swallow a last drink and start to leave laughing talking merrily blowing little party horns taking a bottle or two with them and waving to an unseen bartender as
someone says good night
we track in for a closer look at the bar covered with many empty glasses
and the music and the montage end
cary wearing a robe sees shep still asleep in bed
cary puts on a party hat sits on the edge of his own bed opposite sheps picks up a party horn and blows into it hard
the horn squeals horribly
shep wakes with a start and sits up in bed completely unnerved
cary laughs at him and with his clenched hands picks up a bottle
wake up ya big sissy
pours a drink here drink this
itll make you laugh and play like any old thing
shep groans and sighs as cary hands him a glass with his fists
say cary what day is this
what month i mean
you mean to say you dont know what month this is
i knew once but i forgot
well its june
the merry month of june
say maybe i better get up
cary looks at shep amused
what town are we in
youre in lisbon portugal
thats where i thought it was
i just wanted to check up is all
a little concerned say whats the matter with you shep
dont you really know where you are or what day it is
i kind of lose track of things
say this is getting serious
cary lets the goofy hat fall off his head into his hand and sets it aside
is anything serious any more
well its serious when you dont know where youre at
whats gonna become of you
by now shep has polished off his drink
he sets down the empty glass
oh ill be all right when ive had a couple of drinks
say what town did you say this was
i just told you lisbon
come on now pull yourself together shep
we gotta get organized for the bull fight
shep excited gets out from under the bedcovers
like a little kid bull fight
are we going to a bull fight
a portuguese bull fight
is that guy frink coming along
gee isnt there any way we can get rid of that guy
somebodyll have to shoot him
shep rises and walks off
not a bad idea at that
cary watches him go and blows his party horn wryly
a bugler blows his own horn grandly while standing before colorful bull fight posters that read corrida de touros a crowd files in under an arched entranceway
our little group enters dressed for a day at the fights
praca de touros
and sure enough the words over a decorated archway read praca de touros i wonder if theres a bar inside or anything
a friendly english speaking portuguese man named pedro overhears this and joins them
sure there is a bar
lets find the bar
we gotta get organized for the bull fight
right this way
pedro leads and they happily follow
led by their guide pedro the group files in and lines up at the bar
a tiny extremely drunken old man is the only other customer
lookit that bar would ya
isnt that a beautiful thing
what are you all gonna have
beer is what i want
orders cinco cervejas
nikki and cary stand together at the bar
i dont like beer
make you leap like a tuna
dont wanna leap like a tuna
make you bark like a fox
dont wanna bark like a fox
make you laugh and play
thats what i wanna do
laugh and play
to the bartender hey
bill glass raised proposes a toast
on the wall behind him is the shadow of the drunken old man standing in roughly the same pose
well men fire and fall back
as bill drinks the old mans shadow wobbles forward
bill hears the sound of liquid spattering
he stops drinking and looks puzzled
a stream of liquid pours down onto bills right foot soaking his sock and shoe
bill turns to find the drunken old man leaning at an unsteady angle the alcohol spilling steadily out of a glass in the mans hand and onto bills foot
whats the idea
the others lined up at the bar see this and laugh
the drunken old man brushes some lint off bills jacket as bill shakes his pant leg amused
well i hope i dont catch a cold in my left ear
band music plays
cary looks up concerned
hey drink your drinks
well miss the parade
the group hurriedly finish and exit
shep pays the tab
bill followed by the old man shakes his pant leg and limps along after the others
the crowd cheers and the band plays as a parade of matadors picadors and banderilleros enters the ring
led by their guide pedro the group takes seats in the front row back of the trenches
they have to sit close down so nikki can see things
the drunken old man from the bar tags along behind bill like a puppy dog and tries to sit next to him but pedro pointedly directs him to a seat
in the second row
when bill rises to cheer the parade the drunken old man also rises and taps him affectionately on the shoulder
bill turns and greets him pleasantly shaking his hand
my old pal
the old man tips his hat to bill and sits
bill shakes his pant leg and gives the old man a wry look before also sitting
the parade ends
a matador throws his montera his black woolen hat into the crowd
cary catches the hat much to the groups delight they shout hooray
immediately a cape is hurled at bill who drapes it over the railing before them
cary offers the hat to nikki
nikki heres a present for you
oh a hat
oh senor no no no you must not keep the hat
you must put a little present in it and return it to the matador after the fight
what kind of present
well eh a little jewelry
something you have like the chain or the watch or the the the cigarette case or the cuff links or or the vanilla
a trumpet fanfare
the crowd cheers
bill points excited
here he comes
a bull charges into view
bull fighter and bull face off
the bull makes ten passes faster and closer each time
bill sits next to pedro
whats so good about it
he works close to the bull
is that so dangerous
sure its dangerous
bull fighting is very dangerous
it takes a lot of courage to go into the bull ring
bill scoffs and waves dismissively
cary leans in with a query
is it true the bull is blind when he charges
he sees only the cape perhaps
bull fighter and bull continue their duel
finally the bull gets the advantage and others must rush in to distract the bull
bill is unimpressed
bet i could run that bull bow legged
you know i should have been a bull fighter
you should have started at twelve years of old
i bet i could start right now
puts a hand on bills shoulder sit still and behave yourself
bull fighting is not for americans
you think we havent got the nerve or something
why listen bull fighting is just for us the latins
he thinks were a scared
helpfully he tackled a horse once
stares at bill tackle a horse
full of himself bill nods
turns away flatly is not the same
everyone suddenly stares in shock as the bull knocks down the matador
others rush in to distract the bull which runs wild out of control
frink nudges francis awake and points out the carnage in the ring
francis glances at the spectacle briefly and then sleepily applauds
frink gives him a look and nudges him to stop clapping
francis simply goes back to sleep
the toreros try to control the bull but it refuses to cooperate
the crowd watches intently
bill takes off his own hat and picks up the matadors cap that cary had caught
toreros scramble and run for their lives
the bull chases them down runs across the ring forcing them to jump the barrera the protective wooden barrier that circles the inside of the arena
bill now wearing the cap cant resist leaning over and mocking a group of toreros who huddle in the callejon the safe side of the barrier just below him
nice work tony
nice work joe
the toreros look up at bill in surprise
one of them responds in portuguese with a gesture toward the ring as if to ask if its so easy why dont you try it
the other toreros laugh
bill stares into the ring a savage look in his eyes
he puts a leg up on the railing
he jumps down into the ring
cary rises stunned
come back here
but it is too late
bills coat is already off and he waves it like a cape as he stalks after the bull
the bull turns and sees him
bill moves toward it waving his coat and grinning like a madman
shep is frozen
beside him nikki screams and turns away
the bull begins to charge
cary climbs over the railing
the bull charges
track fast toward bill who holds the coat before him big eyes big grin
the bull is on him
the bull roars
bills face snaps backward in a blur his coat follows
the bull gores him through his coat
his face twists in pain
cut wide as the bull knocks bills body around the ring like a rag doll
he hits the ground hard
screams from the crowd
four toreros rush in
they surround and distract the bull
bill lies motionless
cary runs across the ring
more toreros and others rush in surrounding the bull finally leading away
in the front row shep nikki francis frink and pedro watch with concern as toreros converge on bill and try to move his body
cary joins them
but bill is unconscious
a torero says something to cary in portuguese
cary and the others lift bill
take it easy
take it easy
they carry bill off
a group of toreros straighten their gleaming spangled jackets and walk off to reveal cary standing over a bloodied bill and holding his hand as medical personnel prepare to operate
bill lies flat on a table and smiles amused with himself
you were doing fine
wasnt i though
its a cinch
just as easy bill breaks off and raises his head to look at the doctor off screen
what are you doing
to distract him cary pulls out a handkerchief and mops bills brow which glistens with sweat
you know why i slipped cary
on account of that beer in my shoe
bill breaks off and raises himself up again
cary gently eases bills head back down
cary that bull certainly was hostile
pedro escorts shep in his dark eyeglasses again and nikki into the room
the doctor in surgical gear puts on gloves and looks annoyed by the intrusion
you hurt bill
you all right bill
im all right
i was a big success
the doctor has some sharp words for pedro who acknowledges this and approaches the others he wants that we should go right away
im sure glad that i i wore my new blue shorts
ill be a big success in the hospital
nikki places a hand on his head
ill send you my turtles bill
and then youll be a big success
she turns away trying not to cry
shep follows her as they leave
so long bill
shep follows nikki out
bill reaches up and pats cary on the shoulder
cary looks at the doctor then at bill before retreating to the door
he turns to look back at bill who grins at him
see ya later cary
cary cant return the smile
he turns and goes closing the door behind him
bills attention turns to the doctor whose approaching shadow is cast on the wall behind him
bills smile fades
cary emerges and joins the group who are gathered glumly on some steps
how is he
theyve just put him to sleep
nikki emotionally fragile hands cary his hat
why thank you nikki
theres nothing you can do
youd better go back to the hotel
to francis put nikki in a taxi
well wait here
as frink and francis exit with nikki pedro approaches cary with a couple of journalists
senor the reporters want to know why your friend descend into the bull ring
cary looks off and thinks for a moment
tell them that it seemed like a good idea at the time
pedro stares at cary in astonishment
cary joins shep and the two of them stand with their backs to the others as we the amusement park at port mayer
crowds carnival noises a carousel with appropriate music
at a nearby refreshment stand we find the group minus bill
everyone is unusually silent and wearing dinner clothes
francis holds a mug upside down
frink leers at nikki who ignores him while she shep and cary down their drinks
they hear they look over to see a little shooting gallery where customers rent genuine guns to shoot various colorful targets and win prizes
sounds like old times
lets go and shoot
not a bad idea
to nikki what say annie oakley
like to fire off a gun at something
to their bartender well be right back
the group starts over to where an assortment of rifles and pistols are neatly laid out
cary and shep escort nikki to the arsenal while frink and francis tag along behind
an attendant joins them to collect their money and ready their weapons
first one to miss pays for the drinks
whatll we shoot at
shoot one of those pussycats and see what happens
look out pussycat
shep fires and misses the moving cats that float across the base of the range on an endless chain and disappear
but he hits a tinier target a clay pipe behind them
sheps eyes pop with surprise
well thats what i was aiming at a clay pipe
stares in amazement whole things been misrepresented to me
cary laughs at him
cary lets see you shoot something
cary takes careful aim
look out ball
he fires and hits a ball balanced atop a stream of water
whatd you aim at
well lets see you shoot something
nikki awkwardly raises her little target rifle to her shoulder
the end of the barrel describes uncertain circles in the air
a multiple exposure point of view shot of the targets reveals that nikki is a little too tipsy to be handling a gun
cary moves to help her
oh no no no nikki
how do you hold it still
listen nikki on your right shoulder
now put your hand out there and hold up no dont cover up the site
no no no thats right
now just hold it evenly rapid gunshots
cary looks up in surprise
he and shep turn to watch in amazement as francis cuts loose with an automatic rifle shattering a whole row of pipes with split second firing
the others cheer as francis lowers the weapon and stares moodily at an astonished and apparently very drunk frink
cary takes this moment to encourage nikki
you can do better than that
show him up
she again tries unsuccessfully to hold the rifle steady
amused frink picks up a pistol and imitates her
what are you waving at nikki
cary sees frink pointing his gun at nikki and moves to intervene grabbing frinks wrist with both hands
angry look out
why you fool
dont you know better than that
shep and francis move to shield nikki
whats the idea
pointing a loaded gun at nikki
take your hands off me
put down that gun
let go of my wrist
frink violently pulls free of carys grasp and as he does the gun goes off with a bang
francis hurries nikki to safety in the opposite direction
shep backs away clutching his side for a moment it looks very much as if hes been hit
cary pursues and confronts frink
put down that gun
frink backs up to a nearby lamp post and wielding the pistol points it at cary
his face is tense savage
listen you keep your hands off me
ive had enough from you
you try any more of your rough stuff on me
a nervous crowd of passersby pauses to watch the showdown
oh so thats how it is
i thought we taught you how to behave
frink drunk and frustrated starts to lose it completely
you taught me how to behave
listen youd better behave now or youll get hurt
calmly i dont think so
ill give you three to put down that gun
itll be just too bad if you dont
too bad for who
frink cocks the hammer
cary moves slowly toward frink
keep away from me
ill shoot i tell ya
frink and cary are less than a yard apart
frink drops the pistol his face twisted in pain
he starts to fall
nearby francis coolly fires his rifle pumping seven bullets into frink
members of the crowd scream in terror
instinctively shep still clutching his side and nikki each put a restraining hand on francis arm
francis lowers the rifle staring in horror and amazement at what hes just done
cary rushes over and pulls the rifle out of francis hands
francis snaps out of his trance as cary hurriedly returns the rifle to the gallery
shep and nikki watch stunned as francis immediately moves to cary and shakes his hand
francis turns to shep and nikki for equally heartfelt handshakes an odd look on his face
they realize he is saying a final goodbye
the crowd presses in as francis glances back at frink before turning and hurrying off
as a huge crowd rushes in the direction of the shooting gallery francis threads his way through it in the opposite direction and with only the briefest glance backward rounds
a corner to disappear behind a building
cary stares at frinks body as the gathering crowd streams into view then quickly starts to lead a shaken shep and nikki away from the shooting gallery
weve got to get out of here
come on shep
they slip through the thick fringe of excited people fast gathering in front of the shooting gallery and hurry off in the same direction as francis who is now on
a dark deserted street
distant crowd noise and carnival music drifts in
under the light of a street lamp on the edge of the carnival francis strolls casually into view and swings a leg over a slackly hung boundary rope pausing to
cary shep and nikki as they round the corner and pause a little breathless to lean against a wall
shep his fist still at his side slumps weakly as cary and nikki stare at
francis who briefly makes eye contact and then without a word turns steps over the rope and pulling his jacket collar up around his neck walks off instantly swallowed up
by the darkness
cary and nikki stare after him astonished
thats the last of francis im afraid
well never see him again
did you notice his eyes
thats the first time i ever saw francis really happy
whatll happen to him do you suppose
dont worry about francis
hell take care of himself
lets get out of here
shep leans weakly against the wall his eyes glassy
dont want to walk
lets take a cab
cary quickly moves to a signal a cab parked nearby
nikki rests a sympathetic hand on shep
as the cab jolts down an uneven street and drives slowly through the crowded carnival the music continues
cary and shep sit on either side of nikki
cary is as edgy as shep is subdued
did you see the way francis poured lead into that fellow
those slugs went right past my ear
if idve moved an inch i wouldve caught one of them myself
sudden death all right
nikki takes out a cigarette
whats the matter with you shep
ive never known you so quiet before
i am kind of quiet
holds her unlit cigarette not smoking
your lighter working
good ol nikki never has any matches
as shep puts his hand in his inside jacket pocket to pull out his cigarette lighter a strange look crosses his face
sure you want a light
thats what i want a light
shep pulls out the lighter and flicks it on revealing bloodstains on his white shirt
nikki stares down at the blood in horror
nikki jumps up and moves away from shep into a seat opposite
what is it
cary turns to shep who slumps back weakly against his seat with a strange look of release and satisfaction on his face
its a forgery
cary examines shep reaching in to feel his bloody wound
do something for him cary
hes been shot
what can we do cary
what can we do
shep why didnt you say you were hurt
good old cary
you may not believe it but this is the best thing that ever happened to me
oh shep shep dont say that
youll be all right
well get you to a hospital
shep puts a hand on carys arm as the taxi continues to jolt along down the street
no no cary
dont rush me anywheres
lets sit here for a while
the hurts the jolting
urgently cary reaches over and bangs on the glass between themselves and the cab driver
in front of the carnivals slowly revolving carousel the cab rolls to a stop
the carousel music drifts in
shep hardly moves head back blank eyes staring voice dreamy and weak
cary puts his face close to sheps listening intently
you know cary i feel just like were falling long time ago
do you remember
only you brought me down safe
good old cary
sighs best flyer in the service
nikki seated opposite is distraught
oh shepard shepard darling
reassuring were gonna make a safe landing again shep
not this time cary
ol sheps gonna crash
beat say but were spinning fast
cary level off
sheps head slumps down
his face presses against carys shoulder
oh shepard shepard darling
cary cant look at him
eyes wide cary slowly presses his cheek to sheps
cary looks as if he is on the verge of tears
and yet he cannot bring himself to cry
roar down a railroad track
nikki cranks her portable phonograph turns it on and puts the needle to the record tosellis serenade that strange sad composition that haunted europe at the close of the great
as the bittersweet romantic music plays she listens for a moment
then she turns and sidles over to sit next to cary who is seated by the window scribbling something on a piece of paper beside a small lamp
what are you writing cary
a letter to sheps mother
mind if i read it
nikki reads the letter silently
a long pause
cary thats the most beautiful letter ive ever read
nikki turns away and begins to cry quietly
please forgive me for crying cary
i cant help it
you dont mind if i cry just a minute do you
cary puts aside the letter
cant you cry cary
but you have cried sometime in your life havent you
long long time ago
before the war
and you cant cry now
not even for shep
shep lambert spent his life in the war
he had nothing more to give
he had died once
and he was ready to die again
this time he was played out with music
that was the way he wanted it
and bill talbot was a big success in the hospital in his new blue shorts
maybe hell tackle the angel gabriel and be a big success again
maybe francis will forget to wind his chiming watch one day and go on sleeping
till the end
it doesnt matter now
without them nothing matters
we only had each other
comradeship was all we had left
and now thats gone too
and you cary
youre alone now
im alone now
i dont want you to be alone cary
let me stay with you
let me be with you
he takes her hand looks at her affectionately
he kisses her hand
a strange apprehensive look crosses her face as she turns her hand over in his hands and opens it to reveal a heart shaped stone
cary looks at her in surprise
why nikki you kept it
you didnt forget
she lowers her eyes for a moment then looks at him
no harm can come to our true love
amused skeptical no harm can come to our true love
genuinely oh nikki youve become very dear to me
i want to help you
cant i do something for you too
what do you want
what can i get you
well ive always wanted a pair of spanish earrings
he gives her an uncomprehending look but then breaks into a smile as she buries her head lovingly in his shoulder
he kisses her hand again
in a dark bleak landscape as it chugs away down the track
