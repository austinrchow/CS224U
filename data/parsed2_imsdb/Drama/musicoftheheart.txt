a b w snapshot of roberta a nine year old girl playing violin in front of a refrigerator
roberta and her dashing italian father hand carving a wooden music stand
a b w snapshot of roberta in a communion dress
roberta at playing violin in front of the same refrigerator eyes on the music stand
a color photo of two cute blonde little boys building a sandcastle on a beach
a color photo of a groom in a white naval uniform and his pretty bride roberta at her hand over his as they cut their wedding cake with a sword
a color photo of roberta and her husband greek dancing with another couple at an outdoor taverna
robertas husband and the other mans sexy wife are exchanging a slight smile
hold on this last photo as we now see the album open on the floor of a bedroom as if its been tossed
we are wake up roberta
we hear the sound of knocking as the camera pans a small darkened guest room
a few streaks of daylight filter through venetian blinds
come on bert get out of bed
the camera finds a woman lying face down on a twin bed thick wavy hair sprawled across her shoulders
please bert you need to get out of that bed
the knocking continues and she puts the pillow over the top of her head
the woman roberta guaspari demetras retrieves the photo album from the floor looks at a photo and removes it
shes a beautiful woman with large expressive eyes but right now she looks like hell
she stares at the photo its the two couples dancing
a quick glimpse of hurt on her face then her jaw tightens and she rips the picture in half
theres muffled talking outside the door and then two young boys voices
can you come out now mommy
she puts the half with her and her husband on the dresser then tears the woman off the other half and rips her into pieces
mommy nick broke my crayon
well lexi hit me and he almost broke
he almost broke my ear
arguing i did not
yes you did
as if that one action siphoned all her energy roberta returns to bed gets into fetal position and stares at a point beyond the wall ignoring the o
your boys need you
assunta guaspari robertas slender tired italian american mother stands in the doorway of a well tended working class home addressing a young naval officer who holds a lengthy delivery inventory
its a gray day with ominous storm clouds
late s cars are parked on the street
but i have no room for this
im sorry mam
we have orders to deliver these
assunta looks beyond the man dismayed
large wooden crates cover her front lawn and two movers plant down another
they hurry back to the truck grabbing the next crate too quickly this time
it slips from their hands crashes to the ground and splinters open
several violin cases spill out
the crate looks like it holds a whole lot more
instantly a second story window is flung open and roberta sticks her head out a hundred times more energized than weve seen her so far
watch it you idiots
be careful with those
the men scramble to pick them up
assunta looks at all the violins then up at roberta
why so many
roberta disappears inside and slams the window shut
the living room is filled with boxes shipped from greece labelled by the u
and on the floor in the middle of the boxes are fifty violin cases of various sizes also with greek and u
nick and lexi climb over the boxes as if they were giant blocks
calling mommy which box has our toys
robertas on the phone yelling at someone
shes still in the same ratty nightgown
look i know hes there so quit lying to me
then check under lana holden mrs
just tell lieutenant demetras that his wife called and assunta grabs the phone from her hand and hangs it up
i want you to listen to me
you cant keep doing this to yourself or to the boys
they need their mother now
youre a beautiful talented woman and you have your whole life ahead of you
if im so beautiful and talented why did charles leave me
because charles is a big jerk
beat now get dressed
she exits leaving roberta to mull over her words
coffee is brewing and homemade cinnamon rolls are cooling on a rack
we recognize the kitchen from the home movie footage
as assunta clears the boys breakfast dishes from the table roberta enters
shes dressed but hasnt put on makeup or done much with her hair
its a start
you really think charles is a jerk
from the day you married him
why didnt you say something
since when do you listen to me
roberta half smiles pours herself some coffee then sits down at the table
sighs then what am i gonna do
first you eat breakfast
second you go out and get a job any job
your boys god bless em are good eaters but i cant afford it
mama hes gonna get tired of her youll see
assuntas face shows shes doubtful about this
well in the meantime get a job
roberta is behind the counter meticulously wrapping a present with ribbons bows and stickers
at one point she even unties a ribbon and redoes it because its not perfect
she looks pretty but shes dressed conservatively like a navy housewife
theres only one other clerk wrapping gifts and a long line of impatient customers
a male supervisor appears behind roberta
youre not picasso
he exits and roberta quickly tries to finish her task
picasso would probably put the bows on the back of the box
roberta looks up to find brian turner a handsome sexy guy with longish hair and a beat up leather jacket
i thought you moved away
im in town for my moms birthday
he holds out his hand
roberta misunderstands the gesture and tries to shake his hand
no thats her gift
roberta hands him the gift shes been wrapping
it looks very pretty
beat i heard you had a book published
i didnt read it but
my parents didnt read it either
it looks good on their coffee table though
so what are you doing here
i thought youd be in carnegie hall by now
hold on roberta as she takes this in
roberta sits opposite brian
her lunch is untouched
my college professors said it was too late i hadnt had enough training to be a concert violinist
so i got a teaching degree instead
ill bet youre a great teacher
i think i am
its just that
sighs see every time id get started somewhere charles would be transferred
then i had my kids and took time off to raise them
and then when i decided to teach again no one would hire me cause you cant count on a navy wife to stick around
i finally decided id start my own program charles gave me the money and i bought fifty violins from this little greek shop got started at a private school and
your husband ran off with your best friend
she wasnt my best friend
she was a friend
beat charles is the last person youd think would cheat on me he never broke a rule
a few beats i wake up one night its like one in the morning and hes not in bed
i go outside and our neighbor this old greek guy is sitting out there smoking a cigar so i ask if hes seen my husband
hes taking a walk with the other officers wife he says
he takes a walk every night with the other officers wife
a beat as she gets lost in the memory
she takes a bite of a french fry
god these are cold
so youre just gonna wrap presents and wait for him to come back
you sound like my mother
thats not very sexy
are you trying to be sexy or be my friend
a little of both
roberta smiles blushing a bit
brian looks at her getting an idea
you know i know this really cool lady who runs this elementary school i wrote a piece on her
its a public school but its alternative she might be able to create some kind of gig for you
let me give her a call
takes his last bite of sandwich if she hires you though you have to be willing to relocate
where is it
a salsa song plays over as we see stores with spanish names and signs black and latino elementary school children walking home from school some burned out buildings black and
latino teens playing basketball on a cement court spanish graffiti on walls elderly women buying fruit at a produce stand
pull back to reveal this is the pov of roberta from the back seat of a cab
the salsa song plays on the cabs radio
roberta looks scared shitless
suddenly two young men flash down the middle of the street dart in front of the cab and the driver slams on the brakes jerking roberta forward
welcome to east harlem
janet williams a black woman s with a kind face sits behind her desk and looks at robertas resume
a sign on her desk indicates that shes the director
also on the desk is a framed picture of janet her husband daughter and son
roberta sits nervously in the chair opposite her
looking at resume aside from half a term in a private school in greece and a year teaching chorus in hawaii ten years ago it doesnt look like youve had
any other teaching experience
well not traditional teaching experience
ive been doing private lessons
janet looks for this on the resume
its not on there
i taught my sons
janet smiles politely
id like to help you mrs
brian spoke highly of you and i told him id consider starting a violin class
but without the proper qualifications and without any experience in an inner city school
roberta nods defeated
im very sorry
roberta stands outside janets office dejectedly watching the children noisily running through the hall
roberta knocks on janets door
as roberta opens the door we see that nick and lexi are with her
all three have violins
inside janets in conversation with dennis rausch an uptight man with a tie that doesnt match his suit jacket
hes showing janet a large scheduling chart
im sorry to interrupt but i wanted you to meet my sons nick lexi
janet smiles at the boys but clearly thinks robertas a little off
roberta holds her hand out to dennis
roberta guaspari demetras
dennis shakes her hand regarding her warily
this is dennis rausch our music teacher and program coordinator
demetras didnt i make things clear yesterday
if i could just show you something itll only take a minute
before janet can answer roberta and the kids quickly take out their violins and get into position
janet and dennis exchange a look
are we having a talent show
i should have brought my tap shoes
roberta ignores the jab then nods to the boys
the three of them begin an incredibly impressive violin trio playing an etude in three part harmony
for the first measures janets still annoyed by the intrusion but shes quickly won over
dennis watches impassively
roberta and the boys finish their piece janet applauds and dennis joins in to be polite
the three take bows
will you hire her now
janet laughs then gestures for them to sit
how long have you boys been playing
since i was three
contemplates then maybe since i was three and a half
your mom must be a good teacher
shrugs shes o
roberta gives nick a look but janet smiles
to roberta if you could teach our students to play like that id be thrilled but i can
any child can learn the violin
assuming they had the discipline
ill teach them to have discipline
a lot of our parents are struggling to feed their kids and pay the rent they dont have time to help them learn violin
they dont have to
if they can help great but these kids will be committed
theyll practice on their own theyll help each other in the classroom dennis laughs
roberta looks at him a bit miffed
with an edge i think i know these students miss demetras
their attention span doesnt go past do re mi
maybe on a good day i can get them to fa
youre underestimating them
they can play as well as any other kids
that id like to see
janet observes the tension then turns to roberta
to roberta for now ill put you down as a sub but i have to warn you even if it works out the board may not let me create a
permanent position for you
ill worry about that later
with a grateful look thank you
we see relief and fear in robertas face
to janet well ive already planned out the whole term and i can tell you right now theres no room for this
besides where you gonna find money for violins
you need violins
in a noisy music room with bad acoustics roberta tries to take control of fifty kids third through fifth graders who are in a state of manic excitement over the
fifty violin cases on the floor
gently please do not open the cases o
they ignore her
look can everyone just settle down and listen to me please
angle three girls open their cases
starting to lose it keep them closed
angle two boys open their cases
to the boys did you hear what i just said
angle three kids are using the violin cases as pretend machine guns and shooting each other
put those down please
angle a boy and a girl are having a sword fight with their bows
to the fencers dont do that
put the bows back in the cases right now
theres the sound of violin strings being plucked
roberta wheels around to find a girl plucking her violin like a banjo and doing a little dance
this is lucy a skinny puerto rican girl in perpetual motion
what have i been saying
put that away
back in the case
roberta takes a breath
the kids settle down a bit
thats much better
takes another breath ill be dividing you into five classes but for today angle a boy plays bongos on his violin case
the bongo player stands
you will be the first student who will not be in my violin class
the child looks stunned
i said out
with a sheepish expression he exits
the room is finally quiet and robertas amazed that something worked
she puffs up a little bit enjoying the feeling of control
who else would like to be kicked out of my class
the students stare at her afraid of her now
de sean a small but tough black boy raises his hand
are you raising your hand because you want to be kicked out
i dont wanna learn no stupid violin
its for wimps
who told you that
i just know
whats your name
well de sean you havent given me a good enough reason so youre staying
she looks around the room
in front of the class roberta helps naeem a graceful black boy hold the violin
he has a serious expression and a scar on his left cheek
roberta controls the bow and fingerboard but it appears that the boy is playing music
hey i play pretty good
to naeem see how easy it is
to the class maybe in the spring we could have a big concert for your families and for the whole school
to the boy whats your name
roberta writes in a notebook and we see that shes measuring for violin sizes
to class if you listen to me and do exactly what i say youre gonna sound beautiful at the concert and youre gonna be so proud of yourselves
to naeem good naeem
your hands staying soft
to the class but if you dont listen to me youll sound so bad that your own parents will feel sick when they hear you
they might even throw up
on the kids not used to a teacher speaking like that
a funky apartment on the upper west side
nick and lexi are both asleep in sleeping bags on top of a futon on the floor their suitcases nearby
brian tiptoes past them carrying two glasses of champagne
he knocks on his office door
robertas in a bathrobe and nightgown some rollers in her hair
shes tidying up her suitcase etc
next to an old couch thats been made up as a bed
leftist political books line a shelf above brians desk including copies of his own to hell and back interviews with vietnam vets by brian turner
his desk is covered with files and books pertaining to migrant workers
referring to champagne whats this
its a toast
giving her a glass holding his up to roberta whos made it through her first week
they clink glasses and drink
i dont know brian
im hanging on by a thread there
out of fifty kids maybe six are listening to me
look at the progress
didnt you say no one was listening to you on monday
i really appreciate all youve done for us
and i promise this weekend ill start looking for a place
theres no rush
no weve put you out enough
youre supposed to be writing not babysitting for us
crosses to his desk flips through his vietnam book ive started your book
its very powerful
brian comes up behind her and starts to kiss her neck
robertas scared so she keeps talking as if its not really happening
so what made you choose migrant workers for your next book
i mean how do you know what to write about
kissing her neck i follow my gut pay attention to what im being drawn to
robertas aroused in spite of herself
she turns around and faces him
what are you doing
ive been waiting to do that since mr
baines orchestra class
you didnt even notice me
sure i did
you used to ignore me and it drove me wild
you had at least five different girlfriends
it didnt mean i had the one i wanted
he gives her a flirtatious smile then takes out one of her rollers
youre not a navy wife anymore
he moves to takes out another roller and roberta stops him
yes i am
and is it a navy requirement that you dress like its the s
i do not
goading her who did you vote for in the last election
what does that have to do with anything
hesitates then i dont know
charles filled out my absentee ballot
oh my god its even worse than i thought
touching her hair is this the same roberta who got the orchestra to strike until they gave us new uniforms
she laughs wistfully then looks a little sad
that robertas not around anymore
he pulls her towards him by the belt to her robe
i dont believe that
they kiss and it heats up quickly
roberta pulls back
the boys theyre sleeping
i know but
im still married
and whats your husband doing right now
a few beats and she moves towards him
sun streams into the room as roberta awakens in brians bed a look of afterglow on her face
she suddenly remembers where she is and quickly looks at the clock
oh shit the boys
theyre still sleeping
she turns relieved until she sees that brians packing a suitcase
where are you going
he dashes out
roberta sits up rattled by this news
brian excitedly gathers papers and files scattered around his electric typewriter
whats in texas
he turns to see roberta in the doorway
i just got the call it came through my research grant
it came through
isnt that great
he places items into a carry on bag packing at a rapid clip
in contrast roberta seems to be moving in slow motion
ive got a few families lined up there some in california how long will you be gone
two three months
brian throws toiletries into a plastic bag
i just thought you were gonna be around
and then last night he stops what hes doing and looks at her
roberta last night was great but did you think i was gonna marry you in the morning
of course not
we see in her face that part of her did think that
its just that
we just got here and were barely
i dont even know where to buy groceries
brian softens as he sees how vulnerable she is
he takes her in his arms
youre gonna be fine
you have a job a place to stay your kids have a school to go to and theres a dagostinos around the corner
she attempts a smile
he kisses her forehead then exits
hold on roberta looking hurt and frightened
roberta rosins her bow standing in front of ten kids third through fifth grade who sit on the floor next to their violin cases
the kids are black and latino with a couple of white faces
theyre all talking and ignoring roberta except for naeem and guadalupe a petite mexican girl with a long dark braid
note well see other violin students from time to time but this is the class well follow for robertas first year and what am i doing now
rosining the bow
and what am i doing when i turn this little screw
raising her voice everyone stop talking
the kids quiet down
only naeem raises his hand
tightening the horse hair
touches the heel of the bow and what do we call this
again only naeem raises his hand
roberta sees him but turns to de sean whos talking to his neighbor
what do we call this
i dont know
i wasnt here
yes you were but you werent paying attention
do you want people to think youre stupid
this makes de sean blush and it pisses him off
all right naeem tell them
its called the frog
some kids giggle and joke about this
roberta points to the scroll of the violin
anyone remember what this is
lucy the fidgety girl snaps her fingers
do you like people snapping their fingers when youre talking
the kids laugh
she points to the scroll
what is this called
the jeri curl
roberta laughs even though shes trying to be tough
denniss twenty students play recorder in rows of attached theatre style seats
dennis sits at his desk a metronome ticking and apathetically leads them in scales using a red pen as a baton
he keeps one eye on a stack of quizzes that hes marking stopping to circle mistakes with the pen
angle roberta stands in the hallway at the open door dismayed by dennis uninspired teaching
she enters and crosses to dennis speaking quietly to him
excuse me sorry to interrupt the students immediately start to chatter
he looks back at roberta annoyed by her intrusion
im supposed to take kids out of miss coopers classroom for my ten oclock class theres nobody there
miss coopers students have phys ed on tuesdays
but you scheduled them for violin
you must have read the schedule wrong
trying to remain polite i dont think so
well i cant solve this problem for you right now
nods to his class im trying to teach
so am i
lexi and nick are in brians bed
robertas tucking in lexi he holds a toy truck with greek writing on it
can i bring a puppy for show and tell tomorrow
honey we dont have a puppy
daddy said we could get one when we moved back to america
roberta looks at nick then turns back to lexi
how about your truck
ill bet youre the only one in school with a truck from greece
whens daddy coming back
roberta turns to nick and tucks him in
well hes still on his tour so well just have to see but
it shouldnt be too much longer
is he gonna live with us and brian
were just staying at brians house for a little while
she turns back to nick who looks worried
she kisses him
good night sweetie
she kisses lexi then reaches to turn off the lamp
leave it on
roberta nods smiles at her sons and exits
nine children stand violins under their right arms bows hanging down from their right hands and try to position their feet as roberta addresses them
now take the right foot and put it on a tile
now with the other foot take a tiny step forward and put it on a line
try to make a box with your feet she walks over to benjamin a white boy with glasses and corrects his feet
she sees lucy dancing in place
would you like to leave the class right now
lucy nods giggling
roberta walks down the row of students
you should feel very strong so strong and balanced that if i wanted to knock you over i couldnt
she crosses to tanisha a sweet natured black girl with her hair in tiny braids and gently pushes her belly
if youre standing strong i cant even push you
roberta turns to de sean whos talking to james a pudgy black puerto rican boy
as she crosses to another student does anyone know where naeem is
i saw him this morning but hes not here
yes i know hes not here thats why im asking
she gently pushes guadalupes belly
the girl stumbles back
see how i pushed you
it means your feet arent centered
guadalupe tries to correct her feet
roberta bends down to help and sees that the little girl wears leg braces under her pants
roberta stands and gestures to one of the boys
can you bring over a chair
to guadalupe its probably better for you to sit
the boy brings the chair
guadalupe sits embarrassed
roberta walks through a school yard filled with kids and parents picking them up
she sees naeem and crosses to him
where were you today naeem
i cant be in violin class anymore
my mother wont let me
naeems mother mrs
adisa steps into frame
shes an attractive black woman in a dress and head scarf made of african fabric
my sons got more important things to do than learn dead white mens music
theyre gonna learn twinkle twinkle little star
how many black classical composers can you name
how many black classical violinists do you know
that doesnt mean its the way it should be
naeems learning to play music and that makes him feel good about himself
why should it matter who wrote it
cant i be in the class
adisa puts a protective arm around her son then addresses roberta
ive seen this before
you white women come up here and think you can rescue our poor inner city children who never asked to be rescued in the first place
no thank you
she walks off with naeem
he glances back at roberta then turns away quickly
roberta watches after them
roberta attempts to read brians book to hell and back interviews with vietnam vets but shes distracted
she glances at her purse then back to the book
she puts the book down and dials the phone
brian turners room please
while she waits she looks at brians picture on the book jacket
theres no answer and she hangs up
she starts to straighten the already clean room then gets her purse takes out her wallet and opens it to the plastic covered pictures
charles in uniform a studio shot of the boys when they were and the whole family posed on the terrace of their home in greece a view of the ocean
shes really depressed herself now
alice crowley s a no nonsense black teacher shows her fifth graders a globe
she doesnt turn as roberta enters and crosses to her
in the b
we see robertas students waiting in the hall
and which ocean is this
kids simultaneously yell out atlantic and pacific
im here for the violin students
icy youre late
just a couple of minutes im sorry
theyre having a lesson now
but this is when they have violin class
thats not my problem
robertas reluctant to argue in front of the kids she exits
lots of noise and chaos as kids run wild during lunch recess
janet rushes through the throngs while roberta tries to keep up
i thought all the teachers agreed to this
to a student adam
i want you in my office right after lunch you understand
whatd i do
think about it
to roberta whenever you pull kids out its a disruption plus its extra work for the teacher cause they have to fill the kids in on what they missed
some teachers resent it
well cant you talk to them
janet stops walking and pulls a box cutter out of her pocket
i took this off a second grader this morning
ill help you roberta but i cant hold your hand here
janet starts to walk away then turns
a word of advice
when youre picking up your students go to alices classroom first
roberta stands there as janet walks on ahead
the nine children hold their violins in position as roberta addresses them
so pretend youre driving a car and im the policeman and i say stop
thumb up fingers straight up flat palm
now you be policemen but turn your hand and make it say stop to yourself
on the children attempting this
she walks around and helps
to himself youre under arrest
some kids crack up and start joking and chatting
knock it off de sean
to all if you kids cant take this seriously i dont want you here
im teaching you a difficult instrument because i respect you and have faith that you can learn it
but none of that matters if you dont have respect for yourself
some of the children think about what shes saying
a couple uncomfortable with the intensity hold back giggles
now turn your wrist so its flat against the fingerboard and thats how youll set up your hand
roberta sees guadalupe struggling
youve got the violin in the wrong hand
how did that happen
embarrassed guadalupe corrects her position
at the small kitchen table nick does homework and lexi puts stickers in a sticker book
robertas cooking dinner she grabs a potholder and checks on a bubbling lasagna in the oven
the phone rings and she answers it
her face falls as she hears the voice
she holds onto the counter to steady herself
where are you
calm detached im back in the states
im at my parents
roberta closes the oven and gathers her courage
are you still with her
we watch robertas body collapse into a sense of overwhelming relief
follow her as she steps into the hallway then stretches the phone into she half closes the door leans against the sink and starts to cry
through tears weve missed you so much charles
they cant wait for you to come home
i know well have a lot to work out and it wont be easy right away but were gonna get through this you know
were a family and we belong together and more emotive than before bobbi stop o
roberta looks as if shes been slapped
i want a divorce
but you said
you and lana
you said it was over
beat its over between us too bobbi
hold on roberta devastated
angle on nick watching her through the door
brians on the phone with roberta
hes in a t shirt and sweats and his papers are scattered on the bed
he wouldnt even talk about it
no explanations no discussion
roberta in brians living room
shes extremely agitated and her eyes are puffy from crying
i cant believe you were still holding out hope
the guy hasnt called you or the kids in three months i thought youd moved on
i never said that
maybe not with words
this embarrasses her then pisses her off
you know what
i shouldnt have called you
this was a mistake
no no im sorry
look i know it hurts but youre gonna get through this roberta you will
im moving back to my moms
youre gonna quit teaching in the middle of the term
i dont fit in there im not making any progress with the kids
what are you gonna tell janet your husband left you and nothing else matters
i dont know yet
roberta lies awake on the futon heartbroken
roberta stands and watches nick and lexi sleep
she lies down beside them and closes her eyes
roberta walks through crowds of kids towards janet whos in the middle of confronting a boy student
janet holds a fifty dollar bill
roberta hangs back and waits for a chance to speak
my mother gave it to me
why would she give you fifty dollars
to buy breakfast
janet gives him a stern look
do you know how hard your mother works
do you think its right for you steal from her
well lets go call her right now and ask her
as janet turns to walk off roberta crosses to her
i need to speak to you
itll have to wait
to the boy come on
in my office
roberta watches as janet dashes off with the boy in tow
guadalupe sits on a chair in the empty room struggling to set up her violin
roberta enters surprised to see her
what are you doing here
i cant get the stop sign
honey your teachers probably looking for you
guadalupe sighs then hands roberta the violin
i cant come anymore
its too hard
the violin is hard for everyone
but everyone else is better than me
ill always be slow
roberta looks at her sadly and puts the violin in its case
did you ever hear of itzhak perlman
hes one of the greatest violinists in the world and he has problems with his legs too
he walks with two canes but he still makes the most beautiful music
and he sits down when he plays
he has to
guadalupe takes this in
he was your student
but if he was id tell him the same thing im telling you
you shouldnt quit something just because its hard
but i cant stand strong
standing strong doesnt only mean using your legs
you can stand strong on the inside too
beat know what i mean
roberta holds out the violin case
guadalupe lunges forward and hugs her around the waist
roberta awkwardly accepts the hug startled and touched by it and strokes the girls hair
guadalupe lets go takes the violin and exits
hold on roberta as she absorbs what just happened
janet pokes her head into the room
you wanted to speak to me
umm thats o
its taken care of
janet looks at her curiously then exits
roberta walks around an empty rundown apartment her expression somber
crayon markings on the walls cigarette burns on the floors a filthy bathroom and kitchen
an older puerto rican woman stands back as roberta inspects the place
roberta wipes grease off one of the windows
is just for you and your boys
roberta enters the yard from inside the school
its filled with kids playing including nick and lexi
she waves to them and lexi runs up to her carrying a piece of artwork
look what i made you mommy
he gives her a tempera painting of a mans face the background decorated with glued on macaroni
it says daddy
covering her discomfort that is so beautiful
he runs off
roberta exhales sits down alone on a bench and takes out her lunch
she smiles at alice crowley and another teacher but they cross to another bench
isabel vasquez approaches a lively puerto rican woman with a strong new york accent
whatsa matter you got cooties
ill take my chances
extends a hand isabel vasquez
im the violin teacher
she sits down beside roberta takes out her lunch
is it my imagination or does everyone hate me
its hard to fit in when youre doing a special program
people figure youre not gonna be here very long so why make the effort
beat it may take a while for folks to warm up but nobody hates you
sotto what about alice crowley
sotto a she thinks the violins a waste of time
and b shes a bitch
and then theres dennis
the music man
youve had the bodacity to threaten his private little empire not to mention the fact that you messed up his sacred scheduling chart
how come youre being nice to me
i want my daughter in your class next year
if im here next year
you will be
lexis painting is on the wall along with a crayon drawing of himself roberta and nick in front of a house
angle roberta looks out the window
shes gotten some used furniture cleaned the place and its less depressing
on the street below three prostitutes stand at the corner
two men sit on a stoop smoking a joint and in a parked car three men seem to be making a drug deal
one of the buildings on the street is burned out missing a front door
nick in his pajamas enters and crosses to his mother
she smiles at him and they both look out the window
in greece we could see the ocean
and the fishing boats
and the octopuses
roberta smiles and puts her arm around him
is daddy coming here soon
roberta tenses up
well thats something ive been wanting to talk to you about
daddys not gonna live with us anymore
you and lexi will have special times when you stay with him like at christmas
can you tell the birthday story
roberta looks at him concerned that hes not responding to her news
dont you want to talk about what i told you
i want to hear the birthday story
a beat as she contemplates whether to push or not then it was the day of grandpas birthday and i was sad because he had died a few months back
but you knew id be born that day
so i packed a bag and got all ready and daddy laughed
i said its my fathers birthday and the babys gonna be born today
he didnt believe you
but i was born
the same day as grandpa
it was a happy day
was daddy happy too
she looks at him taken aback by the question
of course he was
then why is he leaving me
roberta overcome with emotion can barely answer
hes not leaving you nick
he loves you and lexi very much
then why cant he live here
struggling its very hard to explain
sometimes things happen between grown ups
and they just cant be together
the camera moves behind them as they continue to look out the window and we see nick move away from his mother
the kids play twinkle twinkle little star and they sound awful
roberta looks disgusted as she leads them
to de sean how much did you practice this week
my asthma it was very bad and i had to go to the hospital
you told me you went to the hospital last week
maybe it was last week
roberta rolls her eyes then turns to lucy
lucy you sounded the worst of all
have you practiced
you cant be in this class if you dont practice
my grandma got mugged
is she o
roberta stands there sobered
im really sorry lucy
tries to get her bearings just do the best you can
a group of kids stand together with their violins and chat
roberta exits the building and they greet her
she waves back but shes clearly still upset by her interaction with lucy
she sees naeem and his mother and approaches them
can i talk to your mom for a minute
naeem nods and moves off
look i didnt come up here to rescue anybody
im a single mother and i needed a job
and i know you think youre protecting your son but youre not
i mean what if arthur ashes mother had stopped him from playing tennis because its a white mans game
beat the important thing is that when naeem plays music his whole face lights up
you should see him
adisa takes this in
adisa looks for naeem and sees him watching the violin students longing to be among them
she watches her son with compassion
roberta and the boys shop in a colorful outdoor produce market in their neighborhood
the boys suddenly rush over to a man sitting on the ground with mixed breed puppies in a cardboard box
the boys pet them excitedly
roberta watches her sons theyre happier than shes seen them in ages
a brown puppy is jumping all over nick and lexi who laugh delightedly
roberta is putting down newspapers
we all have to take turns cleaning up o
the boys are oblivious to her theyre in heaven
to herself yeah right
robertas screaming at the kids as they play twinkle twinkle little star
first finger on the e
three two one open
to a white girl with pigtails wrong string becky
weve done this fourteen times
and look at your nails
youre supposed to cut them for violin class
k everybody stop
it sounds horrible
i cant believe how bad it sounds
they stop playing
tanisha raises her hand
is this an important question tanisha
do you have two of those skirts
you wore a skirt just like it on monday
some of the kids crack up
you know tanisha i dont think thats such an important question
to class o
lets try the door opens and naeem enters with mrs
roberta crosses to them
naeem and i were wondering if he could still be in the class
id love that
to naeem youll have a lot of catching up to do
you think you can work that hard
yeah i can
maybe we can also arrange some private lessons at my house
i wouldnt have the money for that
to naeem why dont you go grab one of my spare violins
naeem happily runs to the extra violins at the front of the room mrs
adisa nods to roberta with a look of gratitude then exits
roberta crosses back to the front of the room
to class lets try it again
they begin again and we see naeem take out a violin and join in
as they play robertas ears perk up at something shes hearing
she crosses to lucy
what are you playing
to class everyone stop
to lucy let me hear
lucy hesitates thinking shes in trouble
she plays a jazz variation of the song
did someone teach you that
i made it up
thats really great lucy
im proud of you
to class all of you try it
the class plays lucys jazz variation and naeem happily joins in
roberta sits opposite janet and mrs
lamb a white woman in her s
youre shouting at them
all the time
not all the time
but if they dont listen didnt you tell them that they were making their parents sick
janet raises her eyebrows at this
that wasnt exactly what i said im raising becky in a supportive atmosphere
i dont send her to school to be abused
im just trying to discipline them
if theyre gonna learn an instrument they need to take it seriously i think what mrs
lamb is trying to say roberta is that youre a little too harsh
im sure you might be able to soften some of your comments to the children
she gives roberta a long hard look
roberta listens to the students play go tell aunt rhody badly
they finish and stare at her afraid of her response
well that was
that was pretty good
that wasnt too bad
they look at her in disbelief then look at each other
i thought we stunk
i wouldnt put it that way
you all just need to practice a bit more
to james james have you practiced this week
the boy nervously shakes his head no
can you please try a little harder for next week
the kids are baffled by her politeness
just do the best you can
why you acting like that
dont you want a nice teacher
i already got nice teachers
you added some variety
we like you better the way you used to be
to becky what about you becky
this is even worse
youre acting weird now
well then i take it back
you all stunk
the kids laugh
but dont tell your parents i said so
the kids laugh again
christmas muzak plays in the b
as roberta kisses and hugs lexi and nick goodbye
a flight attendant stands nearby
cant you come with us
honey i told you
this is daddys special time with you
lexi looks upset nick is stoic
roberta hugs them one last time
the flight attendant steps forward
ill take good care of them
the flight attendant escorts them into the jet way
roberta holds back tears as they get further away from her
at the last moment lexi turns and waves nick does not
roberta waves tears starting to fall and the boys disappear from sight
she observes all the families travelling together and feels like the loneliest person in the airport
roberta enters her apartment back from the airport and double locks the door behind her
you can see on her face that shes dreading the emptiness
she crosses to a small christmas tree obviously decorated by her and the boys and plugs in the tiny blinking lights
its not exactly rockefeller center
she turns on the t
playing its a she crosses to the kitchen then returns with a carton of eggnog a glass and a bottle of rum
she sits down on the couch pours herself some eggnog adds rum adds more rum goes back into the kitchen returns with nutmeg sprinkles some on top then drinks
she sighs glancing miserably at the tree and the t
she couldnt look any less festive if she tried
theres a knock on the door
roberta gets up and warily approaches the door
who is it
she looks through the peephole then quickly unlocks the door and opens it revealing brian giving her a big smile
he looks sexy as hell even with a silly lit up santa claus pin on his leather jacket and he holds a long stemmed red rose in one hand and
a christmas present in the other
robertas thrilled and relieved to see him
she embraces him and they kiss passionately
close on plaster walls being knocked down with sledgehammers
reveal brian roberta and a couple of workmen knocking down the walls in an old brownstone
a mild winter day
roberta covered with plaster dust and overheated from working leans against a car and drinks a beer
the three story brick building has some graffiti on it and is badly in need of a paint job there are a few broken windows and the front stairs need
workmen file in and out
we can see from the street signs that were on th street a few houses off first avenue
brian also dust covered nick and lexi toss around a football
lawrence a black boy who lives next door joins them
brian crosses to roberta sweaty and out of breath
he takes a swig of her beer
enough goofing off back to work
you trying to kill me
she laughs and they kiss
assunta comes up the street with a bag of take out food
she casts a dubious glance at the lovers
i was the only person in the whole coffee shop not speaking spanish
roberta rolls her eyes
a car backfires
you hear that
how you gonna live here by yourself
calling boys come eat
i work in this neighborhood mama
i want to live here
the boys approach and assunta hands them sandwiches
lawrence hangs back
assunta calls to him
whats your name
you hungry lawrence
lawrence nods and she hands him a sandwich
roberta smiles at her mothers gesture
the kids move off to lawrences front steps and assunta gives roberta and brian sandwiches
to brian why did you let her buy this house
hey your daughter does what she wants or havent you noticed
robert washes dishes and assunta dries
the leftovers from an italian dinner are on the counter
i still dont understand the rush
having my own place will make me feel like im really starting my life again
but if you invested your divorce settlement you could buy something nice someday
its bad enough that youve been renting in this neighborhood but to lock yourself into a mortgage snapping mama please
assunta backs off
roberta feels guilty and moves to her
dont worry o
besides if things keep going well im sure eventually brian will move in with us
a few beats
how much do you know about this man
brians a good person hes helped me a lot hes great with the boys since he got back to town its been really sweet
with an attitude and how long has he been back
thats not very long
dont make the same mistake twice bert
you barely knew charles when you married him
defensive i dont get it youre ragging on me about buying the house i would think youd want brian to live with me
not if hes the wrong person
roberta locks her jaw not wanting to believe that shes right
the kids play allegro roberta leading them
get ready now were coming up to the fermata
they reach a certain note then pause
dont anybody move
now at the spring concert the audience is gonna be dying for that next note but well make them wait
as a matter of fact i think ill go grab a cup of coffee
she starts for the door and the kids moan and groan come on roberta
roberta get back here
but you have to promise youll all start together
they begin again all at different times
well never get that right
thats not a very nice thing to say about your classmates
to class how many people think they can get it right by the concert
all the kids raise their hands
de sean looks around embarrassed then raises his too
brian and roberta finish making love on the futon
they lie in each others arms still breathing heavily
i love you
brian makes a sound thats either panting or laughing
did you just laugh
roberta looks at him offended
why do people feel like the minute somethings going great they gotta name it
beat once you name something you snuff the life out of it
she disentangles from him
do you still get away with that crap
its not the sixties anymore
well maybe if youd actually gone through the sixties youd know what im talking about
we wont name it we wont talk about it well act like we have no feelings for each other whatsoever
she angrily turns on her side with her back to him
brian regrets hurting her and moves to her kissing her shoulder
im being an asshole
sweetly teasing you can say you love me if you want
i changed my mind
he laughs and coaxes her to kiss him a temporary truce
ernie s a rickety black man in work boots looks baffled by a tangled mess of wires protruding from a wall
hows it coming ernie
well if i could just remember what i did here yesterday id be moving a whole lot faster
beat you look real pretty today honey
brian overhears rolls his eyes and pulls her aside
why did you hire him
he needed a job
besides hes wired all of east harlem
fifty years ago
brian sighs and walks off into another room
two men carry in large panels of sheetrock with old wallpaper on it
why is there wallpaper on it
thats how it comes
they lean the panels against a wall
roberta turns to ernie
yep thats how it comes now
the guys quickly exit
brian re enters and sees the panels
what the hell is this
youve gotta be kidding
those ex cons you hired ripped this off and you too
roberta feels stupid but doesnt want to show it
look this house is taking every penny of my settlement
i cant afford fancy union workers
throwing up his hands fine
do it your way
he stomps off
another angle nick watches them fight and looks distressed
lots of screaming and commotion as the kids crowd around a fight in progress
as we move through the crowd we see that nicks in a fight with another boy nicks nose is bleeding and he has the boy in a headlock
two teachers run over to break it up
nick sits outside holding an ice pack to his bloody nose
roberta stands opposite janet
im giving him a two day suspension but next time hell be expelled
there wont be a next time i promise
have you noticed your son lately
hes tied up in knots and he needs help
janet kids fight
youre making too much of this
he was choking the kid
beat nicks in trouble roberta
you need to deal with it
roberta takes this in upset
roberta plays go tell aunt rhody with guadalupe de sean naeem benjamin and two kids from the other classes
lexi plays along with them
nick enters from the kitchen eating a cookie ignoring the students
he turns on the t
to students keep playing guys
roberta crosses to nick and shuts off the t
you can watch when were done
its my house
they dont live here i do
sotto nick honey the kids are real nervous about the spring concert
you could probably give them some pointers
i dont feel like it
he reaches for the t
dial and she stops him
i said no
she crosses back to her students nick turns on the t
brian nick and lexi laugh as they play frisbee alongside a duck pond
roberta watches relieved to see nick enjoying himself
good catch nick
nick throws it back to brian and it lands in the water
mock sternly uh oh
you know what that means
he stalks towards nick menacingly picks him up and pretends hes going to throw him into the water
nick laughs hysterically
through laughter dont
dont throw me in
afraid of a little water
the ducks arent afraid
are you a chicken or a duck
dont throw me
looks like you got yourself a chicken roberta
im not a chicken
well then you must be a duck
he pretends again to throw nick in then puts him down
lexi holds out his arms to brian
throw me in the water brian
do it to me
brian swoops him up and lexi starts laughing
roberta laughs along happy to see the affection between brian and her sons
brian and roberta speak as they stroll the boys run ahead of them dragging sticks along the pavement
in the b
we see harlem streets bordering the park
you seem to be the only one who can get nick to laugh these days
he misses his dad
im just a surrogate
no i think nick really likes you
taking his arm you know
were all hoping youll move into the new house with us
can we just slow down here a minute
its too much like getting married
whats so bad about that
that kind of commitment just isnt realistic
i mean how can we know that you and i will even be able to stand each other in five years
well we dont
but if two people care about each other they take a chance
and look what happened to you and charles
im not talking about charles
im talking about us
marriage is based on a belief that one person can completely meet another persons needs
i just dont buy that
this is making her nervous
she looks at him afraid of what he might be saying
carefully what are you saying
if theres some need you have that i dont meet youd go and get it met by someone else
he heaves a sigh of frustration not wanting to answer the question
im saying that its the s and its a fantasy to think of marriage lasting these days
one out of two marriages ends in divorce
you didnt answer my question
beat if i dont meet all your needs and were in a committed relationship forget marriage for a minute im just talking about a relationship would you go to someone
in theory yes
roberta looks very disheartened
brian feels badly
roberta weve got something good right now thats the important thing
lets just keep it that way he pulls her to him kissing her neck but she pulls away from him
on nick observing with an anxious expression
whining why cant he
roberta looks distressed by her talk with brian as she and the boys enter back from the park
he just cant o
brians at his house tonight and were at ours
well then i wanna go to his house
now why dont you and your brother practice while i make dinner
i dont feel like practicing
well do it anyway
i wanna go to brians
stop whining and get your violin
nick stomps off to get his violin
roberta puts down her bag and takes off her coat
while lexi sets up his violin nick opens his violin case takes out the violin and angrily starts playing loudly and roughly
what the hell are you doing
the problem with you is youre mean to everybody and then they dont want to be with you
ive heard just about enough from you young man
now set your violin up properly and start practicing
nick throws the violin against the floor
i hate the violin
you pick that violin up right now and dont you ever ever nick picks up the violin and throws the violin down even harder then yells at roberta before she
can even respond
its all your fault
you made daddy leave and youre gonna make brian leave too
youre gonna be all alone and ill have to take care of you
roberta is stunned
the anger drains out of her as she suddenly sees what this is all about
nick you dont have to take care of me
then whos going to
ill take care of myself and ill take care of you and lexi
you didnt try hard enough
you made daddy leave us
this hits her in the solar plexus
her hurt and vulnerability start to pour out
thats not true
i begged him not to leave but he didnt listen
roberta hesitates but knows she has to tell them the truth
she addresses both boys
your father met someone he liked more than mommy and then who
roberta swallows shocked to hear him ask this
she can hardly answer him
remember our friends lana and tom
is he gonna marry her now
no but hes not coming back
nick and lexi look very upset not only from hearing the finality in her words but from seeing their mothers pain
roberta moves closer to them
ill take care of you nick
you too lexi
im not going anywhere
were still a family
nick starts crying
roberta takes him in her arms
lexi starts to cry and roberta holds him too
softly to both i promise
ernies radio plays a blues song
the brick workers radio plays spanish music and the painters radio plays a rap song
roberta stands in the middle about to lose her mind
her pov ernie sits on a stool facing his wiring
hes fast asleep
another angle the brick workers build a crooked fireplace
roberta sighs heavily then crosses to the painters
what color is this
i told you eggshell
eggshells are white
brian watches this interaction as he sands a door
youre an idiot
i told you you cant be your own contractor
im an idiot
she crosses to ernie and shakes him
wake up ernie
he looks at her groggily
she crosses to the brick workers
she crosses to the painters
brian smiles at her impressed
thats more like it
youre fired too
i mean it
i need to be with a man who can make a commitment to me
i need that and my sons need that
beat so can you
hesitates then roberta his tone and expression tell her the words are not forthcoming
he looks at her shocked by her toughness but knows he cant give her what she wants
roberta stands in the middle of the room a determined look on her face
stands in the aisle leading the students and playing violin
the fifty fifth grade students play the twinkle variations
their playing is impeccable and they look terrific
as the camera pans the audience we recognize mrs
adisa tears in her eyes as she watches naeem mrs
lamb and her husband watching becky in amazement isabel and her daughter sitting with assunta nick and lexi janet impressed as hell and dennis seething with jealousy
as the kids start the jazz variation of twinkle a woman elbows her husband thats the one lucy wrote
the camera returns to the children and captures their own pride in their playing including lucy who smiles as she hears her song played by fifty
the students are now playing allegro and they reach the fermata
they hold their positions in silence and the audience watches in anticipation
roberta cues them and they play the next note in perfect unison
an involuntary smile lights on de seans face
they finish the song the audience applauds and roberta turns to face them
she lights up when she sees how thrilled janet looks and janet in turn raises her hands higher as she applauds roberta
the side of the building now has an impressive mural an urban landscape with three super heroes puerto rican black and white rising up out of the street
it reads roberta stands in front of a classroom of twenty cute first graders mostly black and latino a few white sitting on the floor chatting excitedly
even though robertas ten years older she seems more youthful her wavy hair is loose over her shoulders her clothings casual and artistic
beside her is janet her hair flecked with gray and dennis who looks pretty much the same
the classroom teacher is isabel a little older a little tougher
cmon everybody settle down janet wants to talk to you
todays a very special day because were starting the tenth year of the east harlem violin program
this is a wonderful opportunity for you so i want you to talk to your parents about whether youd like to try this
my daughter took violin with roberta when she was your age and now shes in high school and she still talks about how much she loved it
janet and i started this program because we knew how much you kids could benefit from it
cutaway to roberta and janet exchanging glances over dennis taking credit for the program
you should know however that the violin is a difficult instrument
justin a black boy with attitude raises his hand
he always wears a puffy red yellow and green crocheted beret
isabel nods to him
whos that lady in the back
angle dorothea doro taya van hauften s an elegant beautiful woman smartly dressed takes photographs from the back of the room
thats dorothea van hauften say what
what kinda name is that
and shes taking pictures of robertas classes for a magazine article about music education
i wanna be in the magazine

robertas gonna explain to you about the lottery
roberta steps forward
ramon olivas a small adorable puerto rican boy with a crew cut watches her with adoration
i used to just teach fifty kids at this school
but now i teach a hundred and fifty kids at three east harlem schools and theres so many children who want to take violin classes that we have to have
vanessa raises her hand a white girl whose clothes and accessories are always adorned with cats

robertas explaining that

angle ramon listens intently with his fingers crossed
so everyone bring in your slips by friday and ill come back and tell you whos in violin class

it doesnt mean that anyones better than anyone else
ramon raises his hand
to roberta i really really hope that i get in the class
roberta looks at him struck by his sweetness
i hope so too
the brownstone looks a lot better than when we last saw it
graffitis been removed the stairs have been repaired the windows have security bars and there are flowers blooming in pots in front of the building
roberta steps into frame walking allegra now a year old dog
the house is transformed the first floor is one long open room with oak floors a living room in front with a beautiful fireplace and a grand piano and a
country kitchen in the rear complete with pots hanging over a large butcher block
nick practices cello and lexi practices piano they play haydns trio
now handsome young men their blonde hair has darkened to brown
nick is huskier lexi has a slighter build
both are passionate talented musicians
on the couch rachel a mature beautiful black girl rosins her bow
how come you guys dont play the violin
well picture her being your teacher and your mother
rachel cracks up but stifles her laughter as roberta enters from outside with allegra
be right with you
as roberta removes allegras leash rachel and lexi share a conspiratorial look
in the b
nick packs up his cello
to nick youre gonna practice upstairs
youve barely practiced
what are you timing me with a stop watch
why dont you pick on lexi for a change
cause im perfect
nick jostles him and heads upstairs
lexi gets up from the piano
to rachel have a good lesson
he crosses to a sharp looking bike parked behind the front door and addresses roberta
ill be back in a couple of hours
lexi mouths be careful along with her
lexi plays basketball with a group of black and latino guys
despite his small stature hes a great athlete and an accepted part of the group
the game ends
he and his buddy lawrence now both all sweaty cross to a water fountain
as lexi takes a drink can i try your bike
lexi wipes his mouth and looks up at henry a tall intimidating black teenager who towers over him
lawrence watches tensely
im gonna be leaving pretty soon
just wanna take it for a spin
cmon henry he dont want to loan you his bike
i didnt hear him say that
to lexi is that true

lexi looks at him knowing theres only one right answer
roberta and rachel play bachs minuet one together on the violin
the girl has obvious talent
dont wiggle your wrist
rachel stops frustrated
i cant get that right
you almost have it
almost isnt good enough
did i turn you into such a perfectionist
i came that way
smiles then just as long as you get it right for your julliard audition
ive recommended you for a gifted kids scholarship
rachel looks at her in wide eyed gratitude
angle lexi enters the front door a glum look on his face
wheres the bike
roberta drives with nick in the front lexi and lawrence in the back
theyre in a dangerous looking part of east harlem
dont do this to me
cmon mom why dont you let me handle this

or well ask dad hell help us out
its the second one on the right
roberta slows the car down next to a housing project
not a place youd want to go into even in the day time
pull back to reveal this is their pov from inside the car
the boys look frightened but robertas on a mission
cmon mom lets get out of here
lock the doors
and she exits
the boys watch as she heads for the building then lexi shakes his head and covers his face
shes gonna get me killed
nick jumps out of the car and heads after her
im coming with you
get back in the car and stay with the boys
nick hesitates and heads back
roberta presses on
lawrence opens the window and calls to her
dont take the stairs
close on the elevator door with a handwritten sign that reads wider roberta stands in front of the elevator staring tensely at the sign
she takes a deep breath then heads for the staircase
roberta climbs the dimly lit stairs of a dilapidated scary building
a baby cries a couple of tvs blare
at the top of the stairs roberta turns down the hall passing a door riddled with bullet holes
she finds the apartment and knocks
she knocks again
im a school teacher
henry has taken my sons bicycle and i want it back
a beat then the door cracks open an old woman visible through the chain lock
henrys not here
well you tell henry that if he returns the bike i wont have to notify the police or his school principal
although since i am a teacher it would be very easy for me to do that
a couple of beats
hes not home
he doesnt get home till late
not till after ten
ill be on the steps of cpe at p
ill be waiting for him
the door closes
did she just do that
roberta nick lexi and lawrence sit on the front steps of the school
the street is deserted
hes not gonna show
roberta sits confidently
you think he actually cares that youre a teacher
you think he even goes to school
cmon mom lets just go
its only five after eleven
nick and lexi roll their eyes and exchange a look shes nuts
suddenly theres the sound of a bicycle
nick lexi and lawrence look towards the sound incredulous
henry rides up on the bike and dismounts
lexi looks directly at him as he takes the bike from him
i was just borrowing it
he glances at roberta then walks off
roberta stands in front of isabels class and calls out names handing the selected children acceptance letters
the kids are charged up my heart is pounding
please pick me
a pretty black girl with braids and tons of barrettes jumps up and down then runs up for her letter
the kids squeal and cheer for each student called
shandra hugs her best friend myesha a chubby black girl who also holds a letter
justin raises his fists in triumph
angle ramon anxiously waits to see if his name will be called
justin sits down next to him waves his letter in ramons face taunting him
vanessa takes her letter and smiles
she puts it into her cat shaped backpack

ramon crosses his fingers and holds his breath
ramon looks crushed
justin taunts him some more
leonard a scrawny white boy takes his letter scared by it
he starts to cry
its too hard
i dont wanna do it

through tears i dont want to
isabel looks at roberta
ill pick someone else
she picks a name ramon olivas
ramons face lights up
as roberta walks through the yard she sees kids excitedly showing acceptance letters to their moms
shandra and myesha hold hands as they run to shandras mom beverly wilson pushing a stroller
she looks at the letter and hugs shandra
angle ramon reads his letter to his mother concepcion whose eyes tell you that shes lived through a lot
she speaks with a puerto rican accent
this is to inform you that your child ramon olivas has been chosen by lottery to be in the violin program
ramon spins round and round with the letter in his hand
i think youre happy
roberta illegally parks her old honda rushes out of the car grabs her book bags and three violins pulls a parking ticket from her pocket and puts it on the
german accent does that really work
its dorothea the photographer we saw in the classroom
but i keep trying
and maybe someday the school will give me a parking space
she rushes towards the school and dorothea follows her
wait she hands roberta a thin box
roberta puts down her violins glances inside it and forgets about being late
terrific black and white shots of robertas advanced classes playing violin
god these are great
those copies are for you

besides youll need your money for parking tickets
they smile at each other

she glances at stephanie a white girl with red hair next to kenny a black boy with an earnest expression
your stop sign has to be up kenny
stephanie it doesnt look like you ever had a lesson with me
carlos hurries in a handsome black boy in a baseball jacket that says los leones
wheres your violin carlos
he nervously looks down the hall
what is it walking here by itself
a black third grade girl rushes into the room and hands carlos his violin then runs off
roberta crosses to carlos as he quickly readies the violin
your buddies giving you a hard time

because lately thats how it sounds
ive been busy
ive been im not interested
just get here on time and commit to this class or i dont want you in here you understand
he nods sullenly
youre a good violinist carlos and its definitely not cool to waste your own talent
carlos takes this in as roberta crosses to another student
its upstairs from a grocery store on a busy street
ramon sits on the floor upset half heartedly building with legos while his parents argue in the kitchen
his father manuelo is a stocky muscular man
intercut between the two areas
this is a modest well kept apartment
off the kitchen religious candles burn on a shelf above a washing machine
why didnt you show it to me
it just needed one parents signature
with some spanish well im his parent and i dont give permission
he should be playing baseball not the violin
it makes him happy
on ramon looking far from happy at the moment
rachel steps off a city bus carrying her violin
she passes two sixth grade boys and a girl
loudly ooh check out little miss violinhead
she carry that violin with her all the time cause she think she special
rachel turns to them
i am special
she proudly continues on then sees roberta walking towards the school and catches up to her
nonchalant so i heard from julliard
roberta stops and looks at her
they said yes
roberta gives her a big hug
on the beginners class including ramon as they play lightly row
roberta walks around making corrections as she addresses the students
she doesnt see justin poking ramon with his bow ramon swats the bow away and glares at his nemesis
roberta moves some of shandras braids away from the violin
so when you take the violins home tape your music to the wall directly in front of your nose so you can play with perfect posture
your parents are gonna be so excited to hear you play
screeching comes from ramons room as he practices lightly row
his brothers pedro and ernesto cringe as they try to watch t
ernesto gives up and puts on his walkman pedros ready to break the violin
concepcion listens patiently as she folds laundry but even she winces
how many cats you killing in there
intercut ramon he plays with pride eyes on the music taped to the wall
on ramon his improved playing showing that time has passed
wider the beginners class plays lightly row
justin is struggling more than the other students
roberta plays along with the class eyeing each student
to the frog
myesha your stop sign line should be touching
dont let it wiggle
youre on the wrong string justin
and look at your feet
vanessa enters the front door without her violin
wheres your violin
and you may be dropped
vanessa pouts and exits
roberta moves to rosario a puerto rican girl
look at those nails rosario
she pulls a clipper from her pocket and swiftly clips them
myesha nervously glances at her own nails
i see you over there myesha
she moves to ramon and corrects his bowing position
to ramon youre doing much better
as roberta walks on to the next student justin purposely knocks over ramons music stand
drop dead justin
it was a accident
ramon i dont like that kind of talk
justin pick up his stand now
our spring concert is in three weeks and you might not be in it
is that what you want
as roberta heads for her car she sees vanessa being helped into a car by her father his suit wrinkled and tie loosened
theres snow on the ground
im gonna have to drop vanessa from the class if she keeps forgetting her violin
sotto shes going back and forth between houses
my wife and i split up
roberta leans into the car window
vanessa maybe you could write down for your mom and dad which days are violin days
almost in tears the tape doesnt stick
i taped the music to the wall at my moms house and then i took it to my dads house and it doesnt stick anymore
kleins eyes tear up and he quickly wipes them
well you know what
thats an easy problem to solve
she looks through her book bag takes out a piece of music and gives it to her
now you have two o
one for each house
vanessa nods clutching the piece of music
roberta and mr
klein exchange a look
she touches his arm then walks off
ramon holding his bow and violin crosses to his father whos watching a baseball game on t
you wanna hear my new song papa
in spanish not right now
ramon exits hurt
concepcion watches from the side and crosses to her husband
we made mistakes with pedro and ernesto and we cant fix them now but ramon he works so hard
the violin makes him want to be good at everything
he shows no response and she exits
manuelo ponders what she said
roberta approaches the school on a winter morning
she smiles as she sees vanessa get out of her mothers car with her violin
roberta nears the front door and finds isabel and some teachers huddled in conversation
a few students are crying
to isabel what happened
the beginners sit on the floor and rosin their bows
a few chat but its quieter than usual except for ramon who is blessing kids with his violin bow
you go to heaven
you go to hell
you go to hell
roberta enters slowly
she looks very shaken up
she takes note of what ramon is doing and overhears toussaint and shandra in mid conversation
my grandpa died and my uncle so that makes six
i know more than that
at least seven people
maybe even nine
roberta gently tells ramon to sit and then she sits down on a child sized chair in front of them
quietly i know that youve all heard the bad news about justin
i didnt hear
there was a drive by shooting by his house and he got shot on accident and he died
myesha takes this in looking sad
does anyone want to talk about it
angry i think we should just play violin
roberta watches him
concepcion cooks chicken and pedro sets the table whistling along to ramons o
violin playing we shall overcome
theres a knock on the door
concepcion answers it revealing roberta
i came by to check on ramon
didnt he tell you what happened at school
concepcion shakes her head no
ramon is still playing violin as concepcion and roberta enter
when he sees roberta he straightens up even more
roberta wants to talk to you o
concepcion touches his head then exits
did that sound o
yeah it did
ramon smiles pleased with himself
ive been thinking about justin
remember how mad i got the last time i saw him
you got very strict with him
it wasnt always so easy to be nice to him you know
ramon looks away from her upset
you think justins in heaven or hell
ramon runs his fingers along his bow
i told him to drop dead
roberta touches ramons back
justin didnt die because of what you said
how do you know
i dont think youre that powerful do you
i mean if you had such powers just imagine what kind of violin player youd be by now
id be better than you
they laugh together then ramon looks sad again
to cry you know
not for a man
my boys still cry and theyre big strong young men now
beat i bet justins daddy cried
ramons eyes get teary
roberta quietly leaves the room
roberta brings in the mail looking curiously at a manila envelope with a return address from the ny review of books
she opens it looks inside then pours out a batch of other letters onto the table
theyre addressed to box holder
she opens one reads it then rushes to an intercom
get down here right now
we were just trying to help
nick and lexi stand by the table opposite roberta with the incriminating pile of letters between them
this is humiliating
mom no one knows its you
i mean you dont even have to read them if you dont want to
glances at pile although obviously a lot of guys are interested in dating you
a lot of guys are interested in dating you and lexi
beat what did you say about me anyway
they thought shed never ask
beautiful musician late s tired of playing solo seeks a healthy stable attractive man whos not afraid of a duet with a strong independent woman
my violin playing will feed your soul
and my lasagna will be music to your palate
they beam with pride
roberta looks at them mortified
oh my god
did you catch all the music metaphors
dont you think its a little weird that youre trying to get your mother a date
dont you think its a little weird that youre not even interested in dating
number one even if i wanted to date i dont have time
and number two ive got my teaching ive got you guys thats all i need
the boys nod disappointed and she exits
they look at each other with glum expressions
to nick i really thought shed like the music metaphors
roberta lies on the couch reading the personal ad letters
she tosses one aside then opens another
the letter is designed like a newspaper with a headline that reads journalism professor dan paxton answers personal ad roberta cant help but be charmed
roberta nick and lexi play haydns trio together on their respective instruments
we sense that this is a special family ritual
they play throughout their conversation i think youre flat nick
im not flat
the b sounded flat
just play the violin mom
ill take care of the cello
they play for a few beats
you nervous mom
the doorbell rings and roberta jumps up bolting into the bathroom down the hall
lexi and nick exchange a smile then lexi crosses to the door and opens it
standing in the doorway is a man in casual college professor attire
hes nice looking but no prince charming
he shakes lexis hand and smiles warmly
im dan paxton
lexi shows him in
in the mirror roberta takes a last look at herself wondering if hell find her attractive
she touches her hair adjusts her dress then takes a deep breath as she builds up her courage
roberta enters the living room where dan is chatting with nick and lexi
dan sees her and is instantly smitten
shaking her hand wow
an honest woman
when you said you were beautiful you were telling the truth
she smiles blushing and avoids eye contact with her sons who are trying really hard not to laugh
as she and dan start to exit make sure youre home by midnight young lady
wider nick and lexi play a video game on the tv screen
theres the sound of a car
they race to the window
ten bucks he tries to kiss her
thats a no brainer
of course hell try
the real question is whether shell let him
ten bucks she lets him
they stare out the window intently
dan pulls his car up in front of robertas house
beside him roberta holds a program from a lincoln center concert
robertas tense but dan seems relaxed and centered in his attraction to her
i had a lot of fun tonight
yeah i did too
i have a confession ive never answered an ad before
i did it on a dare
well i have a confession my boys placed the ad behind my back
they both laugh then smile at each other
an awkward beat will he or wont he
dan leans in to kiss her and roberta turns away uncertain
look dan i went along with this cause its been a while
quite a while
and i had a very nice time
but im not sure if im ready to get involved with anyone right now
roberta feels badly about rejecting him
deadpan does this mean i dont get any lasagna
roberta cracks up
dan smiles at her
the boys are back to their video game covering that theyve been spying on her
why are you guys still up
all innocence why
is it late
good try nick
so how was it
as in lets just be friends nice
i dont know yet
nick looks disappointed
theres still a lot more letters
good night nick
she starts heading upstairs
hey mom can you loan me ten dollars
the blackboard reads spring concert in days
practice roberta rushes in frazzled not noticing at first that the beginners are very quiet and that most dont have violins
guys im so sorry i got stuck over at cpe
she puts her stuff down then looks at the kids
whats going on
where are all your violins
we heard you got fired
janet and dennis talk outside janets office
roberta storms over to them
janet looks at her alarmed
is it true
why dont you come in my office
youre firing me
its not me roberta
the board of ed
cut the budget the district had to comply and as of the end of this term the violin program has been
roberta takes this in momentarily speechless
in the b
the beginners slip into the hall to watch
beat they specifically said that my violin program has to go
theyve slashed the budget music and art programs got hit the worst
what about dennis classes
im tenured roberta
roberta looks at him then back to janet
when was this decided
things happened very quickly
i wanted to tell you myself reeling i just
i cant even believe this is happening
youre a sub
your position has never been permanent
shut up dennis
youre not helping
softly to roberta come into my office please
they leave dennis standing there looking as if hes had his face slapped
theres gotta be a way to fight this
fight it with what
i dont have any other extra programs to give them instead
oh i see
so after ten years after fourteen hundred children have learned to play the violin this is just an extra program
you know i dont feel that way and you know damn well ive been standing by you all these years
you think i havent noticed what youve done for these kids
then do something
points to her phone ive been on this phone for the past three days trying to do something the district office cant even stand the sound of my voice
believe me there are some people around here id much rather get rid of
but as far as the boards concerned violin classes are not a priority
robertas fury starts to give way to grief
she looks terribly wounded
janet looks at her helplessly
i dont have the power here roberta
im so sorry
a beat and roberta exits
robertas dazed and in pain as she walks through the crowds of children oblivious to kids calling her name and waving
nick and lexi enter the darkened house chatting as nick wheels in the bike and lexi bounces a basketball
they turn on a light to reveal sitting at the kitchen table with a glass of wine her face ashen
roberta nick and lexi walk allegra in their neighborhood
roberta looks worn out
im a good teacher
ive worked so hard to give these kids something to be proud of
lexi moves to comfort her
im so sorry mom
i cant believe they did this to you
its like when my father got killed
for twenty years he followed every safety rule the factory had and then someone else flips the wrong switch
she chokes up its not fair
you do everything right and then
its the wrong analogy
you couldnt do anything about grandpas death
it was irreversible
tell that to the board of education
let me ask you something
why did you risk your life for a bicycle
roberta and lexi look at nick baffled as to the relevance of the question
i did not risk my life
of course you did
and for what two hundred dollars
not for that
when someone steals something that belongs to my kids im not gonna sit back and let that happen
a beat as she realizes what shes just said
the boys look at her and the three of them stop walking
guys you need to think about this
if i try to fight this with no salary coming in i could lose the house screw up your college plans
it would be a lot safer to just go out tomorrow and get a job in a private school
yeah but is that where you really want to be
roberta frantically searches through her purse then crosses to a hall closet and quickly checks the pockets of her coats and jackets
she feels inside a jacket pocket then finds it dorotheas follow dan paxton as he walks down the hall towards his office and sees a strange silver object on the
floor in front of his office door
he picks it up
a foil covered plate with a note on top do you know anyone dan lifts up the foil to reveal a large piece of lasagna
seventy five kids play we shall overcome and its incredibly moving
nicks on cello lexi plays piano
roberta proudly leads the children
at the side of the stage we see dorothea photographing the concert
the camera pans the audience of teary eyed parents many of them with cam corders
we find ramons family
manuelo is riverted by his sons playing and he starts to cry
concepcion knows this without looking
she takes his hand
angle janet stands along the side and her eyes start to fill with tears
she tries to stay composed then discreetly exits the auditorium
the song ends and the audience applauds rising from their seats including assunta now next to isabel and dan
someone remains seated a reporter s sitting beside dan and taking notes
the students bow then point to roberta who bows and takes the stage
she gestures for people to sit
a beginner student brings her flowers
roberta kisses her then approaches the mike
to the audience the beautiful concert that you just heard could be the last concert of the east harlem violin program
the board of education and the district superintendent dont think that music is important for our children
but theyre wrong and theyre in for a fight
the parents stand and applaud
we see the reporter writing quickly
dorothea snaps more pictures
roberta extends an arm towards the kids directing the applause at them
ramon gives her a thumbs up
roberta is vacuuming the living room while assunta dusts
extra chairs are set up in the living room in preparation for a meeting
the doorbell rings
follow assunta to the door
she opens it revealing janet whos carrying two bags of groceries
assuntas demeanor instantly cools when she sees her
in the b
roberta sees janet and turns off the vacuum cleaner
how are you
id be a lot better if my daughter had a job next year
to assunta i would too
janet briskly walks into the living room puts the grocery bags down on a table and begins to take things out of them
roberta watches her mystified
to roberta sorry im early but i figured wed need time to set up
roberta watches janet for a beat then addresses assunta
mama why dont you take allegra out for a walk
assunta hesitates for a beat then gets the dog and exits
janet continues unpacking the bags as if theres nothing unusual about her being there
cheeses crackers bread salads fruit paper plates napkins etc
she sees robertas confused expression
you are having a meeting here tonight right
parents and teachers
well yes but
take it from me
if you want to get parents to help you with something you have to feed them
she holds up two wedges of cheese
you have a cutting board for these
roberta crosses into the kitchen and returns with a cutting board and a knife
as she continues to unpack and if you think parents are bad teachers are even worse no offense
if you dont feed them you never get anything extra out of them
thats why i got this
she pulls out an entenmanns blackout cake
entenmanns gets them every time
roberta continues to stare in amazement at janet
dont tell me you expected me to bring something homemade
as she takes the cake from her well no
because take it from me my own family begs me to stay out of the kitchen
what i didnt expect was for you to be here
weve gotta figure out a way to fight this
as she arranges crackers on a plate after ten years roberta i cant imagine walking through those hallways and not hearing that off key screechy scratchy nails on the blackboard
janet holds up a baguette
what do you think
cut it into slices now or leave it whole
lets cut it now
itll be less messy
janet hands her the bread
a beat as the two women exchange a private smile then return to their respective tasks
theres a crowd of parents assembled in robertas front room talking at once yelling out ideas including concepcion beverly wilson shandras mom mr
adams black and mrs
adams puerto rican the parents of james from robertas first year and simon
dorothea janet isabel are also there assunta is keeping tabs on the refreshments
dont they realize how much this program helps the kids
simons our third child to study with roberta
james is pre med aprils valedictorian now that says something
i think we should inundate the board and the district with letters
youre wasting your time
the board and the district are not gonna pay for this program no matter how many letters they get
what if we raise the money ourselves
i cant see how theyd object to that
a beat as people take this in
well once that newspaper article comes out that should help bring in money
yeah but what if it doesnt
for all we know its gonna be buried on the back page
besides who says anyones gonna give a damn about our kids
to roberta what if you do a benefit concert
we can raise a batch of money from ticket sales and then the concert itself could be great publicity
theres word of mouth
you could get reviewed
it better be a good concert
some people laugh but we see the anxiety on robertas face
we have to offer something more than me and the kids
to dorothea do you think maybe your husband would perform with us
slyly im sure i could persuade him with a little pillow talk
and maybe he can get another violinist too itzhak perlman perhaps
this gets peoples attention
that would be fantastic
we could rent a place like the nd street y its perfect for this
it seats about nine hundred people and if we charge between fifty and a hundred a ticket to roberta we could probably raise enough to reinstate your program for a
sounds like a plan
half to herself it better be a good concert
the doorbell rings and roberta crosses to get it
dan enters holding copies of the ny post the daily news and a couple of other papers
each paper has been opened to a specific page
take your pick
roberta grabs the top one the post opened to page
the page has a photo of roberta at the spring concert and a large article headlined a violin teacher fights back
lots of chaos as a television news crew sets up
roberta tries futilely to get the beginners to pay attention to her
kids listen to me its really important that you dont look at the camera and you try to act as natural as possible
dennis storms in
who authorized this
well janets not here today and i want these people out of here
the kids quiet down and watch them argue
a camera guy starts shooting the argument and dennis sees him
turn that off you hear me
why are you doing this
were not bothering anyone
youre disrupting school and i want them out of here now
you still dont get it do you
i dont care if you hate me dennis thats your business
but think about the students for once
every time you interfere youre not hurting me youre hurting them
she points to the kids
theyre silent waiting to see if roberta got through to him
get these people out of here or im calling the police
go right ahead call them
thatll look real good on the eleven oclock news
a beat and he exits
roberta takes a deep breath then turns back to the kids who are watching her impressed
i dont hear no sirens
on the tv is the news segment roberta speaks to an unseen interviewer
im from a blue collar family and if it werent for the lessons i got in public school i never would have learned the violin
it cuts to robertas beginners speaking to the interviewer
how does it make you feel to lose your violin program
it makes us sad
yeah like were never gonna have no more violin lessons and its bad because
because we love violin class
wider reveal roberta lexi and nick watching the tv
yes ive gotten offers from two private schools but this is where i want to be
arnold these kids need help
wider reveal a comfortable upper east side apartment and dorothea watching t
while arnold practices violin
theres framed photography on the walls signed by dorothea
didnt we send them a donation
they need something bigger
and you cant just write a check you have to get involved
the look on her face tells him its more than he bargained for
arnold steinhardt speaks on the phone
his roladex is open to the name itzhak perlman
in the b
dorothea tensely waits to hear if itzhak perlman will say yes
parents roberta nick and lexi hang fiddlefest concert posters around their neighborhood announcing a concert at the nd street y with arnold steinhardt itzhak perlman and
parents including beverly wilson concepcion mr
adams and carlos mom and dad stuff envelopes with invitations to fiddlefest and accompanying letters and ticket order forms
roberta and dorothea open envelopes with filled out ticket order forms and checks
they stack the checks in a pile address return envelopes and place fiddlefest tickets inside them
thirty three excited kids from robertas different classes chat tune their violins rosin their bows
the students include carlos stephanie amanda kenny rachel simon ramon vanessa and shandra
roberta enters the room full of energy and addresses them as she heads to the front
listen up everyone
the students give her their attention
you are my very best beginner and advanced violin students and ive chosen you to play in fiddlefest because i trust that you can handle the pressure
its gonna be a lot of work a lot
right now weve sold some tickets but im not gonna be back here in the fall if the audience storms out of their seats demanding a refund
she nods to rachel who starts handing out sheets of music
rachels gonna be my lieutenant and i expect you to listen to her
ramon looks through his music sheets
bachs minuet one
people are gonna be paying good money for this concert were not just gonna play twinkle
handing out papers im passing out a contract that you and your parents need to sign
the kids read the contracts
carlos eyes widen
every saturday and sunday
plus night time rehearsals during the week
theres only six weeks till the concert so classes in school wont be enough
the kids look sobered by this
come to think of it well probably also need to meet before school
lots of grumbling say what
ima be sleepwalking
youve heard of navy seal training
well this is gonna be roberta string training
another angle two young men and two young women walk in carrying violins
we realize from the scar that one is naeem now a strikingly handsome man over six feet tall
with him is de sean a short guy with dreadlocks looking more like a rapper than a violinist
guadalupe walking with a cane is now a beautiful young woman her long braid pinned up
the fourth is a reserved puerto rican woman
oh my god
hugs them guadalupe
she hugs her then looks closely at the other woman
is that you
the woman snaps her fingers and smiles
roberta laughs and embraces her then turns to the students
kids these are four of my very first violin students and ive asked them to play in the concert with us
to the alumni i was just telling them how hard theyre gonna have to work
to class take it from me this lady dont lie
yall are gonna work your butts off
ramons father carefully reads the violin contract while ramon and concepcion anxiously watch
he stops to look up a word in the english spanish dictionary beside him
ramon and his mom are squirming
manuelo nods as he finishes reading then signs the contract
ramon breaks into a smile throws his little arms around his papa and kisses him
schools letting out carlos sister exits carrying carlos violin
a few beats later carlos quickly exits checking his watch
he sees his los leones teammates standing in a group and tries to bypass them without being noticed but they spot him
where ya goin
we got a game remember
yeah i know but
i cant make it
what you talkin about
i just cant make it
you got a date with the violin teacher
he dashes off a barrage of spanish and english curses behind him and crosses to his sister waiting for him down the street
he takes the violin from her and carries it himself
the fiddlefest kids including carlos vanessa shandra ramon stephanie amanda kenny simon thomas de sean and guadalupe practice bachs minuet one roberta leading them and giving direction
theyre playing badly
rachel plays as well but walks around the room making corrections
its early morning and the kids look half asleep
i need more accents on the down beat
they play a few more bars and still sound pretty bad
they do so you sound horrible
isnt anyone practicing
how can we practice
were rehearsing all the time
some kids laugh including stephanie
to stephanie you think this is funny stephanie
to all of them you think the four hundred people whove bought tickets so far will think its funny too
you think itzhak perlman will think its funny that hes donating his time and youre all gonna stink
vanessa yawns and roberta sees her
am i boring you vanessa
its in the morning
im just tired
theres no time to be tired
to all getting her violin in position lets try it again
dorothea opens the door for roberta who just charges in agitated without even saying hello
we sense that dorothea too is troubled by something
i must have been crazy to agree to this
theyre never gonna be ready
and you should hear the bach double
so the good news is tickets are selling like hot cakes but the bad news is that the kids sound like shit
theres more bad news
weve lost the y
roberta looks at her aghast
they had a flood a water heater burst
the concert hall was damaged and theyve cancelled all events
until further notice
this cant happen
weve sold tickets
weve done publicity
the concerts in three weeks
ive been on the phone all morning calling other theaters
they both sink into the couch completely undone by this
just keep looking
the fiddlefest kids are crammed into robertas house including de sean guadalupe ramon vanessa shandra carlos thomas stephanie amanda kenny and simon rehearsing orange blossom special
they play badly
rachel helps roberta correct students
someones playing the wrong notes
and you shouldnt need your music anymore
except for the bach double everything has to be memorized by next rehearsal
the kids look at each other daunted
and you sound like youre sleepwalking
your hearts not even in it
maybe cause we dont have a place for the concert
roberta looks at her and then notices the despondent looks on many of the kids faces
well youre right
this might all be for nothing
so we can either keep on rehearsing in case we find a place or we can just
am i hearing right
did you use the words give up
to the students lets take a vote
how many of you want to give up
no one raises a hand
roberta takes this in
you taught us well
its early morning
lexi cooks breakfast while nick and roberta look at scribbled on marked up lists
what about in the bronx
beat why dont you just do it in one of the schools
itll be a lot smaller but we wont make enough money
what about postponing it
itzhak and arnold are booked all summer
they all look depressed
lexi places an equally depressing looking stack of pancakes on the table
theres a banging on the door startling everyone
nick opens the door and dorothea rushes in out of breath talking a mile a minute
i have good news really good news
arnold got a call from his friend wally scheur who heard about us losing the y and wanted to see how he could help and then wally had this brilliant
idea and called his friend isaac stern and its all arranged
we have a new place for fiddlefest
dorothea grins from ear to ear nick and lexi whoop and holler and all wait for roberta to jump up and down for joy but she looks stricken
panicked carnegie hall
close on the ceiling of carnegie hall revolving slowly
she stands on the empty stage gazing at the ceiling as she slowly turns around
shes holding her violin case
she looks at the upper balconies the lower balconies the orchestra seats
her footsteps echo as she walks towards the front of the stage then stops
we can see her imagining the audience on the night of the concert
she cant believe her eyes
a beat and she looks around to make sure shes alone
she takes out her violin takes a deep breath as she looks out towards her audience then starts to play the second violin part of the bach double concerto
suddenly theres the sound of a stage door opening
incredible sound in this room no
roberta turns to see isaac stern approaching her
shes completely flustered
oh my god isaac stern
you must be roberta
thank you so much for helping us
looking out at the hall would you believe in they tried to tear this place down
they wanted to replace it with a bright red skyscraper we called it the red terror
we had to fight like hell but with a lot of help we saved carnegie hall
roberta takes this in relating it to her own struggle
if its all right with you id like to play in your concert
maybe bring a couple of friends
yes of course
that would be great
isaac nods then touches her shoulder
dont give up
roberta pours nervous energy into her cappuccino adding cinnamon chocolate and sugar stirring loudly
dan sits across from her observing
i just dont see how im gonna do this
its carnegie hall
and listen to this now isaac stern wants to play with us diane monroe michael tree theres other people calling thats fantastic
ill never get the kids up to speed in time ill never get myself up to speed
im gonna be playing side by side with the worlds greatest violinists
and the worlds greatest violinists are playing side by side with you because they want to help you win this fight
he offers her a forkful of some decadent looking chocolate cake but she shakes her head
you dont understand
maybe theres a good reason why i never made it as a violinist maybe i just cant cut it
i keep blaming it on not having enough early training but if i were talented if i had a gift but you do have a gift
youre gonna put thirty east harlem kids on stage at carnegie hall not because theyre prodigies but because you got them to stick with something thats hard as hell and
to strive for excellence which by the way i certainly wasnt striving for when i was their age
not to mention the other ten years worth of students whose lives were changed because of you
thats your talent roberta
she takes this in looks at him gratefully and puts her hand over his
he strokes her hand
beat and by the way i happen to think youre a pretty good violinist too
youve barely heard me play
ive heard enough to know youre gonna do just fine
roberta looks at him with trepidation
dan takes another forkful of his cake

janet stands onstage and addresses the audience
when i became the principal of central park east elementary i envisioned a school where children could fulfill their highest potential despite the challenges of poverty and racism
ten years ago roberta guaspari walked into my office because she needed a job and because she had a vision that any child could learn the violin
we put our dreams together and created the east harlem violin program which has helped more than a thousand students expand their vision of whats possible in their lives
when a program like this is cut our childrens future is compromised
i want to thank you for your support
enjoy the concert
in the b
we hear the audience applauding janet
roberta holds up her hands to quiet down the anxious students
everyone attention please
they become quiet

back again to the stage where the students and guest violinists bow
and move in closer on roberta in her moment of triumph
roberta addresses the audience
her voice is strong but softer around the edges she is a woman in a state of grace
were all here tonight because we have a bigger mission to take the magical spirit of tonights concert with us out into the world and to fight for music and
art to be a part of every childs education
the applause is deafening then slowly diminishes as we roberta addresses ten first graders sitting in a circle on the floor
she points to the horsehair on her bow
the frog hair
roberta and the kids laugh
did you ever see a frog with hair
the boy smiles and shakes his head
to the boy but youre right there is a frog
can you show me where it is
one girl raises her hand with urgency
sssh let him answer
the boy points to the frog of the bow and roberta smiles
and as she continues her lesson her voice recedes and we roberta guaspari lives in east harlem with her daughter sofia whom she adopted from el salvador
nick is a professional cellist in a graduate music program and alexi has been accepted to medical school
roberta teaches violin to approximately students a year in three east harlem elementary schools
the east harlem violin program however is still not funded by the new york city board of education
the money raised from fiddlefest supported robertas violin program for three years
roberta and opus continue their fundraising efforts to keep the program alive
