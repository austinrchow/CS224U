href b b interview with the vampire interview with the vampire screenplay by anne rice produced by stephen woolley david geffen directed by neil jordan cast list tom cruise lestat
de lioncourt brad pitt louis pointe du lac antonio banderas armand stephen rea santiago christian slater daniel malloy kirsten dunst claudia a small bare room illuminated only by the streetlight coming through the window
a hand presses a cassette into a recorder and fiddles with a small microphone
malloy sits over a table fiddling with the tape
he is young half shaven dressed in t shirt and jeans
he looks too louis who stands by the window looking out on the street with his back to malloy
louis is dressed in an old fashioned suit
so you want me to tell you the story of my life
thats what i do
i interview people
i collect lives
i just interviewed a genuine hero a cop who quietly interrupting youd have to have a lot of tape for my story
ive had a very unusual life
so much the better
ive got a pocket full of tapes
you followed me here didnt you
saw you in the street outside
you seemed interesting
is this where you live
its just a room
so shall we begin
playfully almost teasing what do you do
im a vampire
i knew you were interesting
you mean this literally i take it
i was watching you watching me
i was waiting for you in that alleyway
and then you began to speak
well what a lucky break for me
perhaps lucky for both of us
still in shadow he turns from the window and approaches the table
ill tell you my story
all of it
id like to do that very much
malloy is uneasy as he studies the shadowy figure fascinated but afraid
you were going to kill me
drink my blood
yes but you neednt worry about that now
louis stands opposite hand on the chair
malloy is riveted
you believe this dont you
that youre a vampire
you really think
we cant begin this way
let me turn on the light
but i thought vampires didnt like the light
we love it
i only wanted to prepare you
louis pulls the chord of the overhead naked light bulb
appears inhumanly white eyes glittering
inhuman or not alive
the effect is subtle beautiful and ghastly
he struggles to suppress fear and understand
dont be frightened
i want this opportunity
the light appears to go out by itself and suddenly louis is in the chair dimly lit by the street light from the window
the cassette is turning
how did you do that
the same way you do it
a series of simple gestures
only i moved too fast for you to see
im flesh and blood you see
but not human
i havent been human for two hundred years
malloy is speechless frightened yet enthralled
what can i do to put you at ease
shall we begin like david copperfield
i am born i grow up
or shall we begin when i was born to darkness as i call it
thats really where we should start dont you think
youre not lying to me are you
why should i lie
was the year it happened
i was twenty four younger than you are now
but times were different then
i was a man at that age
the master of a large plantation just south of new orleans
a disheveled louis hair in pigtail in deep pocket frock coat rides his horse through the fields of indigo passing an overseer and slaves at work
he passes slave quarters and the distant colonial mansion of pointe du lac
he comes to a small parish church and a graveyard
he dismounts and walks through the tombs to an elaborate one in greek style
i had just lost my wife in childbirth
she and the infant had been buried less than half a year
there is a marble angel above the tomb feminine with a tiny cherub angel in her arms
louis looks from the angel down to the inscriptions on the tomb louis rips away the vines already covering the inscription then drinks from a pocket flask
his face is ashen
i was twenty four and life seemed finished
i couldnt bear the pain of their loss
i longed for a release from it
louis in ragged lace and dirty brocade sitting between two whores at a gaming table drinking absinthe
all around him flatboatmen whores gamblers black african freedmen
i wanted to lose everything
my wealth my estate my sanity
but lady luck didnt oblige
louis displays a hand of four aces
a gambler at the table stands in fury over turning money cards drinks
youre calling me a cheat
im calling you a piece of shit the gambler pulls out a pearl handled pistol and points it at louis
the crowd hushes and draws back
louis smiles drunkenly and stands
he rips open his lace shirt exposing his chest
then do me a favor
get rid of this piece of shit
the gamblers finger on the trigger
his hand shakes
you lack the courage of your convictions sir
lestat a hooded figure in the corner smiles from beneath the shadow of his hood
gleaming blue eyes
most of all i longed for death
i know that now
i invited it a release from the pain of living
the gambler lowers his gun scowling
louis pockets the fistfulls of coins he has won
loud crowded riverfront taverns full of ruffians
louis staggers down an arm around a whore drinking from a bottle
a pockmarked pimp follows behind
my invitation was open to anyone
sailors thieves whores and slaves
louis quite insensible being propped up against a wall by the whore in a dank wharf over the water
the pimp rifles his pockets then pulls a knife about to slice his throat when a shadow falls over him
he turns and we see the face of lestat who lifts him into the air by his throat breaking his neck
the whore screams and lestats other hand clamps over her mouth
lestat drags her towards him
louis falls to the ground supported no more insensible
close on his face as we hear the last breaths of life of the whore off
but it was a vampire that accepted
the bodies of the thief and whore float by
above on the wharf louis now awake stares down at them
he turns to see lestat towering above him
they would have killed you then my luck would have changed
you want death
is it death you want
lestat floats down on top of him then lifts him in the air draws his head back by the hair and sinks his teeth in his neck
every muscle rigid teeth clenched as the blood is drained from him
hovering above the ground like two quivering dancers
the wind billows through the ghostly white sails and rigging of the boats around the wharf
floats higher with louis in his arms draining his blood
one hand reaches out and grips a rope hanging from a shipmast
the other holds louis
he withdraws his teeth and looks into louis drained face
you still want death
or have you tasted it enough
louis can barely get the words out
lestat smiles and lets him go
louis falls and plummets into the water below
coming to the surface in the water lapping by the wharf
the bodies of the whore and thief float beside him
he looks up and sees lestat way above him dangling from the rope of the shipmast
captivated terrified enthralled
thats how it happened
the gift of darkness requires more than that as youll see
louis floating by mudflats surrounded by dead fish the carcasses of animals eighteenth century rubbish
he gets to his feet and walks weakly through the mudflats
the sun is coming up over the sea behind him
he left me half dead that morning
he wanted something from me
he came back the following night
louis is delirious in a four poster bed shrouded with mosquito netting
a female slave yvette bathes his face with a rag
she is crying
other slave women hover in the shadows
yvette puts out all candles save one by the bed and withdraws with the others
candlelight flickers on the face of the bisque virgin
louis tosses and turns dreaming murmuring incoherently
then he opens his eyes
lestat exquisitely dressed in french clothing stands by the bed smiling
in the light of the candle we see that he is not human skin too white eyes too bright
lestat looks amiable even mischievous but impossible and angel or monster
louis grabs his pistol from the table and cocks it
who the hell are you
what are you doing in my house
and a beautiful house it is too
yours is a good life isnt it
louis takes aim
lestat puts his hand over the barrel
the bullet tears a hole in lestats hand
lestat is unfazed
he takes the gun from louis hand and throws it away
his hand begins to heal
youre not afraid of anything are you
why should i be
louis reaches for his sword hanging by the bed and point it
lestat laughs indulgently
he draws closer
are you going to put that through me too
ruin my beautiful clothes
he comes closer to louis right up to his face so the sword passes through his waistcoat
were all last nights promises for nothing
he reaches out with his now healed hand and plucks out the sword
what do you want from me
ive come to answer your prayers
you want to die dont you
life has no meaning anymore does it
lestat sits down on the bed drawing up one knee
louis is becoming spellbound
the wine has no taste
the food sickens you
there seems no reason for any of it does there
but what if i could give it back to you
pluck out the pain and give you another life
and it would be for all time
and sickness and death could never touch you again
the vampire theme rises with the sound of a heartbeat
the camera drifts through the graveyard where louis wife is buring
everything is lit with an eerie glow as if seen through some unearthly eye
vampires thats what we are
creatures of darkness only we see it that darkness more clearly than any mortal has ever seen
louis and lestat drifting dreamlike through the overhanging vines comes to the grave of his wife and child
above the crypt the statue of angel mother and child
wouldnt it be sweet to bid pain goodbye
to wave away anguish and grief
to embrace the peace of the unending night
the marble fingers of the child on the statue move
the angel raises her head and has the face of louis wife diane
she raises her hand and touches louis tear streamed face
the child speaks
louis reaches out to embrace them and finds himself touching cold marble
he cries out in anguish diane
they are gone louis
death took them
death which you can now destroy
louis thrashing on the bed in a delirium
lestat places a hand on his forehead and soothes him
you have to ask me for this
you have to want it do you hear me
give it to me
we thrive on blood
i want it
lestat bends close as if to drink louis blood
louis does not shrink back but stares into his eyes
lestat draws back then stands up and goes to the french doors
you must prove yourself
i will give you the choice i never had
he looks outside
the suns coming up
watch it carefully
if you come with me tomorrow youll never see it again
louis sits dazed staring at the empty french window
the sun rises with unnatural beauty over the swamplands and the plantation filling the room striking water pitcher glass mirror and the picture of his dead wife
my last sunrise
that morning i was not yet a vampire and i saw my last sunrise
i remember it completely yet i dont remember any sunrise before it
i watched the whole magnificence of the dawn for the last time as if it were the first
and the i said goodbye to sunlight and went out to become what i became
lestat and louis walk through the slave quarters huddles groups around fires music singing
the sound of whipping is heard
your grief has unhinged you
youve let your estate rot
in the woods beyond the quarters the white overseer is whipping a black slave with horrifying savagery
you let your overseer run riot work your slaves to the bone
well start with him
how do you mean start
the overseer turns and comes towards them with the bloodied whip
why the bloody whip carlos
the overseer looks into his eyes shivers with terror drops the whip and runs for the trees
lestat is on him in an instant
he sinks is teeth in his neck
louis runs to him tries to pull him off
but lestat turns to louis and smiles with his bloodied mouth
lets call that a start
i cant do it
youve just done it kill me if you will but i cant do this
he flees as lestat ends to finish off the overseer
louis running up the steps leading to the gallery
he is crazed with guilt
he looks up and sees sitting collected at the head of the steps
backs away as lestat rises and descends the steps so fluidly he hardly seems to move
he was white trash they come at two a penny
i dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave licked his wounds clean
youre the devil arent you
thats who you are
gently i wish i were
but if i were what would i want with you
i cant go through with it i tell you
your bitter and youre strong
but why do you want me
because youre as strong as i was when i was alive
louis takes out his flask and drinks
drunkenly he turns and heads for a nearby swamp
louis stops again in front of the crypt
drinks from the flask leans his forehead against the stone
lestat appears beside him radiant beautiful
you really want to be with them
kill me like you promised you asked for death
i didnt promise it in a quiet rage lestat raise his fist and shatters the marble face stone revealing a coffin below
his fist shatters that in turn revealing the half rotted body of a women holding an infant no longer recognizable as individuals a tangle of gruesome rotted hair flesh eaten
away lace insects and worms crawling over it
its not your wife and child my friend
just that simple
think and choose
it happens to everyone
lestat stares at him smiling becoming a hazy dreamlike vision then hyperclear
louis again is spellbound
he drops the flask which shatters on the stones
lestat appears angelic in his radiance
we shall be this way always my friend
young as we are now
im lonely for a companion lonely for your strength
but im not that lonely
do you want to come or not
louis capitulates in one long sigh
lestat comes closer smiling
did i hear a yes
lestat embraces louis obscuring his face
he drinks his blood
we hear two heartbeats out of sync coming together
we see louis face growing paler paler as his blood is drained
his eyes stare upwards losing their focus
the moon through hanging vines
the marble statue of his wife and child smile at him as if come alive
her hair blows in the breeze wonderful gold tresses the childs fingers reach out
lestat lets louis fall down beside the broken crypt
louis looks from the rotting bodies to lestat above him
lestat speaks gently
ive drained you to the point of death
if you drink from me you live for ever
if i leave you here you die
lestat lifts his hand to his lips and blows louis a kiss
dont leave me here
give it to me
lestat lifts his own right wrist to his teeth
fangs slash his own flesh blood falls
louis rises to accept the first drops with his open mouth
lestat gathers him up as louis clamps his hand on lestats arm and drinks from the wrist
the vampire theme swells
lestat watches him drink his wrist with wry amusement
louis finishes staggers away from him as if drunk
the world is transformed the swamp the moon the clouds the cry of the night birds all come to him with unnatural clarity
he looks down with pity at the corpses of his wife and child who appear beautiful in death now rather than repulsive
he closes the lid of the coffin and replaces it in the ground astonished at the ease of it
he turns and stares at lestat whom he sees now with vampires vision
lestats eyes are brighter his buttons are glimmering in the light
everything is clearer brighter containing more facets of light and color
stop staring at my buttons
didnt i tell you it was going to be fun
lestat leads him into the swamp
everything astonished louis as if hes never seen it before
louis is suddenly racked by shudders of pain
youre bodys dying
pay no attention
it will take twenty minutes at most
louis dry retches
it happens to us all
lestat wipes louis brow
come youre going to feed now
i want a woman
lestat laughs and his laughter echoes like bells in louis ears
that doesnt matter anymore louis
small high ground
camp of runaway slaves
several share a bottle of rum around the fire
a male slave rises
a gorgeous hunk of flesh in the moonlight and goes into the swamp to relieve his bladder
theyre all beautiful now
men women the old the young
simply because they are alive
the slave walks towards them in the darkness
a crucifix gleams round his neck
the crucifix forget the crucifix
resist no more louis
the slave looks up and sees them
two gleaming white beings standing before him with devils eyes
the he runs
louis can resist him no more
he swoops on him with a vampires rapid movement brings him to the ground and sinks his teeth in his neck
close on louis feeding on the slave the magnificent body shuddering in its death throes
lestat stands above laughing
the slave dies
louis rises from him drunkenly engorged with blood
what have i done
you have fed
you were made for this
louis looks down at the body of the slave
lestats laughter echoes around him
dear god what have i done
youve killed louis
and enjoyed it
lestat laughs harder
louis runs from him screaming in anguish
louis reaches his wifes grave
he falls to his knees throws back his head and bares his new fangs to the moon
dear god what have i become
malloy stares at louis terrified and enthralled
you said the slave had a crucifix
oh that rumor about crosses
you cant look at them
nonsense my friend
i can look on anything i like
and i am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes
the story about stakes through the heart
as you would say today
what about coffins
coffins unfortunately are a necessity
louis walks up the steps to the mansion
he looks now like a fully fledged vampire
yvette the slave girl stares at him from the open doorway
cascades of harpsichord music come from the interior
killing is no ordinary act
it is the experience of anothers life for certain
that night i had lost my own life and taken anothers
i was drowning in a sea of human guilt and regret with all the heightened senses of a vampire
louis enters the mansion following the harpsichord music as if in a dream
yvette draws back as he approaches
louis wanders into the parlor where lestat is playing the harpsichord rapidly and exuberantly
louis goes to a full length mirror and sees his own reflection there quite the perfect vampire
yes thats you my handsome friend
and youll look that way till the stars fall from heaven
it cant be
give it time
youre like a man who loses a limb and still imagines he feels pain
it will pass
and we must sleep now
i can feel the sun approaching
dawn spreading over the plantation
a brick walled storage room
two coffins stand on the floor
lestat enters with a lantern louis behind
lestat is apprehensive and protective of louis
he pulls back one lid ot reveal a satin interior
you must get into it
its the only safe place for you when the light comes
and if i dont
the sun will destroy the blood ive given you
every tissue every vein
the fire in this lantern could do that too
louis approaches the coffin hands trembling as he peers into it
dont be afraid
in moments youll be sleeping as soundly as you ever slept
and when you awake ill be waiting for you and so will all the world
louis crawls into the coffin fearful yet fascinated
you told me something earlier
you said you didnt have a choice
was that true
lestat smiles bitterly and nods
someday ill tell you
we have a lot of time to talk to each other
you might say
we have all the time we shall ever need
he closes the lid
sounds of louis panicked breathing
of his prayer again
dear god what have i done
louis and lestat sitting at a sumptuous table piled with uneaten food
lestat is going through sheafs of documents
i awoke the next evening to a different world
and i realized there are as profound differences between vampires as between human beings
lestat totting up figures on a piece of paper
your wealth dear louis is inestimable
your income from cotton alone will keep us in comfort for a century
louis just stares at him
i sat there staring at him with contempt
he had the soul of a shopkeeper he was the sows ear out of which nothing fine could be made
i felt sadly cheated in having him as a teacher
lestat looks up at him and grins
youll get used to killing
just forget about that mortal coil
youll become accustomed to things all too quickly
do you think so
yvette enters stands behind him staring at lestat with loathing
you are not hungry sir
au contraire my dear
he could eat a horse
lestat laughs loudly
louis turns and looks at yvette
her beautiful forehead in the candlelight the veins pulsing on her neck and her hands
i looked at anything mortal and saw all life as precious condemning all fruitless guilt and passion that would let it slip through the fingers like sand
yvette returns his stare troubled
it was only as a vampire that i could see yvettes beauty
her fear of me increased my desire
yvette reaches for his uneaten plate
louis stops her hand
holds it for a beat too long looking at the veins in her wrist
i will finish it yvette
now leave us
she turns and runs from the table
lestat leans towards him
cant you pretend you fool
dont give the game away
were lucky to have such a home
his hand snakes out under the table
it comes up holding a large grey rat
pretend to drink at least
he bares his fangs and slices the rats throat
he pours the blood into a crystal glass
such fine crystal shouldnt go to waste
he hands the glass to louis
louis drinks the blood and stares at it in surprise then at the dead rat on the fine lace tablecloth
it gets cold so fast
we can live like this
off the blood of animals
i wouldnt call it living
id call it surviving
a useful trick if youre caught for a month on a ship at sea
lestat strokes the belly of the dead rat studying it sadly
theres nothing in the world now that doesnt hold some
and im bored with this prattle he throws the rat away
but we can live without taking human life
anything is possible
but just try it for a week
come into new orleans and let me show you some real sport
a big lavish drinking place with a raised stage
italian actors in buffoonish costumes act crude commedia dellarte on the stage
plantation owners in soiled brocade lace crooked wigs watch the show as tavern wenches move about
this was new orleans a magical and magnificent place to live
in which a vampire richly dressed might attract no more notice in the evening than hundreds of other exotic creatures
louis and lestat by a table in the shadow of a tree
teresa a tavern wench sits on lestats lap pouring drinks for the two of them
she lifts a fresh glass to lestats lips as he flirts with her
come on mon cher
the best in the colony
once you touch this youll never go to any other tavern again
you think so cherie
but what if id rather taste your lips
my lips are even sweeter still
she kisses him
he lets his tongue play with hers then runs it down her neck
she swoons with pleasure
then he sinks his teeth gently in her neck looking playfully behind at louis who if appalled and fascinated
laughter rocks the tavern
lestat slips the pale and dead teresa into a chair beside him and folds her hands on the table
no one notices
he lays gold coins on the table and touches louis knee
lets get out of here
lestat rushes out thrilled with himself
a crowded street
louis and lestat emerge from the tavern
louis looks up at the moon
have you ever been caught
of course not
its so easy you almost feel sorry for them
they walk down the crowded night street full of ladies in their finery freed slaves whores sailors etc
lestat killed two sometimes three a night
a fresh young girl that was his favorite for the first of the evening
small orchestra plays for colonial couples in fine wig and garb prancing to a french minuet
young women sit in chairs along the walls with their chaperones
young men stand opposite
but the triumphant kill of lestat was a young man
they represented the greatest loss to lestat because they stood on the threshold of the maximum possibility of life
a youth of preternatural beauty silhouetted against french windows
he is talking to an elegant widow seated holding two manicured poodles
lestat stares at the youth with longing
the trick is not to think about it
see that one
the widow st
she had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband
shes perfect for you
but how do you know
read her thoughts
the dark gift is different for each of us
but one thing is true of everyone
we grow stronger as we go along
he leads louis closer to them
take my word for it
she blamed a slave for his murder
and do you know what they did to him
he smiles at the young man who smiles in return
the evildoers are easier
and they taste better
lestat walks the youth towards a copse of trees
he looks back at louis who holds both poodles on a delicate leash walking with the widow
the minuet spills from the french windows
now young man you really amaze me
im old enough to be your grandmother
she leans towards him concquettishly
louis crazed with hunger sees her as beautiful in the moonlight
he allows her lips reach his
he takes her in his arms gently romantically and sinks in his teeth
yes thats the melody i remember it
louis draws his lips away
she is weak in his arms but still alive
he cant do it
the poodles growl
he shoots out an arm and grabs one then the other
lestat bending over the body of the dead youth
a scream pierces the night
the widow on the grass her poodles dead beside her
louis is trying to quiet her
my little papillions
he killed them
lestat comes from nowhere claps a hand over her mouth and breaks her neck
he spits in fury at louis
you whining coward of a vampire who prowls the night killing rats and poodles
you could have finished us both
louis throws himself on lestat with extraordinary force pummeling him towards the trees
what have you done to me
youve condemned me to hell
i dont know any hell louis hurls him against tree after tree with a strength he never knew he had
you want to see me kill
watch me kill you then he drags him to the ground an throttles him
lestat looks up at him amazed and amused at the same time
what strength my friend what strength
i remember why i chose you now
lestat squirms from his grip seemingly effortlessly
but you cant kill me louis
nor i you
he ruffles louis hair with wry affection
feed on what you want mon cherie
rats chickens doves goats
ill leave you to it and watch you come round
just remember life without me would be even more unbearable
a sly pleasurable secret secret smile
their carriage draws up to the mansion as the first fingers of light spread across the sky
being a vampire to him meant revenge
revenge against life itself
every time he took a life it was revenge
and the slaves with a wisdom that was denied their masters began to notice
in a tiny cabin a slave family
kids sleeping on the floor in cribs and cots
the parents sleep on the bed young beautiful naked
beside them is lestat who is drinking the husbands blood his hand playing across the breast of the wife as he does so
she murmurs in her sleep
she grabs his fingers and kisses them thinking him to be her husband
lestat gently disengages himself and leaves
the womans scream pierces the sky as lestat walks into the night
every chicken is dead bloodies necks hanging down from the cribs
louis emerges from the entrance blood on his lips
he hears the scream
the sound of drumming is heard african primal
the woman runs through the quarters screaming grief
others gather at doorways restrain and console her
a beautiful elaborate eighteenth century dove cote
every dove inside is dead pierced at the neck
a black hand throws in a flaming torch and it bursts into flame
a doll made in the image of lestat is pierced with needles
bodies of slaves floating in the swamp with the bodies of goats
slaves at the edge throw ropes around the bodies pull them towards the shore
the drumming grows louder
louis walking through
the slaves hush as he approaches gather in doorways and whisper
he turns and looks at them sorrowfully
he looks truly like a ghost
their eyes turn away when they meet his
he walks on
lestat and louis sit at the table the untouched food between them
consider yourself lucky
in paris a vampire has to be clever for many reasons
here all one needs is a pair of fangs
you came from paris
as did the one who made me
tell me about him
you must have learnt something from him
it had to happen for you as it did for me
i learnt absolutely nothing
i wasnt give a choice remember
but you must know something about the meaning of it all you must know where we come from why we
lestat spits out in anger
why should i know these things
do you know them
the drumming grows outside
gripping his temples that noise
its driving me mad
weve been in the country for weeks with nothing but that noise
they know about us
they see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses
come the new orleans then
theres an opera on tonight
a real french opera
we can dine in splendor
i respect life dont you see
for each and every human life i have respect
respect me a little then
im the only life you know
lestat turns childishly petulantly
youll soon run out of chickens louis
he walks out humming a french aria
louis stares at his plate
the slaves gathered on mass around fires
frenzied drumming dancing
lestat rides through scattering the flames
the drumming stops
the slaves look towards the house
slowly they begin to move towards it
louis sitting in despair by the table
yvette the slave girl enters
you dont want any supper
louis laughs harshly
no ma cher
i need no supper
is all well at pointe du lac tonight
yvette draws closer
light reveals her beauty
we worry about you master
when do you ride about the fields
how long since youve been to the slave quarters
everywhere there is death
are you our master still at all
louis watches her sadly
hes getting hungry
her throat is long and slender her breasts are gorgeous
dazed leave me alone now yvette
i will not go unless you listen to me
send away this new friend of yours
the slaves are frightened of him
they are frightened of you
she comes closer and he can hear her beating heart
she touches his hair
he takes her hand and brings it to his lips
i am frightened of myself yvette
he kisses her wrist
she suddenly gasps sharply withdraws her hand
she sees her wrist is red with blood
she sees the blood on his lips
hush yvette she screams even louder
louis clamps his hand over her mouth
her hand grips the table cloth pulls bringing the empty glasses and crockery to the floor
in horror louis realizes he has broken her neck
he brings her cut wrist to his lips then drops it revolted
he carries her body outside grief stricken
the drumming grows louder
fires burning in the distance round the slave cabins
the slaves are gathered at the foot of the mansion steps
they see louis come out holding the body of yvette
he is deranged with grief
this place is cursed
damned do you hear me
and your master is the devil
he places the body of yvette in a rocking chair on the veranda
get out while you can
youre free men
they dont move
they stare at him blankly
unlike me you are no free men
he turns behind him and looks at the mansion all candelabra and chandeliers lighted all windows open
do i have to convince you
he rushed up the stairs snatches up the candelabra and sets fire to the drapes
he goes from window to window lighting drapes lace curtains everything
setting fire to the house
they rush up the stairs with shouts of stop him hes mad
a wall of flame gushes out from the interior blocking their way
louis wandering from room to room of the burning mansion
he sees paintings of his wife consumed by the flames
he is weakening with the fumes the heat
we can see this in his face the texture of his skin
suddenly a large french window cascades inwards and lestat stands there whip in hand
behind him we can see the morning sky
you fool what have you done
what you wouldnt do
its almost sunrise
it will be the sun or the fire
you said they can kill me
the sun or the fire
louis stands there weakened then collapses onto the floor
lestat darts forward and catches him before he drops
he runs out the shattered window carrying him on his shoulder
with many crypts
louis unconscious carried over lestats shoulder
louis lying on the floor of a large crypt
he slowly comes to
where are we
where do you think my idiot friend
were in a nice filthy cemetery
does this make you happy
is this fitting and proper enough
louis laughs softly
we belong in hell
and what if there is no hell or they dont want us there
ever think of that
the vampire sits in silence as if tired by his story
malloy speaks hesitantly
you loved yvette
can a vampire feel love
you loved your wife surely
i was human then
might as well ask can an angel feel love
both are blesses or cursed with a certain
though whether angels take as long to learn it as i i will never know
he looks directly at malloy shocking him with his gaze
yes i loved yvette
as i loved pointe du lac
and as with each thing i loved i destroyed it
from the sea at evening shrouded in mist
lestat i did not love
and he survived
a lavish little supper chamber with coffered bed fancy french furniture
open to rooftops of colonial city
louis sits by an open window looking out over the city
behind we can hear the laughter of lestat and tow female voices
louis turns and sees lestat in the main chamber with two drugged or drunked whores
one runs her finger down his chest
the other seems out of it
youre skins icy
he presses his thumb on her neck and holds her tight sinking his teeth into her neck
after a time she falls to the bed dead
he turns to the other
your friend has no head for wine
i can warm that cold skin of yours better than she can
do you think so
he rubs her breast
why youre warm now
ah but the price is pretty high
your sweet friend i exhausted her
he bites her in turn drinks her blood
she does into the swoon
louis looks on in disgust
im leaving you
i cant stand this any longer
lestat pulls away from the whore
what no flowery speeches
about what a monster i am
what a vulgar fiend
im not interested in you
you disgust me
im interested in my own nature and know i cant trust you to tell me the truth about me
what do you imagine you are louis
i dont pretend to know
dont you understand louis that you alone of all creatures can see death with impunity
you alone under the rising moon can strike like the hand of god
the girl moans
lestat shes alive
vampires are killers
predators whos all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment
the girl moans again open her eyes
the girl lestat i know
let her alone
he slashes her wrist with his teeth and lets the blood drip into a glass
you think you can be human
you think you can go back
but you cant
you live off the blood of rats now louis
how human is that
the girls moans again
lestat drinks that glass
lie still love
the girl begins to scream
lestat picks her up
youre tired love you want to sleep
he walks to his coffin puts her inside and sits on the lid
we hear muffled screaming and banging from inside
why do you do this lestat
i like to do it
i enjoy it
take you aesthetes taste to purer things
kill them swiftly if you will but do it
for now doubt you are a killer louis
he stands up
the girl pushes the lid off hysterical
she looks at louis
its a coffin a coffin
get me out
of course its a coffin
youre dead love
louis screams at lestat lestat finish this you finish her if you feel so much the girl grabs louis and pleads
you wont let me die will you
youll save me
but its too late love
look at your wrist you breast
he picks her up again
he turns to louis laughing
unless i make her one of us
the girl screams
louis puts his hands to his ears
then lestat in a fit of pique puts his teeth to her neck
she dies at last
a terrible silence descends
lestat looks at louis
to think you
are all i have to learn from
in the old world they called it the dark gift louis
and i gave it to you
louis leaves without a word
a rat scurried down a gutter then another and another
louis hand grabs the rat
we see him from behind walking down the street gripping one then another
am i damned
am i from the devil
is my very nature that of a devil
and all the while as these dreaded questions caused me to neglect my thirst my thirst grew hotter my veins were threads of pain in my flesh my temples throbbed
a smaller side street in which every house is marked with an x
the street is crawling with rats and louis is following them
a man passes with a lantern
dont go that way monsieur
its the plague
go back the way you came
louis smiles bitterly at these words repeating them to himself
the way i came
he walks on following the rats
and finally when i could stand it no longer i stood in an empty desolate street and heard the sound of a child crying
a house the door slightly open marked with an x
the sound of a child crying inside
louis walks towards it
a little girl pulling at a figure in a rocking chair
mama please wake up
mama im frightened please wake up
as louis enters he sees the woman is dead
her eyes are being eaten away by rats
louis gasps in horror
she is a radiant doll or angel as she stretches out her hand to louis
monsieur please help us
papas waiting for us at the ship
please wake mama monsieur
she runs to him
instinctively he gathers her in his arms
he looks down pitying on her beautiful face
and if i am damned why do i fell such pity for her gaunt face
why do i wish to warm her tiny arms
comfort her beating heart
she snuggles into him suddenly utterly secure
she tugs at his hair brings his head down towards her
and we see louis shiver as his lips go to her neck
her breathing becomes calm as she goes into the swoon
gradually another sound replaces it
suddenly louis backs away caught red handed the child in his arms
he sees lestat slapping his knee and laughing in the doorway
ah my philosopher my martyr
never take a human life
well you must admit it is funny
or is it merely touching
im not sure
louis stares at the unconscious claudia in horror then lets her slip gently into a chair
shamefully he wipes his mouth sees the tiny wounds on her throat
lestat snatches up the dead mother from the chair and begins to dance with her in great circles humming and talking
her head falls back
black water flows from her mouth
lets make some party of it shall we
maybe theres some life in the old lady yet
louis flees into the street
come back louis you are what you are
the plague would have got her within hours anyway
merciful death how you love your precious guilt
louis running through an assortment of streets
all the night life of new orleans flows by him
for years i had not savored a human
and when i had lestats words made sense to me
i knew peace only when i killed and when i heard her heart in that terrible rhythm i knew again what peace could be
yet even then i could not contenance it
fingers of light in the sky
louis pale and shivering walks splashing through the water
he comes to a huge sewer pipe crowded with rats
he crawls inside
the same sewer pipe
now the bodies of dead rats lie all around
a pair of fine leather boots splash through the water lestats
louis huddled there so pale and shivering he seems close to death
lestat comes through
all i need to find you louis is follow the corpses of rats
he bends down to him surprisingly gently and puts his own coat around him
pain is terrible for you
you feel it like no other creature because you are a vampire
you dont want it to go on
they emerge from the sewer and walk along the waterfront
do what it is in your nature to do
and you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms
oh god lestat
i felt peace
i felt an end to the craving
that and more
he puts his arm around louis to stop his shivering
evil is a point of view
god kills indiscriminately and so shall we
for no creatures under god are as we are none so like him as ourselves
is god merciless
greedy and cruel
ah but we have even more in common with our creator
come i am like a mother tonight
i want a child
louis is baffled
shes here your wounded one
what are you saying
you need company louis
more congenial than mine
lestat holds up a candle and walks towards a large four poster bed
claudia lies there angelic under the coverlet two marks on her neck
you remember how you wanted her the taste of her i didnt want to kill her
dont worry louis youre conscience is clear
you left her alive
lestat shakes her gently
claudia claudia listen to me
youre ill my precious and im going to give you what you need to get well
lestat what do you mean
louis runs at him but lestat brushes him aside effortlessly so he falls to the floor
lestat bites his wrist and presses the bleeding wound to the childs mouth
he winces in pain
thats it dear
you must drink it to get well
claudia sucks on the wound reviving making little noises like a person waking from sleep
louis rises to his feet as claudia clutches lestats arm sucking the blood fiercely
stop thats enough
he pulls her loose and she growls and stares at him with big clear astonished eyes
i want more
what have you done
lestat puts her down on the bed and sits beside her holding his wrist obviously in pain
yes cherie of course you want more
and ill show you how to get it
you drink from morals my beauty but from me
still suffering lestat pulls the bell rope
becoming white yet robust bright eyed yet crazed
she shakes her beautiful curls and the dust falls from them
they are shining in the candlelight
louis cannot stop looking at her
he does not notices as the maid enters
ah quelle belle enfant
the maid comes near the bed kneels in front of claudia
lestat lays his hand on the maids throat and claudia watches keenly
they are so innocent
they must not be made to suffer
claudia lunges for the throbbing vein in the neck locking on to the flowing blood
the maid is transfixed
close on louis his anguish his fascinated horror
you are the devil
you are the instrument of satan
thats enough cherie
stop before the heart stops
he lets the dead maid onto the floor
claudia looks at the corpse
i want some more
its bet in the beginning lest the death takes you down with it
yes thats it
my beloved child
lestat and claudia sit on the louis xvi settee
claudia is a vision a doll made out of pearl
animated voice crisp
where is mamma
the words echo in louis head as he puts his hands to his ears
mammas gone to heaven cherie like that sweet lady over there
they all go to heaven
and you did very well cherie
not a drop spilt
youre going to be our child now
lestat takes out his comb and begins to comb her hair
your mamas left you with us
she wants you to be happy
whispers you are the devil
you are the instrument of satan
do you want to frighten our little daughter
im not your daughter
yes you are my dearest
you are mine and louis daughter
you see louis was going to leave us
he was going to go away
but now hes not
hes going to stay and make you happy
claudia runs over to him
she smiles at him
louis is conflicted
he cannot leave her
he touches her cheeks her hair
same as his
vampire skin and hair
he draws in his breath shocked by her beauty then he embraces her as a father might a daughter
he looks over her shoulder to lestat
lestat smiles one happy family
malloy is open mouthed
a child vampire
he sees the tape has run out
he rapidly and clumsily sticks in another
shall we go on
he did it to make you stay with him
he knew me
he knew i would love her more than the waking world
but there was more to it than that
perhaps in the end he did it to show me that he could
for he lavished affection on her there was no doubt about that
life was very different with madame claudia as you can imagine
two husky movers bring in furniture through the back courtyard past the fountain and the banana trees up the back stairs and into striped wallpaper gives way to flowers in
huge four poster beds in the bedrooms and large chests as big as coffins standing against the wall
everywhere there are candles and pretty louis xvi furniture
lestat gives instructions to the movers
we see claudia draped in lace standing on a petit point chair as a dressmaker measure out a garment
louis can be seen in an inner room
monsieur i need more light
i shall go slind if you do not bring me a lamp or let me fit this child during the day
she has pricked her hand
a spot of blood appears on her finger claudia takes her hand
let me kiss it better
claudia brings the hand to her lips
the dressmaker abruptly pulls her finger away in pain again
closeup her finger two holes showing
a little child she was but also a fierce killer now capable of the ruthless pursuit of blood with all a childs demanding
lestat walks through sees the dressmaker lying dead at claudias feet claudia still on the chair in the half finished dress
claudia claudia will you never learn
who will we get now to finish your dress
a little practicality cherie
she would sleep in my coffin daily curl her childs fingers round my hair as she dreamt of i know not what
claudia and louis sleeping in a coffin together claudias fingers curling his hair
claudia playing with dolls each as perfect and beautifully dressed as she is
mute and beautiful she played with dolls dressing them and undressing them by the hour
claudia tinkling with her childs hands on the piano picking out a hesitant tune
mute and beautiful she killed
and to watch her kill was chilling
the tinkling of claudias piano is heard over a well dressed lady walking through a square lit by gaslight
the lady hears a childs sobbing and stops turns
claudia the picture of lost innocence sitting on a bench and crying
why are you crying child
the woman all solicitude goes to claudia
are you lost my love
hush now dont cry well find her
the woman takes claudia in her arms
claudia nestles her head in her shoulder her teeth near her neck
they found death fast in those days before she learnt to play with the to delay the moment till she had taken what she wanted
a stern stiff piano teacher male beating time with a ruler as claudia picks out scales on the piano
he raps her on the knuckles
the thumb girl
mind the thumb
claudia glares at him then returns to playing improving rapidly
piano music over
mozart now well played
claudia staring at a glass case inside of which are an array of eighteenth century dolls
an old dollmaker looks down on her
they are expensive my dear
maybe too expensive for a young girl like you
claudia walking along clutching the doll
the dollmaker lying dead two puncture marks in his throat his dolls scattered all around him
claudia and louis looking through the window at a display of coffins
claudia point at the smallest one
she grew yet stayed the same
she wanted a bed of her own yet would climb back into mine
the childs coffin on the floor
the lid lifts
claudia emerges yawning wanders through the flat into where his coffin sits
she slides the lid off and curls in beside him
claudia playing the piano now with remarkable dexterity
the piano teacher sits mute beside her
as she plays he topples over and falls to the ground
we see the puncture marks in his neck
lestat hearing the noise comes in
didnt i tell you never in the house
claudia smiles to herself keeps playing
canaries sing in a cage above a childs coffin
claudia is writing at a secretaire
she is writing in a diary with a quill pen in an adult hand
she murmurs the date as she writes
september st one hour after sunset
the sky is still violet the way louis loves and as always lestat was gone when we rose
she looks up and sees louis in the doorway watching her
how did you learn to write claudia
the way i learn everything
by watching you
she closes the diary
but you never let me see you kill louis
lestat taught you all you need to know about that
infant death he calls me
sweet daughter death
you know what he calls you
why does he call you that
hush claudia dont talk about such things
show me your book
she opens it
inside there is a beautiful pen and ink portrait of louis
you did that
its not finished she begins to fill in the sketch
time can pass fast for mortals when theyre happy
with us it was the same
street lamps are oil at this period
houses are now tall two story spanish style
streets are flagstone
passing carriages are black
it was a very different life
and a new century was beginning
what had once been a small godforsaken french colony was growing into a great port giving us an endless train of magnificent strangers
claudia louis and lestat dressed in the same clothes walking through a raucous carnival with sideshows
crowd milling around sailors whores children thieves freed slaves indians
they pass a wild west display jugglers fire eaters three card tricksters
all human life was here for the taking
and we took all three of us in our different ways
they come to a raised platform where a troupe of perfectly formed midgets do a burlesque show
she stares at these small perfect creatures like herself intrigued and troubled
louis and lestat walk on not noticing as circles the troupe
she comes to a small tent behind it
at the entrance stands a midget youth
you want to come inside lovely
claudia walks up to him
ever been kissed
claudia shakes her head
he kisses her
claudia allow her to be kissed then bites his tongue
he youth struggles as claudia holds him and drains him
she lets him go as louis appears behind her
shes like me louis
small and yet not small at all
louis hurriedly draws her away
i watched her grow yet stay the same her doll like face possessed of adult eyes eerie powerful seductive
claudia playing the piano now like a demonic liszt
lestat appears in the doorway
he has a big box in his arms
i have ten you realize
focus on early th century french dolls wood glass wax bisque all around the bedroom on chairs on the bed
some newish some tattered old
well i thought you could use another
he hands her the box
it is a fine parisian jumeau doll
she likes it and stokes its face
why always on this night
what do you mean
you always give me the doll on the same night of the year
i didnt realize
is this my birthday
he examines the other dolls
some of these are so old and tattered
you should throw them away
or there would be twice as many
but youre the fairest by far
you dress me like a doll
you make my hair like a doll
lestat doesnt answer
claudia stands up quickly and strides out into the where louis is reading by the window
she walks to a mirrored cabinet takes out a scissors and begins cutting her hair
you want me to be a doll forever
claudia dont why not
she continues cutting
she sees lestat emerge from her bedroom in the mirror behind her then turns to him an angelic little boys face now with soft curls around her face
cant i change like everybody else
she walks past him back into her bedroom and slams the door
louis looks from the mass of blonde hair on the floor to lestat
then a horrid scream pierces the silence
more screams which become roars
she stands before the dressing table all her long hair grown back over her shoulders
she holds it with both hands screaming and screaming
lestat and louis come through the door
which of you did it
which of you made me the way i am
what you are
you would be something other than you are
and if i cut my hair again
it will grow back again
but it wasnt always so
i had a mother once
and louis he had a wife
he was mortal the same as she
and so was i
claudia she turns on lestat
you made us what we are didnt you
stop her louis
she runs at him with the scissors scoring his face
the cut heals
she scores it again
it heals again
she stares at him in horror
whispering how did you do it
and why should i tell you
its in my power
why yours alone
tell me how it was done
be glad i made you what you are
youd be dead not if i hadnt
he storms out
louis goes to claudia and picks her up in his arms
tenderly were immortal
youve always known that
tell me why
youve got to tell me
louis carries her outside onto the porch
there is an old flower seller going by
you see the old woman
that will never happen to you
youll never grow old
you will never die
and it means something else too doesnt it
i shall never ever grow up
she clutches louis desperately
i hate him
but i cannot bear to lose you
youre the only companion i have forever
you taught me everything i know
please tell me louis
tell me how it came to be that i am this
louis strokes her beautiful face her hair
ive something to show you
louis walking holding claudia as if he was about to lose her
though everything was changed through the years had warped the contours of the streets i found my way there aware that id always known where it was and avoided it
not wanting to pass the doorway where id first heard claudia cry
louis back in the same street outside the same house
he stands with claudia at the window
there is a family inside a picture of domestic tranquility
i heard you crying
you were there in a room with your mother
you were hugging her for warmth crying pitifully as you had been for days
because your mother was dead
claudia stares at him suddenly very cold very alert
i opened the shutters
i came into the room
i felt pity for you
pity but something else
he cant go on
claudias eyes are remorseless
fed on me
and he found me with you
i ran sickened at what id done
then he cut his wrist and fed you from him
i tried to stop him but you were a vampire then
and have been every night hereafter
you both did it
i took your life
he gave you another one
claudia speaks through indrawn breath
and here it is
and i hate you both
malloy and louis
but why did you tell her
how could i not
she had to know
and did you lose her
did she go
where would she have gone
she was a child and beautiful heartbreaking merciless child
and i had made her that
louis walking the streets shivering
i walked all night
i walked as i walked years before when my mind swam with guilt at the thought of killing
i found myself at the cathedral
a cathedral rising out of the mist the doors open
i thought of all the things i had done and couldnt undo
and i longed for one seconds peace
louis walks towards the doors inside
the dim lights of candles
a sacristan tending the altar an old woman praying otherwise empty
i had no fear
if anything i longed for something to happen for the stones to tremble as i entered the foyer
louis walking down the nave of the church
he stops by the alter
i almost genuflected from old habit
i almost prayed
louis sits in a pew
and then it struck me
the cross the statues the tabernacle
what if the statues gave an image to nothing
what if i was the supernatural in this cathedral
the only immortal under this roof
and i felt nothing but loneliness
loneliness to the point of madness
suddenly a hand is laid on his shoulder
louis almost jumps
he turns and sees the face of a grey haired priest
you wish to go to confession
i was about to lock up the church
louis stares at him tears in his eyes
you are troubled arent you
can i help
its too late too late no its never too late
the priest gestures to the confessional
louis rises slowly
louis kneeling in the darkness
the hatch slides back
bless me father for i have sinned so often and so long i dont know how to change nor beg for forgiveness
son god is infinite in his capacity to forgive
tell him from your heart
murders father death after death
the woman who died two nights ago in jackson square i killed her
and thousands of others before her
i have walked the streets of new orleans like the grim reaper
and fed on human life for my own
i am a vampire father and have turned the one i love most of all into on too the hatch slams down
louis rises confused and the door is flung open the priest stands there
do you know the meaning of sacrilege
then there is no mercy
his face comes into the light
the priest steps back open mouthed
you talk of sacrilege
why if god exists does he suffer me to exist
he bares his fangs
the priest runs screaming
gets to the bellrope begins to ring the bell
louis swoops on him
why does he suffer me to live
louis takes him lifting him from the floor till his feet stop kicking
louis enters silently like a corpse
he hears a voice behind him
locked together in hatred he turns sees her sitting in the darkness
she is wearing a tiny nightgown of stitched lace and pearls weirdly adult and seductive
she comes towards him
but i cant hate you louis
she sprays perfume over her body as she comes nearer
is this the aroma of a mortal child
she kisses his cheek
i was mortal to you
you gave me your immortal kiss
you became my mother and my father
and so im yours
she takes his face in her hands
but nows the time to end it louis
nows the time to leave him
hell never let us go
a sailing ship by the docks
louis and claudia talking to a shipping clerk
so we made plans
she was convinced there were others of our kind in europe that they would have the answers lestat couldnt provide
lestat whom she now hated who she thought she could be free of
i doubted but then she had a surprise in store
lestat playing the piano
claudia enters wearing a cape and hat
she walks to the piano sits at the end of the piano and stares at him as he plays
what is it now
you irritate me
your very presence irritates me
sweetly does it
and ill tell you something else
ive met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you
is that supposed to frighten me
youre spoilt because youre an only child
you need a brother
or i do
im weary of you both
i suppose we could people the world with vampires the three of us
not you my dear
youre a liar
but you upset my plans
i came to make peace with you even if youre the father of lies
i want things to be as they were
louis perks up puzzled
stop pestering me then
i must do more than that
ive brought a present for you
then i hope its a beautiful woman with endowments you will never possess
claudia stares at him for a moment
better than that
she takes his hand and leads him into an inner room
louis follows behind
you havent fed enough
i can tell by your color
two beautiful youths lying asleep on a couch by a table full with a half eaten meal
oh claudia youve outdone yourself
where did you find them
drunk on brandy wine
i thought of you when i saw them
we forgive each other then
claudia stares at him sitting
lestat bites into the neck of one of the youths sucks greedily and horribly
claudia watches him without expression
he finished one is about to take the other when he staggers
he looks at claudia
you gave them absinthe
lestat stares wildly at her tries to move towards her then slips to the floor
it killed them unfortunately
but it keeps the blood warm
lestat tries to rise
ah louis louis she killed them
and let me drink
louis watches appalled
he goes to move
dont louis louis put me in my coffin
ill put you in your coffin
she pulls a knife out from under her shawl walks rapidly to him and slashes his throat
blood explodes from it
dont do this thing
louis louis i gave you the gift help me claudia lacerates his face
blood pours from everywhere
she plunges the knife in his chest
he falls back fangs bared clutching the knife
claudia leaps on him then bites deep into his neck as he dies
louis screams runs forward pulls her away
what have you done claudia he drags her off lestat tries to pull her out of the room
she hisses at him
look whats happening to him
the floor is a sea of blood
lestat has begun to shrivel as if hed been a bag of blood
his skin is shriveling against his bones like parchment his eyes are slipping back into his skull like face
his lush beautiful hair remains unchanged
but his clothes are virtually being emptied of the body
it is no more than bones wrapped in paper and the pupils of the eyes suddenly roll up into the papered skull
oh god forgive us
dont mock me louis
she stares at the shriveled skeleton in its skin wrapping
she is fascinated
she sees the vampiric blood flow all over the floor
she touches it and brings her finger to her lips
goodnight sweet prince may flights of devils wing you to your rest
louis walks forward touches the skeleton the blonde hair
hes dead claudia dead
the one good lesson he taught me louis
never drink from the dead
she stands up all business suddenly
we must get rid of him
she drags the coverlet from the table knocking the crockery over the dead youths and wraps lestats skeleton in it
she takes a bunch of chrysanthemums and places them in his skeleton hands
should we burn him
what would he have liked louis
dont mock claudia
louis whipping the horses
claudia beside him
lestats skeleton in the back with the bodies of the two dead youths
in europe louis
we shall meet our own kind
find the one who made him
learn what it means
and suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing and it goes back nothing proceeding from nothing until there is nothing
and we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge
the carriage pulls up by a swamp
and if we find the one who made him
do we tell him we destroyed his own creation
the vampire lestat
louis drags out the bodies of the boys
he slides them into the waters of the swamp
we see ripples in the water and the churning of alligators as they attack the corpses
louis takes lestats skeleton in his arms
he slides it into the waters
the alligators speed towards it
he belongs with those reptiles louis
he deserved to die
then maybe so do we
every night of our lives
he was my brother
he gave me this life whatever it is
i did it for us louis
so we could be free
he stands there saying nothing
louis look at me
bitterly i cant
go away from me
claudia is shocked to her core
she steps back
louis stares at the rippling waters
gradually the movement of alligators stops
then he hears a sound he hasnt heard in years
he turns sees claudia sitting by a cypress tree like a little girl for the first time in years
she is weeping copiously
claudia youre crying we see her face tears of blood running down it
she is heartbroken lost
you never talked to me like that in all these years
and you never cried i cant bear it when you do i would die rather than lose you louis
i would die the way he died
louis gathers her in his arms
hush claudia hush now my dear tell me you dont hate me louis
i did it for you louis walks her towards the carriage
i love you claudia
and we are free now claudia
just the two of us beginning the great adventure of our lives
he lifts her into the carriage and drives off leaving the silent waters of the swamp
sturdy mulatto workmen lifting cases and trunks out of the apartment
all the furniture is covered in white sheets
claudia dressed in a cap and hat is playing the piano by the light of one remaining oil lamp
louis comes from her room with the cage of canaries
we forgot about the birds
theres nothing for it but to let them go
he opens the cage and the canaries fly around the room
there is a knocking on the door
what was that
the workmen must have a trunk dont stop cherie he goes downstairs
claudia plays a moment then stops perturbed
she goes to the window
then sees something out there that makes her face go white
louis walking to the door
the knocking gets louder
claudia runs for the stairs after louis
louis reaches the door
the knocking gets louder
he opens the door as reaches the stairs
she screams dont louis but louis has opened the door
he looks back at claudia puzzled then at the door again when swooping into his vision comes the nightmare image of in filthy swamp soaked rags robust again but his
flesh shriveled covered in scars his eyes riddled bloodshot
louis throws his body against the door slamming it on lestats reaching hand
the hand withdraws as lestat roars
louis bolts the door
louis runs up the stairs sweeps claudia in his arms watching appalled as the door shudders with the force of lestats body
louis runs through with claudia in his arms
it cant be it is
take the back stairwell suddenly lestat crashes through the casement window scattering blood everywhere reefing himself on the shattered glass
he tumbles to the floor and gets unsteadily to his feet
louis throws claudia behind him and hurls himself on lestat who fights like a ravening animal bits of his broken body coming off in the process
then with a terrifying effort lestat hurls louis off goes for claudia who grabs the poker from the fireplace scatters burning coals over him
he falls back then comes at her again as the drapes catch fire
louis grabs the lamp
stay back for the love of god
or ill burn you alive
lestat lunges again at claudia
louis hurls the lamp which explodes him in flame
lestat screams in agony whirls around the room then comes on claudia again
she hurls another lamp
louis throws the flaming sheets around him wrapping him further in fire
lestat falls to his knees choking hands up over his face in the smoke
the whole parlor is afire
louis gathers up claudia smothering the burning house carries her down the back stairs through the carriage way and through the gathering crowds of mortals into the street
louis running with claudia in his arms
he looks back at the flames of the house
sound of a ships horn
the ship is sailing without us
holding her tightly louis runs
louis stands at the railings in the morning mist as the ship moves down the river
with flame lighting up the sky
though the fire seemed to spread through the quartier i stood on that deck until dawn fearful he would come out again of the very river like some monster to
destroy us both
and all the while i thought lestat we deserve your vengeance
you gave me the dark gift
and i delivered you into the hands of death for the second time
louis and malloy
did he die in the fire
he was dead to us
we were free
that was all that mattered
the ship shrouded in mist
though the ship was blessedly free of rats a strange plague nonetheless struck its passengers
a body is slipped into the sea
a priest reads last rites to a mourning family
trunks and cases creaking with the ships movement
dead rats everywhere
claudia and i alone seemed immune
we kept to ourselves pondering the mystery of lestat and the greater mystery of each other
passing through the straits of gibralter
we reached the mediterranean
i wanted those waters to be blue
they were black nighttime waters and how i suffered then straining to remember the color that a young mans senses had taken for granted that my memory had let slip
away for eternity
it was black off the coast of italy black off the coast of greece europe itself was black
claudia sitting with an easel and sketch pad sketching the bay of naples
a beautifully realized drawing all in shades of grey and black
louis your quest is for darkness only
this sea is not your sea
they myths of men are not your myths
their history isnt yours
the sketch changes to a sketch of in the moonlight
we saw the acropolis by moonlight shades of grey and silver
and i longed for the brilliant white of those marbles in the hot sun of homer
the sketch changes to a sketch of and the traditional shapes of the vampire landscape
we docked at varna and searched the rural countryside of the carpathians for what she liked to term our kind
the quest for these old world vampires filled me with bitterness
we searched village after village ruin after ruin and i was glad when always we found nothing
for what could the damned really have to say to the damned
malloy and louis
you found nothing
peasant rumors superstitions about garlic crosses stakes in the hear all that how do you say again
but one of our kind
not a whisper
no vampires in transylvania
no count dracula
fictions my friend
the vulgar fictions of a demented irishman
so we repaired to paris
crowds and gaslight everywhere
carriages horses opera coming from the opera house
i think the very name of paris brought a rush of pleasure to me that was extraordinary
i was a creole after all and paris was the mother of new orleans a universe whole and entire unto herself
the high walls of the louvre dark figures walking in pairs through the shadowy tulieries
claudia in furtrimmed muff and bonnet peers through the glass at a display of dolls
each doll in there seems to resemble her with blonde hair and blue eyes
she peers deep into the shop and sees madeleine a young woman bent over a workbench painting a dolls face oblivious to being watched
louis and claudia hurrying hand in hand with a crowd of mortals towards the sound of an orchestra turning beyond
claudia and louis standing in the deep shadows looking at the branching arches
louis is overcome with sadness claudia is fascinated
louis and claudia walk among a series of mythological nudes by poussin
claudia surrounded by discarded dresses and outfits being attended by couturiers
all the clothes are tiny to fit her frame but have an adult cut and shape
we were alive again
we were in love and so euphoric was i that i yielded to her every desire
full of late th century furniture lots of empire style regency gilt velvet and brocade
against a wall solemn among all the light and glitter
by a large gilt mirror in her new clothes
she is covered with jewelry fixing earrings to her ears
help me mon chere
louis walks over helps her with the earrings
how do i look
still my beautiful child
a beautiful child
is that what you still think i am
he turns away
why do you turn away
why dont you look
she twirls looking at herself in the mirror then stops stares at herself
you want me to be your daughter forever dont you
well tell me papa
what was it like making love
louis is stunned
you dont remember
or you never knew
it was something hurries
and seldom savored
something acute that was quickly lost
it was the pale shadow of killing
but how will i ever know louis
she stares at him through the mirror
ill never find them will i
my own kind
louis and claudia walk along a boulevard like father and daughter
all around them are bourgeois parisian families on their evening stroll
claudia points at the children that pass
have i anything in common with her louis
she points to a beautiful french child walking by with her mother
or her or her or any of them
claudia you torture yourself
they are ducklings that will grow into swans
whereas i must be the duckling forever
you are more beautiful than any of them
we see madeleine inside painting a dolls face
louis and claudia arrive outside
all her dolls resemble me
claudias face with the dolls in the background
the resemblance is uncanny
are they my kind louis
dolls never change either
you are neither claudia
now stop this madeleine sees claudia from inside
you know her
should i take her louis
among her dolls
make a doll of her in turn
he takes her arm
but claudia shakes him off and moves into the shop
louis walks briskly head bowed
for a time we had been almost human in the sensual whirl of what paris had to offer
but the human delights of that city only served to remind her of the ageless child she had become
i felt her pain as i walked until i become aware that i was being followed
a step echoes his
turns sees nothing
then walks again
the echoing steps begin again
sees a shadow flitting
he walks again hears the same effect
then he stops
he stares at a gaslamp opposite
so it was when i had given up the search for vampires that a vampire found me
santiago a tall vampire materializes under the gaslight
and louis gradually realizes that this vampire has assumed the same attitude posture clothes and hair style as louis
louis gives an involuntary shake of the head
louis takes a step forwards
louis folds his arms
you mean me harm
a beat later you mean me harm
santiago echoes the first word but not the second
louis has broken his composure
he turns his back on santiago only to come face to face with santiago right in front of him
again louis turns this back to find santiago facing him
louis turns glowers refusing to look at him
ive searched the world for an immortal and this is what i find
slowly he looks up
santiago draws close breaking the mirror trick and suddenly slams louis back against the wall
louis is furious
he regains his balance strikes out at santiago and when santiago vanishes to reappear behind him louis slams back his elbow into his midriff
santiago staggers amazed and then rushes at louis throwing him down
louis rolls back to his feet then to his amazement sees two vampires on in front on behind
he looks both ways then sees one has vanished
he stares awestruck at this new one he looks like an angel
you are all right
he reaches into his waistcoat takes an engraved invitation out of his pocket and thrusts it at louis
louis reads it aloud as we see by special invitation friday p
bring the petit beauty with you
no one will harm you
i wont allow it
remember my name
armand bows and vanishes
louis listens to the silence
louis formally dressed with claudia in rich attire on his arm
they pass people buying tickets for the theatre and go inside
remember what ive told you
theyll have different powers
theyll read your thoughts if you allow it
they draw close to reading by edgar allen poe the posters are illustrated with cliched images of vampires overcoming damsels in distress
but this cant be real
this is nonsense
nonsense all right
but something tell me its going to be the strangest nonsense weve ever seen
warily they show their invitations to the mortal ticket taker at the door
he glances away indifferently
claudia and louis look at the crowd as the lights go down
mortals mortals everywhere
and lots of drops to drink
they are here
i know they are
listen for something that doesnt make a sound
stage curtain rises
an elaborate painted set of an italianate castle
death standing before it the traditional image of the grim reaper complete with magnificent scythe
whispers its a vampire
its the one i saw in rue st jacques
a version of the poe story unfolds before them
all of the participants are vampires
all beautiful gleaming white aged or
they use no paint
and the audience think it is paint
how devilishly clever
a spotlight uncovers a mortal woman suddenly forced out upon the stage
shes no vampire
she doesnt know where she is
the audience laughs uneasily then stops as the mortal woman comes into the footlights
she is too beautiful too confused
santiago as death advances on her
she backs away terrified then sees the other vampires in a phalanx advancing from behind in a half circle
i dont want to die
she looks around in panic
santiago swoons arms over his breast as if he is hopelessly in love
we are death
the mortal woman steps to the footlights
someone help me
what have i done
louis whispers to claudia
this is no performance
and no one knows but us
we all die
death is the one thing you share with all those here
santiago gestures to the audience
but im young
death is no respecter of age
he can come any time any place
need i tell you what fate has in store for you
i would take my chance
let me go
and if you take that chance and live what is your fate
the humpbacked toothless visage of old age
santiago approaches her and tears the drawstring out of her peasant blouse
it opens completely and starts to slip
she tries to catch it but gently stops her wrists
the blouse falls exposing her young breasts
this is monstrous
yes and very beautiful
just as this flesh is pink now it will turn grey and wrinkle with age
let me live please
i dont care
then why should you care if you die now
she shakes her head confused
he catches her wrists behind her back
is awestruck by her beauty her suffering
draws near her cheek
and suppose death had a heart to love and to release you
to whom would he turn his passion
would you pick a person from the crowd there
a person to suffer as you suffer
a young girl cries out in jest
oh yes take me monsieur vampire
i adore you
audience roars with laughter
you wait your turn
the audience laughs again
the mortal woman shakes her head in panic
well have you a sister a mother a daughter you would send in your place
even she is repelled by the cruelty
she shakes her head
shakes her head
she is helpless
we alone can give death meaning
do you know what it means to be loved by death to become our bride
mortal woman looks up on the verge of hysteria or fainting
but then her eyes mist over
she is being entranced
we realize she is looking past santiago at the divinely beautiful armand who has just stepped out of the wings
armand has entranced her
he passes santiago
santiago stiffens but yields the stage
armand takes her by the naked shoulders
your beauty is a gift to us
armand gestures to the others who slowly gracefully close in
who deserves such a gift
he pulls the drawstring from her skirt and it falls revealing her nakedness
but she is spellbound
armand embraces her drinks her naked body stark against her black clothes then he passes her to the other vampires one by one
who battles desire and hunger with anger
ive seen enough of this
i loathe it
the naked mortal woman lies dead on the floor
the vampires seem to vanish one by one
as the curtain draws across the audience loudly applauds what they presume are theatrical tricks
the audience milling towards the exits
they talk in vacuous terms about the beauty of the show the symbolism of it the daring of it as they leave
gradually louis and claudia are left alone in the empty theatre
louis seems anxious to leave
claudia whispers in his ear
he looks around the empty theatre more eerie now than when the play was on
the red curtain shifts slightly in a hidden breeze a candle sputters and dies in a box
then the candle flares again and we see armand in the box looking down on them
he stares with a dreamy expression saying nothing
weve been searching for you for a very long time
his voice echoes eerily
armand gestures for them to follow him
armand leading louis and claudia following
it opens into a walls are painted with famous copies of durer brueghel goya and bosch depictions of death
fine wooden coffins line the walls
candles burn in sconces casting alternate shadows and pools of light
armand walks through gesturing louis and claudia to follow him
as they walk through vampire man and women appear out of the shadows like wraiths startling them drifting around them stroking them touching claudia as if she were a doll
shrieks of preternatural laughter
armand gestures to the vampires to back off
all obey but estelle
such a darling
she menaces claudia her breasts enormous her fangs bared
armand throw her a look and she is flung against the wall
louis stares around
the vampires faces drift towards him and away always disclosing the face of armand who seems some distance away but strangely close staring at louis with a constantly calm hypnotic
then a young mortal boy comes from the shadows with a candelabra which he hands to armand
armand and the boy come towards them leading them along the walls his candelabra illuminating the ghastly murals his face gleaming like an angel above the candleflame
yes and very beautiful
your lips they didnt move
they did but too fast for you to see them
no magic just grace and speed
the boy is watching louis
armands hand beckons and the boy draws up to louis in the candlelight
he places his arms on louis shoulders
louis glances at armand who smiles
louis sees the puncture marks on the boys neck
he wants you
louis is utterly confused
drinks his blood
the boys body presses against him sensual willing
the other vampires appear all around louis who suddenly senses it and draws away ashamed
claudia watches warily from a distance
armand beckons at her and louis and open a door in the wall which reveals a stone staircase
medieval chairs table an old coffin a bed in one corner a blazing fire
a medieval painting of satan being banished from heaven above the fire
armand places the boy on the bed settling him so he sleeps
disappointing isnt it
to come so far and find so little
jaded ingenues amusing themselves with make believe
we had feared we were the only ones
but how did you come into existence
he glances at louis then at claudia who averts her eyes
you dont want to answer
two vampires from the new world come to guide us into the new era as all we love slowly rots and fades away
are you the leader of this group
if there were a leader i would be the one
claudia stares at him constantly guarded
so you have the answers
you have questions
what are we
nothing if not vampires
who made us what we are
surely you know the one who made you
but the one who made him who made the one who made him the source of all this evil
louis looks at the picture
armand watches him
that is a picture nothing more
you mean we are not children of satan
he smiles at louis
a smile of infinite compassion
i saw you in the theatre your suffering your sympathy for that girl
i saw you with the boy
you die when you kill you feel you deserve to die and you stint on nothing
but does that make you evil
or since you comprehend what you call goodness does it not make you good
then there is nothing
he passes his finger through the candle flame
and perhaps this is the only real evil left
then god does not exist
i have not spoken to him
and no vampire here has discourse with god or the devil
none that ive ever known
i know nothing of god or the devil i have never seen a vision nor learnt a secret that would damn or save my soul
and as far as i know after four hundred years i am the oldest living vampire in the world
he stares at them his face angelic hypnotic young
his eyes hold them both in a trance
so its as i always feared
nothing leading to nothing
you fell too much
so much you make me feel
he stares from claudia to louis
he seems to be reading their souls
the one who made you should have told you this
the one who left the old world for the new
he knew nothing
he just didnt care
you mean he is
claudia appears suddenly to louis shoulder interrupting
its time we were on our way
im hungry and the city waits
she stares hard at armand
armand looks from her to louis
so soon to go
he seems genuinely regretful
but claudia pulls louis out
louis and claudia feel their way through darkened corridors trying to find their way out
the place was dark as we left a darkness that confounded even claudia
and as we blundered through it again came the thought i have wronged lestat i have hated him for the wrong reasons
suddenly a light comes on
they see they are in the empty theatre
santiago stands on the stage under a candle
how did you wrong him
louis is stunned
you read my thoughts
you said a name a name i dont want to say again
i seemed to recognize it
other vampires appear behind him
there is but one crime among us vampires here
he looks at claudia
you should know who are so secretive about the vampire who made you
it is the crime that means death to any vampire
to kill your own kind
i was so afraid it was to be born like venus out of the foam as we were
come louis lets go
claudia and louis enter the lobby
i loathe them
i cant stand the sight of them
stupid bourgeois parisians all dressed in black like some private club
ive searched for them the world over and i despise them
i can feel it from them
they want to know who made us what became of him
they have their rules their idiotic rules
they come to their room enter
louis closes the door behind him
do you think i would let them harm you
no you would not louis
danger hold you to me
love holds you to me
and we are in danger not you
she smiles at him
a strange sad adult smile
you would leave me for armand if he beckoned you
he wants you as you want him
hes been waiting for you
he wants you for a companion
he bides his time that place
he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do
thats not so
do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word
when he put me in that trance
so you felt it too
let him go he said
let him go
she touches his face
is that what i should do louis
let you go
my louis who made me
there are tears in her eyes
louis lifts her up in his arms
he can protect us claudia
you really believe that
claudia staring at the dolls
we see madeleine inside painting a doll
she sees claudia and smiles and waves
louis sitting alone in the box as the curtains draw back to show santiago as death as before
louis takes advantage of the darkness to slip away
armand opens the door to louis knock
i was waiting for you
listen to me
he follows armand into the room
claudia is dear to me
no my beloved my child
if you say so
you are innocent
im not innocent
but im afraid
she feels shes in danger from the others
i could give you reasons
its forbidden to make so young so helpless that cannot survive on its own
then blame the one who made her
did you kill this vampire who made you both
is that why you wont say his name
santiago thinks you did
we want no quarrel with him
its already begun
if you want to save her send her away
then i leave too
without any of those answers you so longed for
you said there were none
but you asked the wrong questions
do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality
how quickly they perish of their own will
we can do that
you would never give up life
if the world were reduced to one empty cell on fragile candle you stay alive and study it
you see too clearly
you see too much
thats what the one who made me said
how he must have loved you
armand suddenly grips louis close to him
louis i need you more than he ever did
i need a link with this century
the world changes
we do not
therein lies the irony that ultimately kills us
i need you to make contact with this age
louis laughs bitterly
dont you see
im not the spirit of any age
im at odds with everything and always have been
im not even sure what i am
but louis that is the very spirit of your age
the heart of it
you fall from grace has been the fall of a century
louis is stunned
and the vampires of the theatre
like moths around the candle of the age
they cant reflect anything
but you do
you reflect its broken heart
louis is speechless
are these not the answers you came for
a vampire with a human soul
an immortal with a mortals passion
you are beautiful my friend
lestat must have wept when he made you lestat
you knew lestat
yes i knew him
knew him well enough not to mourn his passing
he takes louis by the arm leads him towards the back wall
but you must go now
you must get her safely out of paris
he opens a hidden door in the wall
no one else knows of this door
when you knock you will find me waiting
louis in the street outside as the door closes behind him
i felt a kind of peace at last
i had found the teacher which lestat could never i knew now have been
i knew knowledge would never be withheld by armand
it would pass through him as through a pane of glass
and i knew claudia must leave me
there is unfamiliar scent in the air a doll sitting by the mirror
louis looks in the mirror and sees
the doll maker resplendent in green taffeta sitting like a madonna with claudia on her lap
claudias arms are wound round her neck
the contrast between mortal woman and immortal child is plain
louis is shy
madeleine rises and comes towards louis
she draws back the lace fringes round her throat so he can see the two marks there
she says softly dreamily
louis turns away
claudia speaks icy from the bed
do it louis
because i cannot do it
i havent the strength
you saw to that when you made me
louis turns to madeleine
you havent the vaguest conception under god of what you ask
au contraire monsieur i have
louis pushes her away
you have found your new companion louis
you will make me mine
louis grips madeleine and shakes her
how do we seem to you
do you think us beautiful magical our white skin our fierce eyes
drink you ask me
have you any idea of the thing you will become
your evil is that you cannot be evil
and i will suffer for it no longer
dont make me claudia
i cannot do it
yet you could do it to me
snatching me from my mothers hands like two monsters in a fairy tale
couldnt you have waited
six more years and i would have had that shape
and now you weep
you havent tears enough for what youve done to me
she points to madeleine you give her to me
do this before you leave me
she begins to weep sobbing like a child
i love you still thats the torment of it
but you know i must leave you louis
and who will care for me my love my dark angel when you are gone
louis looks at madeleine you promise to care for her then
and you know what you ask for
she wraps her arms around claudia
what do you think she is madeleine
a child who cant die
her finger clutches a locket around her neck louis touches it opens it
a picture of a young girl claudias age wistful beautiful
softly and the child who did die
louis takes her chin in his hand gently
look at the gaslight
dont take your eyes off it
you will be drained to the point of death but you must stay alive
do you hear me
louis pulls her to him and starts to drink her blood
louis on the balcony weakened terribly
a breeze blows on the gauze curtains behind him through which we see
silhouettes of madeleine and claudia
madeleine her arms outstretched now a vampire a long moan of pain coming from her
claudia comes through the curtains alarmed
louis speaks without turning
she is dying
it happened to you too but your childs mind cant remember
but if she dies
its only mortal death
he turns to look at claudia
bear me no ill will my love
we are now even
what do you mean
what died tonight inside that room was not that woman
it will take her many nights to die perhaps years
what has died in that room tonight is the last vestige in me of what was human
she takes his hand
we are een
he bends down and kisses her
he looks up at the wafting curtains
he sees silhouetted coming closer
looks up and screams
are ripped aside
the vampires of the theatre surge through
time for justice little one
the vampires close on them as louis struggles claudias scream pierces the night air
in a press of vampires louis claudia and madeleine are forced down the dark corridor
into vampire chaos as they are dragged through
louis struggling like a demon
get me armand
he wouldnt countenance this you can make no demands here
bastard santiago strikes louis to the ground
as he struggles to his feet he sees the vampires part around a figure coming through
he gasps at the sight of dressed beautifully but horribly scarred now from the fire as well as the earlier stabbing
lestat is confused ancient teetering reaching for santiagos shoulder to steady himself
is he the one
lestat shakes his head
no the child
the child was the one
all the murderers
you are alive lestat
it cant be murder
tell them how you treated us
lestat reaches out to louis
you come back to me louis
are you mad
the sentence is death
to all of them
only the girl it was the girl the sound of something being dragged through the crowd
horrible echoing scraping lestat grips santiago
you promised me i could take him back to new orleans louis theres something i must tell you about that night that night i met you he stares around him
the scraping gets louder
you let her go lestat you let her free and ill come back with you santiago grabs louis by the neck
death for the others
for you eternity in a box we see now what caused the scraping
a huge metal coffin being dragged through the vampires
walled in a dungeon
your only company will be your screams
perhaps it will take centuries
the vampires grab louis
they force him towards the coffin
lestat struggles with them
hes coming home with me you promised laughing we promised nothing
louis struggles fiercely as he is forced into the coffin
theyve fooled you lestat
you must reach armand
armand has the power
louis struggling in the coffin
then the lid is forced down huge locks closed over it
louis in the smallest imaginable space
beating his forehead against the metal
claudia throwing herself on the coffin crying
she is dragged away
vampire hands drag the coffin across the stone floor
louis forehead pouring with blood being thrown this way and that
the coffin is lifted upside down louis head crashes off the floor
is thrust into a niche in the wall
bricks being placed over mortar trowelled on
louis upside down
sounds of bricks and mortar
then terrifying unearthly scream pierces the coffin striking to his very soul
he loses consciousness
louis sleeps upside down
sound of bricks being broken thrown aside
then of locks breaking
louis opens his eyes
the lid opens
he sees above him reaching down to take his hand
dont make a sound
louis gets out into a vast long catacomb
louis runs to the end of it steps through a broken brick wall
where is she
follow me that way through my cell he points to his cell at the end of the passage the foot of the steps
sound of rain beyond the door
not without claudia
where is she
i cant save her
you cant believe id leave without her
you must save her
you have no choice
louis i cant save her
i will only risk losing you louis runs up the stone stairs
it leads to the ballroom
estelle stands far off looking at him coolly
she lifts the stage skull mask and laughs softly behind it
a male vampire slumps in a chair staring softly at louis
louis sees lestat sitting in a far corner
he rushes up to lestat who looks up at him confused
hes holding something crumpled made of cloth
youll come home with me louis
for a little while
until i am myself again
louis turns round and round in rage
passive still faces
a door bangs open and shut
louis looks again at lestat
he snatches the cloth from lestats hand
we see it is a small torn bloodstained dress
the door bangs again
rain gusts into the ballroom
louis goes to the door holding the dress
armand approaches trying to pull him away but louis shrugs him off
he draws nearer and nearer and stairs at on the stones lie claudia and madeleine burn to ashes in each others arms like the corpses of his wife and daughter
in the new orleans graveyard embracing each other
only claudias blond hair and madeleines red hair remain unburnt
louis looks up at the walls of this airwell many stories to the sky
he cries out in agony
santiago appears behind him staring
louis roars in horror and attacks santiago scattering the ashes into the rainy wind
claudias golden locks fly up into the wind they whirl around the warring figure
armand appears drags louis free pulls him screaming from the airwell into the ballroom towards the exit
claudias hair is sucked up by the wind through the airwell towards the night sky
louis is slumped against the stone wall
armand stands beside him like a guardian angel
i couldnt prevent it
i dont believe you
i do not have to read your soul to know that you lie
louis they cannot be brought back
there are some things that are impossible even for me
you let them do it
louis climbs to his feet
you held sway over them
they feared you
you wanted it to happen
louis i swear i did not
i understand you only too well
you let them do it as i let lestat turn a child into a demon
as i let her rip lestats heart to pieces
well i am no longer that passive fool that has spun evil from evil till the web traps the one who made it
your melancholy spirit of this century
i know what i must do
and i warn you you saved me tonight so i return the favor do not go near your cell in the theatre des vampires again
wet and deserted the streets around the theatre are quiet
chiming five a
looking at the paling sky
he is in an alleyway outside of armands cell
he has a huge keg with him
he finds the door unlocked
the hearth is cold
the old coffin is gone
louis silently closes the door to the passage and blocks it with an immense bar
he goes in the other door
louis hurls kerosene all over the stage the curtain the sets the seats below
he grabs the scythe from the playlet
he walks out
dribbling a trail of kerosene behind him
louis walking rapidly down leaving the trail of kerosene
he creeps quietly into the leaking kerosene from the cask
he splashes over the coffins that gleam in the dimness
then he strikes a match and heaves it into the kerosene
everything bursts into flame
the trail of kerosene roars into fire through the ballroom over the coffins and up the stairs
we hear explosions of fire from above
shudders all over fighting the morning weakness
he readies the scythe like the grim reaper
rises from her burning coffin screams and tries to run through the fire but louis slashes her down with the scythe and she goes down screaming her dress in flames
others rise choking in the smoke
screams from everywhere
they are burning
louis backs up the stairs to the he can see there a thin pale light under armands bolted door
suddenly comes at him from behind
santiago rushes him in a blur
louis swings the scythe too fast to see what he himself is doing
santiagos head streaming blood flies through the air
the body drops flapping its arms
screams come from everywhere
another vampire rushes burning towards louis
he decapitates him in turn
then he staggers into armands cell and bars the door the connects it to the ballroom behind him
he staggers to the outer door
there is a thin strip of daylight beneath the door blinding him
he throws it open and staggers into the daylight
louis staggers out of the burning theatre into the thin daylight
great gusts of smoke cover the street
he staggers through the daylight weakening about to fall when through the clouds of smoke comes as in a dream driven by armands human boy
the door of the hearse opens
through the curtains enclosing the interior we see armand
he reaches a hand out to louis and pulls him inside
the hearse vanishes through the smoke leaving the spectacle of the burning theatre
the gutted theatre and ballroom the roof collapsed exposed to the evening sky
the life of paris goes on around it oblivious
it is already a museum by this time and louis and armand fancily dressed and composed walk through it
they stop by a gericault the wreck of the medusa
you didnt even warm them did you
and yet you knew what i would do
i rescued you didnt i
from the terrible dawn
you were their leader
they trusted you
you made me see their failings louis
you made me look at them with your eyes
he looks at louis affectionately
your melancholy eyes
what a pair we are
we deserve each other dont we
we are a pair and thats what counts
armand and louis walk slowly through the louvre together
camera follows them for a while then comes to rest on a sunrise by turner
we left paris shortly after
for years we wandered
greece egypt all the ancient lands
then out of curiosity perhaps boredom who knows what i took him home to my america
a deco cinema of the twenties
louis and armand dressed in the style of the period walk down the aisle through the crowded seats
and there a technological wonder allowed me see sunrise for the first time in two hundred years
on the screen murnaus sunrise in black and white
we see a montage of sunrises from a whole range of movies in black and white
and what sunrises
seen as the human eye could never see them
we would sit in the dark night after night among nameless humans entranced with the miracle of light
silver at first then as the years progressed in tones of purple red and my long lost blue
the sunrises continue in color now and the backgrounds in them change to the fifties
and in time parted
we had become so alike we both wanted the certainties of loneliness once more
the lights come up in a different theatre
louis sitting there alone in a half empty theatre dressed in the clothes of the fifties
he rises exits with the others
cars rushing by twentieth century madness
louis emerges from the theatre walks through the streets
i had returned to new orleans
as soon as i smelt the air i knew i was home
there was sadness there rich almost sweet like the fragrance of jasmine
i walked the streets savoring it like a long lost perfume
louis walks past the many greek revival mansions
and then on prytania street only blocks from the lafayette cemetery i caught the scent of death and it wasnt coming from the graves
camera pans over white walled lafayette cemetery and its surrounding mansions
the scent grew stronger as i walked
a scent too faint for mortals to detect
louis sees rats darting across the street
they rush into a great overgrown garden surrounding a ruined mansion
louis stops at a rusted gate
he forces it open and enters of overgrown rose and oak tree and wisteria
he sees a faint glimmer of light coming from a distant glass window of a huge greek revival house
he approaches then he sees of a man long dead and dried up snagged in the thorny rosevines
sees another corpse almost nothing but bones sinking into the wet earth the roots of an oak overgrowing it
he looks up at the distant light
he passes a third corpse caught in wisteria and rose vine only bones and clothes
they were like the doomed princess caught in the thorny vines of sleeping beautys castle
i knew what it meant
a vampire had lured them here but had been to weak to get rid of them
louis sees dead rats lying near the steps
it spelt weakness madness the behavior of a dying animal that pollutes its own lair
louis treads carefully on the rotted steps
he moves along the porch
more dead rats
he sees through the floor length window into rooms lined with stacked books
virtually walled with them
water seeps down from the ceiling gleaming as it streaks over the books
the floors of the splendid rooms are bare except for a rotten french chair by a dead fireplace
a single mirror reflecting the moon
he moves along the porch to the parlor windows
the candle flickers inside
he sees lestat lying on the floor
he is gaunt to near starvation
all his scars are gone but he is almost a skeleton and his eyes are enormous in their sockets
his clothes are rags
blond hair beautiful as always
lestat escaped the fire
he hadnt even been there
and all those years i thought he was dead
one tiny candle stands beside him
he reads an early comic from the turn of the century
without turning his head he speaks
im so glad youre here louis
ive dreamed of your coming
dont try to speak
i didnt mean to let them do it
that santiago he tricked me
thats all past lestat
she should never have been one of us
he turns and looks at louis
old fearful broken
still beautiful louis
you always were the strong one
dont fear me lestat
i bring you no harm
youve come back to me louis
youve come again to me
louis shakes his head
a series of police sirens go by piercing the night sky
a helicopter goes overhead
red flashes illuminate his face
lestat shivers covers his ears
louis touches him calming him until the lights pass over
its only a siren
i cant bear it louis
the machines out there that fly and that roar
and such lights
they make the night brighter than the day
and they frighten you
you know i love the dark
but theres no dark anymore
its false light lestat
it cant harm you
if you stayed with me louis i could venture out
little by little
become the old lestat
he releases him
i have to go now lestat
you remember how i was louis
the vampire lestat
i tried to tell you louis
that night in paris
when i first came to you
no one can refuse the dark gift louis
not even you
and the more you tried the more i wanted you
a vampire with your beautiful suffering human heart
and how you suffered
i need your forgiveness louis
you have it
louis walks slowly away from him
lestat turns back to his candle his magazine
youll come back louis
take me out
little by little
and maybe ill be myself again
a bluebottle buzzes by him
his hand shoots out and grabs it squeezes the blood
whispering yes lestat
as he walks through the decayed house
his eyes are expressionless
and my story ends there
but in fact it ended a long time ago with claudias ashes in that theatre
my love died with her
i never really changed after that
what became of lestat i have no idea
i go on night after night
i feed on those who cross my path
but all my passion went with her yellow hair
i ma a spirit with preternatural flesh
malloy staring at louis
it cant end like that
but it has
there is no more to tell
but you talk about passion about longing about things ill never know in my life
its still inside you in every syllable you speak
and then you tell me it ends like that
its over im telling you
you need a new passion louis a new reason to feel
what a story youve told you dont understand yourself
louis looks at the cassettes on the table
do what you want with it
learn what you can
give the story to others
you have another chance louis
give me your gift your power
louis is slowly horrified then outraged and angry
is this what you want
you ask me for this after all ive told you
if i could see what youve seen feel what youve felt i wouldnt let it end like this
you need a like to the world out there a connection
then it wont end like this
he stares at louis
you need me
louis turns away
ive failed again havent i
dont say anymore
the reels are still turning
i have but one chance to show you the meaning of what ive said
he looks at the boy
then suddenly grabs him lifts him off the floor bares his terrifying fangs and brings them to his throat
malloy screams in involuntary terror
you like it
you like being food for the immortals
you like dying
is it beautiful
is it intense
malloy now terrified whispers no
louis drops him
malloy falls on the floor terrified
when he looks up louis has vanished
he looks up at the tape
it is still turning
he shakes his head
he gets up and with shaking fingers gathers his tapes
he runs out of the room
malloy running for his car a convertible
he leaps in and screeches off through the night
malloy whips the car through the tiny streets in sheer unfocused terror
malloy driving with streams of traffic over the bridge
he breathes deeply to calm himself
he takes a tape from his pocket and with still shaking hands sticks it in the deck
thats when it happened
i was twenty four
younger then you are now
suddenly a bony hand shoots out from the back seat pulls his neck backwards sinks his teeth in his neck
on the wheel shaking shuddering losing their grip
bulging as the life drains out of him
lestat sucking him like a rat
swinging free of malloys dying hands
veers wildly into oncoming traffic
coming towards them about to crush the car
grabs the wheel jerks it as he drinks
misses the truck by inches
throws malloy to one side climbs into the front seat
the tape is playing
tape my invitation was open to anyone
sailors whores thieves
but it was a vampire that accepted
at the wheel the corpse of malloy in the passenger seat
we can see the blood renewing him
will i ever forget
lestat drives on the car a tiny speck against the bridge the sea the sky beyond with the first fingers of light spreading through it
