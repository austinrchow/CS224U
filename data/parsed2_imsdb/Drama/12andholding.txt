written by anthony s cipriano
twin boys rudy and jacob carges ride their bikes through a suburban neighborhood
rudy the more athletic of the two rides at a breakneck pace
jacob rides slowly due to a hockey mask that he wears over his face
its making it difficult for him to see
the boys turn down a dirt path and ride deep into some woods
rudy and jacob ride to the edge of a clearing and stop
across from the clearing is a large oak tree which has a tree house perched high up in its branches
the boys cautiously look around and whisper
you see em
but that doesnt mean theyre not here
after a beat rudy gets off his bike and starts walking towards the tree house
jacob stays behind eyeing their safety
rudy contd contd jacob come on
suddenly a rock comes careening from off screen
it hits jacob in the head and knocks him to the ground
rudy darts for the oak tree as a hail storm of rock and debris come flying at him
as jacob rises a stream of blood pours down the front of his mask
he quickly runs for the tree
two boys jeff and kenny trailer park punks come running out of the woods rocks in hand
rudy and jacob climb the tree using makeshift rungs that are nailed into the trunk
in the floor of the tree house is a door
rudy removes a key from a chain around his neck and unlocks it
he climbs inside and pulls jacob in after him
jacob looks back and sees jeff and kenny running over
rudy crosses to the door with a bucket of liquid
what the hell is that
rudy dumps the piss onto jeff and kenny
now drenched with piss jeff and kenny jump from the tree screaming
they try to shake the urine off
kenny spits the taste out of his mouth and angrily calls up to the boys
you and your deformed brother are dead
jacob rips the hockey mask off
a large strawberry birthmark covers the right side of his face
calling to kenny anytime youre ready dickhead
jeff and kenny walk off
theyre fucking dead
jeff runs off screen and throws up
leonard fisher severely obese sits at the dinner table eating pancakes
his father patrick and two younger sisters haley and sara are seated with him
they are all overweight
leonards mother grace the largest of them all crosses to the table sits and starts eating
jump cuts show the progression of their meal
from globs of syrup being placed over pancakes to the mass consumption of omelets and sausage
caught up with eating nobody speaks
a modern upper class home with a large well tended yard
the check is supposed to be here on the first of the month
shes your daughter you asshole
yacco chuang asian american sexy uptight psychiatrist paces the hallway on the phone
her daughter malee with long black braided hair and thick rimmed glasses peeks her head out of the bathroom
mom i need help
ignoring her any parent is parent of the year next to you you selfish prick
yacco walks off
deflated malee reenters the bathroom
malee is wrapped in a towel and holding a tampon
confused she grabs the tampon box and reads the directions
malees confusion quickly turns to disgust
leonard sits upon a large rock with the words lindsay acres inscribed on the center of it
he eats popcorn
hanging off the top right hand corner of the rock is a banner which reads th annual th of july picnic
malee rides her bike up to leonard
she honks her bike horn at every pedestrian in her path
move it people
outta my way
she comes to a screeching halt an inch in front of leonard
mouthful youre late
yeah well i began menstruating this morning and i had some difficulty inserting the tampon
off his disgusted look what
its a natural process
you know i could conceive carry and birth a child right now
but i could
thats what matters
the twins said theyd meet us at the spot
leonard gets on his bike
nah im good
jacob wipes at his head wound frightened
maybe i should have mom look at it
if you didnt have that damn mask on youd have seen it coming
our birthday comes once a year and you ask for a hockey mask
you dont even play
jason from friday the th wears one
hes bad ass
jason wouldnt run home cause of a little blood
hed get back up decapitate his victim and move on
jacob looks out the makeshift window in the wall
you think jeff and kenny will come back
i dropped piss on their heads
id say the odds are pretty good
you did what
rudy and jacob turn to find malee and leonard entering the tree house
jeff and kenny were here
i dumped the piss ive been saving on their heads
why were you saving piss
pretty smart huh
no its stupid cause now theyre gonna come back here and kick all our asses
dont be such a pussy
yeah i could probably take them both myself
what are you gonna do leonard eat them
all im saying is who cares if they tear it down
this is our place
weve been coming here since we were seven
nothing lasts forever
youre such a butt munch
rudy pushes jacob
jacob pushes back
the two start fighting
you guys its your birthday
could you try and get along
off the boys fighting yacco sits across from debbie poole housewife conservatively dressed
i dont think therapy is helping
why do you say that
are you still cutting
embarrassed maggie lifts up her shirt sleeve
we see that her arm is covered with cuts
dried blood is everywhere
yacco is horrified by the sight
yacco contd oh debbie
it feels much better than it looks
suddenly malee bursts into her mothers office
malee quickly exits the office
excuse me for a moment
yacco enters the reception area
she is obviously angry
i told you a times to knock
i said i was sorry
why arent you with the boys
rudy and jacob went for pizza with their parents
yacco crosses to a desk and removes a flute from a drawer
i found this in the backseat of my car this morning
do you know how much flutes cost
go outside sit on the front steps and practice
angered malee grabs the flute and exits
malee drops on the stoop like a ton of bricks
after a beat she reluctantly begins playing her flute
a few pedestrians stop to listen
keep it moving
this aint a show
rudy and jacob stare into the camera with big grins
the boys relax their poses as ashley and jim carges s enter the shot
ashley puts her camera down on the table and picks up a large present
okay you got your small gifts this morning
now for the big ones
this one is rudys
rudy rips into the present revealing a sony play station
sony play station
oh my god
oh my god
since neither of you wanted a party this year we were able to splurge
ashley removes an envelope from her purse
she hands it to jacob
his enthusiasm suddenly turns to worry
what is it
only one way to find out
jacob removes a colorful pamphlet from the envelope
go ahead read it
isnt it about time
horrified i dont get it
your father and i are going to pay to have your birthmark removed
isnt that great
you got me surgery for my birthday
not just one
a series of them
its not cool
it totally sucks
jacob drops the envelope walks from the room
rudy enters the darkened room and crosses over to jacob who has his face planted in his pillow
jacob has been crying
dont sweat it
you can borrow my play station anytime you want
this isnt about the play station
its about this thing on my face
everybody hates it
who cares what you think
youre the reason for all of this
perfect you with your perfect skin
there to show the world what im supposed to look like
beat you know sometimes i just wish i wasnt your twin
know what i take it back you cant use my play station
rudy exits the room slamming the door after him
its your typical fourth of july block party
families crowd the streets with bbq grills cotton candy and beer
children ride their bicycles which are adorned with streamers balloons and noise makers
off to the side malee and jacob sit eating snow cones
jim carges tends to some burgers on his grill
gabe artunion real estate agent approaches
i already told you gabe im not selling that land
not acres not five
im willing to pay top dollar
im not gonna let you tear down those woods so you can stack twenty houses right on top of each other
im gonna write down a number
hell your kids play in those woods all the time
you cant put a price on that
gabe writes down a number and hands it to jim
i believe i can
jim looks at the figure and his eyes go wide
a line of picnic tables surround nearby grills
leonards family minus leonard sit eating as if theres no tomorrow
look at them
on two soccer moms watching leonards family eat
soccer mom contd you know grace can barely walk because of her weight
where do you think she finds clothes big enough to fit
the two woman walk off
as they disperse we see leonard standing behind them
he has heard every word
hurt leonard looks down at his own plate which overflows with food
he feels embarrassed and disgusted
patrick rises and crosses over to the buffet table
good eating huh son
patrick grabs the ladle and begins to fill up his plate
maybe you shouldnt have seconds dad you know
who are you richard simmons
cmon enjoy the day
he walks off with his food
leanard looks down at the food shrugs then helps himself to a heaping porion
rudy straddles his bike while watching a group of year olds having a water balloon fight
jealous he reminiscences to a time when he was one of those kids
me and jeff are gonna pay that tree house of yours a little visit tonight
rudy spins around to find kenny standing at his side
kenny contd when were through itll be a pile of scrap
why dont you take your smelly ass back to the trailer park
free country asshole
you got nothing better to do than pick on us all the time
i did until yesterday
i thought you liked golden showers
oh no that was your mother
kenny pushes rudy to the ground and then jumps on top of him
rudy struggles to get free but hes overpowered
a crowd of kids surround them chanting fight fight
jeff hocks a phlegm wad onto rudys face
rudy screams as the stream of saliva drips across his nose and onto his lip
whats going on over there
kenny looks up and sees a neighborhood parent coming over
ill finish this tonight
kenny pushes rudy down once more and runs off
rudy slowly rises wiping the saliva from his face
the entire neighborhood has descended upon a vacant lot
they are awaiting the annual fireworks display
we find leonard jacob and malee sitting on a large rock which gives them a birds eye view of the crowd
rudy runs over to the rock and climbs up top
kenny showed up
he said jeff and him are gonna tear the treehouse down tonight
we gotta sneak out and stop them
mom and dad would kill us
we cant let him tear it down
its just a treehouse
no its not
you know what you suck
leonard you in
you dont have to go if you dont want to
dont listen to him
hes a pussy
leonard looks between jacob and malee
finally someone with balls
insulted jacob slides off the rock and walks away
rudy contd contd let them go
the fireworks display begins
as they turn to watch it
we scan the room and come to a set of bunk beds
a body in the top bunk sits up and turns on a small bed light
reveal its rudy
rudy grabs his watch from the post and silences the alarm
jacob sits up in bed
unless youre coming with me i dont want to hear it
jacob lies back in bed silent
rudy jumps off the top bunk gets dressed and grabs a baseball bat
before leaving rudy looks back at jacob and shakes his head disappointed
rudy contd you know you cant be a pussy all your life
jeff and kenny pick on you all the time and you dont do shit
its my problem
no its mine too
cause were brothers
thats what brothers do
they fight for each other kill for each other die for each other
i dont feel that way
cause youre a pussy
so stay home keep your head under the blankets
im gonna fight
with that rudy disappears out the window
sfx creaking door
a flashlight illuminates the location
leonard and rudy enter with the help of a flashlight
leonard reaches inside his backpack and removes a number of snack cakes from his backpack
re snack cakes some provisions
were only gonna be here a couple of hours
when two oclock rolls around youll be begging for one of these
rudy shakes his head removes his bat from his backpack
leonard contd re baseball bat i didnt bring my glove
moron the bat is for jeff and kenny
you know to scare them a little
he swings it hard
rudy contd maybe its best if we dont talk
listen for them and dont fall asleep
im wide awake
i could stay up all night
the treehouse is illuminated by the full moon which rests in the sky above
the thunderous sound of a million crickets fills the air
both boys lie asleep
a mosquito flies in through the window and buzzes past leonards ear
he haphazardly swipes at it in his sleep wakes himself up
rudy jumps awake
what is it
leonard rises picks up his bag and opens the trap door in the floor
he is about to exit
where you going
theyre not gonna show up im goin home
its three oclock suddenly a flaming cocktail comes flying through the window
it hits rudy in the head explodes and engulfs him in flames
jeff and kenny stand a few yards away from the treehouse
both laugh at the sight of the flames inside
and aim for the window
jeff lights his cocktail
it misses the window and smashes into the side of the tree house
kenny contd contd ha ha you suck
jeff and kenny hear leonard and rudy screaming from inside
you hear that
rudy now covered in flames rolls on the floor screaming
put it out
put it out
leonard struggles to put out the flames with his backpack but its of no use
he spins around and finds the wall behind him engulfed with flames
he screams terrified
jeff and kenny are frantic
theyre in there
theyre in there
jeff turns around and runs back home through the woods
leonard backs away from rudy
unfortunately he doesnt realize that the door in the floor is open
we watch over kennys shoulder as leonard falls from the treehouse smacks his head on the tree trunk and comes to a crash upon some rocks
kenny runs over and finds leonard unconscious
wake up kid
off the treehouse which is now a towering inferno ashley jumps up from a deep sleep
there is terror on her face
she rushes over to her desk and turns on the lamp
ken is awakened by her
what is it
i forgot to deposit your paycheck last week
but i already wrote some checks
with the cookout and everything i forgot
ill deposit it tomorrow
the holiday should buy us an extra day
write yourself a note so you dont forget again
i just did
ashley turns off the desk lamp and returns to bed
ashley contd goodnite
on jim and ashley watching rudys casket as it is lowered into the ground
the once spirited couple now looks tired and pained
they are accompanied by a number of mourners
rest in piece rudolph eugene carges
may god hold you in the palm of his hand
jacob stands beside his parents
tears stream from his eyes across his birthmark and off his chin
so stricken with grief jacob barely has to energy to wipe the tears away
we continue on through the crowd and find malee
embarrassed by the tears she brings a black veil down over her face
malee enters still wearing the veil
she crosses to the couch and sits beside a patient gus maitland long haired hippi type with a moustache and beard
gus eyes malee intrigued
friend or family
the person who died
youll like dr
this is only my second session but shes good
im not a patient
im her daughter
malee lifts her veil and looks at gus
i can see the resemblance
are you trying to make me sick
gus shoots malee a look just as yacco exits her office
gus rises and enters the office
yacco contd contd ill be with you in a second
yacco crosses to malee and sits beside her
yacco contd contd so how was it
it was a funeral mom
how do you think it was
im sorry i couldnt make it
let rudys parents know im available if they need to talk
i wont charge for the sessions
malee looks to yacco stunned by her comment
yacco contd contd you know its okay to cry
i know its okay to cry
i dont need you to tell me its okay to cry
if i want to cry ill cry
yacco re enters her office
malee starts to cry
cars fill the driveway and line the street in front of jacobs house
mourners stand in small groups engaged in hushed conversations
jim sits in his recliner crying
a number of mothers watch as ashley obsessively prepares a platter of deviled eggs
concerned one of them crosses over to her
ashley theres more than enough food here
no rudy loved my deviled eggs
its right that i make them
wheres the paprika
ashley opens up her cupboards in search of the paprika
ashley contd contd jesus you put something down and it disappears
now angry ashley starts throwing objects out of the cupboards haphazardly
ashley slams her cupboard doors shut
she looks around and spots the garbage pail across the kitchen
maybe i threw it out
ashley crosses to the garbage
she lifts it upside down and dumps the trash all over the floor
ashley gets on her knees and starts searching
the other women look to each other uncomfortable
mother kneels down beside her
ashley ignores her
mother grabs ashleys hands and looks her in the eye
ashley stops cold
the grief and heartache hit once again
ashley contd contd not my baby
please god not my son
the mothers collectively drop to the floor and surround ashley in an attempt to comfort her
they give no care to the pile of garbage they now sit in
leonard lies in a bed staring out the window
there is a bandage wrapped around his forehead
patrick sits beside him in a chair
grace enters carrying bags of mcdonalds food with her
this hospital is a nightmare
the elevator is never there when you need it
patrick crosses over to the food and grabs his lunch
where are the girls
haley took sara up to the maternity ward
grace crosses over to leonard
grace contd contd how are you feeling
my head hurts
youre lucky you didnt get killed
i told you im sorry
you try being awakened at four oclock in the morning by the police saying they have your son hes unconscious and on his way to the hospital
ive never been so scared in my life
and poor rudy
leonard starts crying
grace contd what
my best friend is dead
grace hands leonard a double cheeseburger
itll make you feel better
im not hungry
besides i cant taste anything anyway
hospital food is always bland
this has flavor
no its because of my condition
i cant taste or smell anything anymore
what are you saying condition
shrugs my condition
patrick and grace sit across from the doctor s
leonard has a condition
its called anosmia
oh my god
is it serious
anosmia is when a person looses their sense of smell
its not uncommon in patients who suffer serious head injuries
unfortunately its also affecting his ability to taste
again not uncommon
is it permanent
depends on the patient
what do we do
he cant eat
he can eat
he just cant taste what hes eating
what she means is he wont eat
leonards association with food is no longer about taste
its about texture
while we may be partial to sweet or salty foods leonard will become partial to crunchy or smooth ones
once he settles on a texture he likes his appetite will increase
i cant believe this is happening
considering what leonard could have suffered hes lucky
besides he is severely overweight
a loss of appetite may be a benefit
grace and patrick shoot him a look of death
leonard lies in bed staring out the window
a nurse enters and crosses over to his bedside table
howd we do
the nurse sees that leonard has barely touched his food
nurse contd contd you have to eat something
it may not be gourmet but you dont look that finicky
this stuff feels like shit in my mouth
its macaroni and cheese
it feels gross
like theres a film on my tongue
the nurse grabs the tray of food
she removes an untouched apple and places it in leonards hand
leonard contd contd i dont like apples
so you cant taste it right
maybe youll like the crunch
the nurse exits
leonard eyes the apple in his hand
he reluctantly takes a bite
the apple makes a loud crunch
leonard starts chewing
after a few seconds a smile comes to his face
he likes it
jacob lies in bed holding rudys old baseball glove
he brings the glove to his nose and a flood of old memories come back to him
jacob rises crosses over to the closet and removes a metal lock box
he selects for the combination and the box opens
jacob removes the contents baseball cards some firecrackers a few ticket stubs and a photograph of he and rudy at age
he cant help but smile
gabe artunian crosses over to jim
im leaving jim
again so sorry
as gabe turns to leave
gabe are you still interested in buying the land
because i accept your offer
this is hardly the time to talk business
buy the woods gabe please
tear them down and build
build houses condos a i dont care
i just dont want to recognize it ever again
off gabes look tight on a chain saw chopping down a tree
widen to reveal a construction crew tearing down the last of the woods
rows and rows of stumps make it look like a graveyard for trees
its all gone
we find malee and jacob straddling their bikes a few feet away from the site
leonard is beside them on a scooter
he as a band aid on his forehead
malee contd contd if rudy was alive hed be freaking out right now
leonard shoots malee a look
she silences herself
you holding up alright jacob
leonard contd contd im sorry
i wish i could have done something
jeff and kenny were the ones that started the fire
it was their fault
or maybe mine
i should of been there
you wouldnt have been able to do anything
and it could have been you who died
i wish it was
you know the last thing rudy said to me
he said i cant be a pussy all my life
he was right i am
and rudy might be dead because of it
dont say that
beat why dont you talk to your parents about this
they cant help me
give them time
itll get better
what if it doesnt
my dad hasnt gone back to work yet
what if he loses his job
we could lose our house
i could be homeless
then youll stay with me
were best friends
suddenly something catches malees attention off screen
its gus standing beside a bulldozer
oh my god
i like know him
hes one of my mothers patients
ive never seen a patient of hers actually out and about
beat should we go over and say hi
i just want to get out of here
leonard and jacob start heading off
malee stays for a beat eyeing gus as he removes his t shirt and exposes his rock abs
she is obviously turned on
you coming malee
leonard enters to find grace placing a casserole dish on the table
the table is filled with a cornucopia of food
are we having company
no this is all for you
your favorites fried chicken spaghetti pizza french fries and chocolate cheesecake for dessert
i made everything extra spicy so you can taste it
ma it doesnt matter how spicy the food is
so youre not even gonna try it
im sure its delicious
grace puts the plate of food into the sink
grace contd you cant just eat apples all the time
beat searching its unhealthy
off leonards confusion students make their way inside for the first day of school
there is a sign out front which reads welcome back
a teacher walks along the line of desks showing students their assigned seats
tommy takes his seat
teacher contd contd jacob carges
jacob takes his seat
teacher contd contd rudy carges
jacob along with his classmates are shocked to discover that rudys name hasnt been removed from the attendance sheet
the teacher is unaware of the mistake
teacher contd contd rudy carges
tommy looks to jacob
since rudys not saying anything he will
hes not in this class anymore
how do you know
cause hes dead
i realize being new at this school puts me at a disadvantage but joking about a fellow classmates death is anything but funny mr
the teacher checks her attendance sheet
teacher contd carges
wait are you
im his brother
and im not joking
the teacher looks around at the other students realizing jacob is telling the truth
im so sorry
wow this is awkward
would you like the seat left empty
off jacobs look
coach gilmore overweight gym teacher dressed in a jogging suit snaps gum while addressing his students
the class of boys stand up against the wall
leonard is amongst them
his gym uniform barely fits
alright ladies welcome to gym
we will be starting things off this year with the united states standardized fitness test
the entire class groans
coach contd contd im sure you all remember it from last year
i will be testing you in a number of physical fitness areas
as coach speaks leonard looks as if hes going to throw up
a student performs chin ups with great ease
the states requirement for upper body strength is ten chin ups
the student finishes his run with a count of twelve
he hops off the bar and crosses over to his classmates
coach contd contd leonard youre up
leonard crosses to the chin up bar grabs a hold of it and begins struggling to lift himself up
unfortunately he can only manage th of an inch
leonard drops off the bar exhausted
coach contd contd what are you doing lets go
that was as far as i could pull myself up
a few students laugh
coach shakes his head disgusted
coach stands over the boy timing him with a stop watch
you need forty to pass
the student increases his speed
coach contd contd time
the student rises off the mat and walks over to the other boys
leonard enters frame and drops on the mat like a ton of bricks
coach contd contd rolling his eyes go
leonard struggles to lift himself up but he cant do it
coach contd contd come on son fight it
leonards face turns red
he clenches his teeth
unfortunately due to the pressure he is exerting he blows a loud fart
the gym erupts with laughter
the coach and his students stand at the beginning of the track waiting for leonard to finish his laps
leonard slowly walks over
he is soaking wet and breathing heavy
the goal was
the class cant help but laugh
coach contd contd hit the showers
the class walks off
coach contd not you leonard
leonard turns back and crosses over to the coach
coach contd contd center
thats the position youll be playing in two years
you dont like football
i love it
its just ill never make the weight requirement
pop warner league wouldnt let me play for five years because of it
theres no weight requirement in high school ball son
the coach bends down and rifles through his gym bag
he removes books and hands them to leonard
coach contd contd these are your new bibles
one is on nutrition the other exercise
you do what they say and you can play for me once you get to high school
leonard begins walking back to the gym
after a few steps he stops and turns back
leonard contd contd coach why are you doing this for me
because ive never seen a child so out of shape in my life
the school band is on stage and playing a particularly horrendous rendition of the star spangled banner
we find malee in the flute section playing her heart out
the conductor mr
farmer overly energetic and dorky waves his baton silencing the band
annoyed did anyone practice over the summer
the band sits silent
well we still have a fall recital coming up
if anyone would like to perform a solo sign up on the sheet outside my office
off malee weighing the decision in her mind
malee stands outside mr
farmers office staring at the sign up sheet on his door
after a beat she lifts her pen to sign her name
before she writes it she stops quickly turns around and walks away
after a beat malee returns to the sign up sheet and starts writing her name
halfway through she stops scratches out her name and walks off
we remain on the sign up sheet
after a few seconds malees hand enters the shot and writes in her name
jacob enters to find jim and ashley fighting
no theyre wrong
call them back
ashley i talked to the lawyer
he wouldnt lie
whats going on
this is all your fault
if we had gone to the hearings like i said this wouldnt be happening
we agreed it would be too painful
mom what happened
ashley turns to jacob as if realizing his presence for the first time
tell your son
the boys who killed rudy cut a deal
they got a year in juvinile hall and five years probation
thats what your brothers life is worth
a damn year
ashley calm down
how can you be so unaffected by this
our son was murdered
measured it was an accident and the boys are juveniles
so that makes it okay
ashley storms out of the room
jacob looks to his father unnerved by the sight of his mother so upset
jim just turns and walks into the living room
leonard awakens and silences the alarm
he sits up in bed for a moment and comes to his senses
dressed in a sweat suit and sneakers leonard sprints down the driveway and to the street
his sweat suit is so tight leonard looks like a stuffed sausage
with each step he takes leonard breathing becomes heavier and heavier
sweat forms on his forehead and drips down his face
within seconds leonards pace tapers off
he struggles to continue but is so out of shape stopping is inevitable
leonard leans over gasping for air
he looks back and realizes that he only ran about one hundred yards
in fact his house is still in view
leonard turns around and starts walking back home
after a few steps he stops and throws up
gus stands inside of a shallow ditch digging out the roots of an old tree
dont i know you
gus turns and sees malee behind him holding a picnic basket
we were never introduced
my name is malee
they shake hands
gus contd contd what are you doing here
i was in the mood for a picnic
i thought this would be a nice place to have one
gus looks around confused
this location is anything but picnic friendly
bulldozers plough through the scene blasting exhaust into the air
men scream at each other
asshole move your fucking truck
would you like to join me
theres plenty of food
i dont go to lunch for another ten minutes
meet me by the cement mixer when youre ready
malee walks off
gus watches as she makes her way through the construction site
gus and malee sit on a checkered blanket eating chinese food with chopsticks
a large cement mixer stands behind them
the last time i saw you you had just come from a funeral
how are you doing
death is like so weird
i mean its sad but i also feel like ive been given this sign
a sign which is telling me life is short so you gotta do what makes you happy
you gotta take chances
you gotta get crazy
what are you doing to get crazy
i play the flute
laughs yeah thats totally nuts
no not that
see every year my school has this recital
ive always been too scared to play a solo in front of people but this year ive decided to do it
good for you
when is it
why do you care
cause im gonna go
you cant go
nobody goes to these things
i dont even think my mom is going
you gotta have somebody rooting for ya
besides i like music and i owe you for bringing me lunch
laughs embarrassed okay
tuesday at in the junior high school auditorium
ill be there
vulnerable dont say it if you dont mean it
ill be there
shes got a major crush on gus now
tight on tv video game halo
two soldiers fire at each other with supersonic weapons
one soldier is particularly annihilated
game over appears
reveal jacob and leonard in front of the tv
malee off to the side reading a book
i cant believe how much you suck at this game
jacob throws his remote down
leonard contd contd you wanna play again
the boys sit in silence for a beat
you wanna shoot some hoops
beat the sentencing thing totally upset my mom
she was up half the night crying
malee closes her book looks over at leanord
i cant believe it either
a year aint shit
rudy is dead forever
i want them dead
i want to kill them
i could handle a year in juvy hall
whoa what those guys did was an accident
if you were to kill them its premedicated
youd get years to life at least
so im just supposed to sit here and take it
be like you guys
what is that supposed to mean
you seem to have gone on with life pretty easily
dont you miss him
dont you care
its not that we dont care
life goes on
you have to deal with it
if you dont it could like eat you alive forever
percent of peoples problems is due to their inability to get over the past
how do you know
my mom tells that to all her patients
ive eavesdropped on some of her therapy sessions
can i listen in sometime
anyway she says if a person wants closure they gotta deal with their problems head on
go see these guys and let them know how you feel
i dont think my parents would be up for that
juvy hall is only like forty minutes from here
take the bus
off jacob thinking the bedroom door slowly opens
jacob peeks his head inside the darkened room and quietly enters
he tip toes over to his parents bed
ashley lies asleep wrapped up in a bundle of blankets
jacob crosses to her night stand and opens the top drawer
he removes her purse unzips it and steals some cash which totals around dollars
jim sits in his chair staring off into space
jacob enters and crosses to the front door
with the help of the bus driver jacob loads his bike into the luggage compartment underneath the bus
then he hands the driver a ticket and boards
jacob takes a seat up front
after a few moments the driver boards starts the engine and drives off
jacob and kenny sit staring at each other through a plate of glass
kenny picks up the one way phone
jacob does also
i think he
interrupting i hate you
you know that
rudy knew we were going to be there
he never should have come
you want the truth all this happened cause of you
yeah you deformed retard
the only reason we started picking on you guys in the first place was because of that thing on your face
every night i lie in bed and plan your murder
first im going to take a kitchen knife and chop off your fingers then your nose then your tongue
then im gonna poke out your eyes with the end of a broomstick
well not really poke them out but im gonna push them back into your brain
then im gonna take scissors and cut off your ears
when they find you its gonna be like putting a jigsaw puzzle back together
if you kill me you come here
what do i have to look forward to
youve already destroyed my life
what happened was an accident
there are no accidents
youre gonna pay for what you did
and its gonna hurt like hell
leonard sits reading through nutritional manuals
we see that he is writing things down on a piece of paper
the words written are sugar corn syrup salt gum
grace walks through the hallway half asleep
she enters the kitchen and finds leonard sitting on the floor surrounded by boxes of food
all of the kitchen cupboards are open and packages line the counter tops
what the hell is this
im reading the list of ingredients in our foods
do you know the damage these chemicals can do to the human body
leonard put everything back
this is serious
you cant keep buying this crap
dont you care that youre ingesting garbage
just put everything back and go to sleep
off leonards look malee is riding her bike on the sidewalk when she sees gus exit his car and enter her mothers office
malee runs up a flight of stairs
she gets off at the second floor and enters an open unoccupied office
malee runs over to the heating grate and puts her ear to it
how was your week
still cant sleep
when i do nightmares
yacco and gus sit across from each other
post traumatic stress is very common in your line of work
many fire fighters go through this
but why now
i havent fought fires in ten years
sometimes we experience something so horrific our memory blocks it out
that way we wont have to relive the pain
its called repression
our bodies are not so forgiving however
inside we feel the effects of trauma even when we dont know why
what does that mean
something stirred your unconscious
if we find out what that was we can begin the healing process
gus looks to her confused
yacco contd contd you told me last week the nightmares started about the time you moved here
lets look at that
why did you move here
a friend was making good money with construction
he got an offer to build that extension off lindsay acres
he suggested i come into town and work for a while
malee is on the edge of her seat listening
we see that she has written the following words in her notebook gus are there any other reoccurring elements in your dreams
perhaps a face or
light my fire is always playing
light my fire
the doors song
singing da da something
wallow in the mire
we couldnt get much higher
come on baby light my fire
yacco stares at gus
he is suddenly self conscious
malee circles the words light my fire again and again and again
sfx clanging pots and pans coming from downstairs
jacob exits his room and goes to inspect the noise
jim stands on a chair cleaning out the kitchen cupboards
pots and pans line the counter tops dishes cover the table and non perishable foods are spread out across the floor
jacob enters and is taken aback by the sight of jim standing on a chair and wearing an apron and rubber gloves
jim rips the rubber gloves off with his teeth
jim contd contd you know for the past few weeks i sat in this house
i couldnt move
everything reminded me of rudy
then from out of nowhere i had a revelation
i am alive
your mother is alive
i became overcome with joy because i realized how lucky we are to still have you
i love you
jim grabs jacob and hugs him tightly
jacob pulls away unsettled and bit frightened
jim contd contd half crazed i went to work today
for the first time in weeks
it was as if i had just gotten out of college
i was fearless
i went after accounts i had avoided for years because i thought they were out of my league
i spoke to presidents vice presidents business managers sales reps
i was amazing
i was magic
but when i came home to share the news with your mother i discovered her asleep
when i looked around the house i realized that her office for lack of a better word was also piled up
so i took to the house
i have made it my duty to clean this place from top to bottom
even if it takes me all night i dont care
will you join me
join me in this celebration of life
a symbolic gesture of cleaning out the old and bringing in the new
do i have to
thrown for a loop no you dont have to
good night dad
off jims look parents and students file inside
a large sign above the door reads jefferson junior high fall recital
a packed audience listens to a girl standing center stage and singing the rose
she is not nearly as good as she thinks she is but she sings full throttle
we find malee sitting in the flute section and playing along with the rest of the orchestra
she looks to the front row but gus is no where to be found
the girl finishes her song and the crowd politely applauds
farmer crosses to the microphone
im sure bette midler would be most impressed with that rendition
the crowd laughs
farmer didnt mean for it to be a joke
farmer contd contd anyway our next soloist is malee chung
she will play the theme from love story on the flute
the crowd applauds as malee rises and crosses to the microphone
thank you mr
malee spots gus walking down the aisle
he scurries into the front row and sits
malee lights up
malee contd contd theres actually been a change
im not going to play the theme from love story
this is a song
farmer waves to malee from off stage
malee looks at him
farmer mouths something to her
i cant hear you
farmer throws up his hands
malee contd contd anyway
this is a song by the doors
at the mention of the doors gus smile instantly fades
the coincidence is just too great
malee starts to play light my fire
she is good
farmer and the audience seem pleased by her euphonious performance
even gus is won over
he appears entranced by the music
the recital is over
most of the audience has filed out
a few remain offering their congratulations to the musicians
malee stands with leonard
couldnt make it
malee spots gus heading towards her
oh my god
hes coming over
malee pushes leonard behind her just as gus approaches
you were awesome
id rather you tell me i sucked then lie
you were great
leonard peeks around malees back
excuse me for a second
malee turns around and pinches leonard
ow ow ow alright
leonard walks off
malee turns back around with a big smile on her face
she plays coy
so you really enjoyed it
what made you pick it
covering oh uh
my mother was humming it all last week
big doors fan
is she here
she missed out
youre so sweet
yeah well i have to go but thanks again
i had a great time
gus gives malee an innocent kiss on the check and then walks off
she stands frozen clutching onto her flute in ecstacy
with fire and determination leonard jogs
unfortunately he is quickly winded by the run
he bends over gasping
superimpose shot over shot leonard appears running past his old weaker self
stronger he makes a few more yards and then is forced to stop
he leans over for air and we superimpose another shot over shot of leonard weeks later running past his weaker self
this series of shots repeats a few more times illustrating the progression of time and weight loss
leonard runs up and down the stairs sweating like crazy
grace appears watching him around the corner
she shakes her head and then returns to the kitchen
that boy is going to bring the entire house down
let him be
hes looking good
im proud of him
to the girls girls have you decided what youre going to go as for halloween
either a witch or a princess
im going to go as a marble
what do you mean a marble
you know like a bag of marbles but just one marble
jacob and jeff sit across from each other on the phone
jeff has two black eyes and a fat lip
he is crying profusely
jacob doesnt appear at all sympathetic
im really sorry man
you just think about what i said
get out of my sight
and send kenny in on your way out
jeff rises and walks to a door leading to the jail
a moment later kenny enters looking pissed off
he sits across from jacob and picks up the phone
what did you say to him
i thought youd both like to know that halloween was rudys favorite holiday
jacob picks up some pictures and presses them against the glass
jacob contd contd these are pictures from every single halloween since we were five
you see how happy he was
after wed go trick or treating wed sit in our room and swap the candy we hated
rudy loved snickers i almond joys
almond joy sucks
what sucks is that ill never get to sit in my room and swap candy with my brother ever again
thanks to you
why are you doing this
to remind you
how could we forget
you been coming here for months to remind us
no one is forcing you to talk to me
anything to get out of my cell
is your cell small
so is a coffin
youre not the only one who wishes he was still alive
id do anything to bring him back but i cant
its not easy being in here
hell you saw jeff
what happened to him
he pissed off the wrong guy off
jeff is totally fucked right now
dont come back here ever again
ill come if i want
dont expect me to show up
kenny slams down the phone and exits
jacob smiles having shaken him
grace hands out candy to a few trick or treaters at her door
be careful now
have a good night
grace crosses to the kitchen table where pat is doing a crossword puzzle
kids keep coming later every year
sfx front door opening and closing
haley and sara storm into the kitchen in tears
haley is dressed as a marble and sara is dressed as a witch
i hate him
i hate him
he threw away all our halloween candy
he grabbed our bags and just threw them down a gutter
haley and sara run out of the kitchen
what the hell is going on
why did you throw away their candy
because their sugar intake is completely unhealthy
besides halloween is supposed to be a celebration of evil
how did candy get wrapped into it
i am going to ask you this once and i want a straight answer
are you in a cult
this is what happens when kids join cults
the first thing they change is their diets
im not in a cult
this is all information you can find in books
the issue here is that you have stolen one of the most exciting nights of the year from your sisters
if anybody had done this to you when you were a child we never would have heard the end of it
i wish somebody had done it to me
i wish either one of you had given a shit about my weight
leonard storms out of the kitchen
patrick and grace are speechless
leonard lies on the floor doing sit ups
he can actually do a few now
patrick bursts into the room
i do not care for your language
im only trying to help you guys
leonard stops exercising
leonard contd youre fat dad
mom is fat
us kids are fat
whats your point
dad you and mom are going to die young if you keep eating as poorly as you do
what is this obsession you have with weight
the coach for jefferson high is also my gym teacher
he told me that if i got into shape i could start as center for the freshman team when i get to high school
center is a great position
toughest guy on the field
a good center can make or break a team
thats why im trying so hard to get into shape
you guys should to
at the rate youre going you wont make it to your s
your mom to her a tasty meal is just a way of showing she cares
tonight she served spaghetti and meatballs from a can
the amount of sodium alone can wreck havoc on a persons blood pressure
not to mention
leonard people just dont drop dead from eating meatballs
off leonards look malee hands gus her bag of halloween candy
i cant take your halloween candy
youll be doing me a favor
chocolate gives you zits
besides if i want to keep this firm ass as an adult i gotta develop good eating habits now
uncomfortable maybe just a snickers
gus opens a snickers bar and starts eating
so work is good
to be honest i cant wait till this job is finished
this place is creepy
you know a boy died here like right before we started working
his name was rudy
you knew him
he was one of my best friends
remember that funeral i went to
that was him
i thought you knew
two boys threw a flaming cocktail at him
can you imagine killing someone like that
how evil can you get
gus eyes malee completely unsettled
obviously drunk gus stumbles to his front door
he fumbles for his keys and enters
gus lies in bed with a bottle of whiskey in one hand and a gun in the other
distraught and at the point of tears gus opens the chamber and loads the gun with a single bullet
then he spins the chamber and locks it
gus puts the gun to his head and fires
he throws the gun across the room grabs the bottle of whiskey and drinks it till its gone
ashley stands with a big smile on her face
jeff laskey is dead
jim and jacob look up stunned
he committed suicide in his jail cell last night
sally yngve called just now to tell me
jim and jacob sit stunned
their shock turns to intrigue as ashley appearing unaffected by the news crosses to the kitchen table opens a nearby box of donuts and begins eating
she is smiling
why are you smiling
a boy died
no a monster that murdered my son died
justice is served end of story
ashley crosses to the kitchen sink
she rolls up her sleeves and begins cleaning
jim crosses over to her and they kiss as if nothing happened
jacob is baffled by their behavior
jacob and kenny are on the phone together
kenny looks gaunt and tired
jeffs death has obviously affected him
he used his bed sheet waited until lights out and then jumped
his cell mate let him hang there the entire night
im sorry kenny
like you even give a shit
i bet when you heard you started dancing
i knew he wouldnt make it
its my fault too
jeff wasnt a saint when i met him but he sure as hell wasnt headed here
tearing up that fucking asshole
kenny drops the phone and begins crying in his arms
jacob watches through the glass touched by kennys reaction
jacob sits on the floor surrounded by boxes and wrapping paper
santa has obviously been good to him
jim sits on the couch drifting in and out of sleep
ashley dressed in her finest christmas sweater peruses the fireplace mantel and all of the decorations that line it
she is a drastically different woman than the last time we saw her
she looks upbeat and pretty
ashley looks at jacob and smiles
he has just unwrapped an
you like it
i love it
you guys went crazy this year
ashley smiles at her son
its a bittersweet moment for her
im going to shower
jim jacob still has one more present
i thought we were going to wait
no do it now
ashley crosses to the couch and sits beside jim
they hold each others hands
after serious debate your father and i have decided
to adopt a what
were gonna adopt a baby
hopefully a boy
off jacobs shock leonards extended family sits at the kitchen table eating christmas dinner
his extended family is just as overweight as his immediate
leonard barely touches his own plate too disgusted to eat
may i be excused
the entire family stops eating and turns to him
leonard sits back down
his family quickly resumes eating
malee does her homework yacoo flips through a fashion magazine
why do i have to do this
its christmas break
youll be one step ahead in january
just because youre an atheist i dont get to celebrate the holidays
yacco shoots malee the look of death
malee contd contd dont you find it hard not believing in anything
im going for a bike ride
theres a foot of snow outside
the streets are ploughed
besides i like looking at all the lights
be home in an hour
malee flips through a telephone book
she comes to gus name and rips out the page
malee knocks on gus door but he doesnt answer
then malee spots a welcome mat
she kicks it aside and discovers a spare key underneath
malee cautiously enters shutting the door behind her
she allows the excitement to settle in
its your typical bachelor pad
stray beer bottles decorate every shelf and end table
dirty clothes drape across an old couch
malee continues on to the kitchen
malee finds the kitchen more of a mess than the living room
pots pans and stacks of tv dinners line the counter top
malee enters and stops cold at the sight of the bed
its unmade and the sheets and blankets are entangled in a ball
aroused malee sits on the bed and then lies back in ecstacy
gus drives up parks along the sidewalk and gets out
malee goes through a photo album
we see pictures of gus dressed in a firefighters uniform
he appears much younger and clean cut
as malee returns the album to the night stand she notices a an open drawer and peeks inside
gus lazily makes his way upstairs
malee holds gus gun
complete with sound effects she pretends to shoot a beer bottle off the dresser
malee laughs and then jumps across the bed like a charlies angel
gus fumbles for his keys
malee stands in front of the mirror posing
malee laughs in spite of herself
in the process she unknowingly cocks the trigger
malee places the gun to her forehead and pretends to shoot herself
tight on trigger a hair away from firing the loud bang we heard was the front door slamming shut
gus opens it and inspects the door frame
gus removes a beer from the fridge
we follow him into his bedroom
he stops cold as if feeling the presence of some one else there but malee is nowhere to be found
gus begins getting undressed
we follow his shirt to the floor and see malee hiding underneath his bed
malee looks out from underneath the bed
she watches as the now naked gus enters the shower stall in the bathroom
as the water falls upon gus malee rises from underneath the bed and crosses over to him
from over guss shoulder we see malee approaching
an inch away from gus malee reaches out her hand to touch him
suddenly gus breaks down and starts crying
unsettled malee slowly retreats out of the bathroom
malee leonard and jacob sit playing life the board game
dont worry white male infants are the hardest to come by
minutes did a whole story on it
since when do you watch minutes
since i was in the hospital
they said any adoption agency worth its salt has at least a three year waiting list
by the time your parents get a kid youll be in college
you think theyll want to start over again with that baby shit
no but its like theyre trying to replace rudy
it doesnt matter cause its not gonna happen
malee has been silent this entire time
seeing a moment she speaks up
to leanard can you get us some drinks
because its the gentlemanly thing to do
ill get the drinks
ill go with you
why are you all of a sudden going to get the drinks
bitchy because youve upset me and i dont want to see you right now
leonard looks to jacob
fine ill get the drinks
malee turns to jacob
i need a favor
i need you to hide something for me
malee reaches into her back pack
promise you wont freak
malee removes gus gun
jacob contd holy shit
you said you wouldnt freak
thats a gun
whered you get it
i cant tell you
i just need you to hide it for a while
when all is cool ill come for it
why cant you keep it
my mother is a total snoop
she goes through my stuff like all the time
beat please jacob
somebodys life might depend on it
jacob crosses to his closet removes his metal lock box and opens it
jacob takes the gun and places it inside
is it loaded
no but i do have some bullets
malee reaches into her backpack and removes the bullets
jacob takes them out and puts them in the lock box
malee contd contd sure your parents wont find it
nobody has the combination but me
besides i could be building a bomb in here and they wouldnt even know
off jacob locking the box up
on two feet running
we reveal that its leonard
his once skin tight sweat suit hangs off of him
more than just skinny leonard is in perfect shape
he runs fast carefully avoiding puddles of melting snow
spring is fast on the horizon
jacob and kenny talk via one way phone
their demeanor has changed since last we saw them
no longer fraught with contempt and acrimony they speak like two old friends
i sent in some comics for ya
the x men one is pretty sweet
that last batch was awesome
jacob checks his watch
i better get going i dont want to miss my bus
before you go i got some news
apparently the parole board feels ive been a model prisoner so theyre giving me early release
how can they do that
i dont know
they just did
youre pissed arent you
i knew you would be
off jacobs silence it was an accident jacob
so youre getting out
gonna head back to school or
im going to live with my dad in new mexico
hes working on a ranch out there
you cant leave the state
that violates your probation
youll have to
my dad wont tell anyone
no one will even care im out there
your mom will
jacob in the entire time ive been locked up you were the only one who came to see me
trust me she wont care
malee fans out a fist full of twenty dollar bills
dad sent me dollars
yacco smiling gets ready for work
malee contd contd i have to call him
covering your father
hes not home right now
malee eyes her mother suspicious
youre acting weird
whats going on
well do you want to come with me to the mall and spend it
id prefer it if youd put that money in the bank
off malees look fine spend it
youll have to do it alone though
i have a patient this afternoon
have a good day
yacco exits the kitchen
malee looks at her cash and smiles
leonard patrick and grace sit at the kitchen table
heres the deal
you know how my company flies me to florida every april
you and i have been going since i was eight
its the guys week off
this year im taking the girls
just the girls
youre staying home
why cant we all go
im not staying here all alone
besides you said it yourself youve been going for years
give your sisters a chance
leonard eyes his mother with hatred
beat i need money
nothing i have fits anymore
your father and i arent rich
you cant get a new wardrobe anytime you want
what am i supposed to do go to school naked
wear a belt
ill give him some cash he can get some clothes
hes gonna gain all his weight back in a few months
grace contd then what we have to buy him new clothes all over again
obviously hurt leonard storms out of the kitchen
grace exits the kitchen
i thought you hated going to florida
leonard and jacob play catch with a football
when i was fat
now i dont have to wear a t shirt when i go swimming
who knows maybe i could even get lucky
youre still ugly though
leonard punches jacobs arm in fun
i dont understand what my mothers problem is
its like the thinner i get the more she hates me
shes probably jealous
maybe you should put her on that diet
anytime i mention it my mother goes crazy
if you really want her to drop a few tons put her in jail
kennys lost about pounds since hes been incarcerated and he was already thin
jail is the perfect weight loss program
you take a fat tub throw them in a room and force them to eat right and exercise
dont let them out till they do
off leonard thinking yacco enters malees room
yacco notices a number of department store bags strewn everywhere
yacco contd malee
noticing something oh my god
reveal malee standing across the room
she is no longer the gawky adolescent girl
rather she has been transformed into a beautiful young woman
her glasses have been replaced by contacts and her braided pig tails by a quaff of chin length curls
yacco contd contd what did you do
i got a new look
you know for spring
what do you think
malee spins around giving yacco the full picture
what happened to your glasses
it took me like forty five minutes to get them in but beauty is pain
honey in the future id like to know if youre going to radically change your appearance
clean your stuff up and come down for dinner
malee looks in the mirror deflated
gus watches a cement truck dumping cement into a foundation
once the cement is poured the truck pulls forward
malee is revealed standing there and holding a picnic basket
gus sees the new and improved malee for the first time
his jaw drops
my god you look
you look beautiful
off malees smile gus and malee eat their lunch
i felt like i needed a change you know
i bet youre driving the boys at school wild
boys my age are so immature
im more attracted to older gentlemen
malee smiles at gus
he knows where this is going and hes suddenly nervous
you dont want somebody that much older than you
an age difference can cause problems
what kind of problems
a lot of times when a couple has an age difference they wind up splitting up because they want different things
you mean sex
gus catches a look of relief on malees face
gus contd i mean yeah
you may be but a boy even three years older than you is probably more experienced
boys can be impatient about that sort of thing
are you impatient
no but when i was a kid
why dont you have a girlfriend
i did but it didnt work out
how old was she
about my age
see that age wasnt an issue yet you still wanted different things
i dont think its about age
malee contd i think when two people connect they connect for other reasons
and since soulmates are eternal they have no age
gus is stumped
leonard watches patrick and his sisters drive off in a calling after them have a good flight
the taxicab disappears down the street
as leonard turns back around he sees grace staring at him from the window
they lock eyes for a moment and then grace disappears into the dark recesses of the home
leonard descends the staircase and begins looking around at the setting
boxes of junk clutter the floor along with old furniture and bicycles
he crosses to the basement door which leads out to the backyard
as leonard unlocks and opens the door a mass of cobwebs stretch across the frame like elastic bands
leonard grabs a nearby broom and starts wiping away the cobwebs
jacob sits at his desk reading the plastic surgery pamphlet his parents had given him for his birthday last year
the bedroom door opens and ashley sticks her head in
could you come downstairs for a minute
we have a surprise for you
jacob stands in front of keith gardner african american sweet faced and dressed in a shirt and tie
he has luggage with him
ashley and jim stand behind the boys beaming
this is keith gardner
youre new brother
keith our son jacob
keith extends his hand
its nice to meet you
jacob leads keith inside
you get top bunk
im kind of afraid of heights
sucks to be you
keith lets jacobs attitude pass
jacob contd contd no offence but i never thought my future brother would be a
well a brother
i never thought my future brother would have a kool aid stain smeared across his face
fuck you its a birthmark
were getting off on the wrong foot
when my parents said they were taking in an orphan i pictured a baby
so what happened your parents die or something
i was given up at birth
you gonna try and find your mother when youre
as far as im concerned the fact she had me was enough
i dont need to show up one day and disrupt her life
oh but its okay to just show up one day and disrupt mine
off keiths hurt look malee stands at the card catalogue flipping through the s section
she comes to cards with the word sex in the title
malee enters her room locks the door behind her and empties her bag of sex books on the bed
the first one she peruses is the karma sutra
at first glance malees eyes go wide in shock
she grabs her backpack and removes a number of index cards
malee starts taking notes
jacob is on the one way phone with kenny
hes not some baby
youre blaming me for this
but can you believe it
maybe this is the only way they can get over rudys death
hes a person not a fucking vase
i gotta get out of there
i cant live in that house for one more day
i want to go with you to new mexico
youve never even been out on the road
its not easy
after first night falls youll be pissing yourself
no i wont
you dont need me to run away from home
thats not what this is about
yes it is
beat and you want to come with me of all people
are you forgetting i was the one who killed rudy
that was an accident
kenny appears stunned
jacob has never accepted that truth
jacob contd contd ill be helpful
i can get everything well need together
as soon as youre released we can go
kenny appears to be weighing the decision
jacob contd contd please
if this is what you want
yacco is on the phone with her ex husband
im not asking for much
just call her from time to time
because she needs to know her father cares
malee enters the kitchen
is that dad
can i talk to him
take some responsibility for yourself and grow
yacco slams the phone down
yacco contd contd he hung up
well what do you expect
all you ever do is yell at him
malee you dont understand
hes my dad
im sorry if it bothers you but i love him
you keep this up then one day when im old enough ill leave here and go and stay with him
malee runs out of the room leaving a disappointed yacco
leonard hammers a piece of wood over the basement door which is now entirely boarded up
reveal the basement
boxes furniture and trash are piled neatly in a corner
only a mattress remains on the floor in the center of the room
leonard grabs a grocery bag and crosses to a bathroom at the opposite end of the basement
leonard turns on the light revealing a shower toilet and sink
he removes toiletries from the grocery bag and places them inside
grace watches family feud while eating cake
oh god ma
grace drops her fork
grace jumps up and runs out of the room
grace opens the door to the staircase which leads to the basement
screaming leonard whats wrong
its on top of me
i cant get up
oh theres so much blood
get it off me first
if i go downstairs i wont be able to make it back up
let me call first okay
leonard doesnt answer her
grace contd contd leonard
grace contd contd oh jesus
grace begins walking downstairs
due to her size she has difficultly maneuvering through the tight space
her inability to see her feet isnt helping matters
grace makes it downstairs but leonard is nowhere in sight
grace contd contd leonard
suddenly leonard bursts through the bathroom door with a hammer in hand
he runs past grace and up the stairs
grace contd contd what the hell
half way up the stairs leonard stops and pries two of the steps off the stair case with his hammer
this creates a gap making it virtually impossible for grace to ascend
grace contd contd what are you doing
i cant climb up now
leonard runs upstairs and slams the door after him
grace contd contd leonard
malee watches as gus enters his car and drives off
malee crosses to gus door with a grocery bag in hand
she kicks the welcome mat aside picks up the spare key and enters
malee enters and removes a pair of rubber gloves a bottle of ammonia and trash bags
she starts cleaning
leonard descends the staircase holding a tray of food
grace instantly rises
i hope someone is hungry
get me out of here now
no joke ma
for the next two weeks while dad and the girls are away you will be kept down here
ill provide you with nutritious meals and plenty of water
you mother will learn what it means to be healthy
thats what this is about food
im trying to save your life mom
trying to give you a life
cause i love you
my life is fine
i dont need you to save me
leonard looks at his mother sympathetic
you dont even realize how sick you are
its a problem when an otherwise healthy woman cant drag her ass up a flight of stairs because shes so obese
youre staying down here
leonard turns and crosses back to the staircase
leonard contd contd oh and no cigarettes either
the kitchen is now spotless
malee removes two tv dinners from the oven
she crosses over to the kitchen table and places the food onto plates
the table is set to the nines
a small candle burns in the center
once the table is set and the food served malee takes a step back and smiles
malee strips off her clothes and puts on a long silk robe
gus drives up gets out of his car and enters the building
gus approaches his door
as he takes out his key he notices that the welcome mat has been pushed off to the side
gus lifts the mat up and sees that his spare key is gone
he knows someone else is in there
we follow him into the kitchen and find malee standing beside the table and dressed only in her robe
gus contd contd what the hell is this
i made dinner my love
and i have a surprise
youve been in my apartment before havent you
malee drops her robe revealing her naked body
gus quickly looks away
gus contd contd malee put your clothes on now
dont you like my body
malee starts walking towards him
its okay because i love you
gus doesnt answer
malee is right behind him now
she puts her head on his back
malee contd contd touch me
gus slowly turns around and looks at malee for a long pregnant beat
its a tense moment and we are unsure of what hes going to do
then gus moves past her and crosses to the living room
malee contd where are you going
to go call your mother
malee stands the fool
but were soulmates
now embarrassed and crushed she starts to cry
malee now wrapped in a large overcoat is led by yacco out of the building and over to her car
yacco and malee sit in silence
after a beat
i dont know what to say to you
jacob shoves clothes into his backpack
keith enters with rudys baseball glove on his hand
wanna play some catch
jacob notices the glove
he rushes over to keith yanks it off his hand and pushes keith to the ground
where the hell did you get this
ow whats wrong
keith struggles to get free but jacob is too strong
keith contd contd youre hurting me
did i say you could play with the glove
no i just
everything and i mean everything in this room is mine
you are not allowed to touch a thing especially the glove
jacob gets off of keith and crosses to his closet
he pulls out the lock box unlocks it and removes the gun
he points it at keith
if you tell my parents what i said ill kill you
ill shoot you in the fucking face i swear it
keith nods petrified
jacob puts the gun back in the lock box throws it in the closet and storms out of the room
ashley sits at the kitchen table looking at a picture of rudy and jacob when they were infants
her eyes are filled but shes not crying
jacob enters and crosses to the fridge
he spots ashley and is taken aback by her state
cold whats wrong now
i was looking at a picture of you and rudy when you were born
god i miss him
but you have keith now ashley is struck by jacobs comment
what the hell does that mean
you have keith
two boys again
everything is fine
we didnt adopt keith to replace rudy
for your information your father and i discussed adopting for years
not buying it right
maybe if it was me who died you wouldnt need another kid to get over it
how can you say that
i never wanted either of my children to die
but one of us did
if you had to choose which one i bet you wish it was me
i know you think we favored rudy
i admit he was easier to raise but we didnt love him more
jacob listen to me
you came with a different set of challenges
its not easy being different
screams im not different
you always made me feel like something was wrong
theres nothing wrong with me
no you dont
its like you dont know how to deal with me
you never did
im sorry if that is how you feel
you do the best you can as a parent
you dont always know whats right
but youre my son
id do anything for you
id fight for you id kill for you id die for you
rudy used to say that exact same thing
and as unchristian as it sounds i still want the boy that killed rudy dead
someday when you grow up youll understand what i mean
grace exits the bathroom and begins walking around the basement looking for a way out
she crosses to the boarded up door and tries to pull the boards off
unsuccessful she returns to the bed and sits
after a beat grace spots the tray of food which is still untouched
angry and disgusted she takes it and throws it at the wall
grace paces nervously while blabbering to herself
when pat calls and i dont answer hell know something is wrong
ill be fine
grace nervously rocks back and forth
sweat covers her body
she glances at the tray of food which rests on the floor
grace stands at the base of the stairwell screaming
open this door now
let me out god damn it
grace is crying
she catches sight of the meal that she threw on the floor
after a beat grace crawls over to it and starts shoving it down her throat
she doesnt seem bothered by the fact that her dinner is covered with dirt
yacco exits her office to find gus waiting for his session
they speak not a word
he rises and enters the office
she follows shutting the door behind her
gus and yacco sit in their respective seats
before we begin i want to apologize
i should have known what was going on with malee
its my fault
i knew she had a crush on me
i guess i felt bad for her
shes a very unhappy girl
yacco looks down embarrassed
gus contd contd if its any consolation the whole thing was very therapeutic for me
off yaccos look sorry
that was a very selfish thing to say
this is your therapy
why was it therapeutic
i slept last night
i cant remember the last time i slept so deep or so sound
i dont remember dreaming or anything
why do you think that is
one of the last fires i ever fought was a brownstone beautiful
the place was burned from roof to basement
whole family was wiped out
when i was upstairs inspecting i found a girl
she couldnt have been more than
gus contd the whole right side of her face was burnt off but her eyes were open
she was alive
the pain must have been excruciating
she was begging for me to
what did you do
exactly what she wanted
i placed my hand over her mouth and what was left of her nose and i
i killed her
i told myself it was the right thing to do but ive never been sure
what does this have to do with malee
when i saw her last night she had the same look on her face as that girl
she just wanted me to take away her pain
yacco sits pondering all of this
gus contd contd doctor
would you mind if we
cut out early today
gus rises and exits
yacco sits alone and starts crying
leonard is at the kitchen sink arranging a fruit salad
suddenly he hears the sound of water boiling over from the stove
leonard quickly turns the gas low extinguishing the flame
he removes the pot from the burner grabs a strainer and removes poached egg whites from the water
leonard grabs a dish towel and begins wiping the water off the stove
preoccupied he doesnt realize that when he wipes the oven knob dry he turns the gas on high
since the overflowing water extinguished the pilot light he is unaware that gas is now being emitted from the burner
in his condition he wont be able to smell it
leonard grabs the plates of food and exits the kitchen
leonard places the food by graces bed
she is sleeping
leonard sits on the couch watching tv
suddenly he starts coughing hard
the fit subsides and leonard resumes watching tv thinking nothing of it
malee enters the kitchen and answers the phone
no shes not home
can i ask you something
can i visit you for a while
but i can fly alone
no i understand
i love y
malee hangs up the phone
tears swell in her eyes
she places her head in her arms and start bawling
malee looks to find yacco standing behind her
through her tears why does he hate me
yacco walks to malee and hugs her tight
its a long overdue hug
grace awakens from her nap
suddenly she sniffs at the air
grace rises and crosses over to the foot of the basement stairs
she sees that the upstairs door is wide open
grace contd contd leonard i smell gas
leonard is slumped over unconscious
grace coughs hard
leonard dont you smell that
sotto oh god he cant
leonard the gas is on
grace grabs a hold of the railing and starts climbing the stairs
after a few steps she stops to rest wheezing
with the help of the railing grace pulls herself up to the gap in the staircase
in one forceful exertion she propels her body up and forward
the railing instantly becomes separated from the wall
grace lands in a heap
luckily the top half of her body made it to the other side
with all of her might grace pulls herself up to the landing
exhausted and wheezing grace drags herself over to the stove and shuts the gas off
she looks around for leonard and sees him in the living room slumped over and unconscious
grace frantically shuffles over to the living room
grace contd contd leonard wake up
leonard slowly comes to in a hospital bed
the same nurse from earlier is by his side
my mom shes
theyve taken her into surgery
she blew out her knees somehow
were trying to get your father on the phone right now
you need your rest
everything is fine now
jacob straddles his bike watching a crew spread cement over the foundation of a house
jacob appears lost in thought
he looks at a picture of rudy and himself together
jacob touches his face in the photograph
he traces his finger along the outline of his birthmark
tonight we ride
jacob and kenny share a cigarette
we got sleeping bags a tent canteens and a lantern
kenny contd i heard its supposed to rain so ill bring ponchos

kenny rides off
jacob watches him go
he has a lifeless almost calculating look in his eyes
grace lies in a hosptial bed watching tv
leonard enters dressed in a hospital gown
grace turns to him smiling
im sorry mom
i didnt mean to leave the gas on
it was an accident
and everything that happened i
i just thought that maybe i could help you
leonard my mother died at
we had to cremate her body because they didnt make a coffin big enough for her to fit in
even if they had no one could have carried it
tearing up i loved her so much
i dont want that to happen to me
it doesnt have to
even if i can manage the food
can you honestly see me running a marathon
you dont have to run a marathon
you just have to run to the end of the block
its not so hard as you think it is
leonard leans over and kisses his mothers forehead
grace contd i spoke to your father
he and the girls caught a flight
they should be here by morning
did you tell him what happened
i told him there was a gas leak
i know what you meant
i didnt tell him
i dont think i will
jacob lies awake staring out the window
a heavy wind blows
jacob sits up and silences his watch alarm
keith awakens as well but remains silent
he watches as jacob grabs a bag and exits the house through the window
once hes gone keith gets off the top bunk crosses to the window and watches as jacob runs off
immediately keith crosses to the closet
he removes the lock box and begins trying combinations to open it
a heavy rain begins to fall as jacob rides up
he sees kenny standing inside of a partially constructed house
kenny throws jacob a poncho
put this on
jacob removes his backpack and puts on the poncho
then he opens his backpack and removes his hockey mask
the same mask he was wearing at the beginning of the movie
kenny contd contd what the fuck is that
if people see me riding around in the middle of the night were screwed
you didnt bring a disguise
who gives a shit what im up to
the boys start riding off in opposite directions
kenny contd contd the main road is this way
yeah but if we cut through the construction site well hit the railroad tracks
its faster and no one will bother us
kenny files in behind jacob and the boys make their way deep into the construction site
thunder and lightning crash
keith has forgone opening the lock box via a combination and now tries to pry the top open with a screwdriver
he works frantically fearing jacobs return
jacob and henry make their way to the edge of the construction site
suddenly jacob stops in his tracks
jacob lifts the hockey mask
i cant do this
jacob begins rummaging through his backpack
keith pries the box open
no gun or bullets
son of a bitch
i knew it
i knew youd chicken
jacob rises holding the gun
he points it at kenny
kenny contd contd what the fuck
jacob shakes frightened and reluctant to do what he believes he has to do
i cant let you leave kenny
you have to pay for what you did
whoa whoa hold on
i wont go
ill stay here
ill do my probation
jacob cocks the gun
tears stream down his checks
you killed him
i gotta do this
for my family
its the only way
jacob i told ya it
it was an accident
this isnt you
but i cant be a pussy all my life
kenny is hit in the head
he drops to the ground instantly
the force of the gun knocks jacob to the ground
as he falls the hockey mask comes down over his face
jacob sits for a beat staring at kennys lifeless body
lightning flashes illuminating his blue eyes through the hockey mask
jacob is inside one of the unpaved house foundations digging a hole
he cries struggling to finish what he has done
once a hole is dug jacob throws kennys body inside and starts covering it up with dirt
jacob climbs through his window soaking wet
he crosses to his closet and begins to change
keith lies in bed watching
jacob removes the gun from his pocket and places it back inside the lock box
his hands shake violently
as he puts the box back inside the closet
he finds rudys glove
he smells the leather and smiles
jacob takes the glove and crosses over to his bed
he places the glove beside keith
i thought i wasnt supposed to touch this
just dont leave it outside
if it gets wet the leather will crack
ill take good care of it
i know this was rudys
jacob lies down on his bed
keith contd why do you have a gun
just a b b gun
i returned it to a friend of mine
beat im sorry for being such an asshole to ya
does this mean were brothers now
beat torn apart yeah
keith lies back in bed smiling
jacob rolls over still unnerved by what he is done
hell never be the same and he knows it
gus loads cinder blocks into a wheel barrow
gus spins around and finds malee standing there
malee contd contd before you freak out i want to tell you im sorry
and to give you this
malee opens her backpack and removes gus gun
gus snatches it from her
dont be mad
i was just worried about you
now im out of your life forever
thanks for not pressing any charges
malee walks off
gus holds the gun in awe
tight on jacob staring at the construction site
we zoom out and find him straddling his bike
malee appears walking over
quite a storm last night
they stand for a moment watching the builders
malee contd did you hear about leonard
jacob nods yes
malee contd only him
i was gonna go and visit him at the hospital
you want to come
jacob doesnt answer
he is preoccupied with watching a truck pour cement into the foundation where kenny is buried
its a bittersweet moment
while relieved by the fact that his crime will be hidden the guilt overwhelms him
malee contd earth to jacob
jacob turns his bike around and the two ride off together
you know your birthdays coming up
any hints as to what you might like
whatever you get me will be fine
malee eyes jacob sensing that something is wrong
malee contd contd are you okay
lying never better
back on the foundation
gus enters frame and begins spreading cement over kennys grave
