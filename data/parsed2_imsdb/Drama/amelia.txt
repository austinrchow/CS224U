written by ronald bass anna hamilton phelan september close on a mud streaked airfield in mist and driving rain
a lockheed electra sits
sleek twin engine state of the art its metallic surface battered by the monsoon
pull back to see
our view down onto the landing strip is from an open sided thatched roof bar high above the airfield
and peering down through the mist and rain
a woman in grimy flight clothes gazes at the plane
at first glance fragile
then the gray eyes change like the sea as a stray thought transforms her
something fierce lives there
sure i cant talk you inta somethin more adventurous
fred noonan is tall and lean ruggedly handsome in a reckless way
his flight clothes as rumpled and dirt streaked as her own
he carries his bottle of tequila and a coke which he sets down for her
youve got the wrong girl mister
you should know that by now
her eyes study him
assessing something as he pours himself four fingers
i knew that the moment i met ol george
he sips his drink
she says nothing
i like how you dont talk about him
that why i get so many chances to not do it
his charming smile
shes thinking more about the tequila
she reaches to take his bottle and glass
moves them to her side of the table
i mean why would a guy who needs to run the show
pick the one girl he knew could kick his tail
just her clear direct gaze
ill bet he knew that
first time he met you
she looks out to sea
he thought i hated him
he never knew i was fascinated
alone by the window he gazes at the city
a powerfully built man in a perfectly tailored suit
the face at once strong and elegant capable of every emotion
yet just now there are none to be seen
a door opens
a pretty secretary enters soundlessly sits respectfully
waits her pen suspended above her steno pad
does he know shes there
without turning the first time i met her she sat in that chair
the secretary doesnt know whether to write that down
and still with his back to her
you may as well write it down mary
write it all down
even the parts that are confused or graceless or boring
he turns with a soft smile to put her at ease
well see if i remember how to edit
she smiles back
she likes him as much as her level of being awed by him permits
she begins to write as
id kept her waiting two hours
she hated me on sight but she hought i couldnt tell
his gaze drifts to a bookcase crammed with volumes
and one object oddly out of place
a stuffed cat with boots and a green frock coat
it wears a confident ironic smile
she was a person who cherished her privacy and was devoting her life to social work
and there i was
his smile is kind
and honestly self mocking
wallowing in the glory of my authors and celebrity acquaintances
a vain fast talking manipulator
but then i guess you know all that dont you
she looks up reproachfully
nothing of the kind and you know it
and the kind of man who fishes for compliments
hes made her laugh
she is younger dressed conservatively
the calm at the center of a storm
agents authors couriers peddlers come and go
but she has her legs drawn up beneath her pouring through a small stack of volumes
as if preparing for an exam
the waiting made her furious
she undoubtedly felt i was stablishing my dominance and importance
she doesnt look furious at all
thumbing through we by col
photos of lindy beside the spirit of st
louis in paris
actually i hadnt given her a thought
oblivious as usual
which perhaps was even worse
now skyward by adm
photos of the explorer preparing for his flight over the north pole
one of byrd with george himself displaying considerable gravitas
i figured hed be pompous
her eye travels over the stack of books
adventurers explorers celebrities
on an end table a framed photo of george with the great lindbergh
a pretty secretary comes to summon her
amelia rises smooths the wrinkles from her brown suit
they head down the corridor
i knew of course that he wasnt going to choose me
i had no discernible qualifications whatsoever
they reach the door already ajar
it says george palmer putnam on a small bronze plate
the secretary gingerly pushes it open
revealing george on the phone in crisp shirtsleeves and suspenders
he paces prowls trailing the cord behind him negotiating non stop even as he flips through a pile of messages
off again stalking the room
dashing electric masterful
but to be rejected by this
a man who had given up any life of his own to flutter near the famous
he glances up realizing for the first time that she is there
but she doesnt
i didnt know whether to laugh or throw something at the jerk
he gestures again more commandingly
she doesnt move she doesnt smile
she doesnt take her steady gaze from him
he hangs up the phone
they stare at each other for a frozen beat
he breaks the moment with a charming smile
george softly i asked you to sit
was that the thing you did with your hand
sadly i dont speak dog
his smile now only a trace
but more genuine
well stand if you like
im told you want to fly the atlantic ocean
in the months since lindbergh people in planes have tried
three planes made it
fourteen people have died
ill make it
three women died trying
two others escaped with their lives
if you do make it youd be the first
is the real attraction for both of us i suspect
always nice to know what the real attraction is
beginning to enjoy this conversation
the plane was bought from adm
byrd by amy guest a socialite who wanted the record for herself
her family wouldnt tolerate the danger
she has asked for a replacement
who is american educated well spoken a flyer preferably physically attractive
why would that matter
because she wants the world to pay attention
and pretty girls command more attention
was that your advice
my role is selling this event to the public
there will be a contract for the girls story with the new york times
also a book to be published over her name
g but all the money from these will go to mrs
except for the part that goes to you
which will be as great as i can manage i assure you
you said she wants a flyer
dont get your hopes up
the celebrated wilmer stultz will be the pilot
therell be a male co pilot and navigator
the woman will be purely a passenger
he waits for reaction
she keeps her mouth shut
thats good for your chances
because your level of flying experience wouldnt place you anywhere near the group that would be considered for this
if the woman were to do any flying at all
no punches pulled
not his style
why would anyone want a book from a passenger
because the hook is that were making the woman the commander
the pilot will sign a contract saying he is under her direction and control
its her ship her flight
good for my chances you said
what are my chan
the jobs yours
i chose you the moment you walked through the door
he smiles his charming smile
several phones are ringing
now assuming my awful manners havent soured you on the enterprise
may i give you a lift to the station
is she pissed at being toyed with
youre a busy man mr
i can find my way
the look holds
you probably can
two figures on the platform
her train is ready to leave
i honestly feel an apology is in order
what have i done
she watches his smile
i didnt mind waiting
caught up on my reading
knitted a sweater
i mean an apology
for whats coming
his voice softens
im going to be pretty controlling these next few months
how you dress move cut your hair
speak in public
its all part of the package were selling
if youre not in there selling with me it wont work
the smile turns friendly
youre the star
im no one at all
spoken like a gentleman
she steps up onto the train
extends her hand like a man
he shakes it firmly
the train begins to move
she watches his cheery wave as she rolls away
of course a gentleman
would have paid for my ticket
gazing out the window as she rattles toward boston
she looks down now to a notebook in her lap
as she flips pages we see it is a collection of hand written poems and thoughts
courage is the price that life exacts for granting peace we superimpose over her image the wall of a little girls bedroom filled with treasured newspaper clippings about women doctors
officials bank presidents women who had established themselves in positions previously thought to be available only to men
the soul that knows it not knows no release from little things two little girls maybe years old walking in a field
amelia and a girlfriend
they stop hearing
the droning of an engine a small red plane appearing above the treetops
the pilot seeing two girls alone in the field swoops down to buzz them
amelias friend runs for her life
but amelia stands still throws her arms wide and the plane
drops lower and lower as it closes straight in on the slender girl with her outstretched arms
louder and faster as if intent on winning some impulsive duel of wills
the aircraft screams past just above her head
as the little red airplane passed by it said something to me
she fills her lungs transported
i dont think ive ever stopped listening
hold on her hair and uniform whipping in the breeze
amelia flying her little yellow kinner
feeling the freedom she thrilled to as a a child
ten years jobs and an unspeak able number of crashes later i hadnt changed my mind
she lifts the nose of the tiny craft
begins to climb
i even had my own plane
bought with my last dime
at the apex of her climb she flips into a breathtaking loop the loop as
course in the early days of flying
her engine sputters
the plane dips into a tail spin plunging downward
crashing was so common you almost forgot it could kill you
amelia struggling to start the engine the little plane hurtling toward earth spinning as it goes
until it did
the engine coughs to life and at the last second she swoops harrowingly above the ground to soar free
a small hangar in a lonely field
see a group of
mechanics in their grease stained jumpsuits
three big guys and one little one working on an engine thats been pulled from amelias kinner
when the little guy comes up for air
he isnt a guy at all
sam chapman a handsome young man is being led down an institutional hallway and out onto the grounds of this venerable settlement house
amelia sitting cross legged on the grass
reading to a group of chinese girls who hang on her every animated word
on the periphery adults sit taking in the story
they are of various ethnicities homeless or handicapped or immigrant
two are blind
amelia sees sam
girls this is mr
sam say hullo to the octopus club
the octopus club waves to sam
the adults wave too
youre just in time
alice has come through the looking glass and things are getting well
on cue they are actually
she pats the grass beside her
sam has no choice but to sit
amelia and sam walk a wooded path beside the grounds
through the chain link fence they watch other social workers playing with groups of children
and its a secret
has to be
competition you know
millionaire heiresses hot shot girl pilots
if george knew i told you hed have me publicly flogged
she looks over
so long as he could sell tickets
hes not smiling
and no one else knows
shes giving me a leave of absence
i would think so
your name will be in all the papers and not just boston
denison house stands to come in for funding national attention
specially if i dont make it
dont joke about that
she wasnt joking at all
youll make it
and then youll have opportunities to work in aviation
anywhere you want
well ill have impressive credentials as a long distance passenger
thats not exactly a career in aviation
she looks up at his eyes
m not going anywhere social work is my life
after all the years of false starts i found the thing im meant to do
she gives him time to say
and where does that leave us
you do love to look on the dark side
whatever did you see in a sunny character like me
she gives him a sweet playful smile
it doesnt reassure him
its not as if id been putting pressure on you
what love means to you
what it requires
is the pressure
he stops walking
i love you
is that such a terrible problem
she gazes at him
can he even hear this
the problem is what its always been
the problem is me
movietone newsreel footage accompanied by their signature fanfare theme
hotel conference room jammed with press
a sexy brunette in a sweater that seems to be made of strips of gold foil steps to a bank of microphones
flashes start the queen of diamonds mabel boll about to become the first female to fly the atlantic in the wake of lindberghs historic journey regales an eager world press
the sound switches to mabel at the mikes
ill take any questions you wanna throw my way
except about whats behind this sweater
the boys roar
mabel keeps her smile tight
as the laughter continues
he heavy door rolls open
george and amelia enter the brightly lit hangar to see two men working on the friendship a sea plane with golden wings
its red orange fuselage stands beside gigantic pontoons each feet long
the pontoons have been opened and the men are attaching them to the plane
they turn toward us now
bill stultz is short and wiry with quick eyes
only he seems weathered by his adventures and the streaks of gray through his hair
he is not necessarily happy to see us
george had told me stultz was adm
byrds favorite pilot fearless gifted
but george said it never affected his work
george waves as we approach
bill and amelia seem locked on each other
when he said it i must have had a funny look
so i just said yeh i grew up around a guy like that
boys id like to introduce your commander miss amelia earhart
we felt commander was less grandiose than say empress
bill doesnt smile
the other man does
say hello to slim gordon your navigator
she is shaking hands in that strong direct way
and bill stultz here simply the most talented pilot working
she takes bills powerful hand
the look between them calm yet somehow intense
as if each is establishing a tone for their relationship
weve got byrds pilot weve got his plane
ou mean the admiral flies on those
she does not seem admiring
nope those are new personally suggested by the old man himself
bill nods on that
this way if youre forced down at sea you can wait for a rescue
what does that do to our fuel
costs us at least gallons
dont bother bringing clothes for paris well be lucky to hit the nearest beach in ireland
the admiral estimates the pontoons only cut our range by miles
but amelia looks to bill
thats not really possible is it
the admiral is the admiral
he gets to estimate any damn thing he wants
all we have to do is figure out how to fly without petrol
she turns to george with challenging eyes
dont go blaming the bookseller
hes been all through this with mrs
guest but she worships the admiral
and its money that puts planes in the air
i wonder if it can keep them up there
not that ive ever had enough to try
bills small smile
maybe the girls all right
george and amelia approach a waiting motorboat as the lights of boston glimmer across the harbor
his head is down
shes watching his profile
ill try keeping my mouth shut
what i ought to try
is listening to you once in awhile
e meant that
and she seems oddly touched
i could get to like it
no reaction from him
he hops into the boat
turns holds out his hand
clearly doesnt need his help to jump into a boat
their eyes lock
we are watching her decide
she reaches to clasp his hand
hops down beside him
thank you simpkin
thank you for everything
a smile simpkin
its in a book
oh thats right
you read the ones you publish
her smile is friendly not flirtatious
she goes to sit in the bow
he doesnt follow
but he is watching
amelia in a flying outfit
hands on her hips as if posing
theres a beatrix potter story about a cat named simpkin
pull back to see the photographer george beside him
they are on a hotel rooftop precariously high above boston
he wasnt happy unless he had several mice each under a different teacup
so he could never become bored
we see that amelias pose looks exactly the same as a photo of charles lindbergh in the photographers hand
it is labeled lucky lindy
the illusion of activity was essential for him to feel at peace
the photographer now shows george another photo of lindbergh in a different pose
what are you boys doing over there
trying to make you look like a girl
george studies the photo then goes to amelia and begins moving her body into the new pose
tilting her head to lindberghs angle
was i mr
putnams rd mouse
or his th
now touching her adjusting her coat fluffing a bit of her hair pulling the collar around to frame her face
he more we can make you look like a girl the better
oh god is it worth the effort
he cocks his head studies her
nah guess not
wondering who should play you in the film of all this
im thinking chaplin
valentinos not available
he shakes his head sadly
adjusts her collar once more
this time his hands linger
one chaplin cant play me because hes perfect for you
and two you have company
she glances to where a woman beautiful and aristocratic is being helped onto the roof
georges face lights to see her
he rushes over sweeps her into his arms kisses her tenderly
amelia smiles to see this makes her like them both
amelia earhart this is dorothy binney putnam
the women trade smiles
they shake hands holding eye contact
great to meet you
george talks so much about you
a wink in fact lately youre all he does talk about
george steps in close and the photographer snaps a three shot
hold those smiles for one more please
the friendship bobbing on its pontoons
bill and slim are off loading equipment and other gear from the plane to a tugboat filled with support crew and family
the planes engines rev in the predawn stillness
pull back to see
the yacht club dock
george and amelia alone at the railing
shes wearing her leather flight jacket and boots
they stare out at the plane so frail and awkward
from her bag now she pulls three envelopes
puts them in georges hand
popping off letters
for my dad my mom my sis
he stares down
rocked by the weight of this against the simplicity of her words
the top envelope says dearest im honored
that youd leave these with me
if i do pop off its your fault
said in her sunny way
but shes not kidding
it takes a beat before he can offer
ill call them once youre safely on your way
sam will handle that
they trust him
ive figured out the simpkin thing you know
there are so few books i havent published it was easy to find
beatrix potter the tailor of gloucester
hes a cat in a green frock coat
but why is he you
hes brilliant charismatic
so you havent actually read it
do you actually read
neurotic compulsive manipulative
am i getting warmer
ray i make it
or the secret pops off with me
a held look
she walks off down the dock toward the friendship
e stands watching her go
amelia alone leaving her hotel room in her flight jacket
locking the door
our first hop was to canada to start from as close as we could get to ireland
just in case we couldnt get the thing in the air and had to row
she walks briskly down the corridor
the fuel was going to be so close every single mile counted
turns a corner
approaches the dining room door
george told me to keep to my room just in case there was a reporter or two somewhere
she enters the hotel dining room
across the room a disgruntled bill and a sheepish slim stare at her from their breakfast surrounded by reporters and photographers
half a dozen cameras rise as one
it is a defining moment
cocks her head
throws an effortless golden smile
hi there boys
how are the ham and eggs
the flashes explode as one
they keep popping as amelia makes her way to them
dont blame us lady
i think somebodys starting to sell books
the reporters are handing her their morning editions
the new york times front page headline boston girl starts for there beneath the headline the glamorous photo we watched being taken on the copley hotel roof lady lindy
next to it an earlier photo of her as a demure social worker
melia is sifting through the other papers grinning and shaking her head
what have you got for mabel boll to chew on
now why would a famous gal like mabel give a thought to someone like me
i dont have a single sweater made out of gold
the boys roar slim louder than anyone
even bill cracks a smile
theyre shouting teasing you cant kid us
hey not even silver
the boys make room
bill rises to hold amelias chair
a friendly murmur
the hams a little tough commander
but the bacons swell
movietone newsreel footage accompanied by their signature fanfare theme
once more the hotel conference room jammed with press
today mabel wears a luxurious silver fox coat shimmies up to a bank of microphones at the podium
flashes start popping
the queen of diamonds mabel boll upstaged by upstart social worker seems madder than a rich wet hen
hey mabel tell us about your rival
the sound switches to mabel leaning her sultry voice to the mikes
well how would any woman feel about some tart who steals her man
reporters furiously writing more flashes explode
bill stultz and i were going to make history together until this poor little social worker and her sugar daddy oh excuse me publisher started throwing money and i dont
know what else at him
mabel are you implying miss earhart used her feminine charms on your pilot
i dont know charlie i never seen her
has she got any
laughter theyre all calling out
she shows them a smoky smile but stays on message
well she had to use something on somebody to get from nowhere to here
you figure it out or wait til george putnam feeds it to you
two dozen questions at once
shes not even listening
were going to canada waiting for some good weather on the atlantic and then well kick little miss whoozis in the keester
what makes you so cocky that she wont leave first
rusty we can carry enough fuel to go to china
that thing theyre flying cant load enough gas to make yonkers
tell that to putnams girlie
and while youre at it
she snuggles the gleaming fox fur around her
tell her i do wear silver
so im two up on her
movietone newsreel continues
we are looking at foggy bleak trepassey harbor as the friendship makes an unsuccessful attempt to take off
eleven days of failure for plucky amelia earhart and her crew
if it isnt storms over the atlantic its the inability of the seaplanes pontoons to lift from the sea
eries of angles
one failed take off after another
perhaps its for the best
remember no woman has beat the jinx of the atlantic and three have died trying
including a princess and the niece of former president woodrow wilson
the planes engine sputters and stalls
it floats on the sea
maybe this ones not to be
hows your weather report
amelia coming down the hotel corridor
she passes a room and hearing drunken laughter from a group of men within the room
stares at the door with more concern than anger
bill slim and three of the reporters are drinking up a storm
amelia curled up on her bed with charts of the atlantic spread everywhere
from next door the sound of drunken men amelia looks down from her charts
her mind going to
seven year old kids dressed as cowboys and indians are gathered on the front lawn of a white clapboard home
we close on a clear eyed tomboy with war paint and tousled hair amelia at seven looking up excitedly as a car pulls to the curb
er father climbs slowly from the car wobbles his way across the lawn
the kids part to let him through the confusion and disappointment on every face
he ignores them all even amelia
the front door opens
amelias mother gazes at him with shame and disdain
as she helps him stagger inside
amelia in her flight gear sitting on the edge of her bed an open telegram lies beside her
her elbows rest on her knees
her hands are locked together
her profile is stony determined
tilt down to the telegram
it reads weather permitting mabel flies this afternoon
she grabs her flight bag leaves the room
she only has to travel as far as the next door
pounds on it
pounds louder with both fists
slim opens the door
bill sits up in bed groggy disoriented
christ what time is
time to fly
get up get dressed were going now
she is calm and angry at once
a powerful combination
slim pulls his pants off a chair
wheres the weather report
she goes to his bed
hands him a slip of paper
he blinks still waking up
its not good enough
maybe mabel will think so too
because if she doesnt shes going to paris and youre going home
its not good enough
its fine theres a tail wind all the way well off load to gallons which gets us off the water and the wind gets us to ireland
weve had better than this and we havent gone
but this is the day mabels ready so were going now
the weather is going to get better and well be there to enjoy it
just as serious as youre hung over
to slim you go now get the late weather well meet you at the plane
slim pulls on his shoes grabs his jacket his bag
looks to bill but the pilot is glaring at his commander
slim get out
ive got this
slim goes the door shuts quietly
amelia sits on the edge of bills bed
ive loved one person unconditionally bill
he is the most caring and generous and charming and flat out funny guy ill ever know
hes my father
her eyes are burning with this
and bill keeps quiet
hes a drunk
and hes let me down all my life
she leans closer
now you get out of that bed
and you fly that god damned thing to ireland
or i swear to you bill
just above a whisper
i swear to you i will
or die trying
ou got that
and either way
youre going to be living with it
its dark and cold
bill and amelia stand at the dock beside their plane
hes drinking coffee as they watch slim come down the quay with a slip of paper in his hand
amelia steps forward to take it
reads with neutral eyes
slim start the engines
she still hasnt given the paper to bill
slim steps onto a pontoon
starts cranking up the propellers
as the engine kicks to life
she hands the weather report to bill
looks to her eyes
you signed a contract
youve got a direct instruction from me to go
that report indicates some degree of risk and its a risk im taking
have a nice flight
she motions to slim get on board
the navigator grins starts to climb up looking back at bill
hey im scared shitless of this dame
she climbs up after him
one look back
read tomorrows papers bill
well both be in them
alone on the dock bill hears the engines rev
jesus god shes going to do it
he takes a step toward the plane but her head appears in the hatch
so to take off you pull back on the thing right
her perfectly straight innocent face
he busts out laughing
this fucking girl
osses his coffee
with amelia as she locks the hatch
for the first time we can see the inside of the plane
the cabin is too small for anyone to stand
the plane has been emptied of everything but two huge elliptical fuel tanks
he wedges herself between the gigantic tanks
bill pulls the throttle and the fokker tri motor lurches forward straining against the surface of the sea in a rattling throbbing desperately vibrating all out attempt
amelia crawls to the tiny window her face to the glass as chop and spray fly past like shrapnel and the engines whine and pulse louder
twenty seconds thirty
still on the surface
forty seconds fifty her eyes shut her forehead bangs against the glass come on sixty seconds and at
the seaplane lifts struggles then soars free
amelia kneels at the tiny window
a kid on a rainy day
only outside this window is impenetrable fog and a storm that rocks the plane like the shock waves of endless explosions
as she braces herself against the hull
water drips onto her from a loose seam
could this be dangerous
she looks around
through the opening between the elliptical fuel tanks
bill and slim at the controls
bill is banging on something beside the instrument panel
beneath his seat she sees the toolbox
the water drips on her faster
she crawls forward toward the boys arriving to see
bill pounding what we can now see is his radio
his face is red angry
she watches for a beat
he never turns to her but she studies him
is he impaired or simply frustrated
she slips the toolbox from beneath his seat and crawls back to the leak
but as she opens the box
there among the wrench and pliers a bottle of whiskey
she stares at it as we snap to
rapid series of angles
war painted amelia looking up from the cowboy shes tied to a tree
the car pulling to the curb
her father glassy eyed
stumbling through the children
her mother at the door
amelia still in war paint enters her parents room she knows just where to go
opens a drawer digs beneath crisply starched shirts
finds the bottle
amelia in the bathroom pouring the bottle out into the sink
she looks up in the mirror to see
her father in the doorway
she turns straight to him
meets his eyes direct and unafraid
back to amelia with bills bottle as the battered plane lurches every which way in the storm
she lifts it from the toolbox
hides it in the camera bag as suddenly the plane drops fifty feet and amelia is slammed against the ceiling then crashes back to the floor
dazed she sees bill turned around
she grabs the leg of the navigation table which has been bolted down
stares out the window wondering if shell make it
hooray for the last grand adventure
i wish i had won but it was worthwhile anyway
you know that
i have no faith well meet anywhere again but i wish we might
hold on the gray eyes
amelia at the window still opaque with fog
suddenly the plane swoops down toward a clearing in the clouds
there to the south a freighter running across our path
no land in sight
melia scrawls a note ties it to an orange from her flight bag and crawls back to the boys
the boys are studying the freighter
checks his watch
she shows him the note and the orange
bill has to smile
are you serious
as a heart attack
okay he tries to get closer to the ship but were jerked and buffeted as we swing past and amelia
drops the orange toward the freighter watching the heavy winds carry it two hundred yards wide of the mark
our three stare grimly
their eyes are locked
shes been wondering the same
a rare smile
and swoops back on course
amelias hand squeezes his shoulder
amelia crouched behind bills seat
fog starting to break up
her face drawn she almost seems to be holding her breath
something down below
as we drop we hear the engines she glances over to slim who is busy unwrapping a sandwich
she cant believe this
he takes a healthy bite
she crawls back to the navigation table
as she looks out her window a sandwich sails past
she whips around
slims arms raised in jubilation
the little plane sputtering shuddering as bill drops in for a splashdown
we pan to the shore
a rural railroad dock
deserted except for three workers who glance up as the friendship taxis to a buoy a few hundred yards offshore
amelia at the hatch tiny in distance waves a towel
one friendly worker takes off his coat and waves back
then all three guys go back to work
from the friendship we watch the workers ignoring us
bill and slim holler and jump up and down on the pontoons
amelia sits in the doorway her legs swinging free
out of gas
may have to swim for t
six pages written by her side
still working as a rowboat pulls up
bill stands in the bow
calls to her
he says theres fella coming from london
very important man
more important than any of us
he says ya mustnt come ashore til he gets here
no matter what
she doesnt like it but there it is
she waves so long
some kind of royalty is he
goes back to work
amelia sits with her papers in her lap dangling her feet from the hatch
hear the buzz of
a plane dropping slowly from the sky gliding onto the water on its pontoons
she stares at it
gathers up her things
amelia sitting in a tiny dinghy behind her the friendship in distance
she is being rowed to shore
our view is over the back of the man rowing
amelia is staring past him vaguely apprehensive
shes looking at two thousand welshmen swarming the docks
you cant even see the sand
the crowd is silent and staring
as if they were staring at an alien or an animal in the zoo
bill and slim help pull the dinghy to the rocky shore
but when amelia jumps out the crowd
begins to soberly applaud and slowly closes in around her
at first she seems pleased trying to shake every hand thrust toward her
she doesnt see that bill and slim have been shunted to the back
people get bolder
clapping her on the back reaching to touch her someone snatches her scarf she looks around frantically for bill and slim as
a sheriff and three deputies muscle their way to her using billy clubs to push people back
they surround amelia begin to escort her to the station
shoulda brought more men
no really this is very sweet its an honor
im actually enjoying it
thats a good thing
she looks at him as they are jostled along
because youre stuck with it
from here on
she is brought to a smiling avuncular hilton railey standing beside the closest thing burry port has to a limo
she throws an affectionate arm around him kisses his cheek
railey stands back as flashbulbs catch the moment
hes brought photographers with him
amelia say hullo to allen raymond of the new york times
a hearty handshake
she holds out her sheets of paper
i believe youve come for these
both men regard the pages as if they were gold bullion
come for these indeed
movietone footage of amelia being welcomed by a sea of people on the dock at southampton
folks spilling into the water
ships circling fireboats spray every craft blares its horn
police hold back the screaming throng as flashes explode and newsreel cameras churn
amelia at the center of the storm
welcomed by amy guest and the lady lord mayor of southampton
throughout we see superimposed images of the article she gave railey displaying her byline on the front pages of the london times new york times the times of india sydney
morning herald the toronto star le monde as her story echoes around the world
these images continue over
quick series of angles

watching tennis at wimbledon
front row gallery at the house of commons as
a whirlwind week for bostons amelia earhart our own lady lindy
races at ascot on gold cup day
watching helen wills moody play at wimbledon
lady astors guest at the house of commons
movietone newsreel continues
the british press are gathered in a huge victorian parlor
dark woods rich leather a bank of microphones an electric expectancy
bill and slim stand next to a seated amy
amelia steps to the microphones
i was a passenger on this journey
just a passenger
everything that was done to bring us across was done by wilmer stultz and slim gordon
all the praise
calls out but you can fly cant you
amelia stares at the man
this flight was solely to the credit of bill and slim
women should know however that i have had hours solo flying and once held the womens altitude record
so you could have done it yourself
this particular flight under these conditions i wonder if anyone but bill stultz could have pulled it off
but certainly one day a woman will do this
as easily as skillfully as professionally as any man
such calm self possession
such confidence in that
aviation is clear today for the pioneer
and if the pioneer has good ideas nobody will ask whether p the pioneer is a man or woman
mostly from women
she looks around the room
i hear your doubt
that doubt is our challenge
this is where our atlantic flight or any other good flight by a woman can help
to them to herself
it starts women thinking
ticker tape parade down broadway crowds lining the streets leaning from windows to welcome amelia home
amelia sits in an open car between bill and slim waving to everyone
in the front seat george and dorothy share the moment
amelia flanked by george and dorothy coming out of a reception hall
amelia glances to george
guess you can burn those letters
i saved them for your book
one simple shake of amelias head
the books yours
the letters are mine
bows in submission
oure the boss
hey thats my job
to amelia do you think theres enough of him to boss for the two of us
amelia still looking at george
barely enough for one
a battery of reporters and flashbulbs wait by our motorcade
miss earhart can you tell us some thing about your future plans
he likes this question
fixes the man with that clear honest gaze
well being a social worker by trade and passion ill be going back to work at denison house when all this fun is over
she sends the guy a smile and a dozen flashes catch it
if i havent been fired
george holds the door of their limo
she looks up to him with a mischievous smile
and with no warning
amelia bypasses the limo climbs into the sidecar of a cops motorcycle and smacks its side
the cop looks up to george who
nods go for it
and the cop does wheeling out into traffic opening up the siren as everyone laughs or cheers or darts into the street desperate for a fleeting photo
george watching her go
dorothy watching george
how did a social worker like miss earhart become comfortable as a celebrity so quickly
his eyes still following amelia
the truth is she was a celebrity on smaller stages all her life
george contd this is just when the rest of us discovered her
watches this too
amelia in a sunlit garden ringed by trees
she sits at a folding table writing longhand
a large dog lies at her feet
so they took me home with them to rye
and i lived there while i wrote my book
pull back to see our view has been georges
he sits at an antique writing desk watching her through a picture window
he rises slowly
we see that he has been reviewing a contract which he takes with him
amelia writing looking up to see george coming down the back porch steps to the garden
i thought hed be a tyrant and that i would have to manage him
he smiles as he approaches
she goes back to work
instead he was kind and generous
and only picked the fights he needed to win
he drops the contract on her table
she looks at it
lucky strike endorsement
i wrote the copy myself
what does it say
i dont smoke but you should
it says lucky strikes were the only cigarettes aboard the friendship
true and misleading
why would i sign that
so bill and slim get paid
his smile simple comfortable
if youre too proud to take tobacco money donate it to byrds expedition and we get great publicity
she stares at him with hard eyes
his smile just becomes more relaxed
an easy win no big deal
she begins to sign the contract
he places a stack of letters in front of her
this weeks marriage proposals
the top ones the most creative
its from sing sing
she starts to read
her eyes widen
in the prison yard so everyone can watch and share in our
looks up did you write the copy on this one too
approaching have you no shame george
no sense of the scandal you create
they look up
she has a tray of lemonade and cookies
you make her work for nothing
at least you can feed her
to amelia are you done yet
if not make him write the rest he will anyway
a womens college
the hall is packed
the lecture and publicity schedule was fierce
i was with her pretty much all the time
amelia and george alone in the wings
this was the moment of opportunity
could we launch her into lindbergh status as a permanent icon before her name fell out of the news papers
he re ties her scarf
checking out the effect
we had separate agendas
for her it was the advancement of aviation and of women
he very slightly rearranges her hair as if every lock matters
as for me i liked to tell myself it was about the money
though there was never much of that left over
she stands for inspection with her trace of a teasing smile
he holds out his hand and she gives him her note cards
really it was about the chance to be around her
he flips through the a cards frowning as he goes
melia george imitation this will never do a
he looks up
she starts pacing around gesturing as he would
amelia george imitation you need more ammunition in these cards and wheres the goddamned humor for chrissake
by which i mean something actually funny
hes trying to look annoyed
it isnt easy
amelia george imitation and please remember not to turn your pretty little backside to the crowd when you use your pointer its your face theyre paying to see
well most of them
she whips around
amelia george imitation and another thing
are a menace
staring at each other
george softly everything about you
is a menace
the stare holds
because this is the moment
i remember the first kiss
it is only one step
her hand goes to his chest
her eyes close as
she brings her mouth to his
tender and strong
it is an act of decision
a held look
no one smiles
we hear her name announced from the podium
but she keeps looking at him
and as the applause continues she finally
strides onto the stage with one graceful wave she brings the applause to a crescendo
of course i knew all the stories hat dorothy had been having a torrid affair with fred upton
she steps to the microphone
the crowd quiets
but i didnt kiss him because i felt sorry for him
or because it would mean the world to him
george in the wings
his heart in his eyes
i did it
because i wanted to
he looks down
hes still holding her cards
an elevator opens and elinor smith a striking young woman emerges
looks at a slip of paper
heads down the hallway to a door
as she gathers herself to knock she looks scared enough to pass out
george answers the door looking gracious and suave
they shake hands
then amelia appears warmly clasping the girls hand and elinor looks as starstruck as a teenager at the oscars
its so good to meet you
ive been following your career with a great deal of admiration
feel like a drink
what would her mother say
i meant a coke
as she leads elinor into the sitting room of their suite the girls eye falls on the door to the bedroom
it is slightly ajar revealing an unmade double bed
unseen by the others the kid reacts
tea in the sitting room
elinor leaning forward guileless eager
theyre saying you get a week on the lecture circuit
on a bad week
on a good week
the girl looks from one to the other
on whether you want the sell or the real
oh i dont underestimate the value of selling
its why im here
a year old girl sets an altitude record then makes headlines illegally flying under the four bridges of the east river
you dont seem to need much help selling yourself
well actually mr
putnam i was hoping you could do to me what youve done to her
inadvertently her eyes flick to the bedroom door
catching this our couple shares a dry smile
the kid sees that
what i mean is
its a good thing
thats why i want it
now our couple is trying not to laugh
just so were clear young lady
what is your primary ambition
elinor straight back to take amelias place as the number one female pilot
the honesty the suddenness leave george atypically dumbstruck
well good for you
i would have expected nothing less
you want a tip
keep doing what youre doing
the girl nods seriously
and dont let anyone turn you around
holiday party in progress
christmas decorations everywhere
a small crowd around the living room bar where george is telling a story
now we see dorothy standing drinking watching george with hard eyes
she turns on her heels and walks out into the garden
george sees this excuses himself follows her as we pan to
amelia standing with a group of guests
shes seen it all
here she comes along the roses still drinking still fuming
a figure comes up behind her
falls in step
lovely party huh
depends on your point of view
ive been listening to some idiot brag about his girlfriend
she never looks at him
well in that case for your information it is a lovely party indeed
anything on your mind
its not so much that my husband is having an affair with his meal ticket
its just a pity we cant have one honest conversation about it
whats wrong with this one
a promising start id say in the honesty department
she finishes her drink
throws the glass away
from our angle we can now see d amelia in the window watching them
if this is what you call an honest talk id say you need some practice
lets try one about you and fred upton
she stops walking
turns in shock to see his easy smile
well im waiting for our practice conversation
hoping ill learn something
she glares at him and storms off
he lets her go
hear a car engine turn over
dorothy peeling out
as he walks back toward the party he now sees amelia in the window
their look holds
george at the kitchen table in dim light
its very late
a hand places a steaming mug of coffee before him
followed by a slice of pie
dorothy and i are through
she sits beside him
for a long long time
its different now
she looks at him
i cant do that
if you give it a chance youll learn to love me
he seems so sunny and strong
what can he be feeling
i already love you
thats why i cant marry you
george a murmur well that explains it
for a minute there i thought you were stuck for an excuse
he comes close enough to kiss
i know me
and you dont
what if i promise not to learn
the day will come
when i will run away
and when it does
he stops her with a kiss
if you love me
ill take my chances
he stares in her troubled eyes
there is no answer
race you to bed
amelia and nearly women lined up in front of planes
waving smiling talking to each other
amelia earhart and a bevy of lovely competitors say hello to the press announcing the first womens air derby racing from santa monica to cleveland
dubbed by will rogers the powder puff derby these gals certainly know how to capture our attention
the next angle shows amelia watching some of her colleagues bouncing playfully on a see saw
she smiles tolerantly but maybe theres a little too much cheesecake for her taste
the crowded waiting room
we close on a young woman we scarcely recognize
it is elinor
though less than a year has passed she seems much older
a secretary leads elinor down the corridor to georges office
as they enter george is pacing on the phone
g eorge into phone because amelia invented the powder puff derby for female pilots
then the men running the damn race suddenly decide every woman has to carry a male navigator and start from east of the rockies so they wont crash into the
george into phone ill tell you why its a front page story
because amelia pulled every woman out of the race
so the organizers had to roll over and give in or theyd have lost their shirts
you want me to write your headline
he glances over
elinor in the doorway
george into phone call you back
ive got a very important guest
he hangs up gesturing graciously for her to sit
as she does
wish i was important enough for you to manage
well ive just got one client
and most days shes more than i can manage
even elinors smile seems older more capable of subtlety
get in line behind the boys she smacked around on the derby
he grins back
some of the gal flyers had their doubts about her
well her skill level
but shes everyones champion now
and both of those things
are the s reasons i called you
he has her attention
i think it would be huge for women flyers if amelia won the derby
the publicity would put the race and all of you up there with the boys
im not sure she has much of a chance mr
well the one shot would be putting her in a far more powerful plane than anything shes flown
were thinking the lockheed vega
the girls shock
he really means this
sir ive test piloted the vega
its way more than she could ever handle
it wouldnt be safe let alone successful
thats why im thinking of you flying with her
you could handle the cross country flying the more difficult bits and id pay you a week
elinor whistles low
well i think thats the most generous opportunity ive ever been offered
he stares at her
theres just one thing
obviously it has to appear that amelia did all the flying
so when pictures are taken youll stand off to one side
her eyes narrow
hes completely serious
in that case ill get my own plane and win the race myself
you havent changed
o smile at all
unfortunately for you neither have i
the look in his eye is not to be ignored
you cant win if you cant get a plane to enter
let me predict that you wont
the voice calm and low and riveting
if you reject my generosity you may come to regret it
for a long long time
thats a threat
im an intensely loyal person elinor
and this is what my loyalty requires
shes the one who said i shouldnt let anybody turn me around
she probably meant me
so honest the words confuse her
obviously she doesnt see me as a threat
oh sure she does
a straight smile
she just doesnt care
which silently fades
is to care for her
sophisticated watering hole
pan to find george alone waiting
a waiter leads amelia to the table
george stands smiling
but the smile is not returned
we close as they sit
melia clearly furious what could be wrong
i had such a lovely afternoon with elinor smith
he told you that i shut her out of the derby
and thats true
and when were you going to tell me
george calm straight never
i knew youd go crazy
and i felt it needed to be done
she can scarcely believe this
you think i wanted it done but just let you do the dirty work
i didnt say that
because im no angel
business is competition and competition is rough and i thank my stars that youre there making this life happen for me but
oure making your life hap
but this is different
if women are going to stab women in the back then women are going nowhere
are you listening
rom here on ill just stab men in he back
a you didnt do this for business anyway
g i did it for fun
you did it because you love me
that stops him
and when were married you mustnt ever
now she stops
because his eyes are wide
whats the big shock
i thought you wanted to get married
his eyes moving over her face
what about what you said
the day s will come when you run away
youll be destroyed
and part of me will too
and i think we both know it
sometimes things happen that way
youre not better safe than sorry
tears stand in his eyes
he is so happy
amelia a whisper contd yes
george a whisper hell yes
through a window a dry wintered garden
snow falling at once soft and heavy
beyond morgan point lighthouse fishers island sound long island sound
one lonely fishing boat braves the cold water
pull back to see
amelia at the breakfast table in a windowed room
she is writing and as she does
her eyes are swimming with tears
she brushes at them
stares down at her work
george his mother the minister a small number of close friends
from the doorway amelia beckons george
the letter is in her hand
amelia holds tight to georges hand leading him out into the falling snow
she turns fixes him with a look
hands him the letter
and steps back
as if giving him space
at first he smiles
what is this
she gestures for him to read
as he begins there is nothing for a few seconds
i want you to understand i shall not hold you to any medieval code of faithfulness to me
nor shall i consider myself bound to you similarly
if we can be honest i think the difficulties which may arise may best be avoided should you or i become interested deeply or in passing with anyone else
she gazes intently her heart in her eyes
he never looks up
please let us not interfere with the others work or play nor let the world see our private joys or disagreements
must exact a cruel promise
and that is you will let me go in a year if we find no happiness together
he stops on this
his thoughts unreadable
i will try to do my best in every way
and give you that part of me you know and seem to want
he folds the letter carefully
places it in his pocket
brutal in her frank ness
beautiful in her honesty
he steps to her
looks in her eyes
the minister reading the vows
the witnesses standing silent
two black cats rubbing against georges ankles
george at the breakfast table
his eggs and toast ignored for the moment hes reading a magazine article
pan to amelia sipping her coffee
george reads aloud why i believe women pilots cant fly the atlantic
an outspoken warning by lady heath
pure suicide for any woman today
it is madness for them to attempt it and
he looks up to her
at least the first dozen will be drowned
and were reading this because
i might fly to paris
which is actually across the atlantic
hence the article
im thinking of doing it solo
would you mind
he butters his toast
not at all
when would you like to go
close on amelia as she kneels carefully putting new plants into the ground
we see patience concentration
after a moment
im surprised youre all right with this
george kneeling beside her
happily planting his own
i was braced for the lecture
five years since lindbergh no ones made it solo so many of them died
he looks at her work
starts packing the earth harder around her plant
she just watches then
ell they were only men
this is different
she reaches to his plant and starts loosening the soil
i was waiting to hear that im only doing this because i was just a passenger last time and id rather die than go on living as a fraud
no one cracks a smile
its like laurel and hardy in a food fight where each lets the other take his best shot
george reaches now starts repacking her soil
but you dont think that do you ear
of course not
but if i did
she smacks his hand
he just keeps working
she finally grins smacks him harder
he doesnt seem to notice
all the more reason to say yes
in the suns last light two figures walk slowly far below us
the vega waits
they stand beneath the wing
her ground crew in far distance giving them their moment
her look is not breezy and cavalier this time but tender and intimate
she knows the fear beneath his easy smile
he produces a ring a band of black fibers
elephant hair i think you wear it on your toe
its good luck
he puts it in her hand
thats what the elephant told me
amelia looks at the ring
turns it in her fingers
i think luck has rules
and i try to respect them
my favorite is
she glances up
we make our own luck you and i
he will remember that
do you have money
he pulls out a twenty dollar bill
hands it to her
thank god i thought you were going to tear it in half
i spent our money on ocean liner passage to go bring you back
its non refundable
so try to do your part
he doesnt want to leave her yet
so the simpkin thing
what was all that
i put it in a letter
which youll get if i dont make it
mixed emotions huh
he shakes his head
george very soft either way something to look forward to
she puts her hands on his face
she doesnt want to leave him either
amelia murmurs stake up the peonies huh
theyre messy when they bloom on the ground and
amelia a whisper i want to see their heads high
when i come home
she leans up to kiss him
feeling in her eyes that he will never forget
feet below are icebergs
a single fishing boat
the weather report wasnt perfect
but we knew our real chance was to take weather that others wouldnt
ahead towering clouds in moonlight
too high to fly over
i closed the deal by choosing may five years to the day from lindberghs flight
it was too good a sell for george to resist
what we didnt know
a terrifying storm batters the plane which bobs and darts and dips like a leaf in a gale
was that my altimeter would conk out
never to return
amelia fights for control as the plane is tossed and shaken
the only way to have any sense of altitude was to keep dropping toward the sea
amelia contd when the engines sputtered that was my low level limit
a sudden jolt knocks her out of her seat
she scrambles back as we see whitecaps a few feet below
she jerks the nose up the engine coughs
i was too busy to grasp how impossible the situation had become
the joke was
flying in and out of cloud cover
all those months flying only with instruments i should have been practicing without them
pan to the windshield
a small glow at the surface of a vibrating engine
amelia hasnt noticed
i started to wonder if luck was paying me back
for thinking i knew the rules
a small blue flame licks out into the night
then i smelled burning oil
she sees it now
the flame coming through a broken weld in the manifold ring
a a bad weld already a small flame
it would be hours back to canada trying to find an unlit field landing with a heavy fuel load
she stares at the little flame
is it growing bigger
i told myself push on
after all if it was a stupid choice
flying in blackness
rising as the engines seem sluggish
no one would ever know
suddenly a film of slush on the windscreen
with seemingly no warning there was ice
the controls froze
and the vega dives into a dizzying spin
through the spin i had one thought it would be warmer lower the ice would melt i just had to regain control
the spinning plane plunging
before i hit the water
and arcing at last to swoop above the whitecaps
way close for comfort
smash cut to
amelia reeling in her seat her fingers fumbling in her flight bag for
or passed out
smelling salts she inhales again blinks starts to climb
the ice happened twice more and i began to lose heart
then i remembered lindberghs book saying the same thing happened to him
he sea disappears below
so i figured if hes twice as good i just have to be twice as lucky
amelia seriously fatigued
she breaks through cloud into dazzling sunlight and blinks blinded
id read that part in georges reception room that first day
bless him for keeping me waiting
the fuel gauge reads empty
she switches on the reserve tank
and as she drops back down into opaque clouds
she feels something
her fingertips go to her left shoulder and come away
the cockpit gauge was defective
there was a steady trickle of fuel down my neck
she looks around helplessly for a way to stem the dripping
toss up whether the bigger danger was running out of gas or going up in a fireball
i had my answer in less than an hour when
amelia beyond exhaustion
staring fixedly at some thing we cant see
until we pan through the wind screen to the leak in the manifold weld
the blue flame is startlingly larger now licking its way along the surface of the fuselage
the manifold weld began to separate
i gauged the likelihood of explosion at somewhere between probable and inevitable
arms folded george stares out his window
he hasnt slept or eaten
pan to his desk
the phone is off the hook
the door opens softly
he turns and looks at her
the girls eyes go down and he bolts to the phone snatches the receiver slams the button
george into phone putnam
a full beat
sir this is douglas mcguire of the press association
im sorry to tell you that miss earharts plane has crashed in a field short of le bourget airport
a plane swooping downward through cloud and fog
the sound of georges call continues
is she all right
if the crash is as reported sir im afraid not
there were terrible flames
lower its dropping fast maybe too fast wobbles in a crosswind here comes the ground and
are they completely sure its her plane
yes sir absolutely
the vega rights itself and glides in for as fine a landing as a bumpy meadow could allow
cows look up as she rolls past toward
one lone astonished farm worker
she cuts her engines leans from the hatch
excuse me sir
where am i
in gallaghers pasture
ne more beat
where are ya supposed to be
when i left i was aiming for paris
man very sad ya missed yknow
its over there
movietone newsreel footage of amelia arriving at new york harbor to an overwhelming reception
amelia earhart arrives to a tumul tuous new york reception after her whirlwind tour of europe in which our queen of the skies danced with her royal counterpart the prince
of wales before meeting both benito mussolini and the pope
the mayor the governor every dignitary that could get an invitation is there to greet her
the second human to fly the atlantic solo she is the only one ever to fly it twice
and she set the record man or woman for the fastest crossing
fourteen hours minutes
as she waves to the crowd
now its americas turn to show our girl what we think of her
we are standing in the wings
through the curtains we glimpse the eager packed house in an auditorium
from the stage a speaker drones but backstage
george peeks out at the throng
when he looks back we see amelia her troubled face
the folded newspaper in her hand
amelia reads only an average flyer she has pushed herself to the front by following the tactics of the feminists
she looks up to him
ell im glad someone besides me finally noticed
his smile is light
her eyes watching him
amelia reads using a man made perfect machine tuned by men mechanics trained by men flyers on a course laid out by a man
by a lucky break she just managed to make the hop
she stares at the paper
his voice comes gently
hy would you even read that garbage
well it reminds me how much i owe to the men of this world
keeps me humble
and remembering how little you owe me keeps me humble
hes a crackpot
let it go
he points to the packed hall
theyre crazy about you
amelia quiet well theyre crazy about something
she looks down
self doubt flickers
what have we really done
youve made them feel like this
thats not enough
most of them are women
and for them its very much enough
she shakes her head
the world telegram said a magnificent display of useless courage
the question is
can any magnif icent display of courage be use less
a the point is
men do it every day
and no one throws a parade
one day closer then
to the day when they wont think to throw one for you
she doesnt turn
she doesnt smile
reasoning with me
a magnificent display of useless courage
he nods to himself
from the stage
hail to the chief strikes up
we hear the deep applause
george begins to straighten amelias outfit touching her hair as he did long ago on the copley hotel roof
george murmurs close to her ear
if a bomb goes off tonight the whole government of the united states is out there
some dog catcher will have to become president
just for him
george a whisper boy
imagine if youd actually done something
amelia a whisper imagine
shes through the curtain and the crowd crackles with applause as
george stands in the wings
a train rumbles through countryside
a private compartment finds amelia staring out the window
george studying her
the irony is id finally put that wedding day letter out of my mind
stopped watching every beautiful accomplished man who crossed her path
through the glass of our compartment door a crowd stands jouncing against each other
gazing at their queen of the skies
i had a call from the byrds
theyve asked us to dinner thursday
thursday ill be in boston
meeting gene vidal and paul collins
not even looking at him
while through the glass its become quite a tussle
dont tell me gene wants to resurrect transcontinental
no hes starting a shuttle service
washington new york boston
one woman goes flying from view as a younger one gets her place
could be a money maker for us
get me off the lecture grind
he stares in her eyes
almost as if looking for something
genes a dashing guy
he could talk anyone into anything
their look holds
ounds like a great idea
pan the dark elegant restaurant
in a corner by the fire place amelia and her dinner companions are being served lobsters
gene vidal leans to amelia as he speaks and she hangs on every word
transcontinental was too ambitious
too many hops too tough on the ladies
but the shuttle
a lean athletes body easy grace in every movement
strikingly handsome features that convey not only intellect but kindness and decency
washington new york boston
i think its the future
will you go there with us
shes trying to crack her lobster but cant take her eyes off her host
what on earth would you need me for
shes making a real mess of the lobster
paul collins doesnt
hasnt george taught you anything
lady lindy the queen of the air the best known woman in the entire u
gene reaches over as if it were his own plate and begins cracking her lobster for her
she looks in his eyes and tries to concentrate
gene on the poster with you
legendary athlete at west point two events in the olympics a top pilot who should be running the skies for roosevelt when he wins
gene looks up at paul as if to say enough
now he smiles at amelia
she blinks what
dont you want your lobster
she starts eating
ene looking only at amelia thanks paul
i think youve even talked me out of it
paul has gone
gene and amelia are at the bar huddled over his beer and her coke
gene had a terrible marriage and was separated from his alcoholic adulterous wife
but he was too kind to humiliate her with a divorce
gene drains the last of his beer
as a result he was basically a single parent to their young son gore
he glances at his watch
im rattling on here and youve got a morning train
but shes just staring in his eyes
this could be her last chance to ask
hows nina doing
he smiles gently
actually she hasnt been feeling her best
shell probably summer in newport
so my kids stuck with dad again
if you two get bored i could tag along sometimes
you suggesting youre less boring than i am
he smiles first
hers is slower but here it comes
any given meal i can eat a lobster and have you boys in stitches
a full beat
gore would love that
he has a little crush im afraid
he breaks the look
fishes out some cash for the bar tab
g listen paul and i would be thrilled to rope you into our shuttle
are you kidding its a godsend
no matter how hard george and i work how many lectures we cram in theres never enough money for the next adventure
he looks at her
lets the silence sit there
his eyes seem to convey a depth of understanding
the next adventure
what is it
because were running out of oceans
wish youd do something about that
im serious amelia
her soft smile
the only way you can stay where you are
and be who you are
is to keep feeding the beast
she cant smile anymore
because this is the very fear she lives with
and the beast always needs something larger greater more daring
amelia quiet he costs money too
the price of fame literally
do you and george talk about this
we dont have to
with all respect
yes you do
walking together down the hallway of her hotel
no one speaks
their thoughts are their own
she reaches her room finds her key
opens the door and
turns to him
a brief direct look
she reaches one hand gently behind his head
isses his mouth
amelia a whisper thank you
his eyes question
there is no smile
without a word she goes into her room
closes the door behind her
e stands alone
do i knock on that door
then smiles to himself and simply
crowded hall each table ringed by diners in formal dress
at a table of honor george sits next to elinor smith chatting comfortably
pan to the head table
after roosevelt won his wife eleanor brought the advancement of women to national attention with stunning success
close on eleanor roosevelt eating heartily chatting laughing with a companion we dont see until
a gutsy gal who rode a bobsled in he winter olympics spent hours each morning on horseback and carried a pistol on car trips
she possessed boundless energy a towering intellect
we reveal amelia in a formal satin dress at her side dishing with the first lady like the closest of girlfriends
and was amelias idol
as it happened she was obsessed with flying making amelia her absolute heroine
a so he hasnt actually forbidden you
franklin doesnt forbid
he just feels its a waste of my valuable ime to learn
since i cant afford to buy a plane
they share a look of such mutual understanding neither has to smile
the wrong roosevelt got elected
and it will take at least four years to correct the mistake
i did ask about aviation but he hasnt decided on the structure yet
it might be under the bureau f commerce
i think the structure may be less important than the man chosen to run it
said casually looking at her plate
my hearing is failing
i missed the words or woman which you undoubtedly added after or per haps before the word man
his could be one of those rare instances
when the most accomplished candidate
turns out to be male
glances up for the reaction
i love finding the exception that proves the rule
is t a name i know
amelias straight gaze
her small smile
how do you feel about flying at night
eleanors eyes register the change of topic
rolling with it
ive never done it
franklin finds t dangerous
raucous party in the small cabin hosted by george and fueled by champagne
pan slowly to
amelia at the controls in her evening dress and formal gloves
eleanor in the co pilots seat awestruck by the brilliant starry night
amelia glances over moved by her friends almost childlike wonder
amelia softly put your hands on the wheel
eleanor looks over
are you serious
its dual controls
no one will ever know
dont you trust me
and slowly eleanors fingers close on her wheel
amelias hands come away from hers
the condor purrs along through the night air
the moon bobs slightly off to one side
eleanors eyes are swimming with the thrill of this
i feel like a coke
can i get you something
and stands up
only the trace of her smile as the pilots eyes widen in absolute shock
do try not to hit the ground
a sea of press quiet poised attentive
reverse angle to
close on a seated roosevelt before a bank of microphones
today we proudly announce an appointment critical to americas commerce and to its role as technologys leader in the twentieth century
pan to gene at his side
ene vidal is an obvious and perfect choice as our first director of commerces aeronautics branch
his extraordinary credentials include
a taxi slowly pulls up to the home we know
warmly lit music playing from within
gene climbs from the cab as yard lights go on
as gene starts up the path the front door opens and amelia bursts into the night running to gene jumping into his arms hugging him in her delight
we pull back to
george watching it all from the doorway
his easy smile seems comfortably in place as
amelia walks gene up the path her arm around his waist talking excitedly flushed as a schoolgirl
as they reach the door
george is the picture of calm and dignity
he beams and clasps genes hand
throws an arm around his shoulder as amelia leads them inside
the door closes
we hear laughter
amelia on her knees tending to her garden
she seems happy and filled with energy
george comes and kneels beside her
have i told you what a perfect job ou did on the peonies
george working you have actually
its all right
youve been distracted lately
no spin on that
if g anything the tone is kind
listen ive put together a month n europe
close some foreign licensing deals open new markets
she doesnt look up
when are you leaving
id like you to come
she stiffens only slightly
can he sense it
i dont really see how i can
ive talked to the promoters theyll switch some lecture dates for us
now hes looking at her profile
saddened if not surprised by what he sees
well its not just that
theres y work on the shuttle were at a critical stage and
ive just started as genes consultant at the aeronautics branch
she knows hes watching
shakes her head
keeps on working
normally id be worried about leaving you here alone
but i suppose that wont be a problem will it
she stops now
looks up at him
if he wants a direct conversation he can have it
what are you trying to say
i think ive just said it
a long held look
neither backing away
sadness on both sides
george softly is there anything you want to say
her fingers reach out rub his hand with affection
i cant think of anything helpful
walks back toward the house his garden tools forgotten
she stares after him
e disappears into the house
shes still staring
movietone newsreel footage introduced by its theme
a stadium in brilliant sunlight filled with more than people
los angeles california
the tenth olympics of the modern era kick off as movie stars mingle with ordinary joes
on the track women run the meter high hurdles as every throat cheers
heres the gold medal run of the worlds best woman athlete abe didrickson
cheered on by the most celebrated woman of today
tight insert of amelia with gene and year old gore all applauding excitedly
thats right amelia earhart
hollywood glamor american winners and wait til our boys warm up for their action
the camera lingers as amelia says something to gore
they look like a family
close on george alone in his office
he goes to the door locks it
his face is drawn grim
by this time i had a side job as chairman of the editorial board of paramount pictures
so amelia and i bought a little place in los angeles
he goes slowly back to his desk
on it sits a large cardboard carton
she was out there preparing for a flight when our home in rye burned to the ground
we see that the contents of the box papers small objects have been singed or charred
he stares into it
we both cried when i called to tell her
she asked to come be with me
but i insisted she stay there to keep on schedule for her flight
he reaches into the box
so many treasures lost
letters and poems shed written
i poured through the rubble
amelia curled up on the sofa of a cozy pleasant little home
the doors are open to the patio and yard
winter is different here
tropical flowers fruit trees in bloom
the phone rings and she picks it up quickly knowing its george
amelia softly hi
whats today been like
you still okay
intercut george at his office
hes standing at the window phone in one hand single sheet of paper in the other
like the other objects in the box it is partially singed
i found something youd written
draws a breath
eorge reading to touch your hand or see your face today is joy
your casual presence in a room recalls the stars that watched us as we lay
back to amelia
tears fill her eyes
george reading i mark you in the moving crowd and see again those stars a warm night lent us long ago
we loved so then
we love so now
his eyes are dry
thank you for writing that
his voice still softer
even though id never seen it
hold on him
the pain of what that must mean
her lips are parted
shes searching for words
i suppose i thought
it was too revealing
gene enters the room with a drink in his hand and sits down next to her concerned by her obvious distress
amelia into the phone im so glad you have it now
amelia contd of course
ill call you later
she hangs up slowly
the tears begin to fall
she looks at gene helplessly
then stands without a word
walks out into the yard
spectators at newark airport
a plane circles the field as flood lights flash on and the crowd begins to cheer
arcing in now for a landing
the odyssey began in honolulu when he became the first person man or woman to fly solo over half the pacific to california
touching down the cheering crowd held back by police
as amelia taxies to a stop the crowd breaks through police lines and surges toward the plane
then the first human to solo from california to mexico city
followed by her daring solo across the gulf
as she passed over washington d
she eclipsed the time of a certain previous flight from hours to hours
amelia hops down from the plane grinning and waving
she is surrounded by adoring fans
the pilot of that previous flight
some guy named lindbergh
the jostling of the crowd gets out of control the police cant protect her as she is swept along by the mob beaming laughing enjoying it all
dark little piano bar
they sit in a quiet corner com fortable in silence
gene with his martini amelia with her coke
shes shelling peanuts from a bowl popping some in her mouth passing a few over to him
if you dont drink why do you come o bars
must be the ambience
and the nuts
what worries me is in some of these bars the nuts are the ambience
specially when they make a pass at you
he chews staring at him
any guy would have to be nuts to do that
im considerable trouble if you havent noticed
you keep advertising that but im still waiting to see it
she looks down at her fingers as they shell
youll see it
well heres your chance
im taking gore to the conference in bermuda
he wants you to come
im completely indifferent
would make life simpler
she throws a peanut which boinks off his face
he smiles a suddenly goofy very non elegant smile
actually ill be in indiana
edward elliot of purdue wants
amelia contd me to build a womens careers department there
he likes that
ill be back and forth
when im there ive asked to stay in the dorm with the girls
thats a wonderful idea
something in the way he said that
whats special about now
a good time for some positive press about you as a role model
her eyes harden
whatever do you mean
you dont read the papers
not unless someone makes me
well someone should
because theyre all saying you took recklessly dangerous solo flights for no earthly purpose except publicity
g they also harp on a growing list of products that you commercially endorse
how thoughtless of me to be doing ll this in a society where no one else is interested in making money
present company included
hes not afraid of her
look george had you taking money rom the sugar cartel for the hawaii flight the mexican government for theirs hes selling commemorative stamps which you carried on the flights
if this is about george just say o
because we made those calls nd we includes me
im sorry i said it that way
this s actually about you because im picking a fight apparently a useless one for the benefit of someone i care about
and whats your point
women are eld to some higher standard
bankers and industrialists are ad mired for succeeding but women are just considered selfish and grasping
ene quietly of course they are
well lets change that shall we
r would you just prefer to adopt t since groveling would be easier
staring at each other
if you want to make money my guess s that people viewing you as lady lindy americas sweetheart of the skies the wife mother daughter they all wished they had
would be helpful
thanks for the tip
thanks for not being defensive
well im an open minded girl
and o prove it im hereby resigning as your consultant at the s aeronautics branch
he throws some money on the table for the drinks
the public linking of our names does more harm to that image of mine than everything else put together
she stands up
next time you read the papers
try reading between the lines
gene makes no move to follow
hes said his piece
movietone newsreel footage introduced by its theme
against a backdrop of flowerbeds amelia is flanked by four women with conservative hats and middle aged gravitas
the photographers edge closer
i came to washington today with the national womens party to ask the president for his aid in passing the lucretia mott amendment for equal rights
she waits for the press to quiet
and thats because i havent needed it
the winsome smile
im the lucky one
our department of commerce shows no prejudice in issuing licenses to fly
a pilot is a pilot
and now it fades
how about giving the rest of our women
the ones who can be productive for their families and for our nation an equal break
she is not defiant
gentle and strong
they are your sisters and your daughters
they are your wives
the smallest shake of her head
youve no excuse
and you know it
o eds gathered in the common room in robes and nightgowns
they fill the old couches the mismatched easy chairs curl up in blankets on the floor
amelia in flannel pajamas sitting on the grand piano pointing to the next question among the many raised hands
okay its all well and good to tell us to study whatever we want and work at whatever we want and not give a darn about what the world of
including them wanting us to say darn instead of damn
the girl flushes a little her point is a crucial one
but what about those of us who are getting married when we graduate
what advice do you have for us
she meant that
and no one is laughing now
build your career first
and surprisingly thats the best thing you can do for your eventual marriage
so many eager faces so many disturbed ones
it starts with a strong sexual attraction that the oman assumes must be love
some heads are nodding
some eyes suspicious
everything works until the first financial crisis jars the mans confidence and threatens the omans security
she looks from one to the next
because she cant help
all she can be is dependent
because that s what shes been trained to be
a phone rings
one of the girls snatches it up to cut off the interruption
co ed hushed common room
hand over phone to he says hes the man in your life
amelia hops off the piano
there are plenty of curious faces
only a husband talks like that
in their laughter she goes to the phone
everybody hangs on every word of
amelia into the phone yes
hand over phone to the they love when we say yes
im flying in tuesday
yes of course ill make time
thanks for the roses
she hangs up
turns to her adoring pupils and drops a curtsy
she stares at them
as if deciding whether to say
can you women keep a secret
and boy do they want to hear one
well its no secret that im a bit driven some might say obsessive about my little flying adven tures
they are nodding wide eyed go on
ive decided to embark on easily the most exciting possibly cra ziest ever
they hold their breath
im going to fly
around the world
a frozen beat for them to even absorb this
they burst into wild applause amelia beaming as we dissolve to
amelia and george bundled against the cold walking park avenue hand in hand
christmas decorations bright lights
a good mood prevails
are you going to tell me your surprise or do i have to get physical
boy that is the last thing id want
i only thought that if youre serious about this around the world nonsense
it might be handy to have a plane to fly in
except it would have to be an electra and they cost
after a generous discount from lockheed
may as well be a billion
not to mention at least another to get it modified and ready
she glances at him
he looks awfully smug
and your surprise is you robbed a bank
what on earth
ive sort of persuaded ed elliot to create an amelia earhart fund for aeronautical research at purdue
and suggested a budget item of
oh eighty grand
for a suitable flying laboratory
her eyes just bug out
he nods slowly
throws her arms around his neck kissing him hard enough to startle passersby
it only makes him chuckle
as i said ive sort of persuaded ed
there are a bunch of trustees and donors tho
we have to get them on board
think i could help
he looks in her eyes
by the way
thats not the surprise
and he glances to
the window of the gallery theyve stopped at
she sees a magnificently carved chest
on a crest in the front ae
we pan the surface to see planes oceans a shamrock for the londonderry landing dozens more symbols of her triumphs and in a bottom corner looking up at all of
this in wonder
a small cat
in a long frock coat
george a whisper merry christmas
her tears just come
shes standing on park avenue and she cant do anything about it
he reaches a tender hand
and strokes her hair
he is her hero
see it in her eyes
cant wait to see what you got me
a whole case
amelia at her writing desk
she begins to write
president some time ago i told you and mrs
roosevelt about my confidential plans for a world flight
the chief problem is the jump westward from honolulu
s she writes dissolve to
a glittering table surrounded by high rollers
george and president elliot sit on either side of amelia who has risen to speak
as president elliot has said it would be a shining adventure beckoning with new experiences
making me more useful to the program here at purdue
she looks into the eyes of each in turn
it is much more
i believe that women should do for themselves what men have done and occasionally what men have not
this might encourage other women toward greater independence of thought and action
and i know how deeply you gentlemen desire that
there is gentle laughter
amelia reacts in mock surprise
i know of course from my chats earlier in the evening
with each of your wives
applause from a wife then the others then all
in that spirit i want each of you to reach for your checkbooks
she regards their amusement
and losing none of the warmth of her own smile
i mean that quite literally
this is an opportunity for me to exhibit the quality my husband admires most
eorge and amelia gaze at each other
to be relentless
the lockheed electra a sleek state of the art aircraft with its gleaming metallic surface nose up in the center of a huge space
its engines are on hoists being worked on by a team of mechanics
eight year old gore gazes up as if he has never seen anything quite so wondrous
amelia and gene watch with barely suppressed smiles
hes in a suit
shes in grease stained overalls from working with the mechanics
so youd be the first one right
ou always like that
to fly around the world
well theres magellan years go
actually he didnt make it
and he died
and he used a boat
so its almost the same except its completely different
he glowers at her
she glowers back
there are men who say they flew around the world but they didnt ly around all of it
because at higher latitudes its short trip
at the north pole ou just spin in a circle and youve gone around the world
so why are you asking
just to show how smart you are
now hes grinning
she just glowers harder
the only way to really fly around he world is to fly the entire circumference of miles
like at the equator
no ones tried it
you think i should
is she serious
she seems to be
ask her about the pacific
the maximum range of the electra is miles
and the closest land est of honolulu is farther than that
gore looks to her
ill have to refuel
in the air
one plane to another
the boy is staring at her now
youre really going to do all this arent you
well dont you think i can
i guess well find out
hold on gene
he smiles at his kid
go out to the car and get sara
ask if shell take you for an ice cream
the boy knows hes being dismissed
looks from his dad to amelia who steps forward to give him a hug and a kiss
well play some cards before you leave
one more glance at dad and gore goes
gene gestures for amelia to come with him away from the mechanics
but hes already walking to
a little folding table off in a corner
g you cant refuel in the air
just like that
s that an opinion or an order
his rueful smile
the only good thing about losing our former relationship is i feel a little freer to tell you when youre being completely crazy
oh i bet there are more advantages than just that
no ones backing down on this
youre not a good enough pilot to o mid air refueling
you will not be able to control the electra or that docking maneuver for that amount of time
ive taken bigger risks
dont be so proud of it
he reaches into a pocket
pulls out a folded sheet of paper
it opens to reveal a map of the pacific
a dot is circled in red
this is howland island
its half way between honolulu and new guinea
it has no elevation no trees its a mile wide and a mile and a half long
hardly anyone knows or cares that it exists
its your vacation home
were colonizing it because when the japanese make their move were going to need a refueling strip there
try reading the newspapers between he lines
we havent started building the runways yet
maybe if someone i knew could get the presidents attention
she stares at the map
its really tiny a grain of sand n the middle of a thousand miles f nowhere
her eyes are clicking through a calculus of their own
youd need a first class navigator or that leg
which means the trip cant be entirely solo
can you handle that
he waits without saying a word
amelia softly back dont rush me
a coast guard station overlooking the pacific
a lone woman leans on a railing
from the station a man emerges he has
a thermos and two large mugs
he pours steaming coffee into each and brings them to the woman at the rail
she has turned to study him as he approaches
its good to meet you
she holds out her hand
he juggles the mugs so he can shake it
strong look in each others eyes
hands her a mug
i hear you like your coffee black
this time of day i like it with bacon and eggs
his slight grin
a handsome guy
be right back
over easy on the eggs
your job could depend on it
silence between them
are we sizing me up
and of course this is exactly what shes doing
im told that mid air refueling would be beyond my abilities
maybe maybe not
you dont get he fuel so youre cooked anyway
better odds of hitting that island
how do you feel about
watching his eyes as he says that
even with cloud cover
ive crossed the pacific by air times
pan am told you im the best celestial navigator theyve ever seen
someone else told you i have a drinking problem
which is a big art of why were here yes
pan am will tell you
everyone i ver worked for will tell you
nothings interfered with my performance
my dad drank
he lied all the time
rest his soul
you trusted bill stultz
that worked out
rest his soul
bill just had to find europe
were looking for something less than two miles long with nothing higher on it than feet
he shakes his head
thats what youre looking for
im looking for coordinates on a map
and if it doesnt work
he spreads his large hands
money back guarantee
she holds the look
amelia softly hey
how can i lose
amelia at a bank of microphones smiling modest comfortable
george and fred stand back to one side
flashbulbs go crazy newsreel cameras churn
did i pressure the navy to build a landing strip at howland island
how exactly would i do that
l threaten not to enlist
aughter in the room
the airstrip has been planned for a long time
i was thrilled to learn it will be ready in time for my flight
the navy has been wonderful as always
amelia what do you say to the charges that your husband is pulling the strings pressuring you nto this around the world flight o make a financial killing
george bolts forward to the microphones looks at his wife with astonishment
wait a minute youre flying around the world
dont you know a womans place is in the home
the press roars with laughter
george why dont you go along this time
watch over the little woman
i begged to go
but it seems that between pounds of husband and pounds of fuel i lost out
gazes at his wife
at least i think thats what all he laughter meant
he gives her a kiss
thirty flashes record it
as he steps back
experts are saying that this flying laboratory is a sham
theres nothing to be learned for aviation and youre just in this for the money
the place gets really quiet
who am i to argue with experts
ill just give you my plain old common sense thinking on this
pens come up cameras jockey for position
this is what theyre waiting for
she holds up one finger
we may not learn much about the plane but we will about the pilot
endurance over a months journey flying nearly every day
response o stress crises
i think that will make a contribution
holds up a second finger
im a working stiff like all of you
i dont apologize for the fact that i need money to live
and to keep financing my flying which is what i love
i think thats a positive example for women
im not doing this as a scientist
im a flyer boys pursuing my passion
for the fun of it
the fun of it
something i recommend as a healthy motive for women
and maybe even some men
the electra ready to go in first light engines humming
amelia walking alone toward the plane
he waves goodbye to crew and press
climbs the steps to be welcomed by freds hand gently pulling her aboard
the door closes
we see amelia and fred in the cockpit
he checks a gauge
weve got so much fuel we cant possibly get off the ground
much safer than flying
well we need enough for a third pass at howland
after you miss it the first couple times around
he runway lights go on and
we were all of us fearful about hat landing
no one guessed
amelia roars off gathering speed
it would be the take off
the electra suddenly veers to the right and we smash cut amelia throttling down the left engine
the plane swinging wildly to the left as
the right wheel collapses the plane spins to the left and we intercut between the cockpit and the runway as the electra
careens madly for a thousand feet amelia cutting the switches to the engines fighting for control propellers smashed by the concrete runway sparks flying in every intercut
george and his retinue waiting
a phone ringing
someone takes the call his face freezes he looks wildly around to
george whos there snatching the receiver
have you heard
they crashed the ships in flames
smash cut to the cockpit the electra spinning crazily on its belly sparks everywhere the plane suddenly comes
to a bone jarring stop
the right motor is pushed up into its wing which itself has buckled the stabilizer bent the left wing extends upward from scraping the runway the landing gear no longer
sirens scream as fire trucks and ambulances race toward them
amelia is ashen disbelieving
next to her a gentle
good reaction cutting the switch
you saved our ass
she doesnt even hear throwing open the cockpit waving to signal theyre all right we smash cut to
george wandering numbly on the airfield as someone runs like crazy from the office shouting
george alone on the tarmac
stops in his tracks
now he can cry
two figures in a garden walking in light so spare they are silhouettes
her head is down
his hands are in his pockets
we close on them as she fingers a blossom we now see she is miserable fighting absolute despair
three weeks shell be good as new
its a remarkable crew
the best hat
realizing where he was going
she never looks up
the best that money can buy
i just cant believe ive done this o us
all the money wasted thats never coming back
you cut the engines
it would have cost a bundle more to replace a burned up plane
not to mention pilot
she shakes her head
the plane was too heavy i should have used the rudder pedal instead of the throttle
tears stand in her eyes
she is so ashamed and remorseful
he lets it stay silent as they walk
ts only money well figure it out
we always do
ill make it back and more i promise
the book sales the lectures this flight will keep us going another three years
no it will
our prices our sales are going to double
amelia contd this showed them how dangerous it all is they were taking it for granted
they thought i was competent
george softly i meant
or maybe we can quit
she looks over
not sure if
you mean after
a strong smile
so my exit would be a stupid crash
nd withdrawing from a world publicized attempt to finally do something no man had done before
and it would be fine ith me
her eyes overwhelmed a his offer
by her voice soft with
but thats because youre an idiot
lucky for you
a held beat
and what if its not something i have to show the world
what if its something i have to show me
he has no answer for that
takes her hand
they head toward the house
massive enclosed space
the rebuilt electra in pieces at various work stations being perfected by teams of mechanics
the whirr and clang of tools
amelia and george confer with one foreman as george sees something
he touches her arm points in our direction
reverse angle as she sees
gene has entered the hangar
stands by the folding table weve seen before
who let you off the hook on this
she takes his hand firmly and together they cross the hangar toward gene
he smiles unfolds a third chair
as they arrive amelia steps forward
kisses gene on the cheek
george shakes his hand
thanks for letting me come
as they sit gene looks from one to the other
i guess im already outvoted
shed outvote you all by herself
he does it to me every day
genes smile cant mask the concern in his eyes
i dont have a choice
i have to reverse my route and fly east
if go west now im risking hurricanes in the caribbean and monsoons in africa
but youre flying howland last when youre exhausted
she knows this
in the silence
gene this way our first leg is oakland to miami
its a shakedown o make sure the plane is right
gene nods slowly
his eyes still locked on her
maybe im obsessing on howland because it was my bright idea and id feel responsible if
well if i do pop off ill try to make it somewhere thats not your fault
id appreciate that
draws a breath
you miss that island
youll be out of fuel with miles to go
but ill have fred so i wont miss
in fact im taking fred along for this whole trip
surprisingly he doesnt seem to like this
giving up my little arrogance about solo
safety first yes
but hes still unhappy
she waits for him to say
you and fred alone for a month
if youre worried about his drinking ill deal with it
i can handle fred
and now we get a sense of exactly what does worry him
he glances to george
how do you feel
every little girl needs a man around
even strong girls like ours hmmn
a very direct gaze
words neither said nor needed
she can handle us
she can handle fred
a full beat
the look holds between the men
and thanks for being here
youve always had amelias best interests t heart
he look still unbroken
and for that
amelia and george crossing the tarmac from the electra waving to the crowd
the legendary amelia earhart lands in miami completing the first and easiest leg of her around the world equatorial flight
a feat no man has ever attempted
thats hubby george with her he gets off here
behind them coat slung casually across his shoulder is fred
waving like he belongs
that handsome guy behind them isnt a movie star
nope its navigator fred noonan who will be amelias sole companion on the exotic odyssey
close on the rugged smile
hey where does a guy go to apply for a job like that
the pastel sky has darkened along the row of legendary hotels
at first we can barely find them at the waters edge
close to see her sitting where the surf cant quite reach her toes
hes lying back hands cradling his head
watching the stars come out
ill be flying sky no ones ever been in
you made that happen
she looks down to his easy smile
hate to think where youd be without me
she smiles back
tenderness we dont always see
ill try to make you proud
you did that long long ago
only ne person left to prove yourself o
just make sure you do it
the doubt comes
and then what
then the best part
she stares in his eyes
leans to him
amelia a whisper oh yeh
she brings her hands to his face
her mouth to his
her body sinks into him
only each other
from the open door of a hangar we see amelia and george facing reporters in front of the idling electra
she sits on the wing hes just beneath her
the radio problems crept up on us ver time
the marine kilocycle radio was left in oakland
amelia said she
george contd and fred were both amateurs at morse code so the radio wasnt worth what it weighed
amelia has made the boys laugh
george laughs with them
the foot trailing auxiliary antenna she would leave behind in miami
too heavy not important
and plenty of them
she reaches down to take georges hand and hops down from the wing
then suddenly our remaining radio ouldnt reach its designated frequencies
pan am hurriedly replaced the main antennae
and we thought all was well
amelia and george coming toward us now hand in hand leaving the press behind
in shadow here
the world far away she takes his hands
race you to california
ill go west
if youll fly the plane
make it twenty
simpkin keeps many mice at one time
each under a different teacup
hes finally going to hear this
were saying hes cruel
the light begins to dawn
he needs the illusion of activity o feel comfortable
that hes preparing for all contingencies
george has to grin
that he has more irons in the ire than anyone knows
especially the mice
each poor mouse thinks its all about her
staring at each other
and one of them
amelia a murmur she knows
want you to give me something
hes never sounded quite like this before
tell me this is your last flight
her eyes flicker
and when the eyes come up
dont you know i couldnt
even if part of me wanted to
very very much
the look holds
how can we be anything
but what we are
there is no answer
she leans up into a slow kiss
i do love you
something in her serious face makes him smile
well i love you back
takes a step back toward the hangar door
one hand slightly up stay here
then the smile hes waited for
he smiles back
she turns and heads out toward the idling plane
she seems small even fragile alone on the tarmac
stay with george
watching her go
view down onto an endless sea of triple canopy rainforest
view of brazilian city from above
view onto the ocean and african coast
view of animals running beneath us
view of the saharas sands children surrounding amelia at an african airfield amelia sleeping in the open desert being welcomed by turbaned dignitaries amelia on a camel suddenly kicks it
into a gallop
its red line tracing our journey from miami to san juan to venezuela to brazil the red line moving across the atlantic to french west africa and north to the
sudan the red line moves from the nile river across the tip of arabian peninsula through persia afghanistan and finally to calcutta
headlines from various installments of her daily article in the herald tribune with her byline
driving rainstorm as amelia carries her gear toward the electra
the umbrellas arent keeping them dry
the buildings have thatched roofs
there are oxcarts by the runway abandoned to the downpour
fred has to shout over the storm
he just glares at her
rain pounding all around them
he doesnt move
stay if you like
and she climbs into the plane
he just stands in the rain and glowers
the electra roaring down the runway
its all alone no one else crazy enough to be out there
at last the plane
lifts into the rain
wobbles just a beat
and begins to a wrenching battle plane versus monsoon
the storm is heavier deafening actually stripping paint from the electras wings
amelia beyond exhaustion but focused fighting it
we think shes flying alone
fred drops into the seat beside her
no words as he watches her struggle
our plane is all over the sky
the din is ungodly
an air pocket drops them feet
she glances over
for once shes scared
thats more like it
she starts to turn the plane around
amelia flying down through heavy turbulence though it is no longer raining
her features tense
we see the accumulated strain of the adventure
red appears from the catwalk slips into the seat beside her
points and we see
calcutta below sprawling and endless
between us and the ground a huge gathering of flying shapes
if one of those clips a propeller
or flies into the engine
her tired features form a smile
ve got an idea
lets never land
better safe than sorry
he takes her point
she turns back to work
ill wake you when the coffees ready
and with cold blooded nerve she swoops down down through the flock of eagles scattering them as we arc in for a perfect landing
she never turns to
fred who is still white knuckling trying to get his heart started
he cant believe what shes just done
cream no sugar
establishing shot of a graceful pillar of the raj
a fountain in an ornate courtyard
there is a reception as every evening for amelia attended by local dignitaries
fred already a little drunk leads amelia to a massive teak wood table
he breaks off the corner of a cracker sets it down in the center of the table
he strikes a match
snuffs the flame
puts the burned out match head just by the scrap of cracker
lack smoke from the navy ship that could help us get a fix
points way across the marble courtyard
now stand over there
thats what its going to look like if the weathers good
she glances up
he beckons respectfully
alcove still with a view of fred and the courtyard
she lifts a telephone
close on a wall map
we realize that george has been fol lowing her odyssey on a map of his own
we pull back to reveal
he looks elegant in crisp suit and tie
intercut amelias eyes wide
she seems truly thrilled
intercut between them now throughout
oh my goodness
simpkin is it really you
george makes a purring sound
a sharp meow
this is insane
its so extravagant
it gets worse i bought a brand new suit and tie
got a date with my wife
we cant possibly afford this
ure we can
its tuesdays call o lae that we cant afford
amelia delighted you hang up the phone this minute
youll bankrupt us and ill have to walk home
easoning with me
a magnificent display of useless courage
her eyes remember
and its fun
hold on her face
and match dissolve to
amelias face as we left it in the first scene
the storm pelting all around the open sided bar
fred studying her across the table
a touching love story really
hes been drinking we can hear it in his voice
see the bottle now
an honest one
its what you wanted
i wonder if its honest enough for george
if its what he wanted
if you mean gene were not together anymore
in that way
not for a long time
whose choice was that
she doesnt like his tone
shifts in her seat
it was mine
well isnt it always
you choose in you choose out
makes things easy
anything but easy
are you disapproving of the way i live
its just like me
in fact its like most guys i know
actually id like a piece of it myself
right about now
her eyes harden
a if you have a point fred
oh i believe i have
she rises slowly
zips her flight jacket
takes her slicker from the back of her chair
allow me to cut you a deal my friend
steel in the spine of that
you show up tomorrow morning
you show up sober and you get me to howland island
and ill forget you ever said that
she wheels around and holding her slicker over her head goes off into the pounding rain
freds smile is gone
he stares after her
amelia down the path in her slicker toward a small hut
opens the door to reveal
the radio receiver and transmitter
the operator balfour is a wiry scot
he nods respectfully
he stands and she takes his seat
he shows her the key to press then steps back toward the window
but she makes no move to the radio
just stares at him
he doesnt understand
amelia gently feel like stepping out for a smoke
i dont smoke
the monsoon beats down
if you need help ill be right outside
in the rain
ill only be a moment
he puts on his slicker
opens an umbrella
she looks back to the radio
flips the switch
e amelia soft arhart here
george at a window looking west
over the pacific
shes there somewhere
you should be sleeping
he smiles to keep his voice up
the eyes arent smiling
we intercut their conversation throughout
you should be working
im running a big adventure here m a very important fellow
you told me i was the star
and you were no one at all
george soft i thought i was lying
guess the jokes on me
im mad at him
ill be in honolulu on the rd and with you in oakland for fourth of july
dont keep me waiting
i wont dare
youre a very important feline
talk to me about fred
fred is fine
hes calculating head wind speed versus fuel as we speak
close on his face
you wouldnt sell a salesman would you
so whats that i hear in your voice
is he drinking
amelia soft i can handle it
call it off
i mean it
i can handle it
i love you
after the fourth
were going home
anywhere you are
she begins to cry
both hands fly to her mouth and she looks away
she swallows hard
im going to like it there
since this is my last flight
a long silence
if you insist
ts late here
guess ill go curl up under a teacup
ill go tell the world youre on your way
neither wants to let go
we feel it so strong
george a whisper sweet dreams
amelia whispers back see ya
and hes gone
she stares at the radio
flicker of a kerosene lamp
amelia writing at a tiny desk
lost in it
a sober contrite fred comes down the runway in early light
as he reaches the electra he sees a pile of discarded objects on the tarmac
metal containers carton of oranges parachutes
bedrolls cold weather gear
souvenirs from their stops flags a metal plaque native crafts a welcome miss amelia earhart banner
as he studies the pile
a coffee pot comes flying out of the plane to roll at his feet
suddenly a pound coffee tin sails past as he ducks
amelia appears at the hatch sees him
youre finding the range
but it might be easier to just shoot me
she stares at him for a moment
a subdued voice
traveling light thats all
she sits on the lip of the hatch
her legs dangling
her eyes down
got room for pounds of asshole
shes still looking down
hes never seen her like this
aam i am so sor
her eyes come up
he doesnt understand but hes glad to be forgiven
she takes a letter from her pocket
runs her finger over the envelope
i can run into town before we go
et that in the post for you
she shakes her head slowly
its for my husband
im going to hand it to him
so i can watch his face as he reads it
she sniffles slightly
its our tradition
a runway that ends in a drop off at the waters of huon gulf
the electra engines revving
ready to go for it
our angle closes on the belly of the plane
the antenna mast supporting a trailing wire antenna
they lined up on the thousand yard runway
one thousand gallons of fuel enough for to hours of flying
crew and onlookers watch as the plane starts its run gathering speed bouncing over uneven ground
close now on the jouncing undercarriage a momentary puff of dust and as the plane moves past we may notice that the belly antenna mast seems to be gone
down the runway it rumbles still earthbound only yards to go
then fifty then at the waters edge the electra rises and
drops out of sight below the land as we smash cut to
the electra has fallen to six feet above the surface of the gulf
the engines throb at max the propellers throwing spray
the overloaded plane
slowly then faster then
pull back to a view from down the runway
the electra in distance
rack focus to see something long and slender glinting on the ground
could it be a length of wire
through the glass the sun is disappearing toward amelia
pull back to george staring at a cable in his hands
their headwinds are stronger than they knew when they took off
i recalculated their fuel
it will cost them
george staring off
assessing the consequences
pull back to see an ensign standing waiting for instruction
i cant raise them sir
i tried voice and morse code
george looks up
tell him to forget the morse code
they didnt bring the receiver
the young man looks concerned
just tell him to stay with voice
hell get them
a tiny flat nearly invisible speck adrift in the endless pacific
pan to see just offshore
coast guard cutter itasca had been anchored off howland just for us
close on the itasca now
its radio would be her lifeline
its black plume of smoke would reach for miles
more visible than the island itself
dissolve to night
the island visible only by its slender lighthouse
the ship illuminated in the darkness
close now on a path by the sea
a lone figure with a flashlight approaches a shack
a room filled with radio equipment
he is frank cipriani in crisp naval uniform relieving a seaman who has been on duty
as cipriani sits at his station he notices
the direction finder
how long has this been on
the seaman turns back at the door
close on the ship illuminated
the room is x with bare walls
at the transmitter leo bellarts the chief radio man
short and square an unflappable air of quiet expertise
with him his assistant william dalten lean and young with dark serious eyes
at a typewriter sits thomas ohare barely twenty headphones across his shock of rust colored hair telegraph at the ready
dalten adjusting the receiver which is suddenly spitting static
threading through the noise what could be a human voice
bellarts calls to ohare
thats her on
she said cloudy and overcast
ohare looks at him
are you serious
bellarts mimes typing with his fingers
ohare starts typing into the log
all eyes turn
itasca from earhart
dalten leans to the mic
dalten into mic we are receiving your signal
please acknowledge ours
what is your position
when do you expect to arrive howland
if shes having trouble on voice transmission stay with morse
and begins to carefully pack his pipe
dalten begins to transmit morse code
the sudden voice
please take bearing on us and report in half hour
i will make noise in microphone
we are about miles out
the transmission cuts out
dalten answers in morse code
shes got to stay on longer
bellarts dictating as ohare types
earhart signal strength but on ir so briefly bearings impossible
dalten to bellarts maybe her morse receiver is out
into mic cant take bearing on
please send on or do you want to take bearing on us
go ahead please
ohare typing no answer
dalten into mic please acknowledge our signals on ey
ohare typing unanswered
tommy intercom top deck double check the smoke stack
intercut aerial angle high above the ship
black smoke plumes into clear sky
they should be able to see it for twenty miles at least
in far distance thirty to forty miles a gray
a few others enter now
civilians sailors they hang back silently watching as
khaqq calling itasca
we must be on you but cannot see you
glances are traded
it is the first moment of visible concern
gas is running low
been unable to reach you by radio
we are flying t altitude feet
dalten into mic you are reaching us
we are sending on and constantly
massive burst of static
dalten frantically clicking a message in morse code
the room has nearly filled
commander thompson stands at bellarts shoulder
all eyes fixed on the radio
we are circling but cannot hear you
go ahead on
bellarts into mic itasca to khaqq
your signal is strong
are you receiving this
a breathless moment
a sharp crackle
khaqq calling itasca
we received your signal but unable to get a minimum
please take bearing on us and answer with voice
bellarts into mic your signal received okay
it is impractical to take a bearing on on your voice
give us a longer signal please
feet are shifting
no one speaks
bellarts softly to dalten keep us at thats her only acknowledgment
youve got her signal dammit
what about the direction finder
cipriani reports the batterys dead sir
it was left on all night
thompson low i dont believe this is happening
bellarts into mic itasca to earhart
did you get transmission on
go ahead on so that we can take a bearing on you its impossible on
no breath in this room
no one moves
bellarts into mic will you please come in and answer n
we are transmitting constantly on and we do not hear you on
please answer on
suddenly a thin and anxious voice cuts through a burst of static
a we are on the line of position will repeat this message on kilocycles
wait listening n kilocycles
we are running north and south
bellarts into mic we hear you
we hear you
can you receive this
commander softly mr
when did she say she was low on fuel
all eyes shift to tommy
he scans the log
and two minutes sir
hold on this room
the ship in clear daylight
the black plume of smoke stretching to heaven
the tiny room weve come to know
it is filled with people who stand motionless staring somberly at one man
in turn he stares at a telephone
mary reaches but his hand goes up and she pulls back
he lets it ring three times four gathering himself
george into phone yes
there are no other words
his eyes tear up
he nods numbly at the phone
g looking back the questions were obvious
why would anyone try to ind such a tiny target in a vast ocean with barely an hours lee way in fuel
he draws a breath
george into phone well were most grateful
with such an effort of course theyll e found
close on him now
as he listens as he responds graciously so i tortured myself
why hadnt killed this plan on day one
and then i realized
in a moonlit garden
if i tried to count the insane and reckless chances she took from the first moment i met her
i wouldnt know where to begin
slowly to his knees
by the plants they had tended together
it was the most tragic of endings
the most cruel and senseless and wasteful
its hard to imagine another
sun and cloud
the sea below
we point toward the water
i want to be married to you
the way youve been married to me
it begins to draw closer
as you read this
i am watching your face
i am hoping to see
that you know how much i mean each word
gaining speed now
all the things i never said for so very long
hurtling toward the surface
theyre in my eyes
