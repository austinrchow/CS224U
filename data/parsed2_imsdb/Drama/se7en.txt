seven unproduced draft by andrew kevin walker by andrew kevin walker january the world is a fine place and worth fighting for
ernest hemingway for whom the bell tolls the white cross on the church steeple stands against blue sky
the church bell rings resonating
mass has let out
small church small congregation
the dirt road in front is lined with pick up trucks and parishioners on foot heading to outlying farms and homes
an old two story house sits across the road
sunlight comes through the soot on the windows more brown than bright
somerset in a suit and tie stands in this empty second story room
he looks around at the ceiling at the worn wooden floor at the peeling wallpaper on the walls
somerset walks to one wall where the current wallpaper is peeled away to reveal flowery wallpaper underneath
he runs his finger across one of the pale red roses that decorates the older paper
he pushes the grime away brings the rose out more clearly
he pulls at the edge of the paper carefully ripping off a roughly squared section with the rose at its center
he studies it in his hand
somerset stands pondering the forested landscape
is something wrong
somerset does not respond
the man in an ill fitting real estate jacket is seated on the hood of a dirty ford thunderbird
he holds a check and a booklet of receipts
is something the matter
theres nothing wrong
somerset still seems distant
writes receipt not that its any of my business
but are you figuring on moving out here eventually
i just never seen a man mortgaging an empty house before
everything here still seems
seems so strange to me
i dont know
id say this place is about as normal as places get
the man walks over to hand over a receipt
somerset accepts the receipt folds it
that is exactly what i mean
somerset looks back at the house
the man does not understand
somerset is in a window seat smoking a cigarette looking out the speeding train
he is near the back of the car away from the few other passengers
outside farms small homes and lawns pass
the entire panorama is dappled by the rays of the soon setting sun
the light flickers across somersets placid face
the train is nearly full
somerset has his suitcase on the aisle seat beside him
he has a hardcover book unopened on his lap
he still stares out the window but his disposition has soured
the train is passing an ugly swampy field
a cars burnt out skeleton sits rusting in the bracken
a little further on two dogs are fighting circling attacking their coats matted with blood
somerset turns his head to watch the dogs
away in the field another dog sprints to join the fight
passing urban streets below
people stand on the corners under the bleak glow of street lamps
somersets suitcase is by the window
somerset is now in the aisle seat reading his book
the sounds of the city are here as they will be everywhere in this story
a car alarm shrieks
somersets life is packed in many moving boxes except for clothing in a closet and hundreds of books on shelves
somerset dressed only in his underwear lays back on the bed
he reaches to the nightstand to a wooden pyramidical metronome
he frees the metronomes weighted swingarm so it moves back and forth
swings to the left
tick swings to the right
tick tick tick measured and steady
somerset situates on the bed closes his eyes
the metronomes ticking competes with the sound of the car alarm
somersets face tightens as he concentrates on the metronome
his eyes close tighter
tick tick tick
the swingarm moves evenly
somersets breathing deepens
the car alarm seems quieter
tick tick tick
somerset continues his concentration
the metronome is the only sound
somersets face relaxes slightly as he begins to fall asleep
tick tick tick
david mills exits with a bagged oz bottle of beer
he is a lean attractive man constantly coiled eyes always smoldering
follow as he walks quickly past iron gated storefronts
he crosses the street under elevated subway tracks
a train roars overhead
mills watches it as he walks on
blue sparks spit off the third rail and illuminate mills throwing his shadow long down the deserted street
this rotting neighborhood lives in the shadow of a single fat skyscraper
mills walks looks at the broken refrigerators and pieces of junk in the gutter
ahead in the street two young thugs struggle with a crowbar to break into the trunk of a parked car
mills draws near
one thug looks up doesnt think mills will be a problem continues prying
mills stops calm
is that your car man
what the fuck do you care
mills pauses switches his beer bottle to his other hand
does that car belong to you
the thugs look at each other gauging
they face mills
yeah its my car alright
youre telling me thats your car
the second thug starts the long way round the car
well for some strange reason i dont believe you
mills gives a isnt that silly laugh shifts his gaze sees the first thug slide the crowbar so its held as a weapon
steps forward you can fucking suck my
mills swiftly finishes that sentence by smashing his bottle against the first thugs head
the thug falls swings blindly
the second thug moves from the side brings out a knife
mills averts swings pounds the side of his fist into the second thugs face crack
the second thug stumbles back drops the knife his nose squirting blood
mills turns enraged breathing hard
the first thug is screaming trying to stand
mills takes one step punts the first thugs head
the crowbar clatters away
mills is in the process of kicking a man when hes down when the second thug grabs him from behind pulls him backwards
mills clutches at the thugs arm trying to avoid a choke hold
they both struggle spastically
the thugs winning
gurgling gasping for air mills shifts his weight drops to one knee and spins the thug slamming him against the car
mills breaks loose grabs a handful of the second thugs hair and holds the mans head against the cars side window
mills free hand pounds the thugs face once twice third times the charm as the window shatters
the thug goes out cold
mills backs off still incensed
he rubs his throat looking at the two prone men
slowly he regains some composure
he takes a keychain from his pocket
he unlocks the door of the car loads one of the thugs into the back seat
he walks to collect the other thug off the street
somerset picks items off a moving box keys wallet homicide badge
finally he opens the hardcover book from the train
from the pages he takes the pale wallpaper rose
a wall is stained by a starburst of blood
somerset stands melancholy looking at a body on the floor under a sheet near a sawed off shotgun
the apartment is gloomy
detective taylor looks through a notepad
neighbors heard them screaming at each other
it was nothing new or unusual
but then they heard the gun go off
did his wife confess
did she actually speak the words
when the patrolman got here she was trying to put his head back together
she was crying too hard to say anything
shuts notebook crime of passion
look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here
taylor shifts his weight impatient annoyed
this is a done deal
all but the paperwork
somerset looks at a coloring book open on the coffee table
there are crayons beside it
somerset picks the book up
he flips through crudely colored pictures
did their son see it happen
what kind of question is that
pointing hes dead
his wife killed him
there it is
anything else has nothing to do with nothing
somerset replaces the book digs up a cigarette from his pocket
you and your fucking questions somerset
im glad im getting rid of you today
you know that you fuck
david mills enters dressed in a suit
he looks a bit lost
somerset lights his cigarette looks to mills
im david mills
your new partner
a body bag is carried through the crowd around the tenement doors
mills follows somerset
they walk towards the end of the filthy block
im a little thrown
i just finished orientation at central and they dumped me off down here
i heard you brought in two small timers last night
two real idiots
since we are just starting out i thought we could go to a bar
sit and talk for awhile
that way we can
excuse me but id rather start sniffing for a case if its all the same to you
seeing how we only have a week for this whole transition thing
waits i want to get into the shit a
know what i mean
somerset walks no reply
mills searches to get a read on him
i meant to ask you something
when we spoke on the phone
i cant help wondering
pause why are you here
i dont follow
all this effort youve gone through to be transferred from philadelphia to here
its the first question that pops into my head
mills formulates his response
im here for the same reasons as you i guess
at least the same reasons you used to have for being here
cutting before you decided to give up
somerset stops and faces mills
you think you know me
you just met me two minutes ago
maybe i dont understand the question
its very simple
youve come from the city of brotherly love to the city of brotherly hate detective
ive never seen it done that way
i dont know
maybe i thought i could do more good here than there
pause you know itd be great by me if we didnt start right out kicking each other in the balls
but youre calling the shots lieutenant so however you want it to go
let me tell you how i want this to go
i want you to look and i want you to listen
i wasnt standing around philly guarding the fucking liberty bell
but youve never worked homicide in this city
i realize that
well please do me the favor of remembering it
mills just stares back at somerset
mills rolls his eyes looks to heaven like whatd i do to deserve this
he follows somerset
somerset lies asleep on the bed
it is still dark outside
the phone beside the inactive metronome rings harshly
somerset awakens suddenly rankled
it is barely becoming light outside
mills cant sleep
alone in a double bed
he sits up frustrated
sits on the edge of the bed and looks around
the room is a shambles filled with moving boxes
the light coming through the window glows upon a football trophy on one box
large and noble a golden player stands in frozen motion at the trophys pinnacle
mills looks at the trophy and a fond smile forms on his face
the clinking of dishes and silverware is heard from another room
mills looks at the closed bedroom door troubled
across a living room full of boxes tracy mills a beautiful woman stands in her bathrobe
shes upset about something takes dishes out of boxes puts them on the kitchenette counter
she pulls a mug from a clump of newspaper and pours some tea from a pot on the stove
blowing on the steaming tea she leans back on the counter looks over at the closed bedroom door
the tea is too hot to sip and as tracy is placing the mug on the counter behind her the phone rings
startled she releases the mug too close to the edge
it falls crashes to the floor shatters
a dark hall
somerset and mills stand with officer davis a beefy uniformed cop
light from a cameras flash spills in from the nearby kitchen
davis hands somerset two flashlights
at what time did you confirm the death
like i said we didnt touch anything but we were on scene at like o five hundred so hes had his face in a plate of spaghetti for about half
wait wait wait
you didnt check him
you didnt check vital signs
believe me hes gone
unless hes breathing spaghetti sauce now
the point is when youre first man in you check vital signs
this guys sitting in a pile of his own shit and piss
if he aint dead he would have stood up by now
getting angry listen godzilla
somerset steps in heads mills off
thank you officer davis
well see you again after weve had a look
davis leaves eyeing mills
mills watches him
somerset hands mills a flashlight takes out surgical gloves
i wonder what exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into
and i wonder how many times officer davis there has found a supposedly dead man who didnt really die until davis was back in the patrol car calling the morgue
and eating a powdered donut
somerset snaps one glove over his hand and checks the fit
we have more important concerns just now dont we
the police photographer packs up hoists his camera and equipment bag
somerset and mills enter
mills puts on his own pair of rubber gloves
the grubby kitchen is small barely room for four people to move around in
the photographer exits bon appetit
the only light is a murky green illumination from the ceiling
the light bathes an obese man who is slumped forward in a kitchen chair face down dead in a plate of spaghetti
the sizable kitchen tables green tablecloth is covered with soiled paper plates
the plates hold bits of half eaten sandwiches potatoes donuts and other junk food remnants
mills and somerset turn on their flashlights
mills points his at the green bulb above
aluminum foil has been wrapped around the bulb to focus the light on the corpse
somerset sweeps the room with his flashlight
he goes to the body and kneels beside it
theres a rope tied around the mans wide gut
mills comes to stand beside somerset
i guess that makes it homicide
somerset crouches lower uses a pen to lift one of the dead mans pants cuffs
rope is tied around the purplish ankle
mills examines the knots behind the chairs back
shines his flashlight on the mans belly
still he could have tied himself in
to make it look like murder
somerset isnt listening focused on the corpse
he studies the mans head and neck without touching
i dont see any blood or bruises yet
you see anything
irritated not yet
somerset stands points his flashlight the obese mans stiff hands are clutching utensils
a knife in the left hand a fork sticking straight up in the right with a hunk of meat hanging skewered
mills turns to the sink and stove
each burner of the stove has a used pot or pan on it
theres food slopped everywhere
i saw a guy once
committed suicide but he wanted to make sure his family could collect insurance money right
somerset walks to the rooms only window
the window has been painted over with black paint
he touches the window with his pinkie finger
the paint is still wet
mills goes to a trash can by the refrigerator
the trash can is full to the brim with empty food containers
so this guy took this big knife
and he held it behind him put the tip of it in his back and he ran backwards into the wall
cause he thought it was going to look like someone stabbed him in the back
mills opens the refrigerator
its nearly empty
except he poked a big fucking hole in the dry wall when he did it
if you could
spare me the anecdotes for now
leave the refrigerator open for the light
sarcastic oh forgive me
i thought we had this male bonding thing going
somerset looks at the floor deep in thought
his flashlight beam follows a trail of dripped sauces soups and bits of food running from the stove to the table
what do you smell
other than him and all the food
sniffs i dont know
somerset goes close to the table then leans to peer under
somerset points the flashlight and mills crouches pulls up the tablecloth on his side of the table
two large dead rats lay on the floor beside a metal bucket
mills grimaces slides under the table careful to avoid the rats
he looks in the bucket
he leans back baffled
he looks at somerset under the table
its a bucket of vomit
is there any blood in it
cant tell by looking
somerset stands perplexed stares at the dead man
there is a knock at the door
the detectives look to doctor thomas oneill the medical examiner
oneill is a frumpy man seems a bit gone looking at the green bulb
he drops his bag on the floor sorts through the contents
to somerset you think he was poisoned
mills goes to the trash can pokes the garbage with a pencil
and those rats there somehow ate the poison off the floor
guessing this early is useless
you girls have got the forensics guys out there chompin at the bit
dont know if well all fit in here though
mills continues searching the garbage
lights the problem
well three is certainly a crowd in here
and with four someones bound to be stepping on evidence
pause detective mills go help the officers question the neighbors
not pleased thanks but no thanks
ill stay on this
somerset watches oneill at the corpse
oneill points a thin flashlight with his mouth his hands free for the examination
not looking up send one forensic in on your way out
mills is pissed
he lifts his flashlight to shine it on the side of somersets face
a moment passes
somerset looks at mills light shining directly in somersets eyes
a longer moment
mills switches the light off
oneill unceremoniously places both hands on the dead mans head lifts the swollen visage from the spaghetti
he is dead
mills punches the heavy bag with hard quick punches
sweat drips off his face
hes in work out clothing a bundle of nerves wearing boxing gloves
the walls are covered in mirrors
other cops watch mills as they pass checking out the new kid
mills keeps punching skillfully
he stops when he sees somerset reflected in one of the mirrors
somerset walks over carrying a pizza box with paper piled on top
he sits on a near bench takes out a cigarette
pizza and paperwork detective mills
we need to chat
mills opens a door and enters with somerset behind
they are alone
chairs face an old limp roped boxing ring
practice pads hang from pegs on a wall
mills clasps a pair in his gloves offers them to somerset
you just hold them up
i do all the work
somerset takes the pads reluctantly puts them on
he still has the un lit cigarette hanging from his mouth
mills climbs into the ring
he holds the ropes open for somerset waits
somerset doesnt want to do this but he climbs up
youve seen my files
seen the things ive done
mills motions to somerset and somerset holds up the practice pads
mills starts working them lightly warming up
so whats your problem
ive done my time on door to doors and walking a beat
i know it
that doesnt mean
i did all that shit a long time ago
somersets very stiff uncomfortable
i made a decision because i have to worry about the integrity of the scene
when im on scene im not going to worry whether you think youre getting enough time on the playing field
im there to do the work
mills punches a little more aggressively
somersets backing flinching keeping the pads high
the badge in my pocket says detective just like yours
ive been homicide for four and a half years
youve worked homicide for four years or for five years
dont count the half years unless you want to sound like a rookie
mills unloads a mighty wallop and one practice pad recoils into somersets face knocks somerset on his ass
my hand slipped
mills walks climbs out of the ring
you fucked me over today and you know it
you know it
somerset looks at the broken cigarette in his mouth
he contains his anger
he seems to realize mills has a point
just dont jerk me off
thats all i ask
its not much
dont jerk me off
pause please do me the favor of remembering that
somerset spits out the broken cigarette
tracy looks out a window from behind steel bars
below her young children play in a playground
theyre playing hop scotch throwing balls chasing each other
the swing sets are broken
the handball wall is graffitied
im sorry mrs
we dont have anything right now
tracy looks away from the window to the haggard woman
the schools office is ill equipped busy disorganized
well try to give you a call if we need substitutes next month
tracy looks back at the playground on the other side of a chain link fence a butcher in a bloody apron walks down the ramp of a freezer truck
he carries a big whole slaughtered pig on his shoulder
the pigs head flops as the butcher walks
some children stop their games and run to watch the man and the pig corpse pass
the train clatters through a tunnel packed full wheels screeching
the lights go on and off
passengers read tabloids stare at their feet study advertisements on the walls anything to avoid making eye contact with others
all races creeds and colors all ugly forlorn human beings
tracy stands fatigued holding a handrail
a bag lady crusted with dirt reeking pushes her way through the crowd
a man presses against tracy in an attempt to let the bag lady pass
tracy switches hands on the rail turns sideways to make room
she looks down
on one seat a man quite normal looking sits holding a porno magazine three way fuck in one hand
his other hand is in his pocket
hes obviously masturbating himself in his pants
no one else notices or seems to care
tracy looks away disgusted
she closes her eyes
the trains wheels screech louder as the train takes a curve
the front and one side of the shop are entirely open to the busy sidewalk and street
a transparent plastic canopy frames the entrance
a strange man stands at the edge of the canopy
he wears a stained sweatsuit outfit and hums a song oblivious
tracy and mills look together over the piles of fruits and vegetables piled on wooden stands which form tight aisles
it was okay
it was certainly better than yesterday
i think somerset and i came to a small understanding
mills holds his thumb and forefinger about a quarter of an inch apart to illustrate
about this big
he sounds interesting
he is that if nothing else
mills throws some oranges in the basket hanging from tracys arm
he goes to check out the carrots
tracy looks up from heads of lettuce to the strange man at the entrance
the strange man hums on rocking back and forth slowly his eyes glassy
customers come and go paying him no mind
mills notices tracys interest
he keeps comparing carrots
we started a big homicide case today
ill spare you the grisly details
the strange man suddenly stops humming and looks into the store with a crooked grin
name that tune
anybody name that tune
name that tune
the man keeps repeating this over and over still ignored
its like they emptied all the insane asylums into the streets
she looks back to the heads of lettuce
thats what its like
like they just gave up and let everyone out
mills nods his back to tracy
there are a lot of frightening people in this city
there are a lot of frightening people in the world
tracy looks again to the strange man
name that tune
anybody name that tune
it seems worse than philadelphia because everything is pushed right up against you
in your face
mills edges past tracy towards the front of the store tries to be pleasant
i dont want to fight tonight
can we just go one night without fighting about something
he looks over apples thinks thats the end of that
im not trying to start a fight
pause how am i trying to start a fight
were here now
are we supposed to pack it all in and go back
how are we going to do that
do i have to act like i love this place
is that what a good wife would do
doleful theres a lot of pressure on me
and theres a lot of pressure on me
im here with you
mills steps towards the open air entrance
hes watching something
the strange man is still heard offscreen
tracy reaches to a high wooden shelf trying to reach a bag of rice her back to mills
im not going to close my eyes and block everything out david
im not going to act like you delivered us to some sort of paradise
she gets the rice and turns
mills is not there
she sighs angry looks around
she walks towards the entrance and sees him in front of the stand mills has run to the corner of the sidewalk to help a very old woman with a
the elderly woman smiles up at mills takes his arm as he helps her off the curb and across the street
he talks to her as they go
tracys anger fades
she shakes her head touched amazed by the plain boy scoutishness of her husband
mills deposits the old woman on the other side
she thanks him patting him on the cheek
mills starts back towards the fruit stand proud of himself
a car screeches to a halt just missing him
the driver leans out the window yelling at mills
mills kicks the side of the car
as car leaves fuck you you son of a bitch
im walking here
tracy rolls her eyes in amused disappointment
she sighs again
mills passes the babbling strange man comes up to tracy
i couldnt pass it up
i never had a chance to actually do that
but we can start the argument right back up where we left off right
tracy looks at him charmed no longer willing to fight
playing dumb what
tracy wraps an arm around mills and kisses him
he holds her
that was the theme from tvs mod squad
im surprised nobody got that one
the strange man starts humming a new tune
an old man tries to get through the aisle where mills and tracy are kissing
infuriated excuse me
a small transistor radio plays on the bedside table
mills and tracy are in bed making love under the sheets
they move rhythmically kissing sweating hard
mills holds tracys hair in his hands pulls her head back as she gasps and he thrusts his entire body against hers
mills hair is soaked
he is anything but mellow as a lover quickening while tracy twists underneath him
tracy holds tight to the back of his neck with one hand
finally mills pushes himself up on his arms holding his head down against tracys chest
holds for a long moment till he is spent and lowers himself against her into her arms
he rests a long time
she kisses his forehead keeping her eyes closed
finally mills rolls off her gets behind her and wraps the both of them in the sheets
he folds himself against her and they stay that way
after a long moment mills shifts back sits up
tracy looks over her shoulder at him as he takes a towel off a chair and stands
mills wraps the towel around his waist
he leans over to give tracy a last kiss
she watches him leave the room
she is about to say something but does not
a light comes on in the other room leaking through the door
mills sits down at his desk
he starts looking through police paperwork
the radio in the other room goes off in mid song
the room is cold clean
many pathologists work at slabs
mills and somerset are with doctor santiago who stands over the mostly dissected obese corpse
if you take a look here buddies
i can tell you it was not a poison
if you can see
i have emptied all of everything out of the stomach
but look at it now that i took away the liver
santiago reaches into the belly of the cavernous corpse
mills moves closer beside somerset but not too close trying to hide his disgust
we hear squashy sounds as santiago works but we dont see in
i move the lungs over
first see how big this fat son of a bitch stomach is
here is the strange thing on the stomach
pointing and here is it distended
look at the size of that because of the foods
i can see what youre pointing at
on the stomach
the lines of distention
somersets looking in not believing what he sees
doctor are you saying this man
ate till he burst
yes well he didnt actually burst
he was bleeding inside of himself
and theres a hemotoma on the outside
on the belly
somerset walks around the slab looking the body over
he died by eating
someone punched him or kicked him
somerset notices something on the partially shaved head
he leans close to look at five or six small bruises on the back of the dead mans head circular bruises some darker than others all about the same diameter
as a dime
oh and there is this here
something else you have to look at and see
somerset stands straight realizes something about the bruises
most of his stomach contents are in the lab now
i found these in the fat mans stomach
santiago looks amongst tools buckets and jars of liquid
he picks up a glass jar and shows it to mills
in the jar many little bits of blue plastic
mills gets somersets attention hands him the jar
somerset looks at it a long time
why these were in a fat mans stomach i dont know
outside the door to the murder scene mills and somerset cut through the restricted area crime scene seal
those bruises on the back of the victims head were caused by the muzzle of a gun
so the killer had him at gunpoint and gave him a choice eat or get your head blown off
somerset and mills enter
somerset takes out the jar of plastic scrapings turns on the now normal light
they begin to search
he was force fed
till his body started rejecting the food
he literally couldnt eat another bite
so the killer held a bucket under him
his throat was swollen from the effort
he was bleeding internally
he must have blacked out
and if youre the killer youre not going to want to wait around for him to die
somerset examines the counter tops and wall
mills gets down on his knees examines the linoleum floor
you kick him pop him like a fucking balloon
touches floor somerset look here
somerset gets down holds the jar against the linoleum
same color and texture
they both crawl on hands and knees study every inch of floor
if this is what that is
it doesnt make sense
it doesnt figure
always look for one thing to focus on
theres always one singular thing and it might be as small as a speck of dust but find it and focus
till its an exhausted possibility
how are pieces of the floor going to get in the guys stomach
why would so many pieces be inside his stomach unless they were placed there intentionally
somerset notices deep scratches in the linoleum fingers the grooves
he takes a piece of plastic from the jar holds it to the scratches fiddles with it fits it in
he looks up to see these scratches are in front of the refrigerator
it looks like they were caused by the refrigerator having been pulled away from the wall and pushed back at some time
we are behind the refrigerator as it is rocked back and forth
its pulled away from the wall
somerset and mills strain pull a few more feet then release
they lean to look the refrigerator had hidden a space on the wall where the dust has been cleared
in that space a circle smeared in grease and a note taped in the center of the circle
somersets beeper starts beeping
mills leans to read dear detectives
long is the way and hard that out of hell leads up to the light
looks at somerset this is not good
its a quote from a book
miltons paradise lost
somerset takes out his beeper looks at the led window
he looks up at mills like theyve received very bad news
a marble hallway
a detective nervously chewing his nails quickly leads mills and somerset past cops and forensics
i said to myself im not going to screw around with this
its still pretty fresh meat
i called the medical examiner
stops at door when i got to it i knew
as soon as i laid eyes on it i knew
the detective opens the door
follow somerset and mills gross deep yellow light comes through the only window with its blinds up
the light anoints a nude man displayed dead
this is your guy who did this
the nude dead mans legs are folded under him as if he were kneeling and hes bent forward chin on the floor
his eyes are open his arms outstretched before him
mills and somerset walk to either side of the man
the detective closes the door bites his thumbnail
the apartment is on a high floor so its quiet
somerset sees the window has been covered with a sheet of yellow gel stapled in place to produce the colored light
mills examines the corpse
theres a chair one foot behind the nude man
its an elegant leather chair drenched in blood
theres a carving knife on the carpet in the middle of a huge stain of blood under the chair
mills looks at pieces of cut rope on the floor behind the chair
the rope is knotted
somerset crouches beside the body
theres a big piece of flesh missing from the mans left side as if the love handle had been lopped off
hundreds of pennies lie scattered under and around the man
the mans hands are palms up fingers wrapped around more pennies
mills walks over to examine a scale on the floor between the corpse and the doorway
its an old fashioned counter balance scale with two suspended dishes on a see saw arm
in the high dish the hunk of flesh missing from the mans side
in the low dish a one pound counterweight
to somerset a pound of flesh
somerset stands and walks backwards to view the entire scene from near the door
he looks worried vaguely frightened
he turns his head looks to a far wall
beside a big abstract constructivist painting theres a note pinned up inside a triangular smear of blood
an office full of pictures books and mugsheets yet it is meticulously well kept
the captain sits at his tidy desk
hes dressed conservatively
mills and somerset sit before him
somerset reads from a photocopy of the note they just found
reading one pound of flesh no more no less
no cartilage no bone but only flesh
this task done and he would go free
the captain is a calm man but whenever not speaking without fail he clenches his jaw repeatedly causing the muscles in his neck and jaw to pulse
somerset stands paces
this victim mr
gold was tied down nude holding a carving knife
and he was given a long time
where to make the first cut
theres a gun to your head
but what part or parts of your body are expendable
mills sits back in his chair arms crossed seems anxious doesnt know why theyre here
gold tried for the whole pound at once his love handle
but he went into shock
bled to death
what is the point somerset
look at both killings together
this murderer is an artist
he uses colors and symbols
he positions the bodies after death so hes working with composition
its been premeditated so meticulously
and this is just the beginning
for all we know we might never hear from him again and i dont want that kind of talk floating around
somerset shakes his head no
the rats and the pennies
the circle and the triangle on the wall
theres something about them
these murders mean something
somerset has no answer
the captain is irked jaw clenching
to mills you with him or you just here to watch
this is his stuff captain
ive been out in the cold most of the day
to somerset always working overtime up in that big brain of yours huh
i need you to know
i want us reassigned
were declining this case
sits up angry what
what the hell are you talking about
this cannot be my last duty here
its going to go on and on
youve left unfinished business before
everything else was taken as close to a conclusion as humanly possible
can i just say something
i dont think this should be mills first case
this is not my first case fuckhead
i dont have anyone else to give this to somerset
and nobodys going to swap with you
give it to me then
theres nothing that says i have to fly with him
the captain considers this
if somerset wants out fuck him
it would be too much for him too soon
to captain could we talk about this in private
the captain looks at somerset then at mills
thats not necessary
thank you sir
start picking up the pieces
ill shuffle some paper and try to get you a new partner
somerset will not look him in the eye
mills leaves slams the door
somerset seems deflated
you win somerset
a vendor lays out a pile of tabloid newspapers at his busy newsstand
the headline second bizarre murder
in huge print
the vendor lays out another tabloid pile
headline give me my pound of flesh says bloodthristy killer in big red letters
the vendor places a third pile beside the others sickening old office
moving boxes on the floor
the single window faces a billboard
somerset works on a manual typewriter
he types hunt and peck slowly
his paperwork is on the desk in two sloppy piles
a jarring sound is heard offscreen like fingers on a blackboard
somerset looks up irritated
a workman is working at the open door holding the source of the sound a razor blade hes using to scrape the words detective somerset off the doors window
somerset turns back to typing
the captain steps in looks at the workman then drops more papers on somersets desk
as always the neatly groomed captain clenches his jaw
he looks around
two of boxes on the floor have detective mills written across them
the captain picks one up puts it on top of the other
he sits watching somerset starts straightening the forms on the desk
what are you going to do with yourself out there somerset
ill get a job
maybe on a farm
ill fix up my house
cant you feel it yet
pause cant you feel that feeling
that you wont be special anymore
lying i dont know what you mean
somerset reclines looks at the captain
did you read in the paper today about the man who took his dog for a walk
and how he was mugged
and his wallet was taken and his watch
then while he was still lying unconscious his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes
it happened last night
not far from here
i have no understanding of this place
its always been like this
somerset saddles up to the typewriter
hunt and peck
youre absolutely right
the captain lays the paperwork down in two neat stacks
you were made for this work somerset
i cant believe youre going to trade it all in for a tool belt and a fishing rod
but i guess im wrong
the captain leaves
somerset looks up now that the captains gone
he grabs the paper piles and ruffles them back to their disheveled state
he looks at the workman
the workman is looking at somerset has a rag in his hand to remove the last remnants of somersets name
angrily put a little elbow grease into it
the workman is startled continues his work
the grandly furnished apartment where the second murder took place has been dusted for prints and searched
two female forensics are at work
mills is seated in front of a long writing desk with many drawers
all the drawers are open
mills looks through letters and stationary
nothing of use
he tosses the pile back
he sits back frustrated yanks off one rubber glove looks around the room
books have been taken off their shelves the bed has been stripped
the room has been given the once over
the victims family photographs hang in expensive frames on one wall
there are at least thirty photos of various sizes ancestors sons and daughters grandchildren and friends
an over weight forensic chris leans in through the doorway
mills looks up and chris shakes his head glumly
he must have left us another puzzle to solve
well keep looking but were running out of possibilities
chris leaves and mills stands to stretch
something catches mills eye
he walks over to the door curious
at the base of the open door theres a ball of paper wedged under to act as a doorjamb
mills puts his glove back on pulls the ball out
he uncrumples the paper as the door slowly swings shut
the page has a drawing on it of the sun with waves of heat at its edges
there is a single eye in the center of the sun
an arrow is drawn in dried blood on the back of the closing door
mills notices this and pushes the door closed
the blood arrow points to the side and up seems to be pointing to the photo gallery wall
mills goes to examine the photos
his eyes search each photo
one by one
till he sees it christ
a framed photo of a falsely pretty middle aged woman smiling and wearing pearls
under the glass on the photo itself circles have been drawn in blood around the womans eyes an assault on the senses
crowded streets and sidewalks
on every corner in every doorway on every stairwell freaks junkies punks leather boys and motorcycle girls
a few tourists wander in the mix heedful of the dangers around them
buildings border narrowly
somerset walks against the stream
he carries a file
car horns howl
music blasts from the entrances of clubs
reggae from one club is soon overtaken by rap from a second story window
techno pop blasts from the tattoo parlor
somerset does not like this place views it with disdain
he walks to avoid two men fighting on the ground
the men are pulling hair and pounding each other idiotically
somerset takes a cigarette from a full pack lights it as he crosses through the traffic jam in the street
a vagrant steps up with his hand out
spare me a cigarette money grip
spare me a cigarette
he walks on
we begin to hear jazz music
a club at capacity
the jazz music continues like a slow cool breeze from a jazz trio on a platform
the air is thick with smoke
yuppies sit elbow to elbow with the last members of the beat generation
everyones drinking beer smoking pot
somerset crosses the club looking for someone
he takes a tissue from his pocket rips pieces off and jams the pieces in his ears
at the back of the club a major league bouncer stands in front of a closed door
somerset shows his badge and the bouncer steps aside with reservation
the walls are black
somerset opens the door enters walks down the long flight of stairs
as somerset descends the jazz music fades and is engulfed by the sound of speed metal
at the bottom somerset opens another door
he enters a narrow room
speed metal is even louder
this is a private art party
the people are lizard like pale
men and women priding themselves on their gauntness
somerset passes canvases on the walls
pointlessly abstract paintings
splatters smears and blobs of color
party people stand in front of these works engrossed
somerset slides past not interested in the art jamming the tissue further in his ears
he spots his objective
william mccracken stands inside a circle of admirers
he is dressed like a pauper his baggy clothing stained with many colors of paint
he wears dark sunglasses bored by the bleached blonde girl whispering in his ear
somerset worms his way to stand in front of william
the party goers turn their attention to this intrusion
william looks up pushes the girl away
he takes off his sunglasses
his eyes are badly bloodshot and listless
he looks somerset over
and then grins glad to see him
mills stands brooding over a photocopy of the picture of the woman with her eyes circled in blood
he looks overworked drinks coffee
his desk is swamped with files
i have voiced the same concerns to our law enforcement officials and they assure me he is of the highest caliber
mills looks to a t
on a table picks up a remote increases the volume
on the screen martin talbot source of the voice stands before reporters
hes a powerful presence with a gold tooth in the front of his mouth
as district attorney dont you feel some responsibility
detective david mills lacks the experience
ive always said
ive always said dont send a boy to do a mans job
mills is hanging on every word
but david mills has a sterling record with the philadelphia force
i stand behind him one hundred percent
relieved you tell em boss
detective david mills is a wonderful human being
let me say this
mills looks back at the television
if detective mills at any point in this investigation
if he is not pulling his weight i will be the first in line to pull his plug
mills points the remote turns the t
off as reporters crowd talbot
mills stares at the blank screen dispirited
across the room tracy stands in the doorway
mills does not see her
he looks at the photocopy and sits at his desk
tracy watches him great concern in her sad eyes
somerset walks through this vast artists studio a converted warehouse space filled with canvases
its clear the works at the underground art gallery were williams
william climbs a ladder to a loft storage space
he moves cautiously like hes not quite up to the task
i always figured thats the only reason you and i used to be friends
because i was a friend of hers
william yanks a painting wrapped in dusty paper climbs down
speaking of which
william hands the painting to somerset walks to a directors chair facing a paint splashed canvas on an easel
he is a used up man bound in an apathy induced haze
he sits picks up a squeeze bottle of orange paint from a table of supplies
i painted that about five years ago
i always told myself id give it to you next time i saw you
somerset starts unwrapping the painting
william paints using the squeeze bottles and by flicking saturated brushes so that the paint flies against the canvas
most times hes not even looking at the canvas or colors hes using
he looks over his shoulder at somerset
things are different these days pal
you wouldnt believe it
somerset looks at the unwrapped painting and is hit by a swell of memories
horribly sad memories
its a portrait in oils of a pretty red headed woman
william shoots red paint with one hand concentrates on lighting a filterless cigarette with the other
people buy my paintings now
they drive down in their bmws and rolls royces
its the new money generation
i guess they think theyre touching the avant garde
william looks at his creation then calmly kicks the easel over
theres another thousand dollar william mccracken expression of anarchy
william gets up walks across the wet canvas leaving footprints
he looks down at what hes done
make that two thousand
somerset holds up the delicately rendered portrait
how is she
have you seen her recently
she moved out of the city
she married some businessman or something like that
somerset fights the anguish this causes puts the painting down
good for her
pause im leaving soon myself
im finally getting out
what happened to the idealistic super cop i used to know
he became a realist
william grunts flicks his cigarette away takes out a bag of pills
he palms a few notices the judgment in somersets eyes
william turns his back to somerset pops the pills
out of sight out of mind
somerset is disappointed disgusted
sarcastic not that i dont appreciate your recent artistic endeavors
but what happened to the painter i used to know
william smiles like a dolt laughs a little
i cant remember
color photos of the first and second murder sit on a drawing table
the top photos are like establishing shots each taking in the entire display the murderer created
william examines with somerset looking over his shoulder
can i buy these from you
theyre not for sale
somerset lays out photos of the notes triangle and circle what is it
whats the murderer trying to say
william narrows his eyes
does not know
what picture is he painting
figuring wait a minute
william has an idea
he ambles over to a row of cabinets where oversized art books are stacked
he hunts through a pile shoves some books aside
ive seen things like that
william keeps digging finds one book finds another
he opens one as he walks back to the drawing table
its church stuff
william lays a book down finds a page
he opens it to somerset
there is a circle to the side of the text
it says gluttony under the circle
somerset creases his brow turns the page
william opens another book
when it first started
christian artwork was all from bible stories
it was like
nobody had any imagination
it was all
william pages through and we catch glimpses of the bizarre worlds of hieronymus bosch
horrifying religious visions
but later everyone started painting to tell their own stories
to teach lessons
guys like bosch bregel the elder
william shoves the open book to somerset
somerset looks seven paintings in a circular pattern showing characters giving in to sins
wicked grotesque people
somerset turns the book to examine each painting right side up
the seven deadly sins
thats what these murders remind me of
paintings like these
envy wrath pride lust and sloth
seven deadly sins
william goes to continue pulling other books
i can find more examples
theres lots of paintings like those
painted over hundreds of years
moves books and youre right
that murderer is an artist
somerset is chilled by all this immersed in the bosch book
and its two down
five to go
a bright tawdry intersection
neon swirls and circuit bulbs on porno theatres provide the flash
cars taxies and barkers urging sexual indulgence from doorways provide the noise
the streets and sidewalks are crowded with lonely humans mostly men looking around sizing up promises made on porno placards fun with nudes big boobs naked desire etc
the usual contingent of abnormal cretins wanders in the crowd looking for someone to hurt
move through the crowds
meet john a balding middle aged man wearing thick glasses
there is not a single thing strange or unusual about his appearance
follow him as he walks
hes nervous looking at the porno palaces
his sweaty hand clutches a bible tight against his chest
he doesnt feel comfortable being here
john walks to a corner waits for the light so he may cross
a grotesque street preacher approaches waving his own bible
people walk away from him so he confronts john
are you sir
is jesus christ your lord and master
do you believe in him
john tries to ignore traffic blocking his escape
pleading dont ignore me
listen to what i have to say
christ can be your savior
quiet anger leave me alone
think about god sir
i can help you let him into your life
finally the light changes
john turns and spits in the preachers face
the preacher recoils as john crosses quickly
john hurries between cars in the crosswalk
the preacher curses from the corner his voice drowned out in traffic
people pass on the sidewalk
john is amongst them but he stops looking up at something offscreen
hes looking at a bright red storefront adorned with red neon the hot house
the hot houses barker notices johns interest
interesting isnt it friend
you like that you like girls then come on in
john doesnt hear the barker
steps up to study fading pictures of naked women massaging happy men
youll see a lot more inside
youll see a lot more than that
johns just looking his face bathed in bright red light the neon reflected in his thick glasses
somerset holding more than an armful of art books and novels pounds on the apartment door
tracy opens it with the chain on
can i help you
she takes a second to drink somerset in
somerset is surprised having expected mills
tracy is so exquisite that he falters
i was looking for mills
david i mean
hes not here right now
somerset tries not to drop any books while he digs up his badge
mills my name is somerset
if i could leave these books for him
undoes chain please come in
tracy leads somerset into the disarray of the apartment
david went for a walk
to clear his head
oh you can put those here
tracy motions and somerset puts the books on mills desk
he starts looking through one book checking paperclipped pages
could you tell him
tell him this is his reading assignment
ive marked the most important pages
would you like some coffee or a drink
david should be back any minute
i do have to get going
somerset sees a medal encased in glass on the desk amongst pens and pencils
he picks it up its a medal for valor from the philadelphia police department
at least i got to meet you
david has told me a lot about you
good things i hope
he said you were very smart
i think hes a bit intimidated by you
somerset thinks about this finds it hard to believe
he goes through his pocket pulls out a notepad and some paper scraps
im going to leave him a list of specifics
it all relates to the case hes on
he lays the various scraps and receipts aside on the desk sits to start writing on the notepad
tracy goes to the kitchenette to get a chair
you two arent working together anymore
isnt that so
to be perfectly honest mrs
david and i werent exactly what you could call fast friends
thats too bad
tracy brings the chair over by the desk and sits
somerset looks up from his writing
i doubt your husband shares that opinion
tracy nods leaning forward semi conspiratorially
you know somerset david is very
im sure youve seen its not likely hell ever be compared to gandhi
hes a good cop
he sees policework as a crusade
thats what he wants it to be and that might sound naive but hes made a conscious choice to be naive
pause believe me his hearts in the right place
somerset pauses enchanted by her
i hear you and he were high school sweethearts
pretty hokey huh
but what girl wouldnt want the captain of the football team as their lifelong mate
its rare these days
that kind of commitment
i guess so
tracys smile falters a bit
somerset notices this
he breaks from her spell turns to continue writing
this will only take a minute
take your time
tracy looks over the stack of books titles on the spines bosch a history of christian art bregel the elder etc
hardcover novels dantes purgatory and the tracy stands to look at the novels on top then sees the pile of paper scraps from somersets pocket
she picks up the piece of wallpaper with the pale red rose at its center
what is this
somerset looks up
sees her holding the paper rose
he takes it slightly self conscious looks at it
tracy tilts her head looking at somerset
you have a strange way about you somerset
i mean in a good way
somerset doesnt know what to say
he pockets the paper rose
ill get out of your hair
tracy stands takes the chair back to the kitchenette
its nice to hear a man who talks like that
if david saw that paper hed say youre acting like a homosexual
thats how he is
mock indignation well
i guess i wont be showing this to him then
i suppose not
somerset continues writing
tracy sits at the kitchenette table watches him
its raining hard
mills exits the morgue building with a few art books and a paper cup of coffee
he holds one art book over his head as he dashes through deep puddles in the street
mills gets in puts his coffee on the dash and tosses the art books in a box
he closes the door
alone with the sound of the rain
he wipes water off his face looks at his tired eyes in the rearview mirror
he reaches in the box of books takes out copies of the canterbury tales and dantes purgatory
he makes a face opens dantes purgatory vii the lustful vi the gluttonous v the avaricious and prodigal iv the slothful iii the wrathful ii the envious i the proud
mills turns to a bookmark rests the book on the steering wheel
he bites his lip leaning close to the words
he concentrates mouths some of the words to himself
he finally closes the book shaking his head not understanding anything hes reading
he starts pounding the book against the steering wheel with all his might
goddamn poetry writing freak mother fuck
a figure outside the window knocks on the glass
mills rolls it down
a cop in raincoat hands a wet paper bag through
good work officer
the cop leaves as mills quickly rolls the window up and rips the bag open
inside cliff notes for dantes purgatory and the canterbury tales
it still rains outside
somerset enters stops to notice detective mills painted on the door where his name used to be
he walks sees all his belongings have been moved from his desk and piled on a small temporary desk in the corner
somerset sits at the temporary desk starts organizing the files and papers
mills enters carrying the box of books
hows it coming
mills puts the box on the large desk
they both settle in attending to their work
two men about five feet apart each trying not to acknowledge the others presence
mills takes out his cliff notes looks to see somerset is occupied hides them in a desk drawer
somerset finishes one form flips it and looks up
theres a chalk board nailed to the wall
on the chalkboard gluttony x wrath greed x pride sloth lust envy the phone rings
both men look at it
phone rings again
its your name on the door
mills picks up
somerset returns to his work
into phone detective mills here
lowers voice honey i asked you not to call unless
mills is confused
he holds the phone out to somerset
its my wife
somerset looks quizzical
somerset takes it
into phone hello
listens yes well
i appreciate the thought but
listens well i guess id be delighted to
somerset gets up hangs up puzzled
mills is waiting
im invited to have a late supper with you and your wife
and i accept
sits back down tonight
mills looks at the phone lost
a record player on a moving box plays quiet music
theres a basketball game with no volume on the t
tracy mills and somerset eat at the kitchen table
mills has a beeper by his beer and occasionally fingers it absently
why arent you married somerset
what the hell
somerset adjusts his napkin on his lap thinking
i was close
it just didnt happen
it surprises me youre not married
it really does
any person who spends a significant amount of time with me finds me
just ask your husband
mills grins but he means it
he sips beer
the conversation lapses into long silence
somerset concentrates on his plate
tracy looks at mills who eats while watching the basketball game
to somerset how long have you lived here
much too long
drinks what do you think of our fair city
you take the bad with the good i suppose
it takes time to settle in
tracy looks at mills
somerset can see it is a sore subject
to tracy youll get used to it pretty quickly
there are things in any big city that stand out at first
a low rumbling is heard as plates begin to rattle and clatter
its right below us the dishes clatter more
coffee cups clink against their saucers
tracy holds her cup to stop it tries to act like it is nothing but she is clearly bothered
itll go away in a minute
picture goes fuzzy
the rumbling grows louder knocks something over in the sink
mills continues eating
somerset fiddles with his food
the record player skips then plays on
the rumbling finally dies down till everything is normal
uncomfortable this real estate guy
a real scum brought us to see this place a few times
and it was nice enough and the price was right
i was thinking it was nothing but i started to notice he kept hurrying us along
i mean what could it be
why would he only show it like five minutes at a time before hed hustle us out the door
mills laughs lamely
we found out the first night
somerset tries to stay straight but he cant help laughing
its a nice apartment
he pulls himself together but only for a moment
he cant stop it laughs harder covering his mouth
tracy and mills laugh
sighs oh fuck
the record player spins a different album different music
tracys clearing the last dishes into the sink
mills and somerset have beers
all television does is teach children that its really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day
i dont think ive ever met anyone who didnt have a television
tracy takes a pot of coffee to the table and pours
its un american
what about sports
what about them
tracy brings over a plate of cookies and puts it on the table
you go to movies at least
whats the last book you read mills
he turns to tracy
to somerset i just have to say i cant respect any man whos never seen green acres
somerset gives a blank stare
tracy walks away
youve never seen the odd couple
i vaguely recall wilma and someone named
across the room tracy turns the t
and the record player off
she goes into the bedroom shuts the door behind her without a word
somerset and mills turn to the closed door
they look at each other then sit for a time
somerset drinks coffee
mills drums his fingers on his beeper
mills walks up the creaky stairs
he carries his briefcase a six pack and art books
somerset follows reading a case file
we think he acted like he was delivering a package
the doorman at mr
golds building says he doesnt even look at anyone who goes in anymore
mills opens a door to the roof mills and somerset walk onto the roof
it is a spectacular view on all sides
miles of city lights
sounds of the city reach them
no connection between the two victims
mills shakes his head unloads what hes holding onto a rusty table
he sits in one of two lawn chairs
somerset sits across from him
no witnesses of any kind
which i cant understand
its like this guys invisible
in this city minding your own business is a perfected science
somerset takes a picture from the file the drawing of the sun with an eye at its center
he opens a book christian symbols which is full of illustrations
he starts paging through
at the precinct sunday nights they offer a public crime prevention course
and the very first thing they teach is that you should never scream help if youre in trouble
because people dont want to get caught up in anything
but a fire
they come running
somerset holds the books up to mills points to a picture of the sun and eye same as the drawing mills found
the sun in splendor with the eye
it refers to god the father and to saint thomas aquinas
which saint is he
aquinas wrote a summary of theology summa theologica
and he wrote about the seven deadly sins
mills takes the book and looks it over
now what else have you got
look i appreciate being able to talk this out but
its my case
satisfying my curiosity
im still leaving town on sunday
mills is pondering very tired
he unlatches his briefcase takes a photocopy of the photo of the falsely pretty woman and hands it to somerset
the eyes were circled
this is his wife
nods she was away on business
she got back the day he was killed
if this means she saw anything i dont know what
weve questioned her about ten times
and if its a threat
we put her in a safe house
this is the one thing
two twenty story tenement buildings stand practically underneath the span of a bridge
the streets are littered with garbage
teenagers stand in cliques in front of a liquor store
cars pass slowly car stereos pumping out hip hop
under the bridge in shadow a car is parked between two dumpsters
the trunk is open
the trunk is full of cardboard boxes which are in turn full of tall orange candles
hundreds of candles
john leans in under the trunks bulb opens a leather pouch and checks the contents a plastic bottle of prescription pills
a bottle of aspirin
a hypodermic needle filled with liquid
lastly many jars of baby food strained carrots strained spinach creamed corn etc
john climbs the stairs holding the leather case and a closed shoebox
he wears clip on sunglasses a hat pulled low a thin overcoat on his plump body
john comes from the stairwell door looks walks up the hall
the walls are graffitied
the soiled floor is wet in spots
arguments and loud children are heard from behind closed doors
john comes to apartment
hes winded from the climb
he takes out keys lets himself in
closes the door
somerset stands at the edge holding the photo of mrs
he puffs on a cigarette looks out at the city lights
its like hes preaching
pause the sins were used in medieval sermons
there were seven cardinal virtues and then seven deadly sins as a learning tool
the sins distract man from true worship
mills is seated at the table with art books open
a breeze fans the pages of the books
the flipping pages reveal views of heaven hell adoration crucifixion and sin
like in these paintings and in dantes purgatory right
but in purgatory dante and his buddy climb that big mountain
seven terraces of purgation
pride comes first not gluttony
and in all the paintings the sins are in a different order
i cant find a pattern
because theres creativity in the mix
consider these books as the murderers inspiration
somerset drops his cigarette to the empty street watching the glowing tip fall
he looks at the womans circled eyes
he sees himself contributing to the body of christian work
hes punishing these people
for all of us to see and learn from
these murders are like forced attrition
when you regret your sins but not because you love god
because someones holding a gun on you
he walks from the edge to mills
golds wife found the body about how long was she in the apartment
she didnt find it
the door to the apartment was open and a neighbor
i thought you said she found the body
when she got back from a business trip
she got back after you and i had already been there
somerset thinks coming up with something
somerset holds up the photo of mrs
maybe she is supposed to see something
she just hasnt had a chance to see it yet
the room is like a bland hotel room
mills stands beside mrs gold
he shows her photos from the murder scene
gold is crying
somerset stands across the room
please look for anything strange or out of place
anything at all
i dont understand
mills helps her go through the photos
he is shaken himself not wanting to put her through this
i need your help if were going to get the guy who killed your husband
if theres anything in these pictures
gold sobs quietly wipes her tears
i dont see anything
are you absolutely sure
i cant do this now
ette to the empty street watching the glowing tip fall
he looks at the womans circled eyes
he sees himself contributing to the body of christian work
hes punishing these people
for all of us to see and learn from
these murders are like forced attrition
when you regret your sins but not because you love god
because someones holding a gun on you
he walks from the edge to mills
golds wife found the body about how long was she in the apartment

he is shaken himself not wanting to put her through this
i need your help if were going to get the guy who killed your husband

gold sobs quietly wipes her tears
i dont see anything
are you absolutely sure
i cant do this now
mills looks at somerset
somerset holds other photos
we have to show her those
there might be something shes missing
somerset looks at the photos in his hand hesitant
these photos show mr
golds corpse not covered in any way
have her look one last time
what is it
gold points at the constructivist painting on the wall in one photo
the painting is an abstraction of colored squares
in the living room
why is it hanging upside down
mills jerks his head to look at somerset
this is where the greed murder took place
somerset and mills are taking the constructivist painting off the wall
nothing on the wall behind the painting
this has got to be it
somerset puts the painting down resting it on its bottom edge
the frame is backed by a thick sheet of brown paper
he points to where the wire used to be screwed into the frame and to where it has been re screwed
it has to be
he changed the wire to rehang it
somerset tears along the edge of the brown paper to get to the space between it and the canvas
he tears out the entire sheet
mills helps pull it away but theres nothing there
mills looks at both sides of the paper then tosses it away
somerset pays the painting down face up
he pokes his finger on the painted surface
mills watches as somerset kneels takes out a credit card and presses its edge against the canvas trying to peel up some of the paint
give it up
the killer didnt paint the fucking thing
somerset pushes the painting away stands frustrated
he fucked us
somerset backs away from the wall staring at the space where the painting hung
there is only a nail
he stares intently then turns and walks out of the room
mills holds his hands to his temples furious
somerset can be heard from the other room going through drawers dropping things
glass is heard breaking
mills grabs a lamp and throws it on the floor
son of a bitch
somerset comes back in holding something
he steps over the lamp and goes to the blank wall space
bear with me
somerset has a womans make up compact in hand
he opens it uses the soft brush to begin applying the red rouge powder to the wall around the nail
incredulous oh yeah sure
you got to be kidding
shut up and wait
somerset brushes with wider strokes
he blows leans very close to the wall to study the powder
leans closer still
call the print lab
tracy is asleep with lights on
she stirs opens her eyes
tracy opens the door enters
she sees mills and somerset are gone
shes all alone
through the window we can see into the bedroom
tracy comes back from the living room
she goes to her side of the bed kneels
she reaches between the mattress and bedspring takes out a paperback book she has hidden there
she comes to the window opens it and climbs out onto the fire escape
she sits dangles her feet through the metal bars
she opens the book and tries to read by the street light resting her head against the railing
a woman is heard screaming distantly
tracy looks down the empty street unsettled
the woman is not heard again
tracy lays back looks at the sky holding herself
we can now see the title of the book preparing for parenthood
there is a picture of a baby on the cover
tracy cries quietly
a male forensic uses a magnifying glass to study a very clear fingerprint in black powder on the wall
talk to me
the forensic bites his lip still studying
mills and somerset watch the forensic who works offscreen
to somerset listen honestly
have you ever seen anything like this
been involved in anything remotely like this
i have not
well i can tell you this detectives
the forensic steps down from a stool
behind him where the painting once was there are fingerprints clear and distinct
the prints have been left side by side to form letters which form the words help me
just by studying the underloop
these are not the victims prints
a technician sits before an old computer
the computers green screen shows fingerprints being aligned compared and then rejected whir click whir click whir click
mills and somerset watch bathed in the green glow
it doesnt work for me
i cant believe he wants us to help him stop
who the hell knows
theres plenty of schizoids out there doing dirty deeds they dont want to do
with tiny voices whispering nasty things in their ears
somerset doesnt buy it
the technician adjusts a knob
ive seen this baby take three days to finish a cycle so you guys can go cross your fingers somewhere else
somerset and mills come from the print lab
a janitor is mopping the hall
the computer is heard whirring and clicking onwards
somerset sits with a groan on a couch outside the door
mills flops beside him
you really meant what you said to mrs
you really believe well get him dont you
and you dont
i wish i still thought like you
im so far gone from that
so tell me what you think were doing
all we do is pick up the pieces
we take all the evidence
all the pictures statements
write everything down and note what time things happened
we take it all make a nice neat pile and file it away
just in case its ever needed in a courtroom
in my entire life youre the oldest man ive ever met
ive seen even the most promising clues lead to dead ends
hundreds of times
ive seen the same
im not the country hick boy you seem to think i am
somerset takes out a cigarette and lights it
in this city if all the skeletons came out of all the closets
if every un revenged corpse were to suddenly rise and walk again there would be no more room for the living
mills slumps back crosses his arms closes his eyes to sleep
dont try to tell me you didnt get that rush tonight
like we were getting somewhere
pause and dont try to tell me it was because you thought we found something that would play well in a courtroom
somerset looks at mills puffs the cigarette
the computer is heard whir click whir click
our detectives are fast asleep on the couch leaning against each other
people pass and look at them strangely
wake up glimmer twins
we have a winner
a windowless classroom
the captain stands in front with a white screen at his side
the face of a black man zero is projected on the screen from a slide projector
his street name is zero as some of you know
his prints were found at the scene by detectives mills and somerset
five hardened police officers four men one woman sit in chairs facing the captain
they all wear bullet proof vests with police stencil painted across them
somerset and mills sit in back drinking coffee still trying to wake up
now zero has a long long history of mental illness
he was all over your television sets two years ago after he raped and killed a seventy three year old woman
he got off as the saying goes on a technicality
so we watched him on the streets and he went out of circulation about a year ago
if he disappeared what do you want from us
his last place of residence is still in his name
a search warrant is being pushed through the court as we speak
a red headed cop california raises his meaty hand
so have the housing cops walk up and ring the doorbell
the cops laugh
the captain clenches his jaw
when you go in if zero isnt home some of his buddies might be house sitting
and besides using zero deals so you will be very uninvited guests
there is chatter among the cops
somerset leans to mills while the captain continues the briefing
does not seem like our killer does it
you tell me
im new in town
zero does possess the requisite degree of insanity
but he doesnt have the desire somehow
our killer seems to have more purpose
more purpose than zero could ever conceive of
well tag along
somerset wants no part of that
why would we
satisfy our curiosity
mills drives follows a police van
somerset rides shotgun
mills is pumped ready
somerset takes one rolaids tablet off a fresh roll and chews it
you ever take one
somerset pulls out his gun checks the load
never in twenty four years
i took my gun out only five times with the actual intention of using it
i never fired it
i pulled it once fired it once
i never took a bullet
mills turns a corner tires screeching
it was my first one of these
we were a secondary unit in vice
i was pretty shaky going in
when we busted the door looking for a junkie the fucking guy opened fire
one cop was hit in the arm
he went flying
like in slow motion
pause i remember riding in the ambulance
his arm was like
a piece of meat
i thought its just his arm
but he bled to death right there anyway
somerset opens the window feels the air on his face
how did the fire fight end
well i was doing really good in philly up till then
lots of simple busts
ive always had this weird luck
but this was wild
pause i got that fuck with one shot
right between the eyes
and the next week the mayors pinning a medal on me
picture in the paper the whole nine yards
how was it
i expected it to be bad because i heard about other guys
i took a human life
but i slept like a baby that night
somerset eats another antacid
i think hemingway wrote somewhere
i cant remember where but he wrote that in order to live in a city you have to have the ability to kill
i think he meant you truly must be able to do it not just faking it to survive
sounds like he knew what he was talking about
crack vials and hypodermic needles crunch under heavy boots
the five cops from the briefing fully geared up rifles and handguns held move quickly up the stairs single file
somerset and mills follow guns out
somerset is sweating bullets
mills is juiced
the cops enter the dank hallway the same hall we saw john in before
they move cautiously stepping over a drunken helpless man
a door opens and a woman peeks out
the female cop points her gun and the woman obeys slamming the door
california leads steps up to apartment
he has a search warrant scotch taped to the front of his bullet proof vest
to black cop this is it
give it up
a black cop hoists a battering ram
the other cops get on both sides of the door
mills moves front
somerset hangs back
open the door
the black cop brings the ram forward with a splintering thud
the door flies open
the cops storm in
the cops charge down a short hall into this incredibly dusty room
a bed sits against a far wall
mills and california move up to the bed
someone lies under an indigo blanket
three other cops move training their weapons on the bed
good morning sweetheart
a blond cop goes into another room
mills kicks the bed
get up now motherfucker
the blond cop enters gun trained looks around in confusion
the rooms tables chairs and floor are covered with hundreds of colorful plastic air fresheners
somerset moves in looks around
he notices the area around the bed the ceiling walls and floor has been painted indigo while the rest of the room is its original white
on a wall a white sheet is pinned up with a square drawn on it in excrement
i said get up sleepyhead
mills pulls the indigo blanket off the bed reveals the shriveled sore covered form of a black man who is blindfolded and tied to the bed with a thin wire
wrapped time and time again around the bed
tubes lead from the stained loincloth around the mans waist and snake under the bed
the victim is partially covered by what seem to be piles of black spaghetti
oh fuck me
somerset pushes past the cops who recoil from the stench
the black cop touches the black spaghetti
holds a piece
what the hell
those are dead worms
to somerset check this out dick
california points with his gun to the end of the black mans right arm
the hand is gone severed at the wrist long ago
someone call an ambulance
someone call a hearse more like
the female cop has gone to the wall where the sheet is pinned up
she pulls the sheet aside and finds fifty two polaroid pictures all pictures of zero tied to the bed with a date written at the bottom of each
it is a visual history of zeros physical decay
the blond cop enters from the other room
what the fuck is going on
get your people out
somerset takes out rubber gloves and puts them on
you heard him
hit the hall and dont touch anything
the other cops file out as mills goes to examine the polaroids under the sheet
somerset replaces the sheet over zeros body
california stays by his side
it looks like hes some kind of friggin wax sculpture
somerset places his finger along zeros throat
you better look here
mills studies the polaroids
somerset walks to join him
all pictures of zero tied to the bed
crouches the last ones dated three days ago
somerset looks at the first photo
in it zero is bound and gagged but he is fit healthy
awed the first photo
its dated one year ago
almost to the day
california lifts zeros blanket to peek under examining with morbid curiosity
mills kneels and lifts the bottom of the sheet off the floor finds an open shoebox
on the box to the detectives
california leans close to zeros gaunt blindfolded face
you got what you deserved zero
somerset leans down beside mills
mills looks through the shoebox
inside are plastic zip lock bags
one bag contains small clumps of hair one contains a yellow liquid
a urine sample
hes laughing at us
california is still close to zeros face when suddenly zeros lips twist
zero lets out a loud guttural bark
california jerks back in fear shouting falling over a chair
mills and somerset reel standing
they see california on the ground scared out of his mind pointing
mills and somerset look towards the bed
zeros lips move feebly as he lets out a sick gurgling moan
hes still alive
a crowd has gathered
mills car the police van and two ambulances are parked on the sidewalk
the siege cops are in the hall holding neighbors at bay
three ambulance attendants are at the bed working on zero
one attendant uses wire cutters to clip zeros bonds
mills and somerset stand in the middle of one flight of stairs
they are both highly agitated
the way this has gone i didnt think it was possible but we may have underestimated this guy
the type of intestinal fortitude it must take
to keep a man bound for a full year
to sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints
i want him bad
i dont just want to catch him anymore
i want to hurt him
we have to divorce ourselves from our emotions here
we have to keep focusing on the small details
i dont know about you somerset but i feed off my emotions
hell string us along all the way if were not careful
mills is looking at the floor burning with anger
somerset grabs him by the jacket
are you listening to me
mills pushes somersets hand off
i hear you
there is a sudden brilliant flash of light and the sound of a camera advancing
mills and somerset look down the stairs john is posing as a reporter
he has his camera and flash up pointed at the detectives
he takes another picture flashbulb flashing
mills charges downwards grabs john by his wrinkled clothing
what the fuck are you doing
john squirms holds up a laminated press identification pass
i have a right officer
mills shoves him and john stumbles a few steps then falls to the landing below with a thud
his glasses fly off
that doesnt mean anything
this is a closed crime scene now
somerset steps down and pulls mills back
you cant do this
get the fuck out of here
john gets his glasses scrambles downstairs out of sight
the public has a right to know
somerset yanks mills harder till mills sits on the stairs
how do those cockroaches get here so quick
they pay cops for the inside scoop and they pay well
you can hate them but you better give them something or theyll make it all up
calming im sorry
oh its alright
its always impressive to see a man feeding off his emotions
mills stands with the blase dr
beardsley who reviews a medical chart on a clipboard
zero lies inside an oxygen tent with tubes running into him
the room is dark
a year of immobility seems about right judging by the deterioration of the muscles and spinal cord
blood tests show a whole smorgasbord of drugs in his system
even an antibiotic which was administered to keep the bed sores from infecting
mills looks into the oxygen
he hasnt said anything or tried to express himself in any way
even if his brain were not mush which it is
he chewed his own tongue off a long time ago
mills winces moves away from the bed
theres no way hell survive
detective hed die right now of shock if you were to shine a flashlight in his eyes
a tall church on a bustling street
smoggy air has eaten at the stonework
the homeless are camped out on the stairs
the priests accommodations are quite spacious and comfortable
the parishs wealth is evident
father bleeker stands looking at several by glossies
hes dressed in his civilian clothing wears his hair short and proper
these photos are making him heartsick
bleeker hands them to somerset who is seated by a fireplace
put them away
i wish you hadnt brought them into the church
i needed for you to see them
father bleeker shakes his head as if he were trying to forget the images
somerset replaces the murder photos in a file
there were five principal phases in the development of early christian art
from hellenistic through the renaissance
each period was affected by the decrees of religious leaders
if this killer belongs to a certain branch of the church
if he collects religious art from a certain period i want to know
i have to narrow it down
bleeker walks to an ornate gold cabinet
he puts on a pair of cotton gloves
the influences on these
things hes done couldnt have come before the gothic period
whats in those pictures is presented far too asymmetrically
bleeker crosses himself before using a key to open the cabinet
he takes out an ancient devotional book and a piece of cloth
the colors will tell the tale
bleeker takes the book to a table
bleeker lays the cloth under the book opens the book tenderly
each sin had a symbolic color
but the specific color designations changed throughout the ages
somerset leans to examine bleekers illuminated manuscript two pages of prayer
the prose is elaborately formed surrounded by colorful illustrations of the seven deadly sins
bleekers finger points to a rendering of a man seated on a rock guzzling from a jug
its been painted in orange
this is an example
gluttony is the sin and the color is orange
this particular manuscript is preserved from the th century
in the murders gluttony is green
greed is yellow
sloth is indigo
bleeker steps away and somerset gets closer to the pages
so if this murderer is as precise as you say then you need to find out at what period in history was gluttony green
and so on
where do i look
if the colors changed so often
contemplates there is one man
pause i havent heard from him for quite some time
this was his passion
he spent his life studying the sins
and preaching against them
the chalkboard on the wall gluttony x wrath greed x pride sloth x lust envy mills is behind his paperwork covered desk listening to a uniformed officer who looks over
a report sheet
zeros landlord said an envelope of cash was in the office mailbox each month
he says quote i never heard a single complaint from this guy and nobody ever complained about him
hes the best tenant i ever had
theres a landlords dream tenant
a paralyzed man with no tongue
who pays his rent on time
bring me everything as soon as its transcribed
the officer leaves
mills starts sorting through piles on his desk
he doesnt know where to begin
he sits back in his chair looks at the collage like collection of pictures pinned on the walls photos and diagrams of the murder scenes the drawing of the sun
and eye color pages and black and white copies of pages from art books
he stares thinking
he stands takes a photocopy off the wall
the killers first note dear detectives long is the way and hard that out of hell leads up to the light
to himself milton
big brass lamps hang from the high ceiling
mahogany chairs and tables run down the center floor which is bordered by three levels of balconies
people wander like ants in an ant farm
mills walks taking it all in
he goes to the circulation desk
impatient patrons wait in a long line
he watches the bored head librarian female help an old man at the desk
she opens the old mans books runs a laser pen over a bar code sticker pushes a few buttons on a computer
near the balcony railing overlooking the main floor mills sits before a computer card catalog
he reads the computer screen unsure
he sets down his pad and pencil cracks his knuckles begins typing on the keyboard
the computer gives off a quiet beep
pleased mills reads the screen
on the screen title paradise lost he hits return
reads the screen as information on the book appears
he copies it on his pad puts the pencil in his mouth
on the screen subject jack the ripper hits return
again he copies info from the screen
a monk opens a formidable gateway door letting father bleeker and somerset into a garden courtyard
bleeker now wears his priestly garb and collar
the monasterys main building looms at the end of a pathway
the building is stately ivy covered
father stone had a church and congregation of his own
there were some problems
the church is deserted now
bleeker continues walking
the walls of the hallway are carved with images of saints
bleeker whispers to somerset beside a windowless door
there was a small orphanage attached to the church overseen by father stone
this was almost thirty years ago
hesitant he was an excellent priest devoted in every way
many in his parish demanded his return
tell me what happened
bleeker sees a nun down the hall coming towards them
allegations were made
stone was accused of abusing the children in his care
but those charges were never substantiated
it was claimed
that the children were beaten
and punished severely
the nun is too close for bleeker to speak freely
the door is unlocked and opened by the nun
somerset enters and bleeker waits outside as the nun closes the door
father stone is in a wheelchair
feeble and frail eyes sunken in their sockets
he looks up at somerset
im a policeman
id like to ask you a few questions if its alright
the whites of stones eyes have yellowed
he seems to nod
somerset sits on a stool close
i want to ask you about the seven deadly sins
stone reaches out a hand to touch somersets face
stones extremely long fingernails trail against somersets cheek and somerset tries to hide his revulsion
are you one of mine
are you saved
do you have god
i need to ask about the sins
do you understand what im saying
stone takes his hand away seems to be getting angry
are you a sinner
stones weak arms wheel him away towards a corner
there are sinners here
and pain waits for them
hell is hungry for them
stone bites his lip moaning disoriented
they dont realize
they dont know
pause fuck them all
somerset is shocked by the strength and volume of stones jagged voice
the nun goes to place a comforting hand on stones shoulder
stone is beginning to cry
to somerset they shouldnt have let you disturb him
this shouldnt have been allowed
where are the children
much louder where are the children
from a mahogany hallway lined with book carts we look through a big window into the head librarians office
the elderly head librarian is at a computer chain smoking working the keyboard
mills alternates talking on the telephone and reading things off his pad to the librarian
we cannot hear them but its clear mills is excited as he walks back and forth hovering over the librarian looking at her computer screen making suggestions then walking to
monitor a dot matrix printer which spews a waterfall of computer paper onto the floor
back and forth goes mills carrying the phone
he closes the pad puts it in his pocket
the librarian finishes typing sits back done
mills hangs up the phone goes to put it on the librarians desk but the cord drags knocks a pile of books off a table
the librarian is irritated goes to pick up the books
mills is apologizing
he goes to watch the printer
he tears the last sheets perforated edge gathers the huge pile of printed paper off the floor
prize in hand mills is so grateful he bends to give the old woman a kiss on the cheek but she pushes him away now even more annoyed
mills goes to leave knocks over another pile of books
before he can assist the angry librarian points to the door
mills obeys like a scolded child exits
the librarian shakes her head in disgust
a once exemplary church now boarded up neglected
gothic in style it stands with deserted brownstones and empty lots of rubble as neighbors
smokestacks spew smoke distantly
cars and trucks drive by on a nearby elevated highway but down here on the street its a ghost town
theres a building attached to the rear of the church
somersets car is parked beside it
the windows are covered over
somerset and father bleeker move through
somerset has a flashlight with a wide beam
the room is empty except for broken cob web covered school desks and a few file cabinets
there are cracked blackboards on the walls
rats skitter away from the light
somerset opens a file cabinet drawer
he walks to a door starts pulling at the rotting boards which seal it shut
what are you looking for
im just looking
somerset pushes the door
he and bleeker enter from the classroom into the far back corner of the church
shafts of colored light needle through the holes in the pieces of wood and cloth that cover the broken stained glass windows
somerset walks down the center aisle between deteriorated pews
pigeons flap about dirt drifting off their wings
somerset shines his flashlight forward to the rather barren altar
to the right at the top of the altar stairs there is a stone statue of a saint with his arms outstretched welcoming
the life size saint is covered in spider webs
tiny spiders crawl across his eyes which look down on somerset
saint jerome emiliani
the patron saint of orphans
somerset shines the flashlight against the back altar wall revealing a wooden carving of christ crucified
is this still the lords house
of course it is
and even if father stone was guilty of everything
if he was hurting children here
its still the lords house
father bleeker finds this talk insulting and offensive
you have no faith somerset
have you given up on the church entirely
pause thats not what ive given up on
somerset notices two ends of a thick rope suspended from the ceiling above the center of the altar
he looks up following the rope with the flashlight when he notices something else
his mouth drops
bleeker looks and is equally horrified
above them in the beam of light seven large paintings on panels tilted forward at the curve of the ceiling above the altar
seven ancient paintings seven deadly sins
the beam of light moves to the panel to the immediate right a painting of a man kneeling grasping at gold coins all around him
the man is naked as was the victim of the greed murder
the chief color in this panel is a vulgar yellow
the third in the series is sloth
the painting in indigo shows a man at rest in a pliant bed
the skeletal mans eyes are rolled up in their sockets
he is covered in slimy worms
the streets are full of patrol cars
cops and forensics enter and exit the church from various doorways
saw horses are loaded off a flat bed truck as a police barricade is erected
much activity as forensics with flashlights go about their business checking every nook and cranny of the church looking for any sign that someones been here recently
small temporary floodlights are hoisted on tripods
two photographers stand at the tops of tall ladders
flash photo after flash photo is taken of the seven paneled tableau
near the open church doors mills speaks with great animation holding his ream of computer paper
somerset looks at the altar and the tableau preoccupied
our guys a bookworm right
and i know its a long shot but you have to give a picture id and current phone bill to get a library card
mills snaps his fingers in somersets face gets his attention
i made two separate lists of books
one relating to the sins
dantes purgatory canterbury tales
the dictionary of catholicism
all the religious stuff
the second list was books about torture methods mass murderers
whatever our killer might study to do the things hes done
whatever his other interests are
somerset takes the computer list
so what is this
everything at the library goes into a computer
so you can get in the system and cross reference
mills fumbles in his pocket takes out his pad and reads
lets say you take dantes purgatory call number eight five one d and
the biography of the marquis de sade ninety two s a d e
put those books in the system and the computer can give you the name of anyone whos ever taken out both those books
and it doesnt just give you their name and address it gives you a complete history of their library reading habits
mills slaps the list in somersets hand
psyched up if somebodys out there reading paradise lost and studying the life and times of charlie manson i want to talk to them
somerset looks up from the list warming to it
he starts looking around searching for someone
somerset and mills exit down the stairs
somersets still searching holding the list
he spies a uniformed cop dario
dario runs up
somerset puts his hand on his shoulder and makes him walk with him
mills continues on to his car
according to the father this orphanage wasnt around for more than five or six years in the late fifties
so i want someone to go to the department of child welfare or city hall and dig up all the records on this place
i got it
get a list of every child who attended this orphanage before it shut down
get it on my desk within the hour
somerset releases dario who runs to obey
somerset goes to his own car
mills is driving to leave stops revs the engine
somerset hands the computer list through the window
you thought of this all by yourself
this was your brainstorm
is that so hard for you to believe
its a pleasant surprise
im not as stupid as i look
mills peels away
somerset heads to his own car
to himself i guess not
seven large photos hang with the other materials on the wall the seven tableau paintings
gluttony greed and sloth followed by vanity
vanity shows a woman standing in front of a mirror staring at her image
the floor around her is scattered with flowers
the primary color is violet and as in all the paintings there is a quality of ugliness in the character
i dont see any ramirez
the lust painting is next
it shows a man standing over a woman
the woman is nude under a sheet and the mans features are bizarre lecherous
he wants that woman
there are apples on the floor and on the bed
the color is red
envy is particularly gruesome
the devil is seen hovering in the air wearing a crown his body orange and slick wrapped in a cloak of flames
his arms held high his right hand grips a sword a bolt of lightning arrows wheat thistles etc
his left hand holds a plain globe around which a serpent has wrapped itself
he looks down at several pitiful mortals in a pit of fire
the mortals reach for him yearn for him the skin on their bodies is stretched taut over their bones
wrath shows a man surrounded by vaporous satanic demons
he stands in a puddle of blood looking at his hands stained with and dripping blood
other than the rich red the color is blue
mills is at his desk a good portion of the print out list draped to the floor
he rubs his eyes sighing gets back to it
somerset at the temporary desk studies his orphan list
okay here we go
listen to the books this guys been taking out
reading list basic homicide investigation
the encyclopedia of modern serial killers
looks up excited of human bondage thats not what you think it is
mills is disappointed runs his finger further down the page
reading list the writings of saint thomas aquinas
mills points to the drawing of the sun in splendor with the eye which hangs on the wall
let me have it
mills looks at the page
he used a false name
how do you know
his library card lists him as jonathan doe
mills sits back angry
something strikes somerset as odd
he starts leafing quickly through the orphanage list
somerset finds what hes looking for
its like a sick joke
what are you talking about
there is one boy here
he was abandoned
no one knew who his parents were so he was named at the orphanage
looks at mills john doe
its his legal name
somerset and mills climb stairs turn a corner into this hall
its impossible odds that this is him
i know i know
on one little thing
im not complaining
ill follow anything we get and ill take it any way we can get it
well look at him
ask a few questions
try to get a feeling whether we should keep tabs on him
they reach a door apartment a
mills takes out his gun and looks at somerset to ask what do you think
somerset nods that he should have the gun ready
mills steps to the side of the door knocks hard
quietly ill do the talking right
let me practice here
um excuse me mr
doe but are you by any chance a serial killer
oh you are
well come with us then if you dont mind
mills smiles at his own wit
a stair is heard creaking offscreen
mills turns to look towards the stairs
a male figure stands at the top of the stairs wearing a hat standing in shadows
the man looks at them lets out a scream of horror and reaches into his coat
gunfire sounds and a bullet slams into door a behind mills
he and somerset recoil in shock going to the floor as another bullet explodes blasting plaster off the wall
the man is heard running back down the stairs
jesus christ we can get this fucker
mills jumps up
he moves towards the railing
somerset sits up and takes out his own gun
the stairwell is silent
mills peers over the railing into the stairwells center gun pointed
a heavy metallic click is heard
mills leaps backwards as bullets begin raining up from below accompanied by the sound of an uzi sub machine gun firing
somerset lays flat as he and mills crawl away from the railing which is being shredded along with the floor around it
bullets soar unceasingly
mills and somerset hold their hands over their ears
pieces of wood and plaster fly everywhere
the uzi stops and the man can be heard running again
mills gets up covered in debris
he runs down into the smoky stairwell
somerset rolls over gets up more slowly
mills rushes out into this weedy overgrown courtyard
he sees a thin vagrant sleeping on the buildings junk pile then looks all directions
his eyes are wild
his gun hand is shaking
the courtyard is surrounded by alleyways
the shooter could have gone anywhere and is nowhere in sight
somerset comes out face wet with sweat
mills holsters his gun
are you alright
are you okay
i think so
they look at each other for a long time
both realizing they came very close to dying
police cars on scene
curious civilians have gathered
up the stairwell several forensics are collecting shell casings putting them in bags
the casings are scattered all the way up the stairs
one forensic walks up beside a cop
i hear hes running around with an uzi in one hand and a book of poetry in the other
a real modern day renaissance man huh
at the top of the stairs two forensics sarah and billy wait behind mills and somerset
surgical gloves on all hands
mills kicks at the door to apartment a with all his might
boom door flies open
mills enters with somerset
to forensics give us first crack at it
sarah and billy wait in the hall
somerset hits a switch on the wall and a lamp illuminates on a desk
the desk is in the center of the room facing them
the walls floor to ceiling are covered with visual stimuli pictures paintings newspaper articles sketches writings on napkins and notebook sheets etc
mostly religious images
the far wall is made of shelves full of books
mills goes to the desk while somerset goes to the books
books an overview of theology handbook of firearms a history of the world summa theologica u
criminal law review etc
mills looks at the desktop
the surface is marked by dried oil colors
there are tubes of paint laying out boxes of water colors and pastels
mills looks at one corner of the desk
an orange candle has been allowed to burn down
the wax trail goes all the way down the edge of the desk to a puddle on the floor
somerset walks studying one wall of pin ups
there are articles about the seven deadly sins pages from art books pencil drawings of satan and christ and drawings of the seven paneled tableau paintings which inspired the murders
somerset lifts several sheets to note the paper scraps are spaced so tightly and completely that they cover the window
at the desk mills opens the top middle drawer
its empty except for the holy bible
he opens another drawer which is filled with at least forty empty aspirin bottles
somerset looks at a door which is papered over by all the newspaper articles and photographs about the seven deadly sin murders
he opens the door somerset enters
the ceiling light is on
there are bookshelves on each wall filled with thousands of notebooks
somerset takes one notebook down
it is a thick composition book with a marbled black and white cover
inside the pages are covered in small handwritten sentences and drawings
somerset takes down another notebook and opens it
same as the first scribbled sentences and sketches
he walks to another wall pulls another notebook
mills opens a final drawer to find a rosary and a revolver
he looks around nervous and excited being in the murderers lair
he goes to a closed door across the room notices john does bed in the corner
sees doe has a cross nailed to the ceiling directly above the beds pillow
mills enters the bathroom
it has been converted into a darkroom lit by red bulbs with strips of film hanging from the ceiling
water is heard dripping
mills opens the shower curtain
prints hang drying clipped to wires over the tub
somerset enters from the room of notebooks
this is john does art studio
windowless with several easels holding paintings in various states of completion
the walls are covered with photos and finished canvases except for one wall which is blank white
somerset turns the lights off
there is a mm film projector on a table facing the blank wall
somerset turns the projector on
it clatters to life running a piece of film
the film is spliced into a non stop loop
somerset watches the wall light strobing across him
the projector shows an image of clouds drifting with strange superimposed angels in flowing robes floating jerkily
its like an old hollywood version of heaven
the image switches abruptly to fire and tormented souls laboring around a pit of molten goo
like heaven its a scratched piece of film from hollywoods early days
somerset turns to examine one of the paintings on an easel
the painting has been skillfully rendered in small controlled brush strokes
it shows a modern city street stylized dark
the city is peopled by mutated humans and freakish beasts
sinners in the streets killing raping pillaging
buildings are burning blood is being spilled
its dense with detail
somerset walks to another painting which is covered by a drop cloth
he removes the cloth uncovers a huge canvas
we do not see the painting but when somerset does his features turn grim
mills enters tormented weary
he stands in the projectors bright beam holds an by print
somerset we had him
he hands a press pass and the photo to somerset
the pass is a fake
we had him
somerset looks at the photo a picture of mills and somerset on the stairwell of the slum apartment building the picture john took when he posed as a reporter
we were that close to him
somerset motions to the huge canvas
mills looks the painting is frightening collage thick with paint
the photo of mills and somerset has been incorporated in bits and pieces
duplicate images enlarged eyes hands faces
the faces have been ripped scratched mutilated
grainy eyes with holes jabbed in them are mounted in paint beside chopped broken arms
mills head is on somersets body and vice versa
its like a sick fragmented vision of a slaughter house floor
a block of burnt out row homes and warehouses
stray wild dogs roam in a pack
a car turns down this street
its john does car moving fast
its headlights go out and it cruises avoiding garbage cans in the street
follow the dark car
ahead a few blocks away we can see the only lights in this neighborhood the flashing reds whites and blues of police activity
john doe brings the car to a stop
he watches the police at work around the abandoned church
he gives no discernable reaction puts the car in reverse
he looks behind as he drives back the way he came
the refrigerator door is open
a male forensic uses tongs to remove zeros severed hand from behind soda cans and mayonnaise
the forensic walks through with the hand in a clear plastic bag past a female sketch artist who puts the finishing touches on a fairly accurate drawing of the balding
this is the guy
mills stands over the artist
sarah billy and two deputy detectives are at work in the room photographing searching
make sure it gets around
you got it
tomorrow morning this citys good citizens will be on the lookout for elmer fudd
to mills we cant find anything to hang onto
no pay stubs no appointment books or calendars
not even a book of phone numbers
and youre not going to believe this
we havent found any fingerprints yet
you know youre right
i dont believe it
somerset reads one of does notebooks
three cops are looking through other notebooks from the shelves
we need to put more men on this
im working on it alright
what have we got
somerset bristles slightly at mills abrupt demeanor
weve got about five thousand notebooks in this room
and as near as i can tell each notebook contains two hundred and fifty pages
then he must write about the murders
somerset looks at the notebook reads
what sick silly puppets we are and what a gross stage we dance on
what fun we have dancing around not a care in the world
not knowing that we are nothing
we are not what god intended
turns pages on the subway today a man came up to start a conversation
he was making small talk this lonely man talking about the weather and other things
i tried to be accommodating but my head began to hurt from his banality
i almost didnt notice it had happened but i threw up all over him
and i couldnt stop myself from laughing
closes book no dates indicated
theyre placed on the shelves in no discernible order
he describes a scab on his arm for five pages then writes about existential philosophy on the next
he looks into the adjoining paint room
its just his mind poured out on paper
mills leans in the doorway looking at does strange artworks
you were right
he is preaching
the phone rings in the other room
all attention is focused on the phone on does desk
a tape recorder is rigged to the receiver
mills and somerset enter
mills walks over pushes a button on the recorder picks up
into phone hello
from recorder i admire you david
imagine my surprise on finding you at my doorstep
i admire you more and more every day
into phone okay john
from recorder no no no
you listen and dont talk
i suppose you found the painting and the photos
this is just as well
now we all know weve all seen each other
pause i mean what i say
i do admire you
oh there is one other thing
fourteen hundred thirty
west eighty sixth street
apartment six o four
john doe hangs up
somerset looks around this femininely decorated bathroom
in the sink objects covered in blood a pair of scissors a hypodermic needle first aid tape and gauze bandages a bottle of anesthetic for use with the needle a
somerset moves from the sink looks in the bathtub
the tub and shower walls are splattered with blood
the tub has a few inches of water in it
the water is cloudy red and bits of gauze float in it
somerset jiggles the drains knob
some bubbles pop up from the clogged drain
mills is in a dark mood
he and dr
oneill stand by a woman who hangs by a noose from the ceiling
the womans head has been bandaged sloppily with white gauze and tape
her eyes have been left uncovered
the gauze is stained red in small spots
the woman hangs low so her feet are inches from the floor where piles of dried flowers and a cordless telephone lay
theres a chair knocked over behind her
oneills going through his black bag
a violet velvet curtain has been draped on the wall in the corner behind a full length mirror
the mirror reflects the corpse
a seven pointed star is smeared in lipstick on the mirrors surface with the words i did not kill her she was given a choice below
somerset enters from the bathroom looks at the murder display
just like in the painting
he walks to a dresser
the womans purse sits open and somerset extracts her drivers license
he looks at the photo
the woman in the picture is beautiful
you can see what he did
oneill steps up to the woman
he brandishes dull scissors
the captain enters with two uniform cops
he looks around grim clenching his jaw
cut her up
dressed the wounds
he put the noose around her neck and stood her on the chair
she had the telephone
call for help and youll live
but youll be mutilated
or kick out the chair and spare yourself a lifetime of hideousness
oneills cutting the bandages on the womans face
he pulls them away in front
mills looks disgusted by the sight
somerset sits in a chair runs his fingers through his hair
he cut off her nose to spite her face
and he did it very recently
alright boys youre running on empty
just make sure you sleep with the phone between your knees
the bookstore is a labyrinth
tables and shelves mountains and valleys of books
books new and used hard and soft in disorganized groups
classical music plays
a few customers search for titles
somerset walks downcast winds out of one aisle into another
he has his jacket over his shoulder runs his fingers along the books as he goes
he pulls one book the merchant of venice looks at it replaces it
he looks down the aisle and is surprised to see tracy
tracy stands solemn scanning book spines
tracy brightens a bit upon recognizing him
how are you
im glad to see you found this place
i almost should have expected to run into you here knowing that you teach english
tracy looks up and around
its so huge
this is why i moved into this neighborhood
dont you love the smell of all the old books
it smells like
i guess just old books but i love it
somerset notices tracy noticing his gun
no matter how often i see guns i cant get used to them
she looks at her watch
if davids going to be back home soon i should get back
she starts down the aisle and somerset walks with her
i hope youll come to dinner another night
before you leave
you can stay and browse a little longer cant you
tracy considers this as they enter an open area
i hardly know anyone i can talk about books with anymore
id appreciate the company
somerset looks hopeful
tracy is very tempted
shelves and empty aisles of books
classical music still plays
the irony is that after a day of the type of work he did hed come home and read me these morbid crime stories
le fanus green tea
murders in the rue morgue
move to the aisle marked mystery where somerset and tracy are leaning against shelves
they both hold books theyve selected
my mother would give him hell
because i was young and he was keeping me up till all hours giving me nightmares
sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps
one birthday he gave me a hardcover book called the century of the detective by jurgen thorwald
it traced the history of detection as a science and it sealed my fate
because it was real and that a drop of blood or a piece of hair could solve a crime
was incredible to me
a clerk looks down the aisle then walks on
were closing up somerset
davids going to wonder where i am
ill give you a ride
please dont bother
i have to insist
if your husband found out i let you ride the subway at this hour hed tear my head off
they make their way out of the aisle
i mean literally
somersets car stops at the corner of mills street
somerset puts the car in park
tracy sits for a long time then turns to face somerset
youve lived here for so long somerset
you know this city
tracy cant quite figure how to put it
its a hard place tracy
when david and i lived in philadelphia we could afford to live on the outskirts
pause i hate it here
i feel scared and i feel sick and
i hate it
tracy wants to laugh like its silly but cant pull it off
you have to put blinders on sometimes
but keep in mind tracy like tonight there are small pockets of sanity
some bars and bookstores
several last vestiges of civilization
in somersets car tracy and somerset continue talking
on the other side of the street closer to the middle of the block john does car is parallel parked at the curb
behind the wheel john doe is slumped low calmly watching somerset and tracy
he can see them clearly from here
tracy looks out through the windshield fighting tears
ive visited so many of the schools looking for work you know
and the conditions are
i cant believe how bad it is
pause children shouldnt have to grow up here
you can always look into the private schools
youll find something
somerset gives her a handkerchief
she wipes her tears
youre too hard on yourself tracy
she will not look at him keeping herself under control
its okay to hate this city
but there is a bright side in all this
you want to hear it
tracy is able to muster a small smile
oh god yes
i cant think of another place that needs education more than this city
and youre a teacher
you can make a difference in a few peoples lives
its a very good thing
tracy leans to give him a kiss on the cheek
they remain close looking into each others eyes
somerset reaches to touch tracys face
they kiss a long time
tracy wraps her arms around somersets neck
somerset runs his fingers through tracys hair
they share their sorrow
tracys tears run down her face
finally they part opening their eyes
they know this is wrong
somersets hands are shaking
he grips the wheel feels helpless
im sorry tracy
tracys face is flushed
she is confused
i better go
tracy gets out neglects to close the door not looking back
somerset tries to come to his senses
he doesnt understand either and his heart is aching
he adjusts the rearview mirror to watch tracy go
tracy walks down the block straightening her hair
somerset looks away from the mirror
he holds his head in his hands for a moment
somerset leans to pull the door shut puts the car in gear
he drives turns the corner
john doe watches somersets car leave
doe turns his attention to tracy who hurries along the other side of the street
tracy looks back enters her apartment building digs out her keys
she gets through the door and climbs stairs disappearing
doe gets out of his car
he looks both ways down the street walks towards mills and tracys building
mills and tracy are asleep in their bed
mills eyes shift under their lids
rapid eye movement
a sound is heard from the other room
he lays still a moment then gets up slowly reaches to take his gun off the bedside table
he grabs his pants from a chair slides into them
mills opens the bedroom door and enters quietly gun held up
he moves crouching
in the dark objects in the room and shadows from windows form complex confusing patterns
mills walks between moving boxes attempting to remain silent
he aims the gun from point to point as he advances
he gets to a closet
staying on one side he opens the door and points his gun
he carefully separates the clothing hanging there
he turns to look over the room
its the first time we see it in mills eyes real fear
the door to the apartment is wide open
mills moves from his apartment gun out into the dark hallway
the coast is clear
he stays low moves down the hall
he stops looks up
mills shoves the rooftop door open
it creaks as it swings
mills moves out backwards looking to top the raised rooftop entrance covering it with his gun
he moves around sees nothing walks to the edge of the roof and looks over
mills returns to the bedroom still holding his gun up
he looks at tracy asleep in the bed
the room begins to rattle a little as a subway train is again passing underground
he walks to the window and checks the lock
he opens the window and reaches out
the rattling is a bit louder
from the fire escape he picks up a bundle of thorny thistles wrapped with a rubber band
mills realizes doe was here
the room is plain like the room mrs
gold was kept in
the door opens and tracy and mills enter
they look sleepy carrying suitcases
a uniformed cop closes the door for them
mills goes to lay a suitcase on a table while tracy looks around depressed distant
the lighting is bad
there are no decorations no windows
a wide crack runs down one wall
tracy sits down on the bed
mills notices her discontent
it wont be for long honey
this is just till this is over
mills goes to sit beside her
he puts his hand on her shoulder
she stands goes to start turning down the covers
it cant be helped
mills feels useless powerless
he goes to the suitcase and starts unpacking the contents
tracy continues turning down the sheets
the chalkboard gluttony x lust greed x envy sloth x wrath pride x somerset is seated holding the photo of the lust painting from the tableau
mills is behind his own desk
they both look like they havent gotten much sleep
theres two people in that painting
so maybe hes planning to kill two people this time
mills looks at somerset who doesnt seem to be listening
whats wrong this morning
somerset looks up sips from a cup of coffee looks at the photo
mills swings his chair looks out the window at the morning light on the billboard
lust is next
lust is sex
apples on the floor
adam and eve
somerset puts the photo down leans back takes out a cigarette
sex sex sex
lust is everywhere
thats the hard part
i think lust is the most prevalent sin even more than greed
somerset looks at the burning tip of his cigarette
he gets up to stretch his legs
mills picks up the lust photo puts his feet up on the desk
lust is red
red sky at night sailors delight
red light district
somerset and mills look at each other
that would make sense
it would be fitting
youre damn right it would
mills picks up the phone
porno theaters and adult bookstores rule these busy sidewalks
marquees offer sexy stuff pussy fest and movies like midnight plowboy and national lam porns christmas insertion
cops are walking through the pedestrian flow handing out photocopies
there are many patrol cars on the street
definitely a larger than usual police presence
cops are questioning the proprietors of porn at the entrances of their shops and theaters
cops are taping photocopies onto lamp posts
these photocopies are warnings with the drawing of john does face above a line of information and the words have you seen this man
somersets holding up the composite sketch of john doe
yeah he was here
mills and somerset are across the sales counter from wild bill
wild bill is shirtless covered in tattoos
a thick scar runs down his forehead to his bent nose
leather belts whips and jackets hang from the walls
it was definitely him
easy name to remember
what was this job you did for him
wild bill pulls a box from behind the counter digs in it
i got a picture of it
thats what he came for this morning
i figured he must be one of those art guys
like those guys who piss in a cup and drink it on stage
wild bill gives a polaroid to mills
we dont see the image
i think i undercharged him
i was up all night working to finish it
looks at photo you built this for him
you built this
ive built weirder shit than that
a beel chimes as a policeman enters the store
we have a situation
mills and somerset follow the policeman out
hey my picture
wild bill scratches his scar
its a madhouse outside the hot house
police action in progress
cops have formed a barrier holding off a crowd and creating an aisle to the back of a jail van
cops and detectives escort various men women and transvestites into the large vehicle
the crowd consisting of the dregs of society is angry
some spit and throw trash at the cops
an angry cop pounds his nightstick on a glass cage
inside the cage sits an oily fat man in front of a wall of sex toys
get out of the fucking booth
ill come out just wait
all the lights and walls are red
mills and somerset follow a cop through the twisting corridors
rock music throbs
they reach a door
i dont want to go in there again
mills and somerset enter
rock music continues loud
a strobe light flashes from the ceiling onto two ambulance attendants
the first attendant places a sheet over a bed hiding the corpse of a woman with long blonde hair
the second attendant tries to examine the pupils of a crazed man who sits naked on the floor wrapped in a sheet
a cop holds the crazed man down
he made me do it
i have to look at you
i have to look at you
an x is scratched into the red paint on the wall
mills and somerset move towards the covered body
there are apples on the bed and floor
the rock music from outside suddenly stops
youre not going to want to see this more than once
he had a gun
he made me do it
the sheet is lifted for the detectives
they grimace at what they see
we do not see
somerset closes his eyes and walks to face a wall shaken
the first attendant replaces the sheet
mills steps back takes out his handkerchief and sucks on it
he made me do it
a polaroid is on a white table
it is the photo wild bill gave to mills and somerset
it is a picture of a belt made with extra leather straps so it can be worn securely around the groin
it is a strap on phallus but there is no plastic protuberance
instead there is a metal knife
it is a strap on butchers knife
somerset is seated beside the white table in this white room
mills stands behind him
the crazed man from the lust murder is in a chair across the room
the crazed man is crying
and he said
he asked if i was married
and i could see he had a gun in his hand
where was the girl
where was the prostitute
she was on the bed
she was just sitting on the bed
who tied her down
you or him
he had a gun
he had a gun and he made it happen
he made me do it
he made me put it on
he made me wear it
he had the gun in my mouth
the man slides off the chair and hides his face in his hands
the gun was in my throat
mills looks at the mirror in the room
somerset stands picks up the polaroid as two men in white uniforms enter to collect the crazed man from off the floor
somerset and mills are shell shocked seated at their desks
somerset is looking out the window
mills stares at the wall
somerset looks to his temporary desk
he picks up a small pile of mail sorts through it
an by manila envelope interests him
it reads detective somerset on the outside handwritten in red marker
he opens it
he takes out a grainy photograph of he and tracy kissing in his car
its obviously been taken with a special night lens
somerset goes pale suppressing a gasp
he holds the photo to hide it from mills looks to see mills has not noticed
he feels panicky crumples the photo and envelope in his hand
somerset enters latches the door
he takes the crushed photo and envelope from his pocket
he quickly checks under the stalls to see he is alone
he opens a window goes to the sink
he takes out his cigarette lighter lights the envelope and photo watches them catch
once theyre burning steady he throws them in the sink
he backs away leans against the wall watching feeling sick
somerset and mills sit with a full pitcher of beer between them
the jukebox plays quietly for other customers
the walls of the bar are lined with trophies ribbons and other victory symbols
theres not going to be a happy ending
its not possible
if we get him ill be happy enough
face it now
stop thinking its good guys against the bad guys in this city
mills drinks deep pours more
how can you say that
especially after today
you tell me
when you walk into an apartment and a man has beaten his wife to death or a wife murdered her husband in cold blood
and you have to wash the blood off their children
you put the killer in jail
if i thought like you id have slit my wrists a long time ago
wheres the victory
you do your job
follow the law and do the best you can
its all there
if we caught john doe tomorrow and it turned out he was the devil
if it turned out he was literally satan then that might live up to our expectations
no human being could do these horrible things right
but this is not the devil
its only a man
why dont you shut the fuck up for a while
you make these speeches
like you know everything there is to know
somerset sits back looking at mills
you think youre preparing me for the hard times ahead
you think youre toughening me up
well youre not
pause youre quitting fine
but im staying to fight
who are you fighting for
people dont want a champion
they just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers
what the fuck is wrong with you huh
what burnt you out
theres no one thing if thats what you mean
i cant live anymore where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue
youre so much better than everyone right
no ones worthy of you
i sympathize completely
because if you cant win
then if you dont ignore everything and everyone around you you go insane
its easier to smoke crack and not worry that your wife and kids are starving to death
and its so much easier to bear a child till that child finally shuts up because it takes so much work to love
and if you bothered to think about the abuse and the damage youd be sad
youre talking about people who are mentally ill
cuts in furious no i am not
im talking about common everyday life here
where ignorance isnt bliss its a matter of survival
listen to yourself
you say the problem with people is they dont care so i dont care about people
but if youre not part of the solution
cuts him off people who are in arguments over their heads always use meaningless slogans
but life doesnt conform to analogies
youre already here and youve been here a long time
so theres a part of you that knows even if everything you say is true none of it matters
that part of me is dead
you want me to agree with you
yeah youre right somerset this place is fucked
lets go live in a fucking log cabin
well i dont agree with you
youre quitting and it makes me sick
cause youre the best ive ever seen
mills digs out some money and throws it on the table
thanks for the beer
other patrons watch him go
somerset takes out a cigarette
he goes to light it
the lighter will not light and when it does somersets hand is shaking
mills comes quietly into the bedroom
tracy is asleep in the bed
mills takes off his jacket puts it down
he sits on a chair and unties one shoe takes it off
he looks at tracy looks at her a long time
he puts the shoe on the floor and goes to get on the bed
he kisses tracys forehead looks at her sleeping innocently
he is touched saddened
he kisses her cheek then wraps his arms under and around her
he holds tight kisses her again
mills his face against her holding tighter still
i love you
tracy holds his face in her hands sees that he is crying
i love you
mills clings to her
she wraps her arms around him as he cries quietly against her and she kisses him tries to comfort him
john doe walks in this section of huge industrial complexes
factories and foundries are lined side by side seemingly for miles
we can hear tugboat horns sounding low and deep
were near the water
doe seems to know where hes going
he passes stacks of industrial piping and steel drums piled to the sky
he walks through an industrial junk yard filled with trashed bulldozers trucks and discarded factory equipment
its like a stroll through a bone yard of dead dinosaurs
at the end of this field of metal there is a tall narrow alleyway formed by two warehouses
doe enters looking up at the single lit bulb on the wall above
he looks at the ground picks up a rock and a beaten hubcap walks under the bulb
he throws the hubcap with all his might
it soars but misses the bulb falls to the ground behind
doe takes aim with the rock
he throws grunting
the rock smashes the bulb bringing darkness to the alley
doe walks back to the mouth of the alley
he stops and turns to start from there
he walks deliberately looking down at his feet
follow as he walks
he stops looks back to the way he came then looks down at the ground in front of him again
he takes off his thick glasses
he holds the glasses in his hand
somerset is in bed
the metronome is sounding tick tick tick
the sounds of the city are loud
somerset closes his eyes concentrating on the metronome
tick tick tick
a man and a woman are heard screaming at each other incoherently from outside
somerset rolls over restless
tick tick tick
a third voice is heard from outside
this man is screaming at the other two people to shut up
somerset opens his eyes sits up
he reaches over grabs the metronome and throws it against the wall
somerset sits away from the bed
hes smoking a cigarette
the phone rings
somerset gets up not in the best of moods
into phone hello
from phone upset hello somerset
is everything alright
could you meet me somewhere
pause i dont think thats a good idea
i need to talk to someone somerset
youre the only friend i have here
i dont know anyone else
somerset and tracy are seated in a booth by the window
the citys morning rush passes by outside
the cafe is noisy
tracy is very upset
somerset is very uneasy
david doesnt know about this
you havent told him
tracy shakes her head
i have to tell you tracy im not the one to talk to about this
i just cant think straight
i dont know why i called you except i cant stand to hold it as a secret anymore
i had to get it out
and i cant tell david yet
somerset takes out his cigarettes but thinks better of it and puts them away
he watches tracy stir her coffee
i had a relationship once very much like a marriage
and there was a baby
a long time ago
things were good
and i got up one morning and i went on a case
a murder like any other
except it was my first since hearing about the baby
and i felt this fear and anxiety coming over me
i looked around and i thought how can i raise a child here
so that night i told her i didnt want us to have children and over the next few weeks
i convinced her
tears come to somersets eyes
i mean i wore her down
i want to have children
i can tell you i know
im positive i made the right decision
im positive it was the right thing to do
but theres never a day that goes by that i dont wish i had decided differently
tracy reaches to hold somersets hand but he withdraws it wipes his tears away
if you decide not to have the baby
if thats what you decide then never tell mills you were pregnant
i mean that
pause your marriage would just wither and die altogether
tracy looks around the cafe tears in her eyes
but if you decide to have the baby then at that very instant when youre absolutely sure
tell him that exact second
and spoil that kid every chance you get
he forces a smile
thats all the wisdom i can share with you tracy
i barely know you
will i see you again before you leave
but its probably better that way
somerset steps away leaves
tracy watches him go
mills and somerset walk towards the precinct house
they wade through cars to cross the street
i want to stay on till this is over
till either its done or we can see it will never end
mills remains impassive
oh you want to stay now
one of two things is going to happen
were either going to get john doe
or he will finish his series of seven and hell never be found
you think if you stay youre doing me some big favor
im requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days
youd be doing me the favor
you knew id say yes
i wasnt sure at all
they enter the precinct house
down the sidewalk from a distance comes john doe
his brown workboots and clothing are splattered with blood
he walks towards the precinct house hands in his pockets like hes merely out for a walk on a sunday afternoon
people on the sidewalk stop upon seeing him avoiding him
mills and somerset walk past booking cubicles and benches of handcuffed low lifes
the place is swimming with activity
the two detectives head to a duty desk at the end of the room
as soon as this is over ill be gone
what a great big surprise that is
they pass through a gate and somerset goes to the staircase leading to the second floor
mills stops at the duty desk
other cops are fighting for the duty sergeants attention
mills and somerset are on the premises
wonder fucking ful
mills stops looks
somerset stops looks back down the stairs
john doe stands inside the precinct house doors
he holds out his arms as if to say presto here i am
near silence comes to the room as all eyes go to the figure of john doe
mills is riveted finding this impossible to comprehend
one uniformed cop takes out his gun points it at john doe
several other cops drop what theyre doing and draw weapons
mills still off balance walks back through the gate takes his gun out and points it at doe
get down on the floor
somerset comes back down the stairs
cops move slowly in on doe from all sides
you heard him
get on the floor
john doe gets on his knees hands up
mills moves close but not too
one cop comes from behind nudges doe with his foot
spread your legs and get your hands out in front of you
john doe gets on his stomach obeys
mills comes right up to doe steps on his neck puts his gun against does head
dont move a fucking inch
cops frisk and handcuff doe
somerset comes beside mills
i dont believe it
hello lieutenant somerset
what the hell is this
the cop putting the handcuffs on doe holds up does hands
every single one of does fingers has a bandage wrapped around it
john doe looks up his face pressed against the floor glasses askew mills gun at his temple
i want to speak with my lawyer
mills somerset and the captain stand in darkness
on the other side of a two way mirror john doe is seated in a restraining chair in an interrogation room
his hands and legs are bound with leather straps to the chairs arm and legs
a strap hold tight around does throat
this is not some superman serial killer
he looks more like an eccentric college professor
his lawyer mark swarr sits at a table taking notes
mills holds a fingerprint card
the black ink prints are just useless blobs with traces of blood in them
he cuts off the skin of his fingertips
thats why we cant find a single usable print in his apartment
for a long time hes been cutting before the papillary lines can grow back
what about the trace on his bank account
the orphanage is all we have
his bank account is only five years old and it started as cash
theres no credit history no employment history
we even tried to trace his furniture
all we know for sure is hes wealthy well educated and totally insane
we may never know how he got that way
somerset stands looking in at doe
because he is john doe by choice
when do we get to question him
this goes to court now
this doesnt make sense captain
he wouldnt just turn himself in
well there he sits
its not supposed to make sense
hes not finished
youre wound way too tight on this mills
help me out here
somerset looks at them
the captain leaves
mills is furious
damn it somerset
you know johnnys fucking with us
hes pissing in our faces again
you and i are probably for the first time ever in total agreement
he wouldnt just stop
what the fuck man
john does only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece right
but can you even conceive of what might happen next
i mean can you tell me how hes going to go about it
i can tell you this i recognize his lawyer
his name is mark swarr
hes the one who kept zero out of prison
pause well wait for john does plea
mills is at the desk with his feet up stares at the chalkboard gluttony x lust x greed x wrath sloth x envy pride x clock on the wall says
somerset packs books into boxes preparing for his eventual departure
the captain opens the door and steps into the office
he clears his throat looking like there is something very wrong
mills and somerset stand together
the captain is behind his desk with the d
martin talbot seated in front of him
mark swarr addresses them all seems nervous but in control
my client says there are two more bodies
two more dead hidden away
he will take detective mills to these bodies but only detective mills
only at six oclock today
swarr wipes his brow with a handkerchief
he says he admires you
to captain this is all part of his game plan
doe claims that if the detective does not accept this offer the bodies will never be found
frankly counselor im inclined to let them rot
mills walks up into swarrs face
you like what you do for a living
back off mills
im required by law to serve my clients to the best of my ability and to serve their interests
mills eases off
talbot is agitated tapping a finger on the gold tooth in his mouth
he looks at swarr
we dont make deals like this
were going to have to pass
he also wishes that i inform you if you do not accept he will plead insanity across the board
let him try
id like to see him try
come now martin
even he knows with the nature of these crimes i could get him off with such a plea
talbot stands wringing his hands
mills and somerset are looking at each other thinking it over
im not letting this conviction slide
i can tell you that right here and right now
he says if you accept under his specific conditions he will sign a full confession and plead guilty
right here and right now
talbot looks at swarr with hatred
ill do it
just a minute
somerset turns to talbot
if he were to plead insanity
this conversation is admissible
the fact that hes blackmailing us with his plea
and my client reminds you two more people are dead
the press would have a field day if they found out the police didnt seem too concerned about finding them
giving them proper burial
ill do it
i want to finish it
somerset is thinking it through
he looks at mills
to captain well
lets get the fucking lawyer out of the room and we can talk about how this whole things going to go down
mills hand reaches to the sink to pick up a razor
hes shirtless his chest covered in shaving cream
he starts shaving in front of a mirror
somerset is behind him smoking
if john does head splits open and a u
flies out i want you to have expected it
stay as cold as ice
somerset flicks ash in the sink
mills finishes shaving
he steps away from the sink and wipes his chest off with a towel
very serious listen somerset
weve been through a lot together
and i uh
what is it
i would like to make sweet love to you
somerset walks away
as they leave
give me a kiss on the lips
give me a break
mills has his shirt off
a female technician josie tapes a radio transmitter and microphone to his chest
somerset sits nearby at one of the ready room desks
he wears a bullet proof vest is just finishing a check of his gun
hes putting the bullets back into it
josie finishes prepping mills
mills presses the adhesive making sure it will hold
he puts on a shirt and bullet proof vest fastens the velcro
somerset stands puts the gun in his hip holster
mills picks up his own gun checks it holsters it
he watches somerset take out a roll of antacids
somerset pops a few
they look at each other
mills holds out his hand
they shake on it
the street is full of shadows as the sun is falling low
on the steps of the precinct house a throng of reporters shifts anxiously
a line of policemen holds them back
the precinct doors open
martin talbot arrives escorted by cops
the press swarm lurches forward flashbulbs explode
talbot holds out his hands quieting them about to speak
mills car pulls out of the fenced parking lot
john doe is seated in the rear
the car speeds up on the street turns onto an avenue heading into a canyon formed by tall buildings
at the corner a car is parked
somerset is at the wheel
he pulls out follows mills car
california is dressed in full battle gear
he looks through binoculars at the city below
the wind blows hard
he turns and runs to a sleek helicopter on the roofs heli pad climbs in the side door
the pilot leans back from the cockpit to hand him a helmet
california dons it starts strapping himself in so he can lean out the open door
is this wind going to hurt us
the pilot cranks the helicopters whining engine and the blades start to spin churning the air
just makes the ride a little more fun
california hefts a high powered automatic rifle as the chopper lifts from the pad and takes off
mills drives looking to the back seat through the rearview mirror
a steel mesh partition separates front from back
john doe sits with his hands cuffed
he is dressed in gray pants and a gray shirt
his feet are cuffed to a metal fastener on the floor of the car
rivulets of sweat pour down his face
he seems wired
whats your story johnny
who are you really
doe pushes his glasses back up the bridge of his nose looks at mills eyes in the rearview mirror
it doesnt matter who i am
who i am means absolutely nothing
somerset adjusts the volume on a radio receiver mounted on the dash
he watches the road ahead tailing mills
from receiver whats your deal
you seem pretty fucking nervous
from receiver i want this to go well
its very important to me obviously
the chopper hovers amongst skyscrapers
california and the pilot are listening through their helmet headsets
from headset you want this to go well
what is this
from headset turn right on this street
stay in the left lane
california leans out the chopper door using his binoculars
mills car weaves through traffic
somersets car isnt far behind goes through a red light barely missing a truck
other cars blow their horns
a cellular phone on the passenger side is beeping
somerset pushes a button on the phones panel
he puts on a headset telephone speaks into the mouthpiece
from headset downtown and moving west
looks like youre going to be crossing water
if were on the bridge you keep your distance
you hear me
the helicopter hovers steady
california stows his binoculars
from headset cross the river before us if necessary
you got it
california taps the pilots helmet
the helicopter dips flying like a bullet over the city skyline heading towards the river and the setting sun
from high above we see traffic on the highway at the polluted rivers edge
cards and trucks move like blood through veins
down closer we can see mills car in the flow
the car turns into a lane of traffic on its way to the huge suspension bridge
somersets car is in close pursuit
under the bridge the police helicopter travels close to the water moving parallel to the bridge but low so that its out of the sightline of the vehicles above
traffic is bumper to bumper
somerset moves his headset mouthpiece to smoke a cigarette
he steers onto the bridge under the massive girders
from receiver for us to go pick up two more dead bodies and have that be the end of it
just seems too boring for you
beyond the crest of the bridge the sunset is crimson
wouldnt be sensational enough
wanting people to pay attention you cant just tap them on the shoulder
john doe strains to turn looks out the back window
sometimes you have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer
and then you get their strict attention
what are you looking at johnny
at the city proper
doe situates forward holds his hands in front of his face looking at his bandaged fingers
and yet no pillar of salt
smiles to himself lost on you isnt it
youve never read the bible have you david
i remember a lot of people reading it at me when i was a kid
i preferred the classic comic version myself
this is an affront to doe angers him
mills sees it likes it
i used to have godspell on an eight track tape
does that count
doe leans forwards fury building in him
you make me sick
sit back freak
mills slams his fist against the partition
doe sits back
under his breath ignorant heathen
you think these murders were for god
pause im asking you seriously
you really think what you did was gods good work
doe looks out the window at other cars refuses to answer
hes pressing the tips of his forefingers into his thumbs causing blood to drip from under the bandages
the lord works in mysterious ways
its getting dark
weve been in this section of factories before with john doe
the police helicopter soars overhead
californias looking down wearing night vision goggles
the goggles allow california to see clearly into the maze formed by buildings yards and worksheds below
no one in sight
theres about a thousand places to be ambushed out here
the headlights are off
mills cars red brake lights are far ahead on this industrial road
from headset i dont see anything
in mouthpiece a quick sweep is all we get
clear out now
youre right in front of us
somerset reaches to turn up the volume on his radio receiver
mills is heard singing jesus christ superstar loud
somerset allows a very faint smile
mills drives along singing
jesus christ superstar
who in the world do you think you are
jesus christ superstar
does in the back seat trying to bear it steaming
the chopper goes high away over the industrial area
it moves to the other side of the factories and settles in low over the river
mills tune comes to a conclusion
somerset slows the car as he sees mills brake lights go on ahead
from receiver we can walk from here
in mouthpiece you stay out of this unless i call you in california
from headset youre in charge
somerset takes off the headset phone stops the car
somerset gets out
he looks through binoculars
mills car has stopped under the lights of a junk yard
mills gets out
he walks to unlock the passenger door
from receiver alright somerset
going for a stroll
mills opens the passenger door
doe looks out
lean on your side
hands behind your head and lock your fingers together
mills moves to unchain does feet cautious
mills lets doe out
doe does a deep knee bend to loosen his legs
mills takes out his gun
from receiver where are we going
doe points with handcuffed hands at a path through the junk yard towards warehouses
mills motions with his gun
from receiver lead the way
doe starts walking
mills follows keeping the gun on doe
we lose sight of them behind the junk yards massive pieces
somerset lowers his binoculars
he gets back in the car leaves the lights off drives slowly towards mills car
mills follows doe past rusting collections of machines
we took this walk with doe before through this metallic bone yard
its right this way
mills is on edge
his eyes search the towering twisted junk
sharp edges reach for the sky
glass breaks under their feet
so far so good
sounds of boats on the river can be heard
does heading for the alleyway created by two warehouses beyond the junk yard
doe nears the alleyway
it is pitch dark
doe stops before entering turns to mills
mills steps up keeping his distance from doe
he cant see a thing in the blackness ahead
you go first
doe faces the alley
he starts walking
we move with him as he goes
hes counting silently to himself moving his lips
mills walks behind doe keeping a sharp eye out in all directions
hes about ten feet behind doe keeping his gun trained on the back of does skull
tell me where were going
doe continues walking counting his steps a bit quicker
somerset has pulled along mills car at the junk yard
from receiver slow down johnny
stop right there
pause i said stop
doe walks on
mills is behind walking to close the gap
we can hear the faint sound of rushing water
ill blow your head off right now
doe stops abruptly
he spins on his heels facing mills
mills is getting closer pumped ready to pull the trigger
doe reaches up with his hands takes off his glasses
he holds them in one hand
the sound of the water is louder
mills is about six feet from doe and knows somethings wrong
john doe smiles
doe takes one step backwards and falls straight down disappears in the blink of an eye
somerset looks towards the far off alleyway horrified
from receiver motherfucker
mills stands facing the open manhole cover doe disappeared into
a torrent of water rushes by underground
mills fires a few futile shots into the water out of his mind with rage
he pulls back the top of his bullet proof vest exposing the microphone
hes gone somerset
hes in the water
somerset leaps out takes out his gun
follow as he runs into the junk yard as fast as he can
from receiver im going in
the choppers over the river
california listens intently
from headset i have to go in after him
static crackles loud in his headset then it goes dead
california grips his mouthpiece
somerset whats going on down there
an underground pipe way
mills tries to swim is mostly carried in the flow
hes battered against the sides of the pipe holding his breath desperately
follow somerset as he charges onwards through the junk yard stumbling over pieces of metal
he runs towards the alleyway
a square pool of water churns
a moment then mills rises gasping choking
hes disoriented furious waving his gun expecting doe to be right on top of him
no one around
this is some sort of unmanned water switching station
the walls are covered in catwalks drainage pipes and tunnels
some tunnels and pipes spew water down into the central pool others are sealed shut
mills pulls himself from the central pool to a concrete spillway
he stands up searching
doe could be anywhere
come on johnny
im right here
there is a plastic bag with an automatic pistol and extra clip inside hanging from a protruding shut off valve
john does hands tear the bag open taking the contents
somerset enters the alley short of breath
he points his gun in front of him fearful
california is enraged looks towards the pilot
god damn it
lets do something
somerset said wait
i dont know
mills climbs onto a catwalk
he passes tunnels looking down each intense ready to kill
a waterfall flows and over the other end of the catwalk
mills stands looking over the railing at the central pool and other tunnels
he points his gun and fires into a far tunnel
lets do it
you and me
a figure appears in the center of the waterfall behind mills
im not going to let you win this
john doe steps out of the waterfall putting on his glasses
he seems calm unloads his gun into mills back
mills twists blown forward by the bullets slamming into his bullet proof vest
blam blam blam
he stumbles trying to turn and fire back but bullets strike him down and he falls to the floor of the catwalk gun falling from his hand
does gun is empty
the gunshots echo
mills lays there on his stomach pounded blacking out the hot bullets in his vest smoking and sizzling from the water splashing them
doe moves quickly starts searching mills pockets
somerset comes upon the open manhole
water rushes by
the central pool bubbles undulating
somerset surfaces inhaling bringing his gun up
no one in sight
his voice reverberates barely heard against the roaring water
he swims to the edge climbs out
he walks looking
pleading pull out now
somerset looks up and freezes up on seeing does handcuffs hang swinging on the rail of the catwalk above with mills radio transmitter and wire tied to them
somerset runs to his car driven gasping for breath still soaking wet
he stops for one second looks
not too far away the police helicopter flies low to the ground turning in wide circles
somerset climbs into the car starts it up
he drives away leaving his lights off
the engine protests loudly forced to its limit
the car disappears in darkness
the police helicopter circles useless
the church stands elegant at night when its decayed state is partially hidden
small shafts of light escape from holes in the facade and just into the blackness
somerset is out of his car
he strides towards the church checks his gun as he goes
follow with him getting closer to the church
he climbs the stairs
somerset steps up and kicks the church doors open met by a tremendous blast of light flickering orange light from hundreds of once tall orange candles now burnt low
they greet somerset in the churchs old candle racks on the floor on the altar and all through out the pews
somersets eyes try to adjust to the light
he holds his gun ready walks down the long center aisle
doe sounds far his voice echoing from the front of the church
tell me what you want
somerset can see through the heat warp
doe stands facing him from the altar
what do i want
the same you
i want an ending
stay where you are
put your gun on the floor and slide it all the way down here
somerset obeys bends slides the gun down the aisle till it hits the bottom altar stair
he keeps walking slowly
i want to see him
show me mills
on the altar doe is sweating hard standing over mills
mills is slumped forward on the floor unconscious
his bullet proof vest has been removed
mills hands are tied tight together in front of him tied to one end of the thick rope suspended from the ceiling
doe holds the other end of the rope has his gun tucked under his belt
youre an intelligent man somerset
you understand what youre a part of dont you
when this is finished it will seem surreal but it will be a whole crystalline reality
and no one will be able to deny it no matter how hard they try
does voice is thick with passion
somerset is about halfway down the aisle still moving
youre a murderer
the only way youve distinguished yourself is by your particular brutality
doe walks across the altar
you know thats not true
youre killing innocent people and i should admire you
youre doing it because it gives you pleasure
thats the only purpose
your sick pleasure
doe picks up a container of gasoline looks out at somerset
stay where you are
i wont deny my personal desires
doe begins dousing mills with gasoline covering mills body and clothing
mills stirs coming to
he coughs choking on the gas and fumes
but i dont mourn the victims in this any more than i mourn the thousands who died in sodom and gomorrah
somerset looks fearful
he starts approaching again
all youve done is cause more misery and pain
youve given people all the more reason to believe there is no god
somerset eyes his gun at the bottom of the stairs
doe sees somerset moving throws the gas can away takes out his gun
doe walks to the edge of the altar all the time holding his end of the rope
somerset is twitching with anger looking at the gun about fifteen feet in front of him
mills manages to look up weak his eyes barely able to open because of the stinging gasoline
doe takes one step down off the altar
somerset is still edging forward hands out away from his body
do you really think im just going to let this happen
you think im going to let him die
doe fires his gun and the bullet slams into the front of somersets bullet proof vest
somerset flies back knocking over a rack of candles on his way to the floor
doe walks quickly back onto the altar
mills tries to grab at doe as he passes but doe turns and kicks mills in the ribs
mills cringes in pain
somerset lays in the aisle on his stomach gasping
he cant catch his breath his twisted face pressed against the floor
how can you speak of god somerset
when was the last time you spoke his name
mills tries to rub the gas out of his eyes with his bound hands
his mind works feverishly
he looks around to see where he is then he searches the floor
we can see inside his open shirt the bleeding upside down cross doe has cut into his chest
doe walks back to shout angrily down at somerset
when did you last speak his name
was it in prayer
or did you say the lords name after you stubbed your big toe
or did you use his name to curse another man
somerset holds his chest blinking trying not to black out
mills finds a piece of broken stained glass on the floor
he picks it up palms it still choking on gasoline
doe walks over to the statue of saint jerome emiliani pulling the rope from above so it goes taut and mills arms raise above his head
doe wraps the rope around emilianis arm
im going to kill you johnny
im going to see you dead
doe begins twisting the loose end of the rope around the statue
the irony david is that you policemen and i want the same things
but you are so short sighted
in this city where you can see a deadly sin on every street corner
and in every home we want repentance
mills clutches the glass piece and starts cutting the rope just above his hands
we want good over evil
we want values instilled in the children
we want a world where a man or woman can lead a decent life
pause wisdom understanding counsel fortitude knowledge piety and fear of the lord
such simple concepts
why are they non existent
somerset manages to life his head struggles to his knees
weakly let him go god damn you
doe checks to make sure the rope around saint emiliani is secure tightening the knots
there were two men once who had wonderful gardens
two gardens of flowers that went on as far as the eye could see
the fragrance was inspiration in itself
doe stands behind emiliani heaves against the statue
mills watches gritting his teeth rubbing the glass against the rope fingers bleeding
but both gardens were beset by problems
weeds started to take root and there were infestations of insects and diseases
the gardens started to turn putrid
and one man fought to save his garden because he could never forget how it once was
everyday he cut the weeds and killed the insects
fought the diseases
doe finally topples the statue down the altar stairs and the other end of the rope pulls mills upwards screaming in pain
mills is held about eight feet in the air legs dangling
that man never had a beautiful garden again
the other man plowed his garden under
pause he plowed it under the soil
he started over
somerset gets to his feet steadying himself on a pew
doe walks across the altar picks up a long metal pole with a thick wick and candle snuffer on the end
he lights the wick from a near candle
the flame burns long and thin
he looks down at somerset takes out his gun
stay there somerset
or ill kill him right now
doe holds the flaming pole up near mills
he looks up at mills
mills is straining
he nods to somerset and somerset sees mills cutting at the rope
you dont have to do this john
youve already made your point
do you think i chose this
can you even begin to understand how painful my existence has been
like having every sense heightened beyond comprehension
doe lowers the flame standing below and beside mills with his attention focused on somerset
so that the stench of the street coats your throat like bile
so sugar is so sweet it
it makes your bones ache to the marrow
mills continues cutting bleeding almost through the rope
he begins to swing his feet slightly his body swaying
i was chosen
and ive wished a thousand times i could have been a normal man
like david mills a common man
with a common life
but wishing that is my sin
i cant have it and i shouldnt
doe steps towards mills
dont do this
i meant what i said
i admire david mills
i envy david mills
pause envy is my sin
just as doe is to put the flame to mills the rope is finally cut through
mills drops swinging his legs forward smashing doe in the face knocking does glasses off
mills hits the floor with a thud
somerset runs forward
david get out
doe has fallen back dropping the metal pole
mills scrambles to his feet and charges at doe shouting
doe squints screaming raises his gun
the bullets catch mills in mid run and carry him off his feet backwards
somerset grips his own gun just as mills body falls tumbles off the altar area and down the stairs in front of him
somerset lets out a scream of pain and rage that chokes in his throat
he falls to his knees and halts mills body
somersets shaking unable to breathe turning mills over and cradling his head in his arms
tears come to his eyes
on the altar doe throws his gun away
he starts feeling around him unsteady looking for his glasses
mills eyes are closed
he is still bloody
with one gasp without a word he is dead
somerset looks up at doe vision blurred by rage and tears
doe stands putting on his glasses faces somerset
somerset lays mills body down
stands walks up towards the altar raises his gun
doe stands quaking teeth clenched fists balled up
he waits for the bullets falls to his knees
the gun trembles in somersets hand as somerset brings the barrel to does face
a milliseconds pause
somerset changes the angle of fire
blam he blows john does arm to pieces in a splattering explosion
doe screams falling back on the altar floor
the entire church with its candles frames the torture somerset walks to where doe flops horribly bleeding
somerset aims shoots doe in the leg
doe screams rolling trying to crawl away knocking over candle racks
he shoots does other leg
he shoots doe in the other arm
flames begin to rise and spread quickly amongst the pews
doe continues to spasm wrenching hand slapping the bloody floor
blam blam blam
somerset steps back from doe overturns a rack of candles on top of him
he steps away
flames begin rising on does clothing
does face covered in blood twisted in agony helpless flames rising
he continues screaming
his glasses crack from the heat
smoke billows from the windows
the fire is moving quickly ravenous
its just starting to light up the night
from the front door somerset walks weeping carrying mills body in his arms
the seven deadly sin tableau burns
flames cause the paint to bubble and blacken
gluttony greed and sloth are already halfway gone
flames eat at pride lust
wrath and envy are being consumed
wrath goes last
a man with bloodied hands in tones of blue
flames devour it
a field of blue
cops in orderly rows
the funeral of david mills
many police officials and politicians stand in tribute
somerset is here in his dress blue uniform
he stares forward still numb beaten
rifles are raised by a corps of riflemen
blanks explode from the barrels
they reload in unison
somerset looks towards the grace where mills casket lies under an american flag
tracy is there
tracy stands surrounded by strangers at the grave site
her head is lowered
each blast of the rifle salute causes her to react with a start
the funeral is over
somerset stands at the edge of the graveyard looking at the distant city
behind him the mourners are still filing out to their cars
the captain approaches
he comes to stand beside somerset similarly solemn
i dont know if i should do this
pause we found the motel room doe must have been staying in after you found his apartment
somerset hasnt acknowledged the captain still looking away
we found this in his belongings
the captain takes out a sealed envelope
somerset takes it
on the envelope detective somerset handwritten in red marker
tracy and somerset stand near a moving truck in front of the apartment building
movers carry tracys belongings to the truck
mills car is attached to be towed behind
i wish i could say something
pause something to
i dont know
ill be okay
well keep in touch
ill come visit
ill write to you when we get there
take care of yourself
pause take care of the baby
theres nothing left for them to say
theyre both empty
its time for them to give a gesture a kiss or a hug to say goodbye but neither makes the first move
thats all mrs
we got everything
movers latch up the back of the truck while the driver climbs in and fires up the engine
somerset walks away
tracy walks away gets in the passenger side of the moving truck
sidewalks jammed with people hurrying
somerset walks in a fog hands in his pockets
he stops at a corner but does not cross
he stands there looks up
at the city around him
the buildings towering over him
at the cars buses and taxies racing in the streets blowing their horns and spouting soot
somerset reaches into his jacket pocket takes out the envelope from john doe
he studies it in his hand
to himself oh
he opens it
he takes out a small note handwritten
it reads somerset looks up again mortified fighting to keep control of his emotions
he looks around at the miserable people walking past him
at a man at the top of the subway station stairs sitting in a cardboard box holding out a cup rattling the change inside
a father passes by holding his young sons hand
somerset turns to watch them as they pass
the gather reaches to pick the boy up and carry him
the boy holds tight
for some reason this makes somerset ache with sorrow
the father hugs his son to him kisses him on the cheek
the boy returns the kiss with great affection
somerset watches them disappear in the mass of humanity
he looks back at the note in his hand
he tears the note up into little pieces
the truck moves along in steady traffic
tracy sits beside the driver
she looks out at the city across the river
she reaches into her pocket takes out a small manila envelope
she opens the envelope and slides two keys on a keychain out into her palm
shes looking at the keys when she notices something about the envelope
she reopens it takes out a small folded piece of paper
she unfolds it it is the piece of wallpaper with the pale rose at its center
she smiles very faintly
cars roll by in the street
cops come and go
somerset walks up the stairs into the precinct house
