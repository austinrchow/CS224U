written by melissa rosenberg based on the novel by stephenie meyer february moss draped
tortured tree trunks twist upward reaching for rare sunlight
id never given much thought to how i would die
suddenly every creature in the forest is deadly silent
neither bird beast nor insect make a noise
a predator is near
then in the distance hear a tiny snick a twig snapping
abruptly were on the move
trees start whipping past us at a dizzying speed branches are dodged with preternatural agility
and were speeding up chasing something
finally up ahead we get the first glimpse of our prey running for its life as it darts through this maze of a forest
it sprints forward but we gain on it
beyond the deer see the forests edge ahead white sunlight glowing against the trees
the buck races for the light
were just behind it about to emerge from the shadowy darkness the deer leaps into the light in a high arc hovering suddenly slow motion against the white glare of
the deer abruptly plummets out of frame at an unnatural angle leaving the white glare to fill the screen
hold on whiteness but dying in the place of someone i love seems like a good way to go
then into the whiteness steps the face of eyes closed against the sunlight absorbing its rays
long dark hair frames alabaster skin
shes a vulnerable introverted imperfect beauty
so i cant bring myself to regret the decision that brought me here to die
the background comes into focus as we realize were now in
bella stands at the end of a cul de sac on the deserts edge
the sun blazes behind her she bends down and carefully scoops a tiny barrel cactus into a clay pot
the decision to leave home
she stares at the cactus in a state of reverie until bye bella
bellas pov mcmansion across the street three tanned athletic blonde girls hop into a convertible mercedes
their flawless bought and paid for beauty contrasts with bellas pale naturalness
good luck at your new school
they adlib superficial good wishes dont forget to write well miss you
bella waves back sweetly but halfheartedly as she steps off the curb
have a good
when she rights herself theyre already gone
clearly not close friends
bellas grown up demeanor and innate intelligence become apparent as bellas mother rene mid s exits their house its low rent for this ritzy neighborhood
rene is eclectic scattered anxious more best friend than parent
she thrusts a cell phone at bella
it wont work again baby
you put it on hold
you also called mexico
rene pushes her playfully they laugh
ill figure it out
you gotta be able to reach me and phil on the road love saying that on the road
phil good looking with an athletes body exits the house carrying bellas three suitcases with ease
if you call crappy motels backwater towns and ballpark hot dogs romantic
he puts his phoenix desert dogs baseball hat on renes head with kiss
phils love of rene reassures bella
phil heads to the old station wagon to load the luggage while rene slips her arm through bellas clinging to her as they walk to car
now you know if you change your mind ill race back here from wherever the game is
but renes strained expression tells us what a great sacrifice that would be
bella forces a smile
i wont change my mind mom
youve always hated forks
its not about forks its about dad
i mean two weeks a year we barely know each other
off renes still worried look mom i want to go
ill be fine
but as rene hugs bella we see the truth on bellas face dread doubt regret
off bella struggling to keep her facade up as she climbs into the back seat of the car
bella ipod earbuds in her ears gets a last glimpse of the sparkling malls chic shoppers manicured cactus gardens
the mcmansions get smaller as we sweep over the scorched landscape baking under a hot sun
beyond the housing developments see the rocky dry desert extending for miles
rise higher and higher still until finally were suspended within the bright perfect blue sky with only an occasional cloud
slowly the clouds start getting more numerous thicker darker
until were completely immersed in them
the sun disappearing
finally we emerge from the clouds to find below nothing but deep dark green forests for miles
sweep down finding the eerily dramatic lake crescent
over it all hangs the mist from the ever present cloudy grey sky
everything is wet and green and drenched in shade
find a two lane highway along which drives a police cruiser
push in on the cruiser until we reach bella looks out taking in her gloomy new surroundings
bella sits next to her uniformed father police chief charlie swan s
taciturn introverted like bella
their strained silence contrasts bellas relationship with her mother
your hairs longer
i cut it since last time i saw you
guess it grew out again
she just nods
hows your mom
they pass a sign the city of forks welcomes you pop
as the cruiser drives through bella takes in this logging town every storefront has a wood carving
the timber museums sign is two loggers sawing a stump
the police station is a small wooden building across from city hall
the cruiser pulls up to the old two story house
a woodshed full of firewood
theres a small boat in the garage fishing gear an old buoy
bella climbs out
bella and charlie carry in her bags
the house isnt stylish the only new thing here is a flat screen t
but its comfortable lived in
lots of fishing memorabilia photos of charlie fishing with quileute indian billy black
handmade cards to daddy and photos of bella
she winces at herself age in a tutu sitting stubbornly on the ground
i put grandpas old desk in your room
and i cleared some shelves in the bathroom
grimacing thats right
bellas eye lands on a photo of a much younger charlie and rene on vacation beaming with love
ill just put these up in your room i can do it they both reach for the bags bumping one another awkwardly
bella backs off letting charlie carry the bags upstairs
an antique rolltop desk sits in a corner
the room is filled with childhood remnants that have seen better days
as she unpacks her cd case loneliness finally overwhelms her
she sits heavily on the edge of the bed tears threatening
then we hear a honk outside
bella runs across the hall and looks out the window to see outside a faded red truck circa pulls up
bella exits to find charlie greeting the driver jacob black quileute indian amiable with long black hair and hints of childish roundness in his face
the two of them help jacobs father billy black from the photos into a wheelchair
bella you remember billy black
glad youre finally here
charlie hasnt shut up about it since you told him you were coming
keep exaggerating ill wheel you down the hill
right after i ram you in the ankles
billy takes several rolls at charlie who dodges
jacob shakes his head at their two fathers as he shyly approaches bella
we made mud pies together when we were little kids
i think i remember
re the dads are they always like this
its getting worse with old age
charlie then pats the hood of the truck addressing bella so what do you think of your homecoming gift
the truck is for me
just bought it off billy here
i rebuilt the engine and its perfect
its the first genuine smile weve seen on her
she rushes to the truck
jacob eagerly joins her
okay so you gotta double pump the clutch when you shift but he hands her the keys as she climbs in
maybe i can give you a ride to school
i go to school on the reservation
wouldve been nice to know at least one person
as she starts up the truck we match cut loud belching and turning heads as bella parks mortified
all eyes are on her as she climbs out of her truck and steps in puddle soaking her sneakers
she slinks toward school as we begin bella never without her ipod makes her way thru kids who stare openly a few brave ones say hi
theyre all talking about her
this is her hell
bella wanders the walkways looking for room numbers lost
constant stares at bella the outsider
series ends when a sweet nerd cute motor mouth boy eric appears in her path
youre isabella swan the new girl
the eyes and ears of this place
anything you need
tour guide lunch date shoulder to cry on
bella just looks at him
is he for real
im kind of the suffer in silence type
good headline for your feature im on the paper and youre news baby front page
i no im not news im seriously not at all whoa chillax
relieved would you mind just pointing me toward mr
he leads her away enjoying the attentive stares as she cringes from them youve missed a lot of the semester but i can hook you up tutor cliff notes medical
the boys basketball team runs drills on half the basketball court
a girls volleyball game occupies the other half
bella in gym clothes avoids the volleyball like its radioactive
an energetic athletic team captain jessica motivates the players
block it chloe
unfortunately the volleyball heads toward bella
she closes her eyes and flails at it smacking it
it flies off court and beans a basketball player in the head
he is mike newton good looking affable with blond spiky hair
hurries to him embarrassed are you alright
i warned them not to make me play
its only a flesh wound
mike grins and she smiles relieved
a bell rings class over
youre isabella right
he looks at her a second too long clearly taken by her suddenly jessica appears stepping between them
subtle but possessive as she nudges mike
shes got a great spike doesnt she
to bella so youre from arizona right
arent people supposed to be tan down there
thats why they kicked me out
mike laughs and because he does jessica does
bella just feels uncomfortable with the attention
follow bella mike and jessica as they carry their trays to table
eric appears and squishes into a seat next to bella
mike you met my home girl bella
your home girl
to bella its first grade all over again and youre the shiny new toy
bella smiles awkwardly
suddenly a flashbulb blinds bella
she looks up at the photographer angela jessicas sweet low key insecure friend
sorry needed a candid for the feature features dead angela
dont bring it up again
to bella i got your back baby
disappointed guess well just run another editorial on teen drinking
theres always eating disorders or speedo padding on the swim team wait thats a good one
but bellas attention is now riveted to they swing open as four of the most astounding people bellas ever seen enter in slow motion the cullens
two guys two girls all chalky pale purplish shadows under their eyes
and all devastatingly beautiful
they move through the room with effortless grace and take a seat at a table furthest from bellas
bella leans over to jessica and angela
who are they
jessica leans in swinging into gossip mode
doctor and mrs
cullens foster kids
they all moved down here from alaska two years ago
they kinda keep to themselves
because theyre all together
like together together
the blonde girl rosalie and the big dark haired guy emmett
on rosalie long blonde hair model beautiful knows it
alongside her is emmett big brawny like a weight lifter but a playful glint in his eye
theyre a thing
im not even sure thats legal
jess theyre not actually related
but they live together
and the little dark haired girl alice shes really weird
on alice pixie like rail thin light on her feet with short black hair going in every direction
she hovers over jasper honey blond hair tall lean slightly tortured
shes with jasper the blonde who looks like hes in pain
cullens like this foster dad slash match maker
maybe hell adopt me
bella laughs liking her
then sees the last cullen to enter edward
lanky with untidy bronze colored hair
he seems inwardly turned mysterious
more boyish than the others
but the most striking of all
bella cant take her eyes off him
thats edward cullen
suddenly edward looks over as if he heard jessica from across the room
his eyes meet bellas
but he seems
bella quickly looks away
hes totally gorgeous obviously
but apparently no one here is good enough for him
like i care
she obviously does anyway dont waste your time
i wasnt planning on it
but bella cant help but peek at edward again
hes staring at her outright now with a slightly frustrated expression that unnerves bella
she hides behind her hair
a room of black topped lab tables
two to a table
bella and mike enter
mike takes his seat and points her toward mr
molina birkenstocked enthusiastic science teacher at the head of the class
as bella moves to the teacher with her class slip she notes edward his back to her sitting at a front table
but as she passes edwards table
slow motion the breeze she creates when she passes lifts piece of paper next to edward
were still on his back as he inhales then abruptly stiffens
he grabs onto the edge of the table crumbling it slightly
no one notices
molina takes bellas class slip
follow along as best you can till you get caught up
molina gestures to the only empty seat
next to edward
but as bella approaches shes taken aback when on edwards face he slowly looks up at her his eyes coal black with repulsion fury
if looks could literally kill
bella knocks someones book bag off their chair
replaces it mumbling an apology
then slinks reluctantly into her seat
edward jerks away from her to the extreme edge of his chair
to the class animated today well be observing the behavior of planaria a
molina distributes two petri dishes per table were going to cut them in half then watch them regenerate into two separate worms
bella glances at edward who averts his face holding a hand over his nose as if he smells something horrible
bella shrinking subtly sniffs the air smells nothing
then she sniffs her hair
molina hands edward two petri dishes
yes folks zombie worms
they just wont die
edward takes a dish then slides the second one across the table to bella as if she had ebola
she takes her dish and makes a dark curtain of her hair between them
she can see edwards hands under the table
clenched into fists
off bella utterly baffled and deeply insecure
as the bell rings edward bolts out the door
other kids and bella exit a moment later
bella looks down the hall hes gone
bella enters but nearly turns and leaves when she sees edward sweet talking the enchanted female administrator s
he doesnt see bella enter
there must be something open sixth period
no every class is full
im afraid youll have to stay in biology
im so sorry
the administrator sees her and gestures for her to wait a minute
but edward suddenly straightens as if sensing bella
he slowly turns to glare at her with piercing hate filled eyes
she backs to the wall hugging herself suddenly chilled
to the administrator ill just
he strides out the door
edward climbs into a shiny new silver volvo with the cullens while bella upset hurries to her truck
the many eyes still watching her add insult to injury
finally she reaches and closes the door
her eyes well
but she fights it getting mad
as she tries to start the car choking the engine we begin to hear a mans ragged frightened breath
extremely tight on his terrified face sweat dripping breathing in short gasps trying desperately not to make a sound
include hes crouched in a dark corner
but then he sees a shadow move blindingly fast past him
he jerks around then another shadow flies past too fast to follow
he runs up a flight of stairs harsh lights from the exterior of the mill striating him
he moves as fast as humanly possible unknown pov charges after him at an inhuman speed through this maze of pillars and walkways
we dodge skull crushing beams leap from one floor up to the next up ladders scaffolding beams up and up getting closer and closer to who desperately runs for his
life looking over his shoulder with terror
unknown pov is closing in on him but then he bolts out a door the guard bursts out onto a stair landing but loses his footing and trips breaking through
the rail and pitching over the side into the air and stops hovering mid air a yard from the landing
hand grips his shirt then yanks him out of the air and out of frame with incredible strength
his guttural scream is choked short as blood sprays the landing
on a top sirloin steak as it is set in front of charlie
he shares a table with bella
include the waitress cora s
she beams at bella as she sets a plate of cod in front of her
several loggers at the counter offer bella welcoming smiles
she shrinks in her seat at the attention
cant get over how grown up you are
and so gorgeous
bella glances at charlie who keeps his eyes on his steak
bearded hippy logger waylon forge appears behind cora leaning over her shoulder to bella
member me honey
i was santa one year
waylon she hasnt had a christmas here since she was four
bet i made an impression though
you always do
let the girl eat her cod waylon
to bella when youre done ill bring your favorite berry cobbler
your dad still has it
doesnt remember at all thatd be great thank you
cora shoos waylon away
left alone now charlie and bella both reach for the salt knock hands
charlie goes for the ketchup instead
silence as they eat
a burst of laughter from a nearby happy family only serves to emphasize their discomfort
bella tries to bridge the gap
you eat here every night
easier than washing dishes
i can cook
he looks up as if confused by the concept
i do the cooking at home in phoenix
moms not great in the kitchen
they both laugh recalling an especially bad dinner
how was school
a few people
do you know the cullen family
looks up sharply are people talking about them again
well a little
just cause theyre newcomers
were lucky to have a surgeon like dr
cullen at our podunk hospital
lucky his wife wanted to live in a small town
lucky his kids arent like lot of the hell raisers around here
i just dont like narrow mindedness
and he returns to his food
bella looks out at the fog as she talks on the phone
if spring training goes well we could be living in florida permanently
please insert cents to continue
mom wheres your cell
rene talks on a pay phone her dead cell phone in her hand
in the b
phil and an attendant work on the subaru engine
ok i didnt lose my power cord
it ran away
i literally repel technology now
bella smiles missing her mom
rene feeds the phone quarters
now tell me more about your school baby
what are the kids like
are there any cute guys
are they being nice to you
a beat lying theyve all been really
push in on bellas face getting mad all over again as
on bella sitting atop a table an open book in her lap
but her eyes are on the arriving kids and the parking lot as they pull in
shes waiting for edward
jessica angela mike and eric kick around a soccerball nearby
they wave bella to join them but she smiles declining
and returns to watching for edward
her face tells us shes ready for a confrontation
bella strides in
but stops surprised to find her lab table empty
off bella frustrated
bella sits with jessica and angela who watch a youtube video on their phone
bella gives it a cursory look but is focused on the cullen table only four of them
edwards seat is empty
bella washes her hands then looks up at the mirror startled to find rosalie and alice behind her
they study bella rosalie with chillingly cold eyes alice with curiosity
bella uneasy hurries out
bella exits with angela mike jessica and eric becoming a part of this circle
she now only glances at rosalies car a red m bmw as it drives past noting again four cullens no edward
bella returns to her friends finally forgetting about him
series of scenes ends as we go to its neater rearranged more attractively
clearly bellas given it her touch
she sweeps through folding charlies fleece jacket straightening up
she grabs her book bag dad im heading out
on bellas face as she opens the door and stops dismay filling her
its pouring down rain the yard is full of puddles some frozen
bella shivers wraps her coat tight
whip pan to the driveway as charlie pulls in driving her truck
dad i can drive myself to school
as she walks down the steps she doesnt realize somethings watching her tracking bellas every move as she slips and falls on patch of ice back on bella fallen on
charlie climbs out of the truck helps her up
you okay bells
ice doesnt help the uncoordinated
thats why i got you new tires
she looks over at the truck yep four new tires
the other ones were nearly bald
you got me new tires
no ones ever done that before
charlie looks at her confused
he clearly doesnt get it as heads toward his cruiser
ill be late for dinner
im heading down to mason county
a security guard at the grisham mill got killed by some kind of animal
unknown pov on bella and charlie as he speaks
youre not in phoenix any more honey
theyve been hunting it for a week with no luck
thought id lend a hand
and thank you
for the tires
he sees emotion in her eyes
doesnt understand it but nods heads inside
bella looks at the tires again oddly moved
rain beats on the roof as eric walks bella into class
she brushes water off her coat as he chats her up
and yeah prom committee is chick thing but i gotta cover it for the paper anyway and they need a guy to help choose the music so i need your
bella is about to respond when mike comes up behind her
come on arizona
give it up for the rain
and he shakes his wet baseball cap onto bellas head
she heads toward her seat brushing off her hair
but she freezes when she sees edward
bella straightens girding herself
then strides to the table and confidently drops her books down ready to address him
but he looks up at her hello
he is direct precise as if every word is an effort for him
i didnt have a chance to introduce myself last week
my name is edward cullen
shes too shocked that hes talking to her to answer
prompting youre bella
feeling like an idiot she quickly sits
he abruptly moves to the extreme edge of his seat
shes even more baffled now
to the class onion root tip cells
thats whats on your slides
separate and label them into the phases of mitosis
the first partners to get it right win
the golden onion
he excitedly holds up a spray painted onion
everyone just looks at him
hes disappointed by their apathy
come on people
everyone sets to work
edward pushes the microscope to bella keeping his distance his voice controlled
she grabs the microscope defensively and snaps the first slide in adjusting the lens
shes curt as she addresses him
youve been gone
out of town
for personal reasons
she glances at him but he just leans far away his face tight
she looks back into the microscope
she begins to remove the slide
may i look
she slides him the microscope
he glances through the lens
muttering like i said
he writes it on the worksheet
then he takes a breath as if trying calm himself and turns to her with enormous effort
enjoying the rain
youre asking me about the weather
i dont like the cold
or the wet
or the gray
or turtle necks
is that a smile playing on his lips
for the first time he seems more intrigued than agonized
he studies her
she still cant tell if he despises her or not
he shakes his head and turns to the microscope switching out the slides
she looks at him
and keeps looking
his cheekbones his lips
so perfect like a sculpture
she snaps out of it
covers with a dry look
she looks through the lens anaphase
like i said
she glances at him and this time sees a smirk
she simply holds out her hand for another slide
handing her the slide if you hate cold and rain why move to the wettest place in the continental u
i think i can keep up
he actually seems interested
she looks into the microscope as my mother remarried
so you dont like him
phil is fine
young for her but nice enough
re the slide interphase
bella exits holding the golden onion and practically runs into edward whos directly in front of her
why didnt you stay with your mom and stepdad
he waits for her answer studying her as if trying to decipher her
shes drawn in by his attention oddly compelled
alright phils a minor league baseball player so he travels lot
my mother stayed home with me but it made her unhappy
so decided to spend time with my father
but now youre unhappy
i i just
bella turns away embarrassed vulnerable
im just trying to figure you out
youre very hard to read
hes clearly trying to read her now
their eyes meet again
but now she looks more closely at him
did you get contacts
your eyes were black before now theyre this golden brown or its just the fluorescents
he abruptly turns and walks away
as he does bella notes his hands clenched into tight fists
off bella utterly bewildered both intrigued and frustrated
the rain has stopped but the parking lot is full of water and patches of black ice
shivering bella heads for her truck carrying the onion carefully navigating the icy puddles
as she reaches her truck she looks across the lot edward stands by his silver volvo with his siblings about to climb in
a moment as their eyes meet
then he looks toward the sound of a high pitched screech that quickly grows louder
bella turns to see a van skidding on the ice careening out of control heading directly for her
time suddenly fractures compressing to stillness then exploding in bursts of speed as the faces of the students in shock seeing whats coming
the van drivers face tyler desperately trying to gain control then shielding his face
edwards face looking at bella with horror
the van is about to hit bellas truck with her standing in between when suddenly something knocks bella down pinning her to the ground
she looks up edward is on top of her
the world around them freezes in this fraction of second their proximity is overwhelming electrifying
he breathes in her scent she takes in his flawless face
abruptly we blast back to speed as several things happen so quickly we and bella are unsure whats going on the van smashes into the back of bellas truck then
spins around once again careening toward her and edward then suddenly edwards hands are creating a deep dent in the side of the vans body as it shudders to a stop a foot from bella
edward literally pushes the van away
a long beat void of any sound as bella looks at edward trying to absorb what just happened
edwards fear for her is still alive on his face
she starts to speak but
the screaming begins yelling calls for help
people leap to tylers aid run to bella and edward
bella sees the onion on the ground smashed as she would have been
as everyone sweeps in edward moves into the b
mike and eric run to bella are you okay
are you what happened
did anyone hurt
see what happened
amid the chaos bella sees edwards siblings looking at edward
but they show no hint of concern for his safety
instead they look at him with disapproval
the double doors burst open as charlie runs in face white with terror
bella sitting on a gurney the e
doctor looking into her eyes with a pen light
on the next gurney over tyler the vans driver lies with a mild head wound
charlie rushes up
are you alright
im fine dad
im so sorry bella
i tried to stop
its okay tyler
it sure as hell is not okay
dad its not his fault stern cutting her off we nearly lost you
but you didnt
hed hug her if that was who he or who she was
instead he glares at tyler
you can kiss your license goodbye
i heard the chiefs daughter was here
they look up as dr
carlisle cullen mid s approaches blond movie star handsome
his face is kind but pale tired
doctor ive got this one jackie
doctor hands dr
cullen the chart exits
cullen reviews her chart then feels the back of her head as
you have a nice knot growing back there but your x rays show no indication of concussion
im so sorry bella
im really charlie abruptly pulls the curtain between them
it would have been a lot worse if edward hadnt knocked me out of the way
cullen quickly looks back at the chart
bellas intuition flickers sensing he knows something
it was amazing he got to me so fast
he was nowhere near me
smiles as long as youre safe
charlie and bella exit the treatment area
i just have to sign some paperwork
you better call your mom
you told her
shes probably freaking
he shrugs and hurries off
bella shakes her head pulls out her cell phone
is about to dial but then sees down the hall
rosalie is clearly furious at edward who stands his ground
cullen plays intermediary
this isnt just about you its about all of us dr
cullen sees bella and stops rosalie lets take this in my office
rosalie glares at edward as she goes off with dr
edward adopts a nonchalant air as bella approaches determined
can i talk to you for a moment
off his nod how did you get over to me so quickly
i was standing right next to you
you were next to your car across the lot
he steps closer to her
his expression turns icy hard
no i wasnt
she wont be bullied
steps closer to him
you hit your head
i know what i saw
and what exactly was that
you stopped that van
you pushed it away
no one will believe that
i wasnt planning to tell anyone
this registers with edward
theyre inches from each other the tension thick
i just want to know the truth
cant you just thank me and get over it
a long beat as they look at each other angry defensive
and without a doubt attracted
youre not going to let it go are you
turns walks away then i hope you enjoy disappointment
why did you even bother
he stops a beat
looks back at her unexpectedly vulnerable
i dont know
and he keeps walking
off bella confused frustratingly attracted and absolutely determined to find out the truth
that was the first night i dreamed of edward cullen
bella swims white skin aglow hair floating weightlessly sensually
suddenly something blasts past her
something blasts behind her
she spins again to find herself face to face with edward
bella reaches for him but he abruptly springs backward just out of reach
as she bolts up awake
in that split second in the darkness she sees edward watching her
she snaps on the light the room is empty
was she dreaming
bella stands in the exact spot of the accident
behind her on the lawn several classes congregate gathering for field trip
molina is in charge
make sure i get your permission slips
push in on bellas face staring at the skid marks on the pavement
back on bella blushing at the memory
then she sees edward arrive with alice and jasper
she watches him barely noticing as mike trots up to her ala dr
yeah false alarm
actually im glad youre not dead cause well that would suck plus wanted to ask you even though its like a month away
but bellas distracted by edward
mikes voice dips as
edward head down is in quiet conference with jasper and alice
abruptly he looks up as if listening to her and mike though hes too far away to hear
bella quickly refocuses on mike
so what do you think
off her blank look you want to go
realizing horrified prom
as in dance
i uh have to go somewhere
you cant go another weekend
non refundable ticket
maybe you should ask jessica
mike follows bellas eyes way across the lawn to jessica
she smiles at them suddenly edward crosses in front of jessica
he seems to be smirking
molina and a tour guide lead several dozen kids through the greenhouse
bella keeps an eye on edward whos up ahead with alice and jasper
molina demonstrates the compost machine as the students mess around
cmon eric stuff that compost down deep
the machine gurgles and spins now tyler take a big steaming cup of compost tea
this is recycling at its most basic level hey dont drink that
when bella sees edward pause by an ancient staghorn fern alone she takes a breath for courage and strides up to him
he glances at her merely nodding
we notice his fists clench and unclench
bella looks at him appalled by his rudeness
she turns starts to walk away
whats in jacksonville
she turns back to him
how did you know about that
you didnt answer my question
you havent answered any of mine
you wont even say hello
and how did you stop that van
not buying it floridians
thats whats in jacksonville
she turns to storm off but she stumbles over the irrigation hose
edward steadies her catching her scent still so powerful
he clenches his jaw
it helps if you actually watch where you put your feet
insulted she keeps moving
he keeps pace serious now
i know ive been rude but its for the best
she just looks at him like hes crazy
he walks away as jessica suddenly rushes up
guess who just asked me to prom
i totally thought mike was going to ask you bella
is it gonna be weird
you guys are great together
i know right
giddy jessica rushes to catch up with angela
bella heads out the door that leads to where everyones looking at the compost worm box grossing each other out with the slimy creatures
as bella backs away edward steps up
bella it would be better if we werent friends
wounded too bad you didnt figure that out earlier
bella contd you could have let the van crush me and saved yourself all this regret
snapping angry you think i regret saving you
i know you do
furious you dont know anything
his harshness stings her
suddenly alice appears at edwards side
she eyes bella with curiosity
the bus is leaving
to bella hi
will you be riding with us
our bus is full
he purposefully walks alice away
but he glances back at bella with is that
she doesnt see it
bella enters throws down her book bag and coat still angry
she starts upstairs but charlie enters from the kitchen
your mother called
your fault for telling her about the accident
she always did know how to worry
hint of sadness but
shes changed too
she seems happy
phil sounds all right
she continues upstairs glancing at her parents wedding photo
off bellas face we match cut
as she pushes through the doors
she glances over at the cullen table edward with his siblings
he doesnt look at her
anger and determination set in again as bella joins eric jessica mike and angela
she drops her book bag on a seat la push baby
should i know what that means
la push beach down on the quileute rez
were all going after school
big swell coming in
and i dont just surf the internet
eric you stood up once
on a foam board
theres whale watching too
la push baby
ill go if you stop saying that
bella artfully designs an architectural salad
as she reaches for an apple edward is suddenly next to her charmed edible art
startled she fumbles and drops the apple edward catches it with his foot hackeysack style then bounces it back into his hand the red of the apple stark against his
he presents it to her with small smile
but your mood swings are giving me whiplash
i said it would be better if we werent friends not that i didnt want to be
what does that even mean
it means if you were smart youd avoid me
edward inadvertently glances at his four inhumanly beautiful siblings who wait for him expectantly at their table
she notes her own very human friends monitoring this conversation from their table
mike glowers jealously
so lets say for arguments sake that im not smart
would you talk to me
tell me the truth
id rather hear your theories
how bout radioactive spiders
levels his gaze challenging youre talking about superheroes
what if im not a hero
what if im a bad guy
beat looking closer at him no
i dont believe that
youre not bad
you can be a jerk but its like this
to keep people away
hes taken aback by her honesty her insight drawn in by her
look why dont we just hang out
come to the beach with us
itll be fun sand fleas wind burn salt water stinging your eyes
small smile considering it which beach
his smile lessens almost imperceptibly
is something wrong with that beach
edward glances over at mike the two exchange cold looks
its just a little crowded
off bella as edward walks away
its freezing but mike tyler jessica and others suit up for a surf
eric hangs with them
bella wanders by the driftwood with angela who takes photographs
i keep thinking erics going to ask me to prom then he just
you could ask him
off angelas flustered look take control
youre a strong independent woman
she looks up to see three quileute boys approaching the group jacob black and sam and embry
bella smiles at jacob
guys this is jacob
are you stalking me
youre on my rez remember
teasing keep her company
her date bailed
she invited edward
embarrassed to be polite
i think its nice she invited him
no one ever does
because cullens a freak
you got that right
you know them
sharply the cullens dont come here
jacob shoots sam a look shakes his head
bella registers this
a beat then she casually pulls jacob aside you want to go look at tide pools
she offers an awkwardly flirtatious smile
he grins infatuated
as they head toward the water
bella and jacob wander near the water looking out to sea for whales
the surfers are out on the waves
she nudges him continuing her attempt at flirtation
so what did your friend mean about the cullens not coming here
caught that huh
he moves closer to her lowering his voice for mock secrecy
im not supposed to say anything
bella gives him her best alluring smile
i can keep a secret
laughing its just an old scary story
did you know the quileutes are supposedly descended from wolves
like fur fangs
bella smiles and prompts him to continue
so the legend about the cullens is
well theyre supposedly descended from this like
in a spooky voice enemy clan
but they claimed to be different so we made a treaty with them
didnt they just move here
or just moved back
so what was this treaty
whispering if they promised to stay off quileute lands we wouldnt expose what they really were to the pale faces
jacob pauses dramatically bella shivers
bella jumps at the bloodcurdling scream as angela runs past chased by eric waving a dead crustacean
jacob smirks and starts back to the group
what were they really
laughing its just a story bella
off bella with more unanswered questions
a collection of haphazard shacks and boat docks connected by wood plank sidewalks
find waylon forge the hippy logger who used to play santa claus scraping paint off his boat swigging a pint as he listens to his prehistoric walkman
his old dog lies next to him as the sounds of the forest and river chirp and buzz
waylon sings along to his walkman
suddenly the sounds of nature abruptly silence themselves
the dog raises his head starts to growl
waylon doesnt notice
stay on waylon singing working
until he looks up and realizes the dogs gone
waylon pulls off the headphones
waylon walks up a walkway
then sees a dog leg sticking out from under a bush
come on jerry you old mutt
he pulls at the leg
he reels back stumbling onto his boat frantically untying the line and pushing out on the water waylon floats breath short listening acutely
waylons pov on the woods lining the river
he jerks around
then suddenly his boat rocks violently he spins a man now stands on the bow
james pale white
but his eyes unlike the cullens are a deep sinister burgundy and absolutely lethal
his catlike movements are always on the edge of a crouch
h how did you do that
always the same inane questions
waylon turns but a woman leaps onto the bow its victoria chaotic red hair filled with leaves from the woods
terrified waylon spins around to see laurent glossy black hair olive skin lounging on his boat seat
all three nomads wear frayed clothes and all three are bare foot
what do you want
why are you doing this
sighs slight french accent james must we
the question should be will it hurt
victoria grins sadistically
then with lightening fast speed the three of them violently lunge snapshots of his eyes his cheekbones his lips
as she sits in front of her computer lost in thought
she shakes herself out of it and types into her search engine quileute legends olympic peninsula
an ad pops up thunderbird whale book store port angeles
bella intrigued clicks on it
the sun has come out and so has the skin
kids are in shorts though its still barely sixty degrees
everyone eats lunch outdoors
bella searches the crowd for edward
hes not here
she looks down to find jessica sitting on the grass
whenever the weathers nice the cullens disappear
cullen yank em out for hiking and camping and stuff
i tried the idea out on my parents
not even close
bella registers this as angela suddenly jumps on them
im going to the prom with eric
just asked him i took control
hugs bella are you sure you have to go out of town
its a family thing
oh my god we need to hit the stores in port angeles before the dresses get cleaned out
a plan forming in her mind can i go with you guys
we need your opinion
off bella thats not really what she had in mind
antsy distracted as jessica and angela try on dresses
bella pulls a mapquest print out from her purse it reads thunderbird and whale book store
jessica flounces out of the changing room posing provocatively
i think this halter makes my boobs look big
what do you think bella
outside the window a group of rowdy frat boys head toward bar
two of them stare at jessica in her low cut dress
embarrassed she turns back to bella
absently it looks great
you said that about the last five dresses
empathetic youre not very good at this are you
maybe i should just go check out the book store and meet you at the restaurant later
bella nods heads out
jessicas looks in the mirror again
she was right about this halter though
it does look great
bella exits thumbing through a book she just bought
she heads down the sidewalk but then hears footsteps behind her
she turns doesnt see anyone
she puts the book in her shoulder bag and continues
unknown pov on bella someones following her
she looks around changing course to cut across a parking lot
unknown pov gets closer
and closer until she reaches isolated
bella breath short scared turns around just as two men emerge from the shadows not vampires but the frat boys really wasted now
she looks to her left the other two guys are there
she takes her purse from around her shoulder
look just take my bag
we dont want your bag
she takes a defensive stance and wraps the strap around her wrist to use her purse as a mace
they chortle derisively
but when frat boy comes near she swings it hits him in the groin
the book in her bag doubles him over
the other three laugh and start to close in
but suddenly headlights blind them
a silver volvo screeches up
the frat boys dive out of the way
the passenger side door opens
shes too stunned to even move
she finally does
but frat boy jumps into the game and rushes edwards side of the car edward screeches to a halt and is out of the car and facing frat boy so
fast neither the frat boys nor bella see it
nor does bella see edwards glare so chilling so animalistic in its fury that frat boy scared instinctively backs off
as edward climbs back into the car bella just stares at him
bella continues to stare
she sees that hes seething with anger hands gripping the steering wheel jaw clenched
what no how did you find through gritted teeth i should go back and rip their heads off
you dont know the vile repulsive things they were thinking
and you do
covering not hard to guess
jessica and angela exit the restaurant as bella approaches
where were you
we left you a message
we waited but we were starving then they see edward behind her climbing out of his car
they freeze agog
hes composed now making an effort to be charming
and they are charmed
sorry i kept bella from dinner
we ran into each other and got talking
i we understand
we were just
leaving so the two girls start to go
bella is forced to go with them
she starts to follow the girls
edward is torn then abruptly abruptly maybe i should make sure bella gets something to eat
off bellas surprised look if youd like
then i could drive you back myself
debates then decides i could eat
as he guides her off the two girls share a look and noiseless scream of excitement
bella and edward sit on the deck
a dramatic waterfall shimmers behind them
a waitress places a steaming plate of mesquite roasted salmon in front of bella and nothing in front of edward
youre not eating
im on a special diet
like south beach
she looks at him curiously as she takes a bite
so how bout some answers
to get to the other side and point
i didnt ask for the square root of pi
you knew that
how did you know where i was
she shakes her head frustrated and turns to go inside stops her sincerely dont go
he seems torn by some internal dilemma
were you following me
i feel very protective of you
so thats a yes
yes i followed you
i tried to keep my distance
until you needed help
putting everything together you said before
that you heard what those guys were thinking
shrugs im thinking of getting a nine hundred number
trying to grasp alright so you read minds
what am i thinking
wait okay now go
i have no idea
i can read every mind in there except yours
points at people inside work sex money sex sex boyfriend points at bella nothing
its quite frustrating
why whats wrong with me
i tell you i read minds and you think theres something wrong with you
he smiles charmed by her
but his smile fades that torn look returns
he holds onto the rail looking out
what is it
dont have the strength to stay away from you anymore
edward you dont have to
hes drawn in by her encouraging gaze
but he closes his eyes a beat and turns back to the water
almost to himself this is wrong
edward youre cold
we should go
he walks away before she can ask any more questions
edwards volvo speeds along the two lane highway
bella glances at edward might ask him more questions but he seems to be wrestling with his own thoughts
i think im warm enough now
she reaches for the heater dial he does as well their hands touch
and hold a moment too long
an electric current connecting them
your hand its still freezing cold
he pulls his hand away but she keeps looking at it
then her attention shifts outside to flashing police lights
as they drive past the forks police station a sheriffs car pulls away
charlies cruiser is parked out front
concerned dads here late
something must have happened
the volvo pulls up
bella and edward climb out
edward then sees a second car next to the cruiser
thats my fathers car
whats he in a pool of light a distressed charlie and dr
cullen study photographs and evidence
as they wrap up their discussion dr
cullen puts a sympathetic hand on charlies shoulder then exits the police station looking grim
waylon forge was found in the woods out near his place
i just examined the body
bella is horrified
the same kind that killed the security guard down in mason
edward and dr
cullen trade a look subtle but bella catches it
so its getting closer to town
waylon lived all the way down on queets river
but thats with a kind reassuring smile bella you should go inside
waylon was your fathers friend
she goes to the door but looks back to see them conferring quietly gravely
clearly theres more to this
bella enters to find a distressed charlie studying evidence photos maps trying to make sense of waylons death
deputies come and go in the background
bella approaches charlie
he looks up
dad im sorry about waylon
known him going on thirty years
hes obviously torn up
bella isnt quite sure what to do
and so puts a comforting hand on his shoulder
then charlie squeezes her hand
its the first physical affection weve seen between them
and it threatens to evoke even more emotion in charlie
so he tamps it down and rises then projects a confident manner
well get to the bottom of this bella
but in the meantime
as an ambulance pulls up outside he opens a drawer finds out a cannister of pepper spray
i want you to have this
thats probably not a good
itll give me some peace of mind
she sees he needs this and allows him to put it into her purse
as charlie goes to get his coat bella steps outside to see two attendants hoist a metal gurney into an ambulance
on it waylons dead white bloody bare feet peek out from under sheet resting at a disturbingly unnatural angle
off bella chilled
flash pop to the five cullens slow motion beautiful and white
as she turns on the light
she hears a snap
outside the window
she rises digs into her purse for the pepper spray charlie gave her and goes to the window
she looks out all she sees is the wind blowing hard
but shes rattled
she closes the curtains then reaches for the book she bought earlier
she thumbs through laying the pepper spray within reach
as she leafs through we see photos of ancient carved masks
comical menacing haunting
then she stops on a photo of white mask with black eyes and a row of sharp teeth
the inscription reads the cold one
bella quickly goes to her computer and googles cold one several beer ads appear
frustrated she closes the pop ups revealing a link to the cold one apotamkin several pictures begin loading the seductive apotamkin with his ice blue skin devouring his victims in
tapestries engravings paintings
creatures beautiful and horrific
craven skeletal demons attacking villages perfectly sculpted predators luring innocent maidens
its all murder blood sexuality
then several words leap out in quick succession
then finally blood drinker
and we land on a picture of a handsome man biting a womans back on bella she reels back from the computer in utter disbelief
its not possible
off bellas face struggling to make sense of it all
she stands in the center of the deserted green lawn
her expression tells us shes still reeling with disbelief
stay the bell rings and students exit class rushing past bella as she stands still waiting
cross the lawn heading to class
edward sees bella sees the intensity on her face
she walks to him eyes meeting his
her look says we have to talk
and she continues directly past him into the dark forest that borders the school
he watches her disappear in the trees then takes a step to follow
jasper moves in front of him rosalie grabs his arm
edward dont go
but alice gently removes rosalies hand from his arm
hes already there
bella stands amid the trees waiting
then the sounds of the forest abruptly drop out
a predator is near
edward appears behind her
she doesnt turn around
youre impossibly fast
your skin is pale white ice cold
your eyes change color
and sometimes you speak like
youre from a different time
turns to face him now you never eat food or drink or come out in the sunlight
and you said no to the beach trip only after you heard where it was
because of the treaty
this last registers with him
she steps closer to him
how old are you
how long have you been seventeen
a long beat as we begin to circle them
he sees he cant hide anymore
honesty is an enormous risk but he has to take it
she knew but its still shocking
we circle i know what the cold ones are
what you are
all sound suddenly drops out
we hear only her whisper
vampire they seem to hover in momentary stasis him utterly exposed her reality utterly rocked
are you afraid
angry then ask me the most basic question what do we eat
you wont hurt me
you think you know me
he glares at her
she holds her ground
suddenly he takes her by the hand
where are we going
up the mountain
out of the cloud bank
you need to see what really am
what i look like in the harsh light of the sun
the sunlight will kill you
you need to see the truth
he pulls her but she stumbles
suddenly hes right next to her
are you afraid
then come with me
someplace where no one can protect you
where could do what ive wanted to do from the first moment i met you
their proximity is intense riveting both of them
im not afraid
you should be
he abruptly and effortlessly scoops her up into his arms
then he flings her onto his back
and starts running
as in the opening sequence edward races through the forest dark trunks strobing past as he picks up speed faster and faster
bella clings to his back as it seems hell collide with the trees but he avoids them with supernatural grace
its frightening nauseating intoxicating
are you afraid
but she clings tighter
they climb in altitude
higher and higher above the fog layer
finally up ahead the forests edge fast approaches a clearing is beyond
the sunlight glows white hot beyond the trees
theyre about to emerge from the shadowy darkness
but suddenly bella finds herself sitting on the ground against a tree
all is silent
shes dizzy tries to regain her equilibrium
then she realizes shes alone
where are you
she rises then steps just beyond the fringe of the ferns into a perfect circle of swaying grass wildflowers and buttery sunlight
hear a stream nearby
bella looks around and finally sees edward his shirt open standing nearby in the shade of some trees
he watches her cautiously
she takes a step toward him but he holds up a hand
finally he takes deep breath and steps out of the shade this is why we dont show ourselves in sunlight
as the sun hits him
edwards skin literally sparkles as if embedded with thousands of tiny diamonds
he is magnificent shimmering like a statue carved from glittering crystal
he moves toward her
this is what i am
he nears clearly expecting her to recoil but
he realizes that shes in awe
she reaches to touch him but he immediately backs into the shadows his skin normal again
im a killer bella
this is the skin of a killer
his arm juts into a shaft of light sparkling again
i dont believe that
because you believe the lie
im the worlds most dangerous predator
everything about me invites you in my voice my face even my smell
as if need any of that
hes suddenly behind her then in front of her then by tree darting so fast we only see where he lands as if you could outrun me
as if you could fight me off
he abruptly rips off a large tree limb then throws it against tree trunk with explosive force
bella flinches but holds her ground unshakable
im designed to kill
i dont care
ive killed people
it doesnt matter
i wanted to kill you
ive never wanted a humans blood so much in my life
im dangerous to you
i trust you
i trust you edward
she takes his hand
he reels at the warmth of her touch
she leans in drawn to him unaware that her throat is nearing his lips
then suddenly hes gone
she looks over to find hes on the other side of the meadow catching his breath
took me by surprise
collecting himself i dont know how to
he moves back toward her
me and my family were different from others of our kind
were not nomadic we have a permanent home
we only hunt animals
weve learned to control our thirst
shaking his head but you your scent its like drug to me
my own personal brand of heroin
i thought you hated me when we met
for making me want you so badly
im still not sure i can control myself
he reaches her again
i know you can
hes utterly vulnerable as he looks at her searching her face for clues
i wish i could understand this thing you see in me
you look at me with those eyes
frustrated i cant read your mind
tell me what youre thinking
stricken he sinks gracefully to his knees in the grass
she sinks down in front of him
not of that
that ill lose you
amazed elated you dont know how long ive looked for you
they share a smile
then he reaches toward her neck pausing
be very still
she does so
exercising great control he places his hand on her throat
its so exposed so vulnerable
the rush between them is overwhelming
but bella doesnt move
he brushes his hand up her cheek
then lowers it to her heart
clouds float past the sun
theyre both overwhelmed taking each other in
and so the lion fell for the lamb
sick masochistic lion
crane up on the two of them laying together as close as they dare
his hand to her heart
close on bellas face
still in bed
about three things i was absolutely positive
one edward was vampire
she rises goes to the mirror
looks at herself worry knitting her brow
two there was a part of him that thirsted for my blood
as she moves past her window something catches her eye causing her to bang into her desk
she looks back out
edward leans against his car looking up at her with a small smile
she beams at the sight of him
i was falling unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him
edward helps bella balance walk across an enormous fallen pine tree in the moss covered forest
how long have you been like this
since nineteen eighteen
thats when carlisle found me
she takes that in its a lot
but it stokes her curiosity
whered he find you
in a hospital dying of spanish influenza
my parents had already died
flashback to chicago hospital night what was it like
the word excruciating comes to mind
but what carlisle did was much harder
not many of us have the restraint to do that
didnt he just
our bite contains venom
and once we taste blood a sort of
its almost impossible to stop
but carlisle did
first with me then with his wife esme
he found her in a hospital as well
the others followed
back to present day does someone have to be dying to become like you
their conversation continues as we go to they walk along a stunning coastline rugged black rocks covered in bright green moss
no thats just carlisle
he would never do
this to someone who had another choice
so carlisles the reason why you hunt animals instead of people
not the only reason
he stops looks down at her serious with emotion
i dont want to be a monster
we call ourselves vegetarians by the way
for our kind hunting animals is like living on tofu
it keeps you strong but isnt very satisfying
then abruptly he whips past bella
she turns to see him standing on a large rock in the river
its not that impressive really
anyone in my family can do this
can they all read minds too
no thats unique to me
but alice can see the future
bet she saw me coming mile away
she notes his change of mood as he slows darkening
her visions are very subjective
the future can change
he cuts off her questions by returning to shore and continuing their walk
water sprays from a hose as bella and edward wash her truck
a boom box plays
he perches on top of the roof
come to my house tomorrow
bella looks up aiming the hose badly water ricochets off the cab and sprays in her face
he jumps down from the roof
with your family
he wipes down the dented front fender then reaches under it and with his bare hands easily pops a large dent out of the trucks body
shes too flustered to register it
what if they dont like me
laughing heartily youre worried not because youll be in a houseful of vampires but because you think they wont approve of you
im glad i amuse you
but then his laughter dies as he hears something
what is it
as a black car comes into view and pulls up
ill pick you up tomorrow
he heads to his car eying the passengers in jacob with his father billy whos expression is intense
slow motion as edward locks eyes with billy
jacob looks questioningly at his father
bella watches edward drive away perturbed by the exchange
she forces a smile and goes to greet the visitors
jacob sets up billys wheelchair and billy climbs into it as come to visit your truck
you got that dent out
actually we came to visit your flat screen
first mariners game of the season
plus jacob here kept bugging me to see you again
mortified great dad
jacob shoots his father an irritated look just as the police cruiser pulls up
charlie climbs out holding two six packs
holds up a brown paper harry clearwaters homemade fish fry
charlie smiles pleased
he clicks on the game as they all head inside any luck with the waylon case
darkening found a footprint out at the crime scene today
a bare human footprint
billy seems disturbed but not surprised
bella is horrified
a person did that
a crazy person walking around barefoot this time of year
spread the word out at the rez will ya
keep the kids out of the woods
directed at bella dont want no one else getting hurt
bella looks away from billy unnerved
bella floats near edward only their hands touching but their bodies are nearing so close so sensual
suddenly edward is yanked downward
something has him pulling him down
as her eyes pop open
and relief sweeps over her as she realizes it was just a dream
but it haunts her
aerial shot of the forest as we sweep over its lush green expanse to find edwards volvo speeding along very fast
the volvo finally turns off the paved highway and onto a long serpentine dirt road
follow the car until finally it reaches a small meadow in the center of which sits a timeless graceful house
the volvo pulls up and bella climbs out surprised
you expected turrets dungeons and moats
he takes her hand
she girds herself
they head inside
edward guides bella into the large bright house
walls of glass look out on the river
everythings open and white
historical objects are tastefully placed throughout
hear verdis la traviata libiamo ne lieti calici coming from another room
bella is enraptured
its so light and open
thanks to tinted windows
its the one place we never have to hide
we then notice clanging coming from the kitchen
edward shakes his head
i told them not to do this
verdis opera blasts bella and edward who enter to find the kitchen in full swing
cullen emmett rosalie and esme prepare elaborate platters of italian pastas and antipasti
esme rolls out a pizza dough and fans tomatoes around it in an instant
rosalie stirs a pot disinterested
esme sees bella and stops emanating maternal warmth
her heart shaped face and billows of hair are reminiscent of the silent movie era
were making italiano for you
this is esme my mother for all intents and purposes
youve given us an excuse to use the kitchen for the first time
pan across brand new williams sonoma cookware boxes to the corner theyre watching an italian cooking show on a tv
emmett hits the dvd remote control
i hope youre hungry
oh absolutely she already ate
bella shoots him a look but something shatters
rosalie has thrown down a bowl and now strides out perfect
bella exits behind rosalie trying to explain
the others follow i just assumed because you dont eat you know
that was very considerate of you
re rosalie ignore her
yes lets keep pretending this isnt dangerous for all of us
i would never ever tell anyone
reassuring she knows that
the problem is you two have gone public now so
no she should know
to bella the entire family will be implicated if this ends badly
this hangs in the air uncomfortably
edward cant look at her
like where i become meal
emmett chokes back laughter
wraps his arm around bella
even esme has to chuckle
rosalie exasperated heads back into the kitchen
emmett shrugs goes after her
on the balcony alice leaps over the rail holding a bouquet of wildflowers
jasper follows her
she bounces forward to kiss bellas cheek and hands bella the wildflowers
you do smell good
its alright bella and i are going to be great friends
extending her hand and youre jasper right
pleasure to meet you
but he shies away from her hand
gently encouraging you wont hurt her jasper
he isnt so sure
edward takes bellas hand instead
ill give you a tour of the house
with meaning ill see you soon
edward shoots alice a look which bella catches before he guides her up the stairs
as they ascend bella takes in the eclectic art pieces from around the world ethiopian crosses dresden china asian scrolls
they reach the landing to find a wall of dozens of artistically arrayed silk squares with tassels
bella looks closer
a private joke
we matriculate a lot
what a nightmare repeating high school
true but the younger we start out in new place the longer we can stay there
she shivers at the thought of it as they continue on
and this is my room
bella enters to find a wall of glass doors open to a deck with the river beyond
the rest is floor to ceiling cds vinyl track tapes etc
with a sophisticated i pod stereo set up
so youre obsessed with music
looking around no bed
no nightmares no drool no snoring
she considers this as she runs a hand along a wall of cds studying the titles
do you have any favorites
ooh she knows her music
id have to say
he looks at her surprised smiles
my favorite too
off their connection he pulls out a cd and puts it on
solo piano version of clair de lune begins to play
he moves to her taking her hand then he starts to turn her in a pirouette dancing with her but she breaks off and backs away
no tripping no falling no derision
mischievously i can always make you
you dont scare me
you really shouldnt have said that
he grins a low growling sounds in the back of his throat
she laughs and backs out the door onto bella backs up to the rail
edward appears in the doorway shifting into a half crouch about to pounce
dont you dare suddenly shes airborne as he tackles her and they fly off the deck
then she finds herself in a tree in his arms
when she realizes where she is she laughs delighted
its infectious he laughs heartily too
esme and dr
cullen look out the window
edwards laughter filters inside to them esme in turn smiles
shes brought him to life
hes been alone too long
but how can it end well
alice has been wrong before
esme turns to dr
cullen gentle but absolutely firm
bella is what he wants
it will work out
cullen smiles at her with love then takes her hand as they look back out the window
edward looks bella in the eye
then close your eyes
she does warily
he grips her more firmly then leaps them to another tree like a flying squirrel
then again to the top of another tree
he easily gets a foothold while holding bella
to the most astonishing birds eye view of the valley river and the mountains beyond
camera whirls around them allowing us a degree view of their surroundings
off bellas intoxicated face
jessica pops a volleyball in the air doing practice serves
angela takes a picture of her then points her camera around looking for another shot
eric studies some fliers advertising the prom
thats our prom theme
gambling tuxedos and ala sean connery bond
as jessica head butts the ball which hits him in the face
angela scanning for a shot has frozen
jessica and eric arriving together
all eyes on campus are turning to them filled with curiosity jealousy envy
not that guy over yeah he just looked
off his rakish but reassuring smile
moving fast tracking
include charlie holding the leash its a hunting party several dogs half a dozen armed men
guys we got something the deputies hurry to charlie
they gather around a footprint
the dogs start pulling them in a certain direction
as the posse takes off at a sprint we watch charlie and the posse move away
reverse to find laurent stands next to him
victoria jogs up
they took the bait
by tomorrow theyll be half way to winnipeg
victoria lasciviously grabs james shirt
pulls him to her
i love when men chase me
he grins then starts taking off her clothes
they pull each other toward the woods with carnal lust
it barely registers with laurent who continues to watch the posse with concern
bella hurries toward the entrance trying to keep the joy on her face in check
with minimal success
outside the door she passes mike hanging out with several of his basketball teammates
you and cullen
she shrugs non committal but cant entirely hide a smile as she hurries inside to charlies table and slides in
sorry im late
cora sets a top sirloin steak in front of charlie and plate of seafood in front of bella
ordered you the seafood combo
order one for yourself next time
you should cut back on the steak
im healthy as a horse
concerned say chief boys want to know you find anything down by queets river today
charlies aware of the loggers at the counter listening too
he frames his answer carefully to keep everyone calm
the suspects moving east
kitsap county sheriff is taking over from here
theyre putting extra guys on
hope they catch him fast
she moves off with a measure of relief
charlie and bella pass each other the salt butter for bread etc
with an easy rhythm now
your friends are flagging you
she turns to see mike and the guys horsing around outside straws in their noses making faces at her
its okay you wanna join them
im just gonna turn in early anyway
yeah me too
its a friday night
the newton boys got a big smile for you
nice family the newtons
hes just a friend
none of the boys in town interest you
were not really going to talk about boys are we
you should be around people
i leave you alone too much
with genuine affection ive never minded being alone
guess im a lot like my dad that way
these two have come a long way
cora returns berry cobbler two forks
she sets it between them
off them both reaching for forks
bella dressed for bed looks out the window as she talks on the phone with rene
bellas euphoria still lingers in her eyes
so spring trainings going well
rene talks on her cell
phil is in the background post batting practice chowing down with a couple of teammates
phils working hard
were looking around for a house to rent in case it becomes permanent
youd like jacksonville baby
actually forks is kind of growing on me
stops knows theres more could
a guy have something to do with that
small smile maybe

trying to avoid lies well
he is kind of a history buff
this as she turns to find edward lying on her bed smiling
she nearly drops the phone
have to go
no way we gotta talk boys
are you being safe
edward shoots her a look he heard that
ill call you later mom
stay on bella who hangs up
how did you get in here
youve been here before
what else is there to do at night
she pushes him
he grabs her hand and playfully pulls her onto the bed wrestling as youre a peeping tom
the chief will hear you
but the electricity of their physical contact quickly overwhelms them their laughter quieting
he studies her face
like watching over you
he raises his fingers to her lips sending a thrill up her spine
theres something id like to try
she nods bedazzled by him
he takes her face in his hands hesitates to test himself then he softly kisses her
what neither of them is prepared for is her response
her breath comes in a wild gasp
her fingers knot in his hair clutching him to her
lips part as she breathes his scent
then his hands gently but forcefully push her face back
she opens her eyes to see that his eyes are wild his jaw clenched
he relaxes slightly looking at her blushing face
im stronger than i thought
wish i could say the same
im so embarrassed
but we have to be careful
serious i can never lose control with you
she nods then carefully lies on his chest
he wraps his arms around her
off the two of them
bella enters to find charlie cleaning a rifle
he starts to say hello but she just blurts out
i have a date with edward cullen
he suddenly looks like hes having an aneurysm
hes too old for you
were both juniors
i thought you liked the cullens
and i thought you werent interested in any of the boys in town
edward doesnt live in town
and its in the early stage and whatever hes outside right now
hes out there
he wants to meet you
he cocks the rifle in mock seriousness
be nice okay
charlie gives his daughter a reassuring nod
then she opens the door to reveal edward in a parka and gloves
i wanted to formally introduce myself
edward extends his hand
charlie takes it but grunts hello resisting him
i wont keep bella out late tonight
were just going to go play baseball with my family
bellas going to play baseball
bellas equally surprised but hides it
yes sir thats the plan
more power to you i guess
looks him in the eyes shell be safe with me sir i promise
as edward exits
charlie holds bella back
sotto you got that pepper spray
edward and bella climb into a massive jeep parked in the drive
amused your father thinks you should go to an all girls school
no fair reading charlies mind
as they climb in the jeep bella notices a baseball bat and since when do vampires like baseball
its the american pastime
plus theres a thunderstorm coming
its the only time we can play
youll see why
storm clouds gather in the sky as bella and edward pull up in the jeep
she takes in a rough baseball diamond set into an enormous field in the lap of the olympic peaks
esme and emmett come to greet bella
good thing youre here
we need umpire
big crooked grin she thinks we cheat
i know you cheat
call em as you see em bella
whip pan to alice on the pitchers mound
just as a deep rumble of thunder shakes the forest
and its extraordinary
bella stays by esme who plays catcher
alice pitches with lightning fast speed
edward and emmett take positions in the outfield
rosalie smashes the ball with the aluminum bat
it cracks like thunder and is followed directly by real thunder
to esme now i get why you need the thunder
the ball shoots like a meteor deep into the forest rocketing through the trees
edward disappears after it
that has to be a home run
edwards very fast
rosalie darts around the bases almost a blur edward races out of the forest with the ball and whips it to home plate
esme catches it a millisecond before rosalie slides in
amazed bella watches as dr
cullen hits a line drive
edward and emmett race for the catch diving feet and colliding with such might that it sounds like enormous boulders falling
they miss the ball dr
cullen is safe
jasper whacks the next pitch deep into the forest
but before edward can chase it alice suddenly gasps
i didnt see them
they all stop
edward is immediately at bellas side
the family instantly gathers at home plate
theyre traveling so quickly
you said they left the county they did but then they heard us
looking at edward and changed their minds
to bella put your hair down like thatll help
i could smell her from across the field
edward ignores rosalie as he arranges bellas hair
i shouldnt have brought you here
im so sorry
shed ask why but suddenly they all turn as one toward theres a faint rustle
then james victoria and laurent emerge
as they near bella sees their bare feet then the deep burgundy of their eyes
laurent holds up the baseball
i believe this belongs to you
he tosses the ball his casual toss is still blindingly fast to dr
cullen who easily catches it and smiles politely
could you use three more players
this is victoria
would you like to bat first
laurent picks up a bat
the cullens take the field
cullen is catcher edward is on first with bella behind him near the jeep
bella sees that edwards eyes are locked onto james
laurent is at bat first
im afraid your hunting activities have caused something of a mess for us
we didnt realize the territory had been claimed
yes we maintain a permanent residence
the three newcomers exchange a look of surprise
well we wont be a problem any more
the humans were tracking us but we led them east jasper pitches the ball laurent slams it but alice is up a tree is a flash and the ball slams
into alices hand with a thwap
laurent is pissed but james smiles ever so slightly delighted at the discovery of worthy opponents
james is up next and he power slams it with amazing force
he runs past first past edward past bella
close on bella in slow motion as the wind from the ball ruffles her hair carrying her scent which floats to james who suddenly screeches to a halt
his head whips around at her and he lurches into a crouch his nostrils flaring excitedly eyes locked on bella
you brought a snack
edward springs in front of bella baring his teeth
a truly menacing feral snarl rips from his throat
james growls back
overhead shot in a flash the cullens rush into position behind edward laurent and victoria line up behind james
the girl is with us
trying to defuse situation we wont harm her
hungry for battle just try it
i think it best if you leave
yes i can see the game is over
well go now
but james eyes dont leave edwards
laurent puts a hand on james shoulder and finally james backs into the woods with his cohorts disappearing
once theyre gone esme immediately gathers up the bats get bella out of here
well follow them
cullen jasper and a resentful rosalie race off after the three vampires
edward scoops bella up as we edward whips bella into the jeep and straps her in james is a tracker
i saw his mind
the hunt is his obsession and my reaction set him off the tires spin as edward whips the jeep around were a large clan of strong fighters all protecting one
dark with disgust i just made this his most exciting game ever
bella blanches with the dawning realization of what she has just wrought up on them all as
a jolting death defying ride splashing through creeks until they reach
the jeep speeds wildly down the road
the first place hell go is your house
hell track your scent there
hes in danger because of me
because of us
calmly then well lead the tracker away from him
he angrily whips around a bend mud flying charlie watches a baseball game on t
as the door suddenly bursts open to reveal bella crying and edward devastated i said leave me alone
bella dont do this
just think about it please get out
she slams the door
charlie has risen baffled concerned
i have to get out of this place
out of forks
bella runs upstairs
charlie hurries after her bella slams the door behind her
reveal edwards already there pulling things from her drawers and shoving them into a duffle faster than humanly possible
bella leans against the door
a pained whisper i cant hurt him
edward gives her a look you have to
theres a knock
intercut charlie on the other side
its agony for both of them
did he hurt you
did he break up with you
i broke up with him
i thought you liked him
thats why i have to leave
i dont want this
i want to go home
whispering ill be in the truck
and he disappears out the window
bella gathers strength to continue her performance
she opens the door to reveal charlie
he follows as she carries her duffle and truck keys into bella charges down the stairs charlie follows
your mothers not even in phoenix
shell come home
ill call her from the road
you cant drive home now
ill take you to the airport in the morning
i want to drive
i need time to think
ill pull into a motel in few hours
she heads down the stairs
bella reaches the ground floor with charlie on her heels
shes almost to the door but charlie blocks her
bells i know im not around much but i can change that
we can do more things together
she takes a breath hating herself for what shes about to say
like watch more baseball on the flat screen
or go to the coffee shop
same people same steak same berry cobbler every night
thats you dad
this hits charlie hard
she can barely stand it heads down the stairs as he takes a second to recover
i just got you back
which breaks bellas heart
and forces her to deliver the final blow
and if i dont get out now im going get stuck here like mom did
charlie is stunned wounded
she takes advantage of his shock pushing past him out the door
bella exits heads to her truck
fresh tears spring to her eyes
and a pair of deadly eyes
he watches from a distance as bella pulls out
the truck moves off
and so does james leaving charlie alone with his pain staring out the window
bella drives wiping tears away
suddenly edward is outside the car near bellas window
hell forgive you
off bellas startled look slide over
bella slides over to the passenger side as edward opens the door sliding in and takes the wheel
i said the same words my mother used when she left him
it was the only way hed let you go
edward floors it
your fathers safe now bella
the tracker is following us suddenly boom
a dark figure leaps onto the bed of the truck
its just emmett
alice is in the car behind us
she catches her breath
it kills him to see her so frightened
she looks out the window as they drive through town
the small insulated town passes by in slow motion
inside we see mike jessica eric and angela laughing flirting innocent hopeful
edward emmett and alice rush bella from the truck to the house
but freeze when the door opens and laurent exits
they immediately take defensive positions but dr
he came to warn us
they back down slightly
laurent address dr
ive grown tired of his games
but hes got unparalleled senses
ive never seen anything like him in three hundred years
and the woman victoria will back him
dont underestimate her
cullen nods thanks
laurent looks at edward apologetic
im truly sorry for whats been unleashed here
and he moves off disappearing into the woods
the side door bursts open as edward and the cullens enter followed by bella
the lights flip on to reveal a pristine garage the volvo the red bmw a black mercedes sedan an suv
everyone but rosalie springs into action opening cupboards for supplies cell phones extra batteries maps portable gps units changes of clothes cans of gasoline etc
as they load up the vehicles ive had to fight our kind before
were hard to kill
but not impossible
well tear him up with bloodlust well rip him apart with our hands then burn the pieces i dont relish killing another creature
even a sadistic one like james
if he doesnt get to one of us first
horrified this is insane
you cant put yourselves in danger like this for me
edward shoots rosalie a look but he grabs two sets of keys off a hook throwing one set lightning fast to dr
cullen ill run bella south while you lead the tracker away
no edward the tracker thinks you wont leave bella
hell follow you
ill go with bella
jasper and will drive her south
facing him ill keep her safe edward
alice steps forward
studies her torn can you keep your thoughts to yourself
an unspoken agreement
edward finally surrenders his keys to alice
then he opens one of bellas suitcases pulling out clothes tossing them to esme rosalie put these on so the tracker will pick up bellas scent
dropping the clothes why should i
what is she to me
just a danger youve inflicted on us spinning on her rosalie
bella is with edward
shes a part of this family now
and we protect our family
she glowers but picks up the clothes
cullen hits the door opener and the massive metal doors roll open
cullen squeezes edwards shoulder before he and esme climb into the suv
everyone finishes loading up climbing in cars amid this edward and bella take a moment together
if any of you get hurt because of me we wont there are five of us two of them
when its done ill come get you
he pulls her closer looking into her eyes
youre my life now
they drink each other in possibly for the last time
as the suv peels out wiping the frame the sun begins to rise on the empty road as a sleek black mercedes sedan with dark tinted windows blasts through frame
jasper drives alice in the passenger seat
bella is in the back her eyes red from crying
she talks on her cell phone mom its me again
you must have let your phone die
anyway im not in forks anymore but im okay
ill explain when you call
she hangs up then faces back out the window watching the green misty olympic peninsula speed past
off bellas face show us the landscape as it changes from dark green forests to stretches of grassy hillsides to drier browner surroundings until night falls and headlights lights flash
finally we land in
trees blow past us at a blinding speed as we track edward rosalie and emmett who dart in and out of frame blasting through the misty woods edward the fastest
in the lead
edward stops trying to read his enemys thoughts
rosalie tears a tiny swatch of her shirt leaves it on a flowering maple tree
and then theyre gone
esme and dr
cullen crouch atop a hill looking down at the river
in the distance below they see their pov on the lake victoria jogs into view
she then looks in their direction
cullen and esme are assured she has their scent they continue over the hills crest
james blasts past the flowering maple then stops backtracks to the tree finds the tiny swatch of fabric
he starts off again
but stops smells the fabric
somethings not right
he runs back in the opposite direction
on bellas face her eyes pop open
shes lying atop a bed fully clothed
she rises reorienting
the blinds are pulled
alice and jasper stare blankly at t
several plates of food crowd a table
alice looks up as bella enters looking at her cell phone
i wish hed call
you should eat
but bella ignores the food
she sits heavily
they could get hurt
its not worth it
shes taken aback
its the first time hes engaged with her
edwards changed since he found you
and none of us want to look into his eyes for the next hundred years if he loses you
he looks forward again its worth it
suddenly alice reels
jasper goes to her bella follows
what do you see
with deep worry the tracker
he just changed course
jasper quickly sets a pad of paper and pencil in front of her
where will it take him alice
push in on alices face as we a disorienting vision of him standing in a room full of
its a room of mirrors
alice begins to draw at hyper speed closing her eyes trying to see it clearly
how do the visions work
edward said they werent always certain
she sees the course people are on while theyre on it
if they change their minds the visions change
bella looks over alices shoulder to see the drawing
so the course james is on now will lead him to
a ballet studio
looks up at her youve been here
i dont know
i used to take ballet lessons as a kid
the school had an arch like that
was your school here in phoenix
yeah around the corner from my house
but i havent been there in ten years
do you have any reason to go now
i hated the place
alice and jasper share a look trying to figure this out
suddenly bella jumps as her cell phone rings
she picks it up
sees the caller i
and exhales relief
are you alright
cullen drives the jeep fast emmett in the back edward in the passenger seat on his cell phone
im coming to get you
hates having to say this we lost the tracker
the woman is still in the area
rosalie and esme are protecting your father
sinking this is my fault
you warned me but i didnt think
bella were in too deep
we cant change how we feel
then when will you get here
in a couple hours
then you and will go somewhere
the others will keep hunting
then determined bella i swear to you ill do whatever it takes to make you safe again
off bella her eyes welling
see alice in the lobby settling the bill
jasper loads up the car out front
bella gathers her things then her phone rings again
insert caller i
it reads home
bella answers mom im so glad you got my
where are you
calm down mom
everything is fine okay
ill explain every hear rustling on the line as if rene dropped the phone
are you there
then bella hears a voice that sends a chill down her spine nice house you have here
not the best on the block but comfortable
very close on james his sinister eyes and vicious smile
i was prepared to wait for you
but then mom came home after she received a very worried call from your dad
it all worked out quite well
bellas eyes are wild with fear
i must say forks high school doesnt protect its students privacy very well
it was just too easy for victoria to find your previous address
leave my mother out of this
youre protective of her
you can still save her
but youll need to get away from your friends
can you do that
dont think so
if your mothers life depends on it
bella is terrified but theres no choice here
where should i meet you
james grins as he fingers a photo of bella thats attached to the refrigerator with a magnet
its the same photo charlie has of her age in a tutu sitting on the floor
the old ballet studio around the corner
and ill know if you bring anyone along
poor mommy would pay the price for that mistake
sniffs the air she smells like you
stay on bella as she hangs up panicked
she starts flinging open drawers searching for a weapon a pen a sewing kit
then she remembers
she dumps out the contents and finds the pepper spray charlie gave her
she clings to it her only protection now
bella walks through the lobby scanning for jasper and alice
she spots them outside under the porte cacher loading the mercedes deep in a heated discussion
she slips out the opposite door rushes toward a taxi and jumps in closes the door
the driver is an elderly woman with a hacking cough
taking a breath for courage th and palo verde please
the taxi pulls out
bella watches the hotel disappear
off her face in the rear window
ive never given much thought to how i would die
once again we see the polished malls the manicured cactus gardens
all empty for the night
but dying in the place of someone love seems like a good way to go
bella climbs out of the taxi
it pulls away leaving her on the curb facing the deserted building
bella twirls her mothers ring around her finger then reaches for the pepper spray
i cant bring myself to regret the decisions that brought me face to face with death
they also brought me to edward
she slips the pepper spray into her jeans pocket
she wraps her purse strap around her wrist
she takes a breath approaches the school
peers in the windows
the blinds are drawn
but from inside we hear a faint sound
bella goes to the front door
bella cautiously enters this grand empty room of mirrors
ballet bar wraps around the walls bella where are you
bella whirls trying to find its source
she follows the sound to a cleaning supply closet
she throws open the door to find a t
on screen a video plays bella age hides in the very closet the t
is in now
little bella looks up at us
dont you want to dance baby
little bella shakes her head stubbornly
the frame jiggles as rene hands someone the camera
rene ten years younger appears on screen and kneels next to bella
everyone makes fun of me
but youre a wonderful dancer
mom i suck
laughter behind bella
she spins trying to locate james in the mirrors
thats my favorite part
stubborn child werent you
bellas face flushes with rage
shes not here
but you really made it too easy
visible in the mirror he sighs disappointed
then he steps up next to her and points a video camera at bella
so to make things more entertaining im going to make a little film of our time together
borrowed this from your house
hope you dont mind
turns it on and
bella flings her purse at him and runs for the door
an escape attempt
suddenly hes right behind her
itll break edwards little heart
he smells her hair
touches her throat
edward has nothing to do with this
his rage will make for more interesting sport than his feeble attempt to protect you
hes having too much fun to notice the peppers spray in her hand
she spins around and sprays him
then she runs as james reels back briefly
but he leaps over her and lands right in front of her
amused he flings her across the floor like a bowling ball
she smashes hard into a mirrored column
james captures it on film
very visually dynamic
i chose my stage well
he advances toward her
still stubborn arent you
is that what makes you special
because frankly i dont see it
he inhales as if he can taste her already too bad he didnt have the strength to turn you
instead he kept you this fragile little human
its cruel really
james flips on the camera but the lens is coated with pepper spray
he tries to wipe it off
youve succeeded in annoying me
he stomps on her shin
hear her tibia snap
bella screams in agony
tell edward how much it hurts
abruptly the camera is in her face tell him to avenge you
james inhales as her blood pools
he leans in hungry
bella half conscious watches him turn the camera on his own face cut
suddenly james is knocked out of frame
he rises to find himself face to face with edward
james charges edward forcing him up against a column
because youre faster than the others
but not stronger
james smashes edwards face into the mirror until it cracks
im strong enough to kill you
edward flings james backwards smashing through freestanding mirror into the doorway
he scoops bella up and leaps toward the balcony exit door when suddenly he and bella are jerked downward
james yanks edward violently onto the floor knocking bella out of his arms as james flings edward up into the top window embedding him in the casement and bricks
james crouches beside bella
he grabs her hand looking directly at edward with a sinister grin he sinks his teeth into bellas hand
she screams in agony
edwards rage erupts he climbs out of the window casement and suicide dive bombs james savagely plowing him through the floorboards
on bella as the venom travels through her veins
bellas pov dark figures twist and fight in and out of focus
her eyes suddenly pop open to see the explosive raw reality of james kicking edward delivering death blows when suddenly edwards hand shoots up and grabs james ankle
edward roars up to his feet and swings james around like baseball bat smashing him into mirror after mirror
james is battered beaten
bella moans and the sound of her pain slices through edward
in an animalistic fury edward bites off a piece of james flesh
whip pan from bellas horrified face to dr
cullen now standing beside edward placing a hand on his sons shoulder
edward turns to see his father and emmett jasper and alice dropping down from the balcony
edwards expression changes he realizes hes gone too far
he backs off as his siblings crouch into attack mode and lunge at james like a pack of animals
cullen rushes to the injured bella who screams again in pain
edward dashes toward her bellas pov on the three cullen siblings going in and out of focus
it almost looks like a tribal dance as they rip out the floorboards and build a fire
its like a funeral pyre as they rip james apart throwing limbs into the fire
back on bella as edward reaches her side
cullen works fast to assess her wounds focusing on a massive bleed from her leg
but clearly her hand hurts the most
she writhes in pain
cullen applies pressure to the gash on her thigh her femoral arterys been severed
shes losing too much blood its on fire
venom working on bella you have to make a choice
either let the change happen no
bellas pov alice appears behind edward fuzzy indistinct
its going to happen
ive seen it it doesnt have to be that way
alice find me a tourniquet
rag a shirt
alice holds her nose and avoids the blood as she rips the sleeve off her blouse and kneels to aid dr
whats the other choice
you said to alice tighter above the knee carlisle
you can try to suck the venom out
i wont be able to stop find the will to stop
but choose she only has minutes left
edward looks down at bella thrashing in pain
finally edward takes her hand
she tries to pull it away
its alright bella
ill make it go away
he looks at her then starts to suck the venom from her hand
they never take their eyes off one another the connection palpable intense
close on bellas eyes wild with pain
close on edwards eyes the frenzy has begun
he sucks harder
anguished he wants to stop but cant
cullens voice sounds miles away
her blood is clean youre killing her
but the bloodlust is too strong
he is killing her
bella looks at him forgivingly as she begins to lose consciousness
bellas pov on edward growing blurry
he disappears into the blinding light
its as if shes underwater like her dreams
death is peaceful
bella starts to float away
were losing her
suddenly from the darkness edward reaches out a hand
a brilliant light flares
but they slowly open
she squints at the light
an oxygen tube rests under her nose
she reaches for it confused
a hand stops her as her surroundings come into focus
youre awake baby
bella lies in a hospital bed
bandaged leg in a cast
in bad shape
rene hovers over her tears in her eyes
on the dresser see get well cards and a photo montage of her friends from forks
wheres hes asleep
she nods across the room to a chair in which edward sleeps
he never leaves
and your dads down in the cafeteria
baby you fell down two flights of stairs and through a window
bella is drawing a blank confused
rene jogs her memory edward came here to convince you to come back to forks
his father brought him down
you went to their hotel but you tripped on the stairs
then bella realizes its a cover story
sounds like me
renes cell phone beeps
she opens it
reads a text starts typing in a reply
hes worried about you
smiling i told him to stay in florida
the suns signed him
thats great mom
jacksonville is always sunny and youll have your own bathroom
i want to live in forks
i have dad
re the get well cards and friends
re edward and hes there
bella shrugs conceding the truth
charlie doesnt like him
blames him for your leaving
what do you think
lowering her voice i think that boy is in love with you
bella glances at edward
um mom would you mind getting dad
want to talk to him
im sure he doesnt care about that baby
but ill go get him
rene kisses bellas forehead
bella watches her go
the door shutting behind her
bella turns back to find edward standing next to her with deep concern
her eyes well
he kisses her forehead soothingly
is james did you we took care of him
and the woman victoria she ran off
she closes her eyes with relief then looks at him
im alive because of you
darkens youre in here because of me
her wounds cause him pain
he strokes her face
the worst of it
was thinking couldnt stop but you did
bella you should go to jacksonville
where i cant hurt you anymore
i want to be with you
dont want sitting next to her sssh
im not going anywhere
im right here
he wraps an arm around her
as she curls up in his arms
an aerial sweep over the lush green forests
were back in the misty damp beauty of the pacific northwest
at a picnic table charlie cleans a fish with a big knife
edward waits awkwardly near his volvo dressed in an elegant suit
but even calm edward is unnerved by charlies glare
the front door opens and they look up to see bella framed in the doorway in a stunning long dress
edward is enchanted
bella descends the steps with difficulty due to her leg cast
charlie edges out edward to help her down
alice lent me the dress
it was the only thing that would fit over my cast
is it too
ill take good care of her chief
heard that before
edward moves to open the car door
charlie holds bella back
sotto i put new pepper spray in your bag
you look beautiful
father and daughter share a smile
edwards volvo pulls up to this lovely inn
he helps bella out of the car and begins to guide her through the dining room
molina and other teachers are there
we may notice the back of a redhead mingling with the chaperones
i cant believe youre making me do this
he just grins
edward guides her around a corner to
the prom monte carlo style
gaming tables and roulette wheels
guys in tuxes and girls in gowns gamble for prizes dance and socialize
you really are trying to kill me
prom is an important rite of passage
i dont want you to miss anything
she cant be mad at him just shakes her head affectionately
they continue into the prom
several heads turn
bella sees the dance floor where a gap has formed
in the middle two couples whirl gracefully
its alice and jasper rosalie and emmett looking absolutely stunning
rosalie glances over indifference has replaced fury
but alice waves brightly
bella returns it with a smile as we hear a crossfade into the next track its eric at the turntables making the room bounce
next to him angela wears the headphones flipping through a stack of vinyl
they nod at bella she shoots them a smile when a flashbulb gets her attention mike and jessica stand in front of an aston martin cut out
bella catches their eye mike does his best james bond impersonation
jessica poses like pussy galore
edward smirks then turns to bella shall we
laughs then realizes youre serious
he doesnt wait for an answer more or less carries her to the dance floor then places her feet atop his own
and starts to move
she actually begins to enjoy it
as they dance she feels his grace his strength
finally she looks at him
why did you save me
off his questioning look if youd let the venom spread i couldve been like you by now
stops horrified you dont know what youre saying
you dont want this
i want you
angry i wont end your life for you
he keeps dancing slowly hoping his was the last word
im dying anyway
every minute i get closer older thats how its supposed to happen
not the way alice saw it
off his sharp look i heard her
she saw me like you
her visions change bella
based on what someone decides
and ive decided
he looks at her angry
is that what you dream about
becoming a monster
i dream about being with you forever
you really want this
he lowers his lips to her neck
one bite is all it would take
youre ready right now
his lips hover over her skin a long beat
then he presses his lips to her throat
not a bite
he looks at her
youre going to have a long and happy life with me
isnt that enough
she looks at him
and finally smiles
they whirl around gliding on his grace never looking away from one another as we crane up on them in each others arms
no one will surrender tonight
but i wont give in
i know what i want
continue up and back on the dance floor
someones watching it looking down from the window of a second floor hotel room in the inn
the music wafting up in echoes
pull back to reveal
victoria turning from the window
shes stylishly dressed now but seething a low sinister snarl in the back of her throat
