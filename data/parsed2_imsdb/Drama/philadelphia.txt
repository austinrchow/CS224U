philadelphia by ron nyswaner by ron nyswaner september which may include the liberty bell the italian market scenes along the delaware and schuylkill rivers independence square the russian orthodox neighborhood
the ghettos of north philly
main titles play over this sequence which culminates in a title philadelphia city hall
pour into city hall into
young lawyer jamey collins darts through the crowd carrying an accordion file under his arm like a football
jamey elbows his way through a japanese tour group
jamey trots up a marble staircase two steps at a time making a racket
jamey rushes toward a door marked judge tate
raised voices from inside judge tates chambers this construction site is causing mortal and irreparable harm to an unsuspecting public
my client has one of the finest and most respected safety records in the business your honor
jamey shoves open the door revealing two lawyers backs to in conservative gray and joseph miller in pinstripes
one at a time
your honor since rockwell corp
began construction the surrounding residential neighborhood has been enshrouded in a cloud of foul smelling germ carrying pestilent dust
my client is being forced to breathe known carcinogens daily
other residents are coming forth on a daily basis to add their voices of outrage
your honor i submit there were no complaints until counselor began knocking on doors drumming up business
and the dust which counselor refers to has appeared on only three occasions
each time it has been examined and the results
behind his back andrew wiggles his fingers
jamey stuffs a document into andrews hand
messy but innocuous
andrew submits the report to the judge
defined by websters as harmless
i know what it means
your honor imagine how the children in this neighborhood have been made to feel
the pounding of construction ringing in their ears as this skyscraper a tribute to mankinds greed grows daily casting an ominous shadow over their lives filling them with dread even
as they are surrounded in a black toxic fog blocking out the sun while poisoning their lungs
and counselor calls it harmless
his back turned momentarily to the judge andrew mouths to jamey not bad
but he whips around serious again your honor counselor is attempting to portray my client as a hideous manifestation of evil and corruption
but nothing could be further from the truth
rockwell has generously contributed ten thousand dollars to this neighborhoods schools clinics and youth centers
granting a restraining order on the construction site will throw hundreds of philadelphians out of work and will lend validation to this contemptible and groundless nuisance suit which speaks directly
to the kind of greed and treachery that today is threatening the very fabric of our society
judge tate looks skeptically at both lawyers
lets not go off the deep end gentlemen
i thought we were talking about some dust
joined by andrew and joe crowding inside int
as soon as the doors close andrew whips out a micro cassette recorder making notes and joe in the opposite corner of the elevator does exactly the same thing plaintiff
seeks to re
whereas decedent had strain defendants from con pre existing asthmatic tinued improper use of trade condition and ride on name without
ultra loop caused sub sequent death
andrew and joe stop at the same time look at each other
and turn toward the corner seeking privacy
plaintiffs permission or
complainant seeks authorization
theres a persistent beeping andrew and joe pull out their portable telephones at the same time they look at each other which phone is ringing
andrew resumes his telephone conversation
into phone miller
the elevator opens andrew breezes past the man on crutches saying to joe client of yours
andrew hurries down the corridor
joe waits a moment
then pursues the man on crutches
andrew ekerges from city hall onto dilworth plaza bustling with darts into the street hailing a cab
andrew hopping out stuffing papers into his briefcase rushing to the door marked dr
roberta gillman internal medicine
coming out is a young asian man with a cotton ball taped to the inside of his elbow
mostly young men in a cheerful room
some like a ups delivery man are attached to ivs some sit with arms extended waiting to be hooked to an iv by tyrone a black camera finds andrew sitting
quietly with an iv drip running into his arm
andrew is wearing a walkman the source of the classical music and hes reading a legal brief
most of the people in the room look sicker than andrew
dialogue can be heard under the classical music although music dominates the soundtrack
slapping a thin patients wrist gonna have to start looking for veins in your feet sweetheart
roberta gillman passes through speaking to andrew andy
can you stop at my office on your way out
andrew is distracted by a hispanic man across the room rolling up his sleeve for an iv his bare arms hands face and neck are marked with purple blotches
andrew closes his eyes concentrating for a moment on the classical music
then goes back to work
skyscraper in downtown philly at the end of the work day andrew pushes through glass doors into the plush wheeler building pressing through the tide of workers headed home
clerk in suit and tie to the elevators at the sedate expensively appointed offices of wyant wheeler hellerman tetlow and brown int
up to tax on fourteen and get right back i need you
andrew blasts out of the elevator flashing anthea a four star smile
they stride down the corridor together
just the dazzling paralegal i wanted to see
friendly i know what that means and the answer is no
i have a class tonight

and since youve asked
they pass a silver haired partner kenneth killcoyne

andrew reaches the secretaries station
a cheerful secretary shelby shoves documents at him
conference calls up
they just started the roll call

andrew passes a colleague on her way out rachel smilow rach
im late i have to pick up amy from her afterschool but i want to talk to you about that hansen thing

and tell amy i love her painting its on my wall
andrew sails toward his office
dropping the documents on his desk scanning them
admiring a childs painting taped to the wall
punching into the speaker phone on his desk
the karen hargreave representing lloyd management corporation
the andrew the operator and hargreave a sharp california lawyer
as the operator continues the roll call the and hargreave is replaced by a series of lawyers in offices around the country mostly white males saying present while in andrews
section of the screen
andrew dials a number on another telephone line andrew beckett representing saunders international
andrew punches into the conference call present
the is now joined by sarah beckett a suburban ish american mom in her backyard garden answering a portable phone
the lawyers are into the conference in their portions of the screen their voices heard underneath andrews conversation with his mother
this is a nice surprise
how are you hon
hold on mom
punching into the conference call theres no way my client will go along with that
im sorry i interrupted
he punches out of the conference back to his mom glancing over his shoulder to make sure the door is shut
gillman says im fine
my blood work is excellent
t cells are up
just a sec
conference call yes i think that would alleviate most of our concerns
back to mom my platelets look good too

i hate when you put me on hold
one thirty a
andrews fingers fly across the keys of a notebook computer
needing a reference he shoves his rolling chair away from the computer
opens a reference book
grabs a carton of chinese food
note the library may be equipped with a computer terminal which andrew uses for reference rather than a book
andrew eats sauteed string beans with chopsticks finding a relevant citation ah hah
chewing a string bean rentworth v
court of appeals affirms jury award of punitive damages for wrongful interference with prospective economic relations
a shadow falls across andrew
he ignores it
angle two men in silhouette
walter kenton says look at this fucking guy
hes an animal
andrews hands do not leave the keyboard
the second man steps forward a silhouette becoming visible this is bob seidman
he and kenton wear tuxedos
are we interrupting andy
in a word bob
charles is right behind me
another silhouetted figure appears
this image has a horror film feeling to it
andrew whips around to face them
i was just about to take a break
good evening charles
charles wheeler also in tuxedo remains in shadow
could you step into my office for a sec
deadpan i feel like firing someone tonight
andrew throws an arm over seidmans shoulder
were gonna miss you around here bob
man waiting for clearance from a security guard on andrews dim and quiet floor watches as
seidman kenton and andrew follow charles wheeler up a wide carpeted staircase
wheeler finishes a story and everyone andys expressed a keen interest in the kronos inc
is that correct andy
the lawyers have gathered in wheelers spacious office with its floor to ceiling view of the philadelphia skyline
the fate of the participants interests me yes sir
wheeler kenton and seidman proceed with the male ritual of preparing cigars to be smoked snipping the ends with a brass clip rolling them over their tongues to wet them
sliding the cigars in and out of their rounded mouths
andrew holding a cigar but not preparing to light it watches with a not completely concealed twinkle in his eye
wheeler leans back in his chair swirling a brandy snifter
he exhales cigar smoke with a great deal of pleasure
its good to be king hey charles
kings are out of fashion
id rather be thought of as a benevolent tyrant
prompting andrew its an anti trust action
it is and it isnt charles
macrosystems new software copies all the best known elements of kronos spreadsheet program
if theyre allowed to sell it kronos will get undersold right out of business
for me the legal principle involved is copyright infringement
bearing in mind that bill wright the chairman of macrosystems is a close personal friend of mine
which side of this mess would you desire to be on andy
and dont allow my very tight personal relationship with bill to influence your answer in any way
andrew knows this is a test
and he loves it
sorry charles but
andrew is distracted by a light falling across his face
id like to see kronos win
walter kenton has shifted a lamp so that its light falls a faint purple blotch about the size of a quarter much like the blotches we saw on the hispanic
patient in andrews doctors office
because they deserve to walter
andrew lifts his hand finding that his hair has been pushed back revealing the blotch
he stands nonchalantly running a hand through his hair to cover the blotch
if macrosystems wins an energetic young company will be destroyed five thousand americans will be out of work
moreover the laws of copyright and anti trust were enacted to prevent exactly the kind of bullshit macrosystems is trying to pull
andy do you know who reps kronos inc
get with the program andy
as of this evening about this evening right after the soup course
kronos incorporated is represented by wyant wheeler hellerman tetlow and brown
or more specifically senior associate andrew beckett
a moment before it sinks in then andrew clenches his fist in a victory salute
youll have to get right on it andy were up against the statute of limitations
an associate lawyer in shirtsleeves taps on the office door
tokyo on four bob
excuse me fellas
picking up a phone speaking japanese connichiwa
itsumo osewa ni nari mashita
andrew offers his hand to walter kenton
whats that on your forehead pal
whacked with a racquetball
taking wheelers hand i appreciate your faith in my abilities
faith andy is the belief in something for which we have no evidence
it doesnt apply to this situation
slapping his shoulder go home
i mean get back to work
andrew and wheeler are eye to eye an intimate moment
warmly softly thanks charles
with a fathers affection no sweat buddy
smiling andrew exits the office
away from wheelers office int
doing a joyful end zone dance running in place the way football players do when then score a touch down saying yes
to himself soundlessly
the sound of clanging metal interrupts andrew helena a maintenance worker is emptying a trash can
shes seen his little dance and starts to laugh
smiling andrew puts the unlit cigar into his mouth winks at helena and says in a funny kind of medieval way its good to be king
ten days later
andrews loft int
day its a mirror image
the blotches vary from the size of a dime to the size of a half dollar
he looks awful
a young black womans finger applies makeup to andrews face trying to cover the blotches
this is his friend you want to apply the foundation as evenly as you can andy
you dont want to look like youve thrown it on with a spoon
camera pulls back revealing andrew sitting at a table in his loft a towel around his neck protecting his shirt from makeup
chandra applies the makeup gently supervised by another friend named alan
andrews loft has been turned into a lawyers command post stacks of books documents etc
a third friend bruno sits in the corner flipping through channels on the tv
andrew tries applying makeup to his face
dont you think this colors a little
orange for me
tahitian bronze works best on lesions
think of it as the i just back from aruba look
in the background andrews fax machine receives a fax in andrews work area desk personal computer etc
i got it
bruno removes the fax from the machine walking it over to andrew handing andrew the fax while munching an apple
giving the fax a quick scan thanks bruno
to alan and chandra ive been out of the office four days
i dont want them to think ive been to the beach
searching for something okay
check this out
andrew puts on a pair of big glasses with tortoise shell frames meant to help conceal the blotches
hides everything right
what do you think
you know who you look like andy
that actor in that movie
not the one where he was autistic the one where he dressed up like a lady on a soap opera
you want to try light egyptian
suddenly andrew winces gripping his gut
clearly in pain excuse me a sec
andrew starts out of the room suddenly having to run
just like my cousin fredo
camera holds on chandra alan and bruno
sound of bathroom door slamming shut
bruno saunters across the room and knocks on the bathroom door
you okay andy
andrew rests his head against the wall sweat covering his face
a storm of fire has passed through him and hes hoping its over for now
i think i need to go to the hospital
traffic as he crosses eleventh street toward jefferson hospital ext
he hustles up the ramp toward the emergency entrance
emergency room int
day finding andrew sitting on a gurney holding a cotton ball against his arm where blood has been drawn wearing a blanket over his shoulders fighting chills
chandra and bruno are waiting with andrew
they exchange quick hugs with miguel and andrew ad libbing greetings and goodbyes
thanks you guys
miguel puts his arms around andrew
gillmans out of her office today
told her to take a day off and she did can you believe it
did you get someone to cover your class
miguel touches andrews face checking for fever
dont worry about it
they took blood
andrew holds an empty specimen cup
arent you giving an exam
i said dont worry about it
miguel places a gentle kiss on andrews sweaty forehead
you got a fever baby
suddenly the facade cracks and tears sting andrews eyes
i almost didnt make it to the bathroom miguel
i almost lost control right in front of everybody
holding him so what
its nothing to be ashamed of
you have nothing to be ashamed of okay
andrew pulls himself together brushing aside tears in control of his emotions once more
wait heres my guy
andrew catches the attention of a harried intern whose surgeons greens are covered with blood
beckett im sorry
about my blood work
miguel opens a small notebook making notes
meanwhile id like to prepare you for a colonoscopy so we can take a look inside
why do you need to do this
who are you
who are you
this is my partner
we keep records of hospital visits
to andrew its not a pleasant procedure but if the ks is causing the diarrhea we ought to know right away
it could be parasites an infection
a reaction to azt
thats possible but
hes not going through some painful procedure until weve cancelled out everything else
im trying to help your partner
youre not a member of his immediate family i could have you removed from the er
to the intern hes upset hes sorry
dont apologize for me
hes not sorry okay fine
the diplomat why dont we see what we find out from the blood work

maybe by then well hear from my doctor and well go from there
ill get on the lab about the blood work
to the intern im sorry
the intern walks away
andrews beeper beeps
thats the third time
i better call the office
smiling at niguel would you relax please
i am relaxed
andrew hobbles toward a pay phone outside a visitor lounge where weary relatives are watching tv
andrew drops a quarter into the phone
if you or someone you know
andrews pov on television joe miller on the screen with the words negligence
and in the background photos of maimed burned injured clients
has been injured through the fault of others you may be entitled to legal remedy
then his call is answered shelby
jameys been beeping me i
okay okay calm down
put jamey on
int day grabs the phone when andrews intercom buzzes
this is a disaster
we cant find your revisions on the kronos complaint
slow down jamey for christs sake
i went down to word processing to pick up the corrected copy but they said you havent delivered the corrections
i told them youve been working on it at home and
andrew forgets his physical pain this is more important
i brought it in last night around midnight
its in my computer
what did you file it under
jamey puts his hands on andrews computer keyboard
k r o one
jamey types the file name
jamey i dont have to mention do i that were up against a statute of limitations on this complaint which runs out in
checks his watch seventy five minutes
jamey stares dumbfounded at the computer monitor
its not here andy
andrew closes his eyes
he cant believe this
you go down to word processing and tell those motherfuckers they better come up with that complaint now
or they are fucking dead you tell them that comes from me
andrew slams the phone into its cradle
he pauses takes a deep breath and says to himself every problem has a solution
calmer andrew returns to the gurney putting on his shirt
every problem has a solution
miguel approaches with tea purchased at the canteen
why are you getting dressed
youre not going to like this
please try to smile
andrew puts his arms around miguel
thanks for leaving school and coming here and
pulling back putting on his jacket i will be back
an hour tops
youre going to the office
youre not smiling
andrew rushes toward the exit doors
youre leaving the hospital
youre going into the office looking like that
are you insane
building heading for the entrance ext
but he changes his mind darting to the corner of the block
andrew stops to buy a baseball cap from a vendor
he trots down an alley past bags of garbage entering the building through a garage door
an emergency stairwell int
andrew passes camera out of breath
hes wearing the ball cap pulled to his eyebrows to hide blotches on his forehead
andrew opens the fire door on his floor at wyant wheeler removing the ball cap baring the purple blotches
day he walks quickly down the hall
passing a colleague andrew pretends to scratch his face attempting to hide the blotches as nonchalantly as possible
he dashes past an office ignoring anthea
didnt expect to see you
he ducks into his office
through papers int
startled when he sees shelby andrew spins toward the wall
im looking through the files but
call the messenger service have someone standing by
she reaches for the phone your phone
andrew keeps his face averted until shes out of the room
he goes to his computer the monitor already glowing
you brought the discs in you transferred
rachel comes into his office
i thought i was supposed to be covering for you
blurts out god andy you look awful
fucking word processing lost my kronos complaint
which must be filed by fucking five oclock
if its late theres no case
the mantra every problem has a solution
what can i do
get down to word processing
help jamey look
she rushes out
andrew begins shoving floppy discs into the slots on his computer bringing up each discs directory
he throws the disc to the floor
shoves in another
shoves in another bending it in half
he pulls open a file drawer dumping legal briefs onto the floor frantically spreading them around with his foot
andrew throws a document across the room takes a breath
he picks up the telephone
somethings come up
i dont want to upset charles but
letting down his guard oh shit bob the complaints due in forty minutes and i cant find it
suddenly no you dont have to come
hanging up the phone great
andrew rubs his eyes this is a nightmare
he switches off the overhead light
he slants the window blinds filling the room with shadow bob seidman comes into the office typically cheerful
cmon andy you didnt lose anything
seidman is struck by the mess in the office and andrews disheveled appearance
i dont know what to do bob
youll never find it in the dark
seidman flips on the overhead light
andrew gives up trying to hide the purple blotches facing his mentor straight on
what in gods name
whats wrong with your face
whats wrong with my face
you want to know whats wrong with my face
ive got a skin condition
next question bob
no more questions
now can you help me find the complaint
seidman sits in front of andys computer
what was the file name
k r o one
maybe you mistyped the name when you were saving it
well try combinations of those letters
seidman goes to work
andrew leans over his shoulder
youre right i probably just misfiled
walter kenton is standing at andrews door
his demeanor is casual
so casual it seems a little forced
some sort of problem
andrew has kept his face averted
but now he turns directly toward camera showing his face to kenton
some sort of major problem
there she is okay
you can relax now lisa
lisa miller has just given birth to a baby girl
she collapses on her pillow gasping for breath moaning in pain quietly crying a little
one month later
the nurses and the female doctor move professionally around the bed doing their jobs
at lisas side joe fumbles with a camera while darting amazed looks back and forth between lisa and the baby
oh my god
oh my god
oh my god
you load the film
no on this side
or this side
dont move the baby
give me the camera joe
lisa pops the film into the camera hands it back
oh my god
with wildly trembling hands joe begins snapping photos
oh my god

passing a patient in traction rolling by on a gurney joe drops a business card into the patients broken hand
to the patient give me a call
into the phone get everything over here as soon as you can shes starved
no not the baby
iris listen any calls i should know about

lisas hospital bed surrounded by debris from a party paper plates empty champagne bottle int
the relatives have gone
its late at night
lisa holds the baby
joe holds them both
movie palace now a six plex across the street from the peter pan coffee shop philadelphia workers going about the business of the day ext
one week later
above the peter pan coffee shop is a string of large windows each of which is painted with a question in bigger letters across several windows we hear joe millers
voice over how big was this hole you fell into
a hallway bulletin board announcing the various departments of macready and shilts legal services int
day including auto dui collisions with deer
the bulletin board stands at the entrance to a warehouse of lawyers cubicles formed by office dividers and plastic ferns
and this hole was right in the middle of the street
bands announcing its a girl
on the walls are photos of injured clients the same photos we saw in the background of joes tv commercial
a female client mrs
finley faces joe her arm in a sling
why didnt you cross at the crosswalk
why should i
very little hair shows beneath a phillies ballcap
a man wearing a neckbrace sitting next to andrew rises moving to a seat opposite andrew
from this new position the man with the neckbrace stares at andrew
the purple blotches on andrews face are beginning to recede not as angry looking as before thanks to chemo therapy
andrew is dressed casually in jeans and a softball jacket from the wyant wheeler team with andy embroidered over the heart
joes assistant iris approaches
andrew rises following iris past office dividers harried secretaries and overflowing file cabinets
iris cannot look at andrew as she walks beside him
outside joes door is a sign beware mad dog with mad written by hand
at the photos while joe wraps up
to the female client explain this to me like im a six year old okay
the entire street is clear except for one small area under construction with a huge hole that is clearly marked and blocked off and you decide you must cross the
street at this spot
you fall into the hole and you want to sue the city for negligence
do i have a case
of course you have a case
now i want you to go with my assistant iris and fill out some forms
shell tell you about our fee arrangement
as theyre leaving mrs
any back pain since the accident
now that you mention it
tell iris all about it
leading her out take good care of mrs
to andrew beckett come in
joe offers his hand getting a look at andrews face
jesus christ what happened to you
i have aids
joe withdraws his hand before it touches andrews
beat sorry i
can i sit down
joe doesnt sound sure
andrew sits joe returns to his desk
joe finds himself acutely aware of where andrew places his hands
the cigars new baby
one week old
little baby girl
kids are great
im real excited about it
glances at his watch what can i do for you
i was fired by wyant wheeler
i plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against charles wheeler and his partners
you want to sue wyant wheeler hellerman tetlow and brown
im seeking representation
i misplaced an important complaint
thats their story
want to hear mine
how many lawyers did you go to before you called me
i was diagnosed with aids eight months ago
during a bout of pneumonia
i recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days
since i was doing so well on the azt we decided against telling anyone about it
my lover and i
weve lived together for nine years
i dove back into work everything was fine
until the lesions started
hes wearing makeup which sort of covers the blotches
note picture and andrews voice over do not match up
this is no ordinary flashback
first on my leg
then my forearm my back
for a short period i avoided the office during the day waiting for the chemo therapy to clear up the lesions
but i never let anything slide
i made all my calls from home
i worked sixteen hour days on a complaint for a million dollar copyright infringement suit
but the day the complaint was due it disappeared
erased from my computer
i thought i was losing it mentally
that can happen its called aids dementia when it gets into your brain
but miraculously a copy of the complaint was located at the last minute and we got it to court on time
the next morning i was called to the office for a meeting with the managing partners
walking down that corridor was strange
felt like everyone was staring
hell they are staring
whats that shit on your face
the partners were waiting for me in the main conference room
pov as he enters the room where wheeler kenton killcoyne bob seidman are waiting int
sit down andy
wheelers secretary lydia takes notes
thanks for coming in
bob seidman cannot look directly at andrew
before we begin id just like to say everyone in this room is your friend
youre in trouble
note joe is seen in his office or leaning against a window in the conference room whenever he speaks
i know that charles
more than your friend
charles i must apologize again for the kronos mishap
smiling it was a scary few minutes around here
but thank god the complaint was found
and no damage was done
what about next time
there wont be a next time i guarantee it
it seems that something has come over you lately a kind of
stupor a fogginess a lack of focus
earth to andy
thats right andy
the last four five months youve seemed really out of it
keeping it positive perhaps
ive certainly been busy
with the kronos complaint a preliminary injunction hearing and the saunders trial all falling at the same time
some people think you have an attitude problem beckett
who thinks that sir
wheeler seems very grave
i had no idea there was a concern in that area
hey a smile ill get to work on it right away
no one else smiles
weve been talking it over andy
your future that is
we feel that because we respect you so much we have to be honest with you
honesty is always best
do you really think so andy
yes bob i do
to the group excuse me
am i being fired
lets put it this way andy your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure
in a word yes
we dont think its fair to keep you here where your future is limited
but we wish you luck andy all the luck in the world
wheeler rises wearing a friendly smile
and i hate to rush you out of here but
but hes got lots of other peoples lives to ruin
weve got a committee meeting
excuse me charles
with all due respect
it doesnt make any sense it sounds as if were talking about someone else
pardon the lack of humility but ive had the distinct impression i was kind of
one of the rising stars around here
and i feel that wasnt just my imagination
and i also think i deserve to know whats really going on here charles
oh youre right beckett you dont have an attitude problem
take it easy walter
if youd lost confidence in me why did you give me the kronos suit
i hoped the challenge would improve your performance
you could say it was a carrot
i buy that
as in the vegetable
suddenly emotional andy you nearly blew the case for gods sake
that alone is inexcusable
it would have been catastrophic for us
put yourself in our shoes andy
theres no coming back from an error like that regardless of who you are
softer im sorry andy
andrew freezes the full nature of this situation hitting home
he looks each of the partners in the eye
at last looking directly at wheelers secretary lydia whose pen is poised above her notebook waiting for someone to say something
wheeler breaks the silence
good luck andy
wheeler kenton killcoyne seidman and lydia file out
andrew doesnt move
a security guard enters the room
who are you
im here to escort you to your office so you can organize your belongings
explain to me like im a two year old because theres an element to this i cant get through my thick head didnt you have an obligation to inform your
employer you had this dreaded deadly infectious disease
andrew removes his ballcap his hair is cut short to disguise the effects of chemo
the law says people with disabilities cannot be terminated so long as they can perform the duties required by their position
they discover you have this horrible disgusting terminal illness and they panic for any number of perfectly valid reasons
theyre frightened for themselves their families
maybe its the homo angle
maybe they dont want to rub elbows with someone whos just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne
and how do they explain your status to the client for chrissake
joe from the day i arrived to the day they fired me i performed consistently thoroughly and with absolute excellence
and if they hadnt fired me thats what id be doing today
they want you out
its against the law to fire you for having aids so they make you look like a fuck up
which leads us to the mysterious lost file
they sabotaged me
i knew you were going to say that
i dont buy it and i dont see a case
i know i have a case
if you dont want to take it for personal reasons
andrew rises thoroughly business like
thanks for your time
im sorry about
whats happened to you
its a fucking kick in the head
a smile dont send flowers joe
im not dead yet
still uncomfortable as andrews leaving have a nice day
andrew nods passing one of joes colleagues a hustler named filko who stares shamelessly
joe approaches iriss desk
find out if armbruster can see me this afternoon
still staring what the hells wrong with him
close on andrew standing there as an endless flow of people passes by
he watches them go thinking
you had contact with someone who has aids and youre worried
im not worried
what are you doing
joe sits in his shirtsleeves on the examining table
checking your blood pressure relax
the doctor wraps the blood pressure unit around joes arm
i didnt have contact
what do you consider contact
we were sitting in the same room three four feet
what if you shake hands
i know the answer
only sex or sharing needles
i know that
we didnt shake hands anyway
armbruster squeezes the blood pressure pump the hiv virus can only be transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids namely blood and semen
joe begins rolling down his sleeve
yeah but doc isnt it true they keep finding out new things about this disease
so you tell me today theres no danger and i go home and i hold my baby and six months from now i hear on the news whoops
we were wrong
you can carry it on your clothes your skin and now ive got to worry about my kid
what are you doing
armbruster has been preparing a syringe
were going to draw blood
why are we going to do that
i dont care a whit about your private life
you want to give me an aids test joe hops off the table
the guy sat in my office
you cant get aids that way right
it doesnt travel through the air by breathing or touching right
not by touching or shaking hands or hugging using the same toilet
even kissing someone with aids is safe
but it theres something in your past youre worried about
thanks doc but i dont need an aids test
are you crazy
but thanks for the information
joe throws on his jacket opens the door
then turns back in my past
iv drug use
joe shakes his head
a homosexual encounter
unprotected sex with a prostitute
thinking it over uh
or unprotected sex with someone you didnt know very well any time during the last twelve years
joe returns to the examining table and rolls up his sleeve
you have a problem with gays joe
lisa eats standing up at the stove while joe walks the baby in their modern kitchen
how many gays do you know
how many do you know
my cousin tommy who lives in rochester
eddie meyers from the office
joe cantwell hes one of the partners
his lover greg
stanley the guy whos putting in our kitchen cabinets
for a moment joe is struck dumb
then he says your aunt teresa is gay
that beautiful sensuous woman is a
probably since she was born
i admit it im prejudiced
i dont want to work with a homosexual
you got me
i mean two guys doing the horizontal thing
i dont get it
dont they get confused
is that mine
i thought it was yours
hey call me old fashioned call me conservative
i think maybe you have to be a man to get just how nauseating the whole basic idea really is
and the way they work out pumping up so they can be macho and faggot at the same time
i cant stand that shit
now im being totally honest with you
thats perfectly clear
would you take a client if you were constantly thinking i hope this guy doesnt touch me
i dont even want him to breathe on me
decorated for christmas
joe steps out of the famous th st
deli with a package ext
two weeks later
books and legal pads hard at work
hes eating a pastrami sandwich which he hides behind a reference book when a librarian saunters by int
a chair squeaks and joe looks up to see andrew taking a seat across the room the blotches have been reduced by chemo but hes struggling with a cold
andrew removes notepads and pens from his briefcase
he takes out a package of tissues blowing his nose
under his breath shit
joe slides to the far end of his table stacking seven or eight huge reference books in front of him
andrew opens a book taking notes
rubs his eyes
a librarian delivers a book to andrew
this is the supplement
youre right there is a section on
lowers her voice hiv related discrimination
andrew takes the book from her but she remains
we have a private research room available
im fine thanks
andrew blows his nose
now other patrons are watching
wouldnt you be more comfortable in a research room
but would it make you more comfortable
the librarian turns away shrugging to a patron indicating shes done all she can do
as joe continues to watch one of andrews neighbors picks up his books and moves away
joe rises gliding down an aisle of books keeping one eye on andrew who concentrates on his work
joe approaches nonchalantly as if he just happens to be sauntering by
suddenly he notices andrew
hows it goin
andrew goes back to his work
whod you get
find a lawyer
im a lawyer
hows your baby
whats her name
andrew focuses on his work
joe steps away
joe comes back
how did they find out
a second then one of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead
nearby a chinese professor looks up startled when she hears the word lesion
andrew concentrates on his work once more
how do you get from one lawyer spotting a lesion which could have been a bruise to the partners deducing you had aids and basing a decision to terminate you
on that conclusion
the chinese professor moves away
andrew removes a legal pad with kenton written in big letters across the top and lots of notes underneath
the partner who spotted the lesion walter kenton used to work for benton myers in d
theres a paralegal there maria torres
shes had lesions on and off for three years
she says it was common knowledge around the office that her lesions were caused by aids
they didnt fire her
they didnt fire her
andrew goes back to his work
joe stands there
so kenton connected the
lesion and whatever suspicions he had about your personal life
to this woman maria
and blew the whistle on you
suddenly youre losing files and its time to let you go
but up to this point youve been their golden boy their rising star
their behavior is
andrew goes back to work
there is no relevant precedent
not looking up arline decision
andrew shoves the legal book toward joe
with one blotch on the books white pages
the book is still facing andrew
if joe wants to read it hell have to turn it around
joe looks at andrews hands
joe turns the book around begins to read the federal vocational rehabilitation act of prohibits discrimination
against otherwise qualified handicapped persons who are able to perform the duties required by their employment
although the ruling did not address the specific issue of hiv and aids discrimination
andrew and joe face each other at their table but no one else remains at that table or at the table next to it
subsequent decisions have held that aids is protected as a handicap under law not only because of the physical limitations it imposes
joe pacing andrew reading
their section of the library is completely empty but for andrew and joe
but because the prejudice surrounding aids exacts a social death which precedes the actual physical one
andrew and joe sit on the same side of the table reading the same book
this is the essence of discrimination formulating opinions about others not based on their individual merits but rather on their membership in a group with assumed characteristics
the library is quiet
joe scoots his chair away from andrew by eight inches
into each other sounds of grunts skin slapping against skin int
hand slapping a butt under satin shorts sweaty armpits
the roar of a crowd
basketball players embracing twirling each other around high fiving
wide angle reveals a basketball game in progress sixers versus the celtics in phillys spectrum arena
robert parish going for a lay up
watch this guy
charles wheeler walter kenton kenneth killcoyne bob seidman and several lawyers and spouses watch the game from a plush private box complete with tv bar snack table
the lawyers wear ralph lauren polos chinos and ball caps
the place reeks of cigar smoke
walter kenton has a twentyfive year old wife
charles wheelers nine year old grandson sits nearby
wheeler turns the grandsons ballcap around smiling lovingly at the boy
just beyond wheeler the door to the box is opened by a security guard and a well dressed charismatic man looks in
spotting him julius
julius erving enters greeted by the lawyers
hows it goin doctor
this is an honor
the door is opened again by the security guard revealing joe miller in jeans and basketball jacket and a marshall
joe slaps a document into wheelers hand
now the box is quiet
whats up chuck
night where wheeler walks beside bob seidman with walter kenton and kenneth killcoyne just behind
sounds of the game still in progress can be heard but far away
occasionally the lawyers are passed by food service or laundry interview every employee support staff associates partners
did any of them know andy was sick
how did they know
did he tell them
did they notice something was wrong with his appearance
none of this information got to the managing partners
we know that
make sure everyone else does too
and beckett i want to know everything about his personal life
did he frequent those pathetic bars on camac street
ignoring seidman what about other homosexual facilities whatever they are
what deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to
with irritation what is it bob
lets settle with andy and put this whole tragic mess behind us
they arrive at a quiet semi private cul de sac
andrew brought aids into our offices into our mens room
he brought aids to our annual goddamn family picnic
we ought to be suing him
for christs sake wheres your compassion
andy sucks cocks bob
he takes it up the ass
hes a pervert
only seidman shows any kind of reaction
thats kind of
andys private life is none of our business
youre trying my patience
andrew beckett is making his private life our business
we gave him kronos
did he say im sick
i might not be able to see this through
he was doing a great job
i must ask you to shut the fuck up
did andrew beckett say i might not be able to serve our clients to the best of my ability he said nothing
and now andrew beckett proposes to haul me into a court of law to sling accusations at me in full view of the entire philadelphia judicial establishment
beckett doesnt want to go to court hes hoping for a quick tasty settlement
a jury might decide that andy has a case
wait a minute
the man was fired for incompetence not because he has aids
you didnt know he was sick did you bob
did you bob
after a moment no
wheeler walks away followed by kenton and killcoyne
bob seidman stands alone in this dark place
jobs colleague filko looking directly into camera in joes offices int
day charles fucking wyant wheeler
joe sweeps by just arriving for work
filko keeps pace with joe down the corridor
another colleague calls out from an office as joe passes hey its the local chapter of the aclu
youre a republican joe
you belong to the nra
how many toilet stalls are there in the womens restroom on this floor filko
filko follows joe into joes office
how many toilet stalls are there in the mens room
two plus four urinals
how many wheelchair accessible toilets in either of those restrooms
in this entire building
get the picture filko
discrimination you find yourself a female paraplegic legal assistant who is qualified to work here except she cant take a leak
and youve got yourself a sex discrimination suit and a handicapped discrimination suit
what do you call someone who cant use a normal restroom
gastro intestinally challenged
behind joe out a large window painters on a scaffold
iris comes into the office and says wyant wheelers asking for a postponement on the prelim joe
joe is dialing the phone
low life sleazy scumbags
of course they want a postponement ive got a client with a terminal disease
theyre going to drag their heels every step of the way the rotten bastards
tapping on the window to the is that spelled right
exterior joes office building where painters are adding a new question to the line of windows day hey beckett

andrew and miguels loft int
day i just wanted to tell you
camera drifts through the loft finding andrew in the rooftop solarium sitting crosslegged in front of a candle
were trying to set a date for the prelim
hang in there
andrews eyes are closed
next to him rests a tape player
a womans voice is heard accompanied by new age music i can heal myself
i can heal myself
i can heal myself
i can heal myself
each other in bed int
i was coming out of the gym today and i ran into jimmy
do you know what he asked me
whats it like knowing your boyfriends going to die
what did you say
i said everyones going to die jimmy
but drews not going to die of aids
theres a cure around the corner and he plans to be around to take advantage of it
miguel strokes andrews hair
you got that right mikey
beat you still believe that dont you
i think it will be a simple solution
theyll put it in a syringe inject it into your bloodstream
itll neutralize the virus
itll revitalize the immune system and people with aids will become healthy again
three months later
corridor two figures walk toward camera int
the figures approaching camera are andrew and joe stepping into and out of sunlight falling through tall windows
pre trial settlement conference
a phalanx of lawyers at least ten approaching camera a bulwark of white shirts and dark ties
andrews hair is short but growing back the blotches have receded his weight is up
hes in a stage of recovery
charles wheeler seeming ironic and walter kenton hes pissed lead the battalion
behind them walk young lawyers belinda conine and jerome green
belinda is white jerome is black
a judges chambers with couches soft chairs scattered in a loose circle like a casual living room
joe and andrew whisper to each other
the wyant wheeler team takes up several chairs
belinda conine and jerome green sit next to wheeler and kenton
some of their assistants stand
wheeler is looking across the room at
andrew who catches wheelers stare
youre looking better andy
how do you feel
everyone watches andrew for his reaction
fine thanks charles
judge lucas garnett enters his chambers not wearing a judges robe
he shakes hands with wheeler and kenton
congratulations on the new grandson
were very happy
the judge brushes by joe and andrew without a word
the room becomes silent as the judge takes a seat
attorney for the plaintiff
joseph miller your honor
macready and shilts legal services
ive seen your television commercials
if you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others
it should say through the negligence of others
ill take that under consideration your honor
on behalf of the defendants
of petersen lehigh monroe and smith
and jerome green
and a waspish lawyer wearing round glasses dexter smith
a white haired lawyer next to belinda ralph petersen
to joe youre outnumbered four to one
to the others whom do i address
i cant talk to four lawyers at once
im chief litigator your honor
ive asked the litigants to be present for this conference in the hope we can settle this matter today among ourselves
there is nothing i hate more than to see lawyers suing each other
if you look at the opinion polls when mr
citizen is asked to rank professions according to the respect he holds for them
where are the lawyers
somewhere below personal fitness trainers and only slightly above child pornographers
if we keep suing each other if we fail to settle the smallest difference among ourselves with mutual respect if we continue to scrap like bucks in heat well fall
lower on that list
and when people lose respect for lawyers they lose respect for the law
and when this society loses all respect for the law well be murdered in our beds my friends our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground and our children
and our grandchildren will live like savages
if it please your honor we hope to settle this matter
by god you will settle it
if you force this case to trial young man youll regret it for the rest of your natural born days
what would you require to settle this matter today
reinstatement at full salary
back pay covering the period of unemployment and
hold it joe
to wheeler he wants to come back to work chuck
thats impossible your honor
thats impossible joe
if it please your honor were prepared to offer a cash settlement of twenty five thousand dollars
your generosity overwhelms me belinda considering my client was earning over a hundred thou when he was terminated almost six months ago
give me a break joe
lets cut through these false attitudes
give them a figure
how much do you want
want to go back to work your honor
youre here at my indulgence young man
im waiting for a figure joe
andrew and joe confer with each other
based on what my client would have earned over the next three years including benefits and projected raises and the extraordinary cost of medical care for someone with acquired immune
we would settle today for the very fair amount of one million five hundred thousand dollars
very good joe
now belinda ive got a figure over here of one million five
andrew whispers to joe who interrupts the judge one more thing your honor
jumping in any settlement agreement must include and this is critical a letter of exoneration making clear my termination had nothing to do with the quality of my work
charles wheeler whispers to belinda conine
your honor mr
becketts incompetence nearly sabotaged a million dollar suit
was the one who was sabotaged
we have complaints about mr
becketts lack of preparation his disorganization his arrogant defensive attitude
the list goes on
we have letters
why havent you produced these letters
take it easy
to wheeler whats the big deal chuck
the boy wants a letter to show to his mother for her to keep after hes gone
why are you being hard assed about this
i wish i could exonerate you andy
but id have to lie to do it
very calm you can save it for the jury charles
i want to hear you say under oath in front of a judge and a jury im a bad lawyer
to belinda counselor
dont do this andy
to andrew what do you expect them to say youre alan dershowitz
a trial takes time beckett
do you know what im saying
i think i catch your subtle drift walter
andrew saunters out
youll be sorry beckett
andy you dont want this
joe scans the room all eyes are on him
his frown turns into a grin
he faces the judge
with all due respect your honor my client chooses to pursue his constitutionally guaranteed right to a trial
colonial house in downington pennsylvania ext
andrew walks toward the house talking directly to camera
this is the house where i grew up
in downington pennsylvania
pointing to the ground see this
the camera points to several pairs of childs hand prints in the sidewalk then back to andrew in close up smiling
those are my cute little hand prints
and my brothers and my sisters

andrew goes inside speaking to the camera this is the front door
i caught a finger in this door once

stepping inside this is the hallway my mother calls it a foyer
children are running through the house while women sporting corsages confer in the kitchen

andrews older and very down to earth sister jill puts her arms around andrew squeezing tight
this is my sister jill the most fertile woman on the planet
shes married to reverend jim

over andrews shoulder hello miguel
as jill leaves andrews arms the camera is traded off to andrew who shoots jill giving miguel a hug
nice to see you sweetheart
hugging miguel handsome devil
referring to andrew is he eating

da duh da duh da duh

jill holds the hand of her husband reverend jim
two of andrews brothers matt and randy big athletic guys with mustaches are there
andrew sits next to miguel
things might be said at the trial that
are not going to be easy for you to hear
things about me about my private life
and i want to make sure its okay with everybody
i appreciate you asking andy but really its your call
what do you think jill
to be honest im worried about mommy and daddy
theyve had to go through so much already
and we all know
very difficult to say theres going to be even worse things to deal with eventually
i wonder if its fair to put them through this
andrews father stares at his folded hands
all i know is you got through your diagnosis fine like a trooper
but when they fired you
you were so devastated andy
i dont expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus
fight for your rights
theres a pause before bud beckett speaks
supposedly the lord doesnt give you more trouble than you can handle
but im having a hard time believing that these days
andrews construction worker brother randy wipes tears from his eyes
clearly their father is in alot of pain
andy the way youve faced this whole thing you and miguel with so much courage
your mother and i have been so very impressed
andrew gazes at his father with incredible love
miguel puts an arm around andrew
i cant imagine there is anything that anyone could say that would make us feel less proud of you
full of emotion thanks dad
i love you guys
how about you randy
youre my kid brother andy
thats the bottom line
i mean what are those bastards going to say
shit i knew that when you were five years old
andrew and randy high five
wait a minute
to andrew youre gay more laughter
but jill speaks seriously what about you andy
youre not a militant type
youve always been so private
i dont have time for that any more
will you lead us in a prayer
everyone bows heads holding hands in a circle
sometimes it is difficult to remember to be grateful
to remember in our times of sorrow and confusion that we have you to turn to and each other
bless and keep andrew and miguel dear lord deepen and strengthen their love as they face the struggles that lay ahead
bless and watch over all of us fill us with your love your light and your peace which passeth all understanding
in jesus name we pray

the marine is a juror
camera pans others a black lady schoolteacher a postal worker an asian college student
no one will break down on the stand with a tearful confession
you are presented with a simple fact andrew beckett was fired
you will hear two explanations for why he was fired
joe crosses the courtroom coming to stand in front of
andrew whose appearance has changed thinner paler than weve ever seen him some blisters on his lips
but the most disturbing thing about his appearance is the way he moves slowly like a much older man
hes taking notes which he will do relentlessly throughout the trial
and he has a cane at his side which hell use throughout the trial
its up to you to sift through layer and layer of truth and determine for yourselves the version that sounds the most true
charles wheeler walter kenton bob seidman kenneth killcoyne sit behind their lawyers belinda conine and jerome green and several assistants at the defense table
judge garnett presides from his bench
among the spectators miguel sits next to sarah and andrews sister jill
aids activists in the background
there are certain points in our version that i must prove to you
point number one andrew beckett was
is a brilliant lawyer
a great lawyer
point number two
andrew beckett afflicted with a debilitating disease made the legal understandable personal choice to keep the fact of his illness to himself
point number three his employers discovered his illness
and ladies and gentlemen the illness im referring to is joe pauses letting that sink in
point number four
and in their panic they did what most of us would like to do with aids
get it and the people who have it as far away from us as possible
joe walks away from andrew
the behavior of andrew becketts employers may seem reasonable to you
it does to me
after all aids is a deadly incurable disease
but however you come to judge the behavior of charles wheeler and his partners in moral ethical human terms
when they fired andrew beckett because he had they broke the law with a swift direct glance at the judge joe speaks with considerable power and emotion and when lawyers
break the law when this society loses respect for the law when that day comes our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground and our children and grandchildren will live like savages
andrew beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level
he made a grievous error on a multi million dollar lawsuit
he claims he is the victim of lies and deceit
andrew beckett lied to his employers going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them
he was successful in his duplicity
the partners at wyant wheeler did not know andrew beckett had aids when they fired him
belinda pauses in front of the plaintiffs table fact
aids is a tragedy
andrew looks directly at belinda
andrew beckett is dying
joe watches andrew for his reaction
andrew beckett is angry
because his lifestyle his reckless behavior has cut short his life
and in his anger his rage hes lashing out
and he wants someone to pay large insurance company mr
andrew beckett represented your company in a lawsuit in is that correct
wyant wheeler represented us
andrew glances toward the jury box the marine juror writes in a tiny notebook
but andrew beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit
were you pleased with his work
we were satisfied
joe and andrew exchange a look lairds response surprises and disappoints them
were you satisfied or were you pleased
laird glances toward charles wheeler before answering
we were satisfied
joe refers to legal documents
laird when i approached you about being a witness at this trial and you agreed you gave sworn testimony in a deposition
is that correct
according to the deposition you said you were thrilled impressed overwhelmed by the quality of andrew becketts work
do you remember saying that
i may have said something like that
but thats not how i feel at this moment
joe takes on a street tough tone okay mr
explain this to me like im a four year old did andrew beckett win your lawsuit for you or not
did that thrill impress and overwhelm you
it satisfied me
joe stares at the guy
its a long way between being overwhelmed and being satisfied
a cheeseburger may be satisfying whereas caviar and champagne and roast duck and baked alaska for dessert might be considered overwhelming
do you agree
five months ago you characterized andrew beckett as caviar and now youre calling him a cheeseburger
your standards have shifted a great deal and id like to know why youve changed your mind
since that time ive devoted more thought to the subject and thats how i feel now
partner robert seidman was the supervising attorney for your lawsuit
does the supervising attorney guide the litigating attorney during the trial
often he does
as far as you know in the handling of your lawsuit andrew beckett was simply following orders
thats a fair assessment of the situation
andrew glances over his shoulder at robert seidman who meets his gaze
activists in t shirts with pink triangles denouncing discrimination born again activists waving placards citing aids as gods punishment for homosexuality policemen keeping them apart a media circus getting it
joe and miguel flank andrew who walks weakly
with a cane sarah and jill follow close behind running the gauntlet of activists and reporters
andrews pov on a placard we die they do nothing
jills pov on a placard aids cures homosexuality
a tv crew shines hot lights on andrew
do you see this as a gay rights issue
im not political
i just want compensation for being fired
but you are gay arent you
i dont see how thats any of your business
a smile but yes i am
a microphone is shoved at joe
do you believe that homosexuals deserve special treatment
joe on tv angela were standing in philadelphia the city of brotherly love the birthplace of freedom where our founding fathers authored the declaration of independence
and i dont remember that glorious document saying all straight men are created equal
i could have sworn it says all men are created equal
give me a goddamn break
the reporter wraps up her story
this case is sending a cold chill through the legal community
one of wyant wheelers key clients the grace foster foundation which supports several aids charities has taken its business to another firm until this matter is resolved
as the tv drones on charlie the cop others glare at joe
chuckles hey joe
a wink to the cop youre not starting to get a little
light on your feet here on us are you
joe does not laugh
stepping toward filko im on the prowl filko
i need a man
not just any man
i need a hunk
a hunk like you
how about it filko
want to play sailor
this time ill be first mate and you can be columbus
chill out joe
angry those people make me sick filko
but a laws been broken okay
the law remember the law
charlie the cop has relaxed a bit
at least we agree on one thing joe
they make me sick too
hold on joe but we hear the tv reporter in the background
now the public knows that your son has aids and hes gay
how does that make you feel
all eyes turn to the tv sarah beckett in close up
this is a world full of war famine poverty homelessness
and people make a fuss because two men or two women want to live together or make love
seems kind of silly doesnt it
the bar erupts with a chorus of boos and catcalls
and walter kenton knew the lesions on your face and arms were caused by aids
the witness maria torres hispanic healthy looking
people were going around whispering things
i figured i didnt have anything to lose so i told all the partners
how did walter kenton treat you after you told him you had aids
close on kenton looking confident
every time he came into contact with me hed get this look on his face
i called it the oh god expression
as in oh god here comes that woman with andrew laughs
have your employers fired you for having aids
when i need time off for medical reasons we work it out
no more questions
jerome green rises
how did you contract the aids virus
during a transfusion
i lost a lot of blood giving birth to my second child
in other words in your case you happen to be an innocent victim of the aids tragedy
im no different from everyone else who has this disease im not guilty im not innocent
im just trying to survive
beyond noticing the marks on his face were there other things about his appearance that made you suspect he had the witness paralegal anthea burton
he was losing weight
he looked kind of tired sometimes
but he was working so hard
still i felt something was wrong
looking at wheeler and i cant believe theyre saying they didnt notice anything
just answer the question
is that a question
have you ever felt discriminated against at wyant wheeler
wheeler shakes his head disgusted
kenton fumes outraged
seidman looks surprised
in what way
one time mr
wheelers secretary lydia told me mr
wheeler had a problem with my earrings
anthea is wearing large dangling african style earrings
wheeler felt they were too
ethnic is the word she used
she said he would like it if i wore something smaller less garish and
what did you say
i said my earrings are american
theyre african american
no more questions
belinda conine approaches anthea
do you still work at wyant wheeler
were you recently promoted
im now in charge of the paralegal department
cold medicines carrying a box of pampers int
a young man in grass stained sweats carrying a football under one arm buying a tube of toothpaste speaks to joe hows the trial going
its a great case
joe looks up surprised
the young man smiles
i saw you on television
im a law student
joe is flattered by the young mans interest
would you like to have a drink with me
i just finished a game i could use a beer
a smile i dont pick up people in drug stores every day
whoa whoa whoa whoa
do you think
you think im low gay
whats the matter with you
do i look gay to you
do i look gay to you
i ought to kick your faggoty little ass for you
take it as a compliment
but joe is really upset
people are watching
dont you know this is exactly the kind of bullshit that makes people hate you guys
you want to kick my ass
you want to try
walking away asshole
youre the asshole buddy
going out get a life
joe stands there holding the pampers people staring
around her desk really upset one year old rayisha sits on the desk playing with wooden salad spoons
but what was it
what was this guy thinking
dont know joe
is there some kind of expression ive picked up from beckett
some kind of fairy attitude ive unconsciously adopted
am i walking different
some kind of vocal thing
have i picked up some kind of homo vibe have you changed your aftershave
i had a box of pampers under my arm for chrissake
almost completely obscured by shadow int
they speak softly careful not to wake the baby
two men making love
now tell me again
why is that disgusting
a tired sigh lisa cmon
one guy sticking his dick in another guys mouth
they lie in silence for a moment
then okay so
help me with this one joe
is it disgusting for someone to put his dick into someones mouth
or is it disgusting for someone to take a dick into their mouth
after a beat great lisa
but ultimately the complaint was found wasnt it
we found a copy
it been incorrectly filed
plaintiffs case day ten
we got it to court on time
angle on the jury several jurors write in notebooks like the marines hes been handing them out
joe seems ill at ease today a little off his game
when he glances at andrew its with irritation
has a file ever disappeared like that before
vanished into thin air all of a sudden only to reappear in the nick of time
jamey answers nervously ive never known that to happen before
fires this question did you have something to do with this file being lost accidentally on purpose
to jamey did you have anything to do with this file being
joe stands staring at jamey
are you a homosexual
joe pressing forward toward jamey
are you homosexual
you know gay
the courtroom erupts activists booing joe wheelers crowd expressing outrage jurors looking confused
andrew takes in the commotion as the judge bangs his gavel
hold it hold it
andrew trains his attention on joe
where has this come from
suddenly counsel is attacking his own witness
collins sexual orientation has absolutely no relevance to this case
i said hold it
the courtroom quiets mr
could you kindly share with me exactly whats going on in your brain because i dont have a clue at the moment
joe faces andrew also curious to know what joes up to
your honor everyone in this courtroom is thinking about sexual preference sexual orientation whatever you want to call it
theyre looking at me and wondering about it
looking at andrew theyre looking at mr
beckett and wondering about it
theyre looking at mr
wheeler and wondering about it
they might even be looking at you and wondering about it
so lets get it out in the open
lets talk about what this case is really about the general publics hatred
our loathing our fear of homosexuals
dead silence while the judge thinks it over
to himself very good
close on jamey collins sweating bullets on the stand
in this courtroom mr
miller justice is blind
to matters of race creed color religion
and sexual orientation
with all due respect your honor
we dont live in this courtroom do we
however as regards this witness im going to sustain the defenses objection
the marine juror the retired postal worker juror and an uptight businessman juror stand at the urinals with an empty urinal between each of them
the marine juror whistles while he pees a classic rock tune like radar love
the businessman sighs ahhhhhh
the retired postal worker juror jingles change
the rock musician juror enters stepping up to the urinal between the businessman and the marine
he unzips and it seems to take him an incredibly long time to extricate his urinary organ
this does not escape the marines notice
innocently to marine i have some gay friends
whats the biggie
the marine says nothing
everybody has a couple of gay friends
i do not
the marine moves closer to the urinal so that no one can see his private parts
you might have them and just not know theyre gay
the marine shakes zips flushes turns away
he pauses to look directly at the rock musician juror
and how many weeks at a time would you be out to sea without stopping at port
anywhere from two weeks to several months
any women on board
kenton glances at the marine juror
not when i was in the navy
so during those long voyages months at a time out to sea no women in sight a hundred hardworking robust young men in the prime of their life at the
peak of their natural appetites desires their god given hormonal instincts anything going on
two sailors playing hide the salami
andrew covers his face with his hands
cant resist we had one guy like that
you havent ruled on my objection your honor
kenton seems eager to tell his story
joe stands with crossed arms waiting
to kenton you had one guy like that
but we took care of him
how did you do that
we stuck his head in the latrine after ten of us had used it
laughter and some applause from some spectators and some jurors
activists boo and hiss
the judge pounds his gavel
you taught him a lesson
yes we did
like firing andrew beckett taught him a lesson
moving on quickly you were aware when you worked with maria torres that she had aids correct
she didnt try to conceal it
so you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise is that correct
know the difference
that doesnt mean im always able to recognize the difference
but didnt you avoid contact with ms
torres after you found out she had aids
she says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her is that correct
i felt and still feel nothing but the deepest sympathy and compassion for people like maria who have contracted this terrible disease through no fault of their own
into an iv drip unit int
miguel glances at a chart on the wall in which a day is broken into hours with medical instructions for each hour shouting over music drew
are you ready
if we start at eight well be done by twelve
miguel taps the iv bag getting the drip started
a cat jumps onto the counter
miguel holds it
pad holding out his left arm int
a catheter is imbedded into andrews arm and miguel is trying to get the iv drip started through the catheter
the music is lower
its not going through

miguel shoves away from the table

miguel slides down the wall sitting in a heap
andrew goes to him
miguel holds him tight

miguel rocks in andrews arms
andrew kisses the top of his head holding tight

a man dressed as la toya jackson with fake snake squeezes past joe reaching for a beer
scuse me darling
andrew is smiling at joe
you think im uncomfortable
joe spills beer down his shirt
andrew and miguel rocking to heavy metal music playing a battle of the guitars
at one point andrew has to sit down but he doesnt stop playing while miguel jumps all around him
joe talking to a man dressed as marie antoinette im an accountant

lisa climbs into the cab which she is sharing with the nun and marie antoinette and la toya
joe opens his briefcase removing a legal pad with notes
andrew clears away party debris from the table making space for his legal work
he is attached to an iv line which is connected to a drip bag on a rolling stand that can move with him
he is no longer in costume
you survived your first gay party intact
let me tell you something okay
when youre brought up like the rest of us in a place like where i was brought up theres not a whole lot of discussion about
as a kid youre taught right away that queers are weird queers are funny theyre a danger to kids theyre afraid to fight and they all want to cop your
and that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there if you want to know the truth
thank you for sharing that with me joe
lets review these notes for your testimony
we have a big day on monday
joe begins ticking off a list of courtroom reminders when you refer to wheeler call him charles to show how youd been admitted to the inner circle you were considered
one of them
distracted uh huh
theyre having a personal conversation
joe goes back to the notes then we establish how wheelers boys recruited you after law school
what have you prayed for
for a healthy baby
for lisa to make it through the delivery
for the phillies to get into the playoffs
no self pity theres a possibility i wont be around for the end of this trial
ive considered that
we proceed representing your estate
ive made provisions in my will for some charities
miguel will need a lawyer
i know its not your area
i know a good probate lawyer
a beat do you like opera
andrew moves to the stereo pulling the iv line with him
want to hear my favorite aria
startling joe with its volume
over the music andrea chenier by giordano
this is madeleine
shes telling how during the french revolution a mob set fire to her house
her mother died saving her
the place that cradled me was burning
do you hear the heartache in her voice
then here come the strings
the music fills with hope
andrew sways through the room to the music pulling the iv at his side
he seems truly free and relaxed
it was during that sorrow that love came to me
a voice filled with harmony that said
live still i am life
i am the god that descends from the heavens to the earth to make of the earth a heaven
angle on joe shifting uncomfortable
i am oblivion
i am glory
i am love love love
the music ends
joe sits there fidgeting
he reaches for his briefcase organizing his notes
i think ill
i told lisa
andrew collects himself as joe rises from his chair
andrew follows joe to the door
businesslike ill look over the q and a
youre ready dont worry
an awkward moment both men standing with their hands at their sides will one of them initiate a handshake
joe gives a little salute then leaves
suddenly joe hears opera music playing again
he pauses listening
passionate music int
the iv stand catches against the sofa tugging the line
andrew pulls the line out of his arm
he moves freer now
joe lifts his hand to knock
he changes his mind
joe moves down the corridor rings for the elevator
music pull him along int
the doors closing
joe crosses the yard to his dark house
joe looks down on the baby adjusting the blanket
joe doffs his jacket sinking quietly onto the edge of the bed careful not to disturb lisa
with his back to camera joe puts his head into his hands
and begins to weep
andrew moves very slowly with his cane across the courtroom toward the witness stand
judge garnett crosses his arms waiting
joe glances at some notes
miguel and sarah beckett look on anxiously
wheeler and the others observe in silence
the bailiff places the bible in front of andrew a purple blotch is showing in front of andrews ear place your left hand on the bible and raise your right
andrew places his hand on the bible
do you swear to tell the truth
wyant wheeler had aggressively recruited me
they were the most prestigious firm in philadelphia full of opportunity
and i was impressed by the partners
including charles wheeler
andrew frequently wipes sweat from his forehead with a handkerchief
his voice is hoarse raspy
what impressed you about him
the kind of person i thought i wanted to be
what kind of person is that
possessed of an encyclopedic knowledge of the law
a razor sharp litigator a genuine leader gifted at bringing out the very best in others
an awesome ability to illuminate the most complex of legal concepts to colleagues courtrooms the person on the street
a smile the kind of person who plays three sets of tennis but doesnt sweat
but underneath the elegant surface was an adventurous spirit
belinda conine makes a note about that
obviously at this time you werent sick
its possible i was infected with the hiv virus at that time but i wasnt diagnosed until several years later
you didnt look then the way you look now
pre aids andrew
i was thirty pounds heavier
i was athletic
a regular all american guy
i suppose you could say that
you were gay
i still am
in the years you worked at wyant wheeler did you ever tell charles wheeler you were gay
can you explain why you didnt
you dont bring your personal life into a law firm
youre not supposed to have a personal life really
anyway i did plan to tell charles eventually
but then this thing happened at the tennis club
longstreets interested in the harrisburg deal
im seeing him this afternoon
somebody started telling jokes
what do you call a woman who has pms and esp at the same time
a bitch who knows everything
andrew keeps his eyes closed leaning against the wall of the sauna next to wheeler relaxing
how does a faggot fake an orgasm
andrew opens one eye
he spits on your back
charles thats revolting
all the men laugh and wheeler laughs the hardest
how did that make you feel
image back to the courtroom
andrew in the witness stand and its the sick thin andrew with aids
that id never told him i was gay
angle on charles wheeler shakes his head a denial
are you a good lawyer
im an excellent lawyer
what makes you an excellent lawyer
i love the law
i know the law
i excel at practicing it
its the only thing ive ever wanted to do
what do you love about it
but i think the thing i love the most is that every once in a while not that often but occasionally
you get to be part of justice being done
its really quite a thrill when that happens
you said earlier you aspired to be the kind of person who had an adventurous spirit
is that correct
something like that
do you take risks
in my work
you have to
do you take risks in other areas of your life
not unnecessary ones
have you ever been to the apollo cinema on sansom street
joe cringes a little with discomfort
looking belinda right in the eye a few times
what kind of movies do they show there
gay pornographic movies
do men have sex with each other in that theater
how about you mr
have you ever had sex with someone in that theater
andrew steps into the booth
now what do we do
robert laughs closing the door of the booth
i think well figure it out
joe sits with a stone sober expression this isnt easy
approximately what year did this event take place
i guess it was
were you aware in or that there was a fatal disease out there called aids and that you could contract it through sexual activity
its impossible to know exactly when or how i was infected with hiv
but you were having anonymous sex in porno theaters in and
that happened once
people werent talking about aids then the way we are now
or safe sex
youd heard of aids in
id heard of something the gay plague gay cancer but
we didnt know how you could get it or that it could kill you
close shot on andrew losing strength
sounds far away do you need a break
while you were employed at wyant wheeler you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual correct
that is not correct
i never lied about it
did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk
do other lawyers at the firm keep pictures of their spouses or fiances on their desks
as a homosexual one is often forced to conceal ones sexuality is that right
in some situations
isnt it true you have spent your life pretending to be something youre not so much so that the art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you
ill withdraw it
were you living with miguel alvarez in or when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater
angle on miguel sitting next to sarah
you could have infected him isnt that right
miguel has not been infected
as i said we werent aware of aids then or how it is spread
andrew wipes sweat from his forehead
youve testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with correct
and its your contention that when the partners were made aware of the lesions they jumped to the conclusion you had aids and fired you
do you have any lesions on your face at this time
here in front of my ear
an assistant hands conine a shaving mirror
she holds it before andrew
remembering you are under oath answering truthfully can you see the lesion on your face in this mirror three feet away
andrew looks in the mirror the lesion is not very visible
by the time i was fired there were four lesions on my face much bigger
answer the question please
i cant really see it
andrew rubs his eyes
far away this would be a good time to break for the day
far away your honor
may i have ten minutes in re direct
far away beckett
andrew finds the judge looking at him
can you go on for ten minutes
joe jumps up from the plaintiffs table
i only need five
to belinda reaching for the mirror may i
joe approaches andrew with the mirror
do you have any lesions on any part of your body at this time that resemble the lesions that were on your face at the time you were fired
on my torso
if it please the court id like to ask mr
beckett to remove his shirt so that the jury can have an accurate idea of what were talking about
we object your honor
it would unfairly influence the jury
your honor if mr
beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair would the defense ask him to park it outside
were talking about aids were talking about lesions
lets see what were talking about
a moment then ill allow it
would you mind removing your shirt mr
the courtroom turns silent
andrew removes his suit jacket
hes weak so the smallest gesture requires effort
andrew undoes his tie
andrew unbuttons his collar buttons working his way down
andrew stands pulling his shirttails out of his trousers
andrew removes his shirt there are purple blotches the schoolteacher juror gasps
sarah beckett is silently crying
the lesbian juror closes her eyes
can you see the lesions on your chest in this mirror
charles wheeler strides down the corridor flanked by kenton killcoyne and belinda discussing strategy
bob seidman steps to wheelers side keeping pace
ive discovered something interesting charles
to belinda keep them from that area on grounds of relevancy
to seidman what bob
no matter how hard i try i cant lose a file in my computer
now hes got everyones attention
the system automatically makes a backup
belinda holds up both hands interrupting with i dont think i should hear this
she walks away giving a glance over her shoulder as you can erase the backup
a challenge to wheeler but why would you
venomous whats the point bob
calm very interesting bob
lets make a note of that
andy didnt lose the complaint in his computer
he never put it in
he lied about that too
if you feel differently bob you should say so when youre called to the stand
after all this isnt a conspiracy
wheeler and the gang moves on leaving seidman alone in the high ceilinged corridor
belinda hesitates before re grouping with wheeler and the rest casting a curious glance toward bob seidman
why did you recruit andrew beckett to your firm
andrew uses all his strength to concentrate
charles wheeler speaks with great sincerity
if youre the owner of a major league ball club you recruit the hot rookie
and andy was tremendously promising as a young attorney
thats why we went after him thats why we hired him and thats why we stuck with him year after year
waiting for the promise to be fulfilled
but it never was
you kept giving him another chance
of course we did
when youve groomed someone they way we groomed andy nurturing him lavishing all kinds of special treatment on him
youve made quite an investment
we were waiting for his promise to kick in and deliver
but ultimately we could no longer ignore the gap between the promise and the reality
this is one of the saddest times in my life
to sit in this court testifying to andys ultimate failure to make the grade
to discover that he is one of those people who wants to benefit by the system but doesnt want to play by the systems rules
to think you know someone only to find out
you dont know them at all
thats all for now your honor
adjusts his jacket
very gentle explain to me if you can mr
wheeler explain this to me like im a ten year old
this trial is not about a disease is that what youre saying
not about your understandable if unfounded fear of catching aids through casual contact with someone who has it
youre saying this trial is about andrew becketts character
am i getting this right
to the extent that it affects a persons ability to do a great job
andrew looks away face shiny with sweat breathing difficult
he takes in the rest of the court while wheelers words throb through the air
andy worked when he wanted to work telling us what he thought we needed to know about his lifestyle
andrews pov on rachel sitting among the spectators
rachel begins speaking her words overlapping wheelers we should get the feeling shes giving her testimony
i didnt mind covering for andy but i did wonder
when was he planning to deal with his problem
whats going on
looking back to the court joe presses in on wheeler
everything seems normal
sometimes it seems like society is run by these kinds of people
what kind of people
people who want to bend the rules
andrews pov kenneth killcoyne at the defense table if you want to be a leader in this society you have to make certain sacrifices
wheeler keeps speaking to suit their personal desires and the rest of us have to live with it
you have to make a decision is this guy partner material
who makes the rules mr
yes i did see the lesions
i suspected he was sick
close on andrew closing his eyes
the everyday common person with decent values
it seems like he wasnt willing to face the reality of his situation
andrew slowly rises the voices getting louder i didnt tell the others i was afraid to
but now were standing up for ourselves
but we shouldnt have fired him
its time to get this society back on track
andrew opens his eyes
we switch to his pov the judge the jury everyone silent looking concerned
andrews pov of the courtroom floor
andrew falls into his own pov shot
in slow motion
he lies on the floor looking up
andrews pov joe steps over him
could you call an ambulance please
working frenetically trying to intubate andrew who is having serious trouble breathing his body heaving
the tube theyre trying to put in place seems to be making matters worse
miguel stands to the side furious its making it worse
take it out
take it out
gillman rushes into the room in street clothes obviously having answered an emergency call
she tries assessing the situation just as the tube is removed and andrew gasps for breath
a nurse places an oxygen mask over andrews face and he drinks in the air
his eyes are wide open with fear sweat covering his face
title two weeks later
if he was mediocre why did they gave him this major assignment three weeks before they fired him
they were testing him
grimy windows int
they wanted to see if hed rise to the challenge
an american flag hangs on the wall
they wanted to give him a final chance
id still love to know what happened to that missing file
wouldnt we all
ask the computer
they say he wasnt competent
but you heard him on the stand
he sounded pretty smart to me
why would they fire him
why not a medical leave or
they freaked out over the aids
they hate homosexuals
its not against the law to disapprove of homosexuals
it is against the law to fire someone for having aids
thats why were here
youre the foreman
you havent said anything
what do you think
angle on the marine sitting at the head of the table
theyre saying he wasnt a good lawyer
he was mediocre
and the fact that they gave him the most important lawsuit theyd ever had for one of their most important clients
they say that doesnt prove anything because that was just a test
what did they call it
to see if hed rise to the occasion
say ive got to send a pilot into enemy territory and hes gonna be flying a plane that cost million dollars
who am i going to put into that plane
a rookie who cant cut the grade because i want to see if hell rise to the challenge
or am i going to give that assignment to my best pilot my most experienced my sharpest my top gun
the very best ive got
could somebody please explain that to me
like im a six year old
members of the jury have you reached a verdict
joe is utterly cool
sitting beside andrews empty chair among the spectators andrews siblings jill matt randy and his parents bud and sarah
rachel anthea and miguels sister maria
the marine rises to his feet
we have your honor
charles wheeler looks the marine in the eye
we find for the plaintiff andrew beckett
joe smiles just barely remaining calm
charles wheeler whispers to belinda conine
have you awarded any damages
yes we have your honor
referring to a list for back pay and loss of benefits one hundred fortythree thousand dollars
joe shakes his head disappointed writing down the amount
wheeler and his crew smile this is for damages related to mental anguish and humiliation
we give no award
joe is extremely disappointed
and punitive damages we award
four million eight hundred and eighty two thousand dollars
joe throws his pen over his shoulder
andrews supporters joes colleagues from his office rush forward pounding him on the back
andrews family members hug each other
a hospital int
night carrying two shopping bags from the famous th street deli
joe moves down the corridor looking for a particular room
gillman stands outside a hospital room talking in a low voice to bud and sarah beckett
as joe passes them entering andrews room he hears if he comes out of the hospital this time you mustnt expect him to be like he was before
joe steps into
a hand painted banner is strung over andrews bed victory
opera music plays on a portable cd player
andrew lies in a hospital bed with a pressurized oxygen mask on his face
jill sits on the edge of andrews bed holding his hand smiling speaking to andrew in low tones
with his free hand andrew gently strokes jills forearm
andrew has an amazing assortment of tubes and ivs running into various parts of his body
andrews brothers matt and randy are sipping beers with rev
jim miguel miguels sister maria bruno and chandra while matt does a dramatic re creation of the marine juror rendering the judgment
matts audience is loving it
as joe comes into the room jill rises to take the shopping bags from him
joe exchanges nods and greetings with the others
people keep their voices low but theres a certain energy and happiness evident in the room
on andrew watching his friends and relatives with sparkling eyes and a weak but grateful and peaceful smile
on joe glancing across the room catching andrews look
andrew smiles at joe and pats his hospital bed indicating he wants joe to sit there
joe crosses the room sits on the edge of the bed
with some difficulty andrew removes his oxygen mask
his voice is raspy weak what do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean
a good start
excellent work joe
i thank you
it was good working with you andrew
sees the oxygen mask hey
shouldnt you put that thing back on
andrew begins fitting the mask back in place but his hands are weak
joe helps adjust the straps behind andrews ears
i better get home
lisa and i are having some friends over
muffled by the mask sure thing
ill see you beckett
andrew nods weakly
but hes still smiling and his eyes are dancing
through mask thanks for coming by
well see you later
joe heads for the door meeting miguel there
to miguel hes looking good
i wouldnt be surprised if he gets out of here soon
we just want to get him home
thanks for stopping by joe
miguel puts his arms around joe and hugs him
joe slaps miguels back
miguel begins circulating among the guests saying hes tired
he ought to sleep
saying to a group of doctors and nurses what do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean
the elevator doors close
matt gives andrews hand a squeeze before leaving
see you tomorrow buddy
jim pats andrews shoulder
god bless you andy
bud beckett kisses andrew on the cheek
get some rest okay
sarah beckett is strong kissing andrew on the forehead
goodnight angel my sweet boy
randy beckett loses control of his emotions as he bends to hug his brother
he begins to sob
andrew puts his weak arms with the iv lines connected around his brother randy to comfort him
through mask im okay bro
ill see you tomorrow
jill hugs andrew giving miguel a kiss as she leaves the room
maria waves goodnight from the doorway closing the door
miguel sits on the edge of the bed kicking off his shoes
miguel stretches onto the bed next to andrew picks up the remote control and turns on the tv
andrew pulls aside the oxygen mask to say im ready
ready for what baby
i hope youre ready for studs because thats whats on
andrew replaces the oxygen mask
they lie next to each other watching television
from inside the house the phone rings
lisa is sitting up in bed having answered the phone
joe is just waking up
to joe its miguel
joe sits bolt upright
a taxi arrives and an elegant well dressed older couple step out
on the other side very dignified handsome people who have just arrived from spain
they enter the apartment where
a wake is in progress
lots of food
people sharing stories about andrew
some people laughing
one or two softly crying as they hug each other
someone has set up a memento table with pictures of andrew at various stages of his life and things that meant something to him like programs from the opera a
ballcap photos of his favorite cat etc
theme music plays but we hear bits of dialogue under the music youre miguels parents
do you remember when andy
i went to college with andy
bud beckett sits alone very quiet
miguel leads his parents over to bud
bud looks up rises extending his hand to miguels dad
miguels father shakes his head in sadness reaches for bud and pulls him into his arms for an embrace
camera zeros in on the tv set across the room where black and white images are flickering ignored by everyone
as camera gets closer to the tv it becomes apparent that the images are black and white home movies converted to video
the home movies feature a bright eyed little boy
riding a bike with training wheels
swinging wildly at a wiffle ball
people are still talking still laughing still crying but we cant hear them any longer
we hear only the soundtrack from the home movies
andrew shouting gleefully as he chases a new puppy
andrew squealing as he jumps into a tiny swimming pool
andrew on a swing going higher and higher
may we never find space so vast planets so cold heart and mind so empty that we cannot fill them with love and warmth
