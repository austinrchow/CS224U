href b b sweet smell of sucess by clifford odets ernest lehman working script for a row of newspaper delivery trucks is lined up against the long loading bay waiting
for the edition
in the foreground a large clock establishes the time as pm
a rumbling noise warns the men to take their positions a few seconds later the bales of newspapers come sliding the spiral chutes onto the moving belts from which they
are manhandled onto the trucks
much noise and shouting
the front truck moves out to the city street
as it does camera emphasizes the big poster on its side
the design features a large pair of spectacles with heavy rims a trademark of hunseckers
it will later be seen as the masthead of the gossip column
read they eyes of broadway the truck starts on its journey along broadway
some shots are of the vehicle moving through very heavy traffic taken from a camera car
others are from the inside of the truck as it slows down the delivery man tosses the heavy bundle of papers onto the sidewalk
camera following the truck holds it in foreground against the blazing electric signs of broadway and times square
the southeast corner of the intersection of broadway and th street camera fairly high shoots north towards the impressive vista of electric signs silhouetted against the darkening sky
very heavy traffic and crowded sidewalks
camera descends towards the orange juice stand on the corner passing the booth which sells souvenir hats
it moves through the congestion of chattering passersby steadily approaching a smartly dressed young man who stands at the counter of the orange juice stand
oblivious of the hub bub around him sidney falco is concerned only with his private problems
he turns sharply as a newspaper truck pulls up at the curb behind him this is what he has been waiting for
the news truck delivery man tosses a bundle out onto the sidewalk besides a newsstand
the bundle of newspapers
it hits the sidewalk with a smack
camera pulls back as sidney falco crosses the sidewalk
the owner of the newsstand iggy comes to pick up the bundle he is a grizzled gnome with a philosophical sense of humor sidney snaps his fingers with impatience
iggy wears spectacles and is clearly more or less blind he has to grope for the cord that binds the papers
aw lady if i looked like you id cmon
recognizing sidneys voice keep ya sweatshirt on sidney
majestically taking his time iggy lifts the bundle to his stand and cuts the cord
hey fresh the globe just came in hey sidney want an item for hunseckers column
two rolls get fresh with a baker
hey hot hot hot etc
annoyed sidney throws him a dime seizes a paper and returns briskly to the orange juice stand
sidneys place at the crowded counter has been taken by newcomers
rudely he recovers his half consumed glass of orange juice and sandwich
he takes them further down the counter to a quieter corner at which he can examine the paper
camera moving with him picks up further snatches of overheard dialogue
see dialogue attached at the end of the scene we move close enough to see sidneys hands open the paper expertly at hunseckers column identifiable by the picture of the
over scene there is a babble of offstage dialogue
his face is sullen as his eyes run rapidly down the column
he is reacting to a not unexpected disappointment
camera shoots west on th street as sidney comes down the side street from the newsstand in background
irritably he jerks open the door of a shabby entrance
as the glass door closes sidney is seen striding up the stairs
beside the top of the stairs is the door to sidneys office
on it there is a cheaply printed cardboard sign which reads publicity from inside comes the sound of desultory typing
sidney comes up the stairs two at a time and turns into the door
sally is on the phone as sidney strides in
just a minute mr
sidney vigorously indicates that he doesnt want to take the call
to phone im sorry
i thought that was mr
yes ill tell him when he comes in
i know hes been trying to reach you
she hangs up
thats the third time hes called today
he wants me to break a leg
literally no an arm he said
then i told him you were sure the item would be in mr
hunseckers column in tomorrows
interrupting sharply it isnt
ive just seen the early edition
that makes five days in a row that mr
hunseckers cut you out of his column
may i rent you out as an adding machine
he has begun to change his clothes
get me joe robard
sally goes back into the outer room
who else phoned
the renting agent and the tailor
pay the rent
let the tailor wait
it wont leave much of a balance in the bank
to phone mr
could you locate him
sidney in a state of semi undress comes to take the phone from her
gloomily watch me run a fifty yard dash with my legs cut off
very abruptly he comes alive on the phone
a real laughing boy
effusively sidney joe
how do you like it
im running out of alibis
no i asked hunsecker to withhold the item until he could give it a fine fat paragraph
the column was running over and i didnt want you kissed off with just a line
robard is a stolid secure man balding and with a moustache
he has a morose sense of humor
he is speaking from a telephone on a little desk at the end of the bar
in background the club is open but there are few customers as yet
some recorded jazz is being played while the musicians are still arriving strolling past in background depositing their overcoats and music cases in the little closet assigned to them
in answer to sidney of course
he listens to protest from sidney what is this sidney a kissing game
youre a liar thats a publicity mans nature
i wouldnt hire you if you wasnt a liar
i pay you a c and a half a week wherein you plant big lies about me and the club all over the map
a pause yeah i mean in that sense
but also in the sense that you are a personal liar too because you dont do the work i pay you for
new protests on the other end of the line oh stop it sidney
youre from the country not me
sally is watching him unhappy on his behalf
to phone now wait a minute joe
when i saw j
last night he said
but robard has cut off
sidney hangs up
sally tries to be comforting
i wish i could help in some way sidney
aggressively help me with two minutes of silence
sally hurt says nothing
presently he adds go home sally
i hate to see you like this sidney with another mercurial change of manner begins some sarcastic clowning
horsing around yes but as a new subscriber youre under no obligation to take more than three books
and if you mail the enclosed card within ten days pleadingly sidney i know you by now
dont do a dance with me
still clowning you mean you dont want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world
distressed sidney please dear if you feel nervous
sidney is abruptly savage
with cruelty so whatll you do if i feel nervous
youll open your meaty sympathetic arms
breaking down sid
you got me so
i dont know what
she is crying
sidney feels uncomfortable
not too generously he relents you ought to be used to me by now
pathetically im used to you
with a touch of bitterness no
you think im a hero
im no hero
im nice to people where it pays me to be
i gotta do it too much on the outside so dont expect me to kow tow in my own office
im in a bind right now with hunsecker so grimly every dog has his day
going lock up and leave the key
the phone rings
sidney is dressed by now
as sally goes for it he makes for the outer door
if thats for me tear it up
take a top coat
and leave a tip in every hat check room in town
he is already gone as she picks up the phone
sidney falco office
oh miss kay he tried to reach you
no hes at the barbers now
no thats held over till the tuesday column
as the dissolve clears a clatter of polite applause greets the end of a previous number
camera is on the bandstand moving smoothly through the group of five musicians as the rhythm of a new number is set up first the leader a guitarist snaps his
fingers giving the tempo to
the bass who walks with the beat bringing in
the drums which start a quiet insistent wire brush background for
the cello and the flute whose introductory phrases set the stage for
the guitar the leader again
it comes in after this short preamble with the first statement of melody
the tune has a faint echo of significance because it is one of the themes of the film already heard as a phrase in the background score of the title
camera lingers a moment on the guitarist steve dallas
he is a youth of pleasant intelligent appearance
he plays with the intent air of the contemporary jazz musician who takes his work very seriously indeed and affects a much greater interest in the music and his fellow
musicians than in the listening audience
a close shot
sidney has just entered the club strolling into the vestibule near the entrance
he wears an expression of oddly unsuitable antagonism as he looks forward
seen in long shot from sidneys viewpoint
camera moves to include sidney in foreground again
he turns as he is accosted by rita the cigarette girl of the club
she is a pert creature attractive and not unaware of the fact
dont you ever get messages eyelashes
i called you twice
irked ive been up to here
listen honey tell me something
you know susan hunsecker
rita nods has she been in
i mean lately in the last coupla days
i dont think so
find out for me
with a nod sidney can i talk to you a minute
rita wears an injured air
sidney preoccupied with other worries callously ignores it
is frank dangelo around
at the bar sidney
but sidney has moved away from her
he is at the bar listening with satisfaction to the music watching the performers and studying the audience
sidney comes up behind him
we see sidneys eyes flick from dangelo towards the bandstand and back again
then as he takes the stool next to dangelo he assumes a different manner a sulky resentment
dangelo sees sidney
to the bartender joe give my nephew a drink
sullen your nephew doesnt want a drink
dangelo is still watching the quintet
the guitar can be heard again
shooting past dangelo and sidney towards the bandstand
thats a lollipop that boy
the kid is only great
and with ten percent of his future youre great too frank
dangelo looks quickly at sidney sensing the undercurrent
then he turns his back on the musicians remarking in a quiet tone
went over to philly yesterday an seen the folks
its nice you send them the fifty a month
after a pause see my mother
shaking his head i only had a few hours
a glum moment
frank sips his highball sidney lights a cigarette animosity on his face
thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow
begrudgingly robards my client
i did it for him and his club not your boys
frank again notes sidneys resentful manner
sidney looks towards the musicians
quietly frank i think maybe you lied to me
quietly looka sidney youre my own sisters son but where does that give you the right to call me a liar
looking towards steve you told me that your boy was washed up with susie hunsecker didnt you
yeah and its the truth to the best of my knowledge
and frankly im glad
for steves sake im glad not yours
i manage these boys and i got their best interests at heart
steve shouldnt get mixed up with no bimbo at his age
narrowly you told him that
not in those exact words you know what a temper hes got
sidney is thinking
when do these hot headed boys of yours go on the road
for eight weeks
thats a nice tour
frank nodding when was susie around here last
four five nights ago
thats how i know the romance is off
also steves in a very bad mood
abruptly listen frank youd better make sure youre telling me the truth
annoyed i dont like this threatening attitude
when it comes to it what the heck is it your business what they do this boy and girl
locating sidney she comes up behind him
he turns away from dangelo as she whispers to him
as she departs sidney turns back
if you knew hunsecker as well as i did you might understand why its my business
maybe youre walking around blind frank without a cane
sidney gets off his stool
casually but to effect he adds and in case you didnt know it susie hunseckers out there on the back step right now
he turns away glancing towards steve on the bandstand behind him
he looks disturbed
from dangelos point of view
camera looks up at steve
the quintet is now reaching the end of the number a driving rhythm of considerable excitement
a waiter passes in f
and the camera cranes back through the curtained doorway to the backstage part of the club
this movement is continued as we see some other employees including jerry wiggins the intermission pianist who is waiting in the corridor near the fire exit
as he steps out of the door to discard a cigarette camera again continues its movement craning back and downward into the little courtyard
here it discovers the figure of a young woman who is waiting in the shadow near the steps of the fire escape listening to the music
this is susan hunsecker
she wears an expensive mink coat
it is oddly in contrast with her personality the face is sensitive and intelligent but childlike and tragic
a girl in adolescence already burdened with problems beyond her capacity
over scene the music continues
susan shifts her position knowing that the session will soon be at an end and that the musicians will be coming backstage
steve is playing the last bars of the number the whole group now in unison
the music comes sharply dramatically to its finish
there is some applause
the boys relax
steve reaches for the microphone and in the characteristically casual manner of the cool musician announces the end of the set thanking the audience identifying the quintet by name and
introducing the intermission pianist
during this carson chico and paul wander off the bandstand behind him
chico paul and carson come through to the corridor backstage
as they do so chico glancing out of the open door sees susan in the courtyard
he goes out onto the fire escape paul following behind
to paul throw a rope round this chick while i go get steve
chico goes swiftly back into the club
paul remains with susan
there is a momentary silence paul is embarrassed because susan is
susan makes an effort at conversation she nods towards the club
packin em in
steve has been trapped by a young woman in spectacles a much too earnest devotee of progressive jazz
im terribly interested in jazz serious jazz
you studied with milhaud didnt you
this is such an interesting fusion of the traditional classical form with the new progressive style i just wanted to ask you how you came to form the group
he comes through the curtains of the doorway pausing as he sees that steve is involved with the intellectual young woman
steve glancing at chico over the shoulder of the intellectual young woman
seeing that chico has something to say to him he wriggles out of the young womans clutches by passing the buck to the unfortunate to fred katz who is descending
from the bandstand behind him
well we just sort of got together
turning to introduce fred maybe if you ask mr
he writes the stuff you know
steve joins chico and they go through the curtains into the corridor outside
chico smiling explains dont waste your time there man
youve got something better waiting outside
as steve looks at him susies out there
his reaction betrays some emotion
over scene the intermission pianist has begun to play a blues number
steve moves a quick step towards the door to the courtyard then hesitates almost as if he was afraid to go out
he meets chicos eye again
what did she say
he is amused but sympathetic
you proposed to her not me
slapping him on the back go get your answer
susan waiting at the foot of the iron steps turns as steve comes out on the fire escape above
steve comes quickly down the steps towards her slowing down when he gets a few paces away from her
she looks up at steve
a close shot
in his expression we read his mute inquiry
quite deliberately with her eyes moistened by love and affection
great relief and happiness can be seen in the boys face
after a moment he moves to her and she to him
they embrace swiftly hold each other close and then kiss with passion
presently when the kiss is over susan speaks softly
in a whisper steve
ill try to make a good wife
steve is still too choked with relief to speak
for answer he clasps her more tightly to him
the beam of light which falls on the iron stairs behind them narrows and then is extinguished
paul has closed the door
turning he shares a look with the grinning chico and fred katz who has managed to escape from the young woman
before there is time for either of them to make a remark sidney comes through the curtains from the club
wheres the chief
sidneys manner is very friendly
but it is immediately apparent from the reaction of the other three boys that none of them likes sidney
fred is deliberately uncomprehending
who gets the point dallas
is he around
chicos back is to the closed door which opens onto the courtyard
chico nods in the opposite direction towards the stairs
unhelpfully yeah hes around somewhere
coldly as he goes thanks
steve and susan are still embracing
steve is exultantly proud and happy
incoherent this is big you know
lets go out later drink some firewater
with the boys
fred can call millie and steve id rather you didnt say anything for a day or two
until i tell my brother
his sobering reaction shows this is something important
gently you havent told him yet
im telling him in the morning after breakfast
turning her head she makes a little gesture an unconscious movement putting her fingers to her brow as if feeling a headache
he isnt going to like it
susan says nothing
she looks to steve smiling but the smile is not too confident
you sure you dont want me to be with you
susan stoutly shakes her head
defensively she reassures steve steve my brother isnt as bad as hes painted
he isnt perfect but but he isnt going to like this susie
and he makes you nervous not me
no i take that back he makes me nervous too
but i wouldnt give him a second thought if not for you
the topic evidently makes susan uneasy
in an effort to dismiss something that she does not want to think about susan puts her arms around steves neck again
lets forget him and but steve is not so ready to change the subject
his stooge falco is around i saw him walk in
soberly hes been spying on me for weeks susie
quickly perhaps too quickly darling i dont care really i dont
sidneyd had a secret crush on me for years but nothing we do is his business gently insisting but he could be reporting back to your brother couldnt he
pleading steve dear please forget all of this
what can it matter after tomorrow
now steve responds
he grins holds her closer
softly i have a message for you i love you
kissing her lightly may i dedicate the next number to you
and the next and the next
every sunday ill buy you a new bonnet amused but moved if the stores are open and on monday ill take it off and stroke your light brown hair and
and on tuesday hasenpfeffer
abruptly grinning how do you think i realized i love you
i made you write a beautiful song
no you had me eating that chinese food
they laugh and enjoyably but then as the camera moves we realize that sidney is there on the fire escape above them his manner is affable
can more than two enjoy this joke
to susan hello susie i didnt expect to find you here
steve says nothing
but he obviously resents the intrusion and finds it difficult to conceal the fact
sidney comes down the fire escape towards them
wheres those glossy prints you promised
tonights the latest i can place them barely polite well thanks anyway lets forget it
to susan its cold out here susie
steve makes a move to lead susan back inside
it is a gesture which appears to dismiss sidney
sidney chooses to take umbrage lightly sarcastic let me apologize for getting you that press spread
its been an honor to serve you gratis
steve turns to sidney his manner is quiet but challenging levelly i get the feeling falco that youre always snooping around
quickly intervening steve stop it please
frank dangelo has followed sidney out onto the fire escape other members of the quintet have also appeared
what are you boys fighting about
aggressively indignant sidney throws up his hands he knocks on the metal of the fire escape
sarcastic kill me
find me a door somewhere i walked in without knocking
sidney is trying to needle steve steves temper would normally have exploded but now he controls it
im feeling too good to fight with you but that isnt what i said i said you snoop
for instance what were you doing around my hotel the other night
needling begging your pardon i havent been down the bowery in years
soothingly come on boys break it up
overriding dangelo the next time you want information falco dont scratch for it like a dog ask for it like a man
his face tightens he appears to be mortally insulted and controlling himself with difficulty
he turns his back swiftly on steve addressing susan in a voice that has a sharp edge
if youre going home susie ill drop you off
sidney starts quickly up the fire escape
this makes steve angry and he steps forward to follow him
but chico contrives without seeming to interfere to obstruct steve
easily time for the next set chief
just a minute chico
sidney comes inside
when he is out of sight or the group in the courtyard his manner swiftly changes
its obvious now that his indignation was assumed now he looks back towards the courtyard and there is shrewdness in his eyes he is assessing steves temper
but presently seeing dangelo and the boys returning he moves back to the curtains into the club
as dangelo and the other boys go inside steve turns back to susan
fondly just so you dont leave me in a minor key
rita has succeeded in recapturing sidney near the entrance to the club
sidney alert and interested listens to her while keeping his eye on the bandstand in b
where the intermission pianist is finishing his performance and the quintet are returning ready to mount the bandstand again
dont tell me you started a polka with leo bartha
shaking her head no
thats what i mean im being fired for what i didnt do
sidney is amused
rita continues in a confidential manner which is heavily loaded with sex appeal and not very convincing air of injury
soto voce he came in last week on a very dull rainy night
i know who he was but i didnt let on
emphatically he didnt take his eyes off me all night
rita has mistaken sidneys shrewdly calculating expression for inattention
he was staring
consequently when he approached me on his way out i wasnt surprised but i didnt let on
prompting he was writing a special sunday piece on
nodding cigarette girls
and naturally you were thrilled to be interviewed
she nods were you interviewed
in his apartment and where was his wife
i dont know its a big apartment
but i wasnt interviewed
in fact i was totally unprepared for what happened
grimacing were old friends chickie quit it
a big columnist comes in this room without his ball and chain and you make like a delicatessen counter
what did you think would happen in his house
with a nod but sidney darling the man must be out of his mind it was only eleven oclock in the morning
despite himself sidney chuckles but she is distressed
for a moment i was so taken aback that i said anything that popped into my sleepy head
if im not mistaken i even ordered the man out of his own house
sidneys eyes have been caught by something at the other end of the big room
from sidneys viewpoint
susan has come back into the club with steve and seems to be taking leave of him
she starts to walk through the club on her way out
sidney with half his attention on susan and steve listens to ritas rueful protest
rapidly he was furious and by the time i could have put on a tropical island mood i was out on the street
dolefully that night mr
van cleve calls me into his office here
hes got nothing against me he says but he cant afford to antagonize columnists
i told him i still have sonny at military academy but van cleves made of ice
aware that sidney is moving to leave her so that he can catch susan rita detains him with an appeal tentative do you think you could do something sidney
a quick nod thats what im thinking rita
rita is anxious to cement the offer
delicately she asks do you still keep your key under the mat
eyeing her can you be there by two thirty
she drops her eyes nods
sidney pats her arm and is gone
she looks after him
sidney overtakes susan at the front entrance in time to open the door for her
he has now reverted to another mood in which he appears to be sulking over the insult delivered to him by steve
he goes out ahead of her
the quintet are resuming their positions on the stand
steve lingers a moment his guitar already in his hand while he talks to dangelo
frank i dont want any secrets from you
i proposed to susie tonight
dangelo hides his feelings asks did she accept
you dont like it do you
i think she will accept but im not sure
she may be too dependent on her brother
he mounts the bandstand
solemnly lots of good people in this town are dependent on her brother
steve sits on the stool quietly gives the beat to his group and begins at once the guitar opening of a very simple and lonely melody
while dangelo watches him the boy continues
camera tracks slowly back through the club as the chatter and babble of the customers begins to diminish in appreciation of the quiet melancholy of the music
susan is standing beside the poster which features steve listening to the music from inside the club
sidney comes to join her
he is now pretending to be hurt
youre touchy sidney dont be so touchy
gruffly i wasnt looking for a brawl
i came to bring him a present
then wanna bite to eat
susan shakes her head
she looks up as she hears the doormans whistle off screen
sidney moves forward to escort her to the taxi
they cross the sidewalk and get into the cab
it starts off and camera pans with it
susan is relaxed content but thoughtful
sidney flicks her a quick anxious look
finally gloomily feels like a monday night dont it
softly not to me
sometimes the world feels like a cage
then someone comes along and opens the door
and its never monday night again
turning to sidney i wish you and steve could like each other
grimacing we stick in each others craw
yes but why
well for one thing he thinks j
is some kind of monster
quizzically she studies sidney
he looks up sharply he is momentarily startled at susans insight
swiftly he assumes a protesting air
susie your brothers one of my best friends and she is not totally convinced by this performance
she smiles skeptically
but someday id like to look into your clever mind and see what you really think of him sidney makes a show of indignation
where do you come off to make a remark like that
quietly who could love a man who keeps jumping through burning hoops like a trained poodle
sidney doesnt immediately answer
susan drops her eyes becoming absorbed in her own problems
cautiously sidney lets the momentary silence continue
then thoughtfully do you think j
glibly frankly yes to my surprise
he thinks hes very gifted those boysll go a big mile he thinks
susan says nothing
sidney watching her closely probes further gently you feel pretty strong about this boy
then susan nods
she is not looking at sidney and cannot see the watchfulness in his face
sidney prompts again wedding bells you mean
again susan nods
he wants me to go on the road with them
its an eight month tour all the way to oregon
the news has considerable impact on him
but he hides it saying lightly well congratulations
but dont go just for the ride
or didnt you accept the proposal
im going to discuss it with j
in the morning
each is concerned with private thoughts
susan relaxed adds quietly softly its given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself not just because im my brothers sister
chickie ill have to laugh at that an attractive girl like you
susan ignores his remark continuing thoughtfully i hope that j
really likes steve that it isnt an act
with an indignant edge why should he put on an act
your brother has told presidents where to go and what to do
the taxi has pulled to a stop
susan sits for a moment before she remarks
the act would be for my sake not steves
realizing that they have come to their destination susan gets up moving out of camera as she disembarks from the taxi
camera catches a glimpse of apprehension in sidneys eyes
quickly he decides to follow her
susan getting out of the taxi moves past camera
sidney following her instructs the driver
to cabbie wait for me
ill be right back
sidney moves after the girl calling susie
hearing him susan turns back
sidney walks into shot to join her
lightly its not my nature susie but ill talk to you like an uncle
smiling but i dont need an uncle sidney
they move through the doors
sidney quickly corrects himself saying earnestly no i mean because i admire you in fact more than admire you although thats neither here nor there
quickly skipping to the important point susie dont sell your brother short
talk this over with him i mean youll find him a real friend
susan looks thoughtful making no comment
carefully again probing he prompts her any message in case i see j
susan turns away and walks out past camera
sidney watches her
she looks back at sidney quietly firm
tell him for me that steve dallas is the first real man ive ever been in love with
she turns away and walks through the inner door going down the corridor towards the elevators in background
the sincerity of the girls manner strikes home to sidney
now that her back is turned we see the sharp twinge of pain with which he hears the statement of her feelings for another man
angered he wheels striding out of the door onto broadway
sidney returns to the cab instructing the driver the twenty one club
he climbs in and the taxi drives off down broadway
camera high shooting west down nd street as sidneys cab pulls up double parking in front of the club
sidney maneuvers his way between the parked cars towards the entrance and the camera descends to shoot along the courtyard towards the entrance
we see the figure of jimmy weldon and his girl friend coming out of the club
jimmy weldon is coming out of the club accompanied by a girl he is slightly tight
as he steps through the outer doors weldon again spies sidney on the sidewalk he steps to one side of the entrance way
sidney slips through the congestion but just as he tries to enter the club weldons hand shoots out neatly ambushing him pulling him aside into the narrow courtyard
sidney is instantly resentful of this manhandling but has to adjust himself assuming a quick smile for the benefit of weldon
this is a coincidence
i am just going overlapping yeah
a coincidence you should run into the very man youve been ducking all week
to the girl this is my press agent joan
weldon jibing at sidney plays his remarks off the girl who is amused sidney of course is not
quickly i tried to reach you twice overlapping what do you do for that hundred a week
fall out of bed
jimmy im on my way inside right now to talk to hunsecker
i can promise you horsing joan call a cop
well arrest this kid for larceny
sidney flinches his pride touched
listen when your band was playing at roseland cutting in that was two months ago
take your hand out of my pocket thief
the girl tries to quiet weldon who has gone from horsing to loud contempt
take it easy jimmy dear
its a dirty job but i pay clean money for it dont i
abruptly sidney bursts out giving as good as he has taken no more you dont
what is this youre showing off for her
theyre supposed to hear you in korea
smirking to the girl hes intuitive he knows hes getting fired
if youre funny james im a pretzel
weldon shepherded by the girl is already on his way across the sidewalk
it was nice knowing you sidney
not cheap but nice
happy unemployment insurance
sidney entering the club threads his way through the crowded foyer coming up to camera near the foot of the staircase
there he meets a captain who turns to him
how are you tonight mr
nodding towards the restaurant is he inside
but of course
alone or surrounded
a senator an agent and something with long red hair
sidney moves past camera coming a couple of paces towards the door to the restaurant
from sidneys viewpoint
shooting through the doorway into the restaurant we can see the group at the table
hunseckers back is turned to us
camera pulls back to include sidney in foreground
he decides not to go into restaurant and turns away out of shot
sidney comes round the corner from the foyer and walks through the lounge to the door into the alcove where the phone booths are camera panning
sidney moves briskly past the girl at the switchboard instructing her honey get me mr
the girl reaches for a book of phone numbers then remembers hes right inside mr
from inside the booth so it isnt long distance
as the girl shrugging puts through the call camera moves closer to sidney in the booth
he hears the connection made speaks at once
to phone j
its me we are close enough to the instrument to hear the sound of a voice on the other end
though the words are not distinguishable it is quite clear that the speaker is not talking to the phone
sidney seems to relax as if this is something that happens often
he waits studying his manicured fingertips
presently sidney hears the voice on the other end become clearer
it asks yes
camera moves closer as sidney says j
can you come outside for one minute
hunseckers voice filtered through the sound of the telephone is sharp and tiny but the words are now very clear
can i come out
tensely i have to talk to you alone j
you had something to do for me you didnt do it
can i come in for a minute
youre dead son get yourself buried
there is a click as hunsecker hangs up
sidney more slowly also hangs up
brooding he comes out of the booth
sidney comes out of the door to the phone booths walks through the lounge to the hallway
he turns towards the dining room
sidney comes to the door into the dining room camera tracking with him
here he pauses looking towards
from sidneys viewpoint
hunsecker is seated at a table which is cleverly his habitual position
we see him only in semi back view a broad and powerful back
he is listening to a man who has paused at his table stooping over hunsecker to whisper in his ear
as the columnist listens his hands play with an omni present pad and pencil which lie on the dinner table amongst an assortment of envelopes mimeographed sheets and a telephone
beyond hunsecker and the man talking to him are the senator the agent and an attractive if fatuous girl
ill check it in the morning low thanks
the man leaves hunsecker is scribbling a note on the pad
meanwhile the senator whispers something to the girl who giggles softly
sidney comes across to the table nervous but deliberate
camera pulls back to include hunsecker in foreground
sidney without accosting him stands a few feet from the columnists elbow and deliberately lights a cigarette
hunsecker barely turning his head sees him
we have heard of hunsecker as a monster but he is evidently in a mild phase of his metabolism for he seems gentle sad and quiet as he turns his
gaze casually to the senator totally ignoring the young man who stands behind him
softly harvey i often wish i were dead and wore a hearing aid
with a simple flick of a switch i could shut out the greedy murmur of little men
a close shot
sidney shows no reaction to this insult
he steps in closer an indian fixity in his face
i need your ear for two minutes
shooting across sidney onto hunsecker
turns but not to sidney
he raises his hand in a small gesture which summons a passing captain who steps into picture at sidneys elbow
i dont want this man at my table
quickly but quietly interrupting i have a message from your sister
the captain is already there
but now hunseckers eyes have switched to sidneys face
for the briefest of moments nothing happens
then hunsecker seeming to relax and ignoring the captain whom he has summoned turns back to casual conversation with the senator as if nothing had happened
forgive me harvey
we were interrupted before in foreground sidney turns to the captain with a carved smile indicating that hunseckers change of topic is to be interpreted as sanction for sidney to
the captain not entirely convinced retreats
sidney finds himself a chair places it and takes a seat which is near enough to the table to establish his presence
during this who is mildly surprised and faintly embarrassed err
the supreme court story i was telling you justice black
nodding yes the justice thats right
but i think you had it in the column
smoothly casually last july the lead item
sidneys interjection is quietly well mannered
hunsecker totally ignores it
the other members of the party are a little astonished at the interplay
the girl in particular is fascinated she clearly admires sidneys looks
the senator noting this glances at sidney accepting the point laughing and i believe thats precisely where i read it too
you see j
where i get my reputation for being the best informed man in washington
now dont kid a kidder
the girl looks again towards sidney
the senator again sees this addresses sidney pleasantly
i dont think we caught your name young man
the senator in foreground sidney beyond hunsecker in background and the others on edge of shot
sidney falco sir
and of course everyone knows and admires you senator walker
humorously every four years i get less convinced of that
this young lady is miss linda james
indicates the girl shes managed by manny davis
he indicates the agent sidney nods pleasantly to the girl and the agent
i know manny davis
quietly everyone knows manny davis
as the phone rings on the table except mrs
hunsecker is picking up the phone continuing yes
go ahead billy shoot
to intercut with the above
the senator the agent and the girl watching hunsecker
the agents reaction to hunseckers remark is a sickly smile
he repeats aloud a story which is told him over the telephone
sports cars in california are getting smaller and smaller
the other day you were crossing hollywood boulevard and you were hit by one
you had to go to the hospital and have it removed
coolly youre not following the column i had it last week
during the speech camera eases back to include sidney again
at the end sidney looks up in the direction of the senator
do you believe in capital punishment senator
the senator amused asks why
sidney glances sidelong at hunsecker
pointing to the phone a man has just been sentenced to death
hunseckers face hardens aware of sidneys impertinence he does not design to react directly he turns towards the agent
manny what exactly are the unseen gifts of this lovely young thing that you manage
the agent glances uneasily at the girl beside him
well she sings a little
you know sings
by rote mannys faith in me is simply awe inspiring mr
actually im still studying but he studies the girl intently
singing of course
straight concert and hunseckers glance flicks between the girl and the senator
why of course
it might for instance be politics
as the girl betrays herself with a nervous glance at the senator beside her camera eases back to include him
the senator is unruffled gravely he lights a cigar
the girl laughs
i mean i
are you kidding mr
with my jersey city brains
again his glance links the girl and the senator
the brains may be jersey city but the clothes are trainor norell
the girl and the agent are both nervously uneasy
the senator closely examines the tip of his cigar and with deliberation turns towards sidney
are you an actor mr
supporting the change of subject thats what i was thinking
are you mr
hunsecker for the first time half turns in sidneys direction amused
how did you guess it miss james
they all look at sidney
hes so pretty thats how
sidney bitterly resents the adjective but contrives to hide the fact he smiles gracefully accepting the compliment
hunsecker who knows what sidney feels is pleased he turns towards sidney expansively
falco let it be said at once is a man of forty faces not one none too pretty and all deceptive
see that grin
its the charming street urchins face
its part of his helpless act he throws himself on your mercy
i skip the pleading nervous bit that sometimes blends over into bluster
the moist grateful eye is a favorite face with him it frequently ties in with the act of boyish candor hes talking straight from the heart get it
hes got about half a dozen faces for the ladies but the real cut one to me is the quick dependable chap nothing he wont do for you in a
at least so he says
falco whom i did not invite to sit at this table is about to show in his last and most pitiful role pale face with tongue hanging out
in brief gentlemen and jersey lilly the boy sitting with us is a hungry press agent and fully up to all the tricks of his very slimy trade
hunsecker has started his speech lightly but it has built up to enough cold contempt and feeling to embarrass and intimidate the others at the table
in conclusion hunsecker his eyes on sidney picks up a cigarette and waits expectantly
quietly match me sidney
coolly not just this minute j
amused hunsecker lights his own cigarette turns towards a man who comes up to the table
a single close up to intercut with the above
a matching single sidneys reaction to hunsecker and to the others at the table
to intercut with the above their reactions of embarrassment
a florid man comes up to the table obviously anxious to catch hunseckers attention
hunsecker in the act of lighting his own cigarette scarcely looks at the man as he dismisses him i know that loafer of yours opens at the latin quarter next
more sharply say goodbye lester
the florid man retreats
to cover the embarrassment the senator makes a sally in sidneys direction
may i ask a naive question mr
exactly how does a press agent work
sidney doesnt answer
why dont you answer the man sidalee
hes trying to take you off the hook
to the senator you just had a good example of it
a press agent eats a columnists dirt and is expected to call it manna
hunsecker glances spitefully at the girl
the senator continues to sidney but dont you help columnists by furnishing them with items
sidney leans forward indicating to the senator some of the items of paper that litter the table in front of hunsecker these are both handwritten notes and mimeograph sheets scraps
of assorted items from professional and amateur agents who supply the columnist
sidney fingers some of them
sure columnists cant get along without us
only our good and great friend j
forgets to mention that
we furnish him with items sidney lifts a mimeographed sheet as an example
what some cheap gruesome gags
to hunsecker now you print them dont you
yes with your clients names attached
thats the only reason those poor slobs pay you to see their names in my column all over the world
now as i make it out youre doing me a favor
i didnt say that j
the day that i cant get along without press agents handouts ill close up shop lock stock and barrel and move to alaska
the agent makes the mistake of trying to agree with hunsecker
nodding sweep out my igloo here i come
camera pulls back as hunsecker leans forward across the table
he vents upon the unfortunate agent some of the annoyance prompted by sidneys impertinence
to the agent look manny you rode in here on the senators shirt tails so shut your mouth
the senator doesnt like this treatment of others and his manner and face show it
slowly now come j
thats a little too harsh
anyone seems fair game for you tonight
not as harsh but this man is not for you harvey and you shouldnt be seen with him in public
because thats another part of a press agents life he digs up scandal among prominent men and shovels it thin among the columnists who give him space
he finds hunseckers manner disturbing but addresses him frontally
there is some allusion here that escapes me
an edge of threat were friends harvey we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid congressman dont we
why does everything you say sound like a threat
he leans back speaking more quietly enjoying himself
maybe its a mannerism because i dont threaten friends harvey
but why furnish your enemies with ammunition
youre a family man
someday with god willing you may wanna be president
now here you are harvey out in the open where any hep person knows that this one
hunsecker leans into shot pointing directly at the agent
continuing is toting that one
hunsecker points to the girl and the camera makes a slight crab movement to include the girl as hunsecker points in turn to her
continuing around for you
another camera movement
now hunsecker is directly challenging the senator
he smiles disarmingly
continuing are we kids or what
as hunsecker stands up sidney follows suit
the agent very nervous gets to his feet and the girl does likewise
the senator whose face is sober also rises from the table
to the senator affably next time you come up you might join me at my tv show
with sidney making way for him hunsecker walks round the end of the table to the senator
the senator faces hunsecker solemnly
quietly and cautiously thank you j
for what i consider sound advice
hunsecker matches the senators solemnity
deadpan go thou and sin no more
hunsecker moves out of shot
sidney murmurs a pleased to meet you to the senator then he follows hunsecker
the senator remains looking after hunsecker
behind him the agent and the girl watch him apprehensively
the senator his face now showing the traces of guilt which he did not reveal to hunsecker seems unwilling to turn back to face them
hunsecker and sidney
hunsecker addresses the captain on his way out of the restaurant
mac dont let the senator pay that check
ill take care of it mr
camera tracks with hunsecker and sidney as they move out towards the hat check stand
my big toe would make a better president
by now they are at the coatroom hunsecker smiling
hunseckers coat joe
find me a good one joe
he accepts the proferred coat as he moves past camera
the doorman on the sidewalk has noticed hunsecker almost before the columnist has appeared
the doorman wheels snapping his fingers and signaling towards the car park attendant who can be seen at some distance in the background under the lights of the kinney car
the attendant is seen to react with alacrity running into the park
putting on his overcoat he addresses another of the captains who has escorted him out of the club
dan anyone calls tell em ill be at the morocco maybe the embers
very good mr
sidney catches up with hunsecker as he moves out onto the sidewalk
wheres your coat sidalee
sidney thinks of an impertinent reply decides not to be drawn and says nothing
to sidney my curiosity is killing me what are you so rambunctious about tonight
sidney again does not answer this time he points across the street
theres your fat friend
the car is framed in foreground we can read the sign police attached to the visor
two men in plain clothes detectives are in the front seats
the man nearest is harry kello
wanting to look like a prosperous business man kello looks soft fat mild and well barbered but he is dangerous he knows it and enjoys it
with big shots he is playful and kidding always says just enough not too much
he is very relaxed and mild in manner but underneath there is not only an animal energy but a feral pressing at you
his voice is on the hoarse side
he measures situations automatically and instantly
the police radio is chattering
also in evidence is the telephone the radio link with headquarters
the detective at the wheel nudges kello pointing across the street
kello gets out of the car and moves to meet the columnist
as he approaches hello harry
cheerfully bonna sera commendatore
sidney follows a couple of paces behind hunsecker he is in no hurry to meet the detective whom he clearly dislikes
turning to sidney you see sidalee that shows that lt
kello likes your people
kello offers his hand to hunsecker
its my brooklyn background j
im good on yiddish too
hunsecker accepting the handshake winces with pretended pain at what is clearly an over enthusiastic grip
harry am i supposed to say uncle
kello laughs releases the grip hunsecker strolls past him stoops to lean into the car listening to the police calls on the radio
anything fit to print tonight
to the policeman in the car hello phil
howre the kids
the detective inside the car answers respectfully
any news fit to print tonight
joining hunsecker i just checked downtown
quiet everywhere tonight
incidentally what happened to that doll
you gave me the item last night
still hanging on
but they still dont know if she was pushed
she mighta jumped
to the policeman in the car check it for me phil
its a real heart throb
while phil lifts the radio phone calling headquarters hunsecker turns back to kello and sidney
mischievously hunsecker nods at sidney
to kello say hello to sidney falco
tickle him hes been a bad boy tonight
he called you my fat friend
mildly i dont believe it
instantly aware that j
is toying with sidney kello offers his large hand to sidney who refuses it
i know youre the strongest cop in town
with a laugh i call him the boy with the ice cream face
laughing say thats good its nice in fact its apt harry
modestly yeah i got eyes
i put things together
i remember once when you didnt quite put things together
was the mayor mad
the memory of something unpleasant clouds kellos face
i didnt mean to hit the boy that hard
yeah thats when a feller needed a friend and i wont forget his initials j
the policeman in the car sticks his head out of the window
to hunsecker she died twenty minutes ago mr
theyre still investigating
shaking his head with total dismissal thats show business
to kello see you
kello gets into the police car
as he does so hasta la vista j
the car moves off eastward
sidney and hunsecker walk westward
sidney falling into step with hunsecker glances back at the departing police car
that must show he likes spigs too
i like harry but i cant deny he sweats a little
camera now shoots down nd street
hunsecker back to camera studies the evening hearing the sound of a screech of female laughter from one of the groups in the distance
a drunk is being thrown out of one of the strip tease joints
i love this dirty town
amused hunsecker turns back he signals across the street to the car park indicating that the big black lincoln continental should follow as he strolls with sidney
after a pause conjugate me a verb sidney
for instance to promise
camera tracks with them in a close two shot
sidney is alert now
continuing you told me youd break up that romance when
hesitantly you want something done j
but i doubt if you yourself know whats involved
soft and sardonic im a schoolboy teach me teach me
carefully why not break it up yourself
you could do it in two minutes flat
hunsecker pauses halts
harshly at this late date you need explanations
susies all i got now that shes growing up i want my relationship with her to stay at least at par
i dont intend to antagonize her if i dont have to
starting to walk again now be warned son ill have to blitz you
sidney follows quickly
i dont think you got the cards to blitz me
correct me if im wrong but i dont think so
turning to eye him ill listen one more minute
sidney steps in front of hunsecker blocking his way for a moment
very rapidly about a year ago you asked me to do a favor
it was a thing well i never did a thing that dirty in all my life
hunsecker totally disinterested in sidneys problems of conscience signals to his car again walks past sidney who continues rapidly awright that brings us up to five weeks ago
sidney i got a nasty little problem here
did i say no
im frank to admit it dont jell as fast as we like
but all of a sudden i cant get you on the phone no more
and why as of this date am i frozen out of the column
scornfully are you finished
quickly no lemme finish
i dont like this job
that boy is dumb only on matinee days otherwise hes got a head
and susan like you said shes growing up
what i mean we got a slippery dangerous problem here
incisively not we sidney you
gamely correct me if im wrong we
because when im out on this very slippery limb for you you have to know whats involved
my right hand hasnt seen my left hand for thirty years
sidney quickly moves into j
s path desperate to hold his attention
ill do it j
dont get me wrong in for a penny in for a pound
ill see it through but stop beating me around the head
let me make a living
his mouth tight and mean what you promised do it
dont finagle around
its later than you think
hunsecker walks past sidney now making for the car at which the attendant still waits
as hunsecker passes him excuse it but its later than you think
that boy proposed tonight
hunsecker is hit he stops in his stride he pauses and he turns slowly to look at sidney
lowering he hesitates mind clicking
susie told you that
sidney his eyes bright nods
hunsecker studies sidney then no wonder youve been so feisty tonight
quietly can you deliver
before you go to bed
the cat is in the bag and the bag is in the river
expressionless he examines sidney
then he walks off toward the car
he tips the attendant who thanks him but instead of getting into the back of the car he makes a small authoritative gesture to nikko double to move over so
that hunsecker himself may drive
while nikko does so hunsecker turns back to sidney whom the camera now includes
quietly dont be a two time loser sidalee
the sentence could be severe
he is satisfied
hunsecker gets into the drivers seat beside nikko the japanese houseboy
camera is close on hunsecker who does not look back but is clearly aware of the position of sidney as he puts the car into gear revving the engine
the big car accelerates with impressive power
in doing so it sends a cloud of fumes and a swirl of dust in sidneys direction
he leaps out of the way too late
camera moves closer to him as with anger and ignominy he inspects his precious clothing for damage
but as he looks after the car his face hardens into grim humor he senses that this petty gesture from hunsecker is an indication of his vulnerability not his strength
as dusting his coat sidney walks away camera rises watching his jaunty figure cross the street in the direction of st street
a long shot looking over the round bar towards the entrance
sidney comes in through the revolving doors and comes toward camera
his eyes search among the crowd
a captain approaches sidney
shaking his head just hopping tonight
leo bartha been in
yeah having supper with the mrs
shes over there
the captain nods towards a booth on the other side of the bar where mrs
bartha is sitting alone
seeing that bartha is not with her the captain looks around the bar
interrupting thanks i see him
sidney is looking back towards the entrance hall where
bartha comes forward from the mens room passing the captain and sidney
sidney moves to intercept him
how goes that sunday piece on cigarette girls
a close shot on bartha as he turns towards sidney stopping
cautiously who told you about it
sidney smiles at bartha but the threat is clear
the cigarettes girl
and she took out all her hairpins too
he throws a quick glance at his wife in the booth in background
camera pulls back as sidney who has noted the look moves closer to bartha
i never had the pleasure of meeting your wife
you know what i wonder leo
could you use a hot little item for tomorrows column
sidney is pulling out of his pocket a pad on which to scribble the item
but bartha faces him squarely speaking sotto voce but with emphasis what is this blackmail
bartha turns on his heel and turns to walk towards his wife beyond
sidneys face tightens
after a pause he makes a decision and walks towards the booth
barthas wife is reading a tabloid and sipping champagne while her husband resumes eating a sandwich
these two are antagonists in a long war
sidney comes up to the table repeats leo ive never had the pleasure of meeting your wife
bartha looks up
what can he do
chatty how do you do mr
if you know anything about horses sit a minute
help yourself to a glass of this n
state champagne thats what my husband buys me
bartha pushes the champagne bottle in sidneys direction as sidney sits pleasantly bartha concentrates on his sandwich
all the imported wines arent what theyre cracked up to be
whose side are you on mr
falco his or mine
bartha im a neutral observer for the united nations
bartha laughs enjoying his deftness then whats your first name
over scene sidney
bartha turns to concentrate on the names in the racing column of the tabloid
searching the column no horse running tomorrow by that name
an angle favoring bartha and sidney
bartha glowers at his wife resenting the fact that she has permitted sidney to join them
you ought to stop this nonsense loretta these two dollar bets
cheerfully its compensation leo for the marginal life we lead
to sidney sidney did you hear the story about the cloak and suitor who
sharply interrupting thats right
tell him so i can read it in hunseckers column first
to sidney brightly oh are you a spy for the other side
no i actually sat down to give leo an item
produces his pad again begins to write on it
leo he wants to give you an item dont be sullen
bartha notes sidneys writing
to his wife will you mind your own business
she returns to her paper ignoring them sidney finishes scribbling the item
just in case youd like to print it leo
its a blind no names mentioned
but for your private information the guys name is dallas
he pushes the item to bartha who reads it briefly
meanwhile concentrating on the tabloid there isnt a single name here that gives off vibrations
bartha pushes the item back towards sidney
sidney glances quickly at barthas stony face then significantly turns towards his wife
anything there with a name like cigarette girl
bartha raises his head looks squarely at sidney with contempt and anger
his wife is unaware of this reaction
still looking at the paper she murmurs mmmmmm
no no horse with a name like that
sidney pushes the item back towards bartha
barthas attention is attracted by sidneys gesture
she looks up made aware of this strange by play
a close two shot
sidney waits bartha is white lipped but pushes the item back again i dont print blind items
she looks from sidney to her husband and back
what is this chess or checkers
the three shot favoring bartha and sidney
both sidney and bartha are now aware of mrs
pointedly neither does hunsecker
fractional pause he likes to use the real names
a moment of chill silence
then bartha gets to his feet signals for a waiter
as sidney rises also where are we running
what am i missing here
waiter the check
to wife this man is trying to hold a gun to my head
abruptly thats the horse
shotgun shotgun in the fifth
she quickly studies her newspaper again
as quickly bartha leans across the table and snatches it out of her hands
in doing so he upsets the glass of champagne which contains only a few drops
bartha turns challengingly to sidney
sternly what do you want to tell my wife sidney
she is brushing her lap with her napkin
indignantly he wants to tell me that you poured champagne all over my lap
bartha ignores her again challenges sidney
go on tell her im waiting
flustered what are you talking about
are you nuts or what
the waiter arrives in picture beside them puts the check on the table and goes
bartha picks it up
still mopping her dress with her napkin she waits for her husband to speak
he glances unhappily at his wife
lorry i cant let this man blackmail me
a three shot favoring mrs
bartha her husband and sidney in foreground
sidney decides to retreat
he turns starts to go
but bartha blocks his way holding sidney and explaining to the wife
he wants me to print a dirty smear item for keeping his mouth shut a momentarily pause
then about what
he is uneasy ashamed of himself
foolishly lorry and i hope youll understand
this cigarette girl
i was kidding around with her
this girl i mean
i was kidding around and she took it seriously
it was a case of bad judgment lorry bad taste
and im just sorry lorry thats all
she says nothing
the angle favoring bartha and sidney mrs
bartha in foreground
bartha now turns on sidney
your friend hunsecker you can tell him for me hes a disgrace to his profession
never mind my bilious private life i print a decent responsible column thats the way it stays
your man theres nothing he wont print if it satisfies his vanity or his spite
hell use any spice to pepper up his daily garbage
tell him i said so and that like yourself hes got the morals of a guinea pig and the scruples of a gangster
sidney tries to brazen it out sneering what do i do now
whistle the stars and stripes forever
bartha slides along the seat reaching for her fur
camera pulls back with her as she collects her belongings slides out between the tables and comes forward passing sidney to her husband
lightly what you do now mr
falco is crow like a hen you have just laid an egg
she presents her fur to her husband and turns her back inviting him to put it around her shoulders
another angle favoring bartha
he has not fully understood the significance of his wifes gesture
he studies her
she confirms his hopes as she adds leo this is one of the cleanest things ive seen you do in years
with the fur around her shoulders she turns and takes her husbands arm with some pride
they walk away
camera erases back to include sidney
he is angry at himself more for the failure of his efforts at blackmail than any sense of shame at the attempt
a medium long shot
at a booth on the other side of the bar sits a dapper gentleman with a twinkle of malice in his eyes
he has been watching the altercation with keen interest and satisfaction
elwell gives some instructions to a waiter who is serving him with drinks pointing towards sidney
sidneys face shows a burning resentment
he glances about him to see how much of the embarrassing scene has been observed
as he moves away the waiter walks into shot addressing him
a waiter approaches sidney
he has a message
otis elwell wants to see you sidney
the waiter nods towards the other side of the circular bar
sidney his humiliation and rage still burning looks off towards
from sidneys viewpoint
he comes round the circular bar
he shows no eagerness to join elwell but approaches the table
elwell makes a gesture inviting sidney to sit
sidney doesnt accept it
pleasantly i see bartha gave you cold tongue for supper
as sidney starts to leave hey wait a minute
hesitating im late for a date with a dame
then returning he leans over the table addressing elwell with quiet anger
otis if youre trying to blow this brawl into an item for your column forget it
across sidney and elwell
elwell is quietly enjoying sidneys display of hurt dignity
affably how is dear old j
by the way
his anger relapsing call him up and ask he might drop dead with shock
lightly if it were that easy you wouldnt find an empty phone booth for the next two hours
a close shot
while elwell continues he is not looking at sidney
elwells expression of dislike of hunsecker is not overemphatic but sidney senses nevertheless that it is very real and this gives him a new idea
continuing over scene talk of a wake
theyd club each other to cater the affair for free
elwell looks up at sidney as he continues
happily by the way did i hear something about j
giving you the flit gun treatment he shut you out of the column
sidney has rapidly resumed his manner of resentment in order to exploit elwells dislike of hunsecker
you dont know that lunatic yet
whims egotistic whims
like the gag when you got him for a friend you dont need an enemy
a pause then thats what the fight with bartha was about
leo i says hunsecker froze me out
so im eating humble pie this month please print me an item
pleased and instead he printed his heel in your face
morose i see youre full of human feelings
he has lost interest in sidney
with a shrug like most of the human race sidney im bored
id go a mile for a chuckle
elwells voice fades his attention has been caught by
three people are passing the table squeezing their way past a man with two very fetching young women
elwells eyes are riveted to the anatomy that is temptingly displayed
noting elwells preoccupation and two miles for a pretty girl
he is unembarrassed at sidneys all too accurate estimate
elwell turns back towards the papers on his table a zippered document case and some publications among which a columnist might search for scandal among these is a magazine of
continuing casually then youre really washed up with hunsecker
the nature of elwells reading tastes is also not lost on sidney
with his eyes glancing at the magazine sidney now accepts the original offer to sit down
he produces the slip of paper that bartha rejected offering it as illustration
this is how much im washed with as elwell reads sidney continues giving a passing scrutiny apparently casual to a picture of a girl on the magazine cover
look otis i make no brief for my bilious private life but hes got the morals of a guinea pig and the scruples of a gangster
elwell shows no undue enthusiasm for the item
dryly a fine fat dirty item
offering it back to sidney whos it about
but sidney doesnt take the paper back he explains a kid named dallas who runs a dinky jazz quintet
he leans closer he keeps company with j
s screwball sister
this does get a reaction a flicker of genuine interest
elwell reads the item for a second time
watching elwell read sidney encourages its a real goody if like me you wanna clobber j
now elwell lays the item down in front of him
clearly he is considering it
sidney prompts again
hes got his tv tomorrow
hed read it just before rehearsals
but he is still reluctant
trouble is i cant think of any good reason why i should print anything you give me
i cant even think of a bad reason
sidney drops his eyes to the magazine once more
he fingers it in a preoccupied but significant way
gently suppose i introduce you to a lovely reason otis
one thats good and bad
his eyes go from the magazine to sidney he gets the point alright
im not an unreasonable man
elwell reaches for the slip of paper once more
in picking it up elwell clearly implies his readiness to accept the item on conditions
sidney in his turn gets this point
he turns towards the passing waiter
rita is in the bedroom
she appears to have some familiarity to the premises
she hears the doorbell
she makes swift adjustment to her appearance and takes a swift gulp of a drink as she carries it through to answer the door
the outer room is lit only by one of the lamps on the desk
rita crosses and goes to the door
sidneys shadow can be seen through the frosted glass
at the door rita opens it slowly and with a seductive manner
sidney steps into the room
rita begins to close the door prior to stepping into his embrace
sidney puts one arm about her
but now she reacts to
otis elwell stands on the landing outside
in most gentlemanly fashion he takes off his hat
this new arrival gets a dismal reaction from the girl
unembarrassed rita say hello to otis elwell
with no welcome whatsoever hello
elwell is not unaware of his cool reception
he glances at sidney as he comes into the room
but his manner is suave
friends call me otis sometimes tricky otis
otis was outraged when i told him van cleve was going to fire you
tell him not to pay any attention to anything you know who says about you know what
to otis right otis
elwell sits down on the sette stretches his limbs smiles at the girl
rita still says nothing
sidney mistakes her attitude for acquiescence
he swallows his drink sets it down
i thought you two could talk the whole thing over till i got back
rita looks at him sharply
one of those business meetings honey always coming up in the middle of the night
he grins at rita
she doesnt respond
turning she goes swiftly through the door into the bedroom
sharply hold on
you can drop me off on your way
emphasizing the asperity in her voice she closes the door behind her
elwell looks at sidney sidney looks at elwell
elwell gets up slowly from the settee
amused by acid consternation reigns
sidney is uncomfortable not sure how elwell is taking the rejection
elwell glances at his wristwatch lays down his drink
quickly now otis
elwell shrugs remarks pleasantly but with significance i hate j
but not that much at this moment
give me a chance he goes into the bedroom closing the door after him
rita is in a flurry of indignation
sitting on the bed she is fastening one high heeled shoe
sidney stands glaring at her
dont you know who that man is
nodding with emphasis yeah
aggressively and hes a perfect stranger to me
explosively so take five minutes
hes an important man hes lonely dont be dumb
rita who one shoe on has begun to search for the other
what do you want all of a sudden lady godiva
wheres my other shoe
what kind of an act is this
rita jumps to her feet
her righteous indignation is handicapped by the lop sided stance caused by the lack of one shoe
dont you think i have any feelings
what am i
a bowl of fruit
a tangerine that peels in a minute
caustic i beg your pardon
i turn myself inside out to help you and now im a heavy
stooping swiftly as he discovers her shoe heres your shoe theres your coat thats the door
contemptuously he thrusts the coat and the shoe into her arms
the positive force of his manner gives the girl pause
there is a silence
rita searches for words to explain the offense to her sensibilities
i dont do this sort of thing
what sort of thing
emphatic this sort of thing
as emphatic listen you need him for a favor dont you
and so do i
i need his column tonight
then didnt you ask me to do something about your job
dont you have a kid in military school
sidney has struck brutally home
ritas lower lip trembles
youre a snake falco
youre a louse a real louse
sidneys manner becomes swiftly sympathetic but still urgent
persuasively honey hes going to help you
you want to lose your job
rita begins to waver her moral indignation losing ground before sidneys reminders of her dire necessity
remonstrating a girl needs a little romancing before she cutting in next time ill call in a guy to paint silver stars on the ceiling
in a small voice what would you think of me if cutting in to reassure her nothing i didnt think of you before
dryly with significance thats what i mean
this attempt at humor signals to sidney that he has brought her round
he comes to her pats her in an encouraging manner to which she does not respond
he turns to the door and picks up the glasses she has set down on the table behind it
as he opens the door how many snorts does it take to put you in that tropical island mood
sidney goes out
elwell overhears the last remark and as sidney passes him he winks
while sidney pours another drink elwell faces the doorway
rita comes into it stands on the threshold
she is still far from enthusiastic
an inspiration havana
thats where we met
rita shakes her head morosely
sidney comes and puts a stiff drink into her hand
elwell raises the glass toasting the girl encouraging her to drink
rita responds dimly
to otis heres mud in your column
sidney laughs more from relief than from the joke
blessings on thee the both
gotta run now
see you two kids later
lightly hurry back
at the door sidney takes cheerful leave of them
dont do anything i wouldnt do
that gives you lots of leeway
closing the door sidney seems pleased with himself
he goes swiftly down the stairs
rita remains on the threshold of the doorway between the two rooms
there is an uncomfortable silence
elwell carries it off by coming to the girl offering her a cigarette
she accepts it
elwell studies her smiling affectionately
rita meets his eyes avoids them again then quietly offers the information palm springs
two years ago
elwell begins to laugh
whatever the memory it seems to amuse him vastly because he continues to laugh
delighted thats right
she adds glumly dont tell sidney
elwell continues to laugh as we
shooting east on th street walks sidney coming out of the entrance of his apartment towards camera
he is pleased with himself satisfied with his ingenuity in dealing with rita and bartha
the streets behind him are dark and empty it is about in the morning
camera moves with sidney as he steps briskly into the orange juice stand and lifts the receiver from the pay telephone
there are no other customers at the counter but the man behind is squeezing orange halves for the day ahead piling up a mountain of empties some of which fall
at sidneys feet
camera shoots up at the penthouse on the roof of the brill bldg
the budweiser sign is extinguished a black silhouette against the sky
a light burns in the window of hunseckers apartment
the ringing of the telephone is heard in the big room an impressively furnished apartment which has a decor indicating that the owner thinks of himself in epic terms
camera moves to discover hunsecker in robe and pajamas tapping at his typewriter
taking his leisurely time he picks up the phone and eventually answers it
to phone yes
you sound happy sidney
why should you be happy when im not
then ill see the papers when i get up
how do you spell picasso the french painter
languidly writes down picasso on his scratch pad answering a query dryly its an item i hear he goes out with three eyed girls
camera shoots past sidney at the phone toward broadway which is now deserted
a street flushing truck goes by moving through the dead city
to phone it would be nice if you mentioned r o b a r d robards jazz joint its his th anniversary
dont begrudge it to me j
i owe him lots of favors
glancing toward the attendant to see that he has not overheard i think you understand dont you that the dallas skull is badly dented
oh real bad
starting today you can play marbles with his eyeballs
even coquetting dont hold out on me j
hangs up and walks to street hunsecker is writing robards name on his pad but he says into the phone we shall see what we shall see
lazily and dont ever use this apartment phone again i have a nervous sister
he cradles the phone looks at it for a moment switches his eyes and then physically follows them rising to stroll towards the glass doors onto the terrace
he moves out and turns aside to look in at the adjoining window which belongs to susans bedroom
camera shoots across susan in foreground she is asleep a tired helpless sweet kid
the figure of her brother is seen a dark shape on the terrace outside
he moves away across the terrace
hunsecker turns from the window
camera is close on his brooding face
camera tracks with him as he crosses towards the parapet
at this height there is a wind which blows his hair and the movement of the camera emphasizes a remarkable vista of the new york skyline
the buildings are now dark only a few of the electric signs are left on all night
camera comes to rest looking over hunseckers shoulder it tilts downward to a view of broadway below duffy square in the distance
a close up hunsecker is looking down on his kingdom
but there is little love in the mans face only authoritarian power
from hunseckers viewpoint
the streets empty except for an occasional passing taxi
the street flushing truck comes up broadway from duffy square
the identical camera set up
through the dissolve the light changes from night to day broadway magically becomes a roaring stream of traffic
in foreground a news vendor
sidney comes out of the exit of a subway reaching for his pocket as he approaches the news vendor who offers him a paper
shaking his head gimme the record
sidney buys and opens the paper
camera moves closer to shoot over his shoulder
we see the gossip column which bears a photograph of otis elwell at the top
smirking with satisfaction sidney turns away from the camera and throws the paper into a trash basket before he disappears into the impressive entrance of a large office building
the sign above the doorway reads the new york globe
mary hunseckers secretary occupies a cubicle which is separated form the rest of the newsroom by a partition
from the big room beyond comes the hum and chatter of a big newspaper
the walls of the urgent murmur of the staff of a big newspaper
the walls of marys cubicle are covered with photographs filing cabinets are piled high with unopened mail two wire service teletype machines click desultorily
mary is plain but attractive past a level headed woman with a sense of integrity
she is on the phone just now bored with the insistent voice on the other end
beside her an earnest young lawyer waits with several papers in hand
to phone i have no power to retract mr
im only mr
nor can i agree that can retraction is necessary
thank you for calling
sidney has come through the newsroom in background
he pauses tactfully seeing mary occupied with the lawyer
huffily i fail to see whats amusing about these papers
ill get the boss to sign them
giving her the papers theyre important
youve said that six times thats why im smiling
as the disgruntled lawyer leaves sidney comes in wearing his most winning smile
with a glance after the lawyer making sure that he is not observed sidney greets mary assuming a brogue hello mary me darlin and phwat are ye up to today
sidneys hand caresses her shoulder with a gesture which indicates a certain intimacy between them
thats a question i usually like to ask you
your secretary phoned
shrugging something about a frank dangelo trying to reach you
sidney reaches for the phone
as he does so mary hesitates and glances at a copy of the record which lies on the desk open at otis elwells column
she picks it up
continuing is that the man who manages susies boyfriend
sidney murmurs casually yeah
as he dials
mary holds up the paper indicating the item
have you seen this
in otis elwells column
reads the dreamy marijuana smoke of a lad who heads a highbrow jazz quintet is giving an inelegant odor to that elegant east side club where he works
thats no way for a card holding party member to act
moscow wont like you naughty boy
sidney accepts the paper from mary examines the item while he talks to sally on the phone
into phone sally
i got the message
if dangelo calls again tell him ill be at the office around noon
he hangs up continuing to read
could this be that boy
he doesnt look like a reefer smoker
he discards the paper with a show of disinterest
mary picks it up again
looking at the record again if this is true j
s going to hit the ceiling
sidney moves around behind mary
his eyes are fixed on a spike which sits on marys desk
on it is impaled a proof of hunseckers column
meanwhile he remarks can it be news to you that j
s ceiling needs a plaster job every six weeks
from sidneys viewpoint hunseckers column
the shot is just too distant for us to be able to read the print
sidney is looking at the column
mary is concentrated on papers before her
without looking up she is clearly aware of sidneys efforts to read the proof
quietly sidney you know that j
doesnt like people to look at the column proof in advance
sidney caught in flagrante laughs
mary im not people theres falco blood sweat and tears in that column
he turns away changing the subject apparently
how about dinner tonight
mary turns to study him
bribing me again
uncomfortable under her scrutiny and why should i bribe the woman who holds most of my heart
mary is thoughtful
without malice in a detached sort of way she examines sidney
youre a real rascal sidney
id certainly dislike you if i didnt like you
youre an amusing boy but there isnt a drop of respect in you for anything alive youre too immersed in the theology of making a fast buck
not that i dont sometimes feel that you yearn for something better
sidney finds this analysis hard to take
again he tries to laugh his way out of it
cynical mary dont try to sell me the brooklyn bridge
i happen to know it belongs to the dodgers
mary smiling decides to let him off the hook
she takes the spike and the column and passes it across to sidneys side of the desk as she returns briskly to her business
affably i dont mind you looking at the proof of the column in advance as long as j
but dont do it like a boy stealing gum from a slot machine
sidney doesnt like this but on the other hand he does want to look at the column
after only a momentary struggle he picks the column off the spike and reads
who put this item in about the comic
reading if theres a more hilarious funny man around than herbie temple at the palace youll have to pardon us for not catching the name
we were too busy screaming
does this temple have a press agent
its one of j
s occasional beau gestes
evidently the fellows funny so he gave him a plug
he goes to the door grinning
whats your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates
lets wait till christmas its more legitimate then
she looks after sidney thinks about him for a moment
then she types
sidney comes down th street from broadway making for the stage door entrance of the palace theatre
he walks confidently into the alleyway paying no attention to the old doorman gossiping with the shoeshine boy at the chairs next to the entrance
the doorman turns protesting calling out hey
sidney without halting looks back towards the doorman addressing him with the patronizing manner of a superior
herbit temple here yet
yeah but you cant come in now
im in sonny boy
he is already on his way into doorway
the movie will soon by finished and the comedian who opens the stage show is ready and made up in the wings
he sits with his agent al evans a small worried bespectacled man who waves an unlighted cigar as big as himself
they converse in loud whispers talking against the muffled and echoing sound of the film sound track silhouetted against the ghostly distorted images on the big screen seen at a
weird angle behind them
i didnt waste words herbie take my word
i says look figo im not selling you a dozen eggs im selling you herbie temple i says so dont gimme your lip
the comedian herbie temple looks up
sidney comes through a fire proof door which separates the stage from the corridors to dressing room
in background two chorus girls in costume are squeezed into a telephone booth
sidney joins the comedian and the agent he smiles to the comedian while he addresses the agent
the agent looks from sidney to temple surprised and displeased
since when did you two get acquainted
sidney has clearly never met evans blandly he chooses to regard the agents remark as an introduction he offers his hand with generous amiability
how do you do mr
the comic accepts the hand doubtfully
im sidney falco
still dubious yeah delighted
evans stands up warns the comic
watch this guy herbie hes a press agent
temples smile congeals
you watch him al i s
in no way discouraged temple i caught your act the other night and did you now
on which bounce
and i just had to drop by and tell you how great i thought you were
what time is it al
you got ten minutes
to sidney hope you dont mind falco were busy and if sidney stands up
no i dont mind
im busy too
were all off to utica so excuse me mr
frannis on the portisan
sidney moves toward the doorway onto the corridor
the chorus girls have now vacated the phone booth
but can i ask one impertinent question here
with no criticism intended because i know al you earn your ten percent how come you let a sock act like herbie temple tip toe through town without a publicity
smiling wise evans shakes his head
were not buying it falco no fish today
sidney presses as if annoyed
im not selling
im just curious thats all
temple turns away from sidney leaving him to evans
answer the man al if he asks you a question
quick before he thinks up another
evans moves to sidney trying to shepherd him out the way he came
temple doesnt believe in press agents does that answer you something
evans makes the mistake of laying a hand on sidneys elbow
sidney doesnt like people touching him
he reacts in anger as we have seen before fixes a burning eye on evans
take your hand off lump
more politely to temple no one believes in press agents temple when they make claims they cant perform
i got nothing to sell i didnt come here to peddle but if i tell a client that hunsecker will give him space its not just talk
sidney stops briskly up the stairs into the corridor
evans angry is stalled for a moment of delay action by mention of the magic name of hunsecker
after hesitation listen you bull artist
let him go al
but sidney has already stepped to the phone booth and is dialing
to phone hello
mary let me speak to j
its sidney falco
shooting past sidney in foreground onto temple and evans beyond they watch him open mouthed
sidney notes their reaction
to phone tell him its important
gloria is at her desk bewildered as she speaks into the phone
is this sidney
to phone sure ill wait
while doing so he glances back with disinterest at evans and temple
the comedian and the agent exchange looks
evans is uneasy he comes up the steps into the corridor to address sidney with a deflated manner
hesitant look nobody hired you
we didnt talk any deal and with his hand over the mouthpiece sidney addresses evans with contempt
i told you im not selling fish
abruptly reverting to the phone j
how are you sweetheart
then seriously listen i know its late j
but is it too late to add something important to the column
grinning no not a relative but important
shaking her head gloria places the phone down on the desk looks at it as it chatters away
she considers returning to her typing but worried picks the phone up again
sidneys chattering voice is barely audible you know herbie temple the comic
what about him
hes at the palace and hes great
thats what about him
and youd do me a big bunny basket of a favor if you would say it in tomorrows column
temple and evans are now staring at sidney with considerable respect
the comedian and the agent in foreground sidney still on the phone beyond
yeah if you got a pencil there ill suggest a word or two
the comedian and the agent in foreground sidney still on the phone beyond
to phone continuing if theres a funnier man in the world than herbie temple at the palace
pardon us for not catching the name we were too busy laughing
no make that screaming
then its sweet of you j
probably see you at twenty one tonight
no for supper late
speak to this lad al
see me in my office
he turns and walks away down the corridor
as he vanishes temple starts after him
sidney walks off in the direction of the exit not so fast that he cant be overtaken
temple hurries into the corridor and comes after him
evans also follows though not so eagerly
wait a minute
turning back to encourage evans speak to him al
to sidney apologetically al makes all my deals
sidney permits himself to be detained
coolly looking toward evans i dont like a guy thats quick with the hands
to temple temple youve been three passes behind for twenty years
this could start you off big t
evans not as wholly convinced as the comedian comes up to join them
temple looks at the agent
and it would cost a pretty penny huh
to evans you tell him i stutter
why dont we wait till tomorrow
sidney shrugging makes a negligent exit
as he goes wait as long as you like you know where my office is
they look after him
evans face is cold and suspecting but temples face contains fresh warmth
sidney comes briskly up the stairs
outside his door he pauses listens hearing the murmur of voices inside
then he walks in casually
sidney steps in closing the door
he pretends surprise as he sees
steve and dangelo waiting for him
sidney comes into shot
sally remains at her desk while steve and dangelo are silent looking at sidney
perkily what is here a wake
dangelo rises from the couch crossing to sidney to hand him a copy of the tabloid the record
it is folded open at elwells column
as he passes it to sidney dangelo marks with his thumbnail an item near the bottom of the column
sidney takes the paper and reads
he reads a little too quickly
then he hands it back to dangelo
steve notes sidneys too perfunctory reading
you read as you run dont you
sidney turns on steve coldly its a habit with me
so now im briefed
glancing at dangelo frank thinks i shouldnt have come here a quick correction excuse me steve
i said namely you shouldnt go around wild blaming people without justification
watchfully to sidney i thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated
why not you
thats your idea of logic
i tell the judge i didnt murder the man the judge says why not you
only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear you or hunsecker or both
explosively dallas ask your own manager hes standing here like a pained wolfhound hunsecker and elwell are enemies to the knife
so how do you get him doing j
quickly it is a favor isnt it
as quickly according to you yeah
continuing rapidly and with heat dallas your mouth is as big as a basket and twice as empty
i dont like you comma but neither do i go along with this column saying you smoke marijuana and belong with the reds
also since were talking repulsive j
wont like this for two cents
dont give me that look dallas j
believes in fair play
and secondly this could splatter his sister with rotten egg by implication your her boyfriend
sidneys manner is a little too vigorous
in adopting an aggressive tone he is really trying to needle steve
steve though on the verge of losing his temper is sharp enough to notice the point youre talking very fast
expostulating well ill tell you what excuse me for breathing will ya
wheeling to sally how do you like it
he comes to my office and sensing the danger dangelo moves forward soothingly between them
boys this gets nobody nowhere youre over excited steve and sharply dont apologize for me frank
excited with good reason i wanted to say
to sidney because this endangers the future of the whole quintet
lightly should i cry
steve with a glare at both men goes to the phone on sallys desk
continuing people catch on quick to such an item
van cleve already called me hes firing the quintet
then what are you doing here
go over there and fight
if van cleve fires your boy it gives a lie the ring of truth
in background steve speaks quietly into the phone i want to speak to miss hunsecker please
replying to sidneys question were on our way there now
who has wheeled on steve what are you calling her for
sidneys reaction to the mention of susans name gives steve food for thought
while he waits for susan to be summoned to the phone he studies sidney
to sidney im the boyfriend remember
i hope one day shell be my wife
into the phone gently this is steve susie
dont be alarmed susie but i want you to look at elwells column in the record
no about me
susan is on the phone
listening to what steve says she is frightened almost too frightened it is as if in some curious sense she had been expecting this blow
it brings an echo of an earlier tragedy
what kind of smear
where are you
steve is on the phone in foreground the others watching him
in particular sally who stands near steve is studying him with obvious sympathy
she looks slowly towards sidney
to the phone were on our way to the elysian room to dicker with van cleve hes fired us already
ill call you later dear
he hangs up quietly looks at sidney and walks towards the door
come on frank
as the door closes behind steve frank follows more slowly
as dangelo reaches the door he pauses with his hand on the doorknob and turns back to study sidney
he feels uneasy under dangelos scrutiny
sally in background is also watching sidney
to dangelo what are you looking at
he does not answer for a moment
the unspoken accusation in his look is very clear
then quietly the ugly world sidney
a pause if i told steve what i really think hed tear your head off
he brazens it out
sneering tell him
dangelo shakes his head
im interested in his future
dangelo goes slowly out
he hesitates before turning towards sally because he realizes that this exchange with dangelo must have confirmed sally in her suspicions
her face shows that sidney is right
sally is deeply hurt disillusioned
sidney turns to her challenging
whats the matter
not looking at him nothing
resentfully sidney moves about the room
sensing the silent accusation against him he is aggressive
you know sally sometimes i get the impression you think you live in star bright park
this is life kid get used to it
sidney comes to the phone on her desk
then he glances swiftly at sally and carrying the phone walks into the bedroom dragging the long cord behind him
when the phone comes alive sidney pushes the bedroom door shut
the gesture is as casual as he can contrive to make it
keeping his voice fairly low so that it cannot be heard in the other room he says to phone nikko is mr
this is mr
well have him call me as soon as he can
he sets the phone down on the bedside table looks at it thoughtfully before he goes back to the bedroom door opens it and goes back into the office
sidney stands on the threshold studying sally
his manner is now more sympathetic as he asks did you send my folks in philly the check
leaving the bedroom door open sidney comes up to her watches her shrewdly cautiously
softly i put a lotta trust in you chickie
low voiced i know you do sidney
dont judge a situation where you dont know whats involved
sally is putting paper in the typewriter trying to hold her head up
im not judging
sidney comes closer to her
he puts his hand on the nape of her neck carrassing her
under his touch the girl is unhappy and yet at the same time responsive
sidney still has power over her but she is disturbed by feelings of shame
feeling her relaxed sidney bends and kisses her on the side of the throat with more than negligence for something about her always excites him his aggression tune in with
pathetically i swear sidney i cant help it sometimes i wonder what i see in you
murmuring thats no way to talk
or what you see in me for that matter
stay down town tonight
maybe well take in a show etc
if you want me to the phone in the bedroom rings
sidney reacting sharply forgets his advances to sally as he turns towards the bedroom
exhilarated you see
hunseckers gotta phone me
he goes into the bedroom closing the door as he goes
sally looks at the closed door
sidney has picked up the phone
calmly hello j
i presume you saw the elwell smear
smiling no no medals not yet
oh its worse than that aunty van cleve is firing them
from the horses mouth
they were just here in a panic
hunsecker wears a dressing gown as he sits at his breakfast table
behind him are the big glass windows to the terrace overlooking the manhattan skyline
the papers are at hunseckers elbow his manner is crisp and cold who was just there
then youll be the death of me
didnt you just tell me that theyve already traced this smear to you
all they have to do now is to put two and two together and im a chicken in a pot
sidney smiles confidently answers calmly j
peace on earth good will to men its working out just the way i planned
yeah i guarantee this bomb will pop right on schedule but you have to play your part you be a saint and let me be the devil
but i wanna talk to you first
hunsecker pauses eyes full of cold voltage
dont come here
susie is up and about
listening he called her
youd better see me at the tv three oclock
he bangs down the phone tense thought in his manner
sally is busy with her typing again but in a depressed mood when sidney comes out of the bedroom to put the phone down on her desk again
he seems satisfied with himself smug
sally watches him for a moment
then what are you going to do
sidney prepares to leave the apartment
his tone is full of confidence self assertive
for once sidney is certain that he is smarter more cunning than even hunsecker
the wise one chickie a lotta people think theyre smart
theyre dumb theyll do the work for me
sidney makes for the door goes out
susan buys paper dolly with her toward elevator she gets in
has not moved he is thoughtful and morose
nikko the japanese butler comes in to remove the breakfast table
the table can wait
i have to think about my tv show
pleased to do
i will come back later
abruptly did you put the bread out on the terrace for the birds
yes but they dont come no more this time of year
smiling nikko leaves
hunsecker picks up a pencil and makes a note on a pad about birds no doubt
abruptly he looks up calling susie
come in a minute dear
she has been trying to pass unnoticed to her room
she comes forward to him her manner is serious and wary
his act is one of a tasteful mammy singer but he is watchful too
susie youre very much in my thoughts today
what a question dear with that newspaper in your hand
pausing did sidney tell you about it
yes he phoned
i dont know this boy too well
anything in these charges
she shakes her head
not being partial are you
with quiet certainty no im not
he soothes smiles indulgent but watchful susie take it easy
ill trust your judgment you dont have to protest with me
with a paternal gesture of affection he holds out his arms inviting her into his comforting embrace
not wanting to she walks into his open waiting arms
why are you trembling dear
history repeats itself
everything that happened to alan leslie
began with a smear like this
hunsecker considers this gravely as if it was a new and troubling thought
she leaves his arms he watches keenly
incoherent its just as if ive seen a ghost today
quickly but that wasnt your fault dear what happened to leslie
ive told you that a million times
he goes to her gently she appraises both him and her wrenched life with brooding frightened eyes
then whose fault was it j
it was someones fault wasnt it
gravely i wouldnt have called the boy exactly balanced
stronger alan was not
unbalanced when i married him
and he was not
indifferent to women no matter what they said
simply im not fighting with you puss
she gets up and walks around in considerable agitation
he never would have killed himself if i hadnt gone through with the annulment
dont you see that made all the rumors seem true
i should have stood up for him
not run out
she turns to hunsecker her manner firmer
i want you to get them back their job steve and the quintet
incredulously you mean theyve been fired already on the basis of this crude smear
he walks away with a wag of indignation but turns asking susie youre sure there isnt some fire where theres this much smoke
susan shakes her head emphatically
earnestly i know steve
then maybe you can tell me if hes as solid as you say why does he rap me every chance he gets
involuntarily sidney is a liar
who said sidney
defiantly i said sidney
staring he pauses then he deftly changes the subject
you know dear were drifting apart you and i and i dont like that
i thought we were talking about sidney
with rasp let me finish dear
you had your say now let me have mine
interrupting i havent said anything yet j
but if susan hesitates
hunsecker waits for her to continue
but she isnt yet sure enough of herself or of the point she means to make
she turns away
gently i started to say were drifting apart
a year ago in your wildest dreams would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me
today i had to call you in
im taking up the situation with you now
interrupting susie i want to help you theres nothing i wont do for you
youre all ive got in the whole wide world
hunsecker strides about elaborately playing on a note of disillusion and pain
continuing well what have i got
alimony to a pair of tramps
theyre of no concern to me
its you who count but dont get me wrong i dont intend to let you break your neck again
you said you want to help me prove it
get steve back his job
pausing he means that much to you
then with your prestige it only takes a minute ten cents worth of american tel and tel
youre picking up my lingo hon
levelly i read your column every day
he looks at her with pursed lips and for a change some real interest
her level straightforward manner has pinned him down completely he shows a slow charming grin as he goes for a private phone book susie i like this new attitude of
youre growing up and i like it
i dont like it when youre limp and dependent when youre odd and wayward
this gives you a chance for real survival in a very lousy world
because dont forget dear you wont always have me with you will you
no i wont
he crosses to the white desk phone delaying dialing for a moment this dallas boy must be good for you
why not bring him around today before the show
this time ill clean my glasses for a better look
susan doesnt like this idea is evasive im not sure i can reach him in time
easily sure you can if you want to and i know youll want to
then by the way whats your beef against little sidney
steadily when im certain ill let you know
a man couldnt ask for a squarer shake
into phone let me have billy van cleve
then dont ever tell anyone susie how im tied to your apron strings
to phone billy
whats this about that boy
where are we lug in a drawing room comedy
youre brain is warming up sweetheart yeah dallas
then no dont explain your point of view but
camera shoots towards the entrance to the tv theatre
a line of people are queuing for hunseckers tv broadcast which is advertised by large posters beside the entrance
a taxi drives up in foreground susan hunsecker gets out
sidney comes up sixth avenue towards the theatre
as he reaches the corner of the building he halts having seen
susan is seen in the act of paying the driver
as the taxi pulls away susan walks camera left
susan pauses deciding not to enter the theatre turning she looks about her and waits on the sidewalk outside
sidney decides that this is not the moment to approach susan
he glances down the sidestreet then moves off in that direction
sidney moves down the sidestreet towards a stage entrance through which are emerging some tv technicians
he slips inside
hunsecker is standing at a table stop watch in hand reading aloud from a script which he is rehearsing and timing
beside him sits mary busy typing more of the material from hunseckers handwritten note
mary is calm but he is irritable trying to concentrate despite the bustle around him
an old movie star mildred tam sits waiting in one of the canvas backed chairs supplied for the guests on the show
burton a manager also waits deadpan at hunseckers elbow
hunsecker clicks his stop watch as he reads i was reminded of it this morning when i noticed that the birds had gone south
we want the same kind of freedom for ourselves thats what the man said
he clicks the watch pauses to underline the phrase continues a man has the right to face his accusers
thats the american way
the man said
he turns in exasperation to burton
burton dont stand around
if i go over ill cut some items off the tail
mary whips a second sheet out of the typewriter hands it to hunsecker
as he accepts it hunsecker looks off towards the auditorium
shooting towards the auditorium from hunseckers viewpoint
sidney mounts the steps onto the stage
seeing that the columnist is surrounded but knowing that j
wants to talk to him privately sidney loiters so that j
can join him as soon as he chooses to
camera pulls back to include hunsecker
only momentarily distracted by private considerations connected with sidneys arrival hunsecker returns to the business of timing the script
he clicks the watch again
from washington through to jefferson from lincoln and f
right up to today the democratic way of life
thats what the man said
nowadays it doesnt export to well
then concluding but you know
and i know
that our best secret weapon is d e m o dropping to a modest tone lets never forget it ladies and gentlemen
sidney lingers beside the old movie star who is listening rapt to hunseckers words
sidney is less impressed with j
at the conclusion mildred applauds lightly
she stands up and moves towards j
wants to talk to sidney but is frustrated by the old movie star
thats grand just grand j
then anxiously is my makeup all right
you know despite the scads of movies ive made ive never appeared on tv yet
cutting her short of course mildred
you look fine
swiftly summoning mary mary help miss tam anything she wants shes our star today
under the pretense of studying the typed script j
walks away across the stage
sidney strolls after him
a tracking shot
sidney comes up beside hunsecker falls into step beside him
as they cross towards a water cooler at the back of the stage they talk in rapid undertone
i got that boy coming over here
a glance at sidney whats so funny
who is smiling faintly with a pocket fulla firecrackers good
narrowly i think you loused this up but good
if i can trust my eyes and i think i can susie knows all about your dirty work
shrugging cant hurt
incredulously cant hurt
i had to get him back his job
smugly i like that too
closer faster look j
we can wrap this up in one neat bundle addressed to the dumps to oblivion
were going great but please play it my way
i cased this kid
know his ins and outs
hes fulla juice and vinegar just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze
do little sidney a favor squeeze
you know j
the porcupine bit needles
but its too late
i got him back the job
impatiently no thats the point he wont accept your favor
the manager yes but not the boy
well hes got her in a tizzy ill tell you that
sure he steams her up wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz
and whos feet is she on now
a hasty addition thats according to st
whats this boy got that susie likes
integrity acute like indigestion
what does that mean integrity
repeating as before a pocket fulla firecrackers looking for a match
grinning its a new wrinkle to tell the truth
i never thought id make a killing on some guys integrity
hunsecker gives him certain slow begrudging admiration full of beans aint you
but you know that youll stand or fall by what youre doing now
grins confidently calculated risk
only we happen to know j
that you like me
im your star pupil i reflect back to you your own talent
hunsecker permits himself a faint smile
burton is approaching with script in hand
i wouldnt like to take a bite of you youre a cookie full of arsenic
he turns away and goes off towards the auditorium in the background
frank dangelo pays a taxi out of which he and steve have just emerged
frank turns towards the boy resuming a conversation as they stroll across the sidewalk towards the entrance of the theatre
depressed i still think hes responsible for the smear
not that im convinced but youll never prove it in a million years
gently steve youll do what you want but it cant hurt he offers you an olive branch so today like olives
i guess youre right but steve completes the sentence with a slow shake of the head compromise is a gesture which he finds very difficult
dangelo studies the boy with a paternal affection
steve sometimes its better not to look at your own honesty but to look the other man in the face
not because youre my meal ticket which you are but because i like you and the boys please take my advice we dangelo stops halted by an expression which he
sees in steves face
he is looking through the glass doors of the tv theatre no longer listening to dangelos words his face has hardened in anger
from steves viewpoint
sidney has come out of the curtained entrance to the auditorium
camera pulls back to include steve in foreground
with a movement that suggests his annoyance at discovering sidney present steve jerks open the glass door and moves in
susan is waiting in the foyer
she is standing in a position where she has not been able to see steve until he enters now she moves forward to greet him
as soon as she is near him she speaks in a quiet urgent manner in an undertone steve before we go in id like to
but she too is halted as steve lays a hand on her arm
seeing his look over her shoulder she turns
he is already strolling forward to join them
camera pans with him to include susie steve and dangelo
hey susie this is a real surprise not one but three
s just finishing up his rehearsal
hunsecker comes forward to the front of the stage looking towards
in the group that comes down the aisle of the empty theatre
he studies them then calls out looks like a wedding
hunsecker back to camera in foreground he begins to whistle the wedding march to the rhythm of steve and susans walk
he breaks the rhythm of his stride his face rigid
he descends to meet them his manner is full of welcome
susan nervously makes the introduction steve is nervous dangelo hangs behind warily sidney is in background
steve you remember my brother
together of course
steve shakes the hand that the smiling hunsecker gives
well son looks like you went out and bought yourself a packet of trouble
youve been very kind about it mr
give susie credit for that
i took her word that there was nothing to the smear
matter of fact ill have my say about smears on the show today
thats why id like your personal assurance too
hunsecker theres nothing to that smear
you have my sincere word
nodding judicially ill by that son
now you owe me a favor
pausing to susan be good to my kid sister
solemnly yeah shes had a peck of trouble for a kid
hunsecker flicks a look at sidney
no one else warier by the minute knows what to say
hunsecker purrs onward susie likes to keep her girlish secrets
but in her heart of hearts i imagine dallas that she fancies you in an uncommon way
now what about you son
not just tom catting around
hunsecker cuts her off with lazy good nature take it easy susie
he wouldnt be much of a man if he didnt understand my concern
would you son
pausing quietly no i wouldnt
nodding serious as a deacon
i like it
i like your style son
in a world of old rags and bones i like it
for instance take sidney
hunsecker crosses toward sidney
if sidney got anywhere near susie id break a bat over sidneys head
smiling faintly sidney lives so much in a moral twilight that when i said you were coming here he predicted disaster
you wouldnt take my favor youd chew up the job he said and spit it right back in my face
sniffing any truth in that
steve is thrown for a loss momentarily frank steps in
hunsecker and if i can amplify motionless dont amplify
steve wantsa thank you for this favor
he provocatively frank you dont listen
just told you to shut your mouth
hotly dont you think its about time you shut yours
who are you to tell a man like frank dangelo to shut up
warningly steve that isnt important but steve on a heated rip has turned to hunsecker does he have to be here in our hair
why has he bothered you before
is it news to you
son lots of people tell me im a gifted man but i still cant see around corners
tolerantly just exactly what are you so hot about
waiting i mean i know its a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds but impatiently nuts
im not here as an artist
im here as an average joe who happens to love your sister susie
with ironic smirk well just be careful you dont knock her down huh
steve stops dead
then strangely and dangerously he picks up hunseckers smile
on each mans face the smile broadens and grows up into a chuckle from each but the meanness still flickers around hunseckers mouth
steve is out of the net
affably frankly son you lost me on that last hill
just give us the punch line
agreeably no punch line
maybe i was just admiring your know how yours and falcos
why do you keep coupling me with falco
innocently hes here isnt he
do you think sir when he dies hell go to the dog and cat heaven
even hunsecker smiles
sidney likes neither the ridicule or the turn of events
he moves quickly past camera
sidney comes round the row of theatre seats to attack steve
lets forget cats and dogs and other pseudo literary remarks ill just lay it on the line
what about that big rumpus in my office today
you were there frank
where according to st
was responsible for the elwell smear
dont go wild sidney
take a look at them and see whos wild
playing along nicely hunsecker looks at steve and frank and slowly removes his arm from susan he pauses before asking dallas what about that
uneasily steve was excited
he didnt mean it exactly the way its stated here
to steve how did you mean it
what he likes to j
i dont want to say with a roar hunsecker takes them both out of play he stands up
hunsecker enters from behind camera
both of you keep quiet
to sidney youve made more damage here in one minute than a plague of locusts
if youre tired susie sit down this needs investigation
to steve quieter how did you mean it
waiting come on lets go
steve is cornered the other completely out of play
he pauses i dont take kindly to you and falco selling me ethics
whos the injured party here you
with contempt right now youre in no position to ask questions
and your snide remarks stronger wait a minute i havent handed over punishing privileges to you yet
put the whip down and i might respect what youre saying
switching his leonine tail hunsecker looks broodingly at susie
frank says one beseeching word steve
but no one hears him
susie did you know about this accusation
abruptly before you leave son ill answer your question susan hunsecker is the injured party here
balefully or will i be hearing next that i dont even have my sisters welfare at heart
steve hesitates defensively but cant resist a small smile he moves nearer to susan
hunsecker youve got more twists than a barrel of pretzels
unturning you hear that susie
to steve continue please
shaking his head im afraid i cant cope with them
susan in foreground steve hunsecker and sidney beyond
simply youre too shrewd for me so ill just be honest
susie and i love each other if im not mistaken and we want to get married
hunsecker pauses sidney throws in a stage whisper give him credit the boys gall is gorgeous
why dont we hear what susie has to say
sardonically thats stout of you dallas but susie may not care to air her dismal views in public
steve walks to susie trying to lift her with his hopes and air of gentle urging and support
she stares at the floor
hunsecker doesnt like the drift of things his mouth tightens and he speaks to susan with veiled warning susie as always is free to say anything she thinks
go on dear say exactly whats on your mind dear
those dears sound like daggers
may i suggest that you stop daring her to speak
may i lift my eyebrows
what is this
what are you trying to do
strongly im trying to get susie to stand up to you
but your manner is so threatening that shes afraid to speak
son you raise your voice again and youll be outa here on your golden pratt
suddenly susan lets loose with restrained nervous energy she is near to tears
steve if only for my sake i want this stopped
and the same goes for you too j
contritely susie im sorry if bitterly sometimes i think all men are fools
restraining tears she runs up the steps to the stage
steve looks after her
sidney watches intently
hunseckers smile is frostily taunting you see dallas a plague on both our houses
then we may have to call this game on account of darkness
steve turns a blank eyed stare at him
tension gone a slow mumbling fatigue has set in
hunsecker plays it light if looks could kill im dead
slowly no i dont care about you youre fantastic
my whole interest if its not too late is in susie
and how to undo what youve done to her
smiling and what have i done to her besides not buy her a new fur coat lately
sidney you were right the boys a dilly
because i dont like the way you toy with human lives
your contempt and malice
because i wont be the accomplice of your sick ego and the way its crippled susie
you think of yourself you and your column you see yourself as a national glory
but to me and thousands of others like me you and your slimy scandal your phony patriotics to me mr
hunsecker you are a national disgrace
blandly son i dont fancy shooting mosquitoes with elephant guns
so suppose you just shuffle along and call it a day
he turns and stares away but steve stops him with but my day with susie isnt over yet and cold tenll get you fifty youre playing hookey from a padded
hunsecker comes up the steps from the auditorium sidney following closely behind
in background beyond steve and dangelo are walking up the aisle to the exit
camera tracks close on sidney and hunsecker
hunseckers face is rigid
sidney close at his elbow whispers softly you did it j
you did it good
sidney is full of confidence
but hunsecker barely hears him hunsecker has been hurt very deeply by the boys attack in particular by the appalling fear that what steve has said is the kind of
thing which susan may also secretly believe
susan is still standing in the wings
mary is with her obviously sympathetic
the girl is drying her eyes with kleenex and mary glances at her employer with a look of reproach
hunsecker walks round the table obviously trying to approach susan seeing this susan turns away and moves further from him
there is some emotion in his face as he looks towards the girl
more gently he moves forward past camera
sensing the approach of hunsecker behind her she moves away again she is still crying but is trying to recover
presently hunsecker approaches her again
he speaks very gently soothingly comforting
softly you in a mood susie to run over to milgrims later and buy a few new frocks
a small voice no
im going home
hunsecker again tries to come nearer to her
want sidney to drive you over
ignoring the shake of her head he calls to sidney
drive susie home
again we see some emotion in his face as he studies the girl
his eyes flick towards the stage behind him where sidney stands watching
he moves gently forward and then speaks in a quiet voice which reveals how desperately he needs her reassurance susie
id have to take it very much amiss if you ever saw that boy again
after a pause she turns towards him she looks him straight in the face
levelly ill never see him again
he seems to take this as a gesture of forgiveness from her
now he touches her
his need for her is apparent he tries to reach her tries to find an excuse to embrace her
she submits to this very passively
a very close shot
we see the effort with which she is controlling herself
satisfied with this crumb of affection from his sister hunsecker lets her go
susan moves away still avoiding his eyes
then she goes off towards the steps down into the auditorium
sidney looks at hunsecker then after susan and follows her
he goes back to mary and the script
he instructs her call van cleve
tell him he was right
tell him i said the dallas boys are not worthy of his club
poring over the typewritten pages he senses marys eyes on him
he speaks to her quietly without raising his head and there is still an undertone of feeling in his voice without looking up mary
for susies own good
dont give her misplaced sympathy
mary says nothing
hunsecker gathers his papers and with a visible effort to resume his public personality turns towards the machinery of the television broadcast in background
susan crosses towards the doors out onto the street
sidney comes behind her watchful as he overtakes her near the doors
he goes past her to open the door for her
ill get you a cab
susan stops dead
coldly get away from me
she goes out into the street
beyond we see a crushing cab
hesitating sidney adds j
asked me to drive you over and but susan has already moved out of shot hurrying across the sidewalk to hail the taxi
uncertain what to do whether to follow her or not he moves after her
she has already opened the door of the taxi
she turns to see sidney come up behind her
as he enters shot she repeats i told you to leave
i dont know if stevell ever talk to me again and im ready to blame it all on you
she starts to get into the cab
alert he moves to detain her anxious to know exactly the extent of her suspicion
as sidney steps up he grasps at the door of the taxi trying to hold it open but susan pulls it shut catching his fingers in the door
sidney steps back in pain
it drives off down sixth avenue
nursing the injury to his hand he looks after the disappearing taxi
as he recovers from the pain his expression slowly changes to one of thoughtful appraisal
susans suspicions maybe of less importance than some other considerations
hunsecker and sidney are washing in adjoining basins
coat off the former is in one of his punitive moods of silence
sidney despite his throbbing bandaged finger is feeling satisfied and self confident
he hums quietly
hunsecker throws him annoyed side glances but sidney refuses to catch on
the following dialogue is spaced between the washing the drying and hair combing
so thats what integrity looks like
well im always willing to learn
later how is that slob dangelo your uncle
sidney no longer hums after a moment he answers
my mothers side her brother
that reminds me j
susie looks run down
she can stand a vacation and so can you
people say oh the great j
hes made of iron
but you can use a rest guy
sidneys cheerfulness annoys hunsecker
what are you so chipper about
if i put a cross on every one of your mistakes youd look like a graveyard
smiling but not for anything i did today
sidney i know human nature
susie lied to me shell see that boy again
hunsecker moves out of shot
youre right j
she wont give him up but it doesnt matter
because the real money ball is the boy not susan
and if hearing the sound of the door sidney turns sharply
camera moves to discover that hunsecker has gone out
sidney quickly finishing the brushing of his hair follows
two waiters are fussing over hunseckers table at which places are already set for sidney and hunsecker
matre d hands him an envelope as he passes
hunsecker this was to be delivered to you personally when the columnist comes up to the table the waiters quickly pull out the table for him
sidney comes to join him sidney gets some attention but considerably less
these drinks are warm
you said you like to have them on your table
what are you a critic
ill change forget it
to sidney the real money ball is the boy
yeah the boy
were on the verge of a farce a real farce
as i see it if susie had stood behind him today he might have proved a threat
but since primarily hes wedded to his work hes not going to be able to take it
a waiter shifts the position of the salad dish at hunseckers elbow
to waiter stop tinkering pal that horse radish wont jump a fence
the waiter retreats rapidly
in brief j
its all over because any hour now the boy will give her up
is it a farce or not
delicately salting his oysters hunsecker looks obliquely at sidney
this syrup youre giving out sidney you pour over waffles not j
what do you mean that lousy kid will give up my sister
hunsecker with a casual gesture tugs lightly at the end of sidneys tie
hunseckers gesture is playful but it inflicts great injury to sidneys dignity sidney cannot bear to be touched he finds this liberty on j
s part as intolerable as anything he has experienced and only with great difficulty controls himself
the shot favors sidney
hunsecker continues are you listening
warily how does it matter whos sister
the main thing theyre through and from sidneys viewpoint
without turning hunsecker interrupts am i supposed to forget how that boy talked to me today
sidney senses a warning in hunseckers manner
he protests j
is he worthy of a second glance from a man like you
is he i mean
from sidneys viewpoint
pausing during the process of eating hunsecker reaches into an inside pocket
brief epitaph the boy was talking when he should have been listening
then bite on this
camera pulls back to include sidney as hunsecker tosses in front of him an envelope
sidney opens it extracts two steamship tickets
as he eats for the next sailing of the mary
susans run down shes never been abroad and as you so cogently put it im not made of iron
sidney slowly pushes the envelope back to hunsecker who leaves it lying on the table before him
now that louse is outa susies hair for good
he has an instinct to laugh but something tells him not to
as sidney makes no response hunsecker slowly carefully continues in a voice which is dangerously soft i want that boy taken apart
shooting across hunsecker onto sidney
sidney puts down his fork
he sees now that the issue is serious and must be faced
seriously why do something that would drive them right back into each others arms
not to mention that this time susie would know who shot the arrow
interjecting quietly she knows now
quickly why give her real proof
you nearly ruined her with her first husband and you were right j
but she almost followed him out the window
what do you want a chronic invalid
he wants no advice from sidney
he interrupts with quiet savagery
i know how to handle susie
you just handle the boy sidney
scribbles on scratch pad preferably tonight
pushes pad across to sidney shooting across hunsecker onto sidney
sidney feels sick
why whats tomorrow a holiday
camera moves closer as sidney picks scratch pad up
we can read two words get kello
i think ill go home maybe i left my sense of humor in another suit
hunsecker finishes eating
during the ensuing speech which he begins quietly and sensibly hunseckers venomous feelings are unexpectedly betrayed
youve got that god given brain learn to use it
do you think its a personal matter with me this boy
are you telling me i see things in terms of personal pique
dont you see that today that boy wiped his feet on the choice on the predilections of sixty million men and women of the greatest country in the world
if you had any morals yourself you would understand the immorality of that boys stand today
it was not me he criticized it was my readers
camera pulls back to include sidney
hunsecker manages to control himself he reaches with nervous fingers toward his scribbling pad
sidneys face has tightened
he has begun now to realize the extent of this mans megalomania
after a moment he says im leaving j
shooting across sidney onto hunsecker
a quiet warning dont remove the gangplank sidney you may wanna get back on board
sidney feels the chill of despair upon him
this crab gumbo terrific
shooting across hunsecker onto sidney
a waiter has come to serve the next course
hunsecker appears relaxed but sidney is sightlessly staring at the piece of paper in his hand
he speaks with a quaver in his voice for he has worked hard to make a life which is now ready to relinquish j
its one thing to wear your dog collar
but when it gets to be a noose
id rather have my freedom
the man in jail is always for freedom
sidney begins to get up from the table
as he rises except if youll excuse me im not in jail
hunsecker looks up at sidney
from sidneys viewpoint
easily sure youre in jail sidney
youre a prisoner of your own fears of your own greed and ambition youre in jail
from hunseckers viewpoint
if youre trying to he leans over hunsecker and the camera pulls back to include hunsecker in f
interrupting you little boy dont know who you are
talking around corners with the big shots ten dollar dinners fourteen suits and cashmere coats you tell yourself thats who you are
later you wont know who you are without a penthouse on upper park
but underneath it all ratting around from day to day you do know who you are
youre a fearful ignorant nobody a poor wop kid from the slums of philly hoping nobody else finds it out
a close up
he knows the truth of what is said
but he takes refuge in quiet retaliation a little hunch occurs to me you have just painted a self portrait
you know who you are because you scare people thats what youve got against this boy
he hunsecker is prepared to give it out but not take it
cutting in i told you what i want you to do tonight
he looks down on hunsecker leans over the table
youre blind mr
this is a crossroads for me
i wont get kello
not for a life time pass to the polo grounds
not if you serve me ingrid bergman on a plate
camera has pulled back to include hunsecker whose attention has returned to his food
over patient sidney i told you continuing j
i swear to you on my mothers life i wont do it
he leans even closer if you gave me your column i wouldnt do a thing like that
but as he speaks the last words sidneys voice falters because he has glanced down at the table
we see that an idea has entered his head an idea that takes the wind out of his indignation
his eyes lift rapidly to hunseckers face
delicately touching the envelope and who do you think writes the column while susie and i are away for three months
he is quite speechless
over scene hunseckers voice continuing the man in the moon
camera shoots across sidney again onto hunsecker
hunsecker leans back looks at sidney
seeing that sidney has accepted the proposition he smiles
softly thank you sidney
in a pleasantly affable way he leans across the table to tap the hand with which sidney is leaning on the table
and sidney ill have that piece of paper back
helplessly sidney unclenches a fist and reveals the slip of paper which he had meant to keep
hunsecker takes it
with his eyes on sidney he slowly tears it up
dangelo is buying a cigar at the counter
he turns as steve opens the door of one of the booths and comes out
steve is in a gloomy irksome mood dangelo is sympathetic and fatherly
shell be down in a minute
camera tracks with them as they come out into the hallway
they move towards the side entrance away from the elevators
what does she wanna see you about
the boy shrugs impatiently
she didnt say
some passersby come down the hall and enter a waiting elevator barely glancing at dangelo and the boy
dangelo feels uneasy
i could think of better places to meet her instead of here
he lives on the whole top floor
carelessly i doubt that it matters any more
he addresses steve soberly
you made a very dangerous enemy of him today
matter of fact im very glad we got the tour ahead
if im any judge you hurt him today where he lives
he wont forget it and he wont forgive
steve is silent
he hears the sound of the elevator door opening and turns
susan comes out of the elevator the one farthest from them and looks around
as she comes forward to join them good evening mr
dangelo acknowledges her greeting touches his hat and retires tactfully
susan faces steve
its an awkward meeting
each does not know where the other stands
she has thrown her fur coat about her shoulders like a cloak it will keep slipping off
he is faintly embittered a little hurt and baffled but he is sympathetic he is involved and concerned
im glad you could come
why did you call me
would you buy me a cup of coffee
susan nods in the direction of the door into the little cafe
as he walks with her towards the cafe were on our way to robards for a benefit
ive only got five minutes
as they enter the cafe the counterman looks up from counting the days take at the far end
too late for service
just two cups of java
with a twinkle we serve here only moka coffee
smiling faintly make it moke
the counterman goes to the urn for the coffee
a closer angle
they talk in quiet undertones
steve waits for her to speak first she starts slowly hesitantly with difficulty steve
what you tried to do today
you tried to take me up on a high mountain
i couldnt go all the way
i failed you
a pause will you forgive me
then have i lost you steve
well maybe i was wrong too
but theres no doubt susie that we have to face some serious things
no ones ever stood up to my brother the way you did
quietly to the point but you didnt do much about it susie
you walked out and there i was
and not too good at that
i just didnt think that i could antagonize him steve for our sake i mean
susie i was there for our sake too
but what a world it would be if we were all afraid to learn to walk and talk because it might offend poppa
by the way i think your brother was completely responsible for the smears
this accusation is made lightly in passing
but susan reacts to it trying to interject steve i
overriding her but i dont care about that now
he knew what he was doing today
he was laying down the conditions under which he might consent to our marriage if i would bend to every whim of his like sidney
i couldnt do that susie
after a pause she says youre saying goodbye arent you
steve flares up
im saying that for your sake you have to make a clean break with your brother
wrenched but please steve please one step at a time
i was born only yesterday
pausing softer i told your brother i couldnt be his accomplice
i cant be yours either susie and encourage him to go on pulverizing you
i know what type hes my old man all over again
susan pathetically despairing fingers the handle of her coffee cup which she has not touched
the coat slips from her shoulders
steve stoops to pick it up replaces it on her shoulders
this beautiful coat is more than just a coat
i hate it
its a mink straight jacket
susan turns to him
she is deflated lacking all will power
drooping steve i feel exhausted
what do you want me to do
not sure of himself not what youre doing now
at least dont ask me dont ask him
youre fighting for your life
what do you want to do
pausing woodenly you are saying goodbye arent you
he reacts vigorously protesting impatiently thats fish four days old
i cant buy it susie
right out of that mouth i love like youre a ventriloquists dummy your brother is saying goodbye
you want me to be honest dont you
a despairing cry no steve i dont
not if it kills me i dont
it takes her a moment to recover
when she does so she gets up leaving the counter
without luster lets not talk any more
you have to go
she moves towards the exit into the hallway he follows
dangelo is waiting for them
silently they come up to join him very depressed
susan looks towards dangelo speaks a little pathetically goodbye mr
take care of steve
softly i will miss hunsecker
he walks a little way down the corridor again leaving them alone
she smiles at him trying to smile trying to make a joke
say something funny
steve steps to her quickly kisses her
then he turns and swiftly walks off down the corridor without a backward glance
he goes past dangelo who walks quietly after him towards the exit in background
she remains just in the attitude in which he left her
steve comes out of the door pauses without looking back
dangelo comes up behind him
after a moment look back frank see if shes still standing there
dangelo looks discreetly over his shoulder
from dangelos point of view
she is still standing where steve left her
dangelo turns back to steve
steve still without looking back walks up the street with sympathy not that i dont like her shes a very lovely person but who can tell
a year from now you might thank your stars that it turned out this way
changing the subject by the way robard said that
steve his manner full of pain stops
frank i dont want to make the benefit
theyll be jammin all night and the way i feel id like to be alone id like just to walk and walk and never come back
dangelo takes him firmly by the arm
i dont leave you alone on a night like this
and anyway you promised
steve looks at him knowing that he can never shake off the devoted frank he shrugs
they walk past camera
the heavy brass doors of the elevator slide open and the elevator man pulls open the grille
susan still in the mood in which steve left her stands in the elevator for a moment before she realizes that she has reached the top floor
as she walks out the elevator man looks at her anxiously
camera pans with susan towards the door to the apartment
susan fumbles for her key
the apartment is dark as susan enters
she does not switch on the lights
she walks through the shadows of the big room which has a grim and menacing atmosphere
she kicks off her shoes and hugging the coat about her for warmth walks to the glass windows of the terrace
after a moment she opens them and steps out
susan walks across the terrace
at this height the wind is very strong
camera tracks with the girl emphasizing the dizzying panorama of new york at night
the girls manner is strange she moves as if under compulsion a sleepwalker
when she reaches the stone parapet she leans against it with her body slumped still hugging the fur coat as if it were some protection against her misery
from susans point of view
the stone sidewalks of broadway are a terrifying distance below
an angle shooting sharply upwards against the night sky
wind blows the girls hair as she looks fixedly downwards
her face is blank expressionless
for a moment we may fear for her afraid that she may have suicide in mind
but presently she lifts her head looking towards the horizon
camera shoots past the entrance to robards club framing the outline of the bridge in sky in background
from inside comes the sound of music the quintet
the taxi drives up sidney gets out he glances at his wristwatch looks around and then makes his way into the club
steve dallas quintet on the stand
camera frames the group in foreground shooting towards the entrance way
sidney has come in through the entrance
he is taking off his overcoat
he moves forward past the hat check room on the left approaching the recess in which several music cases are stacked beside a coat rack on which the musicians overcoats
as he hangs up his coat sidney identifies the other coat a black and white check raglan which he and we saw steve wearing when he visited hunsecker at the
a close shot
the coat appears to have some significance for him sidney is under tension
a waiter carrying a carton of beer cans comes out of the doorway just behind sidney moving between him and the overcoat
thus interrupted sidney turns away
robard is standing at the bar surrounded by a group of his cronies
drink is flowing and there is a sentimental mood of celebration
as sidney arrives at the bar ordering a drink frank dangelo is seen coming from the interior of the club where dallas and the quintet can be seen playing dangelo
accosts robard lew steve dont feel too good
interjecting im sorry to hear it
camera shoots past dangelo and robard in f
towards sidney who overhears continuing so if you dont mind hell leave after this set
sidney sets down his drink reacting to this information
robard clamps dangelo on the shoulder reassuring him with warm emphasis i like that boy frank
anything he does is okay with me
sidney thinking rapidly leaves the bar moving unobtrusively but purposefully towards a telephone booth
he enters and closes the door
a closer angle
shooting through the glass panel we see sidney dialing
his manner is urgent
a long shot of the club exterior
a different musical number is now being played in the interior
a black car comes swiftly under the bridge turns into the little square opposite the club braking sharply
as the car comes to a stop camera shoots across the hood onto the windshield where we see the insignia police
the occupants of the car are not visible
sidney lingers near the doorway of the club
he is looking across the square towards the car which can be seen in b
now he turns and walks towards the coat rack camera tracking with him
he takes his own coat and as he thrusts his arm into the sleeve contrives neatly to slip some unseen object into the pocket of steves overcoat camera notes the
gesture but only very briefly
overscene a voice addresses sidney hey
a close up
as he turns in swift apprehension we note the moment of panic in his face
camera shoots past sidney in foreground towards dangelo who advances on sidney
dangelos manner is unfriendly for an instant we feel like sidney that dangelo may have seen sidney tampering with steves coat but then we are reassured as dangelo deliberately using
sidneys surname says continuing mr
i hate to give you this satisfaction they broke it off tonight for good
shooting across dangelo onto sidney who now relaxes his fears ungrounded
continuing tell that to hunsecker tell him we agree hes a big man he wins all the marbles
as dangelo moves away again sidney looks after him
once more his face goes tense
he asks himself does this development which he himself anticipated change the situation
he turns away moving out of shot
camera moves with sidney as he walks towards the doorway
there he hesitates again he looks back into the club
from sidneys viewpoint
a long shot of steve on the bandstand
camera pans deliberately towards the coatrack in f
a group of newly arrived musicians walk into the shot setting down their instrument cases and starting to hang up their coats
clearly sidney could not now return to the coat rack even if he decided that he did want to undo his handiwork
camera shooting out across the square frames sidney in f
facing the inevitable sidney turns away walks across the sidewalk
on the other side of the square the headlamps of the car blink twice
sidney walks towards it
a big man gets out of the seat next to the driver
as he comes round the hood of the car the headlamps of a passing truck illuminate him identifying harry kello
camera pans as he walks to meet sidney
kello pauses as sidney comes up to him asks affably whats all the rush
you said three oclock
glancing back towards club hes leaving early
after this set
hell be out in a couple of minutes
they wait for a moment listening to the sound of the music in the distance
it is a blues number goodbye baby kello hums nonchalantly sidney glances at him with irritation finding something gruesome in his relaxed manner
there are two plainclothes policemen inside one at the wheel the other in the back seat
the latter leans forward to ask the former whats this deal tonight
the nd policeman one of the lieutenants surprise parties i think
murphs tone shows obvious repugnance
the st policeman broods for a moment he adds in a quiet but viciously resentful manner one of these days id like to turn in my badge and tangle with
popsie myself hes no good
sidney increasingly uncomfortable turns to kello
cant you wait up the block
its not going to look so good right in front of the club
to kello this is a great joke
he laughs enjoying sidneys uneasiness
he begins to cat and mouse sidney
heavily humorous its nice sidney that you give me this tip
interjecting hes got them on him
solemnly nodding his approval and hes got them on him
i appreciate a thing like that i appreciate where you are looking out for the virtue of the city
sidney annoyed at this sarcasm moves past kello not deigning to respond
as he goes by kello grasps him forcibly by the arm
whats your hurry snooks
camera has panned to shoot towards the car out of which emerges a second detective
revolted take your hands off kello
kello holding sidney turns towards the second detective in background
murph how do you like this face
why ill be darned its melting
something got you scared sidney
listen rectify me a certain thing
wasnt you kidding snooks when you told j
i was fat
sidney jerks his arm away rapidly retreats a few yards a safe distance from kello
camera pans with him to the bottom of the steps
sleep in peace kello youre skinny but j
says you sweat
sidney in foreground kello and murph beyond
kello laughs but obviously he would like to be nearer to sidney
perhaps to detain sidney kello drawls is that a fact
hes a dilly aint he
by the by what did he have against this boy
he goes out with girls
well ill be darned
and what does j
think he should do
impudently go out with different girls
he moves forward a little
softly now i get the peculiar impression snooks that you dont like me
could i be wrong
he turns swiftly and goes up the stairs out of kellos reach
as he goes you could be right you fat slob
from half way up the stairs
sidney comes up the steps two at a time
kello and murphy are seen beyond
with a guffaw come back here sidney
i wanna chastise you
sidney reaches the top
he comes along the pedestrian walk up to camera slowing down he turns across the rail and looks down towards the square
camera moves to take in the scene in wide angle sidney in foreground the police car and detectives below the entrance to robards across the square
in the distance we can hear the music of dallas last number coming to an end
the last bars of the number
he responds to the ovation nicely but a little wearily
he gets down off the stand
there is too much noise to hear his parting words to his fellow musicians but it is clear that he is urging them to stay without him
he walks off towards the entrance to the club
dangelo leaves the bar in search of steve
steve is putting his guitar away in the case collecting his overcoat
in this gesture he is arrested by the sound of dangelos voice over scene
steve mildly startled looks up
shooting into the club
dangelo comes forward from the bar
he is a little drunk a little emotional
he waddles toward steve then takes the white carnation out of his buttonhole and puts it in the buttonhole of steves coat saying fondly press this in your friendship book
love is a crooked thing friendship not
then sheepishly you see it comes out in the wash of a few drinks im a very sentimental guy
steve is touched
i like it that way frank
he picks up his guitar case and makes for the door
dangelo goes a few paces with him camera tracking
then it moves past dangelo following steve out onto the sidewalk where he stands under the light of the club framed against the dark background of the square
camera pans from the small figure of steve to include sidney big in foreground
below him kello and murph turn towards the club
closer angle downward from sidneys viewpoint
kello turns deliberately to look at the bridge above
sidney sees kellos look he nods deliberately
below him we see kello and murphy move swiftly to get into the car
sidney as if shrinking from a sight from which he doesnt wish to witness draws back from the balustrade
he turns and begins to walk towards camera
a low angle shooting upwards at the car the stairs to the bridge in background
as the doors of the car slam it starts to move forward and abruptly its headlamps are switched on glaring into the lens
steve concerned only with his only melancholy thoughts walks down the sidewalk under the bridge
the car headlamps illuminate him in their glare as they move across him
steve without undue interest glances back but continues on his way
camera shoots eastward towards the silhouette of the bridge
the police car turns as it comes out of the square under the bridge towards camera
it moves slowly again its headlamps flare into the lens
camera pulling back includes steve in foreground
behind him the police car slows down at the curb it barely stops as kello slips out of the off side door then the car moves forward along the curb
leaving him behind steve
as the car goes out of picture past camera kello strolls across the sidewalk following steve
steve looking past camera notices
camera shoots toward nd avenue
the police car slows down again at the curb and murph gets out of it turning to face steve
steve seeing the man ahead of him notes something slightly menacing in his manner and slows down in his walk
then instinctively he realizes that there is a second man behind him turns to look at kello
camera moves closer and closer on steve
in his face we see a growing sense of something wrong
a jump cut
loud noise chico hamilton on the drums
another jump cut in the sound track
it is an empty saloon occupied only by a solitary drinker at one end of the long bar nursing a beer and by the bartender who is making out a
sidney enters strides to the bar and throws down a jangling half dollar
a bunch of nickels mister
while the change is made sidney stands with cocked head listening in reality or imagination to what is happening down the street
as the barman supplies the change sidney goes to the juke box and loads it with nickels saying over his shoulder a double johnny walker black
or whatever you got
sidney puts both hands on the juke box as if leaning on it
with a click drop and whirl the music box comes to life music blares out
pausing a moment sidney turns back toward the bar
he reaches for his drink downs it
he is shivering
once more an abrupt sound transition the jam session at full blast
camera frames the musicians in foreground but moves away from them towards the entrance in background
near the doorway there is some activity an attendant beckons to robard who is drinking with dangelo
robard moves toward the entrance
camera starts on dangelo at the bar
he looks off after robard
there is little concern in his face but as he watches curiosity grows
he strolls out after the proprietor
camera tracks with him as dangelo comes to join the little mob of two or three people on the sidewalk
panning the camera now shoots towards nd avenue
beyond the bridge we can see the police car
kello and murphy are beside one of the open doors into which steve has been carried
murphy turns back walks a few paces across the sidewalk and picks up steves music case which he carries back to the squad car
he gets in and the car drives off
hey robard somebody just picked up one of your boys
what sa wha dangelos face shows a bewildered astonishment and dismay as he turns back to the couple of people who are talking to robard
dangelo is a little befuddled with drink
he pushes towards robard
dazed whatsa matter lou
turning to dangelo im trying to find out myself
they just picked up steve
blankly some fat guy
a cop a couple of cops
they smeared him all over the lot
he turns to look back towards the direction in which the police car has departed
he seems unable to comprehend what he has heard but a slow and terrible fear is dawning on him
susan opens the door to discover frank dangelo in lobby
he speaks at once im looking for your brother
is he home
sensing the seriousness of his manner mr
dangelo is something wrong
dangelo has no wish to become involved with the girl he doesnt reply
when does he usually gets in your night owl brother
seldom before five
again whats the matter
would you care to come in a minute
dangelo backs away shaking his head
he turns back to the elevator
susan closes the door but slowly she is watching dangelo
camera moves with dangelo as he goes to the bell of the elevator and rings it
he remains in this position waiting for the elevator but now believing himself to be alone he leans his head against the wall and begins to weep quietly
surprisingly susan is abruptly at his elbow she seizes him forcibly by the arm demanding taut somethings happened
dangelo with his face contorted in grief and bitterness can no longer refuse to answer her
in a broken voice hes in the hospital
hes under arrest too
they planted reefer cigarettes on him
in his overcoat pocket
susan is becoming hysterical
wildly where is he
i want to go to him
dangelo recovers his self control
there is force and authority in his voice as he insists miss hunsecker if you see him again they might
might kill him
susan is sobered by his seriousness
slowly who is they
dont ask foolish questions
then tell your brother im a sensible man
he understands only two things power politics and homage tell him i came tonight to pay homage
the elevator door opens and sidney steps out he crosses to the door of the apartment pushes the button
the bell is heard ringing inside
while he waits sidney produces a handkerchief dabs his face straightens his tie clearly he is trying to sober up
he goes to the bell push to ring again
now he notices something that had escaped him before the door is not quite shut
he pushes it open
sidney hesitates enters tentatively
the apartment appears empty
only one light is lit the place is eerie
sidney closes the door goes into the main living room camera pans with him
something chills him he calls softly j
sidney walks towards the study there is nobody there either
he goes back towards the stairs to the upper floor in doing so he repasses the door of susans bedroom sees that it is half open goes to look in
from sidneys viewpoint
the bed has been slept in but is unoccupied
the room is empty
on the seat at the foot of the bed is a drawer that has been pulled out of the wardrobe it contains a collection of miscellaneous objects a snapshot album
letters souvenirs disarranged as if someone had been looking at them
he looks at the empty room disturbed
the curtains of the window onto the terrace are blowing the window is open
sidney walks into shot form behind camera
he calls susan
susan steps into the room from the terrace confronting sidney
she is dressed wearing the fur coat over a skirt and blouse
her manner is very strange the effect of the drugs no doubt
sidney is very uncomfortable in her presence susan is the last person he wants to have conversation with
he retreats across the threshold of the bedroom into the outer room
she walks forwards
he isnt here
sidney stands back to let her pass
but he called and said
susan comes out of the bedroom walks past camera
no i called
he studies the girl says nothing
she walks listlessly across the room moving like a somnambulist
dangelo phoned about steve
i went down to the hospital but they wouldnt let me in
he promised to keep in touch with me mr
dangelo i mean
he watches her cautiously not sure of how to deal with her
carefully its all over town about dallas
moving towards her how is he
a close up
susans expression is blank her eyes are unseeing
there is a tone of great despair in her voice
presently she recovers camera eases back to include sidney beyond
she glances at him
i gave steve up
then why did you and j
sidney looks at her tensely
her voice is so calm so certain that sidney finds it difficult to play act innocence
he protests a little too loudly susie if i get your meaning youre pitching very wild balls
what susan interrupts with a simplicity which is damaging
dont bother to lie sidney
moving away i dont care anymore
sidney decides that it is wiser not to argue
he assumes a tolerant sympathy
he moves towards her
listen get a good nights sleep tomorrows another day
feeling sorry for yourself wont help
shaking her head im sorry about steve not myself
im even sorry for my brother
to be so lonely without one real friend in the world to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because shes his only real
family moving towards her again come on now chickie why dont you go to bed
now she turns to him
and im sorry for you too sidney
youre going down with the ship
she walks past him still aimlessly wandering about the room then she turns back indicates herself
she studies sidney
dont you know how my brother will see you after tonight
youll be the man who drove his little stainless sister to suicide
shaken sidney decides to ridicule the implied threat
honey ill just have to smile at that
he walks past camera
sidney walks into shot going past her on his way to the door
as he goes its late and im going home
susan in foreground remains quite still says nothing
in background sidney slows down his confidence failing him he looks back at her
he cant go
probably shes bluffing
but he cant be certain
he is suddenly angry
he strides back towards her
susie whatever problems you have with j
i didnt invent them
whatre you blaming me for
if you learned to let out your hatred you would be better off
i dont choke on my own gall i fight back
let them choke not me
im not a man sidney im i know that bit youre a girl you need a man to give you strength
so what do you pick such weak sisters for
dont you know yet that you fight fire with fire not with tear drops
i could almost forgive you if what you did to steve came from jealousy and love
quickly i didnt do anything
but you did it for greed sidney and thats pathetic
she moves past him
he grips her turning her around
dont run away i was always the man for you
im talking to you out of two years of silence listen to what i say
inside of six months helplessly please sidney i cant stand this camera holds sidney and susan in foreground
but it is now shooting towards the door of the apartment
a panning movement has included a figure at the other end of the big room
he is taking off his overcoat near the door of the apartment
we dont know how long he has been there how much he has overheard
without appearing to be consciously spying hunsecker is listening to sidneys voice over scene
over scene listen to me lunatic
all your life youve been doing penance for crimes you never committed
i could change that id teach you id show you
camera pans round with hunsecker who strolls across the room making his presence known
sidney breaks off drops his hands releasing the girl
susan turns towards hunsecker
hunsecker lays his briefcase and papers on the table
he addresses susan without looking at her
go to bed susie
susan makes no move
hunsecker glances at her sees sidney but treats sidney as if he were invisible
to susan what is he doing here
susan walks towards hunsecker
i called him
sidney moves forward also
carefully she was depressed she heard about dallas
hunsecker still ignores his existence he walks past susan carrying his papers to the desk
susan turns watching him
controlling his feelings that subject it might be better not to start me on
angry hes made all the papers tonight
hunsecker studies the item in the paper
she is staring at her brother
suddenly she is unable to suffer his authoritative air she goes to him he ignores her
childishly she snatches the paper from his hand throws it to the floor
he looks at her
patiently as with a hysterical infant he stoops recovers the paper
mildly is there something you wanted to say
as she does not answer continuing with growing viciousness ive put up with a lot of your guff susie because you were a child
but youre a woman now and i suspect despite my best intentions more than a bit of a slut
her head comes up sharply at the insult
hunsecker glances at sidney clearly reminding them of the compromising situation in which they were found
sidney moves to answer
if you think cutting in dont explain sidney
it doesnt matter now
continuing whose arms will i have to pry you out of next
not that i dont think you didnt invite it
i know that look of yours that pose of being wronged and how it arouses the crusading instinct in even a sidney falco hunseckers rising tide of brutality is having
some effect on susan and sidney fearing for her tries to intervene
i was trying to build her up not tear her down viciously is that why you were romancing her you mutt
turning back to susan lets call it quits my dear
id like it fine if you found another home
that means the front door is open
pack your things rent a moving van and git
pacing the room and as for marriage let me hit you with a few choice facts you arent ready for marriage
youre incompetent a capricious and shaky frail with a sick fatality for frail and useless men
susan is staring sightlessly at the floor near hunseckers feet
after a moment she turns and moves to the door of her bedroom her walk is a little unsteady she goes inside closes the door in hunseckers face
with the door closed she leans against it as if afraid of falling
she gropes for the door handle finds the key and turns it
hunsecker is studying the closed door
to himself another crisis past
walking away shell be fast asleep in five minutes loaded with those headache pills
sidney seems not to hear this remark
he is concentrated on the door he moves hesitantly towards it apprehensive
camera includes hunsecker in background
now well get to you sidney
turning to sidney as far as the column is concerned tonight you have forfeited every ethical consideration i ever felt for you
much more concerned with his anxiety for susan sidney interrupts
cutting in look j
ill grant you anything you want
as hunsecker is about to interrupt susies off her rocker tonight
go in and see what shes doing
go in and talk to her quietly unless you want a corpse
sidneys conviction is impressive
but hunsecker is unwilling to admit the danger he continues
acid let me finish what i started to say seeing that hunsecker is not taking his advice sidney strides swiftly to the door of susans bedroom
he knocks on it
shooting towards the door
susan is sitting on the bed in foreground
in a methodical hypnotic way she is destroying the contents of the drawer tearing letters into small fragments
sidneys voice is heard outside susie
susan appears not to hear it camera tracks closer to her
sidneys voice is heard again louder susie
susan turns sharply towards the door
a close up
susan rises to her feet staring at the door
she begins to back away from it
camera pulls back as susan glances down at the record player beside her
she turns the knob
we hear the clatter of a record dropping and music begins
the tune is the sage
close shot of sidney
he hears the music starting
hunsecker has come forward
but now as he listens to the gramaphone record playing in the bedroom hunsecker relaxes assuming that this is a sign that sidneys suspicions are unfounded
coming forward what a cornball you are sidney
camera tracks to include sidney
he does not share hunseckers confidence he knocks again calling anxiously susie
in growing fear camera tracks closer to sidney
as he tries the doorknob camera tilts down
sidneys hand tries the doorknob finds it locked shakes it forcefully
from inside the bedroom
we see the doorknob rattled
a close up
she realizes that sidney means to insist
she turns away towards the blowing curtains in background
a detail shot
sidneys hand is still shaking the doorknob
he releases it
camera pulls back to a two shot of sidney and hunsecker as sidney retreats from the door in apprehension
now hunsecker has begun to share sidneys anxiety
he moves to the door knocks and then pounds on it
with authority susie this is j
a close up
she comes forward past the blowing curtains
the wind whips at her hair
over scene we hear the rumble of the traffic on broadway far below
he is pounding on the door again
camera makes a quick pan to sidney who in a split second realizes that susan may have gone out on the balcony
he turns dashes towards the study to look out on the terrace
she has now started to climb onto the parapet
sidney leaps into shot dragging her bodily off the parapet and out of shot
we hear susan cry out a hysterical gasp
camera looking through the windows of susans bedroom sees the door fly open as hunsecker bursts into the room
he looks swiftly around advances towards the open window
exasperated by the sound of the gramaphone he switches it off he steps out onto the terrace
camera pans with him as he turns to look back into the study where susans inanimate figure is sprawled on the floor half across the low upholstered footstool
sidney white and shaking is standing over her
camera at floor level
susan is framed in foreground
the lower half of sidney can be seen beside her
hunsecker is on the terrace in background
shocked he moves quickly into the room
a close up
he looks down at his sister
he is badly shaken
the sharp bite of terror produces a reaction of something akin to anger
but he swiftly controls it
he moves past camera
hunsecker stoops into shot
tenderly he lifts the girls body to get it into the arm chair
susan is quite lifeless limp with the dead weight of a creature that has lost any instinct for self preservation
but as she feels her brothers arms and as she recognizes who it is she breaks out in hysteria
dont touch me
but susan strikes at him a vicious gesture of revulsion
hunsecker lets her go
she falls into the arm chair her face hidden from him she begins to sob
her body shaking go away
hunsecker would like to comfort her but he dare not touch her again for fear of inviting another rebuff
he is deeply hurt and wounded
embarrassed that sidney should watch this moment hunsecker rises
to cover his emotion he walks to the tray of drinks in background he pours a brandy and comes back
stooping he offers it to susan
her only reaction is again to wrench herself away from him facing the opposite direction
sobbing bitterly hunsecker sets down the drink stands up
in a choked voice talk to her sidney
hushed talk to her yourself
over scene the telephone rings
it is ignored
while hunsecker looks down at the girl helplessly the telephone continues to ring
a close up
it is she who first becomes aware of the telephone
her weeping has stopped now
slowly she raises her head
camera eases back to include sidney beyond her he notes this movement seeing in it a revival of the girls will to live he is moved
the telephone is framed in foreground susan beyond
it continues to ring
as hunsecker crosses to his desk to pick up the instrument camera pulls back
hunsecker speaks yuh
he listens just a minute
turning back to susan susie its mr
dangelo from the hospital
a close shot
she raises her head higher still weakly
we see in her face a mixture of terror and hope
hunsecker comes forward to set down the telephone in front of her on the footstool
hunsecker and sidney watch
she reaches a hand which is still trembling picks up the receiver
her voice as she speaks to the instrument is barely audible
presently she hangs up
when she becomes aware that hunsecker and sidney are waiting for an explanation she tells them speaking with difficulty steve
is out of danger
he already knows this
then soberly that means a lot to you
she does not look at him she lowers her eyes but answers with a nod
and then more positively yes
he studies the girl
his face has hardened
he moves beginning to pace
and also beginning his manipulations
but i have to warn you susie for your own sake hell still do time
camera follows hunsecker
it now takes in sidney who is standing beside him
sidney has begun to stare fixedly at hunsecker
he is now realizing that hunsecker although he has been faced with this demonstration of the girls willingness to kill herself has still learned nothing is still continuing in the
continuing warming to his theme hes a hop head thats a felony in new york
i can try of course to
a close up
revolted sidney breaks in youre unholy j
youd rather kill this girl than let her go
hunsecker wheels on sidney bellowing in blind rage sidney with equal heat spins round to susan crying out before he has time to check himself impulsively susie you get out
of this house
get out before its too late
sidney has gone too far now to pull back
inevitably he continues
during the speech camera pulls back to include susan and then hunsecker
with sincerity listen with care this will cost me everything so you know im telling you the truth
trying to stop him youre incapable of the truth
who will not by stopped susie theres nothing wrong with dallas
turning toward hunsecker your brother and i arranged it all
and if the leslie boy is still a squooshy item in your life forget it
your brother arranged that one too
i dont usually give away presents but this is my gift to you get out of here
leave this man
during the latter part of the speech susan rises slowly to her feet staring first at sidney and then with fearful significance at her brother
hunsecker does not look at her he is concentrated on sidney
twice he has been about to demolish sidney but he now stops a thought in his head
he is perfectly controlled smiling
like most italians sidneys got a big gift for dramatics
i however prefer the cool and stubborn facts
sidney has not appeared in my column in weeks check that fact with mary
that leads right to another fact sidney had nothing to lose tonight
to the contrary dear only his obvious greed to in brief blackmail
hunsecker pauses impressively
framing hunsecker in foreground susan and sidney beyond
susan listens to hunsecker objectively with a mounting sense of his diseased reasoning
continuing mind you not that one true fact didnt come out of sidneys mouth tonight self admittedly he committed a vicious crime of jealousy against steve dallas
pausing now we have to clear dallas dont we
but ill have to sacrifice him
he indicates sidney to do it
turning to susan am i doing right
she is looking at hunsecker
over scene yes or no susie
slowly susan nods
shooting across susan onto hunsecker
hunsecker turns away from her and walks to the telephone
he picks it up and begins to speak
while the scene continues we hear his voice off screen speaking to the phone saying this is j
i want you to get a message through to lieutenant kello
ask him to ring me back
susan backs slowly away from hunsecker
then she turns into camera which tracks with her and includes sidney
susan looks at sidney and then ashamed avoids his eye
but sidney comes nearer to her
susan is deeply distressed
very quietly hes sick
she looks again at sidney
deliberately sidney nods
susan walks toward her bedroom
susan comes into the room finding shelter from the revelation which has so appalled her
inexorably sidney follows her
he comes across the threshold closes the door
quietly yes hes sick and youre the only idiot alive who didnt know it
sidney moves closer to her
but what are you going to do
there are some tears of pity in susans eyes
once more she moves away from sidney
sidney senses that her compassion for hunsecker might easily lead her once again to slip back into the trap
he insists with emphasis you dont owe your brother a cup of water
sidney again repeats what are you going to do
she moves away from sidney camera following her
after a moment she answers go to steve
sidney is moved having done his solitary act of chivalry
to hide his feelings he is harsh sharply for petes sake straighten out the seams of your stockings comb your hair dont be so helpless all the time
camera pulls back to include susan
from the other room we hear the telephone ring
sidney turns and goes quickly out
after a moment susan looks back at the door through which sidney has disappeared
hunsecker is framed in foreground speaking into the telephone
sidney is in background outside the door of susans bedroom
hunsecker is fully aware of sidneys presence as he says to phone no hes admitted that harry
my kid sisters a witness
a close shot
he watches hunsecker with a curious detachment
producing a cigarette he lights it and then looks up towards hunsecker
over scene no he admits he planted the stuff on the dallas boy
hunsecker framed in foreground sidney beyond
hunsecker has at the same time been tapping a cigarette on the desk
sidney walks across to hunsecker offers the lighted match
as he accepts the light he continues speaking to the phone yeah
sidney turns on his heel walking out of the apartment
continuing hes been trying to make my sister behind my back
kello is in a phone booth
to phone oh thats serious j
kello leans out of the booth into the cafe signaling through the window to the street outside where the squad car pulls ahead to a position ready for him outside
to phone dont worry ill get there
im on broadway now
kello hangs up
we see him get into the squad car which rapidly accelerates
hunsecker has hung up
he stares at the telephone for a moment
then he moves towards susans door camera tracking with him
he comes to the threshold looks at susan who is standing in much the same position in which sidney left her
unaware that her brother is watching her she picks up the fur coat on the bed
she is about to start packing her belongings
she turns as she hears hunsecker speak
over scene thats a pretty coat
shooting across susan towards hunsecker
hunsecker comes into the room
continuing but its about time you had a new one
susan turns squarely to face him
she braces herself to tell him soberly im leaving j
he does not sense any danger in the seriousness of her tone or if he does refuses to recognize it
with a faint scoff dont kid a kidder
ill see you for breakfast around eleven
without waiting for a response hunsecker goes out closing the door
susan stares at it for a moment
then she moves to get a small suitcase which she lays on the bed
hunsecker opens the windows onto the terrace comes out and looks over the parapet looking to see how far sidney has got hoping to see kellos squad car
she completes her simple packing closing the suitcase
with a gesture that is obviously automatic she starts to put on the fur coat then she halts realizing what she is doing
she pauses camera moves closer
now deliberately she throws the coat back on the bed
camera pans down with the gesture
she looks down at the coat the discarded symbol of her dependence upon her brother
camera pulls back again as she takes a quick look round then goes to take a duffle coat from the wardrobe
she throws this over her arm picks up the suitcase goes to the door
susan comes out of the door
she moves with a sober determination expecting to find hunsecker in the room
camera tracks with her
but then she realizes that hunsecker has gone out on the terrace
she takes a step or two towards him then pauses
from susans viewpoint shooting through the big glass windows
hunsecker is at the parapet
he is impatiently looking down into broadway
a close up
she now realizes that there is no point in saying goodbye to him she has already told him that she is leaving and if she becomes involved in further argument
with him it can do no good
yet there is some emotion on her face as she takes a last look at her brother she turns away
framing him in foreground at the parapet
susan can be seen through the windows before she disappears to the door
hunsecker reacts as he catches sight of a vehicle on broadway below
the squad car comes down broadway at speed
sidney is walking across the square
the squad car appears in foreground it pauses hardly at all as kello slips out of it and starts to move after sidney
then the car accelerates round duffy square to cut sidney off on the other side
sidney comes up towards camera
seeing something ahead he halts
from sidneys viewpoint
the car breaks to a stop
its door opens and a detective gets out slowly
it is phil
sidney is framed in foreground the squad car beyond
sidney knows what this means
he starts to speak before he turns to look over his shoulder
kello moving silently up behind sidney slows down amused at sidneys prescience
coming to join sidney i just been on the phone to j
kellos manner is almost affectionate
he shakes his head admonishing sidney
mildly you been a bad boy sidney
s going to write about you in his column tomorrow
shooting across kello onto sidney
sidneys smile is tired
i thought he would
then and another thing hes gonna say you resisted arrest
as sidney nods you know j
sidney turns away to look back towards phil
then taking kello totally by surprise he wheels striking the cop viciously across the mouth
kellos head jerks back
recovering at once he guffaws lurches into camera with a sudden vicious movement
there is a sharp guttural cry over scene
phil runs forward towards the figures of sidney and kello seen beyond him
in doing so he blocks the view so that we do not clearly see the violence with which kello strikes sidney down
phil in foreground is seen to relax
when he moves aside clearing the view sidney is writhing on the ground at kellos feet
kello wipes his knuckles on his handkerchief
he signals to phil to help lift the body at his feet
phil enters shot and they raise sidney half carrying half dragging him out of shot
the cops carry the figure of sidney falco across duffy square they bundle him into the police car
the pigeons in the square circle
camera looks down towards duffy square in the distance
the police car can be seen moving off circling the square and disappearing southward on broadway
camera pulls back to include hunsecker in foreground
a close shot shooting sharply upward at hunsecker
he looks down quiet impassively and there is a slightly insane grandeur a paranoiac superiority in the way that he turns back dismissing sidney from his thoughts
camera shoots towards the closed door of susans room
hunsecker walks into the shot stops before the door
he begins to take off his tie and unbutton his shirt clearly preparing to go to bed
as an after thought he comes back to the door addresses it gently susie
getting no answer are you in bed
camera moves closer
it is at a low level still emphasizing the mans dignity
he strolls for a few paces
continuing i dont have to tell you of course that i cleared your boyfriends name i didnt let you down
camera has now moved so that we are shooting past hunsecker onto susans door
he gets no answer except silence
a close shot reverse angle
we now see in his face a flicker of fear
with what is clearly an effort he reassumes a confident manner
i was saving this news for breakfast but i think ill jump the gun
im gonna give you and still no answer from inside the bedroom
hunseckers forced expression remains unnaturally fixed upon his face
he calls out susie
the room is quite empty
camera shoots across the bed towards the door in background
susans discarded fur coat lies on the bed
and the doors of the wardrobe are open
hunseckers voice can be heard continuing over scene outside im getting the mayor to perform the ceremony and no i think ill fly the governor down from albany
a pause do you hear
then very tentatively the bedroom door is opened
outside are you listening
now he opens the door and comes in
a big close up
the sight of the empty room freezes his face for a moment
his eyes look round
from hunseckers viewpoint
a panning shot from the open door of the cupboard to the fur coat
camera pulls back to include hunsecker
he steps to the bed picks up the coat
there is a dazed incredulous look on his face
but as he glances over his shoulder camera zooms past him towards a little door in the wall behind him it is ajar showing a couple of inches of light
once again hunsecker reassures himself that susan must be behind the door
but his voice is even more false as he declares a note of anger appearing in his voice susie
you wont threaten me
nobody walks out on j
camera now moves closer and closer to hunsecker
the angle is a weird one tilting grotesquely upward
continuing you need me you all need me
hunsecker his fists clenching fiercely at the fur coat walks towards the door
camera pans with him
he stands a few inches from the narrow opening
he seems about to push the door open further but is afraid to do so
camera shoots across the bathtub showing enough of the tiny room to make it clear that it too is completely empty
through the slit in the door we can see only a glimpse of the movement of hunsecker outside
hunseckers voice continues the lord is my shepherd i shall not want
a sneering laugh thats bunk in a book
im the shepherd of millions of little men and women
a downward angle shooting past hunsecker to the door
as hunsecker retreats from the door he is still clutching the fur coat
he stands alone in the middle of the room and his gestures are a little wild
camera rises higher to shoot down at hunsecker alone in the little room
continuing i dont ask them to get on their knees but they come to me for advice and guidance
who are you to reject me
with an increasingly eccentric manner hunsecker strides out of the bedroom door into the living room again
a similar angle shooting down on hunsecker as he comes out of the bedroom
but as he starts to roam the vast room camera rises higher still pulling backwards and upwards to a long shot which holds the entirety of the big room in
all its ugliness
continuing what makes you fit to sit in judgment on a man like me
only a great person understands another great person and that leaves you out
hunsecker is now addressing the whole of the apartment no longer pretending even to himself that the girl is still listening
he moves off towards the windows to the terrace where the curtains are now blowing in the morning wind
he goes out towards the terrace his voice becoming more distant a man shouting empty nonsense addressing no one
continuing that leaves you all out
youre all sick weak midgets
im proud to be alone
camera shoots steeply up towards the top of the brill bldg
at this angle hunseckers terrace will not be visible but its position is established in relationship to the budweiser sign
camera pans down to pick up the figure of susan hunsecker as she pushes her way out of the brass doors onto broadway
susan pauses on the sidewalk
she stays there for a moment
she breathes in the fresh morning air looking around with the expression of someone who sees the world with new eyes
then she starts up broadway away from the times square area
the girls step has a purpose in it she has confidence and courage
music for the end titles is quiet simple and lyrical
