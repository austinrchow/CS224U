b if window
href b b blade runner by hampton fancher screenplay by july brighton productions inc
beachwood drive hollywood calif
its magnified and deeply revealed
flecks of green and yellow in a field of milky blue
icy filaments surround the undulating center
the eye is brown in a tiny screen
on the metallic surface below the words voight kampff are finely etched
theres a touch light panel across the top and on the side of the screen a dial that registers fluctuations of the iris
the instrument is no bigger than a music box and sits on a table between two men
the man talking is big looks like an over stuffed kid
leon it says on his breast pocket
hes dressed in a warehousemans uniform and his pudgy hands are folded expectantly in his lap
despite the obvious heat he looks very cool
the man facing him is lean hollow cheeked and dressed in gray
detached and efficient he looks like a cop or an accountant
his name is holden and hes all business except for the sweat on his face
the room is large and humid
rows of salvaged junk are stacked neatly against the walls
two large fans whir above their heads
okay if i talk
holden doesnt answer
hes centering leons eye on the machine
i kinda get nervous when i take tests
he tries not to move but finally his lips cant help a sheepish smile
already had i
test this year but i dont think i never had a
cutting in reaction time is a factor in this so please pay attention
answer quickly as you can
leon compresses his lips and nods his big head eagerly
holdens voice is cold geared to intimidate and evoke response
youre in a desert walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down and see a
it was a timid interruption hardly audible
doesnt make any difference what desert its completely hypothetical
but how come id be there
maybe youre fed up maybe you want to be by yourself who knows
so you look down and see a tortoise
its crawling towards you
know what a turtle is
i never seen a turtle
he sees holdens patience is wearing thin
but i understand what you mean
you reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back leon
keeping an eye on his subject holden notes the dials in the voight kampff
one of the needles quivers slightly
you make these questions mr
holden or they write em down for you
disregarding the question holden continues picking up the pace
the tortoise lays on its back its belly baking in the hot sun beating its legs trying to turn itself over
but it cant
not without your help
but youre not helping
leons upper lip is quivering
whatcha mean im not helping
i mean youre not helping
why is that leon
leon looks shocked surprised
but the needles in the computer barely move
holden goes for the inside of his coat
but big leon is faster
his laser burns a hole the size of a nickel through holdens stomach
unlike a bullet a laser causes no impact
it goes through holdens spine and comes out his back clean as a whistle
like a rag doll he falls back off the bench from the waist up
by the time he hits the floor big slow leon is already walking away
but he stops turns and with a little smile of satisfaction fires at the machine on the table
theres a flash and a puff of smoke
the voight kampff is hit dead center crippled but not destroyed as leon walks out of the room one of its lights begins to blink faint but steady
the horizon marked by a thin copper line that maybe the end of the beginning of a day
the train that follows cuts through the night at miles an hour
no clickitty clack of track bound noise its a long insulated pullman of contoured seats and low keyed lighting coloured to soothe and empty except for the passenger half way
his eyes closed head rested against the glass
ten years ago deckard might have been an athlete a track man or a welter weight
the body looks it but the face has seen some time not all of it good
deckard comes down the aisle slips a coin into the mechanism receives a beer and returns to his seat
tired of the program he takes off the headset and drops it next to three empty beer bottles and a sandwich wrapper adjusts his position and winds up staring at
his reflection in the window
runs a hand over his face it could use a shave
he leans closer and peers through the glass
out there in the black a sign flashes past san the train slides in smooth as an eel and stops with out a sound
carrying a bag and umbrella deckard disembarks ahead of the other passengers and into the sweltering night
deckard has got his coat swung over his shoulder his shirt already damp as he walks down the long hollow passage under orbs of yellow light
deckard unlocks his car and gets in
turns the ig nition and hits a sensor
the dash console glows and deckard sits back waiting for the air unit to cool things off
it was degrees in the city and no hope of improvement
not bad if youre a lizard
but two hours earlier i was drinking acquavit with an eskimo lady in north east alaska
thats a tough change to make
it was so good i didnt want to leave so i left a day early
a little detached deckard taps another sensor on the panel lights up a cigarette and watches as his mes sages flash across the viewer stating date time and caller
the last one is repeated five times
deckard sighs switches off the viewer and gets on the radio
this is blade runner one calling com fast
the sound of a chime precedes the mechanical female voice that answers
blade runner one stand by please
followed by a husky male voice
where the hell you been
you know where i been
i been on vacation
next time you go on vacation do me a favor let us know where it is
holden got hit
there is a pause
that was bad news
youd better get in here
bryants waiting for you
ill see you in a minute
the engine revs the wipers rake two weeks of dust off the windshield and deckard jams out of the lot
an enormous grey vault of a building
a businesslike deckard strides down a long corridor with his brief case and police id pinned to his coat
i x p d referred to as a nexus the tyrell corporations new pride and joy
holden was administering the voight kampff test when one nailed him
the door in front of deckard slides open and he walks through
the nexus must be fast because holden was as quick as they come
the report said there were six of them
three males and three female
led by a combat model called roy batty
the inspector is in his fifties
the deep creases in his face the broken capillaries in his nose say brawler spoiler drinker but the diplomas on the wall say something else
bryants kneeled at his safe trying to open it
deckard it sitting on the edge of the desk reading the print out
they escaped from the colonies two weeks ago
killed twenty three people and jumped a shuttle
an aerial patrol found the ship in the desert
bryant gets the safe open and brings out a bottle of whiskey
bryants got a liver problem
a couple years back he handed me a bottle and said have a drink for another man
i been drinking for him ever since
deckard sets down the report and takes the shot bryant just poured for him
three nights ago one of them managed to break into the tyrell corporation
killed two guards and got as far as the genetic sector before he got fried going through an electro field
what was he after
there wasnt much left of him so we cant be sure
but bio chemical data and morphology records of the nexus were reported missing
going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send holden in to run voight kampff tests on the new employees
guess he found himself one
a grim pause
you got a machine on it yet
were using esper a that picked up holdens alarm
its guess is that all five are in the city
where do we start
bryants back at the safe locking up his bottle
the tyrell corporation has a demo model
check it out on the voight kampff
theres a chance the nexus is beyond out ability to detect
if thats the case everybodys up shit creek
what was the cover on the one that got holden
did personnel have an address on him
bryant fishes a piece of paper out of his pocket copies down a number and hands it over
ill go take a look
deckard stands and holds up his drink
like a sick boy looking out of the window bryant watches deckard down the whiskey
deckard puts down the glass and turns to leave
the big incentive to emigrate was still free labor
if the public found out that their door prizes might kill them they might not be so hot to go up there
this was one of the worst ones we had and bryant was worried
he wanted to tell me to be discrete or something
but i didnt give him a chance
an electrical storm is brewing
deckard stands out side the entrance to an old hotel holding an umbrella as people scuttle into doorways to avoid the sudden downpour
a heavy metal maze of cubicles and perilous iron balconies peopled with rejects from the surface world mato grosso indians in white mans clothes and other lower echelon welfare recipients
drop city is crowded cramped and darkly alive
deckard steps out of an elevator and moves through the crowd
a cloud of steam drifts up through a grating as two old men clad in towels descend a flight of stairs under a neon sign that says bath house
a musty subterranean wind ripples deckards clothes as he turns into an alcove
he stops in front of a door that says manager and pushes the buzzer
its opened by an emphysema victim with an oxygen tank lashed to his hip
deckard flashes his id and speaks some words which are inaudible due to the tuba music down the hall
the man grabs a key from his wall hands it over and shuts the door
the companion ways below deck of a big ship are no more bewildering than the ups and downs and ins and outs of this establishment
but deckard finds the door hes looking for
he pauses a moment listens then knocks
he inserts the key and with a hand on his gun opens it
an empty room
a cot and not much else
he steps in and stands quiet as a hunter sensing the signs
for a place surrounded by greasy hovels it is surprisingly clean
spartan in fact
the towel by the spotless basin is perfectly folded
deckard runs two fingers over a shelf
he looks in the waste basket
wadded up candy wrappers
the bed by the window is neatly made
deckard looks under it then runs his hands along both sides of the mattress
theres one suit in it
he pats it down
a show box on the floor
he stoops takes out what looks like a pen from his pocket and care fully traces it over the box
assured of its harm lessness he lifts off the lid
it contains a little stack of photos bound with a rubber band
deckard removes them goes to the lamp by the balcony window and turns it on
a touching collection of family snapshots
the kind of anonymous stuff sold by the bunch in dusty junk shops
the family dog
junior on the pony squinting in the sun
uncle ben clowning with the kids
the faded polaroid of christmas morning
simple pictures of simple folks celebrating the family bond
a curious collection for the likes of leon and deckard studies them with interest
oblivious to the cloudburst a blue eyed albino stands in the doorway peddling candy and artificial flowers looking like hed never been touched by the light of day
leon is standing behind him staring up at his room watching deckard at the window
hes still wearing his coveralls but he looks different
his face is more intent smarter and angry
for one seething moment it looks like leon might mash something but suddenly he swings away and disappears into the crowd
deckard pockets the pictures and moves away from the window
leons got a neck like a fire hydrant and legs to match but hes a graceful runner
looks like he could do it for days
and he could
hes put a lot of alley behind him and hes not out of breath
slowing down he cuts into an opening and comes out onto a narrow street
the asian quarter
a seamy as well as steamy little place
counter and small tables
old slant eyed enders humped over their fuming bowls jabbering and slurping
the only voice coming out clear is from the big three d tv on the back wall
as the mellow mouthed tv announcer delivers the message a latin looking beauty in a well fitted maids uniform does a twirl flashes a beguiling smile and glides out of
choose from a variety of seventy nine different personality types
each and every one a loyal trouble free companion given to you upon your arrival absolutely free
the latin beauty is replaced by an impeccable ray bolger type gentlemans gentleman who clicks his heels snaps to attention and struts off to make room for the next
to use as personal body servant to tireless field hand the custom tailored humanoid robot designed especially for your needs
the chinese are paying no attention but the man and the woman seated at the table by the window are
the woman is pretty a touch of gray in her hair kind and blue eyed
mary looks like an american dream mom right out of father knows best
the man also resembles a tradition the gym instructor short cropped hair with the body of a drill sergeant but the eyes are grey and chilling
roy batty is a presence of force with a lazy but acute sense of what goes on around him
leon has just come through the door behind them
try ing not to be the bull in a china shop he approaches their table and kneels
batty doesnt bother to look at him which amplifies the note of sarcasm in his quiet voice
did you get your precious things
somebody was already there
just a man
leon looks sullen
why dont you have a seat
theres one next to him
leon pulls it over and sits
enjoy the view
from the pot on the table mary pours tea and they sit so quiet and still in this noisy place that they seem almost invisible
the view theyre enjoying is through the window
outside the neon side in the win dow directly across the street says hannibal chew chew is a spindly old man of precision his veiled eyes are shrewd and chinese
but the rest of him looks like a charles dickens invention
hes got a jewelers glass stuck in his eye lurched over a lamp squinting at something in his hand
after a moment his lips peal back into a sour belligerent smile
well youre right
this little honey has a couple of defective cones
he snaps off the lamp and swings round to face his client
sebastians face is almost young but something has gone too far too fast
premature old age has made his bones brittle and his co ordination slow
the house may be dark but theres a light on in it
se bastian is a closet genius
youre a regular perfectionist sebastian
sebastians apologetic especially around the acerbic mr
its gotta be right for my customer
your customer eh
chew snickers and beckons
sebastian follows his down a high narrow hall to a heavy insulated door
theres a moth eaten full length fur coat hanging by it
chew tugs it on and they go through
the big door slams shut behind them
except for the work table with its sharp gleaming in struments the room is as barren and sterile as a morgue
the glass doored compartments in the walls look like crypts
some of them small as post office boxes
from one of the chew removes a vacuum packed box
carefully separating the seal he reaches into the purple jell and with a pair of tweezers extracts an eye
through the jewelers glass which he has not bothered to remove chew holds the eye up to the light and studies it a moment
his other hand searches through his pockets
you got a pocket charger boy
quick to accommodate sebastian removes a pencil like device from a row of such things in his breast pocket and steps closer
the back of the eye is touched with the pencil and the pupil moves
suddenly its staring back at them
is that good enough for your customer
anxious to leave sebastian nods
chew reseals the eye taking his time
he can afford to hes wearing his coat
how much is he paying you
in place of an answer sebastian clears his throat stares at the bag like he didnt hear
well when do you get paid
soon as i finish the job
when might that be
day after tomorrow
day after tomorrow
chew stares at the poor bastard con cerned in spite of himself
the rich hate to pay sebastian
a guy like tyrell keeps you waiting
pay the little guy last
you should charge twice as much
itll make him feel better
sebastian nods his head like thats exactly what hell do
chew sees its hopeless and hands him the bag
chew pulls the door open for him and sebastian goes through quick as a dog
sebastian may lack co ordination but he got what he came for and theres a hopeful spring to his walk as he heads for his truck
its an old panel job with ambulance siren and lights
the lettering on the side reads j
sebastian animoid express
sebastian gets in starts up the engine and suddenly realizes hes not alone
its a jolt that causes him to yelp
pris is sprawled on the seat next to him and wakes up with a yelp of her own
they stare at one another for a startled instant and she jumps out and starts walk ing
but shes forgotten her little beat up overnight case
sebastian puts the truck in gear drives next to her and opens the door
you forgot your
he holds up the bag
hesitantly she reaches for it
how come you were in my truck
i was tired and didnt have any place to go
she stares at him hand on her case looking lost
sebastian isnt good at this but he tries
you can get back in if you want
she cant make up her mind
dont worry i wont hurt you
she gets in
both of them are silent
people are not sebastians medium usually hes too shy but this girl is shyer still plus theyre about the same age it gives him courage
whats your name
so pleased with the way that went he forgets for a while what comes next
where do you want to go
that leaves him a lot of responsibility
he throws her side long glances but shes not helping
you want to go home
i dont have one
what do you do with a teenage beauty who looks like shes lost out of some welcome to sunny arizona poster
where are your folks
what about friends
i have some but i have to find out where they are staying
she leans forward and rests her elbows on the dash
her body would win prizes from any angle
well where should i take you
she looks at him a shadow of enticement in her clear blue eyes
we scared each other pretty good didnt we
we sure did
she giggles and laughs
im hungry j
ive got stuff
if you wanna go to my place
i was hoping youd say that
sebastians face is normally on the grey side but it just turned red
he turns on the ignition and they pull away from the curb
speeding along the freeway
the terminal in the com munications console lit
deckards right hand just finished a punch up
the screen flashes back
deckard punches up
letters flash across the screen screen flashes back deckard punches up
screen flashes deckards voice has been heard over the preceding
machines can be helpful sometimes but they can also be a pain in the ass
ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel mill
i dont mind a bum steer once in a while its their personalities that usually get me
somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image
if thats true whoever made esper should have been shot
this is esper and im ready
go ahead please
espers deep melodious voice is anxious to please and oiled with a touch of self pity
you equipped for random questions
why yes of course
the five in question are third generation nexus sixes constructed of skin flesh culture selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self perpetuating thought para physical abilities and developed for emigration
are you with me
how do i stop one
unlike a five they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another
sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run okay but
im coming to that
vulnerable zone is the base of the skull the occipital bone
a direct hit is a positive retirement
the communication is interrupted by a bell which is immediately followed by a stern mechanical voice
you are in violation of traffic ordinance m statutory freeway limit restricted by one hundred and eighty kilometers
in his rear view mirror deckard sees two black clad motorcycle cops coming up behind him like the hounds of hell
they draw silently alongside
deckard presses his i
to the window
the cop tosses a salute to deckard and he and his partner accelerate vanish in the night
and deckards car does too
a district of silence and ruin
the street is strewn with refuse
the building looks vacant
a ten storey condo gone to shit
the vandals have come and gone long ago
sebastians little white ambulance parked at the curb
deetchum the old watchman sitting in the building entry in a straight backed chair is reading a comic book
well stocked with items of survival all labeled and stacked
and shelved along the walls and hung from the ceiling is a menagerie of animoids
like so many broken toys awaiting resurrection from sebastians wise hands
sebastian is seated at a large work table bent over a stereo scope
the tool in his right hand is a sensor probe and hes using it with the delicacy of an en graver
the object of his concentration is a maze like chip configuration no bigger than a thumbnail but magnified under the scope it looks like an aerial view of a large
the needle like sensor probe moves care fully over the contours of the configuration testing the bonds
suddenly a blue flash erupts from one of the junctures
pris is light on her feet
shes standing behind him with a half eaten sandwich in her hand
you scared me
but hes happy to see her
shes changed her dress and made up her face
looks a little older and sexier
he watches her as she prowls around the room looking at this and that eating her sandwich
and you live in this building all by yourself
yeah i live here pretty much alone right now
trying to make light of it
no housing shortage around here
plenty of room for everybody
she sprawls on the couch studying him
how old are you
he cant meet her eyes
whats your problem
its not an easy subject
his voice is barely audible
they grow old too fast
is that why youre still here
i couldnt pass the test
there is a silence
he steals a glance at her
i like you just the way you are
under the desk he bats his knees together
ah you get hold of your friends
as a matter of fact i did
theyve got some work to do tonight but theyre gonna come tomorrow
the implications catch up
i can sleep on the couch
a little gray mouse on the shelf above his head bobs up
dont let the bed bugs bite
taking their cue from the mouse some of the more talented animoids toot flap and wheel about
its dark except for the glow of the terminal
a tired deckard sits in front of it
esper sounds like hes been talking for hours
nexus designated leon incept date april th to be used in military experiments to determine how hyper metabolism functions in deep space
nexus designated batty incept data april th combat model level of self sufficiency optimum
a long pause
heres something you might find interesting
they have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum
however after a period of time it is only logical that such a mechanism would create its own emotional responses hate love fear anger envy
i know all that
what about a summary then
i think were through for the night
deckard starts to reach for the panel
do you have something against science
not if it works
and what in your estimation works
deckard picks up the umbrella and with it stabs the terminal off button before esper can respond and the machine goes dead
he sits there for a moment then flips on the lamp
leons snap shots are spread out before him
a police marked spinner makes a sharp bank drops into a steep curve and slides towards the tyrell corporation
every government that could was racing to populate their colonial territory
but emigrants needed incentive
over population and the greenhouse factor didnt seem to be enough but owning a human look a like had lots of appeal
it was big industry the competition was stiff and tyrell was top of the line
the spinner gently touches down
the hatch drops open and deckard steps out
his claim to fame was making a product more human than human and sometimes the more turned out to be a problem
this wasnt just an escaped andy who broke his owners arm there were twenty eight people dead and the pressure was on
deckard walks up to a desk hands his i
to a guard who checks it against a list on a screen
but so far theyd always managed to keep it quiet
not to say that once in a while there wasnt bad publicity
some fanatic bitching about equal rights for andies or an occasional trade union proclaiming it was aun american for automatons to take jobs away from humans on the colony
the guard hands deckard back his i
pushed a button and deckard walks away
but whats more american than good old supply and demand
the government needed them industry made them and the church backed them
the big religious boys said that androids no matter how human were objects only god could make people
im not religious but i was inclined to agree
otherwise id be out of a job
the elevator door slides open
the young lady inside would look right standing on a cliff hair blowing in the wind looking out to sea in a th century painting
my name is rachael
deckard tips his head to her and steps in
no woman can be all things to all men the rachael comes closer than most
the only trouble is shes all busi ness
formidable without really trying
some beauty is better avoided and deckard looks straight ahead
the door slides open and they continue down the corri dor
it seems your department doesnt believe out new unit is to the public benefit
a humanoid robot is like any other machine it can be a benefit or a hazard
if its a benefit its not our problem
but because your department cant do an adequate job in detecting the miniscule number at large its a problem
they pass into a canopied air filtered corridor
deckard doesnt answer the question because hes looking at the animals
small northern animals in neat en vironmental cages
he looks at the rabbit the raccoon and the squirrel but the owl asleep on its perch stops him
the armed guard at the exit never takes his eyes off them
you like our owl
rachael claps her hands
the owl opens its yellow eyes and blinks at them
of course not
hands thrust in her pockets she strides off towards the exit without looking back
the exit is another tube
just big enough for two
no room for excess
he tries to ignore her cool appraising stare
youre in a very unique position mr
you could affect the future of this entire organization according to how you work your little test
deckard has nothing to say
are you apprehensive
why should i be
for the responsibility of your power
being a police bureaucrat youve got more than your share
the door slides open
deckard looks down at her
you got it wrong girl
i work with the bureau not for them
he lets it sink in
my job isnt to detect malfunctioning andies its to eliminate them
the more the better
he walks out of the elevator first
the office is dimly lit but highlights of resilience reside in the luster of the antique furnishings like glimmers of gold in a darkened mine
tyrell is a fragile man of power with that look of youth obtained from steroids and surgery
dapper and trim he leans against the desk looking at an old fashioned pocket watch
the only sound is the insidious perking of coffee brewing in the background
tyrell taps a sensor on his desk
the door in front of deckard and rachael slides open
they enter a vestibule and face another door this one befitting the decor of the office tyrell slips the watch into his pocket as they enter
how do you do mr
please sit down
would you care for a cup of coffee
tyrell pours from an old time sylex into small china cups and hands one to deckard
the congenial light in his eyes could almost pass for warmth dragon warmth
somehow i didnt expect that the man who did the dirty work would be the man to do the technical work
here you are mr
he hands deckard a cup of coffee
is this to be an empathy test
capillary dilation of the so called blush response
plus fluctuation of the pupil plus involuntary dilation of the iris
may i ask a personal question
have you ever retired a human by mistake
but in your profession that is a risk
nothing is infallible but so far the voight kampff scale bas been foolproof
like you said mr
deckard a machine can be a hazard
the voight kampff scale is a machine isnt it
one that relies on human interpretation
wheres the subject
sitting next to you
deckard stares at rachael then back at tyrell
delighted tyrell takes a cup of coffee
accepting the challenge deckard opens his briefcase and starts fishing out the apparatus
rachaels eye fills the screen the iris brilliant shot with light the pupil contracting
in the soft green glow of the dials the needles in both gauges are at rest
tyrell stands silhouetted behind deckard who sits in front of rachael a pencil beam trained on her eye
wire mesh discs are attached to her cheeks
youre given a calfskin wallet for your birthday
the needles in both gauges swing violently past green to red then subside
i wouldnt accept it
also id report the person who gave it to me to the police
you have a little boy
he shows you his butterfly collection plus the killing jar
again the gauges register but not so far
id take him to the doctor
youre watching t
and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist
id kill it
both needles go to red
deckard makes a note takes a sip of coffee and continues
in a magazine you come across a full page photo of a nude girl
is this testing whether im an android or a lesbian
you show the picture to your husband
he likes it and hangs it on the wall
the girl is lying on a bearskin rug
i wouldnt let him
i should be enough for him
deckard frowns then smiles
his smile looks a little like a grimace or the other way around
you become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend and you decide to get an abortion
id never get an abortion
that would be murder mr
in your opinion
it would be my child
sounds like you speaks from experience
he notes the needles
one goes green and the other remains inert
youre watching an old movie
it shows a banquet in progress the guests are enjoying raw oysters
both needles swing swiftly
the entree consists of boiled dog stuffed with rice
needles move less
the raw oysters are less acceptable to you than a dish of boiled dog
deckard moves the adhesive discs from her cheeks and switches off his beam
the lights come on
if she is the machine works
the machine works
rachael sits very still
except her eyes they go to tyrell and hang on
he stares back at her as he speaks
how many questions did it take
rachael sits rigidly in her chair as the ground crumbles around her her big mermaid eyes locked with tyrell
his voice is quiet and strong mesmerizing
shes hang ing by a thread
deckard watches with a bas taste in his mouth
she didnt know
she was programmed
but i think she has transcended her conditioning
i think she was beginning to suspect
rachael nods fixedly
careful not to let go her grasp
how many questions does it usually take mr
five maybe six
slowly carefully tyrell unlocks his gaze from rachael and turns towards deckard who is starting to put away his equipment
youre going to have to be on your toes my friend
deckard glances back at him
its a complex problem and we wouldnt want anything to happen to you
less of a man might shrink at the end of deckards look but not tyrell
for the good of all i recommend you take rachael with you
considering her uniqueness im sure she could prove quite helpful
deckard almost smiles at the nasty power of tyrells style
he turns away and starts packing up the voight kampff
deckard is ready to go
and how is it one man will be able to cover so much ground
all pertinent information is being fed into your departmental computer an esper i believe and a photo over lay packet is being produced
deckard opens the door
deckard i think it would be wise to reconsider my offer
rachael sits there very pale and expressionless her feet flat on the floor alone is the word
trying to keep the fury out of it deckards voice comes out in a whisper
i work alone
on the last word rachael glances up at him and deckard turns away
the outer door slides open and he goes through it
as seen through the windshield from the passenger side of a vintage dusenberg
the headlights cut through the dark illuminating a narrow strip of mountain road
a sign slides by stating caution curves ahead
good advice considering the sheer nightmare of a drop to the right and the wall of solid rock to the left
the steady hum of the engine and the hiss of the tires will remain but the location suddenly changes to a pleasant place of soft light and domestic charm
the young lady in the short dress is vacuuming the rug
her back to the viewer
as she bends over to vacuum beneath the couch exposing her beautiful ass an admonishment from a resonant and slightly tired male voice intercedes
lets keep our eyes on the road deckard
abruptly the view flashes back to the moon is up there slicing through the trees strobing over the hood of the car
the road is getting steeper and the corners sharper
rags of mist skim by as the dusenberg picks up speed
it is becoming a riveting ride but the passengers mind moves elsewhere
swift soft clouds overhead
in the cold shine of the icy light the viewer walks down an aisle of maples and beeches their clean hard limbs deflecting the frosty light and underfoot the crisp
blue white snow melted through in spots exposing soggy patches of rich brown earth
come on stay with the machine
the dusenberg is going faster now headlights eating up the road
rushing the corners in gut wrenching four wheel drifts
not a pleasant sensation if you dont like roller coasters
the dusenberg slides out of a corner and faces a couple hundred yards of straightway leading to the next bend
good place for a breather but the driver shifts into high and screws on
cold and gray
the current running strong
the nose of a kayak points through the swells the viewer paddling for the shore
this is cold remote country wild and untouched
a sky bluer than the madonnas cloak
the kayak banks and the viewer steps out moving over the sandy beach towards a little camp
were going to have to start the sequence again if you dont stay with me deckard
how do you know im not
youre not responding to the stimulus
i can see right here im not getting a reading
im tired of this
in the dusenberg the driver turns to look at the passen ger his specter like face obscured by shadow but by the glint of teeth he must have just smiled
and the passengers view snaps back to the road
suddenly another pair of headlights round the approach ing bend
large ones of a bus or a truck
the dusenberg is going too fast to stop
no room to pass
the dusenberg brakes goes into a broadside skid
the hands of the passenger reach out and grip the mahogany dash
brakes locked tires screaming skidding
the dusenberg tears through the railing and plunges into space
the last view of the passenger is pure vertigo
the good doctor is bending over his glass top desk which resembles a pin ball machine
displayed under its surface is a network of crisp electronic symbols and read outs indicating the results of the test
deckard detached the patches from his forehead which it a little damp but other than that he looks no worse for wear stands up to stretch and walks over to
the doctors desk
so how did i do
wheeler is a thin boney man aloof but a promise of compassion in his sunken eyes
nerves of steel
i didnt say that
your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time
meaning you dont run as fast as you used to
deckard starts to dress
during the road test
your mind kept wandering
that bothered me
considering the nature of your work that could be unhealthy
wheeler studies his desk for a moment and his finger comes down on the section illuminating deckards simple statistics
you got a birthday coming up
deckard bends over slipping on his shoes
wheeler looks up concerned
but you havent put in for emigration
youre going to be over the limit
listen i could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but i still rather be here than up there
what if you change your mind
theyll change the limit before i change my mind
never been more sure of anything in my life
deckard is ready to go
looking at wheeler a little touched with his concern
why didnt you go
but if you could
wheeler considers it a moment smiles and shakes his head
my job is here
they shake hands and deckard walks
the referee is bouncing around the ring trying to keep up with the two mexican light weights pounding the shit out of each other
if not for the fuzz and the silence the audio on the holoscope is off you might think you were ringside at the garden
its a good fight but pris isnt watching
shes got her feet up on the couch painting her toe nails
the room is so quiet you can almost hear the polish
she starts on her fourth toe when a noise form above stops her it sounded like a creaking of a floor but so quiet sudden and over so fast its
hard to be sure
she stares at the ceiling a moment then glances at sebastian
on the other side of the room in his own world sebastian is peering into his magnifier soldering gossamer strands with a laser
pris has crossed the floor and is closing the door quietly behind her
if the animoids nestled around the ledges of the room are capable of noticing theyd be the only ones in the room who did
pris moving smoothly past the doors some of them open and warped offering sights and shadow and decay
the gloom in here is like the light of the empty well
her feet against the metal steps reverberate in the hollow silence
shes running now down the hall stops at the apart ment directly above sebastians and opens the door
mary turns her head as pris comes in
shes sitting in a chair
the only piece of furniture in the room
its broken and tilts at a funny angle
she nods and pris nods back
batty is lying on his back rolling his head slightly from side to side like hes soothing a stiff neck
whats going on down there
hes not ready yet
tomorrow he says
batty nods he cant wait
pris glances at mary and gives a frigid little smile
pris backs out and closes the door behind her
batty blows air through his nostrils
like an animal
the sky is streaked with remnants of a lingering dusk
prisms of light flash over the sheen of deckards car as he cuts off the freeway and sweeps down the off ramp curve
moving through the dark city streets
deckard turns a corner and guns it up a long steep hill
at the top of the hill the car pulls into a drive and disappears into the subterranean garage of a high rise
hes coming down the hall carrying a foil wrapped plastic plate and stops in front of his door
its riddled with locks
he slips a small device out of his pocket aims it at the door and the locks unlock the bolts slide open
he walks in and kicks the door shut behind him
he slips on the light and crosses the front room
deckard is a pack rat hard to tell if he just moved in or is just moving out
as he enters the kitchen the sound of somebody behind him causes him to whirl around fast hand snapped out in front of him gun already in it
rachael almost got shot
but shes unruffled a little pale maybe but direct as ever
theres a long chilly moment then she almost smiles as her eyes move to the plate on the floor
was that your dinner
deckard looks down at the over turned plate and nods
i called and found out you were on your way home
these were already delivered to your department but i thought you should have copies as soon as possible
shes holding out a cassette the size of a cigarette pack
but its taking deckards adrenalin time to recede
its the nexus information you wanted
he takes the cassette but a man with so many locks must be wondering how they were gotten through so easily
he doesnt even want to ask
he realizes hes still got the gun aimed at her and sticks it back in his belt and theyre left staring at each other
the situation makes awkward silence
at least for him
shes looking at him like shes got something to say but isnt saying it
is there anything else
i know you think it complicates your work but im here to help
ive already got more help than i need
i think you need more help than youve got
he doesnt but shes not backing off
theres two reasons a man rejects help
either because hes so good at what he does he doesnt think he needs it or hes so insecure he cant admit it
sounds like im an ass hole either way but the answer is still no
two of us might be more effective than one
i work alone
no you dont
she lets it sink in
you use your equipment dont you
so im a piece of equipment
its a strong look that passes between them a long one
maybe if he were on firmer ground he might do something about such an offer but
deckards eyes follow her down as rachael bends to the floor and starts picking the food off the rug put ting it back on the plate
thats okay ill get it
he bends down to help but shes already done it
their heads a few inches apart
something in her eyes diminishes the distance even more
do i make you nervous
and she is
and suddenly he is too
she hands him the plate and they stand
shes looking at the floor almost shy then she looks up and hes watching her
she says it plain and simple
its strange to suddenly realize that what you thought was your life is actually someone elses fabrication
he feels it but doesnt know what to do about it
i can imagine
these are not some of deckards finer moments
but she doesnt seem to notice
a part of me is glad
i think i feel more
i dont like who i was before
deckard nods waits the respectable interval and is glad to have a plate to take into the kitchen
in the scrambled sanctuary of his kitchen deckard looks around for a place to put the plate but things have piled up on him in here
he contemplates the refrig erator
so why do you think they were after their records
hes a lot more comfortable talking shop
they probably want to find out when they were made
he dumps his dinner in the garbage and comes back out
shes writing something on a card
i guess the date of your birth is important if you know youre not made to last
no way he can keep his foot out of it
she looks up and hands him the card
thats my number
if you need me
she goes to the door opens it but hesitates before going through
you better get better locks if you want to keep me out
she looks back at him and smiles the smile says shes talking about all kinds of locks
deckard looks like he might ask her to stay but
and shes gone
he looks down at the number
its the back side of a snapshot
he turns it over
the picture of a man and a woman
the little girl between them looks like a six year old rachael
hes sitting in front of his console studying pictures of nexus sixes at they appear blank faced hairless and unadorned on his monitor
the over lay machine is transforming each image with instant attributes hair moustaches teeth eye colors age youth hats glasses etc
all in rapid succession running the gambit from ominous to beautiful
the possibilities were infinite
they could change their appearances but not their future
like she said it was short
longevity is what they were after
the garbage man even wanted a past
id check it out but i knew she was right
the market worked on turn over
built in obsolescence was the name of the game
that meant her too
it was something i didnt want to think about
on top of the monitor theres an open can of beans with a spoon stuck in it
deckard puts out his cigarette and reaches for them as the phone rings
regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants espers concluded that the only irregular category that tyrells got is the entertainment section
you better get on it
i was just about to have my dinner
if you hurry youll get back before it gets cold
i got a spinner on your roof in five minutes
deckard hangs up and looks at the beans
he didnt want them anyway
he gets up and walks to the bedroom
looks through the pile of clothes on the floor finds his ankle laser and straps it on
the spinner skirts through the canyons of the city
deckard sitting in the contoured seat watches the maze of suspension bridges platforms and catwalks swing by below
the tops of larger buildings shimmer with advertisements and weather announcements
deckard is cruising low and slow over the city listen ing to esper
nexus designated rachael is a prototype

what is a conventional term
which would make her termination date
do they have that knowledge

deckard taking it down
about to pull it in an already crowded lot but the sign flashes full
deckard doesnt believe in signs is about to set it down any way when a chicano in a fluorescent coat runs out and waves him off
pissed deckard veers away and buzzes low over and around the roof tops all dark and cramped not a lot of room around here
finally brings it down between two buildings hardly enough clearance but he jockeys the machine into an alley touches down and runs it slowly along the surface parking it by
a sign that says no parking
not many people
a nest of garish small time clubs
deckard emerges from one goes into the next
the pulsing neon over the entry says taffeys bar
crowded in here
deckard is at the bar sitting next to a big bellied man in a black beard whos looking through a viewer
on the small stage in the background amazing rama is eating razor blades a part of her juggling routine
deckard leaves the bar and walks down a hall towards a door at the rear
taffeys whats referred to in the trade as a chicken hawk collector of young girls
it must be so theres one in the bed
thin pale about thirteen years old eyes rolled up under her fluttering eyelids wires attached to her forehead lying flat on her back in taffeys crowded little room
taffeys a little fella with wide hips and narrow shoulders wears a jet black toupe and has a face like a seal
but at the moment hes not present
theres a knock at the door then the sound of a toilet flushing
taffey comes out of the bathroom heart pounding under his polyester bathrobe and approaches the door like the guilty fucker he is
he looks through the peeper
deckard is out there holding up his i
can i come in
there is a pause lasting the time it takes taffey not to think of a way to say no
the door opens and deckard enters
except for the drool coming out of the corner of her mouth and the fluttering eye lids venus doesnt move a muscle
excuse my niece there
shes studying for an exam
deckard takes the identikit hard copies our of his pocket and pushing some junk out of the way fans them out on the table
id like you to take a look at these pictures
taffey bends down really close peering at the pictures from about two inches away
you see i lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little
what am i supposed to be looking for
do you recognize any of them
he stops at zhora
this one looks familiar but i dont know
theres one came in today looks a little like this one but
what did she want
the girl that doesnt look like that girl
she wanted to know about suck night
i didnt know if i wanted to handle her i already got a snake act
but my partner goes down there to the opera house on suck night to book the good ones
whats suck night
thats what we call in the trade audition free for alls and most of it sucks
bit i dont think thats her
you talking about the opera house on the main
deckard goes to the door and turns
book the good ones for where
lots of places
the tours the clubs the silicone shows private parties
lots of these science guys never leave that place
we book two shows a month in there
those big time techs and bio guys might be real high zoners up here but when it comes to the arts they like it loud and lewd
its starting to get a little gooey
deckard tips his head good night and backs out of the door
onstage four mexican acrobats in matching metallic jumpsuits roll head over heels in their rendition of a human wheel
from the p
system the announcers voice blares through the cavernous theatre
lets hear it for the hermano brothers
hand in hand the hermano brothers bow deeply spring up and trot offstage
next were gonna see a little charmer who keeps her dancing partner in a basket
she comes to us all the way from exotic casablanca
the old boys in the pit strike up a tinny version of in a persian market as salome dances onstage
shes a black haired beauty in a scant belly dancer costume a couple of pounds overweight but all in the right places
she kneels ceremoniously center stage and sets the basket down before her
carefully removing the lid she reaches in and lifts out a four foot harlequin patterned python
grinding her hips to the music she rises holding the coiling snake out like an offering
sounds of approval from the audience
the gold coins covering her breasts jingle and shimmer as she weaves sensuously around the floor
to scattered applause hoots and whistles salome flounces offstage the snake hung around her shoul ders looking limp and makes her way through the narrow corridor to her dressing room
shes about to enter when excuse me miss salome
deckards posture and attitude suggest hum ble sleazy persistence
he comes closer with his shit eating grin
id like to have a word with you if i could
salome stands almost six feet high in her high heels she looks down on him with the haughty suspicion of a chick who knows how to handle cheap hits
im with the american federation of variety artists
he holds up a hand as if to stop her from protesting
dont worry im not here to make you join thats not my department
he glances around like a guy whos not supposed to be there
im an investigator for the confidential committee on moral abuses
she nods taking it a little more seriously
theres been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place
i dont know nothing about it
you havent felt yourself to be exploited by the management in any way
shes definitely puzzled
how do you mean exploited
like to get this position
did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person
are you for real
youd be surprised what goes on around here
id like to check the dressing room if i could
what the fuck for
this guy might be an asshole but hes funny
i dont believe this
she shrugs and they go in
musty and cramped
a portable shower a dressing table and not much else
salome takes the snake from around her shoulders and lays it on the dressing table
deck ard watches it undulate into the warmth of the lights
it that mother real
of course hes not real
you think id be working here if i could afford a real snake
its a good job
you mean the snake
theres not much costume to take off but shes doing it
does it eat
his hand reaches out to touch it
as his fingers make contact theres an electric snap
he jerks his hand back from the shock
do your job but dont wreck mine huh
she slides behind the screen and turns on the shower
deckard starts creeping around pacing around the room like hes inspecting the walls
they have their ways of doing their dirty work without the victim knowing whats going on
his eyes are moving over everything shes got
youd be surprised what a guyll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body
i bet i would
little dirty holes the bastards drill in the wall so they can watch a lady undress
and to his amazement he actually spots one
its down low on the wall
not a good idea to turn his back on work but he cant resist
and what if somebody did try to exploit me
who do i go to
through the hole deckard is looking at a pair of fat legs
and who do i go to about you
he looks back
shes some out of the shower dripping nude
shes taken off her black wig
her hair is short and blonde
deckard recognizes her immediately from the identikit
he stares at her a moment too long
deckard grins and she returns it
she takes a towel off the table and starts to dry her body
the snake noses through the cosmetics tongue flicking trying to get back to its mistress
absently she reaches out to stroke the snake and suddenly laughs
you ever get the feeling things arent the way they seem
her hand closes around the snakes head
deckard sees it coming but cant move fast enough
she strikes him so hard it knocks him off his feet
before he hits the floor she kicks him in the stomach
the snake whistles through the air again as deckard rolls out of the way
it slams down so hard it ruptures against the floor
he goes for his laser but shes already out the door
deckard bounds out of the room and sees her go through a door at the other end of the hall
he sprints after her arrives at the door and flings it open
the sound of her high heels clatter down the metal steps
its raining heavily
the front of the opera house is open only to foot traf fic these days
a bizarre place on a friday night hawkers and whores the rabble the poor and the cur ious mill around the randy built platforms and brightly lit stands
zhora in just a raincoat is not out of place in this flea market atmosphere
trying not to run she slices through the mob as quickly as she can
deckard is not far behind dodging and side stepping trying to move against the tide of people scurrying for shelter
she comes to an intersection and turns out of the mall onto a less crowded street
she glances over her shoulder as she breaks into a run and runs right into a couple of pedestrians
all three go down
deckard comes out of the crowd in time to spot her get ting to her feet
she sees him and runs
the two ped estrians are in his line of fire
he runs past them and drops to one knee leveling his laser
stop or youre dead
the beam flashes through the air but shes already around the corner
with his bottom lip between his teeth it hurts to move so fast deckard jack legs it into the street and jumps in front of the first car coming
it screeches to a stop
deckard scrambles for the door but the guy be hind the wheel has other ideas
he peels out fast
the next car slows down and swerves trying not to hit him
deckard goes for the door and before the old ma tron inside can lock it deckards yanked it open and jumps in
she screams as he pushes her into the pas senger seat and jams the car into a wrenching about face
the lady squeals like a pig as the momentum plasters her against the door
deckard slams it around the corner and guns it down the street
its long and its empty and its going by fast
nothing the old lady cares to see shes got her hands over her eyes whimpering hoping shell faint before she dies
deckard takes the next left so hard he almost lays it over
as the car bounces off the curb he floors it
zhoras a hundred yards ahead halfway down the street trying to make it back into the crowded mall
shes running fast but the car is faster
as he passes her deckard hits the brakes and skids broadside seventy feet
the door flies open and he rolls out firing
zhoras ducking it with no where to go except
the showcase window on her left explodes as she crashes through
its a corner shop joined to a series of stores front ing the mall
deckard runs to the opening shes made and pours fire through the tunnel of her jagged wake as zhora breaks through one window after another getting sliced getting shot trying
to get away from deckards laser
but she doesnt
his last shot burns a hole through the base of her skull
it kills her but doesnt stop her
her speed takes whats left of her through the last two windows and into the street where she runs into a parked car with such force that she embeds herself
in the side of it
hunched over breathing hard deckard comes slowly for ward
the crowd starting to gather
theres something for everybody and theyre coming from all directions
deckard moves through them edging to have a look
its not a good thing to see
it looks like salome and the car tries to eat each other
a bloody feast of metal and flesh
deckard bows his head sick exhausted
so much commo tion he doesnt notice three cops closing in from behind
deckard has his back to them
theyre fanned out and crouched ready to fire
deckard drops his laser
two of them rush up spin him around while the third does a frisk
two more cops arrive wary and wild eyed pushing the people back his is not a good place for cops
deckards ankle laser is discovered by the cop frisking him
with a snarl he pulls it out and hands it back to the sergeant covering the action
on your belly
deckards not in the mood for it
hes reaching for his id
the cop with the rubber billy hits him in the head
one thrill after another
somebody in the crowd yeowls
the last thing deckard hears as he falls
the cop reaches inside deckards coat for the concealed weapon they missed but its an id card
he looks at it for a moment then looks up
hey sarge this guys a cop
an embarrassing situation
clear this fuckin crowd
the cops start pushing
and for one split second one of the crowd looks a lot like leon
your standard low class crapper
bryant is planted firmly on the cracked tile floor next to the urinals rubbing his face trying not to pop the clutch in his anger
this is a public place he doesnt want to yell
just because its a nexus doesnt change procedure
a little known fact can become a well known fact and part of our job deckard is to make sure that doesnt happen
now how can be do that if you blow one away in front of a fuckin audience
its not the sort of question that expects an answer
deckards washing his face in the basin hoping itll all go away
deckard looks up dripping reaches for a paper towel
bryant slaps one in his hand
she was gonna get away
then let her get away
i thought you were a pro youre supposed to be a fuckin tracker
bryant takes a couple of deep breaths
id say you got a little carried away
deckards voice is barely audible
i didnt like her
you didnt like her
he slams the handle on one of the urinals
you start liking or disliking andies its time to hang it up
the plumping roars and sucks and dies
theres nothing to do but nod
poor bastard has had a rough night
bryant pulls a flask out of his coat and hands it to him
deckard puts it to his mouth and bryant watches deckards adams apple like hes count ing the swallows
deckard hands it back empty
bryant caps it puts it back in his pocket
look go home
get some rest
take an aspirin
bryant shuffles out like an old bear
cheap whiskey and bad wine
thats the kind of place this is
its near closing
but still a few at the bar
in the b
deckard comes down the passage from the mens room and stops at the phone
he gets a number out of his pocket and calls it
as he talks he leans against the wall his body language intimate and chummy
not much action at the bar other than somebody snoring and a dipso down at the end having a conversation with himself
deckard hangs up walks to the bar and straggles a stool
the bartenders a big lady with tits like sand bags and a voice that plays no favorites
i cant protect your drinks mister while you was in the potty this hummer snatched it
deckard glances at his stool mate
a huge man slumped over the bar like a beached whale
the whale doesnt move but it speaks with a gravelly russian accent
i thought was free drink
i will pay
but the big mans digging through his pockets
deck ards drink arrives and the russian raises his head
its a big melancholy face with a glint of warmth in his red rimmed eyes and a smile that could melt your heart
but its leon
i think i have no money
but i would like to buy you drink
ill but you one
whatll you have
shot of vodka please
thank you very much
deckard brings out his smokes
leon takes it and they light up
the drinks come
down the hatch
leon slaps his glass on the bar reach es into his pocket brings out a little match box and slaps that down too
its done with such pride that deckard has to look
you want to see my friends
sorry dont have the time
leon smiles broadly and with ceremonious care opens the box and dumps three live cockroaches on the bar
deckard looks interested
one of them starts to scamp er away but leon walls off the next with his huge hand
how long you had these guys
but this one is not guy
it is girl
leon leans closer like he doesnt want the cockroaches to hear
usually blackie waits until igor is eating then when his back is turned he tries to take advantage of anna
deckard nods definitely interested
he signals the bartender for another round
the drinks arrive
down the hatch
their eyes meet at the bottom
you never saw a cockroach make love
deckard shakes his head but hed like to
leon smiles slyly
we will try
leon brings a cube of sugar out of his pocket and puts it on the bar
they both lean down and watch intently
the drinks come and are put away but the cockroaches are not cooperating
it must be that he is not hungry or maybe she is not hot
leon is catching the roaches and one by one puts them back in their box
he holds up the last and kisses it
you like to kiss her goodbye
make sure you take your girlfriends with you when you leave
what neither of them notices is that between leons fingers his stub of his cigarette is burning his flesh
deckard lifts his glass it is empty
i like you
i like you too
one more eh
i gotta piss
deckard gets on his feet leans forward like a man in a stiff wind and stops
i think ill piss outside
leon watches his walk a perfect straight line through the bar down the passage and out of the rear exit
deckard reels out
the door swings shut and hes sober as hell and moving fast
around the big trash dumpster alongside the building he plasters himself against the wall and his gun is out aimed at the door
hes in a good spot with a perfect line of fire
moments go by and hes glad for the time to steady himself
the sound of his breathing the hum of the city and the quiet
suddenly from behind deckard is swept off his feet and twirled around in leons bear trap embrace
leon lets go and deckard hits the pavement skidding hard enough to tear clothes and burn skin but he rolls out of it and comes up with gun in hand
but leon is so fast hes already there and kicks it out of his hand
leon moves towards him backing deckard against the wall
how come you know where zhora was so quick
his hand is lightning
it shoots out grabs deckards hair
i showed pictures
somebody recognized her
i went to see
deckard is pale
the sweat is starting to run
how old am i
i dont know
the grip tightens and twists
my birthday is april
how long do i live
he lets go
more than you
deckards knees come up fast
leons fist comes down faster like a hammer
painful to live in fear isnt it
deckard is doubled over hugging his thigh
but thats how it is to be a slave
the future is sealed off he grovels he waits
even hurt deckard is fast
he goes for his ankle gun but leons got it out of his hand before he can even raise it and throws it down the alley
deckard hurls forward knocking him off balance and scrambles to get away
leon grabs him by the foot drags him back and jerks him off the ground
sex reproduction security the simple things
but no way to satisfy them
to be homesick with no place to go
potential with no way to use it
lots of little oversights in the nexus
he slams deckard into the wall
i tell you nothing is worse than having an itch you can never scratch
deckard slides down the wall to his knees and huddles protecting his head with his arms waiting for the next one
leon folds his big hands together and raises them over his head pausing just a second to savor the satisfac tion of smashing deckards skull
the spasm that runs through leons face is not from satisfaction
its the bullet that went through his neck
he hits the ground hard his big teeth biting the air like a rabid dog
rachael is standing in the alley
deckard lies there looking at her
she comes slowly and quietly forward and drops deckards gun by his side
deckard gets to his hands and knees and tries to get up but cant quite manage it
he looks up at her panting spits blood and almost smiles
like i said i dont need your help
after a long moment she bends down to touch him
you look terrible you know that
hes lying in the tub with a drink eyes half mast water up to his chin bruised and beat but looking just a little wicked in his balmy luxury
i knew a cop once who was involved in a high speed chase
they shot out one of his tires and he went over a cliff at hundred and fifty miles an hour
they found him in the morning with a broken skull six fractured ribs and second degree burns
on the way to the hospital he made a play for the nurse
he takes a drink and clears his throat
i thought you were supposed to be taking care of me
what do you need
he doesnt answer
lies there sipping his drink
rachael comes in a little uncertain a little droll and stands there looking down at him
dont just stand there looking at me
its not polite
what do you want me to do
she sits on the edge of the tub
gimme your arm
shes wearing a short sleeved dress
its a long del icate arm and deckard holds it inspecting it like a maestro with a stradivarius
he looks up at her
you ever take a bath with a man before
theres a lot i havent done with a man before
hes got her hand in the water and had begun to soap her arm
starting with her wrist and running the bar to her elbow up and down slow and slippery
she watches not quite sure of the ritual
he pulls her closer and runs his hand up higher mould ing and pressing working around her flesh up and under her arm into the privacy of her dress
youre getting me wet
for a moment deckard stares at her like some furry legged satyr in rut the fingers of his other hand rake through her hair and into the water she comes
the bed looks like it was hit by a storm and deckard looks like something that was washed up in it
hes spread out flat face creased and puffed
his eyes squint open but only for a moment
his hands are more reliable
they search over the bed but find it bare
he edges his head over the side looking around for signs but shes all gone
he gets up in two stages sits and then stands
then sits again resting his head in his hands
deckards got his face in the mirror shaving it
its been a long night
nothing a new tongue and a trans fusion wouldnt put right
he moves a couple of inches to the left so his eyes have a view of the tub
deckard is on the edge of the couch with the phone on his knees the card with rachaels number in his lap and having no luck
sorry i am not in at the moment but if youll leave your name and number ill return your call as soon as i can
thats not soon enough
deckard hangs up puts the phone on the floor and leans back on the couch
fuck you then
the rooster perched on the chair spreading its scrawny wings strains from the tips of its toes crowing at the ceiling
between crows theres a tapping at the door
you might call this a barnyard apartment
theres straw on the floor and several hens roosting against the back wall
the front door opens a few inches and sebastian pokes his head in
nobody seems to be home except his chickens
as sebas tian enters closing the door behind him a goose charges out of the bedroom hissing and honking
now now waddles
seeming to recognize sebastian as no intruder waddles veers off from the attack
as sebastian crosses the room a pig peeks out from behind the couch
he goes to the chickens and collects some eggs putting them into a bowl hes brought
he puts down the bowl and reaching into his pocket carefully counts out the payment and puts the money on a plate
hes about to leave but notices theres no water in the dispenser
deetchum isnt taking very good care of you people
pouring from a jug on the table he fills the dispenser with water scatters a little grain on the floor gets his bowel of eggs and leaves
wrigley grunts and comes out from behind the couch for a long drink
sebastian arrives on his floor walks down the hall to his apartment opens the door walks in
he turns to close door comes face to face with roy batty
sebastian drops his bowl of eggs
battys hand flashes out and catches it
smiling batty hands them back to sebastian who is too startled to speak
pris runs up and gives batty and mary a big hug steps back effusing and smiling everybodys favorite teen ager
this is my uncle roy sebastian
hello glad to meet you
he pumps sebastians free hand
and my aunt mary
sebastian turns and theres aunt mary modest and warm
and this is my savior j
sebastian stands there with his eggs bashful and ex cited the hero of this little familys warm attention
cant thank you enough mr
if you hadnt come along
we were worried to death
its awfully kind of you
sebastian is nodding and smiling
were not used to the big city
where we come from its not so easy to get lost
you certainly have a nice place here
batty looks around admiringly
sebastian mumbles some thing that sounds like thank you
sebastian doesnt like to go out too much
i keep a lot of provisions right here
i like a man who stays put
an admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times
you live here all by yourself do you
well no not really
deetchum hes the watchman he lives on the first floor
a long pause
we havent found it easy mr
they glance around the room waiting for sebastian to pick up the ball
how about breakfast i was just going to make some
if it wouldnt be too much of a bother
a little bite to eat would be
oh no bother id be glad to
well actually were famished
sebastian is truly happy
you make yourselves comfortable and ill bring the food right out
he disappears into the kitchen
batty looks happy with the way things are going
pris comes up close
her tone muted but demanding
batty finds her attitude amusing which makes her even more pugnacious
i want to know whats going on
theres a punitive edge to battys response
theres only three of us left
pris is shocked
her whisper comes out a hiss
then were stupid and well die
not if everybody is doing their job here at home
how are things at home
a little spotted pig on the table sits up
home again jiggidy jig
they all turn and stare at the pig
batty is delighted
i dont trust him
i dont think he knows what hes doing
the bell tone from the microwave goes off in the kitchen
he knows what hes doing
if he wont cooperate
sebastian is a host who wants to be appreciated
well appreciate him and hell cooperate
holden is laid out in an apparatus that resembles an iron lung
a little above his head facing him is a bank of bio feedback lights registering body functions
deckard is in a chair sitting next to his friend
holden has lost weight his face is grey he cant move his head but hes smiling like the cat who ate the canary
how are you doing old man
holdens voice is just a whisper the kind of whisper that comes out of the joker at the back of the class
i mean i know im not really great but i feel just great
how you like my new suit
well you dont have to worry about getting it wrinkled
holdens eyes close his smile gets bigger and little spasms of laughter pump out of his mouth
dont make me laugh
it makes me pee
hey its okay
i like to pee
so how are you doing
im doing okay
from what i hear youre doing great
bryant tells me youre going like a god damn one man army
making a lot of money huh
pause but thats what i wanted to talk to you about
i got a problem
lets hear it
i think im starting to empathize with these nexus sixes
starts to laugh again
a blue light on the panel begins to turn very bright
they both notice it
im taking a piss
they wait for the light to abate
let me ask you something deck
you been having intimate relations with one of these units
deckard doesnt deny it
holden smiles like a cherub
thats what i thought
one of the liabilities of the trade you has sex with your prey old buddy
thats bound to create problems unless youre a black widow
deckard has to wait for him to stop giggling
what about not sex but love
holden bites his bottom lip to keep the laugher out of his voice but he cant
love is just another name for sex
love is sexy and sex is lovely i dont care what you call it an android cant have it
these arent just
i know what they are deck look maybe they can pretend to feel but far as the raw hot emotions of the old heart no way
holden stops talking for a moment to get some air
believe me take it from an old pro no matter how good we get were never gonna make an artificial anything that can feel
its a contradiction
you might as well go fuck your washing machine
holden laughs deckard doesnt
just go out there and keep up the good work
holdens whispers have become harder to hear
got to save it deck im getting sleepy
its been good talking to you
but hes already asleep
deckard stands there a moment looking at him then walks out
hes sitting on the couch glum contemplative
theres a sound
his eyes move to the door
those locks are opening again
rachael comes in
looks surprised to see him
i told you id come back
you didnt hear me
you were sleeping
he likes that
are you glad im here
hasnt seen this place in the daytime
pleased he watched her move around the mess
she spots a little framed photograph
picks it up
its a man with a shotgun and a boy holding up a quail
who is this
me and my dad
where is he
she puts it down and comes to him
how come youre not on the job
part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out
how are you doing
not too good
she sits next to him
pleased as hell they both sit there staring straight ahead
he looks at her
she looks at him
what do people do in the afternoon
if they are smart they take naps
theyre under the sheet
rachael is on her back look ing at the ceiling hair sprawled like sea grass over the pillow
deckard lies next to her a man studying a treasure
do you dream
i wish i could
his hand moves over her shoulder
wishing is a kind of dreaming
his hand goes under the sheet
i mean asleep
she feels good
he moves closer
did you cry when your father died
thats another thing i cant do
he kisses her lightly on the cheek
nobody is freer than when he dreams
i read that
it wasnt very good last night was it
i dont know i have nothing to compare it to
i guess i thought there was something more to it
i dont know
i think i missed something
im not sure
is there a secret
her face is close
shes looking right at him
her lips are right there
i dont know
if there is id like to find it
slowly their lips touch and his arms slide under her body
batty pris and mary sit at the table staring at their host
sebastian is staring back his fork halfway to his mouth looking from face to face
although nothing is being said hes totally comfortable as much at home with them as he is with his animoids
why are you staring at us
youre just all so
batty nods his head smiling sending home the fact and sebastian is certainly getting it
a long pause
what makes you think so
youre all so perfect
sebastian is smiling from ear to ear
what generation are you
marys head is shaking slightly
pris gets up and moves to the couch
batty couldnt be more pleased
we can trust sebastian ladies
hes been working with mechanisms all his life
hes a wizard and a very perceptive man
sebastian looks like a kid on christmas eve
his voice is trembling
show me something
like a million things but hes too excited to think of one
were not computers sebastian were physical
pris perks up proudly
i think therefore i am
very good pris
now show him why
its a command pris is pleased to obey
she sits quiet ly a moment hands folded in her lap prim and proper
mary doesnt like these displays but batty is beaming
those hands in pris lap suddenly move almost faster than the eye can see and slam down on either side of her digging into the material with such ferocity that
she plunges into the guts of the couch up to her elbows and comes up holding springs and stuff ing
except for the clenched teeth she is smiling like an angel
sebastian is riveted his eyes wide and astounded like hes just seen the devil
he laughs nervously glad that the devil is a friend
we have a lot in common
you mean that you cant come here and i cant go there
not only that but we have smiliar problems
but we dont want to die quite yet
of course not
you could help us
i dont know much about biomechanics roy
i wish i did but youre out of my league
if we dont find help soon pris hasnt got long to live
sebastian sneaks a glance
pris is staring at him with big childlike eyes sebastian looks back at batty moved but helpless
what about your friend the man who owns this building
hes not really my friend
i just do a job for him now and then
tyrell could help us sebastian
his company made us
id be happy to mention it to him
be better if i could talk to him in person
but hes not an easy man to get to
when do you deliver your project
batty leans forward and looks right into sebastians eyes
will you help us
theres no way sebastian could say no even if he wanted to
pris sits up smiling
mary sighs a breath of relief and batty leans back nodding in gratitude
im sure glad you found us sebastian
what do you think mary
i dont think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us
pris gets up and comes to sebastian and kisses him
that has a lot of impact
sebastian looks around try ing to keep the tears from coming
youre our best and only friend
rachael is lying across the bed in one of deckards shirts her chin over the edge her eyes moving around the room
deckard lies next to her
looking like a man who died a voluptuous death
when was the last time you cleaned this place
have you ever cleaned your apartment
dont be fooled by appearances
it appears to be dirty why dont you get somebody
he rolls over to admire her legs
because they would ruin the arrangement
he kisses the back of her thigh
they could clean around the arrangement
i dont like people snooping around my stuff
he kisses her other thigh gets up and goes into the bathroom
theres a vacuum in the front room closet is you wanna give it a try
rachael lies there a moment then gets up and goes into the front room and opens the closet door
the vacuum is not easy to get to but finally she wrestles it out
as she starts to plug it in oh no dont do that
hes wrapped in a sheet watching her from the doorway
but if i dont plug it in how can never mind the plug just go through the motions
but then how can you
i dont like the noise
practice makes perfect
she stares at him like hes nuts
show me how you would do it
reluctantly she makes some half hearted passes with the thing
how about under the couch there
she bends over to get it
deckard pulls up a chair and sits down with his chin in his hands
she looks back at him
this feels stupid
good for a smart girl to feel stupid
part of your education
she drops the vacuum and sits on the floor
deckard gets up and comes towards her
her eyes travel halfway down his sheet and she leaves
youre sick deckard
i never felt better
mansion and opulent grounds
sebastians humble truck parked among richer relations including a spinner and a dusenberg
it contains a collection of big game trophies and among all this sits sebastian very straight and proper with an egg the size of a basketball in his lap
old hannibal chew was right the rich make you wait
sebastian stands and carefully makes his way between the trophies to a window with a view of the grounds
tyrells young wife sits on the diving board watching her husband in the pool with their youngest tot
and two older lads swim around trying to outdo each other for their dads attention
from the sidelines an old servant pauses to watch the fun then continues with a tray of mugs towards the house
and beyond on a plateau overlooking the grounds a figure stands watching waiting like a bird of prey
on a gravel path between shrubs of winter roses tyrell turns to observe the last quiet light over his kingdom
the moment is sweetened by the low plaintive bellow of one of the animals
he strolls by an old gardener who tips his cap pro ceeds up the steps and into his mansion
next to a tray of cookies and milk sebastian sits pa tiently with the egg in his lap
as the door opens he gets to his feet expectantly
its styles tyrells bodyguard
he could play the giant in jack and the beanstalk
okay ill take that now
sebastian would rather put it in the bosss hands but styles takes it and is almost through the door when sebastian stops him
he almost forgot
cant fly without the pilot
sebastian hands him a little box
styles stuffs it in his pocket and shuts the door behind him
motionless and monumental six buffalo stand like stat ues in the grass
suddenly they swing their shaggy heads to watch something pass
in the dark silence batty stops to look at the curious beasts and then moves soundlessly towards the mansion
its a medieval sized hall
the piece de resistance is an th century english painting of an arab stallion gleaming like coal over the crackling fireplace
the entire family is seated at the table which glitters for the festive occasion
presents gathered around the oldest child
styles hands the egg to tyrell
a hush falls over the table
this is dads big present
tyrell sets is down before the boy
ian is a fresh slim lad who is ten today
he looks up at his father then beaming pries open the eggs hinged lid
tyrells hand goes to his pocket and the griffon steps out of the shell
basically an avian invention it has wings and plumage the head of an eagle the body of a lion and weighs no more than eight pounds
it cranes its neck and testing its balance stands on one leg and then hops to the edge of the table and into the air
the littlest tot claps her hands as the griffon beats its wings rapidly and rises towards the ceiling
turn ing in a forty five degree it suddenly drops into a dive
delighted the children shriek and scream as the griffon swoops over their crouching heads and sails the length of the hall its silhouette flickering briefly over the ancestral portraits of
the tyrell clan
reaching the end of the room it banks sharply and flies back towards the table cups its wings spreads its tail and comes in for an awkward landing
theyre laughing and clapping as it waddles down the table and knocks over a glass and stops in front of ian
did you make this
we can make man but not a griffon
he bends down and kisses his wife
have to give the cottage industry a chance too
pleased he excuses himself and heads for the den
tyrell comes in and sits behind his desk
sebastian hands down the invoices
tyrell glances over them and writes out a check
he looks up to hand it over when he sees batty against the wall by the door
for a fraction of a second hes shocked but recovers fast
a friend of yours sebastian
yes this is someone who wants to talk to you dr
the name is batty
very slowly tyrells hand moves towards the back side of the desk
to act without understanding could lead to the very thing the act seeks to avoid
whats in battys eyes completes the warning
tyrell decides to heed it
a little talk it all i need
tyrell looks at sebastian
back to batty
would you like to talk in private then
batty thinks it over
it might be better if we talk in private sebastian
why dont you go home
heres your check my boy
thank you dr
ill see you later
he slips out closing the door behind him
opens it again and sticks his head it
was everything okay
if tyrell is scared hes doing a good job of concealing it
im surprised you didnt come to me sooner
its not an easy thing to meet your maker
and what can he do for you
can the maker repair what he makes
would you like to be modified
had in mind something a little more radical
whats the problem
im afraid thats a little out of my
batty cuts in with a whisper
i want more life fucker
batty walks forward
the facts of life
ill be blunt
to make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system at least by men makers or not it fatal
a coding sequence cant be revised once its established
because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies like rats leaving a sinking ship
the ship sinks
what about e
weve already tried it ethyl methane sulfonate is an alkylating agent and a potent mutagen it creates a virus so lethal the subject was destroyed before we left the table
batty nods grimly
then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells
wouldnt obstruct replication but it does give rise to an error in replication so that the newly formed dna strand carries a mutation and youre got a virus again
but all this is academic you are made as good as we could make you
but not to last
put it this way
rolls royces are made to last as least they were
but im afraid youre a ferrari
a high strung racing car built to win not to last
batty smiles bitterly
also youre too valuable to experiment with
tyrell cant help a flash of pride
the bast of all possible androids
were proud of our prodigal son glad youre returned
youre quite a prize
shoulders hunched batty looks down an uncharacteristic note of guilt in his voice
ive done some questionable things
also extraordinary things
nothing the god of biomechanics wouldnt let you in heaven for
they share a laugh
in spite of himself theres a look of relief in tyrells face as batty extends his hand
tyrell takes it and they shake
the reverence in bat tys eyes caused tyrell a fatherly smile
the smile turns into a growl as he feels the bones in his hands crack
before the scream comes out of his mouth batty stifles it
tyrell claws at the iron fingers but theyre sinking into his face
placing his other hand behind tyrells head batty squeezes them together and squashes the mans head like a melon
the mess is not small
palms up like a surgeon batty walks to the drapes and wipes off the gore and without looking back strolls out of the room
styles is coming down the hall
he sees batty coming towards him
styles looks at him curiously this is not one of the guests
as they close batty smiles
could you tell me where the bathroom is
styles doesnt get a chance to answer
battys hand has torn into his crotch
the man is lifted off the floor up the wall and held a moment
whatever is encased in his pelvis is pulverized
batty lets go
styles hits the floor
he died of shock
grinding his teeth batty continues towards the sounds of the festivities
the birthday cake has arrived the candles lit
theyre waiting for dad
tyrell looks around to find batty observing from the doorway
a little startled a little curious but ever the cor porate wife she smiles
may i help you
batty smiles back and shakes his head in mock regrets
in the sink the faucet is on
the water pink with blood
batty is washing his hands
a portly maid emerges from the pantry
batty looks up
she stops embarrassed at being caught
her eyes no tice drops of blood on the floor and follow them to the door
when she looks back batty is right in front of her
books scattered on the bed
rachael sitting cross legged with one in her lap looking through exquisite shots of nature
deckard is next to her watching her like a lover like a father
shed never seen the great outdoors
never even seen books on the subject
she went through everything i had and we talked
and there were subjects we didnt discuss and they were words we didnt say i couldnt say like death like future like real
but it was hard because she was curious and full of questions
she was more alive than anyone id ever known
she looks up stunned by the beauty of a photo but with no need to comment
its in her eyes
she stares at him a revelation taking shape
you and i are good friends huh
he considers it and she stares at him smiling at the wonder of it
its so easy
convinced and not convinced he nods his head
she laughs at his solemnity
deckards pretty irresistible himself
have you ever known anybody a long time
you mean a woman
whats a long time
nobody could stand me that long
the chime on the phone next to the bed goes off
he reaches out and brings it to his ear
this is bryant
are you alone
shes not with you
take a number
canapt tenth floor villa vita district olympia south
okay here it is
eldon tyrell his family and half his staff were just massacred
the cat is about to get out of the bag
pressure is definitely on
the nexus program is terminated
when you finish there locate nexus designated rachael and retire
deckard says nothing
if you dont we will
it has to be total deckard
thats an order from as high as it comes
i got it
he hangs up the receiver and gets up
she watches him from the bed
the gun goes into his belt
he loads the ankle job and straps it on
she watches every move
why do you call it retire why dont you call it murder
because its not
dont you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered
andies only simulate suffering if theyre programmed for it
do you think i simulated what happened between us
no i dont
without looking at her he puts on his jacket
hes standing in the middle of the floor with his back to her
he turns and theyre facing one another
neither of them moves
dont leave here
dont open the door dont answer the phone
what difference will it make
just wait here
he goes to the door
you know what i think
that some of the folks around here are more programmed then me
he has to laugh
you know what else i think
this was the best day of my life
he turns and goes through the door
sebastian is putting his work table in order but his mind is not with it and his hands are trembling
batty pris and mary are on the other side of the room talking their voices low
lets go while there is still time
whats the point
not to be trapped
you underestimate the trap mary
sebastian has almost reached the door
where are you going sebastian
just thought id
no you stay here with us
out last night together
they all watch
sebastian walks away from the door
think of yourself as a light mary
shine before youre turned off
shes too fragile for that logic but it appeals to pris
she and batty hold a look that burns
sebastian is by the window
someone is coming here
batty goes to the window and looks down
he smiles he must be good
then go get him
that wouldnt be very sporting
sebastian looks ready to bolt
batty puts an arm around him
i want to do it
okay but dont kill him
save a little for everybody
turn out the lights pris
in the dim nocturnal light deckard crosses into the courtyard fronting the building and stops
he looks around
nobody there just silence
he comes closer to the building and stands in the sha dows off to one side of the entry
his head jerks up to the sound of crashing glass
sebastian comes hurtling down and explodes into the pavement thirty feet below
deckards eyes move up the line of descent the shat tered window on the next to top floor
not much to see but deckard misses none of it as he crosses the floor and positions himself in the spot of least exposure
he looks around
elevator and stair well
close to the wall he moves towards the elevator keep ing an eye on the stairwell door
stepping to one side he hits the button
the elevator door slides open
he reaches in presses a button and as the doors slide shut deckard slips a pen between the doors jamming the operation
deckards shoes and soundless as he quickly crosses the lobby floor
he pauses a moment in front of the stair well door then pushes it open and steps into the dark on the other side
suddenly he spins dropping to the floor and fires three times in to the figure hovering to his left
the man is hanging off the floor his arms locked into the railing neck broken with three holes in his chest
but he was already dead
deckard stares at the corpse
deetchum the old watchman
that rustling sound are rats who were feeding on him scampering for safer places deckard gets to his feet
the stairway rectangles ten stories up
as his foot touches the first step a raw terrified scream shatters the air
it came from below
its the cry of a young girl it grows to a piercing shriek and abruptly stops
deckard ejects the half used cartridge from his laser inserts a fresh one and quiet as the silence descends the basement stairs
at the bottom he faces a corridor
the faint hum of machinery comes from the double doors at the far end
the hum becomes a rattle by the time he gets there
each door is fitted with a small window
deckard steps to the side and peers through
its a gym
the mirror lined walls are cracked and tarnished the equipment atrophied from lack of use
the heavier barbells have sunk into the floor
two weight reducing machines are flapping and grinding away like idiots
deckards eyes stop on the woman
she dangles a few feet off the floor hung by the shoulders through rings suspended from the ceiling
her head is slung forward her body limp and slightly swaying
deckard pushes open one of the doors until it touches the wall
slowly he advances toward the hanging figure keeping an eye on the mirror to cover surprises from the door
hes not breathing hard
his heart isnt pound ing
deckards in his element
close enough to look up into her face he stops
it isnt grisly death that causes the reaction in his eyes
its the innocence of her angel face
its not something he has time to consider
in the mirror behind him he sees the door starting to open
he shouldnt have
pris legs snap up crack the laser out of his hand and clamp around his neck
slowly the door swings closed but deckard doesnt notice
his carotid artery is no longer sending blood to the brain
he jerks up his foot and reaches down
as his fingers close around the ankle laser pris fingers close around his wrist
deckards hand opens like a flower
the laser drops to the floor as his eyes roll back into his head
she lets go but before he can fall she rams a foot into his back
hes propelled fifteen feet across the room slams into a machine and falls to the floor
pris flies off the rings and comes at him
deckard reaches out to pull himself up but shes al ready there
not too hard and just in the right place she kicks him in the stomach
he goes back to the floor gagging for air
oh so precisely she reaches out with a long index finger and flips the switch on the machine
its a flab eliminator with a vibrator belt
normally an innocuous piece of equipment but the motor housing on this one is missing
lots of grinding metal
a bad place for flesh and bone
but thats where deckards hand is going
an eight year old against a full down man
in two more seconds his hand will be ground round
deckard tries to pull his hand loose
it wont come
he yanks hard but its welded in hers
his face is twisted and strained as he raises a leg wedges his foot against her chest and pushes with all his might
the hold breaks
they topple back
deckard hits the floor gulping to catch his breath
pris is up and coming for him again
she hovers over him
deckard rolls out of the way as she comes down like a pile driver
reflexively deckard raises his arm to protect himself
pris just smiles takes hold of his foot and drags him across the floor
she doesnt like to leave a piece of work unfinished
theyre going back to the machine
he goes by a weight stand of dumbbells and grabs hold
it doesnt stop him
hes sliding over the floor like it was ice weight stand in tow
pris gets to the machine yanks his foot up and forces it toward the opening
deckard sits up a five pound dumbbell in his hand and clobbers her in the back
it knocks her off balance but she doesnt let go of his foot
she hooks out with a fist but misses
he gets her with a roundhouse in the face
she goes to the floor and deckards up the dumbbell over his head coming down with it
fighting for her life now pris drives a foot into his chest
it lifts him off the floor
he flies back across the gym and lands in a heap
no more games
pris is furious and moving fast
she rips a steel bar out of the wall and holding it over head charges him like a samurai
as she comes down for the kill she freezes
deckard landed near the laser
he crawls towards it
as in a nightmare it takes forever
but he gets there
he reaches out and grabs the laser rolls over and takes careful aim
she charges towards him screaming her rage
he fires as she comes
the shot amputates her left arm at the shoulder but her hand doesnt let go of the bar
it dangles crazily in front of her as she charges forward
he puts the next one through her neck
pris hiccups a rope of blood as she flies through the air and crashes next to deckard
he lies next to her chest heaving
slowly he rolls over and gets to his hands and knees
panting he stag gers to his feet and stands over her swaying slightly
the sound that escapes his throat is raspy and dry
it might not sound like a war cry but it is
laser in hand deckard kicks open the swinging doors and walks into the corridor a dangerous man
deckard arrives at the main floor landing checks his loads and continues up the stairs
hes going to shoot the next thing that moves and find out later if he was right or wrong
on the next landing he throws the door open
his eyes move down the hall looking for prints in the dust
he continues up the stairs
on the ninth floor he finds what hes looking for
footprints coming and going from a door halfway down the hall
he stops to the side of it and listens
deckard fires three quick shots through the door
if somebody were on the other side of it they arent now
he kicks the door open and dives through head first and hits the floor in a roll pouring fire into the far corners of the room but the room is
theres a kitchen bar a closet and a bedroom door both closed
deckards breathing is the only sound
no response from either door
maybe it was a sound maybe intuition but suddenly deckard twists around and fires several shots into the closet
the smouldering door slowly creaks open
mary is huddled in the rear of the closet
her hand out like somebody about to catch a ball but afraid of it
in her other hand she clutches a button eyed monkey
her face is bewildered frozen in fear her body riddled with holes
no recognition gap here
deckard shoots her through the neck to make sure
mary falls to the floor like a puppet with her strings cut
deckard backs away from the pathetic figure in the closet and sits on the sofa unable to take his eyes off her
deckard lays the laser down next to him holds out his hand and looks at it
he drops it in his lap closes his eyes and leans back
a tapping from the ceiling
deckard looks up
a knock with the proverbial double rap at the end
deckard jumps out of the way as the ceiling gives in
chucks on concrete and plaster hit the couch where he was sitting
the hole is a couple feet in diameter beams cracked through exposing the apartment above
deckard wipes the plaster dust from his eyes and mouth then whispers hello roy
deckard comes out onto the landing
taking his time he climbs the steps to the next floor the last floor
he shoots the hinges out of the big stairwell door pushes it with his foot and it comes down with a bang
the reverberations turn into silence
the corridor is empty
moving fast but cautious he passes each door until he gest to the apartment above sebastians
slowly he turns the know and pushed open the door
except for the hole in the middle of the floor theres nothing to see
back against the wall he moves to wards the bedroom but stops at the noise
it sounds like the hooting of an owl and its coming from the hallway
deckard looks around the corner of the door down the hall
battys at the other end
except for jockstrap and gym shoes hes nude
you wanna play
he ducks into a doorway
pops out again
not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent
i thought you were supposed to be good
arent you the man
the makeup on battys face is somewhere between a coman che warrior and a transvestite
the immensity of his insolence awesome the muscles of his body are swol len trembling from the thrill of it
this is how we do it up there lad
in a blue of lightning like action batty whips down the hall zigzagging off the walls towards deckard so fast that deckard gets only three shots off before the blur
crashes through the wall on his left with a laugh
deckard stands there a moment digesting the impact of it then edges up to the gaping wall
batty is be hind him
he knees deckard in the back and slaps him in the head
deckard goes to his knees then over on his face
batty kneels next to him
not hurt are you
you better get it up or im going to have to kill you
unless youre alive you cant play
and if you dont play you dont get to be alive
deckards eyes are closed mouth bleeding
he exhales and makes and effort
he slides his hands up even with his chest and starts to push
thats the spirit
like a matador batty walks away
by the time deckards on his feet battys disappeared through one of the doors
deckard wipes the blood from his mouth bends down and picks up his laser reloads and looks down the hall towards the jeering voice
come on deckard show me what you got
im right here on the other side of the door
but you gotta shoot straight cause im fast
deckard gets to the door blasts it kicks it open and fires at batty
but its only the reflection of batty
the full length mirror on the other side of the room shatters
battys next to him grabs deckards hand and steps in closer
straight doesnt seem to be good enough
theyre face to face
you dont have a chance do you
in an exaggeration of weary disappointment batty drops his head to the side
looks like im gonna have to scale it down for you
give you a handicap
i wont run through any more walls
i promise to use the doors
deckard stares back at him but doesnt respond
sud denly fury storms through batty
he throws deckard out the door knocking him down grabs him by the collar and rams his head into the wall
come on lets use that brain
he drags him down the hall on his knees and bangs his head into the wall again
we need a little resilience around here
he yanks him further and bashes his head again
where are those balls of yours
lets see a little bravery
the storm passes
deckard hangs in battys hand like a bag of laundry
that was irrational of me not to mention unsportsmanlike
wont happen again
he drops him
ill be down the hall when youre ready
betty walks off and disappears through one of the doors
deckard gets to his knees leans against the wall a mo ment then punches it with his fist
on his feet hes a little wobbly
holding his breath so he can hear above his own breathing he listens
no sign of batty
the laser is laying nearby
he doesnt bother
deckard is backing down the hall quiet as he can
he had a job to do
he would like to have done it but hes not insane
he gets to the landing and turns
on the first step down he stops
battys on the land ing below looking up at him
where you going
he wait a moment for deckards answer
a promise is a promise
ill honor the handicapped but we gotta play on the top floor
you go get your laser gun now
and ill give you a few seconds before i come
deckard turns back into the hall
deckards running down the corridor
halfway down the hall he finds his laser
deckard darts into the nearest door
the apartment above sebastians with the hole in the floor
deckard considers it
no fair jumping through holes
you might get hurt doing that
deckard dashes back into the hall chooses another door and goes in
his eyes skim over everything looking for an advantage
he throws open a door
the plumbing is dismantled walls stripped revealing brick nails protruding
battys coming up the steps
deckards looking for a corner a place that covers the angles
he chooses the far side of the room with a line to the door
battys coming down the center listening at the doors
deckards crouched in the corner and aimed
he looks at his hand
battys standing in front of a door listening
oh i wonder where he is
not in here i dont think
he goes to the next door
doesnt sound like it
batty moves to the next
the door to deckard
deckards crouched lower holding his breath talk about a hair trigger
battys feet are heard creaking away
deckard looks around
runs a hand over the wall behind him
battys feet come back
the door explodes
a shape hurtles across the room
deckard pivots fol lowing it with rapid fire
its a tv
he spins back
but battys already on him
he gets one shot off be fore battys got his hand
theres a hole over battys right eye
blood running down his face dripping on deckard
the right side of his face isnt working too good
the corner of his mouth doesnt quite shut his voice comes out slurred a little hollow
one point for you
the would doesnt minimize his omnipotence just makes it more malignant
he throws deckard against the far wall
hits batty in the shoulder
try it again
he comes at deckard jerking back and forth a cobra in fast motion faking weaving yelping with excitement as deckard tries to get a shot firing away until his lasers
bloody and crazed batty pushes up against him
dont you like me
im what weve made
hes backing deckard out the door
deckard trips and falls
theres fear on his face
the strength is gone
something is starting to crack
arent you a lover of faster bigger and better
deckards pedaling backwards over the floor
its time to die
deckard throws the laser at him
batty throws his head back and laughs
a one eyed colossus about to eat the world
suddenly he stops
his eye moves over the wall
he reaches out and pinches something
his lips compress as he yanks it out of the wall
its a ten penny nail
he holds it out to deckard and drops it
deckard catches it
thats for you
one side of battys face smiles savagely
stick it in your ear and push
if that doesnt work try the eye
deckard stares at the nail in his hand then up at his executioner
believe me itll be better for you than what im about to do
batty watches him hoping the stimulus might inspire his victim to more action
it doesnt look like it
deckard springs to his feet and bolts
but instead of going for the stairwell he turns in the first available door
batty smiles and walks lei surely towards the door
deckards terrified scream and the sound of glass crashing stop him
batty speeds up and moves into the room
the window pane is splattered curtains sucked out bellowing in the wind
he walks up to the window
deckard comes away from the wall inching up behind him laser in both hands aimed at the base of battys skull
batty starts to lean over but even before his eyes see the pavement he knows
deckard fires again
this one goes home
batty falls like he was poleaxed hits the floor dead weight
deckard starts to tremble
his arms go limp as his head tilts back and he closes his eyes
he can breathe again
on the floor battys hand is crawling toward deckards ankle
with the unsuspected abruptness of a man slipping on a banana peel deckard comes down
face knotted in hor ror he empties the laser in battys body but the hand holds on
with a screech of frustration he drops the laser and like an animal claws at battys dead fingers but the fingers are welded shut
deckard starts to crawl pulling batty behind him
he struggled through the door and stumbles to his feet
deckard plunges down the corridor dragging batty along
he falls gets to one foot falls again and crawls the last couple feet to the stairwell
groaning he tugs and pulls hauls and heaves battys body to the edge of the landing
he pauses for breath then lays back wedging his feet against battys shoul ders and pushes
inch by inch the body goes over the edge
then all at once it drops
but the hand holds and the weight of the body takes deckard with it
as deckard slides over the edge he grabs hold of the railing
deckards hanging three hundred feet over the basement floor supporting himself and battys corpse almost four hundred pounds of stress on his fingers
with his free foot he chops away at battys hand try ing to break it loose
but its not working
deckards fingers are starting to slip
his face is a mask of agony as he wedges his heel over battys thumb
with the help of gravity and everything hes got in his right leg to push with he pushes
the thumb breaks loose
the sound of his body hitting below sounds good but deckard doesnt notice
hes in an awkward position
he must reverse the way hes facing to pull himself up
he lets go with his right hand and crosses it over the left
then turns the left around so hes got an over hand grip
like a man doing his last pull up
the one that cant be done deckard pulls himself up throws a foot over the edge and grapples and heaves and wiggled himself onto the cold solid steel of the
and lies there body jerking spasmodically slowly clenching and unclenching his cramped hand but its his burning cheek against the cool metal hes most aware of
dizzy hot lungs on fire he stands and putting one foot in front of the other deckard descends the stairs
slowly the door pushes open and deckard comes out into the morning
the sun isnt yet risen but the sky has begun to pale
its a brooding gray stew of a dawn not very pretty but even though he cant show it deckard is glad to see it
for a moment he tilts his head back and takes some breath then walks across the courtyard towards the street so dead on his feet he hasnt the energy to
deckard slumps into the shelter of his car
the col lapses on the front seat
in a corner of the dimness deckard sits slumped on a chair facing the pearly gray light of the window
the only sound in the room is the soft steady breathing that comes from the bed
quietly he gets up and walks over to her
rachael lies sleeping one delicate arm exposed from under the sheet
deckard stands there bettered and grim staring down at her
moments go by and finally he sits gently on the edge of the bed
rachael opens her eyes and looks up at him she smiles
deckards car is skimming over the narrow highway
he and rachael in the front seat
except for the occasion al glance their faces are still and quiet in the cold shine of an icy dream
the clouds overhead are soft and swift
she wanted to go to a place i knew
out of the city
like one of those pictures she saw
where there were trees but no buildings
rachaels face in the window watching the woods stream by
we had a good time
she told me a funny story and i taught her a song
a song about monkeys and elephants
and it made us laugh so hard we couldnt sing
deckard and rachael walking
the land lays white and hushed before them
down an aisle of maples and beeches
the frosty light slanting through the clean hard limbs
the crisp blue white snow underfoot melted through in spots exposing soggy patches of rich brown earth
rachael stops and faces him
her lips are parted her warm breath turning the cold air to vapor
looking lithe and fragile by these barren rooted trees she stands in the crisp white snow looking at deckard
nothing in her retreats even now her eyes insist on knowing
deckard walking over the snow
he walks slowly mechanically through the cold unaffected by it
his gaunt face empty of expression except for the tears running down his pale cheeks
but for the squeak of his wet shoes over the crusted snow there is no sound
and deckard recedes into the silence of the freezing white landscape
deckards car solid throbbing gunning along like some metal animal
headlights piercing the dark of the long flat road
whistling speed of air and tires spin ning thrum
and then silence
and the silence astounded by the crack of a gun
deckard is behind the wheel face in shadow eyes star ing straight ahead
i told myself over and over again if i hadnt done it they would have
i didnt go back to the city not that city i didnt want the job
she said the great advantage of being alive was to have a choice
and she chose
and a part of me was almost glad
not because she was gone but because this way they could never touch her
as for tyrell he was murdered but he wasnt dead
for a long time i wanted to kill him
but what was the point
there were too many tyrells
but only one rachael
maybe real and unreal could never be separated
the secret never found
but i got as close with her as id ever come to it
shed stay with me a long time
i guess we made each other real
and the ruby lights of deckards car disappear into the darkness
