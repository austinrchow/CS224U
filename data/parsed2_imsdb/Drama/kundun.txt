a still photograph a portrait of a mountain the north face of chomolungma a peak also known as mount everest twenty nine thousand feet high
we hear a very young boy speak
mama my story
a woman speaks again
portrait of a mountain khangbochen craggy peaks covered with snow twenty four thousand feet high
your father had been very ill we thought he would die and some animals had died
portrait of a mountain shishapangma twenty six thousand feet high
and a yak
and we had four years of bad crops all the farmers did
portrait of a mountain anye machin ii twenty thousand feet high and slightly obscured by clouds
in the night i knew you were coming
now the foothills
the still photograph of this barren mountain range comes to life as we see something moving
it is a small caravan traveling this narrow mountain pass
at dawn you were born
closer on this caravan
we can make out eight or ten men walking and on horseback dressed in heavy brocade coats and large woolen hats black braids trailing down their backs
a yellow palanquin is carried by four large monks wearing maroon robes
the caravan reaches the top of the mountain pass and turns a sudden shift in direction a switchback
the travelers head downhill
now we see the menss destination
an incredibly blue circular lake sunk between snow dusted mountains
it is lhamo i latso the oracle lake and it shimmers in the sunlight
as the lake comes into view a young man pushes back the curtain of the yellow palanquin and peers down at it
the man is dressed in royal robes
he is young twenty four years old
his name is reting rinpoche
he is the regent of tibet
the color of the lake changes from brilliant turquoise to a deep murky unfathomable darkness
you were a beautiful baby
the woman laughs
maybe just a little
the palanquin is set down on a flat rock overlooking the lake
the waters color changes again to a deep purple then blue again then red then indigo
and that day your father got better
he named you lhamo
the noblemen and monks surround reting as he steps out of the palanquin
one man stands out here a monk a high lama in fact with a kind face and fantastic mesmerizing eyes
he is the lama go to sleep lhamo
reting stares at the lake
the water turns a light grey and an image appears obscure at first then becoming more solid
he sees a house a small stone one story u shaped house
the house has a flat tile roof and an unusual wooden rain gutter with windows outlined in black and a prayer flag in the courtyard
a spotted dog is in front of the house barking though we cannot hear him
the vision becomes completely clear for an instant clear enough to see the face of a young boy at the window
close on reting rinpoche
cut to a portrait of a mountain kyeri a majestic glacier mountain the house mountain of the village of takster amdo province north eastern tibet
sound returns as the wind whistles around this jagged mountain peak and then the view moves down below the tree line and into the rhododendron forest and the farmlands until
it comes to rest on a small stone u shaped house
a house caught in the dawns mist
close on the face of a sleeping child a boy lhamo dhondrup age two and one half years
he is dreaming
he is about to wake up
today his life will change
we stay on the boys face until slowly his eyes open beautiful dark eyes
the mother walks past the boy her woolen skirt swaying in the rosy light
a seven year old brother lobsang samten and a teenage sister tsering dolma share lhamos kitchen mattress
lhamo looks at them and then he turns to see the heavy felt boots of his father as the man walks through the room and out the door
lhamo finds the kind face of his mother
she is looking at him
the boy walks across the stone courtyard as we hear the sounds of this country morning the snorting of horses clucking of hens a command from the father as the
man feeds the animals
the boy scratches he pees
he sees his mother on the roof
she is a silhouette against the dawn as she feeds cedar and yak chips into the incense burner sending white curly smoke up to circle the prayer flag and its
clusters of printed mantras
we pull back as the spotted dog begins to bark
lhamos house is the house in the vision
it is a good day
there is cheese for breakfast
lhamos father sits on a cushion at the head of a low table
fresh bread appears yogurt roasted barley tsampa
lhamo pushes at his father
this must stop
i am the father
you sit there
what is the harm
he will grow up all wrong
only you can serve him only you can wash his bowl
too tidy everything just so
he must know his place
he thinks he is king here
what is the harm
the father reluctantly gets up and gives his seat to lhamo
lhamo settles and waits for his mother to hand him his bowl of tsampa
he bestows a most beautiful smile on his family
the father is leaving the yard with a short string of horses when there is a sudden commotion
the chinese governor is passing through this little village
he is a ferocious looking man dressed in ornate brocade his horse eguipped with tack that looks like armor
he is surrounded by a dozen chinese soldiers all on huge horses ruling the road kicking up mud
lhamos father stops
he holds still
he looks to the house
the mother is holding the children against her in the doorway
the governor and his entourage move on
when they are out of sight lhamos father makes his departure
lhamo straddles the window sill slapping his bottom as if he were a horse shouting i go away
look mama i go away
far far far
his mother is making bread in the kitchen
where will he go
far far away
lhamo is playing a game with pebbles on the raised wooden platform in the kitchen
the fire is lit
he is alone
the dog begins to bark
please come in so cold
we are traveling to lhasa
of course please this way
your servant may use the kitchen
a middle aged man the servant wearing heavy ragged clothes and wrapped boots enters the kitchen
lhamo slides over so that the man can sit on the platform beside him
the man picks up a few pebbles and drops them he knows the game
we recognize this servant
his name is keustang rinpoche
he is one of the monks we saw at the oracle lake the one with the mesmerizing eyes
keustang rinpoche is the lama of sera monastery
lhamo sees a dark brown rosary around the servants neck and immediately pulls at the string of beads
the servant takes the rosary off and gives it to the boy
lhamo hangs the string of beads around his own neck
the servant makes a move to take back the rosary but lhamo resists
i will give it to if you can tell me who i am
lhamo looks up into the mans piercing black eyes
the lama of sera
the mother enters and immediately sees the rosary around her sons neck
she gives it back to the servant
lhamo goes back to his game
the mother hands the tired man a slice of bread and a steaming cup of tea
the mans hands are shaking
he cannot look the woman in the eye
the travelers make their departure at dawn
as the party reaches the gate lhamo runs from the house crying wait
the men stop
lhamo runs to the servant
me go too
lhamo is in tears
no no no
he always says he will travel far away
he always wants to go
we cannot young master
you come back
the travelers head down the road
mother and child return to their home the mother carrying the boy on her hip as he swings himself around to take a last look at the strangers
the father readies a pack train of horses
lobsang and lhamo pull on the cinche straps
the mother plows with a heavy yoke attached to a large yak
lobsang samten and tsering dolma help their mother
lhamo sleeps under an umbrella
lobsang and lhamo running carrying a bowl of eggs
lobsang is wrapped in maroon wool trying to hold still as his mother pins and stitches
lhamo sits sipping tea watching woefully
say kumbum monastery
it is not far away
it is not far at all and it is a beautiful place
and your big brother is abbott there
you will not be alone
i will be very smart
you will be fine
you will be a fine monk
lobsang pours water from one small copper bowl into six others seven in all placed on an altar before a statue of buddha
as the rest of the family watches the mother lights the butter lamps whispering om mani padme hum
om mani padme hum
lobsang is perched on the back of a horse in front of his father
the two leave home goodbyes having already been said
mother sister and little brother remain behind
mother lies down with lhamo holding him
your father had been very sick
he had been sick from the time you began growing in me
we thought he would die
a cow had died
one night you stopped all your moving and i said to your sister his time has come
first break of day
at dawn you were born
one eye was closed and your sister opened it with her thumb
we gave you the sweet drink
his mother laughs
we washed you and wrapped you in sheepskin and took you to your father
that day he father got better and that day a pair of crows came to nest in our roof
i just remembered
i miss my brother
i miss him too
close on the mother as she holds lhamo now her only son at home
a view of kyeri mountain turning from a pre dawn purple to light pink in the sunlight
the multi colored prayer flags flap in the wind as the cock crows and the animals come awake
father exits the house and begins his day
lhamo is watching two bugs fighting when he hears the dog bark
he climbs the low stone wall and looks out at the road
six travelers approach
four of the men are dressed as nobility wearing red and gold silk
two men are monks
the mother meets the men in the courtyard
a monk steps forward
i am the lama of sera
we have business here
lhamo jumps off the wall
he carefully lifts the smaller beetle from the path of the larger beetle
he places the rescued bug safely in a clump of grass
close on the faces of the six men
close on the small face of lhamo as he looks down at the bed
lying on a piece of yellow silk are many objects
there are three of each type of object three walking sticks three drums three silver pens three eating bowls three bells three rosaries three pairs of spectacles
the lama of sera keustang rinpoche hands lhamo the rosary he had so coveted when the man first visited
this is yours you say
what else belongs to you
lhamo considers the request then climbs onto the bed to study the objects
the drum and the bell he chooses quickly
keustang rinpoche watches the boy gather the items
he looks at the yellow silk and the boys small fine hands
he dares not look directly at the boy
lhamo picks up one walking stick a lovely bronze handled one
he swings it around but he finally rejects it in favor of a plain iron handled stick
he makes his own pile of these things then looks at the lama of sera
yes those are yours
keustang rinpoche takes the boys hands in his own
he turns them over examines them
the lama carefully pulls back the boys overalls
there is a little birthmark like a conch shell on his shoulder
keustang rinpoche pulls up the boys pants legs
there is a funny skin marking on the legs like tiger stripes
the lama rearranges the boys clothing then one more time takes the beautiful little hands in his own and whispers kundun he says to the others in a soft secretive
voice he is the presence
in the background by an open curtain we see lhamos mother
she says softly my oldest boy is an incarnation
so is your youngest
keustang releases the boys hands and brings his own closed palms up to his forehead
i wish you long life
the mother begins to cry
little lhamo now dressed in yellow fills the copper water bowls with difficulty
his parents stand beside him
they share one frightened curious look
close on the statue of buddha
it is an image of chenrezig the buddha of compassion
he has eleven heads and four outstretched arms
lhamo sits in the saddle in front of his mother
his father and sister ride beside them through an incredible empty tibetan landscape
a monk rides lead
turquoise roof golden pagoda a beautiful white washed monastery built against a terraced green hillside of amdo
mother pats her son lhamos unruly hair and makes a soft comforting sound
lobsang is there beside his brother
lobsang is already dressed as a tiny monk in a maroon robe with short clipped hair an older brother takster age a lama is there
the mother lies i will be back in a few days
lhamo holds up two fingers
your brothers are here
takster moves closer
she places the sad youngster in taksters arms
one more kiss
lhamo kisses her as does lobsang and even takster falls into her arms for a moment
then she turns and goes quickly
a monk appears
he produces a concertina and begins to play for the little boy
but lhamo begins to cry through the music through the hugs of his brothers
as a result of lhamos tears lobsang begins to cry
takster holds them both
the music continues
the older wiser takster begins to cry too
the three brothers hold one another
three brothers three monks crying for their mother
the music continues echoing in this stone monastery
the young kundun is gently rocked by his older brother
he begins to fall asleep
the sound of the concertina becomes chanting and we see row after row of monks in a temple their voices mingling in the empty room
view of a courtyard with young novices reciting
lobsang is among them
may i be the doctor and the medicine and may i be the nurse for all sick beings in the world until everyone is healed
a teacher a very stern looking monk carrying a thick flat board menacingly behind his back walks among the students
a golden head of a buddha a huge head appears to be bursting through an archway at the end of a dark hallway
the chinese governor stands like a giant against the blue sky
i want him accompanied by my chinese soldiers
keustang rinpoche also a head against blue sky argues this is tibet
we are not under your authority
close on the chinese governor
i want one hundred thousand chinese dollars if you want the boy
close on keustang rinpoche
slowly he nods
an image of the father and the mother standing in their courtyard staring at the departing search party
the mother asks over and over but why
who is lhamo
who do they say he is
her husband does not know
view of the mother on the roof feeding cedar and yak chips into the incense burner
we hear boys reciting may i be protector for those without one
lhamo wakes up
he is in a brilliant green room
the stern looking teacher from his dream is there reading scripture reciting may i be a bridge a boat a ship for all who wish to cross the water
lhamo looks down at the complicated words
can you recite
the boy just waits sad lonely
the teacher offers lhamo an apricot
lhamo takes the fruit
the monk pats the boys head gently and lhamo takes shelter in the kind mans massive robes
the view becomes sunlight through deep maroon wool
thamo and lobsang sit inside a idreljam a rough palanquin which is attached to two poles and carried between two mules
the vehicle rises and falls pitches and twists as it is carried along the roadless tibetan plains
lhamo reaches forward and pulls back a curtain
the boy is traveling with a caravan
it is not in fact an enormous caravan maybe fifty people including lhamos family members of the search party monks muslim traders
the dreljam driver looks over at lhamo and signals that the boy should close the curtain
lhamo does so only to lean across his brother to look out the other side of his tiny carriage
the other side opens to a view of the great empty land
a herd of deer grazes beside the travelers
mountains rise in the distance
a flock of geese flies overhead
lhamo closes the curtain
lhamo elbows his brother
lobsang elbows him back
the two begin to squabble
you have all the room
dont be a baby move over
you think you are so big
they hit and pinch until finally the movement of the carriage stops
the driver reaches in through the open curtains and separates the boys each to his own side of the dreljam
inside his tiny carriage young lhamo now sits quiet and composed
a cluster of fantastic tibetan tents are set up white cotton tents with sharp corners peaked ceilings and elaborate appliqued designs
campfires glow animals bed down stars shine overhead
close on a group of ancient stern faced monks
close on the baby faced lhamo dhondrup
one monk pulls a huge pair of scissors from his robes
lhamo makes a dive for the tents door
standing outside the tent is a bodyguard a huge burly man wearing monks robes
he turns to the boy
in one hand he holds a big stick
his face is distorted and deformed by a large tumor under one eye
it is a frightening sight
he looks like a monster to the child
lhamo jumps back inside the tent
the bodyguard closes the appliqued flap
lhamo has had a haircut
his mother walks beside the carriage holding his hand
who am i
we do not know
by candlelight lhamo is transferred from the rugged simple carriage to one of exquisite yellow silk
lhamo peeks out of the silk curtain as he hears the arrival of many horses many men
soldiers hundreds of tibetan soldiers surround the palanquin
the yellow palanquin is carried across a human border of tibetan noblemen
these fantastic looking men and women part and drop to the ground in prostration as the palanquin moves through their welcoming committee
lhamo walks along a long patterned carpet looking up at this lofty tents stunning blue silk ceiling
he is led to a tall wooden throne and he is lifted and then he climbs to the top
lhamo settles in a cross legged position on the brocade cushion
he looks down
hundred of monks abbots noblemen nepalese bhutanese chinese even a red headed englishman they all bow to lhamo
reting rinpoche the young regent of tibet the man who saw this boys face in his vision stands below the throne
he addresses the crowd chenrezi the buddha of compassion
the wish fulfilling jewel
the fourteenth dalai lama
and the regent turns hikes up his gorgeous robes and prostrates before the child
in the crowd stand lhamos mother and father and lobsang samten
on their faces we must see that they did not realize who their son their brother was believed to be
first the mother and then the father bow in front of their youngest child
long life lhamo
we hear the sound of a great tibetan horn
we hear peels of childish laughter
lobsang and lhamo skid slide skate down the endless slippery hallways of this huge labyrinthine monastery
three monks scurry behind the boys trying to keep up trying to keep the young incarnate from slipping out of their sight
they shout in loud stage whispers kundun
the monks are no match for the little boys who are quickly out of sight
reting rinpoche sits cross legged on the floor of this brightly painted red room
across from him sits lhamo dressed in fine yellow silk
these are simple rooms decorated with statues deity scrolls and mandalas an altar to buddha
behind a glass case are toys mixed in with the buddhist artifacts dolls puppets balls blocks trains
reting rinpoche is speaking
centuries ago a young boy was born
his name was gedundrub
the night of his birth robbers came to his home and his family fled hiding the baby in a cattle pen
when they returned the next day the baby was safe
they found him guarded by a pair of black crows
he was the first dalai lama
the living buddha of compassion
now you have chosen to come back to this life once again
reting blows his nose
we name you tenzin gyatso
close on lhamo tenzin gyatso
your job is simple
you are to love all living things
just love them
care for them
have compassion for them
as long as any living thing draws breath wherever he shall be there in compassion shall the buddha appear incarnate
at the curtain behind lhamo we notice the curly toed shoes of a monk a man who must be standing in the next room
in the room immediately adjacent to this bedroom we now see the three monks who chased the young boy down the slippery halls
they are the dalai lamas personal attendants the master of the ritual the master of the kitchen and the master of the robe
it is the master of the kitchen who stands directly behind the curtain
the lord chamberlain is also there
he is a monk
a tall angular man with almost nordic features large round eyes a yellowish mustache sharp nose
all of these men will become quite familiar to us as will the man standing listening behind the attendants
he is a sweeper a man named norbu thundrup age thirty
he is tall and gangly with a wispy beard and a pock marked face
you will be the leader of the tibetan people when you come of age
until that time i will be your teacher and as your regent i will rule in your name
i will tell your lord chamberlain you are ready to see him
the regent walks through this room on his way out
a passing look from norbu lets us know that reting rinpoche is not well liked
he will see you now
the lord chamberlain goes to meet with the dalai lama
the lord chamberlain bows to the boy and then unpacks his parcel
he has a rolled parchment document
he has a beautiful carved wooden box
the lord chamberlain points to the mural on the wall behind the boy
it is an elaborate story painting
fifth dalai lama
the boy looks
the lord chamberlain points to a golden statue of a round man in a peaked hat
seventh dalai lama
tenzin gyatso nods
the lord chamberlain lifts a framed photograph of a bald charismatic man with razor sharp eyebrows pictured sitting on a throne
thirteenth dalai lama
the boy looks at the photo
the lord chamberlain places the state seal in the young boys hands and indicates that the boy should bring the heavy instrument down hard on the parchment
the boy does
the lord chamberlain scribbles a little something on a tab of attached paper then bows to the boy
fourteenth dalai lama
outside up a country path young herders lead their cattle in from the grazing fields
we can hear the boys singing a tibetan street song
i am the good one
you be bad
the bad man
the view comes in the window and reveals the young dalai lama sitting on the floor with norbu thundrup the sweeper
tenzin gyatso has arranged a battlefield of soldiers little men made of colored dough
my name is norbu holiness
i will be good you be bad
tenzin gyatso is ferocious in his strategy taking norbus men
im on a big mountain and hitting at the bad men
and after the game were going to trade
you just stay over there no there
norbu and i will shoot at you
i want your land
i take it
i am stronger
i am braver
norbu thundrup plays like a child
it is a fight to the finish
i have more men
norbu thundrup i have smarter men
tenzin gyatso has lost he dissolves into tears
today you lose
tomorrow you may win
norbu snaps his fingers
things change kundun
why is your beard so funny
let me touch this
tenzin touches the soft bald chin of norbu
and then tenzin gyatso tries to snap his fingers
tenzin gyatso stands at the window watching listening
his hands knead the colored dough into balls ready to create the next army the future battleground as he recites softly as long as all living draw breaths there buddha
norbu thundrup smiles as he polishes the floor clearing it of tsampa dough
the great hall in the potala is the seat of tibetan government
these palace walls are hung with beautiful old thangkas silk embroideries or paintings depicting the life of buddha
inside the hall sits the acting government the yigstang and the tsitang four monks four laymen all dressed in their appropriate simplicity and elaborateness
these men sit in two rows facing one another
the senior monk and the senior layman sit a bit forward
they are the speakers
the senior layman is on his knees speaking
i believe that the regent is asking for too high a reward for his part in finding the dalai lama
too much money too much land
tenzin gyatso peeks through a door at the great assembly
the lord chamberlian stands behind him
the layman continues
our treasuries are empty
our army is depleted
he would have us pull the hair from our noses
the dalai lama is confused but continues listening
the layman returns to his cross legged position
the senior monk speaks
we note this
now the chinese
there is audible expression of tension
the allies wish to build a supply road from india crossing tibet as part of their war effort
the road would lead directly to china
the layman gets to his knees
we cannot allow it
right now we have a only a small chinese mission in lhasa the first since the thirteenth dalai lama threw them out in
the road would increase the size of that mission
the chinese would try to control our trade as they did once before control our contact with the outside world
the lord chamberlain touches the boys shoulder and tenzin gyatso leaves his hiding place as the speakers voice fades away
as the two walk down the hallway tenzin gyatso spots an unusual wooden door
he lets the lord chamberlain get a little bit ahead of him and then the boy tries the door
it is heavy
it almost opens
tenzin gyatso and his brother lobsang are pulling at the heavy door
behind them in the distance we hear kundun
the door opens
the boys disappear inside
a treasure awaits them
it looks like aladdins cave full of odd european items
there are glittering music boxes a porcelain sink a gilded mirror a lacquered rocking horse
there are hats umbrellas and even a pair of lace up cordovan shoes
tenzin gyatso lifts a reel of film
there are piles of magazines and books
there is a stack of tires in the back corner
the boys uncover a train set and a good collection of lead soldiers
the dalai lama pockets a gold watch
just as the monks find their young charges and we hear them at the door tenzin sees something truly spectacular
it is a telescope
the monks enter the room as the young dalai lama reaches for this miracle
what is it
ah it is a telescope holiness
with this you can see a long way
and is it mine
these are all gifts sent to your predecessors
then it is yours
i need it
we are in the adjacent room listening as norbu thundrup tells a bedtime story
golden butter lamps burn before a statue of buddha
one night not too long ago an old monk saw a woman in that very same hallway where you ran away
the boy is in bed
the sweeper finishes off his story as the boy wiggles deeper under the covers
she carried a basket in her arms a big heavy basket and the old monk cautiously approached
she opened her basket and showed what she had
only the heads
is that true or pretend
it is a story you decide
as you say
the sweeper tucks the boy in as the master of the robe finishes his nightly preparations and with a pat and a smile the two men leave the room
a mouse steals a bit of tsampa from the offerings placed on the altar before the buddha
tenzin gyatso peeks out from under his covers and looks to see if those curly toed shoes are visible under the partition
the master of the kitchen is still near
tenzin gyatso pulls the golden pocket watch from under the covers
he pries and digs at the back of the watch until he succeeds in popping it open revealing its miraculous insides
finally tenzin gyatsos eyelids grow heavy
the camera passes over his face as his eyes close
the boy begins to speak mumble as he falls asleep i be an island for those who seek one a lamp for light
we find two scrolls the first is penden lhamo the special protectress of the dalai lama
she rides her wild mule through a sea of blood between rows of jagged mountains
pointed fingers and spreading toes her hair gone crazy her fangs revealed the details are incredible
a garland of freshly severed heads hangs around her body snakes hold up her skirt five skulls form ber crown
may i be a bed for all who wish to rest and a slave for all who want a slave
beside her on the second scroll is mahakala
he is the fierce representation of the buddha of compassion
crows fly in the clouds to the left of the terrifying black six armed figure
a skull rosary is held in the upper right arm a trident is held in the left hand
the deity wears a crown of five skulls
he has three eyes
he tramples an elephant
we might have been in a dream as the camera finally moves back to find the peaceful protected face of the young dalai lama
the camera moves across the mural devoted to the story of the fifth dalai lama
it is a fantasy of green with mountains and lakes and deities and monsters
we find the statue of seventh dalai lama sitting on his golden cushion and we look deep into the eyes of the thirteenth dalai lama
may i be wishing jewel a magic vase
we see the dalai lama place his young eye at the viewfinder
norbu thundrup holds the boy steady
and a wondorous view of lhasa is presented
vendors hawk their goods to elegant ladies wearing turquoise jewelry and carrying silken parasols
animals are herded through town by young boys
children play and squabble
a white wall is covered with cartoons lampoons political posters picturing the regent perhaps as a man holding too much power
i want to go down there
you can only go with attendants and a big ceremony
i want to run down the street
i want to buy a toy
eat from the shops
i want to be a shepherd taking those goats and cows out to the hillside
but you are not a shepherd you are the dalai lama
maybe in the next life the world will not need a dalai lama
nornu thundrup i would not know
the view travels and we see a prison yard
shackled men share the yard with hairy fat dogs
one man looks up and sees that the yard is under surveillance
of course the men all know that this terrace belongs to the boy dalai lama
as the boy watches first one poor ragged man then another prostrates
tenzin gyatso pulls away from the telescope
he waves to the prisoners
the boy rides in his palanquin of yellow silk
he is older now seven or eight
he peers through the curtain
a grand procession carries the dalai lama from the potala to his summer residence the norbulinka
monks walk in procession as do members of the aristocracy wearing their finest gowns and jewelry holding their finest parasols and soldiers wearing ancient uniforms
there are horses banners and carriages
bodyguards carry the dalai lamas possessions wrapped in yellow silk
a band plays god save the king
it is a magnificent display and along the side of the road tibetans prostrate in the presence of the boy not daring to look at him
establishing shot of this lovely park
zt looks like a sweet summer home compared to the looming expansiveness of the potala
it is filled with deer and antelope peacocks and nesting birds
an eccentric collection of trees grow here some indigenous some gifts bearing flowers and fruit
there are fish ponds and even a kyichu river tributary nearby
we find the young dalai lama standing by this tributary daring to put one foot on a slippery stepping stone
an attendant gently pulls him back
beyond the river a herder leads a small group of braying sheep towards town
the boy watches
he listens to the herders song
the dalai lama drops bits of food into a fish pond
he calls the huge lazy fish to come eat
little ones first only little ones
the boy pushes the bigger ones away with a stick
tenzin gyatso runs through an open gate in a mustard yellow wall which separates the dalai lamas residence from the rest of the norbulinka and up the steps leading to
a white one story home his parents
a startling blue room
the young dalai lama leans on the table where is father sits eating pork rinds
lobsang is there practicing his writing on a chalk board
tenzin gyatso grabs one pork rind then another then a third
the dalai lama is not supposed to eat pork
it is not good for your brain
the father uses the grease from the roasted lamb on the table to caress his long mustache and twirl each side into a point
the dalai lama takes another and then suddenly the boy reaches up and for no reason he pulls on his fathers mustache obviously hurting the man
the father slaps the boys hand hard
the boy sits back and begins drawing imaginary letters on the tabletop with his slapped hand
his father reaches out and takes the hurt hand
he pulls the boy into his arms
i am sorry lhamo
it is alright father
the master of the robe knocks at the door
father and son look up
kundun you must come back now
the young boy sits straight up on his fathers lap and says defiantly go away
the surprised monk backs away from the door
not the way to talk to people
can i do anything i want
but i am in charge
the boy thinks
can i save the sheep from going to the market
so they dont die
you could buy them
do i have money
what do you think
do you have money
i do now
and you have horses
you love horses
i do beautiful horses
thank you holiness
will you buy the sheep for me
where will you keep them
well collect them
i will buy them for you
can i free the prisoners
you cant do anything real until you are dalai lama
i am him
not until you are eighteen
you have escaped once more
the mother has been in the doorway listening
tenzin gyatso disengages from his fathers arms and goes to his mother
tenzin reaches into one of her large apron pockets and finds nothing
he reaches into her sash and pulls out a special looking sweet
she takes the boys hand and leads him from the house
i get in trouble if you do not study
lobsang looks at his father
sometimes you strike the goat to scare the sheep
i am the goat
he is a naughty sheep
he will not be ours much longer
close on the fathers face
the mother walks the boy back to his residence through the gate in the yellow wall
i have news
the regent has resigned his post
is he a bad man
norbu says he is lavish and willful
how can he give you monks vows if he has not kept them himself
well some say
its not for you to worry about
another will be chosen
he was always nice to me
he found me
he saw me in his dreams
they have reached the residence
the boys mother caresses his little head
i turn you over again today lhamo
one day you will not be able to come running to us
but you will always be here
you will always
i have one more piece of news
a baby is coming
tenzin grabs at her stomach and shrieks with laughter
who will it be
the mother places her hands on tenzin gyatsos
who can it be
a string of old monks stand waiting for the naughty boy
the boy runs up the stairs and towards the old men but he stops and looks at a small cabinet standing unobtrusively in a corner
tenzin gyatso goes to the cabinet and rattles the locked door
my teeth are in here
a monk takes the boy by the hand and leads him down a hallway
my old teeth
a bell and a dorge are laid out on a small table
tenzin gyatso sits in front of this table
a monk is chanting in low deep tones in the background
the dalai lamas teacher taktra rinpoche sits on the floor
being the teacher taktra rinpoche sits slightly higher than the dalai lama
taktra is an older man in his sixties
he is stern solid no nonsense
taktra rinpoche begins a prayer
i take refuge in the three jewels the buddha the dharma and the sangra
but the boy leaps up from his table and goes to taktra and hangs around his neck shouting you recite
taktra gives the boy just the slightest of looks
i take refuge in the three jewels the buddha the dharma and the sangra
tenzin gyatso releases the lama and goes back to his own table
until i attain enlightenment
taktra rinpoche has a small table with the same hand instruments in front of him
the teacher lifts the dorge in a particular fashion and rotates it
tenzin gyatso lifts his dorge
taktras hands move to the boys and show him the correct movement
it is tried again
now the bell is lifted and rung
i would like you to be my new regent
he nods to the boy
as the chanting continues taktra rinpoche begins a weaving motion with his hands delicate beautiful hypnotic
tenzin gyatso copies the elder
we are close on the boys moving hands
the chanting becomes the voices of a hundred men as we fade out
fade in on the boys hands but they are a little larger they are the hands of an eleven or twelve year old boy and the motion they carry out
is on the verge of becoming extraordinarily beautiful
tenzin gyatso sits alone in a small dark green room
he is older
his robes have changed slightly his manner is more refined more dignified
he is on a retreat
there is a soft knock at the door
the door is opened and food is placed inside the small room by bodiless hands
tenzin gyatso collects his food
he sips his tea and eats his tsampa while reading from a long narrow stack of scriptures
thangkas of milerapa the great tibetan poet and teacher hang on the walls
we notice the curly toed shoes of the master of the kitchen just visible beneath the wooden door
the boy walks alone moving to the rhythm of a memorization
his breath consolidates in the cold night air
the sky is brilliant with stars
tenzin gyatso reciting as long as any living thing draws breath wherever he shall be there in compassion shall the buddha appear incarnate
school is in session
ling rinpoche is teaching
ling is a young shy brilliant monk with a very round face
he is now senior tutor
the four noble truths
tenzin gyatso sitting cross legged on a cushion responds
the four noble truths as taught by the lord sakyamuni buddha are the truth of suffering the truth of the cause of suffering the truth of the cessation of suffering
the truth of the way which leads to the cessation of suffering
i accept it
what is suffering
true suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions
birth illness grief old age poverty pain death these are surferings
i accept it
what are the causes of suffering
the causes of suffering arise from true sources
attachment desire envy hatred greed unkindness wrong view and so forth these are some causes of suffering
now we cut back to ling rinpoche but he is standing outside in a courtyard
he asks another question but he raises his right hand as he speaks and lowers his left completing the question with a clap of the hands
it is a beautiful blue sky day
the dalai lama is learning debate
high lamas sit on tapestry pillows under appliqued canopies observing
young monks can be seen watching from a greater distance
the lord chamberlain sits to one side
taktra rinpoche now regent is beside him
the dalai lama sits on the ground at lings feet
how does one progress from the realization of one noble truth to another
clap a long silence from his holiness
the lamas wait on tender hooks
finally the boy says we will have to think about that
there is laughter
even ling rinpoche laughs and the boy erupts into his beautiful free easy laugh
i need to squeeze this brain
clap a pause and then when one understands that he causes some of his own suffering needlessly then he looks for the causes in his own life
and when and he looks for those causes when he investigates then he is putting confidence in his own ability to eliminate the sources and end the suffering
a wish to find a path to peace arises
for all beings desire happiness
all wish to find their purest selves
ling nods in approval
he looks to the elders
i accept it
taktra rinpoche and the lord chamberlain are proud
tenzin gyatso runs up a slant board and leaps off the edge a big jump a flying leap
he falls to the ground then gets up laughing and runs up the board again
the same old monks who watched him debate watch him play
the lord chamberlain and taktra rinpoche are among them
the lord chamberlain obviously loves watching his young charge play
the regent is not so sure
tenzin gyatso shouts i need to jump
i love to jump
the nechung oracle is the protective deity of tibet
tonight he is in full trance
it is an amazing sight
the monk who is his medium spins and twirls he wags his heavy headdress about
a round mirror glitters on his chest
sweat pours from his brow over his wildly grimacing face
the oracle spits at the government officials in the room
horns blow cymbals crash incense burns
the oracle nears the dalai lama and retreats from him
finally he whispers in the boys ear
heed the warning of your predecessor
or the war will end here
and then the oracle gently straightens tenzin gyatsos yellow robes before the trance ends and the oracle falls into the arms of his attendants
wind whistles through the potalas hallways and porticos
the master of the kitchen is clearing away the dinner dishes
the view of the floor reveals that a toy war is being waged
with a meccano set the young dalai lama has created what looks like an airplane and a tank
these vehicles are manned by beautifully detailed lead soldiers british world war one field soldiers french legionaries and american artillery men
norbu thundrup is flying low with a tsampa dough airplane
he drops little tsampa dough bombs from his hand
he hits a tank and knocks down a few lead soldiers
oh nicely done norbu
i will get you
the lord chamberlain enters
may i listen to the news with you holiness
a large old fashioned short wave radio broadcasts that there is still a real war in progress
the bbc report is of the pacific front
how big is tibets army
roughly five thousand men
is that big
not very big
the regent is adding men
and he bought rifles and ammunition from india
mountain guns too
the broadcast reports news of the civil war in china
will we be in this war
this war is almost over
will we ever be in war
the lord chamberlain is silent
we have enemies
but surely we are safe in tibet
we dont believe in killing
no we dont
tenzin gyatso gets to his feet and takes an atlas from his table
he lays the book open on the floor
this is britain
where is poland
the lord chamberlain sits on the floor
he points to poland
where is pearl harbor
the master of the kitchen comes to look at the atlas
in the pacific ocean
it is an island
where is alsace
i do not know holiness
tenzin gyatso turns to a well thumbed page tibet
this is tibet
and this is china
they all look at huge china
certainly we are safe in tibet
no one answers
finally as norbu thundrup begins to gather up the tsampa dough we hope kundun
tenzin gyatso turns to the lord chamberlain
what was the warning of the thirteenth dalai lama
he warned about the future of tibet
when it is time
his holiness works on an old movie projector
a white haired chinese monk works with him
the old monk has very little patience
he bangs his hand on the table and huffs and puffs as the two try again to fiddle with this and that
tenzin gyatso works diligently and calmly
patience is the first of the six perfections
the old monk mutters something in chinese
they thread a roll of dusty film into the reel and spin the wheel
the film breaks
the old monk bangs the table again
the work continues
one day we will get that automobile running
the monks slaps his head in horrid anticipation
a movie begins shown on a piece of cloth tacked to a wall
it is a newsreel footage from world war one
the boy goes up to the cloth screen and touches it gently playing with his own shadow as men dash from foxholes across a muddy body strewn field
the boy steps back and stares at the horror of real war men sleeping in the muddy foxholes make shift hospitals tend the dying
youths not much older than his holiness weep into their filthy bloody hands
the old monk keeps his trembling hand on the noisy hand operated projector
tenzin gyatso slowly sits cross legged on the bare floor
war does not look good on film
the boy sits alone in front of his altar praying
a black room lit by butter lamps
taktra rinpoche and tenzin gyatso sit opposite one another cross legged on the floor
taktra is the teacher he sits a bit higher
the room is a shrine to mahakala the dalai lamas personal deity
mahakala is present in the form of a huge golden statue
the boy has his head bent low to catch the rinpoches words
there is much gesturing much murmuring
we might catch only a word or two
an oral teaching is being passed on a lineage teaching
it is sacred and secret
close on a thangka of penden lhamo
we hear monks debating
it is ling rinpoche answering playing the student
to be born in a time when the buddha has appeared
to be born in a time when the buddha has taught
to be born when the teaching of buddha is alive
we find his holiness sitting listening to the debate
to be born where the dharma is practiced
to be born in a time when people have compassion for other people
the view widens now and we are under a softly billowing appliqued canopy
maybe fifty monks and lamas are present
this is an informal group
how is human life precious
as a result of previous karma you have obtained this human life
by means of this rebirth through work and study you can attain all everlasting happiness
in the words of shantideva with the boat of this precious life you can cross the waters of samsara
how rare to find this boat
oh ignorant one do not fall asleep now
shots ring out
the men jump to their feet and rush out from under the canopy
the dalai lama is right in front
more shots as the men stare out across the countryside
we hear murmurs of sera sera monastery
the army is taking him right past sera
those crazy monks
have been threatening trouble
reting tried to assassinate taktra rinpoche
we hear these snippets as the dalai lama runs from the group
it is almost black inside this old building
the panting boy runs up and up and up several staircases
tenzin gyatso runs down the hall and enters his red rooms
norbu thundrup is in the room and he moves ahead of the boy out to the terrace
tenzin gyatso climbs up on a small wooden platform and mans his telescope
its the army firing on sera monastery
the shooting continues
why is this
what is happening
reting rinpoche has been arrested
he tried to overthrow regent taktra
today he is brought back to lhasa by government officials
the monks at sera monastery have been on his side
now there is trouble between them and the army
the lord chamberlain arrives on the terrace
i am sorry for you to have to witness this kundun
the lord chamberlain peers through the telescope as the shooting continues
the lord chamberlain steps away from the telescope and the boy takes his place
the shooting slowly stops
i have a letter
the boy looks up
the thirteenth dalai lamas warning
he wrote to you the year before he died
the year before you were born
the lord chamberlain walks to a far sheltered end of the terrace
tenzin gyatso slowly turns the telescope to see the prison yard
view through the telescope the yard is full of prisoners listening to the shooting
one man sees the telescope aimed at the prison and prostrates
then another and another
tenzin gyatso steps away from the telescope and turns to follow his lord chamberlain
the lord chamberlain opens a yellowing letter and begins to read
tenzin gyatso sits down beside him
it may happen that here in tibet religion and government will be attacked both from without and within
unless we guard our own country
close on the lord chamberlain
today he appears tired the whites of his eyes appear enormous
his voice is quite beautiful
it will now happen that the dalai and panchen lamas the father and the son and all the revered holders of the faith will disappear and become nameless
tenzin gyatso unwinds the rosary from his wrist and begins thumbing the brown beads
monks and their monasteries will be destroyed
the rule of law will be weakened
the lands and properties will be seized
they themselves will be forced to serve their enemies or wander the country like beggars
all beings will be sunk in great hardship and overwhelming fear the days and nights will drag on slowly in suffering
he is finished
what can i do
i am only a boy
you are the man who wrote this letter
you are the man who has come back to lead us
you will soon have great responsibilities
you must know what to do
the regent and the lord chamberlain are present
also present is the kashag a council of four men one monk three laymen
they are the dalai lamas advisory cabinet
the boy rises from his desk
norbu says you remember who you are
you called for them
tenzin gyatso enters the adjacent room
the boy climbs onto a cushion and sits a head above his officials
he is tentative unsure of form and procedure
there is an awkward formal silence
then taktra rinpoche i understand there was an attempt on your life
it is possible holiness
you are unharmed
where is reting rinpoche now
he has been imprisoned here in the potala holiness
the sera monks have surrendered
it is calm
the boy motions to the table
please have tea
the tea is poured
i need to know what you know
i am no longer a child
ask whatever you will
what is the danger from the chinese now
very complicated holiness
let me tell you current news
the chinese have launched a deceptive campaign aimed at convincing the world that tibet belongs to china
we sent a mission to the chinese national conference
our attendance was a grave mistake
the tibetans were introduced as delegates from the chinese region of tibet
we protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it
did you receive the letter
we did not
the war is over
this is a time in when nations are redefining themselves
so tibet too needs to define itself
as a free country
but our attempts have proven futile
we continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the chinese
can india help us
india is a newly independent nation
they are struggling
india is in no position to help us
britain chooses not to
america we shall see
ask the chinese mission to leave our country
a shocking suggestion
i shall send a letter to america to the president informing him of our problem
the men agree to this
i want reting rinpoche well cared for
he is my teacher
he found me
the dalai lama sits at his desk writing a letter
the radio is on
it is the bbc with news of a communist advantage in kuomintang china
norbu thundrup enters
the boy looks up
listen to this norbu
he reads to mr truman the president of the united states of america i am glad that you are enjoying the best of health and doing good service to uplift
the happiness and prosperity of the whole world
here i am well and doing my best for the religion of lord buddha and welfare of all beings
this is all so far
reting rinpoche has died in prison
tenzin gyatso lays down his pen
tenzin gyatso is alone
he has a little smelting arrangement built out on the terrace
he lays a lead soldier on the hot bottom of a heavy metal bowl
close on the soldier
it begins to melt
the boy has a pile of the soldiers
he drops a second one in the bowl
we bear the sounds of lhasa laughter street songs and we see the stars hanging it seems just above the young boys head
the young tenzin gyatso bursts through the gate in the yellow wall and runs across the beautiful garden to his parentss home
a family gathering meets the boys eye when he enters
there is his mother his oldest sister tsering dolma lobsang samten a younger sister pema baby brother tendzin chuta and his oldest brother takster
we dont recognize these faces of course but the gathering is obviously familial
only the boys father is missing
tenzin gyatso goes to his mother and lays his head in her lap
on an altar behind her is a silver frame
in the frame is a picture of her husband
the body of the dalai lamas father lays on a flat boulder
incense smoke curls into the air
prayer wheels are turned hand drums are played the burial men stand off to one side their hatchets and knives in view
tenzin gyatso is present
he is the boy we know but beside him stands the four year old boy lhamo from the beginning of the movie and on the other side of him stands
the boy who will play the dalai lama in the next section of the film a boy about fifteen or sixteen
tenzin gyatso wraps his brown rosary around his left wrist
the beads catch the brilliant afternoon light
the sixteen year old dalai lama wears the same colored rosary around his left wrist
the cutters move in to the corpse and as we hear them begin the work of dismembering the body the view pans up to reveal the vultures circling overhead
the last person leaving the hilltop with is the dalai lama as an older man not a character from this movie but a man of about fifty years wearing glasses
wearing the same robes the same rosary
little lhamo walks beside him
we hear a loud explosion and then another and another and another
the sound begins to fade but the blue black peaceful star filled sky is shattered by bright bursts of red and yellow and pink light
it is a frightening sight
the still waters of the fish pond begin to move
the fish swim in nervous circles the water laps over its stone banks
the whole building shakes
one monk runs down the stairs another monk runs up both staring at a second floor window a black rimmed glass window
a red cloth is pulled back and the window is opened
the fifteen year old tenzin gyatso looks out
there is a terrible rumbling the rumbling that accompanies an earthquake
finally slowly the sound and the movement subsides
close on tenzin gyatso
he lets the curtain fall
the general assembly is in session
once again the yigstang and the tsitang four monks and four laymen sit facing one another
but the room is crowded today this is a full session
the lord chamberlain sits in
regent taktra is there
the senior layman is on his knees
the communist have control of china
in the back of the room we notice an open door
the dalai lama is listening
he stands taller than the first time we caught him eavesdropping
he still is not a part of this assembly but he doesnt seem to care if he is spotted
the layman continues
now as his great army stands idle on our borders chairman mao has presented tibet with three demands one tibet must accept that it is part of china
a murmuring in the room
shock on the face of his holiness
two tibets defenses must be handled by china
three all political and trade matters concerning foreign countries must be conducted through china
a voice shouts out give the dalai lama his majority
the senior monk is on his knees
we can concede that tibet is a part of china if we can guarantee that the dalai lamas name and authority will remain
and do you believe that the tibetan government will be allowed to continue to function as it is
do you believe that our religion will be protected
give the dalai lama his majority
we have dealt with this chinese obsession for hundreds of years
we can deal with it now
these are not the chinese we know
these are communists
make him dalai lama now
we see the lord chamberlain look toward the open door
tenzin gyatso looks at his advisor and then he closes the door as the demand for his enthronement continues
he walks down the hall past the door leading to the treasure room alone now an adult
he is wearing those european lace up shoes found in the treasure room so long ago
they are still too big for him
tenzin gyatso and taktra rinpoche walk side by side along the waterway
if we agree that we are part of china nothing else will matter
not trade not defense
we will be lost
what would you do holiness
the boy looks out over the water
shepherds are leading their flock of sheep back toward town on the far side of the tributary
the two men stand side by side one so young one seeming so old
what should i do about my doubt teacher
it is a difficult situation
i mean my doubt
am i him
doubt is an affliction
i believe we must make no concesions to the chinese
but i am one voice
the dalai lama has always trusted in the forces of buddha
let us consult the protective deities
taktra rinpoche bows and leaves him
tenzin gyatso stands alone by the river
the boy watches the herders and before the young shepherds disappear from sight the dalai lama turns and waves a hand behind him
two bodyguards approach
we can not hear but as the dalai lama walks away from us down the river one bodyguard runs up river shouting bodyguard shouting we will buy them
we will buy them
in this black room under the protective view of the statue of mahakala a divine lottery is performed
tenzin gyatso the regent taktra rinpoche the lord chamberlain the kashag the yigstang and the tsitang are all present
tsampa dough balls are made three of them each containing a strip of parchment bearing writing
the dough is shaped and weighed to see that each ball is equal
then the three balls are placed in a silver bowl and the bowl is spun
the balls whirl race and finally one leaps from the bowl
this ball is taken to the dalai lama and he makes a mark on it
the ball is returned to the bowl the procedure is repeated and a ball leaps again almost immediately
this ball is presented and the dalai lama places his mark next to the mark he just made
it is the same ball
tenzin gyatso makes the twelfth mark on the same ball and the spinning begins again and then the thirteenth mark and then the ball is broken open and the strip
of parchment handed to the regent
we should not accept any conditions from the chinese
in a paved area adjacent to the yellow wall which marks the dalai lamas private grounds the opera festival has begun
this festival involves performances by tibetan singers dancers and actors
it looks to be a joyous occasion officials and their wives are dressed in their finest and sit before beautifully laid picnics
children run here and there amidst the monks and nomads the swashbuckling khambas from eastern tibet large people with heavy braids wrapped in red cloth on top of their heads
there are westerners nepalese and sikimese
dancers dressed in wild colorful outfits spin and leap in time to the eerie tibetan music
atop a low building on the yellow wall stands an elaborate enclosure draped in yellow silk
the dalai lama sits inside it
tenzin gyatso is alone in this little room his arms rest on a window ledge as he stares down at the festival taking place below him
a bit more of the dancers and the people enjoying themselves all from the isolated point of view of the dalai lama
we recognize a few characters keustang rinpoche
his holinesss mother with her younger children the favorite sweeper norbu thundrup dressed in a fine hat
but a distant figure becomes apparent he is a messenger he is running through the crowds toward the yellow wall
we stay on this desperate little figure as he draws closer
the boy is watching the messenger
back to that messenger as he works his way ever closer to the building which holds the dalai lama aloft and then we lose sight of him
tenzin gyatso leans back in his seat
the yellow silk curtain that his elbows have held open now fall closed and we hear the heavy footsteps of the runner
the regent is next door
the boy climbs up on a chest and peeks through a tiny window in the wall which separates this enclosure from the regents
taktra rinpoche reads a telegram
his aging face becomes quite grave
the regent leaves his side of the enclosure
summon the lord chamberlain and the kashag
and then there is a knock on the dalai lamas door
it is the regent
the chinese have invaded
back to a new group of performers satirists dressed as high lamas and monks even as the nechung oracle lampooning the rulers
the crowd roars with laughter
the lord chamberlain stands with the teenage dalai lama
the room is a violent red in the sunset
tenzin gyatso has cleared off his table he is creating a three dimensional battlefield as his lord chamberlain explains the situation
tenzin gyatso uses papers books little statues to bring a physical life to the words we hear
they crossed the river holiness
they have invaded in six locations chando province kham eastern tibet
what is the size of our army now
eight thousand five hundred soldiers and officers
we have recently requested mortars anti aircraft guns and ammunition from india
we have several hundred in the area
little statues are placed facing what stands in for the river
the lord chamberlain helps the boy to create this panorama
has anyone died
the radio contact said one officer had died
then he said the chinese soldiers they are coming
and then the radio went dead
tenzin gyatso lifts one statue a small golden buddha from the display
he cradles the buddha in his hands
a man has died
one man is too many
in beautiful sunlight the painted cabinets of this room glisten
rainbows of color play on the glass windows
the dalai lama sits at a low table a pack of colored pencils or pastels spread out around him
he is teaching his little brother to draw
together little hand in bigger hand they draw
the dalai lamas mother sits in a side chair watching her sons
the little boy screams with laughter as the brothers draw a yak
a movie is being shown outside on a makeshift screen
it is henry the fourth
this is a treat for the sweepers and gardeners and servants
children sit on the grass mesmerized by this incredible vision
tenzin gyatso sits beside heinrich harrer
the boy rubs his eyes wearily
he appears distracted
this line is spoken by an actor heavy lies the head that wears the crown
close on tenzin gyatso
the dalai lama sits behind the wheel of a austin
he is a lousy driver a boy who never commanded a wheeled vehicle in all of his young life
the attendants sit in the back seat holding on for dear life
we hear tenzin gyatsos wonderful deep laugh
tenzin gyatso is listening to peking radio
norbu thundrup is with him
the boy tinkers with a clock as he listens he is swiftly becoming a master tinkerer
this week the peoples liberation army crossed the drichu river east of chamdo and began the peaceful liberation of tibet
tibet is in the hands of imperialist enemies of the people
the dalai lama a foolish reminder of an illiterate past is the figure head of this autonomous region of china
accept our help tibet
the people shall be free
what do the people say norbu
norbu is not shy in his report
tibetan officials have retreated from chamdo
they are scared and running
the chinese strategy has destroyed the heart of our defense forces
chamdo falls several other villages are lost
you know what happens
the road to lhasa will be wide open
tenzin gyatso listens carefully to the man
the people want you made dalai lama
then i am lucky
i am still too young
these are dangerous times
they want the dalai lama to lead them
but i have no experience
oh but you do kundun
who else would be here
the nechung oracle spins in his trance
horns blow cymbals clash the oracle spurts sounds as lamas chant
finally the oracle approaches the boy stands beside him like a lieutenant a comrade and says his time has come
the dalai lama is reading tibets appeal to the united nations
to the members of the united nations the attention of the world is riveted on korea where aggression is being resisted by an international force
similar happenings in remote tibet are passing without notice
the problem is not of tibets own making but is largely the outcome of unthwarted chinese ambition to bring weaker nations on her periphery within her active domination
this is very good
the lord chamberlain and the four members of the kashag agree
the boy continues tibetans have for long lived a cloistered life in their mountain fastness remote and aloof
in the background we see monks on top of a wall long horns in front of them
the blowing begins
in a courtyard below a debating session is in progress
we hear the shouts and the claps and watch the beautiful body movements of the questioners
laughter fills the air
below that the small capital of tibet the mysterious city the forbidden city of lhasa carries on for now
a monk an abbot in fact sits beside tenzin gyatso
it is takster rinpoche the dalai lamas oldest brother
i was never alone
two chinese were with me every minute of the day
tenzin gyatso plays with a box of those special sweets which comes from his mother
their talk is always of liberation and helpfulness
they put their words like honey on a knife but if you lick the honey you will bleed
takster rinpoche begins to say something but holds back
they think they have convinced me
they think i am on their side
they have allowed me to leave kumbum and come to lhasa believing that i will try to turn you to their ways
if i do not succeed i am to eliminate you
you kill me
the tension is great the idea profound
i can be governor of lhasa they say
the brothers try to resist but cannot
they laugh like crazy
dont eat all those sweets
youll get sick
do you remember the day i came to your monastery when i was a baby
and you comforted me
i remember too actually
i was frightened then
i am frightened now
the chinese have one goal
the complete dissolution of our nation
the destruction of our culture
there is no room for buddha in their world
our only hope is to fight
this is not a fight to put bread just in ones own mouth
this is a fight for tibet
buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy
we have compassion for all people
these are not human beings
they are worse than ghosts
you are in great danger
the dalai lama cannot fall into chinese hands
you must flee
how could i ever leave
it may not be your decision to make
in the adjacent room the four members of the kashag and the lord chamberlain are waiting
the dalai lama enters the room
the boy goes to a small table where a document is unrolled before him
tenzin gyatso lifts the gold seal of power and affixes it to the document
i accept it
he makes his mark on a small piece of parchment that is attached to the document
he has accepted the request to be enthroned
the master of the robe is helping tenzin gyatso to dress
he ties a piece of green cloth around his waist and helps him on with his maroon robes
norbu is there watching
tenzin gyatso walks down this dark hall
the three attendants are with him
it is very dark green
butter lamps highlight certain faces members of the kashag noblemen the tutors an englishman nepalese bhutanese tibetan muslims but the darkness conceals the great number of people present
we hear the unmistakable tibetan horns and cymbals
we hear the chanting of monks
the boy is handed a golden wheel symbolizing the assumption of temporal power
at one moment the lamas all put on their yellow hats a color that peeks at us out of this dark room
and we hear a voice we shall send delegations to america india nepal and great britain in hope that these countries will intervene on our behalf
the dalai lama addresses the yistang the tsitang
two new faces are present
we have telegraphed our appeal to the united nations and await its reply
i am sending a delegation to china to negotiate the chinese withdrawal
he looks around these rooms
it seems that i must depart lhasa
the majority wills it
lukhangwa and lobsang tashi
the two men rise to their knees lukhangwa an incredible looking layman with a long white beard and lobsang tashi a monk
i am making you my prime ministers
you will stay here
you must always keep me informed no matter how bad the news
i want plain information
the men bow to his holiness
today i declare a general amnesty
i have always wanted to free the prisoners
tenzin gyatso is packing
we hear whispers in the adjacent room as the masters of the robe and the ritual organize belongings into piles rolled thangkas precious manuscripts maroon robes a few english books
the boy finds a few golden coins in a drawer and slips them into his robes
tenzin gyatso adds a package of tools an atlas the photo of the thirteenth dalai lama the european shoes
then he goes to the terrace
the boy does not need a footstool anymore
he glides the telescope across the countryside catching sight of the young herders leading their sheep back into town
he picks up a corner of the market place and the hub bub of the end of the day
wall posters show tibetan soldiers fleeing the red army
and then he aims his view finder at the prison yard
it is empty
the prisoners are gone
its time to take this down
tenzin gyatso lets go of the eyepiece and turns to see norbu
you will not come
am i running away
the people will cry when they learn you are gone
but they would all want you safe
together the friends break down the telescope
let me take this
norbu folds up the tripod
you must study very hard do not neglect the holy things during this time
i will miss you
we have had fun you and i
fun for a little boy in an old palace
you have grown up very good
and you have grown older and your chin has grown balder
the telescope is wrapped
tonight kundun you see the world
you place your feet on the shepherd boys path
norbu thundrup ties a tight knot in a cord
the gods will be avenged
close on the gold seal of state as it is packed in a silk lined box
tenzin gyatso dressed in the warm woolen chuba of a layman keeps his back against the wall
norbu is beside him carrying a flashlight
a bodyguard comes for them and then the dalai lama is outside the potala walls
the small group walks down a rocky path
a grey horse is waiting
tenzin gyatso is helped onto the horse
norbu sees that he is comfortable and then the flashlight goes out
norbu fiddles with it
tenzin gyatso takes the torch and tries get it working again
the guard mounts his horse
it is time to go
the horses snort their breath consolidating the cold night air
tenzin gyatso cannot speak
he tries but he cannot
norbu takes the flashlight
i will send it to you
it will work
the horse is turned and the dalai lama is led away to join the soldiers at the foot of the path
tenzin gyatso turns once to see his friend
the night is dark
norbu has become invisible
a cold and moonless night lit only by the millions of stars that shine over tibet
the caravan made up of noblemen monks family mambers and over two hundred soldiers armed with rifles machine guns and field artillery journeys out of lhasa
close on the dalai lama riding the shepherds path
tenzin gyatso rides his grey horse through a gate in the yellow wall
the boy climbs the stairs to his summer residence
the shrine of mahakala
butter lamps cast their eerie glow on the black walls as the boy presents a white silk scarf a kata a traditional token of leaving and return
tenzin gyatso is about to leave the residence when he stops and looks at the small cabinet in the corner
he goes to it
the door is still locked
close on the boy
suddenly he knows
he reaches a hand behind the cabinet
the hand comes back to him with a key
tenzin gyatso opens the cabinet doors
several drawers are revealed
the boy opens one
a bodyguard says from the stairs we must go holiness
and then success
in a small drawer there is something wrapped in red velvet
the boy opens it with shaking hands
tenzin gyatso releases a sharp laugh he has been holding his breath
he wraps up the teeth and puts them back but behind the teeth is something more
a rolled white silk scarf a kata
tenzin gyatso takes the scarf
he unrolls it
something falls on the floor
a tiny lead soldier
tenzin gyatso lifts the soldier
it is a ghurka
an indian soldier
please come holiness
i am ready
the boy places the scarf around his own shoulders
i am him
close on the golden statue of mahakala wearing his white scarf
we hear the roar of the kyichu river
coracles skin boats are loaded with bundles and people and pushed off the banks and into the water
horses donkeys and yaks must swim across
tenzin gyatso is helped into a boat
the rowers wrapped in heavy wool and sheepskin their arms bare push off
the boy is sprayed with water
he is bumped about
he is freezing cold
he floats away from lhasa
the caravan journeys through a narrow mountain pass
the flags of tibet and of the dalai lama are carried by mounted soldiers
suddenly monks come running from the surrounding mountain trails shrieking wailing
they run to lamas grabbing at their robes clutching crying out do not let him go
we beg of you do not take him from us
one monk clutches for an instant at the laymans wrapping on tenzin gyatso but he does not recognize him as the dalai lama the boy tenderly embraces this distraught figure
but the monk drops away from him and clings to the shy sweet presence of ling rinpoche
the dalai lama is quickly and quietly surrounded by soldiers discreetly so as not to give away his identity
ling rinpoche speaks to a group
he goes for a short time until the danger can be determined
he will not leave tibet
he will return
the pain on these monkss faces in their voices is tragic
tenzin gyatso is overwhelmed
he sees before him a line of prostrate monks but they are not bowing to him they are laying down in the pass trying to block the way of the
ling rinpoche goes to these men and gently helps them to their feet
he will return
the precious one will not abandon you
the dalai lama lies awake in his camp bed
he cannot sleep
he rises and walks to the tent flap
he opens it
a bodyguard is posted
he turns to the dalai lama
we recognize him
he is the bodyguard from that first caravan trip so long ago a huge monk with a big stick the guard who stood outside the old monkss tent
the man with the deformed face
the boy is not frightened this time
where are you from
your people are very brave
they are fighting the chinese
no one can stop them
not even me
khambas are wild men
there is silence as the two men look out at the cold night
i worry about them
do not worry holiness
they fight for you
they are under your protection
the boy steps back inside
we hear the approach of a horse and then the bodyguard enters the tent
holiness this has come for you
the bodyguard hands the boy a parcel
tenzin gyatso unwraps it
a pause and then tenzin gyatso sits in front of the thangka of penden lhamo
he reads from the scripture pages laid out on the low table
he reads by flashlight
the dalai lama walks along a beaten caravan path
he is still in disguise and obviously enjoying it
an old muslim man is beside him an incredible looking creature
and not a monk among them
the dalai lama laughs
no no son of mine will sit and read books and eat up the poor peoples butter while my people have to butcher the cows and sheep because these holy
men cant kill an animal
they can eat it cant they
the boy laughs again
still walking with two companions
a tibetan peasant woman and his own mother
did you love your husband before you married
i did not know him before i married him
i loved his brother but then i married his brother too
he is dead now
the land has stayed in the family
we work together
the nobleman is not too bad
does he treat you fairly
a laugh from her
not too bad
rich is rich poor is poor
we are different
are you married
tenzin gyatso laughs
the attendants walk behind the boy eavesdropping
tenzin gyatsos mother plays along
much too young
look for a strong woman not too occupied with her beauty
look for a woinan who keeps her hands busy
look for a kind heart
like my mother
i see that
the dalai lama walks beside two boys his older brother lobsang and a young noble boy
this little brother was terribly sweet
when he died my mother was so sad
a lama said to her before the little brother was laid out for burial take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin
he will come back to you you will see
so my mother did this and a few years later a new boy was born
does he have the spot
he does a little spot where the butter had been
is that a true story or pretend
what do you think
what does the butter spot feel like
i have a good friend back in lhasa
he has a very poor beard with a little spot on his chin where no hair grows
it feels like that
it is raining as we see the dalai lama on horseback climbing the dirt path leading to this beautiful small monastery
the caravan has arrived at its destination
we hear the chanting of monks
a home has been made books on the shelf screwdrivers all in a row european shoes under the bed
an old bush radio receiver running off a six volt battery sits on the floor
the telescope stands on the terrace
two members of the kashag can be seen in the adjacent room
the rooms are stark white
of the tibetan delegations sent abroad all have been turned away
tenzin gyatso dressed informally looking peaceful sits with his advisors on the floor
the lord chamberlain is with them
britain nepal america india
all of those governments have refused to meet with our representatives
and the united nations
the united nations voted not to hear our appeal
one country did sponsor the resolution
a land called el salvador
where is that
in the americas
so we must face china and all her might alone
most of the chamdo region is now in chinese hands
there is a report from chamdo which makes quite clear that unless some settlement can soon be reached communist troops will soon be marching on lhasa
with much bloodshed
i am afraid
i want at all costs to avoid this
do we have news from the delegation in china
not yet but the governor of chamdo ngabo jigme suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to peking
he is a capable man
your prime minsters would argue that such negotiations should take place in lhasa
and then they would concede that the times are desperate and we must go to peking
is that all
time to study
the boy gets up
the prostrations begin
tenzin gyatso waves a hand
the men get up awkwardly
we are in the last outposts of tibet
lets do away with some of this formality
the dalai lama leaves the room
one man still goes down to his knees
he is a modern man
just like he was the last time
ling rinpoche and tenzin gyatso sit together
i will liberate those not liberated
i will release those not released
i will relieve those not relieved
may i deliver them to the state of enlightenment
the lead soldier of the indian ghurka sits on the low table beside buddha and the tantric instruments
tenzin gyatso walks alone in the mountains
we see his bodyguards in the distance
he comes to a chorten a stupa a small pagoda like chapel
he steps inside
this is where the tibetan peasants come to make their offerings to buddha
it is a small space whitewashed quiet
a painting of buddha adorns one wall and flowers butter lamps nuts and dried fruit sit before it
the boy looks closer
there is a photograph pinned to the wall
it is a picture of him as a young boy
the precious one
the dalai lama ties his piece of colored cloth his mantra to this public prayer flag
the beautiful valley lies at his feet the bodyguards keep a polite distance
the boy is tinkering as he listens to the radio
it is peking radio he is picking up
we hear a crackly voice begin a very important announcement
today in peking a seventeen point agreement for the peaceful liberation of tibet has been signed by representatives of the government of the peoples republic of china and the local
government of tibet
tenzin gyatso drops his work
he turns to face the offending radio
over the last hundred years or more aggressive imperialist forces have penetrated into tibet and carried out all manner of deceptions and provocations
under such conditions the tibetan nationality was plunged into the depths of enslavement and suffering
the boy moves closer to the radio he appears physically ill
today this enslavement ends
point one the tibetan people shall unite and drive out imperialist aggressive forces from tibet
the tibetan people shall return to the big family of the motherland the peoples republic of china
point two the local government of tibet will actively assist the peoples liberation army to enter tibet and consolidate the national defense
tenzin gyatso is stunned
it means we have lost our status as an independent nation
tenzin gyatso the two members of the kashag and the lord chamberlain stand around a clicking telegraph machine
a long message curls along the floor
ngabo did not have the state seal
he could not sign
yes but they say he did
a kashag member is reading along as the message comes in
general chiang chin wu the chinese representative is en route to dromo
he is coming to meet you
then we shall meet
view through the telescope the chinese are coming
a group of officials are headed in the direction of the monastery
within the group of tibetan noblemen dressed in their traditional red and gold silk robes are three men wearing drab grey suits
the chinese men closer and we see that one of them is smoking a cigarette
close on tenzin gyatsos face
the chinese delegation led by general chiang chin wu stands waiting in a dimly lit yellow room
a table holds tea and refreshments
the dalai lama and his cabinet members are in the room
chairs are provided
we bring greetings from chairman mao
the general does
so does the dalai lama
the other two chinese remain standing
tenzin gyatso is quiet reserved
have you heard the terms of the seventeen point agreement
i have a copy for you
a document is produced
we notice that the general is wearing a gold rolex watch
the dalai lama notices too
a member of the kashag takes the document
we come in genuine friendship
close on the dalai lama
he makes no response
i am certain you wish to return to lhasa
tenzin gyatso remains silent
do you have plans to return soon dalai lama
our first request is that you allow us to build a road
you have no roads in tibet
we can discuss the plans in lhasa
when you return
we leave now
the general rises as the boy remains seated
with a moment of awkward silence the chinese depart
let me see the agreement
it is handed to him
he opens to the last page and looks at the impression made by the state seal
he closes the document and hands it back to the official
the boy watches the delegation leave the hilltop station
taktra rinpoche and the lord chamberlain are with him
i thought he would be some kind of monster even with horns growing out of his head
but he is only a man just an ordinary human being like myself
life is always a lesson
again an informal meeting is in session
your prime ministers support the proposal that you return to lhasa
on the opposite hand some officials urge you not to return
they believe you should leave now for india
if i were to go into exile could we expect any serious assistance from india suppose
it is unlikely
there is great anti communist feeling in america
at this point the most likely result of a foreign pact is war
the chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war
tibet at war
china is close america is far away
after countless people die china would still always be close
we will work with what we have
and as for your own safety holiness
i am scared
shall we consult the protective deities holiness
my first and foremost duty is to protect my people
i feel sure of this
and things change
maybe not right away maybe not soon
but i believe this things will change
the boy snaps his fingers
our own short lifetimes are not the only valid consideration
i shall return
tenzin gyatso is asleep
we have not seen him this still this peaceful in a long time
he sleeps in the buddha pose on his right side his head resting in his right hand
the wall behind him is white
we begin to hear the unique tibetan music
tenzin gyatso rides a grey mule across the empty mysterious landscape of tibet
the boy is back in his own home in amdo province
but he is not the baby he was when he left there he is sixteen
his family is together but they are all the sizes and ages they were at the beginning of the story
tenzin gyatso is very happy sitting on the raised platform in the kitchen playing a game with pebbles
taktra rinpoche the aged taktra enters and sits down beside him
i hope you will not feel badly about all the things of childhood you missed
the boy does not speak just looks kindly at the man
you lost so much
i am sorry
the boy shakes his head no
suddenly another man speaks goodbye kundun
tenzin gyatso turns his head to see his best friend
he only mouths it no
and now the dalai lamas father is seen in a corner of the kitchen
tenzin gyatso silent no
the boy turns to the sweeper once more holds out his hand and mouths no norbu
reverse on norbu fading away
tenzin gyatso eyes burst open
he is awake
he is older
but there is something ageless about him now
the boy begins this day
he is in his old room at the potala in lhasa
the green mural of the fifth dalai lama is behind him
he has risen
from the red curtained bed
the masters of the kitchen and the robe arrive and begin their preparations for the day
a new sweeper works in the adjacent room
the sun rises
like a painting the beautiful monastery fills the screen with its white walls and red roof
shouting is heard
i hate meeting here this tribute to the past
i demand a less formal meeting place
close on the red bulging face of general chiang
behind the general hang fantastic thangkas of the fifth dalai lama
i am not a foreigner
i refuse to be treated like one
the dalai lama is shaken by this violent behavior
he adjusts his new eye glasses
you see here thangkas of the fifth dalai lama the founder of our government
it is tradition at formal meetings for these thangkas to be hung
tibet is part of a modern nation
the general sits
i want the songs stopped
a slight smile
street songs about the general
reference to his gold watch
he is right they are quite insulting
i have no authority to ban singing in my country
you must also do something about the public meetings
i see this memorandum circulating with tibetan grievances
you have cracked a mans skull and that crack has not healed
it is too soon to expect him to be your friend
we are simply respecting the terms of the seventeen point agreement
are you general
we want more tons of barley distributed
you will bring famine down on the people of tibet with these insatiable demands
more food the best land for your soldiers to camp
the peoples liberation army pays for all food and lodging
so far they do
but the quantity it does not exist
you will have to re evaluate your needs
the men glare at one another
how much tea do you drink prime minister
it depends on the quality
and that it be indian
the general leaps to his feet and is about to strike the prime minister
the dalai lama runs between then
he holds the general back
why is it necessary for the chinese to keep so many soldiers in lhasa
to serve you
chairman mao wants you to feel that china belongs to you now
chairman mao can keep china
just give us back tibet
the general backs away and brings himself under control
plans for absorbing the tibetan army into the peoples army will soon be finalized
i will not approve it
then we will begin with replacing the tibetan flag with the flag of the motherland
and we will begin with tearing it down
tenzin gyatso stands between these furious men
he raises a hand silently requesting peace
we hear the sound of martial drums and trumpets and tubas
the dalai lama is at his telescope
three thousand pla soldiers march along the shepherdss trail
they march behind huge red banners of mao tse tung and chu te
this time the soldiers do look like monsters
their faces are grey coated with tibetan dust
their peaked hats look vaguely like horns their tattered khaki uniforms like rough hide
monks line the trail whipping at the soldiers with their long maroon robes
women and children spit at the chinese clap at them hoping to chase this evil away
the prime ministers lukhangwa and lobsang tashi submit their resignations to his holiness
the boy takes the roll of parchment from them
i am so sorry
it must be done
we can no longer meet with the chinese they refuse us
we hear the sounds of those chinese tubas and trumpets
we hear trucks
i accept your resignations
have you chosen your new prime ministers holiness
there will be no new prime ministers
you will face great difficulties holiness
the boy affixes his small piece of parchment to the document and makes a mark on it
they have taken away our silence
the dalai lama with much pomp and ceremony walks down a white carpet and steps into a coracle
the entourage includes the lord chamberlain the kashag his holinesss mother and youngest brother tutors and attendants
a hundred monks stand chanting on the far bank
the fourteenth dalai lama rides in a chinese jeep
dust surrounds him
a yellow silk umbrella shades him
we see that a road is under construction a road into lhasa
the first road in tibet
the dalai llama is travelling in the opposite direction
he is leaving his country traveling on rugged flattened earth
the way is tougher here the dalai lama is on mule back
this is a different land
there are rice paddies and water buffalo
the altitude and barrenness of tibet have been replaced by greener pastures jagged mountaintops and chinese natives
tenzin gyatso gets his ride in an airplane an antique
it is bumpy and noisy
he sits on an un upholstered steel frame
the dalai lama travels by train
the train pulls into the station
there are hundreds of people awaiting the arrival of the dalai lama hundreds of china pictorial red cheeked chinese communists men women and children waving little red flags
tenzin gyatso steps off the train and there is a roar of approval
song breaks out the peoples republic national anthem
the young man is overwhelmed
we begin to sense that something is wrong something is artificial
the peoples presence is demanded here today
this is a forced display of regard
the dalai lama and his retinue sit in this great hall decorated with a portrait of chairman mao
the great helmsman himself is speaking
mao tse tungs presence is charismatic
his delivery is powerful simple yet firm
he is spellbinding
the mission of china is to bring progress to tibet
develop its natural resources
help its people develop democracy
we welcome you tibet back to the motherland
tenzin gyatso snoops around this room
he opens drawers cabinets just as a child would
he finds odd little pieces of ceramics pens paper
he moves to the bathroom runs a bath
this is the modern world
the dalai lama sits beside chairman mao as a horde of photographers flash bulbs in their faces
mao offers his holiness a plate of chinese delicacies
we notice that maos clothes are shabby and old
his suit is always a shade lighter than everyone elses grey drab
his cuffs are frayed his collar is worn
but his shoes are beautifully polished
he has exquisite delicate hands and his skin is shinny
later chairman mao and the dalai lama sit across from one another
tenzin gyatso takes notes as mao speaks
i am so glad that tibet has come back to the motherland
tenzin gyatso quietly sips his tea
you must inform me at once if any of our people abuse the tibetans trust and good nature
i have great hopes for the future of our co operation
it is too early to implement all the clauses of the seventeen point agreement
we will establish a preparatory committee for the autonomous region of tibet
the pace of reform must meet with the desires of the tibetan people
changes must be made slowly as you yourself judge necessary
mao speaks and moves very slowly
he pants and wheezes
he appears to be sick
tenzin gyatso takes notes
i am happy to hear you say this chairman mao
i have created a reform committee to investigate grievances and we have abolished inherited tax and forgiven all money owed the government by people who are unable to pay
tibet is a great country
a a wonderful history
long ago you even conquered part of china
but now you have fallen behind and we want to help you
in twenty years time you could be ahead of us
then it will be your turn to help china
tenzin gyatso writes in his notebook
you know i have great respect for your lord buddha
he was anti caste
for some politics and religion can mix
for me i think such a mix is crucial
have a sweet
made in my home province
the kind my mother used to make
the dalai lama accepts
tenzin gyatso does physical exercise with a few chinese bodyguards
tenzin gyatso studies with ling rinpoche
the lord chamberlain sits with them
if moral discipline is learned from the beginning one possesses the root for achieving higher rebirth
a staircase for achieving liberation
an antidote eliminating misery and sorrow
without discipline there is no method
i am thinking of becoming a communist party member
i like what i see of marxism
it is based on equality and justice for all
i believe chairman mao wishes the best for our people
our path must be non violence
the lord chamberlain simply looks at the young man
he has nothing to say
there is a knock and tenzin gyatso is led into the room
mao is at his desk working late smoking heavily
ah dalai lama thank you for coming so late
i leave tomorrow
yes i am aware
how has your time in china been
tenzin gyatso sits
he takes out his book and pen ready to take notes
i have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments
your people are capable and courteous
you have a lot to learn about organization
how to draw out peoples opinions
how to make key decisions
train your young tibetans
when i make contact with you i want to reach you through a tibetan
tenzin gyatso records maos words
your attitude is good you know
i understand you well
but you need to learn this religion is poison
it undermines the race and it retards the progress of the people
tibet has been poisoned by religion
the boy cannot look up
he is in shock
we see the last words he writes religion is poison
well let me walk you to your car
tenzin gyatso slowly gets to his feet
we must see on his face that he realizes it has all been lies
all the kind words and promises it must all be lies
he is unable to raise his face to maos
all he sees before him are those shinny shoes those exquisitely shaped glistening hands
outside this building a black car is waiting
it is bitterly cold
mao wearing no hat no coat and coughing opens the door for the boy
the dalai lama shakes the mans hand
take care of your health
tenzin gyatso gets into the car and mao slams the door
as the car drives away tenzin gyatso turns to see the chairman still standing in the cold still waving goodbye
then tenzin gyatso looks straight ahead and says he will betray us
the view pulls back
the lord chamberlain sits beside the young man
did you ever doubt it
i had relinquished doubt
the dalai lama and members of his retinue stand in front of his old house in the village of taktser amdo province
the young man smiles as he enters the courtyard
he pauses to look at the prayer flag flapping in the breeze
he opens the front door
a family of relatives inhabits the house
they bow to his holiness as the young man makes his way to the kitchen
tenzin gyatso steps into the kitchen he might have to bend his head under the low ceiling
he laughs his wonderful laugh
immediately a woman approaches with a cup of tea
but the hand of a chinese official reaches out takes the tea and returns it to her
it is not permitted
the woman looks confused
tenzin gyatso is humiliated
a group has gathered outside the house
tenzin gyatso goes toward them as they prostrate
when they have finished he reaches out his hands to take theirs
he says to one old woman are you happy
the old woman says with tears in her eyes i am very happy and prosperous under the guidance of the chinese communist party and chairman mao tse tung
it is a horrifying announcement
the dalai lama touches her head
she weeps and clutches his hands
the young man looks up over her head to kyeri the protectress mountain of this small village
we hear loudspeakers blaring in the background trumpeting propaganda about chairman mao and the peoples liberation army
tibetan horns blow
it sounds like a warning
close on a newspaper
it is a chinese newspaper and the picture on the front page shows a row of severed tibetan heads
tenzin gyatso puts the paper down
he removes his glasses and turns to his advisor the grand lord chamberlain
i ask them to stop to lay down their guns
the khambas gun is his most prized possession
i admire them so
they face a modern well equipped army and still they fight
the dalai lama rubs his face with his hands
land reform is underway in amdo
the large estates are being confiscated and redistributed
landlords are being punished
a beggar can be called a landlord if he disapproves of the chinese
the men are silent
we hear the constant sound of trucks and cars
the lord chamberlain is notably pausing
i have always asked for plain information
just the truth
the communists put their guns in the hands of the khamba children and force the child to kill the parent
they have dropped bombs on the monastery of lithang in kham
it has been destroyed
women and children trying to escape from the fighting have been shot with machine guns fired from airplanes
the pursuit of non violence
non violence means co operation when it is possible
resistance when it is not
his holiness walks to the terrace
he aims the telescope
below him he sees a new lhasa a lhasa full of trucks and chinese soldiers
a traffic island stands in the center of an intersection
the town walls are white washed
the political posters are gone
a small group sits waiting on red velvet chairs the dalai lama the lord chamberlain and the kashag
general chiang enters the room
he finds a chair and pours himself a cup of tea
we cannot help but notice he is armed
we have decided that no drastic changes will take place in tibet for six years
this should make you happy
it seems a revolt has broken out in the east
we have decided that the tibetan army must be used against the khamba guerrillas
the general sips
the dalai lama answers
i will not approve it
the general looks up surprised
it took a great deal of courage for the young man to answer back so determinedly
you have bombed on peaceful people
we must deal with these reactionaries
we are peace loving people
i am afraid we cannot trust you
the general sputters we are here to heal the people of tibet
you need reform
you have no sense of what is good for your people
we are here to liberate you
now the boy finds his voice
i burn here but i am not suppose to let the smoke show
yes we need reform
but we want change for tibet as tibet needs it not for china
the general starts to speak but tenzin gyatso keeps talking
buddha is our physician general he will heal us
comapssion and enlightnement will set us free
you can not liberate me i can only liberate myself
the general leaves the room
they will take lhasa next
the people will not allow it
the nechung oracle is in full swing
it is an especially vivid and violent spin he is in
the headdress whips this way and that and finally he says where there is no crossing a big river no fords no shallows where the only hope is a boat
and there is no boat
i will put a boat kundun
the wish fulfilling jewel will shine from the west
it is a strange and confusing prophecy
a few random views of the norbulinka the wandering deer and peacocks
the fish pond and its inhabitants
over these pictures we hear words i rejoice in the awakening of the buddhas and also in the spiritual levels of their sons
the projection room
the full sheep pen
the parentss home
and with gladness i rejoice in the ocean of virtue from developing an awakening mind that wishes all beings to be happy
the yellow wall
the dalai lamas red room
as well as in the deeds that bring them benefit
and now we hear the voices of a great many people reciting with folded hands i beseech the buddhas of all directions
to shine the lamp of dharma for all bewildered in the gloom of misery
in the midst of war there is beauty
the dalai lama performs the kalachakra ceremony
it is a beautiful ornate colorful ceremony
a prayer for world peace
tenzin gyatso sits on a platform of cushions above the heads of the abbots and lamas and tutors above the heads of the tibetan noblemen and nomads and khambas and
pesants from all corners of the land who attend the ceremony
with folded hands i beseech the conquerors who wish to pass away to please remain for countless aeons and not to leave the world in darkness
the dalai lama proceeds with the ceremony
he handles and blesses sacred objects he lifts his bell and dorge
rice is passed among the people
rice is thrown
a tibetan chant is sung
beside his holiness is a large yellow silk pagoda
the view moves inside the pagoda as the chanting continues
we see a mandala a beautiful intricate sand painting
the home of kalachakra
thus by the virtue collected through all that i have done may the pain of every living creature be completely cleared away
the whole screen becomes this mandala as the chanting an cymbals and deep resonating sounds of the song continue and then a hand comes into the mandala and begins to
sweep it up
pull back to see that the hand belongs to tenzin gyatso
tenzin gyatso collects the ground particles of tibetan quartz and rock
he destroys the painstakingly lovely sand painting
the chanting becomes louder and louder and it mixes with the sound of the river
tenzin gyatso pours the sand into the river
we watch the river take color and the mandala floats away
this view is overlapped by one of extreme horror
the lovely norbulinka garden the park where opera pageants and kalachakra ceremonies take place is now a killing field
hundreds of dead slaughtered monks lie on the blood drenched ground under the peach and pear trees
chinese soldiers move amongst the monks turning over the dead bodies searching those silent faces
the solder we see is carrying a photo of his holiness
they are searching for the dalai lama
it is a nightmare
we hear crying
tenzin gyatso wakes up
shaking crying he is alone in the dark
he can barely catch his breath
the screen goes black
close on an invitation his holiness the dalai lama of tibet is invited to attend a dance recital at the newly erected great hall of the liberation army
a last view of the great monastery
we hear the sound of thousands of tibetan women shouting chinese go
tenzin gyatso steps outside
the shouting grows louder chinese go
the young man looks around at the peaceful premises
people we know uembers of the kashag attendants tutors the dalai lamas mother sweepers appear in the garden one by one all listening to the sounds of a uob gathering
outside the walls of the norbulinka
a meeting is in progress
the crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the chinese festivities
many who have been invited to dine with the chinese do not return home
i will not go
i will alert the chinese delegation
you know i would never have let you go alone kundun
the dalai lama enters his mothers home
it is very guiet here
the young man looks at the family photographs on the blue walls the needlework on the table the seven copper bowls in front of the statue of buddha
did you come to tell me we are leaving lhasa
the boy fills the seven bowls with water
his mother lights the butter lamps
do you think i must
he says softly tibet has never been part of china
we are different races
we are different cultures
we need change we know that
but we could do it alone
we were just about to do it alone
the young man fills the last bowl with water
i am afraid i will go
far far away
the lord chamberlain approaches the dalai lama as he leaves his mothers house
we are now accused of aiding the rebels
the chinese said we can expect drastic measures to be taken to crush this revolt
arrange for me to speak to the peoples leaders
the lord chamberlain hurries away
a last meeting in session
the kashag is present as are fifty leaders of the opposition rough tired men
i fear that there will be great bloodshed if you cannot convince the people to disperse and go home
i am safe
holiness the chinese tried to entice you to their garrison with out protection of bodyguard
even now they urge you to come to them for safety
they are bringing more troops and guns and artillery into lhasa
there are three airplanes waiting outside lhasa
what do they wait for
they are planning to kill the dalai lama
dont you see
the dalai lama consults the nechung oracle
the oracle whispers stay
it is late at night
the boy is alone
he sits in front of his altar meditating
the nechung oracle is brought in
the monk quiets himself and readies himself for the trance
the dalai lama waits
slowly the trance comes on the heavy headdress is placed on the monks head the attendants leave the room and then the oracle speaks
i tell you to stay
the lord chamberlain hurries up the stairs
tenzin gyatso steps forward out of the shadows
the chinese are planning to attack the crowd and shell the norbulinka
you are asked to indicate on a map where you will be so that the artillery men will not mistakenly aim at you
the dalai lama walks down the outdoor stairs
tell them i will be here
with my people
the young man is studying with ling rinpoche
books of scripture are stacked in front of him
suddenly there is a tremendous loud explosion and then another
tenzin gyatso gets up and runs to the window he looked out of the day of the earthquake
there is shouting and chaos
the chinese have begun shelling the norbulinka
the north wall and the grounds directly in front of it are on fire
this time the oracle is in the room first
he is surrounded by his attendants and the members of the kashag the lord chamberlain ling rinpoche and various tutors and lamas
the tension is thick
finally the dalai lama enters
tenzin gyatso sits
the trance begins the headdress is set upon the mediums head and the oracle begins to dance and then he begins to shout go
the oracle staggers forward snatches up some paper and a pen and begins to draw a map a route out of lhasa
he keeps repeating go
close on the map drawn with a shaking sweating hand
we see mountains and a pass and the names of towns along the way
tenzin gyatso rises and goes to the oracle
he looks down at the map
the oracle hands the dalai lama the map and faints as his frightened attendants rush to loosen the strap of the headdress before the poor man chokes
the boy sits at the table writing
we can hear the crowd shouting outside the norbulinka walls
we see just a few words of the letter please do not resist
take refuge on the far side of the river
attendants pack quietly and quickly
the chapel of mahakala
we are reminded of secret sacred moments from long ago
tenzin gyatso opens the heavy creaking door
the dalai lama is in disguise
he is wearing the clothes of a khamba guerrilla dark woolen chuba and tall black boots
monks sit on the floor chanting
one monk stands by a large urn ladling out butter for the lamps
tenzin gyatso goes to the front of the room
a monk begins to play the cymbals
another puts the tibetan horn to his lips and blows a long mournful note
the dalai lama lays a white silk scarf a kata over the shoulders of this imposing statue
then he sits for a moment
in the weak light in the black room tenzin gyatso is lost among the other praying monks
the dalai lama walks down the hall
he says to a sweeper dim the lights
and then he bow bends down to pat a dog
tenzin gyatso rolls the thangka of penden lhamo and slides it into its ancient container
the young man places the scroll over one shoulder
close on the little cabinet in the corner of the entrance hall
tenzin gyatsos hands open the doors
the young man pulls open the drawer which contains the false teeth
tenzin gyatso pulls a rolled kata from his coat
he tucks the lead soldier of an indian ghurka into the center of the scarf
he places the bundle in the drawer
then he adds something
the kind his mother makes
he closes the drawer and locks it
he hides the key again behind the small unobtrusive cabinet
with a soldier on either side of him the dalai lama descends the staircase
the soldiers start to lead him away but he pauses
the young man leaves them
he walks to the far side of this white building
i see a safe journey
the boy returns to the front steps
i see a safe return
the soldiers wait
i am ready
tenzin gyatso places the scroll over one shoulder
a soldier lays a rifle over the other one
the three men walk quietly through the empty gardens
we hear the sounds of the crowd grow louder
the soldiers pause look to his holiness
tenzin gyatso removes his glasses puts them in his bag then nods and the soldiers open the gate
move aside tour of inspection move aside
of course we see only a fraction of the crowd angry men and women
a man steps beside his holiness
tenzin gyatso looks up face to face
it is the khamba bodyguard the monk who guarded him so many times
the man with the horrible face
move aside let us through
the dalai lama is between the soldiers shouldering his own gun
the bodyguard falls in behind
the little group makes its way through the crowd
tributary of the kyichu river night in the same place where the little tenzin gyatso tentatively tested one rock the escape party crosses on the slippery stepping stones
the small party makes its way across a bit of countryside
people are camped here khambas farmers nomads
the dalai lama crosses to safety unnoticed
the dalai lama climbs in the lord chmaberlian sits beside him
the soldiers push off
the khamba bodyguard stands on the bank alone
every splash of the oars sounds like it could wake the dead
tenzin gyatso looks back
he puts on his glasses
he sees camp fires and the glow of torches
he hears echoed voices
he looks up
he sees the stars and the moon and that incomparable tibetan sky
he looks forward
he sees mountains
i have always loved mountains
he is handed a steaming cup of tea
and then a cloud passes over the moon
on horse back the party makes its way up a mountain pass
there are more members now tenzin gyatso has joined those who left ahead of him members of the kashag tutors his mother his brother
it is tough going
the ground seems like quick sand with every step a struggle
when the horses have disappeared from sight a sand storm arises wiping away their tracks
the party passes above an encampment of chinese soldiers
they are not seen
the party travels through the emptiness
his holiness walks beside his horse
he joins other members of the group standing on a ridge
tenzin gyatso picks up a rock and throws it over the side
right will be victorious
and now the others do the same
the lord chamberlain says the gods will be avenged
the dalai lama sits before a low table set up on this desolate border
a document is before him
i repudiate the seventeen point agreement with a slap of the state seal of tibet this is done
the lord chamberlain removes this document and replaces it with another
i constitute the government of tibet the only legal authority in the land
the seal comes down hard once more
it is done
a sick and tired tenzin gyatso makes the last leg of his trip on the back of a black yak
before him through the light rain we see a small bamboo arch erected in the middle of nowhere
six indian ghurkas wearing floppy jungle hats and heavy british boots stand at attention
the dalai lama on his black yak passes under this babboo gateway as the indian soldiers raise their guns in salute
an indian soldier goes to the yak and helps the sick man from his mount
tenzin gyatso stands barely able to hold himself on his feet
his hand rests on the yaks back
the indian soldier steps closer and knowing he is breaking protocol he whispers with all respect may i ask
who are you
the young man smiles at the soldier a man who looks like the lead soldier come alive
what you see before you is a man
a simple monk
are you the lord buddha
i think i am a reflection like the moon on water
when you see me and i try to be a good man see yourself tenzin gyatso unpacks
he is dressed in maroon robes his arms bare
he places some books on a table next to his tinkering equipment
he lifts a heavy parcel
close on the young mans beautiful hands as he sets up his telescope
the tripod is erect
the body is attached
the eyepiece is adjusted
and then this boy this man this simple monk aims to takes a look at a bigger world
on a black screen a card reads the dalai lama has not yet returned to tibet
he hopes one day to make the journey
