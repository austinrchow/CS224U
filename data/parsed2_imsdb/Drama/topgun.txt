note aerial dialogue in caps is uhf radio plane to plane plane to carrier
aerial dialogue in small case is ics an inter cockpit system a live mike heard by pilot and rio only
rain drives horizontal
the sea surges up nearly to the flight deck of the aircraft carrier uss kitty hawk
the carrier plunges driving its bow into a wall of grey water
the deck pitches forward and back rolls left to right and yaws in a corkscrew motion
the entire ton behemoth rises and falls in the typhoon driven swell
silver wings flash by a cockpit fiery jet exhausts
a forty ton monster drops at knots into an area the size of a tennis court in a controlled crash
a shower of sparks a screech of rubber and metal as the gear hits the deck
the hook catches the wire and the f tomcat is slammed to a halt
its the scariest thing youve ever seen the most dangerous maneuver in aviation and just another day at the office for a naval aviator
leans almost horizontal into the winds
he holds the pickle controlling the landing lights and speaks into a mike
his calm professional commands belie the extreme conditions
it slams in
the pilot hits full power catches the wire slams to a stop cuts his engines
lots of scopes and electronic gear
the carrier control approach officer cca watches a blip on radar reaches for his mike key
we float like gods above the storm above the cloud cover looking down
from overhead a probe slides into frame then a graceful nose
the cockpit sides by pilot then radar intercept officer rio barely illuminated by the orange glow of their instruments
the fuselage gracefully swells to two enormous air intakes then variable angle wings swept back for high speed flight
twin tailbooms cant outward horizontal stabilizers make constant adjustments
enormous twin jet exhaust ports glow red in the moonlight
we become aware of wind whistle jet engine sounds radio static
the pilot cougar is calm steady
the radar intercept officer in the backseat goose is a wildman always an edge of humor in his voice
a uhf transmission breaks in
filtered almost immediately the rio picks up a target and responds
come in on the cockpit with stenciled name and call signs lt
evan mitchell is the pilot maverick
in flight suit and oxygen mask we can only see his eyes
they are confident
in his mid twenties he is lean hard athletic
the archetype fighter pilot
his rear seater is ltjg

maverick peels off to right to high cover position oclock
heads up display hud glows dimly on the windscreen
directly in front of the stick two crt screens display data
the bottom screen shows a radar sweep
wedged between the instruments is a snapshot of a pretty young woman with a month old baby
mustang this is look for the trailer
i dont see anything
maverick flying in combat spread mile abeam higher
closing at knots the mig is a speck then a flash and a roar a knife edge pass at feet
it rockets past his left wing tip and disappears
cougar kicks rudder whips the stick screams into a tight turning roll and dives after him
he slams the throttle forward to zone afterburner
maverick sees a second mig drop from above onto cougars tail
maverick swings after him lights it
they punch through cloud cover into the soup
he is closing on the first mig when a shocking blipblipblipblip tone breaks into their headsets
ive got a six strobe
i think hes locked on us
its a mig
they dont have radar missiles
lets hope youre right
what is he doing
hes pissing me off
cougar swings mad gyrations cutting back and forth across the front migs tailpipe trying to break the lock on
the tone grows more insistant
cant shake him
straight for mustang
stay with him
the tone grows steady blipblipblipblip
alarmed thats missile lock
he better be kidding
eyeball to asshole
hope nobody burps
ill lock on them cougar
to himself gotcha covered dont nobody move
to himself and his rio okay boys pull out with your hands up and nobodyll get hurt
up front cougar checks his gunsight
he gets i
were locked on mig one
why doesnt he disengage
these guys are getting on my nerves
but cougar presses forward and mig two stays on his tail
anger gives way to discipline
cougars tomcat breaks left dives into dense cloud
mig two still follows
still hears the tone blipblipblip
he rolls over into wild evasive maneuvers finally breaks lock
breaks out of cloud looks around startled
there is nothing no f
he scans the sky frantically while rolling the aircraft
suddenly he feels a presence
he looks straight up and behind him
a few feet away a tomcat slides into position canopy to canopy an incredible feat of flying
maverick and wizard stare at him
maverick slides even closer canopies nearly touching
the mig pilot acknowledges them with a weak wave
maverick stares for a moment then flips him the bird
the mig pushes negative g hard down and away
he heads for the deck
hes running for it
ah the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat
speaking of feet fuels down to
were gonna get them wet unless we find a sonoco station

how the hell we supposed to land on something we cant even see
hey if it was easy everybody would want to come up here and do it
instead of just us

filtered call the ball
i dont see the ship
blasts slam the airframe
rain tattoos the canopy
a gust rolls the tomcat he straightens it a gust flips it again
the carrier lights appear and disappear through the storm
to himself a walk in the park mustang

goose is thrown about as the wing dips straightens dips
help me with this one im really screwed up
bring it left
bring it left youre high
this is crazy
what is it

cant you feel it
im hanging in my straps
look at the instruments were okay
they must be broken
im hanging in my straps
he hears cougars chatter over the air
filtered goose v
filtered mavericks plane settles in over the ramp suddenly blasts from its afterburners
it roars over the deck without touching and off into the night
the lso is shocked into comment
what the hell you doing
helping him in
what makes you think we can get back in
we dont have the fuel for this
just get me to him
hes nine oclock high
were two thousand pounds low
mavericks plane pulls up behind cougars
cougars plane suddenly flips over flying inverted
im pulling up
now were inverted
maverick pulls up off the wing of the inverted aircraft
his voice is calmness itself
cougar looks over surprised
cougars plane completes the roll is now upright
were on vapor cougar you got to put it down
its crazy man
instruments are crazy
were gonna have to eject
maverick pulls up wing tip to wing tip inches apart
look at the weather
theyll never find us
were near out of fuel
put it down
youll have mine cougar
itll be where your head used to be
all eyes are on what they can see of the approach of the two planes
maverick drops him off at the pattern and circles
the lso watches the approach
the tomcat drops a wing straightens drops the wing straightens
the approach of a pilot experiencing vertigo as cougar tries to satisfy his inner ear
a wind shear just off the ramp drives the plane suddenly down
afterburners blast but the tomcat horrifyingly settles tail low toward the deck
the deck crew watches in terror as the plane wallows in toward them
the lsos turn take a few steps and throw themselves off the flight deck
they sail into the night toward the surging seas a hundred feet below then are caught in safety nets hung off the side
settles settles standing on its engines trying to arrest its downward momentum
the hook raises sparks as it skids across the deck
the plane stops falling and hangs for a moment about to blast back up when the hook catches the last wire
the wire snags it plucking pounds of fuel metal and men out of the air and slamming it all to the deck
right wheel flies up the deck and over the side
the gear collapses
the plane screeches sideways
the crew watches helplessly as it skids slams into it and comes to rest in cloud of fuel vapor and steam
the lso runs up shouting into the mike
crash crew leaps into action
the fire crew is there
the man in the silver suit jumps up on the wing and crawls to the cockpit
the figures inside are not moving
he hits the canopy release
the canopy pops open
silver suit grabs at the rear seat harness release
he screams through his suits aluminized cloth
goose can you hear me
nothing for a moment
then the rios helmet moves
his head turns
he tears the mask away from his face looks up at silver suit
his head clears
silver suit is stunned for a moment
he straightens up his head inclines quizzically
then it hits him
son of a bitch
you will put it up front with the porsches
he grabs him under the armpits drags him out of the plane
take it easy
im a veteran
goose grabs a passing crewman by the arm
can you check under the hood
i thought i heard a funny noise
other crewmembers help cougar out
he seems stunned but goose reacts to his fear with frantic one liners
he grabs a crew members radio as silver suit helps him away and looks to the figures of the admiral and the air boss far up on the bridge
he waves to them does his best impression
a moment of disbelief
then hysterical tension relieving laughter
goose spots cougar being helped out
he pulls away reaches back into the cockpit and grabs cougars snapshot of wife and kid
they lead goose away as firemen blast the aircraft with foam
is it extra for the hot wax
clear the flight deck
a tillie a four wheel mobile crane slams up to the plane and slings its lifting harness
goose turns to silver suit
there goes your tip
they have monitored the chatter
bring it left
is the lso v
filtered softly wizard does a quick sign of the cross reaches down grabs his balls
the tomcat slams onto the deck clearing the wreckage by inches
watch as they bring a shaken cougar past
goose eyes wild waves at maverick and wizard rolling up
they flame out vvooommmmm
they sit there immobile waiting for a tow looking numb
goose does his stewardess
on behalf of your captain and your crew i want to thank you for flying vf
and next time your plans include the middle of the goddamn ocean in the dead of frigging night i hope youll think of naval aviation
the surgeon looks into gooses eyes
check his head
wobbling off never mind my head check my shorts
cougar lies alone in the dimness staring at the overhead
the usual clangs whistles engines of navy life sound forlorn echoing through the dim deserted passage
from the distance a single figure passes in and out of the glow of the overhead lights
cougar comes closer hobbling unsteadily
he reaches a door pulls himself erect and knocks on the sign commander tom otawoczek the skipper works at his desk responds without looking up
he looks up
cougar stands in the doorway a strange dazed look on his face
cougar what is it
you should be in sick bay
what are you doing
he walks over to the skippers desk
his eyes are glazed but his jaw is firm
thinking of my wife and kid
a determined movement
hand to chest
something metal hits it skids across the polished surface and clangs up against the coffee mug gold wings
cougar comes out of stingers room bumps into goose and maverick
he turns the other way
he stops turns to them
there is nothing to say
goose hands him his snapshot
cougar looks at his wife and kid for a moment then looks up at them
he turns away
come in here
maverick appears followed by goose
they stand at attention
the skipper says nothing
maverick sees the wings on the desk
he enters walks over stares down at them
he picks them up
ill talk to him
hes a good pilot
i talked a man back once
three months later we lost him
its his decision
only he knows
hes the best you have
hes going top gun
turns to maverick
now you are
maverick stares at the wings lost in conflicting emotions
well hes going indicating goose and he needs someone to fly the plane
skipper you cant do this
i didnt do it he did it himself
something about a wife and kid
the fact is hes lost it
he knows it
i know it
you were up there you know it too
give him a break skipper
it was raining snakes up there
hell be alright soon as all the gorillas go home
the skipper stares at goose non plussed for a moment
i know some rios are a little wiggy
but you abuse the priviledge
i dont believe im going to have to put the two of you in the same cockpit
but there it is
it may be good for the navy
it might be good for you but most of all its good for me
itll get you out of my sight
but skipper cougars been picked for top gun
hes the best of the best
well youll just have to make do with him indicates maverick
goose and maverick exchange looks
mavs a great flyer but
hes a hell of a flyer
in fact hes so damn good he might have been picked for top gun himself
except for one thing
screams he just cant seem to follow orders
stinger moves slightly to stand now directly in front of maverick and speak eye to eye at four inches
you just did an incredibly brave thing
what you should have done was land your plane
you dont own that plane the taxpayers do
i should ream you out for it
but it just doesnt work with you
youre a hell of a flyer
you are maybe too good
you never really stepped in it yet
so this is your chance
im gonna send you up against the best
they are better than you
maybe theyll knock that shine off your eagle and youll see finally where discipline and teamwork fit it
maverick hasnt really heard anything but topgun
he snaps out of it
that is all
tell me about the mig some other time
he snaps off a salute and does an about face
he turns back
he looks down at the wings in his hands slowing walks over places them gently on the skippers desk
his facade cracks just slightly
maverick and goose push through a gauntlet of aircrews
they have become notorious
guys grab at them
what happened up there
how close did they get
what did the migs do
one word is heard over and over
goose is left behind in the crowd
maverick pushes through
he walks fast
up ladders around turns down ladders through passageways
he breaks into a trot then a canter squeezing past enlisted men parts lockers then he breaks into a run
a hatch slams open on the side of the carrier
hes out on a catwalk instantly soaked running on rain slicked stairs cantilevered high over the breaking seas
he plunges forward to the bow of the ship stands on the very peak
he is yelling something
he stands there as the bow plunges terrifyingly into the trough
the water rises like a green mountain up up to break just a few feet below him showering him with spray
the noise is incredible
come around on his face
it is maddened
he raises his fist and punches the night
the foaming slope of the wave rushes up changing color as it desert sand whipping by
a big bike a real big bike a turbo
rockets across the desert
aviator shades low above the handlebars maverick
goose hangs on in back
it cranks faster pulls closer
it cranks up a notch its going to explode
it cant go faster but it does
it screams higher
it roars under by and away leaving dust
just the hiss and pop of metal cooling
maverick sits on it staring out past us
goose looks over mavericks shoulder
we see why
feet come into the frame
then the uniform california highway patrol
angle on maverick
chp enters the frame the usual hypercivil arrogance tinged with awed disbelief
the usual questions are spaced for effect as if he might be talking to some other form of life
maverick is off the bike standing at attention
goose follows more slowly
do you know why i stopped you
maverick has some good idea how to deal with authority
i do sir the chp adjusts his own aviator shades
what is it
more than sincere sir
you are going to give me a warning sir
chp a touch of a smile quickly surpressed
license and registration
maverick hands them over with his navy id
chp scans them hesitates a moment over the last looks up with a touch more respect
lieutenant do you know how fast you were going
i do sir
i was going mach point one five
chp nods sagely
one sixth the speed of sound
a guess lieutenant
what do you
f s sir
new respect tomcats
a long pause
respect in the cops eyes
he taps the navy id on the handlebars
staring at this sincere young man
a russian attack
but you have to be ready
the cop nods and stares at him
the bike is blurping
barely going fast enough to stay upright
maverick cool in shades and campaign cap dorks past the hanger with the sign fightertown usa
he pulls ahead
in back of him escorting with flashers
they pull up at the gate
maverick and goose salute the guard hands over their id
the chp gets out of his car leans against the door
maverick turns to him
remember one thing
outside of this gate
am top gun
the chp returns a snappy one
he gets back in his car and turns away
maverick receives his id and clearance
as he passes through a couple of pilots in flight suits ice and hollywood stare at him
the taller dark cool one speaks in a dry voice meant to be overheard
uh oh police escort
this one must be a real killer
the second pilot grins big at them
maverick turns slightly stares over his shades at them as he passes
goose grins back the challenge
the doors on the soundtrack
jets swoop missiles fire a plane explodes
gun camera views of migs sams flak bombing runs
during the korean war the navy kill ratio was twelve to one
we shot down twelve of their jets for every one of ours
in vietnam this ratio fell to three to one
our pilots depended on missles
they lost their dogfighting skills
f s fighting with f s
music becomes current
top gun was created to teach acm
air combat maneuvering
richthofen guynemer rickenbacker galland rudel bong would envy us
we do just what they did but we do it beyond the speed of sound
viper a tough looking confident leader in a blue flight suit stands before a video tape monitor
behind him on the monitor the dogfighting continues
by the end of vietnam we upped our kill ratio to thirteen to one
he turns on the lights
we see his audience in f
youre here cause youre the top one per cent of all naval aviators
sixteen young men eight flight crews sit at attention
they are trim fit and confident high school heroes college jocks
youre the elite the best of the best
were gonna make you better because youre job is damned important
the camera moves among them
hold on one of the men the one who greeted maverick at the gate ice
with the tensions in the world today the potential for confron tation is greater than ever and carrier pilots will be the first ones there
air combat excellence is vital
ice is not looking at the speaker but rather in our direction
hollywood a blond good looking pilot whispers something to him and gestures
ice is getting the lowdown on someone
the camera moves and we see who that someone is as maverick enters the frame
someone once asked me if training men for air combat made the world less safe flying loaded guns
an accidental confrontation and so forth
maverick feels the stare of the other man and glances in his direction
their eyes meet
ice smiles coldly
viper cont my answer is the dangerous thing is being unprepared
you want trouble thats what you get when things dont work out when you cant do what you say you can
when you dont know what you can do
and when your opponents arent sure either
we are not policy
we dont make policy
elected officials civilians do that
we are the instrument of policy
the tip of the spear
so we had best be sharp
maverick has turned to look at ice
ice glances back in his direction
maverick looks at the back of the room where guys in blue flight suits stand
they are the instructors
they look relaxed poised mean
goose is looking up front
where viper has stopped
goose nudges maverick
whispers what are you doing
thats singer isnt it
turn around pay attention
what are you doing
musing to himself just wondering
turns back who is the best
hes shocked to find viper staring right at him with a killer grin on his face
hes feels caught like a naughty schoolboy
smiles ya know
wed like to know whos best too
thats why weve got that plaque on the wall
with the top top gun crew from each class
you think maybe your names gonna be on it
maverick knows hes in trouble considers the social alternatives then tells him the truth
a couple of ooos and aahhs from the guys
the instructors stare the challenge at him
he slides lower in his seat
considering the company youre in thats a pretty arrogant attitude
somewhat chastised yes sir
i like that in a fighter pilot
couple of laughs from the guys its okay to be confident
you have to think youre king kong to want to try to land on carriers
just keep in mind the other component of success
viper gathers his notes the lecture is over
viper turns back for one more thought
gentlemen this is about combat
remember there are no points for second place
viper walks out
maverick finds goose looking at him quizzically
others mill around the plaque
a big friendly bear of a rio speaks
its not the plaque
the winner can get assigned here as instructor
he gets to fight every day
they move closer to examine the names on the plaque
fast cars in the driveway fast music blares into the night
its wednesday animal night
maverick goose hollywood and wolfman walk to the entrance
loud music low ceiling plaques of the squadrons line the walls
a dancer gyrates on stage largely ignored by pilots talking with their hands
every pretty girl in san diego seems to be here
its a noisy rowdy place a steam releaser for people under pressure
nevertheless there is a control to it all there are none of the usual bar types just pilots and naval officers
the ghost riders enter
the place is on fire a mob of dancers flashing lights blaring hard rock music
pilots talk flying and hustle girls
nearby an a pilot stands by the bar
he knows goose and speaks loudly for his benefit
you know the fighter pilots motto
its better to be dead than to look bad
they grin broadly
goose replies as they brush past
i dont know frank anybody gets off on bombing the shit out of dirt has got to be queer
goose exchanges friendly punches with the attack pilots
mavericks introductions and friendly barbs are drowned by the music
maverick is a bit reserved
he doesnt move among the crowd as naturally as goose does
hollywood and wolfman drift away searching for quarry
goose orders beer
he nods toward a tall young man across the room
keller black lion squadron
i knew him at pensacola
hes damn good
is there anybody in the navy you dont know
gotta keep track of the competition
goose suddenly reaches out and grabs a guy moving past
slider they let you into top gun
if youre among the best in the navy i tremble for the security of this country
why goose whose butt did you kiss to get here
the list is long but distinguished
sos my johnson
this is maverick
smiles good naturedly shakes hands with mav
so ive heard
whos your pilot
very impressed no shit
mister to you
you think you can stay up with us
i think yeah well show you a thing or two
this is evan mitchell he steers the thing
so i heard
steers it pretty close
sorry to hear about cougar
he was a good man
thats what i meant
suddenly behind them a flame shoots up
someone ducks his head and swallows it
the pilot sets an empty glass on the bar
what was that
sort of an institution around here
or maybe this is the institution i forget which
its the house drink
itll warm the cockles of your heart
and other things depending on where you spill it
he motions to the barmaid and she moves over sets them up
goose holds a demitasse glass
the barmaid pours drambuie
they look at goose apprehensively
goose looks at nearby flyers in camo fatigues
you cant show fear in front of marines
theyre like dobermans theyll go for your throat its instinctive
he takes out match and lights it
maverick holds his arm
you ever done this before
what been drunk
he downs it all in one gulp slaps the glass on the bar still aflame
he stands there blinking
how was it
could use a dash more jet fuel
the others are duly impressed
mavericks gaze falls on ice watching from the end of the bar slider takes one maverick takes one too downs it in a gulp
sundown taking up the challenge motions for one
the barmaid pours it
careful dont make an ash of yourself
he tries to drink the flaming concoction
he tries to go for a sip but its too close to his face he tries to tilt the flame away but that doesnt work
finally he goes for the gulp
he burns his lip and misses
he sets his hair on fire
it goes up in a whooosh
down in flames
he throws a beer in sundowns face quenching the fire
sundown blinks through the beer
thanks i needed that
you guys are not only crazy youre dangerous
ice comes up from the end of the bar
he motions the barmaid for another it comes
goose lights it
he gulps it down cool as hell
disdainfully frat boys
he walks away
slider goes after him
who is that guy
that why they call him ice
its the way he flies ice cold
wears you down
after enough time you just get bored and frustrated you do something stupid and hes got you
maverick moves in ices direction
he passes wolfman dancing with a girl with bright purple fingernails
why do you all have such funny names
you gotta have a call sign thats just your own
you have to recognize it immediately
then if someone shouts wolf break left
you react right away
why do they call you wolf
smiles oh i dont know
goose comes up with his arm around a girl
hey mav this is sally
she doesnt believe a word i say
tell her im married will you
yeah hes married but then again he s not dead
sally laughs and tries to pull goose back toward the dance floor
something in mavericks eyes makes him hang back with his partner
could i get a call sign
well i dont know
well it doesnt just happen you gotta do something famous
ill think of something
maverick smiles at this but seems on edge
he watches a few pretty girls enter and eye the pilots in their flight suits then turns and walks up to ice who sits drinking with slider
maverick walks over to him
ice notices sliders attention going to maverick
he turns and grins at him
figured it out yet
figured out what
who is the best
need a hint
i think i can work it out on my own
you like to work alone
ive heard that about you
ive heard of you too
you were in with bargamian
and you were with cougar
he was my roommate in flight school
hes a good man
you must have soloed under a lucky star
first the mig then you slide into cougars place
its not cougars place
what do you think it was
was it that mig contact that did it
got you here
were here because were the best flyers in the wing
not because of some mig encounter
guys fly their whole career without seeing a mig up close
you mean notorious
something in the way he says it
its not quite a joke more an insult
mavericks about to take the whole conversation too far when something
someone catches his eye
she catches quite a few eyes in this room
she is very pretty and shes walking in on the arm of a commander
maverick turns back but the moment has passed
ice dismisses him with a nod and weak smile
goose pulls him away
what do these guys think i made cougar quit
pay no attention to it
theyre just trying to rattle you
its all psychological
he deposits maverick at a chair by a table where other pilots cluster watching and listening to bugs shoot down his wristwatch
we were just really diving down and by then we were right over downtown haiphong
it was some great shit
jack says what are you doing
what what am i doing jack
he says what are you doing
i said im rolling in jack
bugs were at thirty two hundred feet
oh shit we were like zooom
so we scraped down at hundred feet right over downtown hanoi
oh shit goddamn it
and blowing down the river
and so once we were there we let down to about fifty feet just going down the river and jack says
dont ever do that again
okay right jack ill never do that again
maverick pays little or no attention
he broods and drinks
suddenly hollywood nudges him he turns
what what is it
check your six
never mind mine
long legs great ass beautiful
her six is a ten
uh oh a turn to engage
maverick sees a stranger and somehow he knows he knows even then
wolfman turns sees her walking too
you presume that hostile
well we should contact and check it out
she has turned toward them
she passes by
they start to make a move for her
but just then she finds her date at the bar a distinguished man with captains stripes
their smiles freeze and they slide back in their chairs
maverick cant stop looking at her
after a while the intensity of his gaze draws her attention
she feels him
she is nodding and smiling to her date but her eyes scan the room like radar
a warning tone goes off in his brain dolu dolu dolu as they lock on him
he feels that thrill of excitement and fear you get when you know youre targeted in someones scope
her eyes hold on him for a long moment
long enough and then sweep by the rest of the room
she turns her attention back to the captain and laughs at something he says
over in a corner goose chats up a couple of san diego girls
the family unit thats the most important thing
its the only thing you can count on
im married did i tell you that
we dont believe you
ive been married since i was eighteen
why dont you believe me
because you dont look married
youre not even wearing a ring
big smile i take it off when im chasing women
its the only honorable thing to do
hes half listening to bugs rattle on
his eyes are drawn back to the woman
he tries not to stare
she seems to know a lot of people in the club
he looks away
hollywood is chatting up a girl with a sincerity that cannot be taught
his line is just as polished as his appearance
you dont think about death up there but you think a lot about the danger
one mistake and youre a smoking hole in the ground
i never knew it was so dangerous
oh yeah it makes everything down here more meaningful
you feel a certain intensity of life and you want to grab onto every moment
maverick looks up at the bar again
she charlie is staring right at him intensely as her date whispers something in her ear
she notices him staring back quickly looks away embarrassed
she says something to the man
he nods and turns away as someone else grabs his attention
the woman now wouldnt look this way for anything
she picks up her purse from the bar and walks through the crowd and out of the room
impulsively mavericks up he follows
he breaks out looks around doesnt see her
someone disappears around a corner
he moves after
corner a door slams shut
impulsively before he realizes what he is doing hes through it
a feminine gasp
he should have looked at the sign on the door
the realization of where he is hits him too late
she is standing by the mirror with her make up out looking back at him
hes not quite sure what to do
a hasty retreat would be appropriate if embarrassing
ah what the hell he is a fighter pilot
he just walks right over to her
no idea what he will say
shes got her lipstick out twisting it
she looks over at him with an amused smile
long cruise was it
she leans over the sink puts on lipstick sees his eyes cover her
anything i can do to help lieutenant
lots of things
he is sort of attractive but there are other girls in the room she doesnt want to be too encouraging
she tries not to grin at his embarrassment
anything i can do for you
she laughs again doesnt know what it is
could be chemical but shes instinctively attracted
it might be safer
she hands him a makeup mirror
starts redoing her lipstick
he just stares at her
she looks up at him than back to her warpaint
finally when it comes it is cool and amused
now i know why all the girls come here
they know how horny you guys get
its not that
shes toying with him
well it is
it is that too
thats a big comfort to me
i could be too
save you from a big mistake with that other guy
and on to a bigger one with you
yeah most likely
was there ever a girl who didnt like fighter pilots
i heard of one once
she laughs again shakes her head
she gently takes the compact out of his hands snaps it closed
im really flattered lieutenant but i dont go out with pilots
then what are you doing here
three pretty blondes enter and look at maverick quizzically but not without interest
i think the question is
what are you
she tries to keep a straight face as she walks out of the room
the other girls look at him expectantly
he just stands there then realizes hes holding her lipstick
im here to talk about a new concept in cosmetics
she returns spots the captain motioning to her
maverick enters goes to the other end of the bar
he orders a drink
he drinks it pays for it moves off toward the door
someone backs into his path he moves quickly and bumps into someone else her
she sees its him
should have watched where i was going
her hand goes to his collar
she adjusts his insignia
wheres your wing man
whos watching your six
uh nobody i guess
one final adjustment
she breaks the spell abruptly turns away
see you around
maverick finds his voice
can i walk you out
she turns back to him a smile
im with someone
from a car in the parking lot we see charlie and the captain leave the club
they walk directly toward us and stop
she turns says something polite
a peck on the cheek
he turns away
a dome light briefly illuminates the interior of the car as a door opens
it rocks slightly as someone gets in
charlie turns back and walks over taking her keys out
she opens the door to the car and gets in
she starts the car and pulls away
suddenly a figure sits up in the back
i thought hed never leave
startled she nearly drives off the road
she turns to him startled
what are you doing here
everybodys got to be somewhere
what if captain dawson had come with me
it would have been really embarrassing
how did you know this was my car
sleek and stylish
its your color
matches your lipstick
and i asked someone
you think youre pretty smart
i think im in love
she pulls up at the guard gate a marine corporal is on duty
he sees the pretty girl pull up and stop leans over helpfully
can i help you maam
she smiles even more sweetly
i dont know corporal
can you do anything about this lunatic
the car door swings open
maverick gets out
the car roars away
he stands in the glare of the spotlight
rocking on his heels looking across at the guard who snaps to attention and stares holes in his chest
two guys in flight suits run down stairs past stencils of mig kills on walls then down corridor
not so fast
they skid to stop outside a door
ground crews work on planes in b
jester in middle of lecture
door bursts open
sundown and flex skid to a halt when they see whole class looking at them
who are you
viper breaks in indicating flex
and who are you
you dont look like flex to me
you call that muscle
doesnt look like muscle
even sundown has to laugh scratching his chest
whatre you laughing at
dont make an issue of it itll stick
fungus unhappily itll stick anyway
viper turns away
now to continue
in this class we will be dealing with f s and a s as our mig simulators
technically the f does not have the thrust to weight ratio of the mig it also does not bleed energy below knots like the mig does
the a does not turn as well as the mig but has significantly better visibility
maverick looks back to his notes
viper looks up to back of room door
good our tagrefs here
charlies the most qualified to get into p subs and curves and vn diagrams
maverick turns to see the tagref walk forward
maverick stares at her as she passes without acknowledging him
he is surprised embarrassed
charlotte blackwood code name charlie not your ordinary tagref
charlie has her ph
in astrophysics shes a civilian contractor so you dont salute her
or anything else
is that clear
she walks to the front and starts her presentation
she talks about something very technical arcane
mig tactics technology
as the briefing rattles on maverick reacts to her
goose glances over at him
he too recognizes the girl
he looks at his partner
maverick feels his stare
hello i think i have some new data for you
now a mig has a problem with the inverted flight tanks
it wont do a negative g push over
even below one g they risk a flame out
operationally they will do a zero to one g only
a snicker from the audience
she hesitates momentarily goes on
the latest intelligence shows that the most they will do in operation is one
is there something wrong lieutenant
i dont think youre altogether right
about the mig that is
she stops some of the pilots look at him
i beg your pardon
no i beg yours
but i dont think youre right on that
i saw one
you saw a mig
i saw a mig do a g negative dive
she doesnt believe him where did you see that
nervous buzz in the room
viper goes rigid
charlie cant believe it
like hollywood says i could tell you but then id have to kill you
pork stifles a laugh the others chuckle
viper is embarrassed
she stops viper with a glance
its all right
she can handle it
she is very cool not overbearing
she says it calmly
she doesnt want to embarrass him any more than he is but she has to get the facts straight
lieutenant i have a top secret clearance
the pentagon sees to it that i know more than you
not in this case
you saw a mig push negative g
where were you
on his six
little stifled laughs
he was in a g negative dive and you were on his six
yes maam at first
then i was directly above him
she stares at him for a moment then she has him
she goes for the kill
if you were directly above him how did you see him
i was inverted
a real buzz in the room
ice laughs audibly
you were in a g inverted dive with a mig
she cant believe it
at what range
chuckles barely suppressed
goose pipes up to deflect attention
one and a half actually
i got a polaroid
what were you doing there
giving him the bird
she thinks its at her
she grows red
he shows her but she can handle this
so youre the reason those salt talks failed
the room breaks into laughter
now he grows red
goose puts his hand on mavericks arm shakes his head as if to say let it go pal she got you
she looks at viper
he doesnt know whether to laugh or cry
he knows theres something here he doesnt control
its just like he says sir
he snaps i dont care
she walks away
he runs up and stops her
why didnt you tell me you were a she studies him coolly for a moment like a specimen
it never came up
you let me make a fool of myself
you seemed determined to do that anyway
why didnt you tell me you were a famous mig insulter
would it have made a difference
you know im assigned to this school
i see sixteen new hotshots every eight weeks
your attention is flattering but not really productive
why dont you keep your mind on flying
she reaches over and aligns his collar insignia
why cant you keep this straight
she smiles at him and walks away
maverick turns sees the others sizing him up
most of them grin
maverick moves down the corridor past the cos office
viper leans against the doorsill
he lights a pipe laconically eyes maverick
his tone gives away nothing like an elint probe eliciting a response
whered you get that call sign
runs in the family sir
youre father was marvin mitchell
a good man
viper turns away
thank you sir
maverick watches him for a beat hes been tested but hes not sure how or why
he turns to catch up with goose and the others
at twenty eight thousand feet the two planes circle each other going in opposite directions
as they jockey for position they snap past each other like ends of bullwhips
the earth spins the horizon appears and disappears
with each hard turn maverick and goose can be heard grunting to keep blood in their brains to keep from passing out
the fight is hard physical and exhausting
the extreme g forces
flatten them against their seats causing their heads to weigh over one hundred pounds
maverick strains to turn his head and track the other jet as it streaks past at mach one
ive lost him where is he
on your six coming hard
hes on your six and closing fast
maverick jerks the stick left and the f takes an astonishing turn
jester roars past into a wide arc
great he shouldve had me
take it down
lets bug out of here
call for a draw
ill nail him this time
the plane explodes into afterburner rocketing toward space
jester is left in direct line with the sun and his canopy is sprayed with a blinding glare
going ballistic is dangerous
the plane flys like a bullet obeying the laws of physics not the pilots touch on control surfaces
the ballistic call warns other aircraft that he is for the moment out of control
hes blind you got him
hes out of energy
you got control
the f peels over the egg in a backward dive
it rockets down the outside gaining energy
over the roar of jets the scream of the wind goose shouts data but it is muffled a distant voice in a typhoon
through the canopy we see jester and he hangs in the air like a sparrow in the path of a falcon
pilots pov hud in windscreen a diamond in a box
maverick lines up the diamond with jester and we hear the high pitched tone beeping
were at ten thousand
i got you sucker
youre going down
jester maneuvers but maverick keeps him in the gunsight
the beeping is louder faster
in the envelope
fox two missile stunned goddamn
we beat him
there is an edge of anger in jesters voice
they are brought up short for a moment then the thrill of victory gets the best of them
goose lets out a war whoop
the f sweeps up rolls into an immelman
we did it
look ma top of the world
mavericks tomcat breaks hard and high rolls over on its side wings perpendicular to the ground
goose sees the world go sideways
a little high on the left dont you think
he aileron rolls another quarter turn
inverted they pass right down the runway
goose looks out and insouciantly watches the world go by at knots upside down
what do you call this
its a victory roll
i wouldnt call it victory
its more like
officers watch the landing activity
one old salt turns from the coffee machine a cup of steaming java microns from his lips
the tomcat roars over
he yelps as hot coffee flys all over his shirt
they complete the roll bank left zoom right by the tower level with the observation window
f s pov
controllers look out at the f mouths drop open
he waves jauntily
how ya doing in there
you know at one point i did want a navy career
come on relax
you see all those guys with gold on their shoulders
oh no i think that was johnson air boss of the kitty hawk
come on we beat an instructor
how many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll
just once if they take your plane away
they roll out break over the runway
maverick and goose walk by parking tomcats
ice is unstrapping slider is climbing down
ice looks at maverick says one word
maverick keeps walking
goose hangs back
always a good idea to show up your instructors
he nods toward jester glaring at them from his a
goose indicates the backseat of the tomcat
hey see any controls back there
thinks about team loyalty reacts to jesters glare
we beat the son of a bitch
he turns and runs to catch up with maverick
pilots half undressed
maverick and goose enter the room carrying their helmets
the students look up at them and goose suddenly flashes a thumbs up sign with a grin
the students react with clenched fists ad libs high fives victory punches
oooo they all go ooo and laugh
got our butts kicked
thats all it took to blow us out of the sky
we went like this he went like that
i say to hollywood whered he go
hollywood says whered who go
and hes laughing
right over the radio hes laughing at us
attention turns to the doorway as ice and slider enter
ice gives a brief dramatic pause then flashes thumbs up and smiles
the students celebrate ices win
ice handles the attention with the easy composure of one who is used to it
maverick ignores him and begins to peel out of his g suit
ice moves toward his locker
hollywood maverick and goose won too
ice talks into his locker
thats not what i heard
ice turns back stares them down then turns back into his locker dismissing them
below the hard deck doesnt count
you guys are the second team arent you
maverick gets up moves to him starts to say something when jester breaks into the room
screaming and yelling
a lot of screaming and yelling muffled by the door
enlisted yeomen and chiefs go about their clerical duties in acute embarrassment mixed with curiousity
behind the cos door someone is screaming his head off
the door bursts open
a big brawling officer johnson the air boss blasts out nearly smashing into a female petty officer
she almost spills her coffee
johnson looks right and left in fury too strong for words
he looks like he wants to smash something
they move out of his way but he justs blasts through the door and disappears down the hall
the enlisted men turn to vipers office
jester stands inside stonefaced
maverick and goose are rigid
with excess calm deliberation softly walks over grasps the doornob
he glances in this direction
the glance is totally without expression and even scarier for that
in a flash each man finds something totally engrossing in his work or something terribly important to do elsewhere
slowly steadily viper swings his door closed
he moves over to face maverick
there is a silence like after a train wreck nothing but the popping of sprung metal and the low gasp of escaping steam
viper speaks quietly like a funeral director consoling the living
makes you want to scream
that about covers the flyby
jester almost breaks into a grin
you broke two major rules of engagement
maverick gives no response
lieutenant candela lost sight of you and called no joy
you failed to respond
he stops and looks at maverick
maverick finally nods why
maverick is exhausted
its been a long rough day
his voice is a horse whisper
i had him in view
i was peeling over the egg into a dive
he saw me when i moved in for the kill
there wasnt any danger
to goose is that how you remember it
by the time we could respond we were diving right into his view
viper is not satisfied with the answer but he moves on
the hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet
jester at what point did you call off the fight
just below ten thousand
but you continued to fight
another pause another grudging nod
we werent below for more than ten seconds
there was no danger
i had the shot
i took it
the rules of engagement are not flexible
they exist for your safety
you will obey them
is that clear
maverick thinks about continuing the discussion but the thought is momentary
he quickly cuts his losses gives viper what he thinks he wants
he is just on the cusp of too sincere
yes sir perfectly clear
i guess we were
just a little over enthusiastic
viper measures him for a moment then lets it go
i guess you were
maverick and goose leave the room
viper looks at jester picks up mavericks fitness report
doesnt read it looks back at jester
i dont know what to tell you skip
tell me one thing
if you had to go into combat would you want him with you
jester turns walks slowly around the room
the walls are lined with pictures planes and pilots
there are mig killers attack squadrons ground personnel
theres one picture of a phantom in flight with the backseater mooning the camera
other pictures show carriers famous flyers previous cos
finally jester replys
viper slaps shut the fitness report
hes seat of the pants
completely unpredictable nothing by the book
all over the sky
but i dont know skip hes really got something
yeah we get one of these guys every damn class
he throws the report on the desk
yup a wild pony
wind roar jet whine
hollywood and wolfman are being thrown about as hollywood fights the stick
look out you lost it
they depart flight
the horizon swings wildly as they go into flat spin
a face appears at feet right in front of their canopy
gooses eyes bug at them
man you guys gooned it
your laser butts are scattered across kansas
disgusted with himself come on
i died enough for one night
they climb out of the simulator a cockpit sprung on moveable rams surrounded by a dome on which video images are projected
as they climb down maverick and goose climb up into the cockpit to take their place
have you guys ever considered career counseling
simulator control room filled with computers tape transports and video screen representations of computer generated combat
now maverick flies it as charlie and other techs watch
maverick flys the heck out of it
it lurches and bumps the noises and sights look real
he gets on the tail of a mig
it breaks he breaks then what he does is just too fast to follow
it screams around in a turn
suddenly there is a whummp
the lights come on
what did you do in there
what did you do
you broke it
maverick and goose enter
the techs cluster around the keyboards trying to reprogram to figure out what went wrong
you flew it off the template
nobody ever did that before
thats what she said last night
she stares at goose until he grins and moves off to give the others his valuable opinions on how to reprogram the computers
what is it about you
he just shrugs at her and smiles
what would you say too fast
and far too aggressive
it is combat
every second counts
the hottest moves in the world arent gonna help you if you wind up alone
your wingmans got to be able to follow you
know that he can depend on you
its more than just fancy flying
well what you need
what you have to keep looking for
what you want to get is a wingman who can stay up with you
who can match you move for move
then youve got something
that stuff about the mig
i was out of line
is that all
what else do you want
there you go with those moves again
i dont mix with the boys
i work here
lets keep it professional
ill give you that
give me a break im asking you out
i thought there was something
that night in the club
you know the rules of engagement
cant believe it
some one comes up hot on your six what do you do
what are you talking about
you turn into him check him out identify friend or foe
im not your foe
and if hes harmless you disengage
what if hes not
you have to shoot him down
if hes smart hell turn away before that happens
nobody ever called me harmless before
and probably never again
its nothing personal
i know a lot of pilots
maybe im immune
dont worry im a new strain
and i dont give up
everything ive ever wanted ive had to work like hell for
well how about it
how about what
how about anything anything you want to do
hard to argue with that isnt it
a walk in the park
what about the plane
most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit
play with the levers and things
well get used to it
used to what
im starting to sense that now
youre slow to engage
but youll come around
she pushes him out the door lets make it at eight
ive gotta work
she closes the door turns back to her screen
thru omitted a day off
pilots other personnel are enjoying a day at the beach
there are bikinis and beer sunfishes and water skiing
the annual over the line a variation of softball tournament is in progress
the team from the teddy kennedy driving school is whipping another known as scum de terre
the pilots are doing pretty well at blowing off steam
undulating sea grass
muffled hiss of the surf
a pretty fish comes into view
a spear shoots through it and nails it to the ocean floor
two figures pop to the surface and wade in to the beach
maverick holds the wriggling fish
charlie is repulsed
she pulls off her mask and snorkle follows him in to shore
they flop down
he drops the fish in front of her sees her reaction at watching its death throes
whyd you do that
surprised i had the shot
she looks at him for a moment then turns away fiddles with her mask
youre an animal
what are you
i dont enjoy watching things suffer
he smashes the fish on a rock
it is still
its not suffering anymore
she looks at him strangely half jokes youre horrible youre not cause you eat frozen meatballs
he puts it down things die
every time you breathe you kill millions of tiny organisms
every time you eat something had to die
you dont have to kill it
its more honest this way
you do your own dirty work
you ever think about killing another human being
about as much as they think about killing me
does it bother you
they know the rules
this is too strong for her she turns away he comes around to her
thats the deal
thats why youre up there
its him or me
thats the price of admission
she draws away it bothers you why
youre part of it
she stiffens hes losing her
he softens everybody dies
most people dont get to die for something
you dont want to confront it do you
you want to keep it all clean cerebral
velocity vectors wing load diagrams
you ever been up
you use your mind to keep things at a distance
you ever just let go
she doesnt answer
you know what really scares me
living too long
losing my hair and my teeth
and my guts and my wind
and my brains
sitting in a room with my hands in my lap watching daytime tv
you dont believe any of this
you dont think youll ever die
thats it of course
when im up there and doing it im cheating it every second
im subverting all laws
im skating the edge of it
what he said
theres nothing so exhilarating as being shot at without result
all youve got is one life
i guess its worth about the same to every body
you ever see an old woman after her husband has died
and the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead
when youre in the air and doing something really dangerous you can look ahead
maybe ten seconds
thats your whole future
thats as far as it goes
but imagine what those seconds are worth
what if you kill yourself
think of everything youll miss
there is lots of stuff i dont know about
i guess if i live long enough ill get to it
if i dont ill never miss it
are you really that brave
shakes his head no
i watched my mother die
she had a long time to think about it
they say you reach an agreement with death
come to accept the fact that pretty soon you wont be here
i didnt see that
was very brave
braver than i am
you go up there there isnt time to think
if you make a mistake youre just a smudge on the ground
simplifies funeral arrangements
its just as i thought
youre totally insane
he smiles thanks very much
he lifts the fish care for some suchi
a killer volleyball game in progress
maverick and charlie wander toward it talking softly to themselves
goose runs up and grabs him away
come on were next
come on i got over six bucks on the line
maverick looks up and sees the other two man team the victors waiting on the other side of the net for them
of course it had to be ice and slider
charlie sits and watches as the game gets immediately out of hand
in moments maverick and ice rotate to forward positions directly opposite each other across the net
other revelers turn to watch as it degenerates
to more than a game
maverick glances at charlie
he seems uncomfortable but irrevocably drawn into the confrontation
she says nothing but her attitude is apparent
back to the game slider and goose set them up as they try to spike the ball in each others face
the final point
up over the middle
they both go up maverick smashes ice blocks but the ball sails away off his forearm
for the first time ever maverick beats him
he looks over at charlie she is staring out to sea
she looks back at him and hes suddenly had enough competition
they call for another game but maverick turns away
come on come on
its double or nothing
were talking twelve bucks american here
ive had enough
he grabs charlie and his gear
you want to go ballistic
i dont know
i dont like being out of control
he looks back at ice bouncing the ball and staring at him
stick with me youll get used to it
the bike doing mph
charlie is unfazed
he turns to check her out she smiles back at him
the bike is parked in front
montage on locked off camera to show the passage of time
the latticed terrace streaks of light
maverick is feeding a dog
charlie sits on a rail watching him
i always wanted to fly
ever since i first saw a jet
i wanted to fly jets then i wanted f s then i wanted to fly off carriers then i wanted top gun
and now i want you
you always get what you want
i dont know yet
he puts money in jukebox
she watches him
eye to eye contact
the music comes on
i want it understood
no fooling on base no signs no comments no talk
im a professional
you guys are in my line of work
a long beat
he looks at her makes the pact like a sailor
she looks at his eyes for any sign of a put on insincerity
finally he smiles at her but she can read it
she moves in and covers his grin with a gentle kiss
to them sitting within striking distance at a table
the dog sleeps beneath
their eyes are now locked
the electricity almost arcs between them
tcu scrub pine table
their fingertips touch
waist to head
holding close together swaying in time with the music
their lips gently brush
an f swoops over the desert roars over an antenna complex
in its missile rack it carries a tacts transponder
the tacts range is an area of the desert completely enveloped by computerized radar
the computers calculate a number of aircrafts positions and velocities by means of transponders in the ships and ground stations that talk to each other thousands of times a second
using this system it is possible to track aerial combat instantaneously and give pilots directions and also to play back the combats for analysis
the double viewing screens are five feet high high technology state of the art
on the screens are computer animated figures showing jets from various angles
flight data is displayed
the operators punch buttons to show various points of view of the battle a pilots p
from overhead a long range p
showing topography of the landscape and height of mountains
students and instructors sit on chairs in the peanut gallery facing viper at the front of the room
charlie is in the back
the bandit has good position right here
all right freeze here
the moment of choice maverick is defensive
he has a chance to bug out right here
better to retire and save your plane than force a bad position
stay in the diamond another three seconds the bandit will blow you out of the sky
make a hard right select zone
turns to maverick to drive point home you can extend and escape
you make a bad choice
the computerized rendering resumes on the screen
viper cont you perform a split s
thats the last thing you should do
the bandit is right on your tail freeze there
the bandit has you in his gunsight
what were you thinking here maverick
i wasnt thinking
i just did it
big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane
smiling no guts no glory
its a joke
viper doesnt like that answer at all but some of the students laugh and mockingly whistle at the cockiness of it
they give maverick the high sign
slider leans forward to him
maverick slumps down in his chair under vipers glare
the computer rendering rolls forward again
he glances back at charlie
she smiles sympathetically at him
unfortunately the gamble worked or you might have learned something
the bandit never gets a clean shot
maverick makes an aggressive vertical move here comes over the top and defeats the bandit with a missile shot
the encounter was a victory but weve shown it as an example of what not to do
ice is next
another computerized rendering comes up on the screen
hollywood leans close to maverick and speaks quietly
gutsiest move i ever saw
maverick gives him a small nod of appreciation
and the dumbest
okay look at this
ice takes control of the battle immediately
he never gives the bandit a chance to take the offensive
an early turn here excellent
he goes for the jugular and its over just that quick
lets run that again its exactly how it should be done
omitted in full flight gear carrying their helmets and trying to stuff food down their gullets the students rush stumble toward the flight line
hollywood takes a bit of a sandwich and makes a face
what the hell is this
dont chew it you wont have it that long
easier to clean the cockpit if it comes up in big chunks
jester yells from the distance
on the run
a fighter pilots lunch
a hot dog and a puke
they scurry ahead overtaking the others
i was a victim of circumstance
they should have warned you about that one
shes kinky for flight suits said that shed never seen so many zippers played with them all night
the noise alone kept me up
whatd you do
pulled left rolled out underneath
its kind of ironic
all you guys have women troubles and i dont
thats because you dont have any women
until last night
did you see the moves i was making on that girl at the party
the girl with the purple fingernails
thats her tall hungry woman with fire in her eyes
it was great
it was bad
the girl with the purple fingernails was coogans sister
they all laugh
wolfman looks stunned
coogan spent half the night looking for her
he said he was gonna kill the son of a bitch who ruined his sister
i didnt ruin her
you didnt help
she came ruined
ya think he knows it was me
seemed not to
but its hard to know
you never can tell whats in the mind of a psychopath
wolfman looks very unsettled
hear about ice
he won again
goose walks beside maverick now
something bothering you
lets just go fight
wolfman looks very apprehensive as they approach the f s
mechanics surround both planes making last minute checks of all systems
among them is coogan six and a half feet tall looking mean
maverick tosses him a wave
hows it goin coog
ever find your sister coogan
you guys know somethin about that
wolfman swallows hard and hurries quickly into the plane
coogan glares at them all with a look that could kill
hollywood leads maverick follows
they point their noses down and dive
two bogies fly side by side at five thousand outlined against the blue pacific
smaller slower they seem helpless for a moment
we hear the instructors in the f s
filtered holy shit its viper
keep your shirt on hes saying holy shit its us
the bogies split
bogey one hard left
bogey two hard right
hollywood sweeps left pursuing bogey one
maverick hangs back to cover him
bogey one makes a strong vertical move
hollywood stays on him
bogey one loops and comes down and hollywood almost loses him for a moment before regaining the angle
bogey at three oclock high
maverick looks quickly at three oclock high sees bogey two returning to the fight
he jerks the stick right and the two planes make a quick pass
just cover wood maverick
mutual support man
im gonna take him goose
dont be greedy
stay with wood
i want him
maverick goes suddenly vertical zooms straight up
hey come on hey
maverick loops the f down to get the quick angle on viper in bogey two
viper takes off running from the fight again
maverick looks over his shoulder and sees that hollywood still has a good position on bogey one
he takes a hard right and streaks off after viper
what what are you doing
i want viper
goose looks back at hollywood and bogey one
but were cover
viper streaks across the sky with maverick close behind
he pushes the throttle forward to zone full afterburner
viper shows all his tricks
hard left hard right rolling into vertical flipping into a dive
maverick stays with him
viper to himself goddamn rookie youre all right
maverick turns to get viper in the diamond
he hears a sidewinder growl in his headset
whats the range goose
ive got a good tone
viper jinks but maverick stays with him
viper is in the diamond and the tone goes crazy
three oclock high nine oclock high
they come out of nowhere flashing down toward maverick a crossfire ambush
mavericks eyes are startled
maverick is stunned
he has been tricked humiliated
theres a little salt for the wound as viper and jester celebrate
slaps his helmet like a dolt
several pilots in various forms of undress
maverick and goose sit with their heads down a hangdog expression on their faces
maverick mopes at the bar a figure comes up behind him
ya know that was the best flying ive seen since nam
he grins right up to that part where you got killed
viper sits down
hes in a jovial taunting mood
maverick watches him guardedly
twenty years experience i couldnt shake you
you may be a great flyer
i mean that
of course you did
i said a great flyer not a smart one
you fly reckless
that ambush today you followed your emotions instead of your wingman
of course you got killed
and well deserved to
it was a really stupid mistake
in battle it gets people killed
maverick nods and stares at his beer
i can take care of myself
talent is no holy shield
von richtofen was killed by a farm boy
instincts are not enough
do it our way
weve worked these things out
the good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive
he studies him for a moment why do you have to do everything the hard way
its my own way
it works for me
i dont care about the rest of that stuff
then why are you here
for the same reason you are
oh you mean the thrill
id go up there ten times a day to fight
id win at least nine of them
thats all i want to do
its what i do best
i am real good
just give me the jet
viper studies him its not a gift just a loan
he finishes his beer then rises
nine out of ten is okay as long as its only fun and games
but this isnt about that
this is serious business
it is dangerous up there
at knots things can change a lot in a second
discipline is what protects us
he signals the bartender and drops some money on the bar
he stretches looks around
it was a good day
you learned something
you lost and youre still alive to think about it
and you lost your wingman
thats a cardinal sin
dont ever do it again
you owe hollywood an apology and you owe me a beer
viper touches mavericks shoulder as he moves away
it was just the gesture maverick needed for he seems to relax from his tension
he sips his beer alone
maverick and goose move through the terminal anxious expectant looks on their faces
relationships are a bitch here
its hard enough to concentrate under the pressure
having a woman here is asking for it
i guess thats what im doing then
where do you find the time
where do you find the energy
its tough enough to keep your mind on school
a woman here is a real pain in the
a pretty woman emerges from the crowd and spots them first
she rushes them happily carrying her sleepy four year old ricky
goose undergoes an immediate change beaming a big smile that he has practiced on her for years
she sets down the kid
hi honey god am i glad to see you
i missed you
goose wraps his arms around carol smack a kiss
she smiles at maverick turns back to goose
i had to come willard i got so lonesome i just couldnt stand it
sure honey i understand
its great to see you
hey wheres your backseater wheres the worlds smallest rio
he looks all around and then down at the kid hiding shyly behind his mothers skirts
goose grabs up the kid and zooms him around a game theyve played before every six months or so
the kid laughs happily
maverick just sort of smiles to himself and shakes his head
maverick comes to the surface
she enters frame by the side of the pool
she hands him a split fresh pineapple
he eats it in the most salacious manner possible
hes so contented hes babbling
in that order
im still second best
you ever fly an f
i dont fly in anything that doesnt show movies
he gets out grabs a towel moves over to some chairs
his flight suit is draped over one
he moves it to sit down
ahhh youd love it
night carrier landings
the most dangerous thing you can think of
next to you
and the most exciting
youre living at one hundred and ten per cent
greatest high in the world
doesnt it ever bother you
why whats gonna happen
his flight suit slips onto the ground
charlie retrieves it
as she lifts the suit something falls out of the pocket
looks like a gold coin
she picks it up
maverick is drying his hair
she holds the object out to him questioning
he sees it quickly takes it stuffs it back into his pocket
what do you take me for
its a navy cross
just good luck
whered you get it
whats to eat
he roots through a picnic basket
mig sweep over the water
you will proceed down the one seven zero degree radial looking for migs
you will engage all that you find destroy them and return to base
maverick has the lead
all right lets go
move like youve got a purpose
four f s fly in formation over the pacific searching for migs
they spot them engage
the combatants fly scissor patterns slashing past each other angling for position
we hear the voices of combat from the planes a barrage of information exchanges between pilots and rios
maverick and ice swoop close together on each others wing moving on each other testing they glance at each other and nod
the fight is on
suddenly an f rises up out of the clouds in front of them ice has the advantage and rolls in on him
the f sees his pursuers
goes into a hard left
ice struggles against the gs to bring his nose to bear
they go around into a lufbery a tight circle ice has the advantage
he is closer to the f s tail than the f is to his
but he cant close cant line up the shot
he grunts and strains as the g force pushes him down
maverick maneuvers close to their left circle
maverick is pulling a log of gs but cant target his weapons he continues to turn in a hard circle going round and round without gaining
he cant bring his nose to bear
maverick dives down between the two planes pulling
gs exposing his underside to ice
all ice sees is belly
obviously in this attitude maverick cant see him
he slams the stick hard right in toward maverick
ice quickly rolls up right in front of him
maverick sees him flash into his view
he has to slam the stick forward to avoid collision
he swings by real close
they pass through ices turbulence
the blast distorts the airflow to mavericks left engine
the engine flames out
full thrust on the right engine swings the tail around in a yaw
maverick slams the stick right to correct but too late
planes coupling up
planes coupling up
the plane couples one yaw to the next the tail swings around which becomes an ever increasing flat spin like an out of control frisbee
this is not good
rising panic were low
maverick is pinned to the instrument panel by centrifugal force desperately tries to reach back for the ejection lever but is falling short by about a foot
im pinned to the panel
time to go
i cant eject
the plane is spinning ever faster out of control
he drops the gear
goose is closer to center of spin g forces are less
he reaches behind him for the eject handle starts the eject sequence
ill do it
i cant reach
the canopy blasts away but is held spinning above the cockpit by the vortex of the sinking jet
goose glances up at it
goose yanks the ejection handle
things happen in a split second
goose is fired up and out by the rocket under his seat
almost instantly he impacts the spinning canopy
a sickening crunch
the canopy is knocked away
maverick is slammed back in his seat as the ejection seat straps wind up
he is blasted out of the plane just before it spins in
hes in shock
the loud thumping of his heart labored breathing a scream that stays in his mind
instinctively he gropes for straps
he releases the pilot seat it tumbles away
his chute streams balloons open snapping his body like a bullwhip
he drifts momentarily then plunges into the sea
his face distorted in the water wild eyes disoriented choking for air
he reaches out finds nothing to grab
suddenly he is yanked hard to the side
the parachute is caught by the wind and dragged pulling maverick along beneath the surface
he is twisting in the water turning over and over trying desperately to slip out of the tangled straps
he finally hits the surface of the water and sucks air into his lungs
with the end of his strength he hits the release snaps and breaks free from the parachute
it whips away like a kite in a typhoon
the sea is choppy and rough
he struggles as his equipment drags him under
he twists finds the inflatable raft attached to his harness
maverick pulls the cord and the raft hisses open
he pulls his body into the six by two foot raft and collapses completely exhausted
the survival has been almost without thinking an instinctual physical struggle
maverick begins to focus on the situation
he stains the water with dye then sees another parachute floating nearby
paddling to the parachute he reaches over the side and begins to pull on the heavy cords that are submerged in the water
a great struggle
the weight is extremely heavy
finally he pulls a body to the surface
goose is dead
maverick releases the parachute and pulls goose into the raft on top of him
he holds goose in his arms
his mind shuts down again
from high above the ocean we see the debris on the water
an oil slick pieces of honeycomb titanium and the small helpless figure in the raft
searchlights skim over the black ocean
a brilliant light flashes as maverick pops a pencil flare
helicopter blades flick powerfully
the lights of the choppers descend toward the wreckage area scanning the debris searching for life
the spotlights find maverick and goose in the raft
the draft from the chopper churns the water
a frogman drops from the chopper and hits with a heavy splashes
he surfaces and swims to the raft as a rescue harness is lowered
maverick watches curiously as he starts to examine goose
he hugs goose closer and looks threatened
let him go sir
take it easy
he tries to pry goose free but maverick has a death grip on the body
let him go
its all right
let him go
maverick glares at the man as he bobs in the water
another long moment then maverick releases goose
the frogman quickly straps maverick into the harness
he watches the lifeless body in the water as he is pulled up and away
he shivers from the cold
extreme close on mavericks face
he is emotionless
his eyes are flat and absolutely without expression
there is complete silence in the room
then we hear the quiet calm probing voice of viper
how do you feel
goose is dead
i was there
not one sign of emotion from maverick
not one tone of expression
we see viper now and his face is strained from a very long day
if you fly jets long enough something like this happens to you
no one escapes it
it touches us all
maverick looks at viper and his eyes are very disturbed
my responsibility my rio
my first squadron in vietnam we lost eight out of eighteen planes
the first one kills you but therell be others you can count on it
no reaction from maverick
he cant quite face up to that reality right now
youve got to put him in the box
maverick is watching viper but he doesnt have anything to say
the radio plays john lennon stand by me
maverick opens his eyes doesnt know where he is for a moment
they say youre alright
this is it then
the dark side
the price you pay for all the fun youre having
you knew about it of course
he was a friend of mine
a good guy
it was my fault
thats not what i hear
i was flying
thats what you get flight pay for
maybe i shouldnt take it
in surprise why
you act like you didnt know one day this would happen
not to me
you knew it
you all do
its part of it
maybe the most important part
charlies car pulls up
they get out and walk down toward the water
maverick seems dazed
she is softly taunting
where are we
where are we
you know where we are
its called the beach
its where life first crawled up out of the sea
i come here sometimes
when i feel like crawling back in
you dont have to do this
do what show you a good time
im not good company
i should be alone
i dont think so but if thats what you want
they stand there not making a move
what do you want
i want it back
she turns nods out past the moon
you look way out there
out past the date line
west becomes east all things change
you cross the line
today becomes yesterday
or tomorrow i forget which
thats what i want
of course the lines just imaginary
you can cross it twenty times
nothing really changes
she turns and walks along the surfline
on the beach
its what they say when navy men retire
hes on the beach
i always liked that
i had a picture
in my head
all these old guys wandering around here looking out into the past
he walks to the surf kicks the sand with his bare feet
if we knew then what we know now we might never have come up out of there
he turns to her
she just looks at him
you dont believe that
only when youre depressed
then it passes
immutable law of the universe
he picks up a piece of flotsam a twig worn smooth
you put as much life as you can between it and you
you start piling up experience between then and now
he turns and walks
what do you do when you come here
i play games
what kind of games
i like to play reality
she stops and turns
how do you play reality
its strip reality actually like what the pilots always want to play
this gets a small laugh strip reality
how do you play that
its like strip poker only without the bluffing
he laughs again one person says something and if the other one accepts that its true the one who says it gets to take one item of clothing off
she stops he goes on softer thats a pretty silly game
not as silly as some
you know the silliest one
that we are gods
that we control events on the beach
that we can turn back time
she moves in close
want to play the game
how does it go
you say the truth
dont be afraid
you want to win the game dontcha
the big one
the one thats most on your mind
a long pause
it comes hard
goose is dead
she nods true
take something off
off me or off you
thats up to you
he takes the ribbon from her hair
it falls down over her face and shoulders
now its her turn
what you do
she slowly loosens his tie and pulls it from around his neck
it was my fault
she says nothing stands looking into his eyes
he slowly as if in a trance takes her blouse off
you cant bring him back
she takes off his shirt
it was my fault
he starts to reach for her
she pulls back
already used that
she turns and thinks for a moment looking at the moon
your life goes on
rather than struggle his t shirt over his head she grabs it with both hands
she leans in close and bites it
she grabs both sides of the tear and slowly rips it off his body
what does it mean
shakes her head no that wasnt fair
it was a question
she drops her skirt
you didnt mean it
you didnt think
youd do anything to take it back
and thats one
she unbuckles his belt slowly slides it off
she unzips his pants they fall
she unbuckles it
you owe me one
he rests his head on her shoulder unhooks her bra
she shrugs it off
they stand on the beach in shorts and bikini bottom looking into each others eyes
looks like a tie
whos gonna win
well say it together
on the count of three
leaning in softer and harder
they both jump the gun
they embrace madly and sink to the sand
from the distance it looks like a strange slithering creature crawling back to the sea
the lights are out in gooses room at the bachelor officers quarters
the door opens and maverick enters
he sets a cardboard box on the bed
silently maverick gathers together gooses few personal possessions
he fills the box with clothes books a clock a radio a walkman and articles from the bathroom
he examines each closely like an artifact
as if he might find some message or meaning in them
he fumbles them into the box
he cant see too well his eyes are full of tears
maverick closes the box and carries it to the door
he takes one last glance around then leaves and closes the door behind him
carol and the kid stand staring at a silent tv
carol looks dazed lost
maverick walks in finds her
an awkward silence while they both try to think of something to say
maverick hands the box to carol
he sits staring right through us
the thousand yard stare
a strange white unreal light washes over him
the only color the navy and gold of the stripes on his shoulderboards
a low rumbling mumbling filters through the hiss of surf or fans or something
snatches of low whispered conversation
basic air safety principles
within performance parameters
even reckless at times
benefit of the doubt
mavericks eyes slowly focus
the light attenuates
the surrounding image becomes denser
things become real
a board of inquiry a commander and other navy officers seated behind tables at the front of the room
maverick faces them wearing dress whites
viper is also present
the commander looks at each of the officers
they each nod in turn indicating readiness
the commander turns to maverick and states for the record the board of inquiry finds that lt
evan mitchell was not at fault in the accident of twenty nine july
no response from maverick one way or the other
viper studies his face with concern
mitchells record will be cleared of this incident
still no response from maverick
mitchell is restored to flight status without further delay
these proceedings are closed
maverick doesnt respond
maverick lies on his bunk and stares at the ceiling
the phone next to his bed is ringing
it rings eight or nine times then stops
he makes no move to reach for it
omitted maverick sits in the cockpit staring at the controls while the ground crew preps the aircraft for flight
coogan helps him strap in
he speaks solicitously to maverick
it is unheard over the jet noise and radio babble
maverick looks at the cockpit as if its a strange territory suddenly foreign to him
he grabs the stick like its some peculiar talisman
he turns and looks aft
he seems surprised that it moves the control surfaces in the tails
maverick checks ten oclock low
he is disturbed
he tries to make the move but he is a man with no secret he is afraid
the bogey abruptly turns into him
then suddenly he jerks the stick hard right and takes the f away from the bogey at great speed
fungus is startled
jester walks up to viper who waits near an f
he just wont engage
he cant do it skipper
he cant get back on the horse
its only been a week
keep sending him up
ive seen this before
so have i
some guys never get it back
he walks off
omitted maverick grabs his stuff out of the locker throws them in a bag
he glances up as fungus enters continues to pack
what are you doing
saving them some paperwork
since when did you care about paperwork
maverick walks away
fungus hesitates then follows him
if i could fly like you id have everything i want
if i could fly at all
i cant fly
i cant fly like that
whatever it is youve got it
so youre scared so what
you ever get a good look at me in the back seat im goddamn terrified
grabbing the suitcase maverick brushes past jester and walks up the corridor
jester and fungus watch him go
fungus goes to the phone
charlie parks her car jumps out and runs toward the main entrance to the terminal
charlie hurries through the crowd bumping past people searching frantically for maverick in the huge terminal
she moves past bench after bench and her eyes flick in all directions
a quick glance at the souvenir shop the coffee shop and then she heads for the bar
maverick is there sitting alone in a booth with his suitcase beside him staring into a drink
charlie composes herself then walks to the booth and sits down across the table from him
maverick does not look pleased
never liked fighter pilots anyway
he looks up trying to be angry but he cant help it she makes him laugh
you came to the right place
the waitress comes up
maverickwhat are you having
turns to the waitress
ill have what hes having
hemlock is it
the waitress departs
he tries not to smile but cant help it
you werent gonna say goodbye
i was later
i wouldnt do that to you
id at least talk to you
i didnt want to see you
i mean i did
but i didnt
i know exactly what you mean
how could you
ive got a gift just like you do
my gift is i just know what people mean even if they cant say it
it helps when youre trying to communicate with fighter pilots
like what you just said was im embarrassed i feel ive done something wrong that ive failed and i dont think i can live up to the expectations of a
wonderful interesting intelligent woman like yourself
that about it
laughs something like that
and im gonna sneak off and be by myself for awhile like until i can think of a new career
hotel management or something
big talk for someone whos never been shot off her computer
hey i never said i was a fighter pilot
i never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm
i can find contentment in a good book
i dont have to roar by someone at mach two with my hair on fire
i just get happy being with the right man
i hope you find him
i think i have
i could be wrong
i have been before
just remember one thing
if youre not top gun if youre not fighting jets youre not gonna be able to act like a fighter pilot
youre gonna have to act like the rest of us
youre gonna have to master humility
for you guys thats the toughest maneuver of all
she gets up
lays a bill out for the drinks
so long sailor
see you on the beach sometime
she swings away
her wake sucks in the stares of every man in the place
then they look over to maverick quick flicks of envy in their eyes
he stares them back and cant quite meet their eyes
viper is tugged down the beach by a three year old kid
they come across one creature whos had a bad night
viper spots him he spots viper and viper moves toward him
tim vipers kid wants to head for the sea and pulls his father in that direction
he stops puts his hand on his hips like hes seen the pilots do
of all the aminals in the ocean which ones the baddest
i dont know tim
youll have to ask them
viper turns to the creature maverick and shrugs
runs in the family
maverick stands up
skipper sorry to bother you
i called your house
my wifes house
she said you took your kid to the each
every second sunday
zoo or beach or the ballgame
yhave the option
maverick thinks for a beat
segues to the question
what about me
viper turns they stroll together
we can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except cnc course not completed no explanation required
theoretically it doesnt hurt your career but people always wonder about things like that
or you can quit
i dont know
i didnt know either
thats why i told jester to prepare your papers
maverick looks irritated
viper stops at an icecream vendor and orders three with a gesture
youve already made up your mind
its no disgrace kid
that spin was hell
it would wreck anyones confidence
you could be a good pilot again someday
starts to get his back up you think i should quit
i didnt say that
thats up to you
but i have responsibility for the other guys up there not just you
they need to know youre all right
that they can depend on you
the vendor hands them icecream they take it
here let me get this
well be even
he reaches into his pocket for change comes out with a handful
slams it on the counter stars picking the proper change out
viper spots something and reaches for it
maverick sees and tries to block it but viper comes up with the navy cross
but viper recognizes it for what it is
sometimes its luck but in this case he earned it
i served with your old man
vf the oriskany
you remind me of him
youre just like he was only better
im nothing like him
you may not think so but you are
he was by the book all the way
they waved him off
he thought he knew better
he hit the ramp
i never heard that
not something they tell dependents
its not true
viper looks at him for a long beat throws his icecream away
why would i lie
he turns walks away
maverick stands there for a moment thinking then catches up to him stops him
struggles with the thought
as viper breaks in
you start on a wrong heading
the more you stick to it the further you get from your target
a good pilot always questions himself always questions his judgments stays alert for drift and makes the corrections
you may find a little discipline helps with the fear
you dont have to be alone up there
how can i go on
i feel so
kid the plain fact is
im not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass
technically they absolved you
you and i know what really happened
you pushed it
you are responsible and youll always carry that
you know what ill carry it too
i should have taken you out of that cockpit
i guess im a hopeless romantic
i always try to find something worthwhile in someones death
its no trade off
its not one for one
what you learned isnt worth his death
it couldnt be
but maybe there is some value in it
i know its the first thing ive ever seen thats really gotten to you
now the question is what will you do with it
if it gets you out of flight status
so you dont kill yourself or anybody else
thats one good thing
you were an accident waiting to happen
you think i shouldnt fly
i didnt say that
thats up to you
i think that if you do if you choose to come back youll be a better pilot
a better man
would you take me back
ill have to think about it
i dont know about them
i do know one thing weve got a lot invested in you
wed hate to lose it
even more than those other guys naval aviation needs a very few very good men
omitted loud rock and roll
the graduation ceremonies are in full swing
they consist of informal ribbing laughing and a lot of talking with the hands
every now and then the name goose comes up and a shadow passes across a face
for the most part they press on having a good time
fungus shrugs at someones question and looks around
i dont know where he is
what are his plans
i dont know
ice stands proudly holding the top gun plaque as others congratulate him
hollywood looks up as the door opens maverick is there
he looks uncomfortable unsure
he sees ice with the plaque
fungus moves over to him brings him in
good to see you man
one by one they come over shake his hand
viper stands there looking pleased but gruff
maverick walks over shakes his hand
the party starts to pick up
a real celebration now
jester enters a sheaf of messages in his hand
he takes viper aside for a word
viper nods at him
the groups attention gradually swings onto them
they quiet down instinctively
viper finally turns to them
gentlemen you know how i hate to break up this party before it has a chance to get really out of hand
more serious but theres a major flap on
were being called back
youre on your way
dont bother going to boq
your bags are packed
he hands them orders
someone turns the music back up
as they shake hands all around the music grows becomes purer as the background voices drop out
to include his helmet
stereo headphones from his walkman carry the same music from the party as he sits in the cockpit and stares at the grey water rushing under
he sits in his tomcat on ready alert
in the back fungus plays a hand computer game jet attack
mavericks tomcat sits waiting for a launch order on the forward catapult
he goes over the briefing in his mind
stingers voice breaks through the music
navy oceanographic ship
in full flight gear sixteen teams of fighter pilots and rios pay close attention to the squadron co stinger
by unknown forces
we dont know who they are
all i know is that its our ship and our orders are to escort it out of the area
stinger circles an area on the map
he studies his copy of the same map headings and vectors pencilled in
this is bullseye
a rescue operation is to begin within the hour
your mission is to give air support to that rescue
there are migs in the area and tensions are high
if you witness a hostile act you will return fire
we will be covering degrees of the compass by section
be prepared for anything
stinger is speaking to individual pilots
ice and hollywood sector two
he turns to maverick who stands nearby
youll back them up on ready five
a moments disappointment passes so fleetingly you hardly see it
as the aircrews file out tense but excited
their eyes search the horizon while slider and wolfman watch their instruments
the two jets streak across the sky
suddenly there are blips on the radar scope
two migs flying low to the deck
join together in a box formation begin to circle the area
we need some maverick sits in his tomcat on the catapult on ready alert listening to the message traffic
he gets a launch order turns to the lso
the lso salutes maverick salutes and flips him the bird
the lso drops to the deck
maverick is slammed back as the f is fired off the deck and rockets into the sky
filtered the two migs cross in a scissor pattern in their path
they join together again and fly level at ten thousand feet
one of the migs does a sudden canopy roll
suddenly out of nowhere hollywoods hit
just that fast hes hit and goes down
his f disappears into the clouds
ice puts his nose down and follows him
he comes out of clouds at nothing but empty water below
do you have them
did they get out or not
confusion no contact
i dont know
dive on those bastards
come on man engage
this is it
get your nose in there
maverick hesitates again
he sees the hornets nest below planes all over the sky
bandit at seven oclock low solo
pull on the goddamn stick man
dont tell me okay
maverick draws a breath then forces himself to pull the stick over
the f rolls in hard toward the battle
suddenly the cluster breaks apart
the migs break in every direction as maverick blasts through their formation
something comes up through the clouds
a mig blasts by
another rolls in and locks onto them
the migs swarm toward the tomcats coming from every direction
cannon fire erupts from one of the migs
the f s execute a left oblique turn in unison
they come down in a section attack with their cannons blazing
from mavericks cockpit everything looks choppy migs slide past at incredible speed
cannons blast as the planes scramble for position
out numbered four to two maverick and ice fight defensively
maverick has the angle on a mig when fungus spots a missile launch
maverick releases a flare as he takes the f into a hard left
the missile tracks the heat of the flare and sails out of the area missing the tomcat and falling toward the sea
maverick jerks his stick right and streaks toward ice
he cuts off one of the migs with cannon fire driving it down toward the deck
ice goes into vertical and comes around to gain an angle on the other mig
his rio is in position to check mavs rear
maverick turns to look and jerks a hard left
the mig is on him cannon blazing
ice yo yos inside and cuts the mig off
he fires a sidewinder
the mig turns hard the missile sails away
ices f is suddenly caught in a hail of cannon fire as a mig sweeps down from three oclock
he breaks dives
the jets streak across the sky low to the deck skimming the surface
mavericks f rollaways in and intercepts the bogey on ices tail
ice turns right the mig bugs and jerks into vertical
maverick swoops after him
maverick closes jerking left right twisting and turning staying on his tail
bullets fly by mavericks f from the mig on his six
he pulls a hard left then takes the plane straight up
we hear instructions shouted by fungus but it is all obscured in the sounds and fury of the battle
maverick peels over the top and comes down like a comet
a series of passes at the migs
as they come by one of the migs pulls up they look up
an mig is coming down belly to them close to a mid air collision
he pushes down
the mig roars by
the whole airplane goes booommmm its that close
the shock the air pressure slams them as it goes by missing by feet
maverick pulls back in sees a mig below
it takes off bugging out
ice goes after him
the mig maneuvers jerking hard left hard right twisting up down
ice is right in his shadow
they come in hard and low over the sea
he has the mig in the diamond
the mig starts turning
the missile goes by the tail
son of a bitch
then his tail comes off the airplane goes over a chute comes out
the mig explodes into a thousand small pieces
they roar by the mig pilot hanging in his straps
rolling down on him good sidewinder tone
the migs sense him they break one guy down low
he squeezes the trigger
the vapor trail comes off the mig turns like hes been bounced off a rubber wall comes around on the missile beats it
the missile flies by him
mig comes back turning into him
he looks back
millimeter tracers go by they just kind of float
he breaks hits airbrakes the trailing mig dives through
suddenly another mig appears rocketing straight for him
they close at knots vabooom
they pass nose to nose canopy to canopy
both planes pitch straight up trying for the altitude advantage
the f outclimbs the mig sitting on its tail full thruster it rockets straight up away from the planet
maverick has the advantage
suddenly his f runs out of energy
fungus is the first to call it
the plane backs down on itself backs into its own smoke as it flips over falls away
he catches it just regains control when
he looks up
second mig coming down
right on him
it fills the canopy
instinctive a push to miss him maverick breaks fast down into him a last ditch maneuver and the airplane departs
the roll rates and the pitch rates combine and it tumbles over the top the airplane just goes end over end
they are being slammed and rattled all over the cockpits
bone jarring neck snapping whips
shrieks and screams from the airframe
strangely calm goddamnit mav you really are a slow learner
dont worry fung ive got it
fungus is getting his teeth rattled
hes helpless he has no controls theres nothing he can do but hold on
youve got it
are you crazy
roger ive got it
the planes gyrations are rattling funguss helmet off the canopy
youve got it
cause for a minute there you had me worried
it yaws and rolls starts into a spin
now have you got it
have you still got it
rudders left sticks forward
passing ten thousand
ive got it hold on
lock your harness
i can recover
theyre in a progressive spiral nose low
the altimeter unwinds speed picks up
the g forces are forcing them away from the axis of spin jamming maverick against the instrument panel at the front of the cockpit
you with me
fungus also is jammed to his panel
right behind you
he is closer to the center of spin and less strongly held
it doesnt do much good however he cant control the plane
the only thing he can reach is the yellow and black loop the ejection handle
he reaches for it
speeds up to
funguss eyes are wide
the earth grows larger as it rises towards them
g forces flatten them
theyve long since lost the mig
nobody but an idiot would try to follow them in this maneuver
speed two hundred
the earth grows larger
fungus grabs the ejection handle with both hands
what are you talking about we gotta go
im not losing it again
the jet is standing on its nose gaining speed plunging towards the ocean
gotta go man
we gotta go man
feet we gotta go
im staying with it
im gonna go
then just as suddenly as hes about to pull
maverick catches it
the plane responds
theyre out of the spin
he gets control
fungus sits there dumbly hands on handle
still not believing
maverick stops the tumble pulls the nose up quickly and the f l sweeps into level flight no more than a hundred feet above the deck
he comes up and looks right at ice
ice is down low
he comes around a mig all over him like a cheap suit
a flick a whip and maverick in perfect position rolls right in on the mig
fungus looks like he just saw jesus
what in the christ
he looks at the mig target set up in front of him in awe
did you plan that
was all that something you planned
mavericks acquired the target and is all business
fungus is still lividly frazzled
if that was
next time you tell me first
maverick breaks down ice zooms up breaks in and takes the mig the other way
maverick yo yos in comes right up behind the mig as the mig starts acceleration
maverick rolls in on ice and the mig
the mig fires
ice breaks left drops flares
the migs missile follows the flares
the missile doesnt twitch
it flys right up the tail pipe of the mig the canopy flies off the pilot comes out of it and then the mig blows up we go right through
the fire ball
we got him
the mig rolls into the ground
they swoop by the pilot hanging in his straps
he watches them dumbly
what a dope
maybe theyll give him another plane
and we can shoot him down again
maverick and ice join up light it stand on their burners and blast straight for the sun
without warning a triple roll as the elation hits him
what is it
fungus nervously looks around at his circuit breakers
is there something i should know
is it the plane
the plane is fine
is it you
yeah i guess it is
we did it
we did it
we sure did it
he looks over at ice
were low on fuel ice
ice considers for a moment then responds
aw hell lets do it
youre not supposed to
but i have to
im right behind you
pri fly bridge primary flight control uss kitty the air boss speaks to maverick over the uhf
the admiral the xo and other officers watch and listen
filtered who is that guy
surpressing a grin likes to break at stead of knots
the air boss hates him
one time he came over the deck at two hundred shakes the shit out of the bridge
lifted johnson right off his feet
he glances over at ice who gives him thumbs up
the admiral looks out over the water and smiles
filtered the air boss is livid
he clenches the mike
just then the admiral pipes up
yes sir admiral
give him his flyby
the admiral looks at the others tries to surpress his own grin
he slides into his borrowed command chair looks into the wind
on the back of the chair a clue his name and rank radm
buford clancy boomer the air boss burns but has no choice
really pissed off sailors line the deck and search the sky
they crane their necks from their battle stations sweating into the sun watching for the approach of f s
someone sees it he points and shouts
the f appears and every man stands and we come screaming in feet over the water throwing up rooster tails behind
we split off and zoom along each side of the carrier at feet and roll it
it lifts the air boss right off his feet
the walls warp dust sifts from the overhead
the whole tower just goes boom
goddamn that guy
they break at knots
ice is first down over the ramp waved in
the f comes in a little rocky
it bounces hard but grabs the wire then jerks to a sudden halt
the sailors cheer and applaud throwing fists of victory into the air straining to get a look at ice as the crew directs his plane off to the side
opening the canopy ice and slider unstrap
stinger and the others are there
guys are climbing up climbing all over the airplane
theyre already painting a mig on the side and theyre looking at ice in awe
he catches the wire the view slams down toward the deck as the plane arrests then comes up
he releases the cockpit and can hear the roar of the crowd
he swings the nose around past ices
ices plane is covered in colored jerseys as the ground crew pulls him out
mavericks plane swings towards the pri fly bridge
pilots in flightsuits pour from the deck hatch applauding
as maverick and fungus climb down they see their wingmen on the deck
ice is looking in mavericks direction
his face is inscrutable
maverick gets mobbed but pushes over to ice
they stare at each other for a moment eye to eye even as they are buffeted by the crowd
finally ice breaks
i guess i owe you one
you dont owe me anything
were on the same team
you saved our lives
you did it
we did it
youre a hell of a flyer
he cant resist you can be my wingman any time
you can be mine
now ice laughs
nobodys ever gonna win on this one
but ice smiles at him
its now a running joke between them
whatever you say commander
he and slider snap to and proudly salute
maverick hesitates then returns it
as ice and slider snap it off it turns into the pilots salute they give them the bird
maverick and fungus laugh and return the compliment
as they are mobbed by sailors maverick is elated to see two familiar figures hollywood and wolfman turn from their battle damaged tomcat on the forward elevator as it sinks
out of sight below decks
what happened to you
he got our radio and an engine
we were lucky to make it back
stinger rushes up grabs ice and maverick in a bear hug
you name it boy
skys the limit
you name it
anything you want
what else is there
maverick grins turns away from them
he he looks out at the dying sun glinting over the sea
he thinks how beautiful it is out here
fungus grabs him from behind
you hear that
anything we want
what do you want
what do i want
what do you want
any more migs
stinger shakes his head no
they dont seem to want to come up anymore
theres nothing on the scopes
in fact everybodys denying the incident ever happened
what is it
what do you want
maverick turns away considering the options
another tomcat rolls up to park nearby
he looks at the plane
over the deck loudspeaker comes the final call to the f lso v
filtered a touch of sarcasm viper jester and others walk out of hangar to watch a wing return
suddenly an f breaks roars in over the field inverted a hundred feet off the ground
whos the hell is that
well hes in trouble and he didnt even get here yet
jester looks over at an admiral who steps out of a staff car squints up at the swooping plane turns barks an order to his driver jumps in the car
and slams the door the car takes off
mp jeeps lights flashing pull out and head for the flight line
they head for the hangar the jet breaks at knots and sets down neatly on the tarmac
the rest of his flight follows in perfect formation
he unbuckles his straps takes his helmet off
he looks over at the approaching caravan
i think they know were here
let me do the talking
you did the flying ill do the talking
he stands up in the cockpit gives a snappy salute
how really good it is to see you
maverick turns away
as he backs down the steps a jeep screeches up doors slam open footsteps
whos in charge here
hes answered automatically but now it hits him
he knows the voice
not for long you keep that up
he hops down stands there speechless grinning happily at her
you got your f you got top gun you got your migs
youre our new top gun instructor
ill think of something
what are you doing here
i live here remember
right on the flight line
hes got her on that one
everybodys got to be somewhere
maybe your somewheres with me
he puts his arms around her
self conscious she pulls away a little embarrassed to show this on the flight line
i always look forward to a challenge
now she laughs back and puts her arms around him
she kisses him and now she doesnt give a damn who sees it
