by paddy chayefsky under the credits the camera pans slowly across the project capturing the sober monotony the endless straight apartment houses
seven oclock in the morning
the bedroom of a two and a half room apartment in the housing project
it is early morning but the shades are drawn and the room is dark
camera moves slowly across the room over the large double bed on which charlie and helen samson a young couple in their late twenties are sleeping
they are sleeping more or less on their sides facing away from each other
one of helens pajama clad legs projects from under the light covers
we close in on charlies sleeping face
the alarm clock at a distant end of the room suddenly bursts into a soft relentless buzz
charlies eyes open
there is a muffled movement at his side and helen gets up on one elbow
then she sits up rises and pads barefooted a rather pretty girl in rumpled pajamas to the alarm clock and turns it off
charlies head turns on the pillow so that he can watch her
she pads back to the bed now and stands at the foot looking down at her husband
she produces a smile then turns and shuffles into the bathroom where she turns on the wall switch
a shaft of light now pours into the bedroom
charlie sits up in bed
his shoes and socks are on the floor by his feet
he reaches down and starts to put them on
suddenly from the recesses of the bathroom helens rather vague soprano lifts into the first lines of a popular song
then it stops as abruptly as it began
charlies head slowly turns to look at the bathroom back again to the business of putting on his socks
his face is expressionless but there is no mistaking the sodden distaste he has for the world today
he just sits on the bed a young man of twenty nine clad only in his pajama trousers one sock dangling from his hand his head hanging his shoulders slumped
behind him the sudden noise of rushing tap water then off
then his wife comes back into the bedroom
she is carrying a bath towel with which she is drying her face
finished she drops the towel on the bed and begins to dress
a moment later she pads around the corner of the bed to charlies front
she is still barefooted and wears her pajama top but she has exchanged the trousers for a half slip
charlie hasnt moved a muscle since the effort required to lift one sock from the floor
you think its too early to call my mother
i dont know
charlie shrugs without looking up
helen goes out of the bedroom into the little square of foyer where there is a telephone table with a telephone on it
she dials waits
in the bedroom charlie rubs his eyes with two fingers
on phone hello ma did i wake you up
this is helen
well ill be going to work and i wanted to get ahold of you before i left
i called you last night
where were you and pop anyway
i kept calling you every half hour up till one oclock
did you have a nice time
of charlie in bedroom
well listen ma i got something to tell you
of course im sure
ive got the report back from the laboratory
no you wouldnt know him doctor axelrod
he says i can expect the baby in february
well grandma act a little excited will you
you bet im excited
he is not excited
if anything he is miserable
his bowed head rises slowly
the eyes open
he stares abstractedly ahead for a moment
then he sighs a profound sigh of resignation
then his eyes close again and his head slowly sinks back to its previous abjection
helen dressed in skirt and blouse now is preparing two cups of instant coffee pouring hot water from the saucepan into the two cups
the toaster is ticking
a packaged loaf of white bread is open on the cupboard shelf
finished with pouring the water helen sets the saucepan back on the stove and comes out into the dining area
the dinette table is covered from end to end by open textbooks several very large accounting worksheets on which are scrawled meticulous numbers a ruler several pencils and a pen
an ash tray glutted with cigarettes a cup and saucer
calling to the bedroom do you need any of this or can i take them off the table
charlie appears in the bedroom doorway dressed and washed now a neat clean young man in a white shirt and neatly knotted tie
ill clean that up in a minute
he disappears back into the bedroom
helen picks up the ash tray and the cup and saucer
how late were you up last night
charlie standing by the window is picking up his keys a few dollar bills a comb etc
from a chair and putting them into his trouser pockets
the blinds of the bedroom window have been opened and the high august sun streams in whitening charlies face
after he has pocketed his odds and ends he moves to the chest of drawers on which among all sorts of other things there are several textbooks and an opened
he stands a moment looking down into the open notebook his lips moving ever so little as he commits some of his notes to memory
he turns a page of the notebook back to check something and then goes back to the previous page
now he opens one of the smaller drawers in the chest of drawers
the drawer contains wisps of his wifes stockings and other feminine things
he finds a small roll of bills and takes one of them putting the bill in his pocket and closing the dresser drawer
im taking five bucks from your drawer
he pauses now to affix a less frowning expression onto his face and goes out into the little foyer and into the dining area
helen is seated at the dinette table sipping coffee and reading yesterdays newspaper
there are two cups of coffee on the table
a guy in my office is getting married and i got clipped four bucks for his wedding present
he begins assembling the mass of papers and textbooks on the table
whos getting married
i told you about him
the guy with the sick mother
trying to decide whether he needs a certain worksheet the rest of the guys are giving him a bachelor party tonight
do you want to go charlie
i got class tonight
what have you got cost accounting
i think you ought to take off a night
you ought to go have a little fun for yourself
i think you need that
you go to work all day you go to school all night
you can miss one night charlie
no these bachelor parties get kind of wild sometimes
the whole philosophy is its the grooms last night of freedom
so it gets kind of wild sometimes
thats a good philosophy to start a marriage with
well a bunch of guys get together they like to tear up the town a little
he has assembled his notes and notebooks and texts in a pile on the table ready to take with him
he sits down and begins sipping his coffee
helen looks back to her newspaper frowning a little then looks up at charlie again
i think you oughta go charlie
i know youre upset about the baby
im not upset about the baby
come on charlie
i know how you feel
listen you dont have to pretend youre excited about the baby
we werent exactly planning on a baby right now
im not upset about the baby
its a shock
i had some bad days before i told you
i said oh boy thats all we need
then i said to myself if im having a baby im having a baby
thats all there is to it
and i like the idea
were going to have a family charlie
i like the idea
well give me a couple of days to get used to the idea
ill be all right
i know you will charlie
thats why i think you ought to go to this bachelor party tonight
bursting out i dont want to go to this bachelor party
he looks down at his coffee embarrassed at the outburst
im sorry i yelled
dont be silly
i better get going
kennys probably waiting for me now
im sorry i yelled like that
what are you sorry about
dont i yell at you all the time
we stay on helen as she reads her newspaper but there is a faint frown on her face
an express train hurtles southward
we see it flashing by through the concrete pillars of the subway
charlie and another young man named kenneth are seated in a crowded subway car
people are standing tightly in the aisles
kenneth is an amiable young man of thirty odd
he has his jacket off and his tie loosened as a concession to the august heat
charlie is neatly and coolly dressed
he has two notebooks and a battered text in his lap
he is reading the text
two young white collar workers on their way to work
they ride along silently for a moment
kenneth is rather stealthily concerned with a full busted young woman who is standing directly in front of him holding on to a strap
it is summertime and the girls all wear light summer frocks
there is a feeling of wistful sensuality to the scene
you going to arnolds bachelor party
i dont think so kennie
i got two classes tonight
yeah i was going to go but i think i better not because my kid the young one the girl shes been acting up again lately
shes got some kind of allergy the doctors dont know what
these bachelor parties get kind of wild sometimes
eddie watkins is making all the arrangements
hes probably got us lined up with a bunch of chorus girls
yeah do you think so
you know eddie
yeah boy he really lives it up dont he
did you see that blonde who picked him up for lunch last week
boy sometimes i wish i was a bachelor
well you know what i mean
i never seem to get out of the house any more you know what i mean
about once a week i go to the movies
we never even see the whole picture
my wife starts worrying about the kids
my youngest kid the girl shes got some kind of rash
we dont know what it is
i never seem to see anybody any more
do you know how long it is since ive seen willie duff
i havent seen willie in about six months
my wife cant stand his wife
you ever seen her willies wife
no i didnt know willie too well
boy waitll you have kids boy
youll never get out of the house
helens pregnant now
oh thats wonderful charlie thats wonderful
the two young husbands look down again at their hands and ride along silently
kenneth sneaks a quick look up at the girl standing in front of him and then lets his attention drift down the length of the car
hey theres a guy down there trying to pick up a girl down there
he is referring to a young fellow who elbowed his way down through the crowded aisle but who stopped abruptly when he noticed an attractive girl seated about three seats
down from kenneth
the girl is reading a newspaper
the young fellow stares at her
the girl aware of this sudden attention looks briefly up from her newspaper
the young fellow smiles pleasantly
the girl with a show of annoyance looks back to her newspaper
were you with us about eight years ago when i picked up that chick in front of the bus stop in paterson new jersey
when was this
yeah you were there
you were with that girl from brooklyn
we just came from palisades amusement park and we were driving frankie kleins girl home and the car broke down right in the middle of route one
beginning to laugh oh yeah
laughing and frankie opened up the hood and the water cap blew right up in the air
and the cop came over
thats right the cop
he thought frankie shot off a gun
they are both laughing audibly now at the memory
he was going to pull us all in
frankie he was funny
oh that was a lot of fun those days
yeah they were
the little spasm of laughter is over
a sort of ruefulness settles down on the two young husbands
kenneth looks lazily down the aisle to see how the young fellow is making out with the girl
he seems to be making out all right
they are looking steadily at each other now
kenneth turns back to charlie
hey this guys making out all right
shes giving him the eye now
charlie leans forward to see this progress
looking out the window at the passing local station where are we now prince street
i bet you he picks her up before we hit chambers street
somehow this has a sobering effect on the two young husbands
again they sit silently as the train buckets along
boy im bushed today
i was up till two oclock last night on this thing here
im getting to be a nervous wreck
i snarled at helen this morning
i think this whole night school business is getting me down
i dont see how you do it
neither do i
i thought i was through with it
the plan was for me to quit work and go to college full time and cram through in a year or so
but now we got this kid coming and helens going to have to quit her job and that sets me back where i started from
another five years of this summers included
i couldnt do it man ill tell you that
i wish i could but i couldnt
oh what am i griping about
this is the life i picked out for myself
but its a grind boy i tell you
they sit silently again
the train hurtles along and then suddenly slows as it approaches a stop
there is a rustle of movement among the passengers in the subway car
a few people start edging toward the doors
the girl reading the newspaper now folds her newspaper and stands almost directly in the young fellows face
they regard each other
to the girl excuse me can you tell me how to get to the nassau street exit
well at the top of the stairs youll see all the signs
are you getting off here
well ill follow you then
thatll be easier if you dont mind
no not at all
they start to crowd down the aisle
the train is chugging into the chambers street station and we can see the yellowed lights of the platform and the quick blur of faces
the two young husbands who had been following the byplay between the girl and the young fellow now watch them slowly exit
there is an expression of poignant wistfulness on both their faces
we look down on the bookkeeping department of a life insurance company in downtown manhattan area around pine street
it is a fairly large room large enough to hold eleven desks
but you get the feeling that this is one of the smaller offices on the floor
you get the feeling that this company occupies three or four floors of this building
despite the size of the office it has a cluttered look
each desk has piles of paper on it and all the impedimenta of the bookkeeper the pens and pencils the adding machine the telephone
some of the desks have typewriters
along the walls there are rows of filing cabinets and wall bins stocked with large worksheets and thick ledgers
at the far end of the room there is a row of windows but it is still necessary to keep the overhead fluorescent lights on all day
they are on now
there are two middle aged women standing murmuring to each other and a rather heavy set balding man in his late forties sitting at a desk in his shirt sleeves
already hard at work although it is still ten minutes shy of eight thirty
kenneth and charlie enter
ad lib hellos between them and the two middle aged women
charlie moves to the coat rack to hang up his jacket drops off his books on his desk starts for the coat rack
behind charlie we see kenneth carrying his jacket moving to his desk up where the middle aged man is working
walter the middle aged man nods his good mornings
poking in his desk drawer amiably walter what time do you come in in the mornings
youre making us all look lousy you know that
i get the feeling sometimes you stay here overnight
walter merely nods doesnt bother to look up from the work
kenneth finds a stick of gum in his drawer unwraps it
two more women gray haired and bespectacled come into the office
there is an ad lib mumble of hellos in background
charlie hangs up his jacket on the coat rack
arnold in yet
he starts his vacation today
hes getting married sunday you know
closeup of charlie looking out the window into the bright august morning
his face is just a little ruffled by a frown and there is a kind of pain in his eyes
behind him walter and kenneth
a nervous anxious man well the doctor was over last night
brought over the x rays brought over the allergy tests
brought over a bill for sixty eight dollars
i said to him doctor youre a young man professional highly educated four years of college two years of premedical training several years of interning of residency
if youre so smart how can you charge me sixty eight dollars
one thing they apparently didnt teach you in medical school
you cant get blood from a stone
so whats wrong with you walter
i have to go to arizona thats whats wrong
i have asthma
when i was a kid they called it hay fever and you carried a bag around your neck
now they call it asthma and you have to go to arizona
i said to him doctor youre a professional man four years of college premedical school bellevue several diplomas
answer me a question
whos going to pay for arizona
i said to him doctor i said perhaps you have the illusion i am the aga khan
i have a bearing about me perhaps that misleads you to believe i have blood ties with the whitneys and the rockefellers
this isnt true
did you ever hear of such nonsense
how serious is it walter
i have hay fever i sneeze a couple of times
the idiot told my wife i have to go to arizona and she wouldnt leave me alone all night
shes already packing the bags
i said for heavens sakes you listen to doctors well all be dead
my son harold believe me hes going to be a doctor
thats some racket boy
sixty eight dollars
closeup of charlie still at the window when a bell suddenly clangs indicating the start of the workday
the sudden jangle makes him start and he closes his eyes briefly against the noise
walter in background who had risen and was bent over kenneths desk darts nervously back to his own desk
you better get to work
hey charlie that was the bell
i think flaherty is here this morning
well all be fired today
i have a feeling
he hunches over his ledgers again his anxious harried face drawn into intense wrinkles of concentration
several other women have come into the office by now and there is a general movement to the desks
there is the click of a typewriter and walter runs his fingers glibly over the adding machine on his desk
the day has started
after a moment charlie turns from the window and comes back to his desk sinks down onto his chair
we look down on the bookkeeping department
all the desks are occupied but two
there are six women and our three men
the office is silent with industry everybodys head bent over his desk
there is the occasional punctuation of an adding machine or a typewriter or a phone ringing
our three men are bent over their tally sheets worksheets and ledgers occasionally reaching up to quickly tabulate something on the adding machine
after a moment walter says without looking up from his work you fellows going to arnolds party tonight
without looking up no im not going are you
eddie already hooked me for four bucks for arnolds present
this dinner is going to cost another couple of good dollars
it looks like nobodys going to arnolds bachelor party
you aint going
no im not going
eddies going to be mad
i told eddie last week i couldnt make it
ive got school
eddies a bachelor
its all right for him to go rooting around town picking up girls
yeah you get married you give that kind of thing up
yeah charlie says eddie has a whole bunch of chorus girls lined up for us tonight
walters head comes up for the first time
i didnt say that
i just said that if i knew eddie wed probably wind up with some of his crazy girl friends
walter looks back down to his work again
i dont know where he gets all these girls
hes a screwy looking jerk
did you see that blonde who was up here looking for him last week
he told me she was a television actress
i think i saw her once on studio one
she was in a coal mine with some stir crazy coalminer who was trying to strangle her with a necktie
id like to strangle her with a necktie
now walter an old married man like you with asthma and everything
walter looks up suddenly from his work a strange sting of pain crossing his face
i get real jealous of eddie sometimes
hes as free as a bird
did you see that convertible hes got
yeah he really banged it up i hear
you ought to see the old heap ive got
he walks out of here on payday he can spend the whole works on having himself a good time
i walk out of here and i got three kids and a wife all of them with their palms out
i lost two bucks playing poker at my house last week
it was an economic catastrophe
my wife didnt sleep all night
hes late again
hell be twenty minutes late again
if flaherty walked in now hed fire him
if that ever happened to me i think id kill myself
what does eddie care
so he scrambles around for another job
flaherty told me last week i had too many days off
i told him i was sick in bed
what do you want me to do
he turns back again to his work his face creased with anxiety
the three men work silently for a moment
then the office door opens and a man of about thirty five a little stout but rather casual in his dress wearing steel rimmed glasses enters
this is eddie watkins the office bachelor
he seems to have had very little sleep the night before
his eyes behind the wire rimmed glasses are heavy lidded
a cigarette dangles listlessly from his mouth
there is something of the bacchanalian libertine about eddie
there is a perfunctory exchange of hellos and good mornings establishing that this is eddie
he shuffles with ineffable weariness to his desk
hi eddie youre early today only twenty minutes late what happened
muttering through reluctant lips flaherty come in yet
eddie sits down at his desk pulls his cigarette automatically for a moment
then he reaches over to a pile of telephone directories on the floor beside his desk pulls up the manhattan one flips through the pages finding the number he wants
he picks up the phone
mary give me an outside line
he pauses checks the number in the phone book again dials waits hello is this leathercraft on madison avenue
this is mr
i was in about a week ago
i ordered a military set and a wallet
they were supposed to be ready yesterday

he is searching his pockets while he waits finds a piece of paper pulls it out yeah a military set and a wallet

the following inscriptions should be on them reads from the paper on the military set to arnold best wishes on your marriage from alice charlie eddie evelyn jeanette with two

now on the wallet
yeah thats right flaherty
now on the wallet the following inscription to my best friend arnold from his best man eddie
no to my best friend arnold
from his best man eddie
now can i come in at lunch and pick them up
a young woman comes into the office goes to walters desk and drops some papers before him
whats this jeanette
its from finance dont ask me
this is the girl in the office who goes to the water cooler three times a morning and all the men covertly watch her
she is cute but attractive more by comparison to the other women in the office
nevertheless all the men including eddie and charlie let their eyes cautiously watch her as she leaves her sheath dress tight on her hips
eddie who has hung up now rubs his eyes with two fingers to clear his head and picks up the phone again
on phone mary give me the hotel westmore
hands kennie paper this isnt for me its for you
to the others now who owes me on the presents
charlie you owe me

well there was about thirty people there and man you never saw such a crazy mess

camera pulls quickly up and away until we have an angle shot looking down at their desks in various positions of work
on phone louie make that five
five guys yeah a bachelor party
fade in with a big loud blare on eighth street in greenwich village on a warm august night
packed sidewalks jammed traffic taxis trucks buses honking of horns etc
man were going to have a ball type feeling
thirteenth street off sixth avenue not so blary and lit up as the main drags but traffic is heavy and there are lots of people on the sidewalks
there are a number of restaurants dotting the street with their little striped awnings and modest neons
if we are on our toes we notice one neon that reads louies
the entire interior isnt too much to show really
its a small restaurant but it is packed
waiters scurry here and there
people jammer and jab
hustle and bustle
in background we can pick out our bachelor party five men now clustered around a table yakking it up
wide shot of our bachelor party showing all five
they all seem to be in the best of spirits
the new member of the cast is arnold the groom a towheaded pleasant looking young man of thirty shy to the point of being noticeable
of all the men at the party he is the quietest
he sits a smile nailed onto his face turning his head from one friend to another as they talk enjoying the rare privilege of being liked
the dinner is over
during the ensuing scene a bus boy continues to remove the used dishes
several large bottles of beer and two fifths of scotch are on the table
there is a welter of variously assorted glasses
eddie walter and kenneth are smoking cigars charlie a cigarette
the groom is not smoking
we have cut into the scene during a jumble of conversation
walter is talking to charlie whose head is bent toward the older man
kenneth is trying to tell the groom a joke but the grooms attention is being distracted by eddie who is leaning across the table trying to get charlies attention
finishing story three hundred pounds
isnt she kind of fat
no man tall
to charlie so we were stationed right outside paris about eight miles a town called chatou
to charlie so the first night a whole bunch of us swiped a jeep out of the motor court
we had a feller there who was a tech sergeant in the motor court
oh what a character he was
he used to get loaded every night on that vanilla extract

hey charlie did i ever tell you about the time i was stationed at buckley field in denver and i picked up this girl in lakeside amusement park

hey waiter whos our waiter

the first night i was in hamburg two frauleins come walking right in the barracks
so i said to the lieutenant
walter who is pretty lit suddenly stands and bangs the table mightily with his fist
bellowing out the best fighting outfit in the whole fighting army was the fighting hundred and fourth infantry division general terry allen commanding
this brings the jumbled conversation to a halt
walter surveys the other four looking for possible challenges then sits heavily down
standing well now that we got that settled
im with you walter
we believe you walter
id like to make a little speech to our guest of honor and mutual friend arnold craig
arnold a bunch of us down the office the girls too all chipped in and we got you a couple of small gifts
eddie crosses to extra chair picks up wrapped gifts crosses back to his place
whispering to kenneth these are the gag gifts
lets see whats this one
arnold we figured louise might be very sleepy on your wedding night so we thought you might want something to keep you warm
walter leans forward to see what the tissue wrapped parcel arnold is now unwrapping is
what is it
what is it
arnold holds a hot water bottle aloft
walter is seized with a paroxysm of laughter at this immensely rabelaisian gift
its a hot water bottle
okay walter okay
hey did you see that
hey he bought him a hot water bottle for his wedding night
hey thats funny
hey eddie you should have bought him an ice pack for after tonight
holding a second parcel walter take it easy

crosses to arnold to the others this ought to be good
look at walter
walter has come around behind arnolds chair and can hardly wait to see what the next joke is
hey these are funny
who bought these

arnold unwraps the parcel holds out a miniature baby bottle
this is too much for walter how funny can you get
he clutches his sides

to charlie boy old walter is crocked
smiling rising halfway in his chair listen i want to thank you
i really want to thank you fellows

a hush falls over the assembled guests
arnold composes his face into a solemn expression and looks down at the cluttered table
solemnly well in all seriousness arnold seriously i dont know why you picked me to be your best man but i am deeply honored
i guess its because were both dodger fans and im going to miss you at next tuesdays night game when the pittsburgh pirates invade ebbets field
we always had a lot of fun together and seriously arnold in all seriousness good luck on your wedding but see if you cant get out of the house occasionally
see a night game or even a sunday doubleheader with your old buddy eddie
this touching address has brought a note of sadness to the gathering
indeed there are tears in walters and arnolds eyes
handing arnold two neatly wrapped packages well anyway in all seriousness here are a couple of presents from all of us in the office and good luck
arnold takes the presents stands head bowed
eddie sits and all faces turn to arnold

whats today thursday
kenneth and eddie all day
boy its here isnt it
i guess ive been running around so much the last couple of weeks i guess the wedding snuck up on me
i think arnolds having a little buck fever
does anyone know what our waiter looks like
to kenneth you know who didnt want to chip in for arnolds presents
arnoldll be all right
have a drink arnold
i had my basic training in camp croft south carolina near spartanburg
i was at maxwell field what a desert

what tech sergeant
walter youre crocked
to arnold open up the presents see what you got
hey are you our waiter
bring us some ice
i got him i got our waiter
it was sure nice of you fellows
the voices have risen again into the jumbled high spirits that opened the scene
hey man were having a ball
we look down on eighth street in greenwich village
it is eight thirty at night
it is a fairly active and well lit street bright with neons and movie marquees and lit up shops
our five carousers are marching down the sidewalk that is four of them are on the sidewalk
walter cant quite decide whether he wants to walk on the sidewalk or in the street
he keeps hopping in and out between the parked cars running to catch up when he falls behind
they are all feeling pretty good
arnold is singing in a wavering baritone de witt c l i n t o n boom
oh cli inton
ever to theeeee
closer shot of the five carousers
singing fairest of high schools
how did he ever get on this alma mater kick
singing give her three times three oh fellows
another shot of the five carousers walter whistling at two passing girls
long may we cherish thee faithful well be
clinton oh clinton for you and me
da da da da da
crash through that line of blue and send the backs around the end
there he goes with those fullbacks again
group shot of our five carousers paused on the curb waiting for the lights to change in their favor
greenwich avenue traffic is pretty heavy going in both directions
the five men are kind of strung out along the curb with charlie being the last in line
standing beside him also waiting for the light to change is a good looking well dressed chic young woman of twenty four or five
where we going
eddies place to see movies
boy just wait till you see these movies
hey charlie hey charlie
indicating the young woman whos your beautiful friend charlie
charlie turns and regards the pretty young woman
to the girl excuse me
my friend down there wants to know who you are
the young woman who for our own mysterious purposes we shall refer to as the existentialist regards the five reasonably tight young men all staring at her
kenneth has already begun to giggle
with a mona lisa smile where are you all from out of town
turning to the others isnt that right fellers
were from indiana right
kenneth and arnold to whom this incident is already unbearably funny have turned away and are clutching their sides trying to suppress a fit of giggles
to the existentialist were from the hoosier state maam
were from terre haute
to the existentialist were from terre haute and weve come to the big city looking for a good time and we just dont know what to do with ourselves maam
to walter look at that charlie operate
must be a convention in town
weve just come off the ranch there honey and were just raring
is that right men
are we raring
were raring boy were raring
beside himself with laughter hey charlie cut it out will you
the lights change and the existentialist starts off across greenwich avenue to the west side of the street
the five carousers follow right along after her
that is charlie dogs along behind the existentialist as they cross the street
walter and eddie are close behind him listening to charlies pitch
kenneth and arnold embarrassed and giggling stagger along behind
chugging along behind the existentialist were down here in greenwich village looking for some wild bohemians
do you happen to know any wild bohemians
all right fellows enoughs enough huh
she steps up to the sidewalk on the west side of greenwich avenue and hurries along down tenth street to a little house about four doors down the five carousers
on her heels like a pack of puppies
hurrying along after the existentialist im something of a poet myself maam
manys the long night in the bunkhouse where i sat by myself and wrote by the flickering light of a kerosene lamp
could i read you some of my poems maam
i know they aint much but theyre from the heart maam
the existentialist pauses in her hurried walk down tenth street to examine charlie with some interest
you have a sense of humor dont you
to charlie youre going great man dont stop now
the existentialist goes up the two little steps to the front door of the house and rings the bell
to the existentialist where are you going honey
the existentialist waits composed and patient for someone to answer her ring
charlie has wandered back to arnold and kenneth and the three of them are now suffused with laughter
kenneth has been laughing so much tears are coming out of his eyes
he walks around in little circles clutching his sides
several passersby hurry by noting the strange little group on the sidewalk
to the existentialist whats going on in there honey
patiently bored theres a party going on
im not sure im invited myself so i cant really invite you
sure you can
the door opens and a woman in a tea gown stands there looking at the existentialist and then at the five men on the sidewalk
behind her there is evidence of a party going on
how nice to see you darling
who are your friends
i havent the vaguest idea
i was ambushed crossing greenwich avenue by a tribe of the terre haute kiwanis
she waves a vague hand in a sort of shooing motion at the five men on the sidewalk go away you men
go back to the biltmore hotel and put on your red caps
i always thought you city people were more hospitable to us poor farm boys
the other four carousers are laughing too much to even talk
charlie has ambled up to the existentialist who is peering over her hostess into the room behind her
to the existentialist smiling amiably im sorry miss
a friend of ours is getting married here and were just horsing around
the existentialist looks into the young mans smiling rather winning face
why dont you come back after you get rid of your friends
hell be back
she turns abruptly and disappears past the hostess into the room
to charlie man she likes you man
now you boys go away
she backs into her house and closes the door
eddie starts up the steps to the door
the other four just roar with laughter clutch their sides and giggle and snort
well what do you say men are we going to this party or arent we
laughing come on eddie
i thought you had some movies you want to show us
what do you want to see movies for
you got the real thing right here
laughing eddie were married men here
come on lets crash this party
ive been to these greenwich village parties
man theyre wild
come on eddie lets go up to your place see these movies
coming reluctantly back to the others says to charlie man you were going strong with that girl
you could have scored
shes just waiting for you
go in after her
come on eddie
lets go see the movies
to the others all right i live about three blocks down
you guys want to see movies all right lets go see movies
eddie is scowling over a home style movie projector muttering over the intricacies of fitting a reel into the ratchets
arnold has suddenly become voluble and is gabbing away at him
camera dollies around them during the scene so that we can see into the living room of the apartment appointed in simple but neat masculine taste where the other three
men move in and out of view
right now we are concerned only with arnold and eddie
were moving in with her mother and father
i dont know if thats such a good idea
what do you think
we havent got an apartment yet and we figure well live a year with her folks save on the rent see
kenneth comes back from the kitchen with three open bottles of beer
anybody want a bottle of beer
to eddie shes a widow and that bothers me a little
i dont know why
shes two years older than me
i dont know if you know that
her husband got killed in korea
shes a cousin of mine you know
moving into the living room who wants a bottle of beer
ill take a bottle
yeah give me one
a third cousin something like that
its not good for cousins to marry is it
what do you think of her
i know shes not terribly pretty but i mean
muttering imprecations at the projector arnold leave me alone a minute will you
turns to the others in living room plants a huge smile on his face well im getting married sunday
having fun walter
a bunch of grown men sitting around waiting to look at college boy pictures
i swear i never thought two months ago i was ever going to get married
i still dont know how it happened
hey somebody turn off the lights
walter is promptly up to turn off the lights
hey you know youve got a nice place here
the room is abruptly flooded in darkness
a beam of light shoots out from the projector
it seems pointed at the window
arnold stands up directly in the shaft of light
i was just taking her out
i didnt know it was so serious
arnold get out of the way will you
arnold moves a step still in the shaft of light his shadow huge on the wall
eddie muttering jockeys the projector around trying to focus it on the screen
the square of light and some flickering images wander up and down a wall
were sitting in the car so she says well arnold weve been going together six months now
i think its time we decided whether we were being serious
hey eddie you got it on the window
i didnt know it was so serious
i didnt even know we were going together
i just took her out every now and then
arnold youre funny
turn on the lights again will you walter
whats the matter
i forgot to loop it over this loop thing
walter crosses to light switch
the room is flooded in light again
oh for crying out loud
small panic i cant even remember what she looks like
i just saw her this afternoon
arnold have a bottle of beer
its not so terrible
boy i tell you
its for the rest of your life when you get married
this is a big decision to make
does anybody seriously want to see these movies
eddie is furiously winding and unwinding spools
camera has dollied around so that we are looking back up the living room toward the projector and the men
i could be making a serious mistake
arnold youre in the way again
come on now
all right put off the lights
the room is flooded in darkness again
walter hurries to a chair
the square of light is reasonably focused just an edge trailing off onto the drapes of the window
numbers flicker quickly on on the screen
the rest of the scene we see looking into the whitened faces of the five men at their various posts
arnold crosses stands back of walter
here we go
hey arnold if this is the one i think it is theres one part here i want you to see
a picture of determined boredom but putting on his glasses this is for kids
says he putting on his glasses
the baseball game
thats a nice title dont you think
this is the one arnold
theres a guy in here who looks just like arnold
hey shes not bad
usually the girls in these things look like dinosaurs
his eyes glued to the screen a bunch of grown men
he breaks off as apparently some interesting action has started on screen
an involuntary grunt of acknowledgment escapes him
i got these pictures off my dentist
i dont know where be got them
there you are arnold thats you
yeah it does look like arnold
doesnt that look like arnold
whos looking at the guy
arnold youve got a great career ahead of you
that girl looks like the girl charlie picked up just before
that fellow there is not a bad actor
you could play that part pretty easy yourself
i think the daily news gave this one four stars
id like to see this in three d
the side comments drift off for a moment and a sort of frozen attention settles on the white faces
each face is sort of set in a mold of determined disinterest but the eyes are all watching
well ill just watch one of them
then i think ill just go home
he wets his lips lifts the bottle of beer to his mouth and takes a swallow
his eyes never leave the screen
helen standing in front of the laundry part of the sink doing her private laundry
she has on a house smock and her sleeves are rolled up
the doorbell rings
helen takes a towel off the doorknob behind her and wiping her hands comes down across the dining area to the front door
she opens the door to admit a young woman about eight years older than helen
i was beginning to think you werent coming
coming in i was at my mothers house
did they call you
they said they were going to call you
yeah your mother was very sweet
you should have seen my father
i said pa you have another grandchild coming
so he said who
so i said charlie
so he said that little helen
so i said if it isnt that little helen charlie better leave town
so out came the beer
well theyve been after charlie to have a baby for a long time now
i said pa leave him alone
let him get established before he saddles himself with a baby
anyway i want you to know joy reigns supreme in your in laws house
she moves into the kitchen hows charlie taking it
following her into the kitchen listen let me make you a cup of tea or something
no no ive been drinking beer for the last two hours celebrating your baby
soda anything like that
no honey you go on with your wash
is that what youre doing
she sits when i had my first baby mike was ashamed to be seen on the streets with me
well listen he was interning at the time
we needed a baby like a hole in the head
thats why hes a general practitioner now because of that baby
he was studying to be a surgeon
he absolutely refused to admit i was pregnant
even in my ninth month and i was as big as a house
he used to walk ten paces in front of me in the street like he didnt know who that woman with the belly was
where is charlie anyway
i told you he oh yeah
i wouldnt let my mike go on a bachelor party
turning back to her wash what are they going to do get a little drunk
are you kidding
what do you think these bachelor parties are for bachelors
this is for the married men
its a good excuse to get drunk and find some girls
can you picture charlie getting drunk and picking up a girl
charlies old sobersides
you should have seen what i went through to get him to make a pass at me
hes so sweet
nobody knows how really sweet he is hes so quiet all the time
my brother died in september he used to stay up with me till three four oclock every night
i used to cry all night and he used to sit on the bed and talk with me
i used to look at him talking there and i used to think what would i do without this sweet man here
id go crazy
you know you like to be a little cynical sometimes julie
waitll youve been married eleven years
you like to talk about all the affairs everybodys husband is having
do you know actually one woman whose husband is actually playing around
an abrupt sad expression tinged with pain has come over julies face
she looks down at the table
waitll youve been married eleven years
helen aware that she has perhaps touched on a sensitive subject frowns and turns back to her washing
a quick thick silence dips into the room
looking down waitll charlie gets to be forty two
my mikes having an affair right now with one of his patients right now
we dont talk about it dont you either not even to charlie
but mike knows i know about it
i even know the patient
a married woman with a hyperthyroid problem
my mikes a good doctor with a pretty good practice
the kids are crazy about him
but every now and then he has to go out and get involved with a woman
she looks down at her hands in her lap
listen i will take a cup of tea if youve got one
she stands opens the pantry looks around among the cans and packages for a box of tea bags
quite shocked youre kidding arent you
finds the box of tea bags would i kid about something like that
she puts the box of tea bags an the workshelf unhooks a saucepan hanging over the stove turns to the sink and fills it with water
helen regards her not quite knowing what to say
julie sets the saucepan going on the stove stares at it
i dont know why i told you
dont tell anybody not even charlie
i dont want the family to know
but this woman isnt the first one
i know that much
about three years ago the doorbell rings
i open the door
theres a man there
he says tell your husband to stay away from my sister
how would you like to open the door and have somebody say that to you
i cried for two weeks
i dont know what to do about it helen
should i bring it out in the open with mike or should i just keep my mouth shut like the other time
because hes not going to leave me
even if he doesnt care about me he has his kids to think about
we married too young
that was our big mistake
we married too young
her face her whole body suddenly tightens to forestall any possibility of breaking into tears and she sits down abruptly on the kitchen stool her eyes clenched tight and her
face rigidly impassive
helen remains nervously silent
her voice rising just a little from the suppressed emotion within her we should have waited till he finished his internship
what kind of married life is that
twenty two dollars a month he was earning
every other day he had to sleep in the hospital
the first two years of our marriage we didnt even see each other
and then im pregnant
he had to quit what do you think
he wanted to be a surgeon he wound up being a g
from that day he hated me
i had two other children by him but he hated me
he told me in just so many words
why do you think i kept telling you helen why do you think i kept telling you dont have a baby till charlie finds himself
suddenly cries out it hurts
even after eleven years it hurts
she stands abruptly and moves quickly past helen out the kitchen doorway into the dark living room leaving helen standing troubled concerned in the kitchen
after a moment helen moves to the kitchen doorway and a step out into the dining area
she looks through the dark living room to the gray silhouette of julie standing by the living room window her form lightly outlined by a tracing of moonlight
are you all right julie
muttering im all right
im all right
we are looking back up the living room as we were at the close of the last scene in this apartment
the room is absolutely dark now but a light pours in from the foyer
in this shaft of light we can see eddie moving from behind the projector to the wall switch and turning on the lights
the room is abruptly bright with light and our five men squint against the sudden glare
they have all changed their positions and taken off their jackets and loosened their ties
they are lolling about
camera looks down to the floor to take particular note of eight empty beer bottles an opened fifth of bourbon ash trays crumpled packs of cigarettes a cup and saucer
somebodys shoes somebodys jacket that has fallen off the back of a chair
over this we hear walters voice is that the last one
a thick silence fills the room
there is a kind of sodden feeling to this scene
after a long moment walters voice again ah youve seen one youve seen them all
yeah theyre all alike
i dont know i think the first one was all right
yeah i was so bored by the rest of them
i nearly fell asleep during the last one
you in the habit of sleeping with your eyes open
we look down on the room now at all five of the men eddie rewinding the last reel the little motor of the projector humming
the others loll about their legs dangling over the armrests of the soft chairs and sofas
there is a heavy dense mood that no one seems willing to break
what times it about anybody know
glancing at his watch i got a quarter to nine
no its later than that about a quarter after
again the silence falls upon the five men
only the humming little motor interrupts the thick silence
after a moment ah you see one youve seen them all
again the silence
charlie stretches over for his bottle of beer on the floor beside his chair
he pours whats left of the bottle into the glass standing beside it
otherwise nobody moves
after a moment so thats the last one youve got to show us eddie
you want to run them backwards
i wonder where they get the girls to make these movies
might as well go home i guess
the idea doesnt seem to propel anybody to any decisive movement
walter shifts his position on the sofa stretches out his legs regards his shoes with a sudden sadness
after a moment life is short
this gives everybody something to think about for a moment
hunched over the projector dismantling it you guys feel like going down to have a drink for arnold
this brings a reaction
what do you say
one last drink for arnold
okay with me
suddenly life is back in the room the men ad lib wheres my coat
lets get out of here etc
unwinding himself from his slouched position on a chair you can say what you want to about these pictures theyre really pretty bad but they get you
dont you think we ought to clean up the place
no i got a woman comes in
grabbing up his jacket i almost fell asleep during the last one
he looks at the others well what do you say huh
one last drink
ad libs on exit
helen and julie
a corner lamp in the living room is lit lending a soft but not too effective light to the room
the two young women are on the couch
helen sits curled at one end head down listening to julie who has been talking and probably crying a little since we last saw them forty five minutes ago
julie is seated with her legs stretched out in front of her her head resting back on the back of the couch
she is talking more freely and easily now the first hard outburst over with
hes a boy my mike
till the day he dies hell never be more than fifteen
perpetual adolescence thats the curse of the professional man
he spends his whole youth trying to be a doctor a lawyer an accountant
then he spends the rest of his life looking for the fun he should have had when he was a boy
oh i know
charlie and i hardly even see each other
its very hard on the wife helen
these are the years when you should be building your marriage
instead you grow away from each other
ive seen it happen with my friends
in the end they have nice homes in new rochelle and a maid and their maids are happier than they are
but sometimes it does work
it can be done helen
encourage charlie to stay with his school because
oh i will julie
hes an ambitious boy
oh its not just hes ambitious
and if he doesnt fulfill himself hell resent you and your baby the rest of his life
oh i dont want him to quit
he loves accounting julie
i see him sometimes sitting over his homework
hes got his ledgers out and hes adding up columns of figures as long as his arm
and hes chuckling
youd think he was reading the comics
he has a book there business law
how he can read it i dont know
but ill be watching television or something and hell come over and hell start telling me about some fine legal point
i dont know what hes talking about but its enough for me to see how excited it makes him
he loves it julie
you cant take something like that away from him
its just its just i feel were not really close any more
i mean he comes home from school lots of times im asleep already
and when i do see him he seems all involved with himself
he looks at me sometimes as if i were a stranger to him and i feel sometimes i am
im afraid of that julie
then get rid of the baby
it is said simply inevitably even innocently
it brings only a frown to helens face and a short silence
if i had it to do again believe me thats what i would do
slowly becoming aware of the depth of what they are talking about you dont mean that julie
yes i do
my children are the only things in my life now but i would rather have a husband
i wouldnt even think about it
thats what i said too
lets not even think about it
if i even mentioned it hed hed hit me i think
now the thick tense silence falls between them
they both occupy themselves with their own troubled thoughts
i want this baby julie
ive wanted this baby for a long time
its the only thing ive ever asked of charlie
if i mentioned that to him i dont know what hed do
again they sink into silence
then in the thick silence the telephone rings
the two young women are so deep within their thoughts that neither of them moves
it rings again and helen slides off the couch and goes to the phone
it rings again
she picks it up
on phone hello
hello charlie where are you calling from
you sound like youre having a nice time
oh youre having a ball huh
well what time do you think youll be coming home
charlie in the phone booth smiling broadly
he seems in wonderful spirits
through the glass of the phone booth we can see part of the bar and some of the barflies
on phone well thats what i wanted to call you about honey
i think a couple of the guys are cutting out now
i think kennies going home
but i was wondering if you wanted me home for any special reason
on phone just a minute charlie
she rises goes to kitchen door still holding the phone
to julie excuse me a minute julie
she goes into the kitchen
a little embarrassed she closes the kitchen door
on phone charlie
sits charlie come on home now
no i feel all right
i just miss you
julies here and we were talking about you and i just miss you
ah come on
frowns a little well no if youre having such a good time stay out and enjoy yourself
no charlie i dont want you to come home if youre having a good time
im not lonely
i was washing some things
i know thats what i told you this morning
youve finally got a night off for yourself
i dont want you to feel guilty about it
charlie do you love me
you sound angry
no come home any time you want
she wets her lips nervously charlie
she lets her head sink down onto the palm of her free hand charlie theres no girls at this party are there
im not checking up on you charlie
i just miss you thats all
all right charlie please i dont want to argue with you
julies in the living room
all right have a good time stay out as long as you want
all right charlie good bye
she slowly hangs up the receiver sits slumped and abject
charlie in booth
the broad grin has disappeared from his face
as seen through the closed glass doors of the booth he is a very sullen and despondent young man
he stands now pushes the doors open and comes out
camera pulls back so that we can see the whole area of the bar near the phone booths
next to the phone booth are two doors marked guys and dolls
kenneth is coming in from the deeper recesses of the bar where the other members of the bachelor party are grouped in a booth
he is headed for the door marked guys
charlie regards kenneth bleakly as he approaches
the party breaking up
pushing into the mens room i dont know
im going home
you going home
yeah i think so
he pushes into the mens room after kenneth
a small white tiled yet somehow not too clean mens room two urinal size
there is one washbowl with a small mirror over it and two water closets with doors separated from each other by a steel partition
charlie perches on the edge of the washbowl he apparently came in just to talk
kenneth moves off camera for more practical use of the room
camera stays on charlie who seems depressed pensive sad
stay on him for a long moment
frowning you love your wife kennie
off well ive been married six years
ive got two kids that keep me awake all night long
every sunday we go out driving in long island looking for a house thats going to take one probably two mortgages
i better love my wife
kenneth appears now edges charlie away from the wash basin so he can wash his hands
i dont feel like going home
are you going
hang around kennie
its only about nine thirty ten
its after ten
its about ten after ten
kenneth rips off a paper towel
the only noise for a moment is the soft crumpling of paper as kenneth dries his hands
the partys getting a little wild in there anyway
eddie and walter got poor arnold nailed in there theyre trying to talk him into getting a girl
this partys going to wind up in a joint let me tell you
this is a good time to blow
i should have gone to class tonight
im paying twenty bucks a credit
the least i can do is go to class
he breaks off abruptly turning away with a sudden frown
i take one night off i cant even enjoy myself
did you know eddie went back to europe
no i didnt know that
he was telling me he lived in paris for three months
id like to do that
he ambles around the mens room studying himself with unseeing eyes in the little mirror poking the trash can into which kenneth is now dropping his wadded paper towel
he suddenly turns to kenneth stares at him
kenneth looks at him in mirror
whats the matter
im going to quit
what am i killing myself for
quit night school
tonight was the first laughs ive had in years
i cant remember the last time i had so much fun
look what im missing
im making a pretty good living
i can support a wife and baby on what i make
im going to quit
i mean it
im going to quit
boy what a time to have a baby
you dont have to quit school because youre having a baby charlie
there are lots of guys go to night school with two three kids
you ought to meet some of these guys
theyre just grinding their lives away
its an obsession with some of these guys
i mean whats the point
so ill go five more years to night school
so ill get my degree
so ill get a job as a junior accountant for three years at seventy five bucks a week
im making better than that now
and then it just starts
the cpa exams
by the time im fifty i can start living
at this point i get a heart attack and an ulcer and they bury me in the ground and they say that was charlie samson the man who didnt see
a movie in fifty years
why go through all that
i feel so mad right now you better keep an eye on me kennie because im going to wind up punching somebody
the door opens
man enters to clean a spot off his tie
come on lets go home
what do i want to go home for
youre in a lousy mood
the man finished with his tie exits
after a moment charlie go home
i can see youre going to get fried tonight and wind up picking up a tramp and youre going to wake up in the morning feeling like two bits
itd be a profit
charlie about five years ago i went without a job for seven months
alice was carrying our first baby
we were living on money i borrowed from my brother
i dont know if you remember me in those days but it was rough
i used to go out every night put a load on and make a pass at any girl who looked at me
and i mean any
big tall short fat anything
well one night i picked up some tomato somewheres and we were sitting in a bar or somewheres and i kept calling her alice all night
so she says to me my name aint alice
so i said alice is my wife and i got up and i went home
charlie waits a moment for kenneth to continue but apparently this is all kenneth has to offer at the moment
what does that mean
i dont know
i had a point when i started telling that story
im not looking for another woman
yes you are charlie
you may not know it but you are
so go on home charlie before you get any drunker than you are
charlie you start messing with other women something goes
itll kill your marriage
itll kill your wife
itll just kill her
what my wife went through well i dont even want to remember it
its never the same with your wife again charlie
im not looking for any woman
i think what i was trying to say was you stick with your night school
some guys have to make peace with themselves that theyre never going to amount to too much
a guy like me
once i made that peace with myself i found out it doesnt really matter what you amount to
i got a nice wife and two children i complain about all the time but if anything ever happened to either one of them i think id die
but you dont have to make that kind of peace and youd be crazy to settle for less than what you want
you want something charlie
i think thats wonderful
charlies eyes go toward kenneth youre a little drunk now and youre fed up to the teeth
everybody gets fed up charlie
you stick with it
youre going to be all right
touched youre a nice guy kennie
youre a nice guy too
the door to the mens room opens and a young man comes in looks around quickly at kenneth and charlie bumps into kennie
watch it will you mac
charlie regards this statement a moment
then advances to the young man
wait a minute
what are you a wise guy
he is all set to bust the young man one in the nose but kenneth takes him by the arm
come on charlie lets go home
charlie allows himself to be led to the door
im just about drunk enough right now to bust somebody right in the nose
kenneth reaches for the knob of the door opens it and the two men go out
they find themselves in the crowded noisy bar
a jagged kind of intensity to the atmosphere as if some of the men at the bar might be gangsters
booths filled with men and women and some mixed up types
kenneth and charlie make their way through the bodies down to one of the booths where eddie and arnold are sitting and walter is standing heavily drunk
eddie is expostulating to walter to walter come on will you
look walter its just the shank of the evening

the little stretch of strip joints on third street
bright little cluster of honky tonks
our bachelor party now down to four carousers ambles along the rather filled sidewalk looking at the cardboard cutouts of the strippers in the windows of the night clubs
the four men pause before one of the strip joints examining the cardboard cutout and billboard which promises first rate entertainment inside
we look down on the whole night club showing the dark dingy crowded smallness of it
there is a strip going on
it doesnt look very interesting
our four men are huddled over a very small table in one of those third street clip joints
it is a dark little hovel but a blue stage light drifts across the table vaguely illuminating our four celebrators
behind them a strip tease is in progress
every now and then an almost stout woman in her forties garish in the blue spotlight dressed in a white satin ill fitting gown moves in and out of our
half the tables and wall booths are occupied
there is a horseshoe bar off in the recesses of the club
a three piece band is playing spiritlessly
walter is gone deep in some painful drunken world of his own
charlie rubs his eyes as if to keep his senses awake
arnold who is soggy is leaning toward eddie who alone of the four men is giving any attention to the show
so what do you think of my girl eddie
you met her
be honest with me
tell me the truth
i had the feeling you didnt like her
come on come on arnold
what do you want from me
arnold turns to charlie
listen charlie id like to ask you a little advice
i mean youre a married man
this girl im supposed to marry shes all right but im not really attracted to her you know what i mean
thats important isnt it
i kissed her a couple of times but i
i dont know why im getting married charlie
what did you say arnold
i said i dont know why im getting married
i did pretty good for thirty two years without getting married
i get along fine at home
my mothers a good cook
i have a nice life
what do i want to break it all up for
well arnold everybody feels that way before they get married
did i ever show you a picture of my girl
no you didnt arnold
do you want to see a picture
arnold clumsily hauls out his wallet and extracts a picture
he gives it to charlie who twists at an angle in order to get some light on it
i want you to give me your honest impression charlie
she isnt much is she
i cant see much in this light but she looks like a nice pretty girl
well i wouldnt say that
we were matched up you know
the families kind of agreed on it
i was brought over to her by my mother and father
thats how i met her
shes some kind of tenth cousin
shes all right
i kissed her a couple of times
she just sat there and i kissed her
i think she expected more
she even asked me that
she said to me are you afraid of me
i really dont go out with women much
dont tell nobody this charlie but you arent going to believe this but i never
i mean you wouldnt believe that a guy of my age i never
dont tell anybody i ever told you this but i never i mean charlie shes a widow
shes been married already shes going to expect a lot and i never what do you think i ought to do
what do you mean arnold
i mean you think i ought to marry her
well arnold even if i knew the girl i wouldnt answer that question
i may not like her but she may be fine for you
because im thinking of calling the whole thing off
its kind of late for that isnt it
im scared stiff charlie
what are you scared about
im not much of a talker and shes one of those quiet ones
what are you supposed to do with your wife
i mean most of the time
has to think most of the time arnold you dont even see her
youre away working
you come home she fixes you supper
then one of you washes the dishes
then if youre not tired you can go to the movies or visit somebody
or you watch teevee
i do that now with my mother
this gives charlie pause
scowling i dont know what there is to marriage
i suppose its to have kids
so what do you think i ought to do
you think i ought to go through with this marriage
angry arnold i cant answer that
he stands abruptly
our four amble along washington square north headed west
in the background the high apartment houses
it is about midnight now and there are a number of people around and there are lots of lights in the windows
there is still the feeling of life
however some of the wind has gone out of our bachelor party since we last saw them carousing on lexington avenue
now of course there are only four of them and there is somewhat a feeling of straggling about them
the four men straggle along tenth street east of seventh avenue
this is a dark little street
off at the intersection you can see seventh avenue and an occasional car moving downtown but west tenth street right now seems an empty sleeping street of dark and old
little apartment houses
the houses sometimes have little stoops
on one of the stoops there is a woman sitting
she is in her thirties not attractive nor unattractive
she wears a light summer frock and she has one shoe off and she is toying with the idea of pushing the other one off too
as the four men approach her she looks up half quizzically half questioningly
the four men note her in passing and seem to continue on but then come to a dragging halt about ten paces down
i think weve got one for you arnold
eddie looks back to the woman on the stoop
they all turn to look
actually charlie has ambled a few paces even further down and doesnt know quite why theyve stopped
they look at the woman the woman looks at them a little warily
rest of the scene from her point of view
ah come on eddie
she aint bad
calling from a few paces down whats the matter
weve got a live one
starting to walk come on lets go
arnold for petes sake
ah leave him alone
he doesnt want to
weve been walking around all night here are you a man or aint you
all right all right
with a scowl he assumes the responsibility of being a man
the four men charlie bringing up the rear move down toward the woman who now looks down at her feet and begins wiggling her bare foot back into the unused
not looking up i dont know who you fellows think i am but you fellows have the wrong idea about me
yeah i know
arnold see that bar down the corner
thats where well be
im afraid you fellows have the wrong idea about me
she says we have the wrong idea
ah leave him alone
you fellows are working under a misconception
eddie and walter have already started down the street to the bar
well be in the bar arnold
you all right arnold
yeah im all right its just
look im just sitting here fellows
did i say anything
i was just sitting here
you want to come with me charlie
charlie scowls at the suggestion but there is something pleading in arnolds face
you want me to
ill go up with you
from halfway down the street where you going charlie
ill go up with him
what the well all go with you
charlie waves him away
walks back to fellows well be down at the bar
arnold looks briefly at the woman and then away again
she turns and goes up the steps into the building her leather heels clicking on the stone steps
arnold head down and charlie a little sheepishly follow her
a dark ill lit hallway
a flight of stairs going up wooden railings worn carpeting
the woman starts up the stairs the two men following her
as she goes ssshhh
arnold wetting his lips nods
the woman reaches the first landing
the woman has come around to one of the three doors on the landing and is inserting a key into a lock
arnold and charlie appear now at the head of the stairway
the woman goes into her room leaving the door open
a moment later a shaft of light streams out into the landing
for a moment nothing happens
then arnold and charlie amble slowly down the landing to the open doorway and shaft of light
hey arnold you dont have to go through with this
i think i should
ill wait out here for you okay
arnold nods and goes into the room
he closes the door
charlie takes out a cigarette and lights it and inhales deeply
he feels a little sordid
there is the sound of steps muffled by the carpeting coming down the stairs
a man appears coming down from the floor above
he gives charlie a quick look and continues on down the landing to the stairs and down again
charlie scowls at the floor
he smokes his cigarette
it is a furnished room for which the woman pays eleven dollars a week
it is not particularly unkempt or tarty
there is a print slipcover on the soft chair and flowers on an end table
there is a studio couch with a neat spread and throw pillows on it
the woman stands expressionlessly in front of the old chest of drawers
she has kicked off one shoe and she is now kicking off the other
she starts to say something listen i dont want you to think i dont have a job
i got a job
she stops abruptly as arnold who is sitting eyes averted on a straight back wooden chair suddenly stands up and moves toward the door
whats the matter
arnolds lips open to form words but nothing comes out and he clamps his mouth tight and just stands miserable and wretched
his hand makes a nervous spasmodic involuntary gesture and he quickly clenches his fist
beads of sweat are on his forehead
are you afraid of me
arnolds head has started to shake nervously and he opens the door and steps out into the landing
the woman beginning to get angry follows him
charlie looks up at the opening of the door and arnolds entrance
the woman stands in the doorway
arnold moves quickly past charlie about halfway down the landing white faced and trembling
getting a little shrill whats the matter
hey you whats the matter
to the woman whats the trouble
i dont know
whats the matter
you whats the matter
go back inside
all right all right
how about that huh
she turns angrily goes back into her room ad libbing as she crosses and slams the door
charlie moves down the landing to arnold who looks at him wide eyed almost in terror
what happened arnold
i dont know
im just scared
yeah i dont blame you id be scared too like this
i dont know why we dragged you up here in the first place
its a barbaric custom
he has taken arnolds arm and would lead him down the stairs but arnold pauses again at the first step
dont tell eddie
no i wont arnold
why dont we just sit here for ten minutes or so
charlie frowns then shrugs
all right arnold
they both sit slowly on the steps
arnold is still trembling from the whole terrifying experience
dont ever tell anybody
its nothing to be ashamed of
i wont tell anybody
a mans voice suddenly calls down from an upper floor
anything wrong down there
calling back no
camera moves up closer to both men
the whole experience has depressed charlie and it shows on his face
camera pulls slowly back so that we get the small sordid feeling of the two men somewhat tight sitting on a dirty ill lit staircase outside a whores bedroom
neighborhood bar with about ten people in it
eddie and walter are two of them
eddie is playing on one of those bowling machines
he seems surly ill tempered restless
hey walter you know what we ought to do dont you
we ought to go to that party
remember that girl charlie picked up on tenth street
walter who is so drunk he is sober looks up at eddie with blurred eyes
im going to die do you know that
not tonight walter
tonight youre going to live
ah these things are fixed
crosses to bar im down to my last buck
got any money on you
he turns as the door to the bar opens and charlie and arnold come in
to charlie hey
to arnold howd it go lover
arnold smiles a mysterious smile pregnant with sensual meaning hey charlie lets go to this party
its only twelve oclock
oh these parties are mad man
all the women wear pajamas and all the men wear beards
everybody sits on the floor
arnold you got any money
i spent my last buck on those drinks
how about you charlie
assessing his assets i got a little over a buck
what are we all out
so lets go to this party then
punches charlies arm hey charlie come on
himself sullen and angry cut it out
you can have that girl you picked up on tenth street
all right you married men want to be so married thats all right with me
but id like to see some women tonight
punching charlies arm with more hostility than he knows come on
id like to see some women tonight you know
do you mind
cut it out eddie
you keep punching me i swear im going to belt you one
whats the matter with you
charlie is off his seat and ready to belt eddie one right on the spot
there is abruptly the imminent reality of a fist fight
the two men are just sullen enough
arnold hurriedly intercedes
all right all right fellows
look dont get so tough with me charlie
all right all right come on
angry i dont want to see any other women
just as angry all right
go on home
whos holding you
you want to call it a night
because im tired of grousing from one bar to another
you guys go home and ill go about my merry way
and dont get so tough with me
well dont poke me
turning charlie back to his seat come on lets go
for a moment the sudden thick hostility fills the silence in the room
nobody says anything
walter is soddenly preoccupied with his own thoughts
arnold is shaken from his recent experience with the woman and from the flaring of tempers
charlie just sits bleakly examining a book of matches he is toying with trying to bring his temper down
after a moment he mutters mutters you mess around with other women it kills your wife and it kills your marriage
eddie suddenly sulkily strides for the door of the bar
all right you guys go home and ill go on my merry way
gets to the door pauses then turns his sudden hot temper gone as quickly as it had come hey you guys you guys want to go to a nutty night
club look at the nuts
theres a nutty night club over on second avenue
you know what we can do
charlie you live in stuyvesant town dont you
you know what we can do
well take the crosstown

its right down on second avenue

eddie has started for the door already
charlie wearily gets off his stool starts to follow eddie out
walter takes his arm
charlie get walter
come on walter
closeup of walter im going to die you know what i mean
the sad little party files wearily out of the bar arnold pausing at the bar to pay for the drinks
long shot looking down through the length of one almost empty car through the open door at the end of the car down into the next almost empty car
just a few people riding the subway at this hour half past eleven on a week day
but down in the second car we can see our four cavaliers
eddie arnold and charlie are sitting
our attention is most caught by walter who is heavily drunk and weaves and lurches up and down the central aisle of the car
we cannot hear if he is saying anything
close shot walter weaving up and down the aisle of the car
he stumbles on the toes of a man in a windbreaker sitting in the car
mumbling excuse me
turns his blurred attention to charlie who alone of the three seems painfully interested in what walter is talking about so whatll i do
i mean he says im going to die
i mean the mans a specialist
he says go to arizona go to colorado he says
you got to get out of new york or youre going to die
he tells my wife the stupid idiot
my wife cried all night
im going to die you know that
you understand that
im going to die
you know what an asthma attack is like
your heart starts beating like a drum
i passed out the last time
deeply compassionate walter why dont you just quit the job and pack your bags and get out of here
walter stands in front of charlie his lips moving but no words coming out for a moment
there are tears in his eyes and all the pain and anguish of the mans forty eight years are clear on his face
getting the words out i cant quit
dont you understand
you dont understand
i cant quit
i got a fourteen year old girl i dont know what time she comes in at night any more
shes so wild these kids
i got a nineteen year old boy in college hes going to be a doctor if i have to die

what am i going to do out in arizona

charlie reaches up to steady walter who has worked himself up into a lurching fury
flinging charlies hand aside take your hand off me
you dont know nothing
youre just a kid
you dont know
ive seen death kid
ive seen it boy
i know what it looks like
he staggers away a few paces down the aisle stumbles over the mans toe again excuse me

what does it mean
what have i got
what did i make
who needs me
so this is it
a mans life nothing
worry about being sick worry about making money worry about your wife worry about your kids and youre on your way to the grave from the day youre born
the days drag on and the years fly by and so what
cries out to the whole world what is it all about
will you tell me
the train is slowing up for a station now
life is nothing
its a gag
its a joke
its a mortgage
its a bankrupt
its a lot of noise over nothing
sound and fury
isnt that what the man said
what do you think i never read a book
i read a book
i was a bright kid
everybody thought i was going to be the first catholic to be president
where did it all go
he turns to look at the station they are edging into the yellow lights the dark shadows the few blurred faces
his face is wet with the tiny rivulets left by tears
mumbling where did it all go
the train stops the green doors slide open
looking out in a low voice where are we third avenue
low voice where are we getting off
low voice yeah
a few people come into the car
walter stands shoulders hunched and sagging in front of the open doors
muttering im going home
looking up what did you say walter
im going home
walter steps out onto the platform
just in time because the doors are beginning to slide closed again
standing walter where are you going
on the platform walter has started to weave slowly up the platform toward the stairway
standing what did walter get out
calling through the open window walter stay there well come back on the next train
but walter has already reached the stairway and clinging to the handrail has started slowly climbing the steps
the train starts slowly up
arnold has stood now too
he is pretty soggy himself
poor walter huh
bellowing through the window walter
standing hell be all right charlie
god protects drunks and fools
the train is sweeping by the stairway now
charlie bellows out walter
grab a cab if youre going home
the train has swept by and in a moment they have been plunged into the tunnel of the subway the bleak dirty white walls and the small yellow lights flashing
charlie sits down somehow greatly shaken and disturbed
sits poor walter i didnt know he was so sick
i thought there was something wrong with him though
hes been out so much
sitting drunkenly down i didnt know he was so sick
close in on charlie
thats me in fifteen years
closeup of charlie
hold for a moment
we look down at the subway kiosk as our sad little party of three comes up the stairs to the sidewalk
it is midnight and the street is occasionally patrolled by a taxicab
the sidewalks are pretty empty just a few people walking
perhaps a drugstore is still open and its lonely lit store front catches the eye
our three men stand at the head of the stairs at the subway kiosk drained tired a little despondent
charlie looks up at the dim silhouettes of the endless apartment houses of stuyvesant town
thats where i live
in the back there
you cant see it from here
long shot of stuyvesant town as seen from their point of view
pan slowly across capturing the silent monotony of the dark buildings
only a few of the windows are still lit
it looks like a state hospital
it looks like a prison
yeah it does look a little like a prison
the three men just stand worn out tired
suddenly im going home
he starts to walk to the buildings across the little street that separates the corner of fourteenth street and first avenue from the parallel corner of the housing project
calling after him hey charlie
what about the money
have you got ten bucks
after a moment all right if you want to walk me to the house ill get you ten bucks
eddie has to take a moment to consider this
then he shuffles across the little street toward charlie
charlie doesnt quite wait for him to catch up when he turns and leads the way between two cars and up the sidewalk toward the promenade that leads to the
heart of the project
arnold after a moment follows eddie
the three men disappear single file into the darkness of stuyvesant town
we are looking at the twin elevator doors
the light of an elevator climbs into the little square window of one of the elevator doors
the door opens and charlie eddie and arnold shuffle out into the landing
they are all a little soggy
mutters ill be right out
he moves around the turn of the wall fishes in his pocket for the key to his apartment
he finds it brings it out opens the door carefully goes into his apartment
charlie comes in
the dining area is lit and there is the lamp lit in the living room
as charlie moves to the living room we can see that helen is seated on the couch watching television
the gray white light of the television set drifts out into the room
helen is in her pajamas and she has washed for bed her face is devoid of make up
she is half watching television the rest of her attention is devoted to cutting her fingernails and other aspects of manicure
she looks up as charlie comes into the living room smiles
hiya have a nice time
he is depressed and cant conceal it
im taking ten bucks
a couple of the guys are waiting outside
i promised them id loan them ten bucks
he stands by the couch now without interest automatically watching the television set
looking at the set tomorrows payday
ill get it back tomorrow
its in the drawer
a kind of ennui has engulfed him
he stands watching the television set out of which is now pouring the end of an animated cartoon commercial
then the familiar tinkling music sets in the inscription the late show appears on the screen and the announcers voice informs us that we are now going back to the
late show starring rex harrison in strictly dishonorable
the whole thing brings a wince of pain to charlies face and he turns and moves wearily through the little foyer into the darkened bedroom
enough light flows in from the other rooms to show charlie going to the drawer in the chest of drawers and taking out a ten dollar bill
he returns the other bills closes the drawer and just stands there suddenly so weak and exhausted that he has to steady himself with one hand on the chest of
back in the living room helen still sits a slight frown now indicating she is sensitive to the deeply depressed mood her husband is in
she continues with her nails for a moment
then wondering what is keeping her husband she stands and goes to the bedroom doorway and looks in
charlie is seated on the bed hunched in deep depression
he is holding the ten dollar bill
his eyes are open but there is a feeling of hurt and pain on his face
helen moves quietly into the bedroom and sits down on the bed beside him
whats the matter charlie
he shrugs even smiles briefly
i dont know
she puts out her hand as if to take his head and press it against her but he takes her in his arms almost desperately and they lie back on
the bed clutching each other their faces pressed against each other seeking some kind of strength just from the sheer physical closeness of each other
its not so bad charlie
they lie quietly even stiffly holding each other
eyes wide open but unseeing i dont know whats the matter with me i keep getting so depressed
im going to quit night school helen
my nerves are shot
he releases himself from his wifes embrace and sits up
those guys are waiting outside
i better give them their money
he stands and starts out the bedroom
maybe i shouldnt have the baby
what do you mean
she doesnt answer
she doesnt have to
they both know what she means
isnt that dangerous
well i dont know
well you brought it up
shocked after a moment you really dont want this baby
she turns away on the bed to hide the sudden flush of tears
youre my husband charlie
this is your baby too
that doesnt mean anything to you
for the first time in our marriage i feel i cant depend on you charlie im not important to you
she has to stop because she can no longer trust her voice
after a moment she continues i could make my life sound hard too charlie
i work all day i rush home i make you dinner
i sit home alone four nights a week im even alone when youre here because when do i see you
but it was easy for me because i loved you
do you think i care whether youre an accountant or a ditch digger or even out of work
all i ever wanted was you
and this baby because its you too
she closes her eyes again to hide the warm flow of tears in her eyes and stops talking rather than cry
charlie sits unmoved and wretched his shoulders hunched his head slumped forward
after a moment he turns and reaches forward quite frightened to touch her arm
dully leave me alone charlie
he stands and goes to the bedroom window and looks out
helen turns on her side so that her back is to him
at the sound of her moving charlie turns his head but sensing the rejection in her back he turns back and looks out the window again
the silence is thick between them
looking out the window i decided id quit school and
i dont care
i decided id quit school and come home in the evenings like everybody else and live a normal life
staring at the wall ahead of her i dont care what you do charlie
he stands another moment
i dont care what i do either
helen neither moves nor makes a response
charlie goes on into the living room and shuffles to the front door his long body heavy with pain and guilt and dense unknown terrors
he opens the door and goes out onto the landing
eddie and arnold looking up as the door opens and charlie comes out
what took you so long
what did you do blow open the safe
giving eddie the ten dollar bill here
taking it ill give it to you tomorrow
ill see you in the morning charlie
ill see you
eddie takes arnolds arm and guides him back around the turn of the wall to the elevators
charlie follows a few paces behind
eddie pushes both elevator buttons
charlie nods looks down at the tiling at his feet fairly sick within himself oppressed and guilty
the light in the elevator window shows and eddie opens the door
wait a minute
ill go with you
lets go to that party well have a ball
charlie shuffles the few paces forward and follows eddie and arnold into the elevator
the door closes and a moment later the light of the elevator cage disappears downward
this is one of those duplex apartments on west tenth street which consists of one huge living room that is two stories high and you need a little rolling stepladder
to reach the books on the upper shelves of the built in bookcases
there is a little wrought iron stairway that leads to the second floor which consists of two tiny little bedrooms
apartments like these as is the case in this one are usually lived in by two girls one of whom is a secretary in an advertising agency and the other
a model for a garment manufacturing firm
both girls are in their early thirties and are milling about somewhere in the mass of people in the living room carrying drinks laughing up a storm pausing at the
little knots of discussion groups with an apt phrase
they rather think of themselves as madame de staels with their own salon of bright young people for most of the men and women at the party are in some
way connected with the arts probably in an avant garde way
it is a little difficult to tell this by looking at them because avant garde artists have become obsessed with dressing like businessmen but if you can hear the talk
as we can you get the point fast enough
we pick up phrases like i really find it difficult to think of tennessee williams as a serious artist or my teacher thinks all tenors are frogs except gigli or
i dont see how you can say that his designs fairly throb with sex
there are as eddie predicted a number of people sitting on the floor mostly girls circled in the swirl of their ann fogarty dresses and there is one obvious ballerina
with her black hair pulled tightly back into a severe pony tail using the wrought iron railing that separates the dropped living room from the small entrance foyer to demonstrate something about positions at the dancing bar
there is someone at the piano banging away shouting his songs but he is completely inaudible five feet away
a few people lean over the piano apparently exhilarated by the songs
thin blankets of smoke wreathe their way up to the two story high ceiling
we catch some more phrases i thought truman capote was supposed to be here
trumans in russia i think
good heavens what can the russians want with truman capote
oh i never read anything published in this country
oh i mean the paper bound paris edition
in short this is a real chi chi wingding where all the furniture is too low and the hostess is very proud of the fact that her end table is
made out of an orange crate
somewhere through the jumble of the party we can hear the doorbell chime
a young woman at one of the little knots of people perks her ears and says im sure thats the police again
shes very proud of this
she turns and weaves her way through the crowded room carrying her drink
she goes up the step to the entrance foyer turns to her left picks her way over two middle aged men who are both throwing a pitch at a fairly
tight girl of eighteen past the kitchen which is a bedlam of ice cubes and kitchen towels and which is occupied at the moment by two intense women in their late thirties wrapped in deep discussion up past two young men who have no immediate use for girls to the front door of the apartment
she opens the door
group shot of eddie arnold and charlie from the hostesss point of view
not exactly a heartening sight to most hostesses three fairly loaded young men with their collars unbuttoned and their ties limp and dangling
beaming are you coming to complain about the noise
do we look like complainers
i dont know who you are but come in come in
i dont know half the people who are here tonight
they enter a little warily and ill at ease peering into the jammed room
the police have been here twice
the first fellow was just adorable
we gave him a drink and hes upstairs in a bedroom now for all i know
is that right
if you want something to drink youll just have to go into the kitchen and get it yourself
the place is just mad
do you write paint or sing
eddie spreads his arms in all inclusive expansiveness
but the hostess has already bent to chat with two women one old one young sitting on the floor
our three cavaliers look at each other and then look out over the wild jumbled room
boy do you get invited to a party like this or do you get committed
a passing young man who overhears this pokes his head into the group and says to charlie with a flashing smile i heard that
its awfully funny
charlie regards the smiling young chap
the chaps smile flashes off and he scurries away
eddie rubs his palms and surveys the women in the crowded room with a measuring eye
this is going to be like shooting ducks
pick out your duck men
wetting his lips he starts out for some girl he has decided on across the room
high shot showing progress of party still crowded still high
if we look sharp we can see charlie seated on the floor in the rear of the shot his back against the wall
closer shot of charlie sitting morosely back against the wall regarding his drink with sodden eyes
the chatter of the party an occasional shrill laugh
full shot of eddie coming out of the kitchen carrying two drinks
he picks his way through the people to the living room with the general intention of getting to the arrangement of divans around the coffee table when he spots charlie
and moves across to him
hey whats the matter charlie
squats down beside charlie without looking up lets get out of here eddie
the last time i saw you you was with that girl you picked up
shes over there talking to that old guy with the glasses
their point of view the existentialist on steps with landlord
i didnt like her
shes one of these real greenwich village phonies
if i added up all the guys she told me about she must have had her first boy friend when she was two years old
where are you going eddie
stick around a minute
who has stood im with that one over there not bad huh
i think shes a communist
i think shes trying to talk me into joining the party
how are you making out
not so hot
i may have to join
lets talk a bit
i better get back
shes liable to recruit somebody else
hes in the kitchen
i think hes out cold
ill see you
charlie nods as eddie moves off
he returns his morose attention back to his glass of liquor
then his eyes close and his face though impassive shows pain
after a moment he opens his eyes and slowly clambers to his feet and makes his way a little unsteadily through the living room in the direction of the kitchen
in the background we can hear the piano and somebody singing indistinguishable lyrics
charlie gets to the kitchen door and looks in
arnold is at the tiny kitchen table head on the table out cold
the kitchen is in a state of havoc
hey arnold you okay arnold
arnold makes no answer
charlie regards his prostrated friend expressionlessly for a moment
then turns and shuffles aimlessly back to the group around the piano in the living room
he looks over to the stairway again
the existentialist is alone now the landlord having gone for the moment
she is looking at charlie and he drops his eyes
he turns away from the piano and moves out a few steps into the middle of the living room
he moves to the stairway
the existentialist looks up at him as he approaches charlie kind of nods to her and for a moment she just sits and he just stands
that old man i was talking to before
thats my landlord
about ten thirty last night someone began pounding on my door
so i got up and opened the door and there was this white haired man with a pince nez standing there
i said what do you want
so he said im the landlord and i want the rent
well i just looked at him because the landlord i knew was a hungarian man named frank who was crazy about me and the issue of rent never came up
well it turned out that this man with the pince nez had just bought the building the day before and he kept grabbing my arm and saying he wanted the
well then i got the point of course
well meanwhile a boy named bob i knew had come over
hes engaged to a javanese girl with wonderful planes in her face who lives at the international house
but hes crazy about me and he drops in about twice a week
well meanwhile my new landlord was grabbing my arm and kept quoting poetry to me which he was trying to pass off as his own
he was an absolute fraud
he scotched the whole thing from baudelaire
you know that one
well he kept screaming about the rent i didnt like him you know and i called this boy named george who used to live in poughkeepsie when i was going
to vassar and hes crazy about me
he lives in st
lukes place now but he goes to poughkeepsie every wednesday to see his mother hes got an oedipus so that was out
well my new landlord kept telling me how much he was in love with me
i said how existentialist can you get
you just met me five minutes ago
he was absolutely crazy about me
charlie has been sort of half listening to all this
his attention if any at all has been vaguely given to the girls bare arms the lines of her body
resigned you have an apartment around here somewheres
looks up to second floor whats up there
what kind of rooms are up there
so i finally got to sleep around six thirty
charlie bends down to her takes her arm
come on lets go
wrenching her arm away no
oh stop trying to be so primitive
charlie straightens with an irritated sigh
i find you very unpleasant
he stands she sits in sullen silence
theres nothing upstairs
suddenly rises mumbles oh i dont care
she starts up the stairs charlie following close behind her
they pick their way past the other people sitting on the stairs to the second floor landing
they walk in hostile silence down the landing to the bedroom door which she opens
it is a tiny bedroom
the bed is covered with purses and summer stoles and other guest things
an uncovered improvised closet really a rack of hanging dresses and things gives the room an overburdened look
charlie comes into the room after her closes the door looks for the latch
she pushes some of the things on the bed aside and sits down and waits while charlie latches the door a matter of turning a bent nail into locking position
she begins to prattle again
so i finally got to sleep around six thirty this morning
at nine thirty someone began pounding on my door again
i got out of bed and opened the door and there was my landlord with the pince nez wearing a blue silk kimono
oh for heavens sakes i said what do you want now
he said im the landlord and i want the rent
i said youre an old man go to sleep
then the phone rang
it was a boy named andrew i know who teaches physics at columbia university and hes insanely jealous
hes married and has four children but he keeps badgering me to run away with him to nicaragua throw up his professorship and all that
well my landlord began shouting some garbled baudelaire at the top of his lungs and a little verlaine and a little huysmans
he apparently has some kind of fetish about french decadents
and naturally andrew heard him and he got furious and he said whos that i hear
i said thats the landlord
he said what does he want
i said he wants the rent
well at this point i felt like chucking the whole business and going back to bessemer city and going to work in my fathers hardware store
charlie has stood a moment listening to this bizarre story
then he has busied himself cleaning a place beside the existentialist on the bed
he brings an end to the rococo narration by putting his arms around the existentialist and in a moment she responds hungrily
closeup of charlie and the existentialist in a desperate embrace
muttering just say you love me
just say you love me
you dont have to mean it
he tries to kiss her again himself charged high at the moment but she turns her face away from him
the dialogue is intense whispered hungry
whats the matter
say you love me
say you love me
i love you
i love you
content look maybe we ought to go someplace else
im having a very tricky thing going with my landlord and i dont want him to see us leaving together
so you know what you do
theres a bar down the street
you go out the door and turn to your right
you know the one i mean
yes i know
well you go there and ill be there as fast as i can
now wait for me now because i cant stand being alone at night
youll like me
im supposed to be very amusing
she turns abruptly and goes out the door
he stands for a moment and then follows
he stands on the upper landing watching her pick her way down the stairs into the living room
she looks quickly around the room apparently finds whom she is looking for and moves quickly to a little group of men one of whom is about sixty years old
with a thin elegance and a cruel face the landlord
he has several young men around him all rather frail ivy leagueish
she joins the group to the distaste of the young men and is immediately voluble and gesticulatory
after a moment charlie lets his eyes wander over the room apparently sees eddie
calling down hey eddie
apparently eddie doesnt hear him
charlie frowns and begins making his own way down the stairs to the living room
charlie moves down the stairs into the living room proper
he makes his way to eddie who is still sitting in the back of the room throwing an intense pitch at his girl talking quickly smiling gesturing
muttering eddie im cutting out
standing low voice wait a minute ill go with you
i dont want to take you away from your girl eddie
aah this one lives out in long island with her mother
what kind of communist is that
itll take me a half hour on the subway there and a half hour back
shrugs wheres arnold
still in the kitchen
i guess so
to the girl ill see you next time i get to long island
he starts off after charlie who is already wandering through the living room in the general direction of the kitchen looking about for arnold
they pass the existentialist en route
she is saying
this boy named charlie i never saw him before in my life has been clutching at me all evening
hes absolutely insane about me
charlie leans into the kitchen where arnold is awake now seated at the small kitchen table staring gauntly unseeingly at his fingers on the white porcelain topped table
there are two men one middle aged one young having a whispered chat over the sink
over charlies shoulder hey arnold come on
arnold stands obediently almost dumbly
he squeezes around the table his face soddenly expressionless to join eddie and charlie in the kitchen doorway
eddie is saying to charlie well it wasnt a bad party
we killed a couple of hours anyway
the three men push their way past three women in their thirties who are standing in the little hallway before the front door in earnest brow furrowed conversation with each
charlie opens the door and the three morose carousers go out into the dark street
the three carousers come out into the street
the door closes behind them
the night air is hot and muggy
they walk down the street toward the corner where only the light of the corner bar gives any indication of life
there is a newspaper on the sidewalk which eddie bends down to pick up and the three men straggle to a halt
eddie opens the paper to the sports pages and starts to read by the light of the street lamp
arnold moves a step to the lamp and leans against it
charlie stands in the middle of the sidewalk a melancholy pondering young man
the evening seems to have come to a dead halt
after a moment eddie starts walking again reading the paper as he does
the others slowly gather themselves and follow him
a wall clock reading twenty five minutes to three
camera pans down the wall
we are in the bar on the corner of tenth and sixth almost entirely empty except for charlie eddie arnold and the bartender
the three carousers are leaning wearily on the bar over their beers the only other person in the bar is a worn battered old veteran of the streets a woman
in her forties bespectacled who is perched on a bar stool at the far end of the bar gloomily reading a newspaper
camera moves down and in on charlie eddie and arnold
i mean you cant compare the two
this kid the yankees have in centerfield
are you trying to tell me hes a natural
whats he normally hit
musial led the national league in hitting six times
hes only having a fair year this year and hes still hitting
musial is an all time great
i guess so
stiff with liquor eddie eddie
so what do you think eddie
you think i ought to go through with this marriage
i dont know about you arnold but if it was me boy id be in china by now
back to charlie who have the yankees got on first
boy how they touted skowron
all right hes having a lucky year
continuing well i mean is there any argument
hodges is the best first baseman in both leagues
so eddie what do you think
you think i ought to marry her go to china or what
arnold if it bothers you so much call her up and tell her to forget the whole deal
back to charlie all right hodges is having a bad year but how about last year
he hit over
he only hit thirty five homers and he drove in over a hundred runs so eddie
get rid of her
youre driving me crazy
arnold lowers his head and he rises loses his precarious balance and moves backward a few lurching steps
continuing all right whos on second
we got charlie neal or gilliam for that matter and this isnt even counting jackie robinson head and shoulders even with a trick knee the best second baseman in both
leagues if theyd let him play there
we got three guys for petes sake who can outplay anybody the yankees put on second
arnold weaves slowly up the bar to the two phone booths at the far end of the counter
then walks out of shot
continuing ever see charlie neal go to his right
that yankee guy whats his name he cant go to his right
and dont forget neal gets a lot of bases on balls and once hes on the bases man it unnerves the pitcher
the bartender decides to take issue
whats brooklyn going to do for pitching
never heard of newcombe
never heard of erskine
what have you got to compare with ford kucks mcdermott turley mcdermott mcdermott hasnt pitched a full game since last year
the best relief pitcher in both leagues
whats the matter with eddie roebuck
how do you compare eddie roebuck with mcdermott
what are you a yankee fan
well drop dead
turns angrily back to charlie a yankee fan
there is a sudden bellow off
eddie and charlie slowly turn to look in arnolds direction
camera pans to see arnold from their point of view a wavering drunken young man standing in front of the phone booths
i did it
you did what
arnold staggers a few paces into the center of the empty bar
i just woke her up
i called her
i said im not going to marry you
what do i want to marry you for
im having a ball
what am i going to marry you for
what is he talking about
then suddenly effortlessly arnold sinks down onto the floor out cold
for a moment eddie and charlie regard the prostrate form
boy hes gone
eddie and charlie move to arnold lying curled stiffly on the floor
i think hes just called his girl broke his engagement
is that what he was yelling about
trying to raise arnolds head wake up kid
help me get him up eddie
you think he did it because i was needling him there before
i was just needling him
the two men contrive to lift arnold and get him onto a stool
you better get him out of here because im closing up now
we better get him home
ah lets not break it up yet
i thought you were waiting for this girl
its three oclock in the morning for petes sake
take him out in the air
hell be all right
what a bachelor party
we start out celebrating the guys wedding we wind up breaking his engagement
moves to bar what do we owe you here
he puts some change on the counter eddie pay it will you
i gave you the ten bucks
following him to the bar what do you want to go home for
its going to take us an hour to get him home
he lives in queens somewheres
by the time i get back to fourteenth street itll be daybreak
what are you going to do stay up all night
dont you want to go home sometimes
what am i going to do home
i read all the papers
crosses to arnold well go to sleep then
ah dont go home charlie
i feel like doing something
charlie turns to him a cold fury in him
stand around this bar and argue about the yankees and the dodgers
wind up with some miserable lonely girl who begs you to say i love you
go home eddie
go to bed
you got to go home sometimes
ill take arnold home
come on arnold kid
im going to take you home
arnold manages with charlies arm to get out of the booth and stand
charlies firm arm holds him and they start for the exit
eddie watches the two figures making their way down the length of the bar to the door
the door shuts behind them
for a moment eddie regards the closed door
then he shuffles to the bar back to his schooner of beer and looks at it without taking it up
he is profoundly weary
his shoulders slump his face sags
he runs his hand down his face and shakes his head as if to clear it
he turns and looks down to the other end of the bar where the bar hag sits engrossed in her newspaper
he watches her for a moment
spiritlessly hey honey what are you a yankee fan or a dodger fan
the bar hag slowly turns to regard him over the rim of her glasses
bleakly eddie shuffles slowly down the long length of the bar to where the battered old woman sits
high angle shot looking down on the sidewalk immediately outside the bar arnold and charlie have just come out of
there is a house with a small stoop and arnold is standing slumped by the stoop holding himself up by the iron railing
he is being sick quietly retching
charlie is standing a few paces away from him in the middle of the sidewalk a deeply unhappy figure in his own right
from our angle we may or may not be able to tell that charlie is crying
close shot of charlie standing in the middle of the sidewalk of sixth avenue and tenth street the whole dark world around him silent and empty
he is crying quietly unashamedly his shoulders shaking ever so little
behind him arnold is bent over the railing of the stoop weak and spent
another shot of the two men
charlie stops crying sighs and starts toward arnold
gently are you all right arnold
arnold nods weakly
charlie gets out a handkerchief and gives it to arnold who begins to weakly clean his chin and spots on his suit
would you like to go back in and sit down
arnold shakes his head weakly no
what subway do you take arnold the bmt
can you make it
arnold nods weakly
charlie puts his arm supportively around his friends back but arnold makes no move yet being thoroughly drained
come on arnold ill take you home
there is a clicking of high heels on concrete pavement and charlie looks up
the existentialist has just come out of the party several houses down and has come up a few steps and is standing watching them
she has her bag and her light summer stole
she nods to charlie sort of smiles moves a few steps closer to them
is he all right
nods yeah hes all right
look ive got to take my friend home
the two men start slowly down the street to the corner
arnold leaning heavily on his friend
the existentialist stands watching them a moment
calling lightly are you coming back
where does he live
how long will you be
reverse shot charlie and arnold just about getting to the corner
charlie hasnt heard her
full shot of the existentialist watching them disappear around the corner
then she turns and wetting her lips she hurries back to the house where the party is
half past three and the car is absolutely empty except for charlie and arnold
arnold is sprawled across the straw seat one leg buckled beneath him the other on the floor
he is sleeping heavily
charlie sits expressionlessly obviously involved in deep introspection
the car buckets along into the night
arnold and charlie coming up to a landing
it is the third floor we can see enough of the corridor to see two apartment doors lettered d and c
a small overhead bulb provides a thin sketchy light
charlie and arnold shuffle down the landing to apartment d
they pause outside the door
the scene is played in low mutters and whispers
well thanks a lot charlie
you all right
yeah im all right
im a little groggy but im awake anyway
you dont want to come in do you
no i dont think so
i think my father and mother are up
i hear voices
my girl must have called them because they wouldnt be up at this hour
well you just go in and explain to them that you were drunk and youre sorry and youll call your girl the first thing in the morning because she must
really be upset about this
who has been listening at his door i think shes here
i think i hear her voice in there
well be nice to her arnold
remember you woke her up in the middle of the night and probably scared her to death
whatll i say to her charlie
i dont know arnold
what do you feel like saying to her
do you really love this girl
do you want to marry her
are you marrying this girl because your family wants you to marry her or why
i think i like her charlie
its just that im afraid i wont make a good husband
well tell her what you told me arnold
tell her youre scared and that you dont think youll make a good husband
if shes a halfway decent girl shell try to understand how you feel and if she loves you shes going to make it her job to make you happy
thats what love is arnold when you have somebody else in the world you want to be happy
my wife arnold i dont know what id do without her
arnold ive got a tough grind ahead of me
work all day ill go to night school at night
but my wife knows that i need this to be happy and she does everything she knows to help me
and weve got a baby coming
but if you love that baby and you love your wife then its easy
everything seems so easy to me now i dont know why i even thought of quitting
tears have welled in his eyes and he hurriedly puts his hand to his face shading his reddening eyes arnold i want my wife so much right now
i want her to be happy
i want to just go home and hold her and tell her how much she means to me
i mean even walter hes going to die but dont you think hell be in tomorrow morning same old walter jokes and laughs
hes got somebody to live for
hes even got somebody to die for
i mean how rich can a man be
and poor eddie i used to be so jealous of him
i used to think he was so free
free from what
from loving a woman from really wanting a woman
arnold what im trying to tell you is life is nothing if you dont love somebody but life is wonderful if you do love somebody
arnold i want my wife so much right now
arnold is a little embarrassed by his friends display of emotion and frankly hasnt understood a word charlie was talking about
im going to tell her about that woman tonight and everything
ill tell her about that woman
arnold i want to get home so much to my wife right now im going to bust
ill see you charlie
good bye arnold have a nice honeymoon
ill see you when you get back
ill see you charlie
but he is talking to an empty staircase
charlie has plunged down into the darkness of the floor below
arnold turns and sighs and shuffles back to the door of his apartment
he rings the bell lightly takes a deep breath
a moment and the door opens
a girl of about thirty five bespectacled rather plain with a sensitive face stands in the doorway
arnold stands his head down in shame
im very sorry honest
sure arnold i know
she looks anxiously over arnolds shoulder to see if anyone else is there
arnold lumbers past her into the apartment
voices both male and female pop out at him
whats the matter with you are you crazy
whats the matter with you
for heavens sakes where have you been
the door closes
long shot looking down the wide courtyard of stuyvesant town its endless little pathways winding from the various apartment house doors to the central pathway which leads to a stairway
to the street
it is half past five in the morning
the sky is gray and desolate
the courtyard and any other street we see is absolutely empty
the camera pans over this empty expanse to the stairway where charlie appears now coming quickly up the steps
he moves down the central sidewalk a little faster than he would usually walk you have the feeling he is exerting an effort to keep from running
camera pans with him as he hurries to one of the winding side lanes leading to a particular apartment house
medium shot looking from the foyer of the apartment across the dining area to the front door
the apartment is dark
the door opens and charlie comes in
he closes the door quietly after himself and moves a few steps into the apartment
he stops when he sees helen seated on the couch wearing a kimono over her pajamas
she stands she has been crying
i love you helen
she moves slowly to him and puts her head on his chest and cries quietly
he holds her tightly
crying softly i love you so much charlie
i love you so much
i love you
i love you charlie i love you charlie
i love you charlie
camera moves slowly up and away from the young couple holding each other closely and tightly murmuring to each other in the dark living room of a two and a
half room apartment in a housing project
