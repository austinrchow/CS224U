cam pulls back as more stars enter frame forming a starfield
a sensei once counseled a grief stricken boy as his older brother prepared to leave for battle
n stars begin to see a dozen or so stars almost forming a zig zagged line
cam continues to adjust
he said child why do you cry
you are both part of a family
and a family is a bond that cannot be broken by war
by force or neglect
n stars cam slows its truck out to a gradual stop as we see the pattern beginning to form
as if following the stars pattern the cam lowers as we find ourselves going into and more importantly you are brothers
and brothers you shall remain despite time
lower framing the tops of jungle moonlit and surrounded by mist
a mountain range peaks over the horizon
cam rests atop an old church roof
the peaceful scene is suddenly stopped by a machine gun burst
cam cranes over the roof revealing a relatively modern village
for a remote jungle
dawn is just barely beginning to break
the morning mist persists as we see four federales with machine guns surrounding a group of villagers
n ground a woman villager is thrown down
her son runs to her side
her son cries
up angle as we see the three federales greasy men holding ak s and looking down with hardened indifference
os we hear an evil chuckle
the men part as we see col
a bottom heavy disgusting pig of a man walks up between them
pantera leans down face to face with her
we appreciate the generous donation for the continued protection of your village
angle on their jeep overflowing with the villages precious crops
wider a tiny group of other villagers stand at a safe distance
the womans husband runs forward
he immediately lunges at pantera just as shika shika pantera is flanked by machine guns pointed at the husbands chest
pantera slothfully grins
he leans forward and yanks an heirloom necklace from her neck
after all the jungle can be a very dangerous place
they jump into the jeep and tear into the jungle laughing
the jeep clamors down the bumpy makeshift path
pantera sits in the passenger seat as the others are crammed in around the food
the jungle looms ominous around them
igh angle as we watch the jeep from the jungle ceiling high above
as if from someones pov
on driver he suddenly reacts to a fallen tree on the road ahead
slams on the brakes
pantera is thrown around
watch where youre going
theres a log on the road senor
quietly to himself that wasnt there an hour ago
well what are you waiting for
to soldiers behind cortez
cortez leaps out
grabs the winch from the front of the jeep and pulls it to the log roughly feet away
eep pov pantera and driver barely notice the out of focus bg cortez get suddenly yanked out of scene
on driver his eyes go wide
trying to see in the dark
softly nervous d d dios mio
on log cortez is gone
pantera wakes up
what is it
os hear the sound of a chain clinking
then whooshing as the chain winch suddenly flies in and cracks the burly soldier across the jaw
it wraps itself around his neck
before he can react
he gets pulled over the hood of the jeep landing on the ground hard
burly gets pulled backward
away from the jeep and into
he screams the entire way clawing the ground
on jeep driver is freaking out now
last soldier is in the back
pantera stands up in the jeep
last jumps out and readies his machine gun
to jungle the ghost of the jungle
shaking nervous the jungle god that punishes those who prey upon the weak
looks scared to pantera hes coming
os noise suddenly hear the whooshing of quick punches kicks a short machine gun burst and a whump
pantera and driver look to the ground
on ground last soldier lays beaten on the jungle floor
im sorry senor
driver bounds out of the jeep and runs screaming into the jungle
cam pulls back with him as pantera shrinks in bg
something suddenly skitters behind pantera
he turns to look
he reaches down and pulls up
on pantera he circles backs against the jungle wall trying to find him
suddenly a pair of white eyes open in the blackness behind him
n a quick series of shots we see pantera getting the raw end of a flurry of fist and foot attacks
his attacker is moving way too fast for the camera to keep up
pantera falls back panting heavily
he tears off into the dense jungle
on pantera running through jungle thick foliage
an oasis of calm violated by this sweating machete clutching brute
he stumbles then stands in the middle
i am not afraid of a myth
eyes darting actually
its turtle pal
pantera swings around
n attacker we pan up the thick green legs
muscular and strong
arms to match
it wears a shorn hooded poncho
inside are two white eyes and gritted smiling teeth
the poncho falls to the ground
on attacker its leonardo
beaten blue bandana blowing in the breeze
total hero shot
he pulls out a single katana sword poised for battle
panteras backed into a corner
lets see if a ghost can die then
pantera screams and runs to leo and starts swinging
at the clash of sword and machete we the boy is still at the village clearing
suddenly the sound of the jeep begins to rumble in the distance
the villagers panic and scatter
the jeep flies out of the jungle and bounce slows into the fg
only there is no one driving it
and it still has the stolen food in it
and the stolen medallion dangles from the rear view mirror
its a miracle
the village rejoices
the boy steps aside for a beat looks back at the jungle
something catches his eye
a small crouched figure on a tree branch
his white eyes lit in the darkness
one of them winks as the boy smiles
softly the ghost of the jungle
leo leaps into frame
he takes out his katanas and lays them carefully on the ground
he kneels head bowed eyes closed
my training is now complete
the camera lifts away from leo
and then plunges into the nearby cavern
music begins to swell
cam travels a few feet until it dips to black and comes up beginning our
the music is in full tilt as the camera travels through seemingly miles of underground pipes of all types and design
he camera comes to the end of line
it rises up through steam
then through a metal grate as we find ourselves in a mouse level shot of the spectacular city that never sleeps
its oddly hypnotic
a pair of sneakers land barely in front of the camera tearing off into the distance
shoes belong to a panicked mugger early s as three nypd officers clamor after him
the mugger is a jackrabbit hopping newspaper machines rolling under passing trucks and doing anything he can to avoid arrest
ventually the nypd peter out
the mugger looks back
on mugger his eyes suddenly go wide as vrooooom
we see a jet black tweaked out motorcycle fly over the cops heads aiming directly for mugger
the mugger runs but cant escape
the driver is dressed in all black motorcycle leathers and black visored helmet
scary and faceless
he quickly gains on the mugger and grabs him by the collar in mid stride
put me down man
but driver doesnt
instead he holds him lower without stopping the bike
and proceeds to plow muggers head into every trash can and garbage bin along th avenue
just as it looks like hell hit a telephone pole
driver veers left
he drags the mugger into
driver tosses him onto the ground at full speed
mugger slides down the alley and collides with a pile of garbage like hes a human bowling ball
on head of alley the driver guns the bike and kicks up a ton of dust and racket peeling donuts at mouth of the alley
and then he stops
dust slowly settles and smoke dissipates
wh wh what kinda freak are you
the driver gets off the bike
backlit by headlight
he walks directly to the mugger with purpose
mugger starts to really freak out
driver picks him up by the collar and slams him to the back wooden fence wall
p p please
dont kill me man
driver just cocks his head
mugger can see his own terrified reflection his drivers black visor
driver reaches behind his back and pulls out a combat knife
he reels back and
wh wha wha what are you doi aaagh
driver nails the dagger through the muggers jacket pinning him to the wall
driver turns around to gather the purses belongings at the mouth of the alley
fter he stops cringing the mugger wriggles the blade out of the wall
driver doesnt notice as thwip ip ip
he hurls the knife at the driver
it sticks in the drivers back
n mugger his grinning eyes suddenly go wide as driver slowly turns around unhurt
the mugger is trapped as driver moves toward him
and a bolo chain drops to his side
on wall shadow as we see a flurry of punches kicks and throws as driver lays a beating on the criminal who needs to be taught a lesson
an os police siren chirps
mouth of alley the police suddenly show up cherries flashing
they run to fg mouths drop
on mugger hung upside down by a chain
purse hangs from his neck
hell live but never commit another crime again
close on a newsstand headlines read woman mysteriously wider a quieter area of the city
broken by the squealing of the bike as driver nightwatcher roars in to a stop
nightwatcher drives underneath a train bridge
he takes off his helmet
red cloth spills out
he turns around as we see he reaches back and pulls out the knife from his shell
looks at it shaking his head and grinning
he sheathes it
nice try chump
quick shots ignites and revs engine
straps helmet back on
headlight comes to life
lets the clutch out
cam starts tight on bike as raphael tears away
close on a pair of turtle eyes
theyre wide with fear
nervously darting around unable to keep up with the surrounding danger
theyre all around me
what do i do
what do i do
mikeys eyes continue to panic
donatellos voice comes in over a radio
just relax mikey
remember your training
youll be fine
but i need back up this time man
youre such a prima donna
the cam pulls out of a large mascot head looks like a big goofy turtle head with googly eyes and dumb smile
wider we see a fake zipper spirit glued onto mikeys plastron
in his hands he holds two nerf styled nunchucks
from inside mascot head okay waita whoa whoa whoa whoa
suddenly ten kids with birthday hats and foam nunchucks run in screaming and start beating on mikey
a little too hard
take that turtle dork
end wider with the kids all walking away from mikey now on the floor doubled over from the playing
a beat then one more kid runs back and kicks mikey
turns and walks back this was the best birthday ever mommy
mikey groans as we beautiful downtown autumnal street
parked in front we see the cowabunga carl party van loudly decorated in kid friendly colors with an embarrassing and low tech looking turtle head on top
push in on upstairs apartment window
thanks so much
youre worth every penny
i have to tell all my friends about you
youll love their kids too
mascot mikey is standing at the door holding a fistful of cash still in full costume
i can only hope theyre as lovely as the rugrats you got here
on kids they look tough brandishing their nerf weapons a toddler street gang
one of the kids does a finger point then throat slit gesture
the mom looks and beams
the kids quickly smile to cover
through gritted teeth such
mikey looks to the side and sees the still piled high stack of pizza boxes through the fake head pov
everyone say good bye to cowabunga carl
put on voice hyuk
on door as the door closes and mom turns back a green hand reaches in quickly a grabs a box of pizza
the door closes
mikey opens the vans rear doors
he pulls off the fake zipper on his chest and then pulls off his fake turtle head
his trademark orange bandana spills out
he turns breathing in the fresh surface air
a quiet beat until a police siren approaches faint in the distance
mikey jumps in the van slams the door shut as the car whizzes by
wider the van takes off down the street
hey hey hey
dont forget the face thing
close on a regular motorist sitting in his car at a traffic light
don monitors from a small dashboard cam
man looks os left
off his look we see mikey beside him in the van
hes behind the wheel face frozen in a goofy smile like a ventriloquist to hide his identity
don follows on a small surveillance cam under the rearview mirror
thats a good boy
alls im saying donnie is that no one would notice if you did one of these gigs every now and again
but you add such
panache to the character
mikey emotional pops into fully animated facial mode
he rubs his sore neck
well if panache is french for punching bag id have to agree with ya
a darkened room lit only by the lights of dozens of tvs monitors and tv tubes
cables run everywhere
in front of them is donatello our resident tech head turtle
i uh oh on monitor don watches mikey through a traffic cam in front of the van
don is jacked into every major security and surveillance camera in the city
you got a peeping tom
on car the man is still looking only now really freaked out at the fully animated mikey head
mikey suddenly grips his face back into a tight smile frozen
he looks over and waves at the man who confusingly waves back
ventriloquist style just get me outta here dude
on don he hits some switches
traffics clear eastbound for two blocks
then hook up with route j
back with mikey hes still waving with a frozen smile
ventriloquist style righteous
mikey immediately unfreezes and sticks his tongue out and antics at the man
before the man can react mikey tears out and zips across traffic down a deserted side street
as we notice the annoying ice cream style music tinkering along with his gaining speed
you had to install the music too
all part of the cover my friend
the van parks in a long forgotten alleyway
a dummy gate closes behind it obscuring it from view
under the van we see its parked over a manhole cover
it slowly slides shut
the dripping concrete and metal maze explodes with the cacophony of mikey riding his skateboard backpack in tow
but this isnt just any half pipe it tests all of mikeys skills in ninjitsu extreme sports and cross training
he jumps on and off the board to occasionally tackle obstacles with all four limbs
a fun rock n roll sequence
feels like mikey is miles away from the surface world when he arrives at a seemingly dead end
he smiles as he reveals a brick dummy wall that brings him to
mikey lands in the foyer of sorts
atop entrance stairs
he kicks the double doors open
as mikey slides down the banister the cam dollies around behind him revealing the lair
breathtaking to fresh eyes
t has a wonderful lived in feel theyre not squatters
theyve made this their home
furniture is jury rigged and the place is custom lit to provide the right kind of atmosphere
if we looked behind the surface detail wed see a mesh of wires and circuitry powering the entire lair
donatello runs up to mikey
mikey robotically hands him the wad of money from the party
as donnie walks away mikey loudly clears his throat
don stops as mikey holds out his hand
dons busted he peels off a few bills and hands mikey his share
domo arigato dude
mikey walks into the room and plops down on a sofa
hits a remote as a big screen lights up in front of him
suddenly mikey springs from the couch
snaps to obedience
angle on splinter the japanese rodent master and father of the tmnt
he is well kempt still walks with a cane and has the same sparkle in his eye
he approaches mikey
a beat well
thinks then realizes oh
here ya go master splinter
mikey reaches into his bag and removes a foil wrapped piece of birthday cake
splinter lights up
butter creme frosting
donatello walks to splinter
holds his hand out judgmental
you remember your last cholesterol tests
but i changes attitude donatello
i am your master
nice try sensei
but you can still be my master
with low cholesterol
splinter surrenders the cake
as don walks away michaelangelo reaches into his bag and secretly passes splinter a smaller wrapped piece
you have done well my son
donatello walks to the fridge and opens it filled with dozens of other pieces of birthday cake leftovers
he tosses it with the rest
c the street noise below is barely audible
camera creeps along the edge of the building reaching a row of gargoyles
an along gargoyles still
just as we pass the fourth we barely notice its white eyes opening
quick snap back to gargoyle only now its gone
something strange is coming to town
lots of activity
push in on a steamer as a crane lowers a large vertical crate to the dock it thumps down hard
that isnt some box full of fish
cam lowers as april oneil leaps down into frame
dressed in jungle expedition gear with her head wrapped in a bandana
she takes off her sunglasses and admires the crate
on box labelled oneil cargo
something ominous about the crate
push in on it as april steps in front
admires it with pride
turns takes out a cell phone and hits speed dial
on phone display calling home
impatient mutter where are you
a spacious nyc loft tons of bookcases work as room dividers
piled with artifacts unopened crates of all sizes boxes of maps and a general organized mess
a hockey game blares from a tv set
cam pans across room the telephone continues to ring just as we reach the kitchen with piles of dirty dishes and fast food
and then a path of strewn clothes that gets messier and messier until we reach casey jones snoring on a sofa
he finally wakes up clamors for the phone tripping over mess in the process
talk to me
casey rubs his face tries to orient himself
looks at watch
was that today babe
same old casey
it was today that i returned to you after being in a deadly jungle for almost a month
i thought you were going to meet me down here
im sorry babe
i mustve forget it
ill take a cab
a long pause on the phone
casey knows hes busted
i missed you
april doesnt answer
she closes the phone
casey slumps in his chair shaking his head
good goin case
back at the dock april is back to business
get this on the truck for delivery
inside box see april through the wood slats
wed swear we almost hear
mikey is on his bed
his thumbs pound away at a video game on tv bored
he puts down the controller and yells to the ceiling
he stands up and walks to dons room
he opens it
it takes only one foot until the door is pushed up against piles of tech junk
mikey uses his shoulder and pushes it open
n don hes hunched over a work table back to mikey
tinkering as always
wild inventions line the walls some finished some not
some pay tribute to past tmnt adventures
don yever feel like you were meant for more
to do more
like i mean sometimes i feel like
michaelangelo contd like we never really left that glass turtle bowl when we were little dudes
reverse angle don lifts his head up eyes magnified in some bizarre head contraption
he flips up side panels electronica music blares out
oh hi mikey
you say something
sighs to himself every day its the same thing
birthday party gig
isnt it great
mikey sighs then walks back downstairs to the living room sofa
he and the camera think hes alone but before he knows it splinter is sitting next to him cross legged still and sipping tea
boredom is never an indicator of your surroundings
it is a reflection of your inner heart
fill yourself with excitement on the inside
and youll live the most rewarding life of all
mikey stares at splinter dead pan
then returns to flipping channels
he stops on a news program nyc dirt
and so yet again police officials are baffled at a crime of retribution that can only be attributed to the mysterious figure m known as the nightwatcher
ikey lights up
on tv is a flashy well coifed know nothing reporter
beside him is a news photo of the tied up mugger from our second scene
this is the latest in a string of vigilante acts that have been plaguing the city for the past year
nyc dirt reporter contd although the victims have been criminals themselves the nightwatchers actions have been identified as destructive and overly violent
verging on the edge of lethal
on mikey cant smile wide enough
he runs to his room returns with a polaroid camera
he snaps a picture of the tv
he pulls it out placing it in his nightwatcher scrapbook overflowing with paper clippings and articles on the vigilante
now thats what im talking about
cruising the streets busting those who hold themselves above the law
movie announcer voice but they arent above his
don walks in holding an in process invention
he looks up
mikey the mans practically a criminal himself
anyone who operates without boundary or rule of law cannot be legislated and needs to be reigned in
sounds like four turtles i used ta know
on door raphael walks in his nightwatcher costume no where in sight
whatta we talkin about boys
soundin a little too egghead fer my tastes
your brothers and i were just discussing the vigilante nightwatcher once again
beat concerned where have you been
youve been spending so much time away from home lately
raphaels on edge from the mention of nightwatcher already
his attention doesnt break from donatello
i joined a book a the month club
to donnie so just whats your beef with puttin dirtbags behind bars donnie
splinter watches the growing tension with concern
i have no problem with the incarceration of those who deserve it but if someone like nightwatcher has ultimate power
then who makes sure he doesnt cross the line
mikey picks up two ninja blade rings twirling them around aggressively in mock battle
i think hes cool
of course you would
in bg oblivious keeya
sometimes there are lines that even the police cant cross
someone has to be willing to do what needs to be done
and to do that fear becomes a weapon
you are such a neanderthal
raphael does the bully fake lunge at don
don reacts quick and startled eyes wide
i rest my case
if bullying is the only way to argue your point then perhaps you do not have much of a point to begin with
gritted teeth yes sensei
to mikey and quit touchin my stuff
raph yanks the ring blades out of mikeys hands and storms out of the room by flipping up a series of cables to the second floor
too late retort to raph that was just a startle response and isnt really an indication of fear
raph does the blah blah hand gesture from above
enters his room slams the door and immediately blasts music
and its some annoying pop hip hop song
then heavy rock starts playing to drown out his family
a silence sits in the room as a cd flies out of raphs room
tense in the room for a bit
don looks at the other two
its an involuntary thing your body does when stimulated like that
no response what
a large jet liner flies into the city
the wheels fold out under the carriages
closer leo is on the landing gear his face lit up by the city glow in front of him
he jumps off as foomp
a hang glider opens up from his backpack
he lowers the glider to the water and releases
out of the slime leo rises
inhales then smiles wide
home sweet home
all is peaceful in the lair
the big screen tv is the only light source
mikey snores and drools on the couch covered in junk food wrappers
donnie sleeps with an tech head magazine over his face
gadget in process in his lap
on entrance leo walks in and places his bag on the floor
the place feels different
but still feels like home
he tiptoes with ninjitsu precision across the floor avoiding the potential noise making mess below him
he sneaks to leo peers in cautiously
splinter is still awake
kneeling on the floor
leo walks in and kneels in front of splinter
i have completed my training master
i am prepared for the next stage
that you are my son
you must now apply all that you have learned on your lengthy journey to your everyday life
that will be the most challenging training of all
plinter reaches out and hands leonardo an ancient medallion
leo is touched
close on shadows outside of room we see a pair of eyes watching the entire scene
ive missed you leonardo
eo hugs splinter
ive missed you too father
im afraid much has changed in your brothers spirits since you have left
but now that you are home they will finally have the ethical and warrior leadership they have been lacking
the family needs you
on leo he swallows that big pill very hard
i mean yes sensei
to doorway raphael your brother is home
on outside of room raphael walks out of the shadows
but not too good for splinter
splinter and leo break and face the doorway
an awkward silence
raphael eyes leo
and then the medallion
awkward beat fake yawn well im goin to bed
tv room raph walks through the room cuffs don on the back of the head and keeps on walking
donatello wakes up looks around
lights up when he sees leo
on mikey he wakes up
a cheese doodle stuck to his upper snout
but i dont wanna pop out of the birthday cake mrs
ro snaps out of it mikey flips past donnie and slams leo with a gripping hug
and doesnt let go
hey little bro
a beat mikey
you can let go now
ver black quick bursts of audio violence
steel screaming trampling and rumbling
then with each audio burst we now see a visual burst
strong rim lit iconic images of an immense battle a slicing blade weapon screaming mouth angry eyes
then a monster claw
horns and tusks
the edit gets intense until it was all a nightmare
we go wider as we take in the ostentatious bedroom of maximilian winters a young mid s
famous nyc entrepreneur
inters is large handsome built and powerful in every sense
his bedroom reflects it as well large simple shapes decorated with a modern day tribal tech appeal
this guy is filled with adrenaline power and machismo
on doorway standing there is a beautiful black haired assistant dressed in full suit and tie with a clipboard
its time for your morning workout
rock hip hop music crashes in as we see winters morning workout a combination of weaponry work martial arts and others floor routines and bag work
he takes it all very seriously
sequence ends with him smashing the top off of a mook jung training block with his bare fist
he walks out of the room grabbing a towel from a blonde assistant
winters walks in his crisp suit
his office is large and austere
two levels of history in books artifacts warrior themed curios and power
on door his assistant stands at the large doors
the board is waiting
he walks to the large bay windows that overlooks the city
now outside the window he smiles at the view
tell them im on my way down
he slowly lowers out of frame
cam pulls out wider revealing winters office is an elevator of sorts that can ride up and down the front of the building allowing him access to any floor of
his tower without leaving his desk
wider see the tower is a monolith in the middle of manhattan complete with its own front central park ish gated entry
a true work of modern architecture
we see the wonder of everything winters mixing of old artifacts with modern day aesthetic and implementation
the ceilings are vast and there is no mistaking the worth of the man and his company
inters elevator office lowers into a balcony level building overseeing the main lobby
he walks down a stairwell and through the lobby five assistants following him
winters walks in the room
close on him as he stops at the head of the boardroom table
cam pulls back along the impossibly long table as dozens of board members stand up
when it reaches the end it looks as though winters stands at the head of an army at attention
leo walks along the upper floor of their lair
as he passes mikeys room his brother pops out with his skateboard
we follow them as they walk down to the tv area
whats up bro
just enjoying being home
hey walk past donnies chop shop room as boom
something explodes and smoke pours out under his door
mikey and leo cough leave the smokey area
say whats up with april and casey
i expected them to drop by after i got back
we dont see much of em anymore
april seems to be working a lot eww and casey seems to be i dunno different lately
maybe he doesnt like having to put the toilet seat down now that theyve moved in together
theyre living together now
they get to the living room area
mikey walks to the edge of a jury rigged half pipe he built in an old water slough
mikey continues as he skates back and forth
to be honest with ya theyre kinda buzzkills to be around
is casey at least still doing his hockey mask thing
havent noticed since the nightwatcher has come home to roost
that some new comic book youre hooked on mikey
raphael walks in
picks up mikeys scrapbook as he passes the sofa and slugs it in leos chest
this should explain most of it
the legacy of the citys newest hero
compliments of the fanboy over there
m joke all you want raphy
but train hard and eat your veggies and one day you too can be as cool as the nightwatcher dude
i can only hope mikey
i can only hope
leo disapprovingly flips through the book
this guy could bring heat on all of us if he keeps this up
showboating isnt a replacement for justice
its just self indulgence
looks back at book someone needs to talk to this thug
on raph he looks
dying to say something
close on a familiar looking white hockey mask
eyes blink behind it
wanna be goalie
the mask is pushed aside by casey kid was holding it
nah you know i work for a livin
its star center or nothin else
wider casey is with other kids prepping for a game of street hockey using tennis balls and trash cans
chubbier kid walks by and grabs the mask himself
lets get it on
they begin a boisterous round of hockey
trash talk gentle checking and all the requisite boy things
we see that the kids love casey
and vice versa
suddenly snapping back tommys defeated
looks at the disappointed boys
have fun with your mommy
face falls disappointed oh no
off his look we see april dressed stunning in a dark business suit at the other side of the street
shes dangling a white shirt and a tie from her other hand
aw cmon april
we just started
april just gives him the look with an eyebrow cock
casey knows he cant win
cant casey stay and play for just five more minutes miss oneil
not today nate
mister jones has to pretend to be an adult for a few hours
casey hands his stick then quickly turns with a grin
cam follows april and casey as they walk down the street
aprils not really a hard ass shes just forced to be the responsible one in a the relationship
i need your help with a delivery
arnold voice do you need my funtahstick muscles
casey awkwardly places his arm over her shoulder as the cam rests and they walk into the distance
he pulls it back down
cam angles on wall as we notice claw marks sliced into the concrete exterior of a building
the doors open in winters lobby
april struts in owning the place
casey struggles pulling the pallet holding the large crate behind them
as she passes reception mr
april oneil is here
his darkened office is especially alpha male big game hunt trophies adorn the walls as do suits of armor from all time periods and random strange artifacts spanning history in
winters sits at his large desk as the large doors open and april and casey spill in
you are a vision
thirty days in a jungle and beautiful as ever
he shakes her hand and double cheek kisses her
caseys eyes widen is this what his girlfriend does
this is my
friend casey jones
hows it going
winters nearly crushes caseys hand in his grip
actually its ca ignoring back to april so how was your trip
you know the typical corrupt government officials double crossed by a jungle guide all ending in a heart pounding chase
winters and april chuckle
cam adjusts to show casey between them in the bg looking uncomfortable and out of place
but it was all worth it
beat excited i found it
the fourth general
winters beams way too excited as well
april holds out her hand to casey who doesnt know what she wants
he awkwardly high fives her
the fourth general
hushed gritted teeth the crow bar
he hands it to april as she twirls up a crow bar and cracks open the front panel
inside box pov the light gradually breaks in until creak the front panel falls to the floor
close on winters look
pure wonder and admiration
he walks up to it slowly
april and casey cautiously stay back
the gods be praised
on box we finally see the statue general aguila a seven foot towering wall of granite and obsidian
eagle warrior armor reflecting a south american design
though not from a specific time period
winters rubs his hand over the stone
can i ask you a question
not looking away es
ive been so grateful for the opportunities youve given me lately
id probably be still selling antique curios if you hadnt visited my shop that day
off of box but i have to ask
why the fascination with these particular works of art
id never even heard of the legend of yaotl until we met
he looks up
the cam pans right
it travels past an suit of armor in the fg
goes to black
continue pan until were in the armor becomes the back of a helmet
camera dollies around the helmet until were looking at a dark and imposing figure
his helmet is impenetrable with eye slits
note the flashback is dark shadowed and monochromed
detail is hinted at instead of shown
it was a time long before the mayans april
long before the aztecs and even the olmecs
it was a time of legends
a time of greatness
the true mother culture of central america
cool shots of yaotl
his armor his stance etc
there was a man named yaotl
more a force of nature than man
and together with his four warrior priest generals they pillaged every culture in their path
quick shots of each general
the walk along side yoatl
possibly slo mo
we will come to recognize them through their distinct armor as the four stone generals in human form
and for every culture they destroyed they drank in all the magic and knowledge known to them
winters contd they became a warring hurricane gathering more power and knowledge with each conquest
group shot of five warriors
high atop a hillside finally stopped
ready for battle
their character specific weapons are drawn
around them is a small army of minions
then they came across a culture rich with science magic and their own technology
a south american version of atlantis
it was like blood in the water for a predator like yaotl
close on yaotl
as he raises his sword in the air
cam dollies around his head revealing their opposing forces
an army of thousands
waving their weapons in the air
the opposing army charges
yaotls men pull out a large ornamental stand a stargate of sorts
yaotl and his men are unmoving
as they begin a ceremony
yaotl looks to the heavens above as we see a cluster of specific stars move into place
as the army approached yaotl used the knowledge theyd gained in black magic and sorcery
timing their attack with the alignment of the stars of kikin they opened a portal to another world
on charging army they stop dead in their tracks
front lit by the os portal
dont know what to expect on portal a crackling electric circle opens to another dimension
suddenly dozens of monsters explode out
creatures of all varieties
they unleashed an army of monsters
n battlefield men getting slaughtered in a nice pg sort of way
the monsters knew no side they destroyed the enemy
as well as yaotls own army
men who swore to spill their blood for his cause
yaotl had to do something to stop more from coming through
inters smashes the portal stopping the slew of monsters from pouring out
end on a scream
dissolve to later in the battle
desolate destroyed battlefield
end pan on yaotl on his knees
in the end there were no victors
and they were responsible for the eradication of the greatest culture that will never be known
the knowledge that was lost would never be found again
casey has fallen asleep sitting to the side head in his hand
a line of drool hangs from his mouth
april is fascinated by the story
she nudges casey who does the slurp half snore wake up
wake up fast speak i was just resting my eyes
quite the story max
concerned re statue you dont think that this could be oh no miss oneil
looks back to statue like you said
just a story
inters doesnt break his stare
one of the girls will pay your fee on the way out
april and casey leave winters consumed with his new treasure
he doesnt reply
april and casey walk the lobby
she shoots him the look
it was a boring story
that is so perfectly casey jones
i give you opportunity
i give you the chance to become a better man
and what do you do with it
april contd casey stops next to a podium holding a priceless looking vase
as he speaks he gestures very animatedly and dangerously close to the vase
well maybe if you were home for more than four days at a time youd see that i dont want any of sees danger of vase casey you better be
careful here i am nice enough to help you out dress in this get up and all i get is grief
as he knocks and smashes the vase to the floor
klaxons sound as shink shink shink metal plates slam down room is now emergency light red
april rubs her temples
give me strength
winters is still alone in his office
still studying the statue
he turns his head to the side
you can come out now
ider as we see four figures appear out of the smallest and darkest of shadows
the leader slinks forward clearly a woman dressed in cloak and japanese noh mask over her face
he takes it off revealing karai the beautiful leader of the japanese foot clan flanked by three foot ninjas
your talents are commendable
as are yours
most dont notice us until we decide they will
well i guess im just special that way
winters walks over to his desk
the statue looms behind them
so down to business aside from the other reasons for your visit to america are you interested in my offer we discussed
i must confess
i still dont know exactly what we are to do for you
i need the finely tuned eyes and stealth of your foot ninja to
monitor the city for me over the next few days
winters walks to his window
overlooks the city
just keep your eyes peeled for anything
long beat what kind of strange things
the question hangs as we push in on statues face
his eerie eyes
we think his eye glows only we the glowing eye is really a star
the same line pattern we saw at movies open
the stars adjust
lining up in a more straight lined manner
cam lowers placing us back in a man walks down the sidewalk
as he passes a darkened alleyway he hears a low growl come from it
alley pov as the man looks in
cant see a thing
hand held cam
he moves to leave
and the growl comes again
street man stares in
no one on the street
grows more tense as
the requisite cat jumps out of the shadows
scares man half to death
calms down gave me a scare kitty
he pets the kitty a bit then walks off
cam lowers behind cat as man walks off into the distance
a large burly clawed arm slams out of the shadows onto the cat yanking it back into the alley
and then we hear a burp
am lowers further through the asphalt then quickly hooks up with an air duct pipe
zips faster and faster until were in leo feverishly works out
he stops looking up panting
does anybody train anymore
just a sec dude
im almost at level eighteen
os video game explosion scratch that
a few minutes leo
im in the middle of kzzzt booom
an os invention blows up
make that another hour
splinter walks by not stopping
a true leader knows how to motivate his troops regardless of their own motivations
splinter walks past a large fuse box
leo thinks a beat
wide shot of lair main room as kachunk
the entire room goes black
whats goin on
who ninja tag topside
another place that isnt the tmnt lair
dark and mysterious
dont know where we are
we see close up detail of statue granite
a deep voice chants os in a south american tongue as high tech gear is placed on the rock
it becomes powered triggering a reaction in the stone itself
music builds as we see quick shots of the granite cracks glowing red
camera travels with the rising glow
end on a pair of dead eyes suddenly come to life
the boys stand high atop the city below
readying to run a gauntlet of rooftop hazards
they spy a billboard off in the distance
m first one to touch old faithful over there does the other teams chores for a week
leo and raph glare at each other
im with leo
actually i think you and i should pair up mikey
you kiddin me
i mean no offense donnie but you aint exactly the biggest hitter on the bench
don is grinning
observing the subtle tension
just trust me on this one
music builds to a fun number as the two teams run parallel on buildings
the course requires them to work as a team throwing catching and propelling one another from obstacle to obstacle
leo accidentally slips plowing raph face first into a brick wall
raph convinced leo did it on purpose uses his next opportunity to hurl leo dangerously high and far over a billboard
the situation escalates at each juncture
have you been avoiding me
barely seen you since i got home
i been busy
youre definitely not upset at me or anything right
whyd you think that
i dont know
your brother gets to go on a world wide training mission and you have to stay home
might upset me too
are you trying to make me mad
im just saying id understand if you were upset
their intensity escalates
you wouldnt understand the first thing about me daddys boy oof
hey both trip over a duct tumbling in a ball
they stop rolling continue fighting
is that what this is about
you think splinter likes me best
youd love that wouldnt you
wider don and mikey are already sitting there
so nice of you to join us gentledudes
and by the way i prefer the classic military corner tuck for my bedsheets
ikey and don high five
leo and raph arent amused
they stare down
raph does his bully flinch fake lunge
only leo doesnt twitch
the others rush over to the edge with mikey
you dudes see that up there
off his look we see large shadows moving with in a large i beam construction site
the movement is coming from one of the higher floors
so what now captain
we need to come up with a plan
raph runs off toward the action
but raph doesnt stop
all three look at each other
then welcome home
the boys cross over on a large construction crane and scale up the few more stories to the top
they stand on a scaffold underneath the floor of the activity
on wall deep claw marks are carved into the steel much like by april and caseys loft
guys ive got a bad feeling
ahh lets take a tiny peek
they scale to the top floor
peering over the edge
well theres a good bad news scenario for ya
cam begins to crane up from turtles to activity on the floor
good news is that there are a buncha foot ninja gettin the snot kicked out of em
cam finishes on floor showing six foot ninjas and karai squaring off against a large bigfoot like monster
it tosses them around like stuffed animals
bad news is whats kickin the snot out of em
on turtles as theyve all now crept up to the dark corner of the floor
a foot ninja gets clobbered and sails past them and off the building
safely to a scaffold below an interesting conundrum
do we hold dear the value of life and help the foot regardless of our tumultuous past
i vote for sitting back and enjoying the show
to leo whaddaya say leader boy
on leo hes troubled
the burden of leader shouldered
we kick butt
raph jumps forward
leo rolls his eyes as all the turtles jump into the fray
the foot are surprised at first and the bigfoot monster is confused as well
on leo he stops when he comes face to face with karai
who are you
on karai she pauses a moment
they exchange expert katana attacks
she gestures to the foot as they use this opportunity for their escape
as they leap away karai looks back at the turtles
the creature immediately chases the boys throughout the structure as they use all their ninja skills to avoid it not to mention impalement on the bed of rebar below
aph tries to turn the tables and attacks the creature
the boys have no choice but to help him
putting them in deeper trouble
the i beam is getting dented and twisted with each impact
the tussle begins to fall whoomp whoomp down many flights of floors
raph gets separated at one point jumping off the side of the building to catch up and swings himself back onto the bottom floor to await the others
they fall into raphs floor
nice of yas ta join me
but the turtles eventually get cornered
and just as the creature closes in the creature stops
so are the other three turtles
i saw it on a nature show once
the creature screams back
boys freak out
ngle above turtles as a large teetering pallet filled with dried cement and blocks to come crashing down on them
the turtles are buried under the rubble
the creature is confused
until its hit with a blinding light and then an explosion fwoom
we hear heavy footsteps thumping through the light
shapes start to form until we see
living versions of the four stone generals
sporting high tech gear a mix of tech with ancient magic scrawlings
their bodies glow with a red inner life seeping through their stone cracks and piercing eyes
the generals are all animal themed mute and powerful ape themed costume mono eagle leader aguila agile jaguar gato and the deadly snake like female serpiente
completely bad ass
the creature roars and fights to no avail
buried pov silent
the turtles start to groan regaining consciousness
moonlight shoots in as they move the rock and stand up groggy
on mouth of alley through the smoke we can see silhouettes a large hairy shape along with four very large shapes
the sounds of freighter doors closing engines revving and then a caravan of sorts pulling away
a police siren chirps
approaching the now destroyed site
better hit the tunnels guys
donnie uses a small prod to prop open a manhole cover
don mike and leo jump in
leo looks back raph is still stewing
save it for another day
raph knows he has to go
reluctantly he enters the sewer
the lid closes as the alley is illuminated by police cherries
beat then mikey barely pops the lid open for another peek
yknow its not that bad dudes
on building actually the place is destroyed
dented torn and looking like a post night raid in wwii
up angle on the tower
dead of night
no one around
a cavernous structure
a few odd silhouettes here and there
we hear the clicking of winters shoes echo as he enters
what seems to be the problem
karai and six ninja are already there
the problem is that we were hired to merely patrol the city and report anything strange to you
karai contd grabs sword hilt you never said anything about winters smirks looking at the mouse who thinks he can take the lion
he reaches to a satchel on the floor
the foot tense in anticipation
winters comes up with a tosses money brick so your job duties were just redefined
congratulations on your promotion
karai pulls out her to and slices the brick in mid air
winters stops and looks back over his shoulder
we may be hired help to you but you should never forget
we are the foot clan
on winters condescendingly finds this particularly cute
it sets the foot off
they all grab their weapons moving toward winters
karai flips forward sword drawn and at winters throat
as winters stands still
and begins to laugh
slowly the thumping of four sets of feet lumber out of the shadows
reveal themselves to be the four stone generals
they flank winters who is just loving the theatricality of it all
the foot ninja leap back
winters remains confident and unmoving
generals smirk at karai and the foot
i believe we made a deal karai
i expect you to honor it
beat stares her down you do understand honor dont you
of course she does
so i dont care what part of muscle for hire you dont understand
i hired your muscle
now exercise the ones attached to your feet and
closer terse get back to work
karai slowly steps back
winters smiles wide reaches into the drawer and takes another brick of bills and tosses it to a foot ninja
then another to a second ninja
so i will double
triple your pay for your troubles
stare down are we cool
on foot they just stare back blank goggles
probably seething inside
winters is flanked by generals
the foot dont move
karai finally nods
no sense of humor
to generals so how did we fare
corridor entrance a hunched shape undulating in chains is wheeled into the light
winters approaches it chained to a high tech and uplit pallet on the floor
we can barely make it out as being the hairy creature from the i beam fight
close quiet so it begins
fights its restraints
winters approaches safely inches away from his fanged maw
creature suddenly lunges forward
winters doesnt flinch
he merely grins at the creature
to general aguila were there any problems
aguila speaks in a gravelly hardened voice
he towers over winters by a foot
clearly the leader of the four
none my lord
to karai you see now thats a good soldier
you two should compare notes
karai and aguila stare at each other
karai obviously not used to being handled like this
just what is this all about
oh lets call it a scavenger hunt
re generals i now have the power and know how but i need the speed and stealth of an organization such as your own
not to mention an organization that values discretion
but of course
you see i have nine more beasts like this that should be coming to town very soon
thirteen in all to be exact
the four generals move the monster into a position on the floor ahead into a disk on the floor
on ceiling we see the top of a cage inserted over top creating a cell
theyre animals at their core
looks off distant and they recognize something familiar in the air
in the stars
what can i say
im a lover of animals
the disk rotates
wider we see that there are already some cells inserted on the large stone disk in the floor
filled by darkened silhouettes of creatures that were probably glad we dont fully see
glowing eyes pierce out of the darkness
so you go and get to know each other
and dont forget
the generals turn and walk push the foot out of the door
they move to fight back but karai waves her hand
our business will be handled at a later time
after they leave we pause for a beat on winters
three brothers sit around their breakfast table looking hung over from the previous nights brawl
mikey comes in looking the worst of all and plops into his seat
cam circles table
dudes did anyone get the license plate of the thing that hit us last night
oi my head
don pours over a thick book on monsters and mythology
was it just me or did that creature look familiar
we coulda taken it if you slackers woulda pitched in sooner
fact remains raph that we should have never been there in the first place
well i suppose that we shoulda let mr
cuddly kins continue to spread happiness throughout the city
he was a freaking monster tryin ta kill us
good call fearless leader
come to think of it it was pretty strange to see the foot too
and who was that woman
i dunno but she sure gave leo a run for his money
still fighting with raph this is my fault now raph
im the only one who has to be responsible
hey youre the trained master not me
quickly interjected dudes can it here comes splinter
on door splinter walks in humming to himself
good morning my sons
splinter makes himself a tea
room is silent
on turtles raph and leo glare at one another while they eat
don is pouring over a thick book while mikey sits with his forehead on the table
if anyone needs me ill be watching my stories
plinter walks out
os sound of the tv being turned on
at the table the glare continues
and in the latest of a string of strange criminal activity a construction site was nearly destroyed last night
authorities believe a violent battle had taken place earlier that evening
the boys react and rush into the main living area
on tv a well coifed news reporter stands outside of the i beam tower
in the daylight we can see the building is twisted and dented from the nights fighting
the boys immediately jump forward
mikey grabs the remote and ups the volume
my sons what splinters eyes go wide
he looks at his boys listening to the tv intently
mikey nurses his sore head
i believe you boys have some explaining to do
splinter looks at the turtles
busted as we the turtles are kneeling before their sensei
leonardo i am most disappointed in you
you are the leader of your brothers
i was counting on you to bring order to the chaos of this family
but master splinter how can i be expected to do so when ra there are no excuses when you are the leader my student
on leo biting his tongue
but the involvement of the foot and their mysterious leader worries me
im personally worried about a monster running around the streets of new york
but hey thats just me
don elbows mikey back in line
we hafta go out and find whos responsible for this
there aint no other solution
raphael there are better ways to use your skills in ninjitsu
direct contact should only be your last resort
save the brute vigilante junk for that nightwing guy
raph stands and exits the room
the others stay silent as we quick shots nightwatcher gearing up
ightwatcher emerges from a man hole
walks to a long forgotten and shadowed underside of a bridge
he points up with a remote chirp
slowly his motorbike begins to lower on retractable grappling hooks
n bike explodes out of a back alley and into the night
various shots of nightwatcher tearing all over the city
on bike and on foot
trying to work it out of his system
hes swallowed it all up to this point
aggressive and driving music
various shots of the stone generals capturing a laundry list of creatures that are coming into the city
see the tech detail and precision that the winters operation works
foot ninja act as living tracking devices around the city
the generals capture a sloth like creature jumping in throughout rafters above
the foot try to help by blocking exits
the generals capture a werewolf like creature in the high speed subway tunnels
the foot maneuver the subway car
general mono takes on a large scale yeti like monster
a wwe sized match set in a large abandoned warehouse
close calls as humans come close to seeing the monsters
but rarely do
we see small house pets swiped away
fleeting glimpses of limbs claws and teeth in the shadows all over nyc
meat trucks torn open and their contents stolen
intermix quick shots of generals and collars clamping cells locking etc
see more cells being filled in winters basement
only quiet part of the neighborhood
their lights are fully on
you sure you dont want to spar a bit
april is dressed in work out gear on a grouping of floor mats
she twirls a wooden katana as part of a floor routine
wow shes actually pretty good
casey eats a bag of chips with one hand does curls with a dumbbell with the other
ever since you started with the blade weapons you um
you kinda scare me
she stops a beat case
are you happy
i mean with your life
casey pauses a beat
tries to be upbeat
beat serious you
april thinks just as much
they sit on that for a moment
casey leans in for a kiss
april doesnt notice
casey changes his mind
walks to the window im going outside for some air
casey slips out onto the fire escape
april knows better
to herself be safe
casey climbs up from the fire escape
checks to make sure hes alone
he reaches inside a chimney flue and pulls out a baseball bat and his classic white hockey mask
he slips it on
does a few warm up swings
cricks his neck
all is still until the panicked face of a burglar enters frame
being held by his collar
the leather fist of nightwatcher slams burglar back tripping over an a c duct
he tries to shield himself reverse angle boom
nightwatcher lands in the fg
funny how you jerks dont care about crossing the line til someone else does it
all over yer head
night hurls him back into a roof access door denting it
raphs loving this
walks to the burglar and picks him up
almost in tears boy oh boy did you pick the wrong night to be a criminal
night cocks his fist just as hey champ
you think youre being a little rough on the guy
ight slowly turns around
caseys taken aback
are you that nightwatcher fella
beat unimpressed a little smaller than i expected
inside helmet case
poking raph with bat im talkin to you pal
you think you own these rooftops
well lemme teach you a thingr two
takes out bat class is pain
meet your instructor
its getting serious
caseys bat is suddenly wrapped by nights chain and pulled down
raphs visor flips up
you keep on playing with fire little man you might just get burnt
is that you
scans costume what what are you doing
are you pretending to be
on raph his eyes look around for an answer
why would you finally gets it oh
a beat so that would mean
then really gets it raph smiles
the first genuine one hes had in a long time
in bg the burglar tries to get away
casey and raph both spy him
look at each other
mischievously grin as we
close on the panicked face of the burglar
cam rotates to show him hanging upside down
cam widens to reveal hes bound by chains and dangling from a street lamp
cam pans up the bg building to reach the two old friends sit perched on a high tower surrounded by gargoyles
they blend right in
both masks are off
i dunno i just got tired of the nothing
sitting around waiting for some disaster to cross our paths
of us battling utroms and triceratons or any other friggin creature
when there was still some guy gettin mugged feet above the lair
just didnt seem right
specially if we had the means to do somethin about it
raph twirls a billy bat between his fingers
and we did
but turns out i was the only one who was willing to do it tho
so i just saved up bought and tweaked a sweet bike fitted the costume and began moonlighting
papers called me the nightwatcher so i went with it
and a legend was born
so what was your handle before that
i kinda liked the midnight marauder
makes an eww face stick with nightwatcher ninja boy
the guys ever catch on
you kiddin me
leos been away for like forever
and the other two are so wrapped up in that party business theyd never notice
so what about you
hows things with april
havent seen yas since you two moved in together
i dunno seems like all i do lately is just make her upset
she used to laugh so much
now its mostly just working all day and coming home to point out how im a screw up
points to hockey mask she doesnt like me doing this
and i know shes pretending to not know im out tonight
but she knows
and she knows i know she knows
looks out at city life just kinda got complicated suddenly
yer tellin me
casey looks at his old bud
nice to see ya man
the moment is broken by a horrible shriek
what was that
they both spring to their feet and run to the back of the roof
they hear the scream again off in the distance
for old times sake
what the shell
on raph he stops mid replacement of his helmet
the two run and leap across the rooftops
two vigilantes searching for the source of the scream
they finally reach a point where they dont hear it anymore
edge of rooftop they look out
i think we lost it
its gotta be around here somewhere
a large vampire like creature flies up from the alley below and spreads its foot wings
its about to attack when thunka thunka thunka its drilled with tranquilizer darts from below
a grappling hook winds around its feet
the creature struggles but is pulled down hard
did i mention we ran into a monster last week
they inch closer to the edge
on alley see the four generals putting a pounding on the creature
they subdue it with all their hardware
the foot stand guard helping in the bg
the freakin foot
looks to generals what about the walking statues
were you going to mention those
those are a first for me too
gets cocky we can take em
one of the generals effortlessly picks up a trash dumpster and wallops the creature with one blow
on second thought
the generals put the creature in a cell
wheel it to a transporter vehicle as it drives away
theyre just about to leave when hink
casey accidentally knocks a tiny piece of rock from the ledge
it falls down clang
on a garbage can lid
on generals they turn around
general gato pov he scans the two
organic earth based
aguila snarls and fires the tranq gun
raph dives in front of casey taking the hit himself
to gato fetch
gato smiles as the other three board a transport vehicle
raph takes out ninja smoke pellets and throws them on the roof fwoom
when the smoke clears casey is standing there alone
raph is feet away as casey flinches and takes off too
you ever heard of smoke pellets
hey youre the ninja not me
gato lands up on the roof and quickly gives chase
they cant lose him even when they drop to street level
raph and casey are tearing ass through the alleyways trying to escape the thing thats close on their tail
raph ignores him looking for a street sign
then he sees it th street
raphael quickly dashes left through traffic
down alley behind them boom boom boom we see gato bounding down the wall almost in a four legged run occasionally jumping off walls at incredible speeds
a true jaguar
it leaps through the traffic as well
under a bridge raph points up and choop
hits a remote that lowers his motorcycle
what are we gonna do raph
what sees bike hey cool ride
raph leaves gato in a cloud of dust
but not for long
gato clamors along
keeping up with the weaving bike
in the fray casey looses his mask
as it gets trampled by gato
its an insane chase with raph trying to lose him as casey swings his bat trying to stave off the stone general
a circular obsidian blade lands in his wooden bat
he looks at it
raph sees the blade
they manage to switch positions in mid ride with casey driving and raph in back
raph throws kicks and punches at their pursuer when he closes in
the chase takes them to a parking garage as they circle upwards gato jumping from car to car still on their tails
rooftop theyre trapped
he doesnt have a hope
aside from jumping the bike to the next roof
he lets out the clutch as they make the jump
sparks and crucial pieces fly off the undercarriage
they both look back at gato up and away at the top of the structure
gato leaves edge and then thumpthumpthump gato jumps down toward them
casey guns it but the bike doesnt work anymore as gato is in mid air taking off
casey grabs the weakening raph and drags him off
gato lands and patrols the roof
almost sniffing them out
casey and raph are barely hidden inside a rooftop shack
gato finds them
he tries to smash through the steel door with his bare hands
raph leans his body into the door as a last ditch effort
hes taking a pounding as the door is denting with each slam by gato
casey tries to help as well
gato comes close to breaking in
then the light on his exo suit begins to strobe
a signal to return home
he surveys quickly
then runs off
casey and raph fall out
both shell shocked
okay so it was great seein ya again raph
on raphael hes got a dart in his shoulder obsidian disks stuck in his shell and has collapsed unconscious
gotta get you someplace safe pal
and then then i need to go buy some new undies
april is finishing up with her workout
she hears the fire escape outside of the building and the window slide open
casey i think we need to talk
turns around i dont want whoa
off her look casey is standing there bracing the near unconscious raph now without his nightwatcher garb
could use a little
how ya been
raph passes out as we splinter and the other three are finishing up dinner
they close the pizza box
my compliments to zee chef
mikey walks to the fridge of leftover birthday cake
anyone for dessert
sick of cake the phone suddenly rings
don rushes over to the jury rigged payphone on the wall
face falls waita slow down april
what happened to raph
well be right there
on window one by one leo don and mikey slip into the window
they spot raph on the futon being tended to by april and casey
mikey looks around
i am in the wrong line of work
nice pad kids
don immediately starts checking raph out
his vital signs seem to be okay
opens his eye pupil dilation is normal
raph weakly pushes donnies head away
frig offa me
temper is normal too
to others hes going to be fine
health wise i mean
otherwise hes still the same old raph
on raphs shell two obsidian disks are wedged in his back with a tranquilizer dart
donnie wedges out the obsidian disk with pliers
lose on disk
its beautiful and deadly
some sort of stone
probably obsidian i think
theres an engraving on it
its definitely not mayan
april swallows hard
it cant be
what cant be april
april sits down on the floor with the disk
trying to figure things out
casey leans down to her
would it help things if i said that we were being chased by a one of those statues you collected for that winters guy
on april her mouth is agape
id say thats a big ten four
its just a myth
it cant be
and i suppose that bringing up the thirty foot flying monster would probably just push this over the edge huh
on april she slowly turns to casey
what are you talking about casey
just some story this winters guy told us
it all started down in south america
long before the ashmecks and the macaroons
azteks and mayans
thats what i said
sit down jones
to group so there was this guy call yaotl
cam pans to the right as it passes a fg element the screen dips to black
we hear sounds of a violent battle
aprils retelling winters story
everyone is gathered around as april finishes
mikey in particular is hunched over intent
casey like before has fallen asleep
silence for a beat
no one knows
the legend stops there
but its just a legend
donnie studies the tranq dart under a magnifying glass of aprils
the micro tech of this dart is astounding
the molybdenum is of a grade only found in a few select markets
not to mention its current stock is going for a little more than two grand an ounce right now
donatello contd looks up what
i dabble in the market
so what do we have
we have someone with a lot of money
access to technology
and the means to produce it to exact specs
not to mention having a keen interest in these monsters
and them four stone jokers
if you ask me it all somehow points to winters corp
how do you figure that donnie
donatello looks up with magnifying goggles on
a beat well that and the fact that this part has a winters corporation logo on it
do you think hes trying to recreate the events from back then
well what would you do with an army of monsters
well aside from having your own wrestling league i dunno
maybe do bad guys still try to do that
yes however theyre usually mortgage re fi companies
what about it april
you just finished working with the guy right
does it make sense
its a legend
is that legend like the ginormous freakin hairball that attacked us
or legend like the moving statues and flying creature that attacked me n casey
ill help for now
until we prove youre all insane
or until we prove winters is up to something more than collecting art
ill work with april and see if these stars of kikin she told us about can give us any clues
i say we just storm the castle and face this jerk in person
raph that would be the worst idea yet
we hang back
formulate a plan then storm your castle
are we clear
tense stare off between raph and leo
raph moves anyway
casey stops him
dont do it man
i spent my whole life running out of rooms ticked off at the world
i wish i could take most of em back
sometimes just takin a breather is the best thing to do
on april shes listening to casey
maybe her man boy is growing up
raph knows he cant win
and bolts out the door
cam is moving fast
really fast down the pipes
raph explodes into frame running faster than us
he lifts up a back pack
he pulls it open revealing his night gear
as he grabs an overhead pipe and flips up and outta sight
we see the same stars weve been tracking move closer into alignment
only now it means so much more to us
cam lowers as we find ourselves donnie looks through a thick book on astronomy
think this is all of them donnie
on door april walks in holding a foot high stack of yellowed documents
i cleaned out my archives on ancient south america
might have found something useful
she takes out a hand drawn map
a map of the stars as recorded by an aztec shaman
they pinpoint the location of the stars of kikin
even though the names changed
for use in an aztec calendar
picks up map so if we can cross reference our current star field positioning of the stars of kikin and backtrack positioning based off of the aztec along with taking
into account the point of origin of the first occurrence we should know where another portal could take place
to herself max what are you up to
leo paces back and forth in the main area
splinter walks in
mikey plays video games on the main tv
leonardo time cannot be moved faster by wearing a groove in our floor
were all stressed
try to chill
youre playing video games on the possible eve of armageddon mikey
but i never said i was having fun
leo looks at the clock
leonardo a true leader knows the virtue of patience
and when to stop exercising it
were almost done leo
you might want to go get him
if you can find him that is
leo looks at splinter clearly feeling leadership pressure and raphs absence makes it worse
he leaves the lair
a few freighters off in the distance
tall dry grass rustles in the wind as we see a treasure hunter a stocky middle aged fat man with a clicking metal detector
big goofy earphones cover his ears
monay monay monay monayyyy really high pitched bad monay
pov from water steadicam shot watching the man patrol under the light of the moon
the clicking intensifies
he follows the signal for twenty feet
drops to the ground and digs the sand
and comes up with a old unopened can of sardines
he turns to leave the beach
lousy metal detector
happy anniversary present my big fat keister
he hurls the can of sardines over his shoulder
only instead of hearing a tiny splash from it hitting the water
we hear a snarling crunch and tinny chewing
the man stops in his tracks
he turns his head around
close on mans face eyes wide in shock
cam pulls back slowing just as the crown of a gnarly skull crests the bottom of the screen
the tin key is spit back onto the sand
barely lit in the hallways of the top private floors of winters tower
the camera travels the long and ornate hallways
decorated in a different sense than the main building
in a sense of family tradition and legacy
ictures spanning centuries in age
cam continues until we find a high backed chair parked in front of an oversized blazing fireplace
on chair winters sits
looks above the fireplace and lifts his snifter in a toast
to picking up the pieces
above fireplace is a suit of armor
the suit of armor of none other than yaotl the conqueror
he looks at it with heavy thought
then what is it
winters doesnt turn around
stays in e fg
cam adjusts to show the shape of general aguila in the doorway
two creatures remain my lord
a long beat
winters closes his eyes
well by all means then
lets finish it
on aguila he squints
deep in thought and not sharing
nightwatcher runs along the rooftops
he lifts his visor to feel the night air on his face
he sees winters tower in the distance
practically egging him on
classic diner design petes diner is closed for the evening
the last light goes out
a greasy diner cook finishes cleaning up the tables
he suddenly hears a noise in the back
kitchen he walks to the back
he hears the noise
now from inside the walk in freezer
he slowly approaches it
he moves to open inside of freezer the door slowly opens
the mans face peers in
his eyes go wide
nightwatcher hears the scream
runs to the source and looks down at petes diner
sees the commotion inside
uses his bolo chain and a power cable to form a zip line down the street as
he goes through the front window
he stands cat like
ready for anything
the room is only lit by the neon signage behind the counter
suddenly night creeps to the freezer
he can hear the chewing and the snarling behind the thick door
he takes out a spiked brass knuckle
places a hand on the door
and opens it
on doorway the creature is huddled over a pile of frozen meat
chewing with pieces flying everywhere
it turns around monkey like and ferocious looking demon
but cute in a bizarre kinda way
music builds as go wider on side view night stands there
the horrible demon creature suddenly jumps out of the freezer too
face off with raph as we realize its only three feet tall
hey there little fella
all that commotion for just little ole y the demon screams
it jumps night slamming him to the floor behind a row of tables
plates glasses and utensils fly everywhere smashing all over the diner as the demon pummels him
close on night the demon is jumping up and down slamming his helmeted head repeatedly to the floor
it lunges forward mouth open as night backhands it with a plate
the demon jumps back and up landing on a rotating ceiling fan
he creature lunges down again but this time night is ready
he fights back
like fighting with a chihuahua hopped up on cocaine
a break in the fight
the creature has disappeared
night knows hes there
grabs his smoke pellets from his pocket
the demon swoops in for another attack
mouth open fangs bared as night tosses the smoke pellets inside
the pellets explode in its mouth sending smoke shooting out of its nostrils ears and eyes
it shrieks flying out of the diner
victory taunting yeah
thats what i thought
dont mess with the nightwatcher
his helmet is still on
he hits his lights on the side of his head to see through the thick smoke
he finds the diner cook huddled behind the counter
night looks scary
pl pl please dont hurt me
whattaya talkin about
i just please sir
i have kids
night looks around
he sees the cash register on the floor
he picks it up puts it on the counter
there ya go pal
make sure this is safe
hey you hearin me
points threatening sudddenly shink
a throwing star is lodged in the cash register till
looks out the window
cam pulls way way back really fast out the diner and to the rooftop across the street
and over the green shoulders of leo
ll he sees is a panicked man and the large shape of nightwatcher standing over him holding the register
close on leo hes fuming
staring down at nightwatcher
the frustration of the last few days pent up inside of him
ack in diner night slowly lays down the register
trying to figure out his next move
this night just keeps gettin better n better
tense stand off as
night suddenly bolts out the back as leo bolts the roof in hot pursuit
night tears down the streets and through back alleys
leo keeps up with him effortlessly hurling an assortment of throwing stars his way
night suddenly dashes out into traffic
jumping over passing cars from roof to roof
nice try amateur
leo crosses the busy street while still maintaining his secrecy
zip lines through power lines avoids an oncoming bus and flips back onto a cable
e swings and manages to snag nightwatcher in mid leap
youre a heavy boy arent you
they both land on a fire escape as night clamors to the top
leo wastes no time in catching up
the chase continues
night giving it his all and leo keeping up pretty easily
he throws leo a pretty strong curveball and leo barely recovers
okay someones been training pretty hard
it begins to spit rain and becomes a frank miller downpour
night reaches an area thats a dead end
one side of the buildings has a large lettered sign facing away
fills the rooftop with silhouettes
no choice but to turn around
as leo slows to a stop at the other end of the building
i want you to know that i appreciate your intentions
but you cant change the world like this
inside helmet all we hear is rain pouring
raph cant hear leo just sees him wagging his finger at him
to himself in helmet oh god
now audible so im going to give you one chance to just walk away and stop this vigilante nonsense
leo unsheathes his two katanas
raph cant hear him
to himself in helmet okay leo
nightwatcher drops twin bolos
he twirls them with expertise
then motions for leo to fight
charge at each other running through the rain weapons drawn
and with expertise
two masters duking it out
it surprises leo
it fills night with more adrenaline
theres a break
they circle like tigers
night knows every one of leos moves and counters in turn
how did you then he starts goading him on
making him mad
and then leo fights back
night cant keep up
leo uses every bit of his control restraint and expertise
he surgically slices the bind under nights helmet
he jumps on top of the vigilante
goodnight dark prince
leo uppercuts night knocking his helmet off
his face falls
but raph doesnt feel like explaining
he mule kicks leo back
leo tumbles back still in shock
they yell at each other through the pouring rain
youre so friggin smug
you think the world revolves around you dontcha
that we couldnt possibly survive without the mighty and powerful leonardo to guide us through our problems huh
well i gotta newsflash for ya we got along just fine without you
i was training
training to be a better leader
why do you hate me for that
and whoever said i wanted to be led
i shoulda gone on that training
ou werent ready
youre impatient and hot tempered
and more importantly
im better than you
raph stops in his tracks
reaches behind his back
and pulls out his twin sais
he flips them to the front
well big brother id have to disagree with you on that one
raph takes a ready stance
leo does too
and they fight
in another part of the city the generals have caught the demon from petes diner
as they carry him to the caravan their radio comm goes off
the foot report of strange activity five blocks north of your location
the final creature
camera rises up until we reach the rooftop where leo and raph continue to duke it out in the rain
in the end raph becomes an uncontrollable ball of anger unleashing everything on leo
it ends with raph pinning leo to the ground
holding a sai tense
he looks like hes going to do it
he collapses back
almost ashamed of what hes done
leo just cant believe that raph bested him
they pant heavily
the rain dies down
raph runs away across a few rooftops
away from his brother
he suddenly stops and looks back at leo small in the distance
close on leo a shadow suddenly falls over him
he looks up to see the four generals surrounding him
he tries to fight back
but is too wiped from raph
gato pov reading leo on the ground
it is neither monster nor human
close on aguila he manages a small smile
then he shall perfectly serve our purposes
let us inform our commander that the final creature has been captured
on raph he sees the commotion from afar
as leo gets tranquilized with the generals dart cannon
raph runs closer as the generals lower to the ground and drive off
raph jumps from rooftop to rooftop to try and catch his brother
but the caravan is too fast and eventually loses raph
raph gets weak and collapses to his knees on the roof
the sun begins to rise
he has to return to the sewer
april and don are poring over books at the kitchen
mikey paces behind them
raph storms in barrels past them all
raphael walks to splinter practicing himself in the dojo
raph holds his sais in one hand his bolo chain in the other
clenches both tight
what is the matter
i was out and did
something happened and i arrrgh
raphael picks up a heavy weight and hurls is across the dojo
splinter is unfazed but he wont take any more
falls in line walking to splinter and dropping to his knees in front of his father
i did something
i did something really stupid master splinter
i know why you chose him now
i know that theres a reason why hes the better son and im not
and i think i made things worse tonight
beat calming down a whole lot worse
i know you must be ashamed of me father
raphael is lost in his guilt
splinter kneels in front of raph
you always bear the worlds problems on your shoulders
it is an admirable quality when you are a protector of others
plinter gently lays a hand on raphs shoulder
but you must realize that while at times you may not be my favorite student it does not mean that you are my least favorite son
raphael looks up
having not thought of it that way
you are strong passionate and loyal to a fault
these are the merits of a great leader as well
but only when tempered with compassion and humility
but master splinter i messed up big tonight
i mean big
splinter chews on this
r beat ashamed yes
splinter is grim
but he moves on
well then i believe your brothers may be in need of a leader
raphael looks up
finally his shot
he holds his sais in one hand and his bolo chain in the other
ninja turtle vs
he grips them both hard
he drops the chain
mikey bursts in the door frantic
i think youre gonna want to check this out
raph and splinter share a look
raph has to tell the others
april and donnie sift through their charts and calculations
so the first time that this portal was opened the stars of kikin aligned
sketches on high tech and thats why it occurred in that specific south american region
more doodles now if we take into account the continual rotation of the earth since then as well as the gradual celestial shift thats happened and been recorded over
well over the course of that mountain of books over there
we now know our new location
donnies drawn a new line from the alignment of the stars
april elbows casey to wake him up
degrees latitude and
on others huh
mikey air calculates math in bg
new york city
and the alignment is due to occur in precisely checks watch well
it sits in the room
but without leo
what do we do
no one answers
splinter looks to raph
raph steps up
we rescue our brother
and save new york city
splinter stands to his side
dark storm clouds gather over winters tower
a horrible electrical storm is brewing
the lobby has changed
shots establishing the jury rigged nature of winters tower
the large aztec like calendar on the lobby floor suddenly splits and slides open creating a foot circle in the middle
underneath is the towers cell basement
the disk in the basement is suddenly raised up to the lobby area replacing the slick marble design with an antiquated stone version
only now thirteen creature cells surround the disk
finally winters office elevator lowers from high above
hes in the actual ceremonial gear worn by yaotl years ago
he holds the helmet to his side
he looks over his now ceremonial lobby
push in on one cell as leo sits hunched over unconscious and helpless
quick shots of april and casey gearing up
casey with his off the shelf sporting gear
april with sleek looking japanese combat gear and weaponry
they both emerge from their rooms dressed to kill
caseys jaw drops as we scope out april
models it picked it up on my last trip to japan
they share the moment
seeing what they forgot about each other when they first met
its enough for them to smile
wheres your mask
faking confusion mask
april runs into the other room and comes back with her hands behind her back
she takes out a new mask for casey cool crisp and a badass paintjob
i was saving it for our anniversary
almost awkward as casey leans forward and is about to kiss her
then a musical tune first bar of the tmnt series plays on a car horn outside interrupting them again
thats our ride
cam pulls back from the back seat
everyone is in the zone
splinter and don sit in the back seat
pulling further toward the front we see april and casey
nd on raph in passenger seat and mikey driving
you know i aint much on speeches
but we can do this
leo or no leo
looks around not because of our individual strengths
but because of how we function as a team
i love you man
dont push it
to april april this is going to be dangerous
you sure youre in
i feel responsible fellas
i found the generals for him
cam continues to pull out as the familiar jingle of cowabunga carl fades in and we see the cowabunga carl party van in full view
nice an incognito there mikey
well i didnt see you offering any suggestions
besides imitates splinter a true ninja can hide in plain sight my son
i heard that
van takes off as the camera slows in the street watching it drive away
nyc civilians point to the sky worried
push in on a tv stereo store window simons electronics
on tv broadcasting a news report
black clouds brew over head
scientists are calling it the fiercest storm of the new millennium with dopler radar readings coming in off the charts
authorities are imposing a curfew to avoid possible civilian harm
stay tuned for more in minutes
further down the street we see winters tower and the darkest clouds of all beginning to collect overhead
winters stands with four generals in his office overseeing the portal
karai walks down the center path of the garden flanked by a dozen foot ninja
she motions for them to take position
as ordered no one gets in
no one interferes
no one bears witness
suddenly the security alarm from the front gate buzzes
karai waits a beat
it buzzes again
she walks to the security panel by the front gate
n monitor we see casey standing there obscured by a large wooden crate in front of him
karai coldly opens the gate
may i help you
yeah hey i was supposed to drop this off for mr
if i dont get this done i am majorly in the doghouse
you know what im sayin right
the two stare at each other as the cam angles behind karai shes holding a katana sword behind her back
am dollies overhead as we see that casey is packing major sports gear heat on his end too
both dont let on
please come in then
beat gets composed i mean but of course
casey wheels the crate inside
the gate closes only karai has now disappeared
casey opens the front hatch revealing don raph mikey april and splinter
lets never do this again
waves hand in front of nose glares at mikey and who did that
why does everyone always call me out
a long beat
i apologize my sons
everyone looks at sheepish splinter
suddenly wider the empty garden begins to move
creepy as dozens of foot ninja begin to rise out of the shadows and slink toward our heroes surrounding them
karai makes a dramatic entrance landing in front of april and casey
i suppose this is where we all take out our sharp and pointy things
you suppose correctly
on heroes as they all draw their weapons
high angle as the foot all draw theirs
raph twirls his sais
i am so gonna enjoy this
winters walks along all the cells a final check
he examines one of the cells
push in its leo
hes slowly waking up groggy
he passes out again
we finally get to see how much of an ass kicker master splinter is
same with april who squares off against karai
they fight hard
april ends up cornered about to be skewered by her blade when
she wobbles and then passes out
when karai falls out of frame she reveals casey jones a hundred yards behind her holding his hockey stick
i had the situation under control
mikey fights the most like jackie chan comical maneuvers backed by solid hitting blows
don uses his bo staff in different ways both offensively and defensively
casey is enjoying the hell out of it
high flying adrenaline rush
he even catches april checking him out and vice versa
april suddenly spots an opening to the front doors
front door is open
they all charge the front door
winters is happy
he looks up to the heavens
checks a time piece
winters begins chanting ancient magick spells
looks up through the opening in the middle of the building
the cam pulls up through the building
up over nyc
through the clouds
and into space until we pass all aligned stars
pace the final star drifts into position
a light burst effect travels down each star headed to earth
back in lobby the light burst flies into the lobby and hits the circle in the middle of all the monsters cells
on circle the pieces suddenly start to move around
almost like a sliding puzzle
then they start to randomly sink further into the ground
light pours out of them until all of them give way to create the portal
pov office above each of the thirteen cells light up to acknowledge their contents
on generals theyre still
the light sequence gets to leos cell
it doesnt light up
his mind reels
looks down at the cells
then it hits him like a ton of bricks
he turns to the generals
what did you do
our six heroes all tear into the lobby
they turn back an army of ninjas closing in on them
what do we do dudes
im working on it
raph grips his sais with renewed strength
casey looks around putting things together mentally
we get ready for round two
on casey in corner he reaches into his back takes out a hockey stick and smash
kills a lobby vase
suddenly sirens blare as the outside building security shutters slam down just like in act i
the ninjas are locked out
everyone high fives casey
nice work jones
i have my moments
off dons look the mayhem builds at the other end of the vast lobby
the cells are glowing
the portal worsens
and that would be the swirling vortex to another world i assume
they all run over
mikey runs to a cell
is that you
a claw swoops out
he dodges out of the way
i guess that would be a no
on raph he finds leo
out of the way please
on places a small explosive on a key lock
raph pulls leo out
come on man
leo please wake up
raph holds leo in his lap on the floor
looks like leo is dead
raphs head falls low as
wh wh what took you s so long
wider leo is alive
coughs and slowly gets his strength back
he and raph look at each other
leo can only imagine what raphs been through to rescue him
listen i im sorry
leo forgives him
moment is suddenly broken by an os angle up as winters is thrown out the window of his elevator office
he heads straight for a sword wielding bronze statue
particularly the sword part
just misses it
he crashes onto the floor
on group they just stare at him
back up to the office nearly feet above them
on balcony above aguila looks down
winters body still lays on the floor
this is bad
is he dead
mikey takes out a hockey stick from caseys bag and pokes winters limp body
hes way dead dude
winters gasps for air
startles everyone in the room
on everyone their faces all drop as winters stands up in his mini crater brushes himself off and is perfectly fine
winters mind is racing a mile a minute
doesnt even notice those around him
raph cant take it any more
he draws his sais and thrusts them at winters
that gets his attention
winters looks up in awe at seeing the mutated freaks in front of him
we mean you no harm
im about to give you piercins in places you never imagined if you dont tell us whats going on
we were so close
winters collapses on the floor
head in hands
this was our chance
we could have changed it all
we know everything max
we know youre trying to recreate what yaotl started years ago
n winters he looks up
exhausted as we the same red tinted battlefield we left in winters flashback
monsters are leaping through the hoards
there are things miss oneil no one could possibly know
camera pushes in on yaotl and his four generals high on a hill surveying the action
on yaotl he takes off his helmet
its winters himself
it was i who stood on that battlefield all those years ago
winters yaotl looks out at the death and destruction
he looks shocked surprised
a shadow falls over winters body
he looks up its a ceremonial shaman from their enemies camp
and we had to pay a price
the shaman makes hand gestures chanting
winters is pulled up in the air and in a crackle of red electricity we see him become
n generals same electricity
they scream slowly turned into stone
cracks form on their bodies light shooting out of it
we were cursed that day
my four comrades in arms were turned into stone
winters contd cursed to live on this earth
yet fully aware at all times to ponder the crimes weve committed
on winters he stands on the battlefield
as he walks the cam moves around him
during this we x dissolve between a few select time periods between then and now
my curse was to live
to feel the pain of losing love time and time again
ack in present day
winters stops walking
we were doomed to live this way until as the shaman put it you corrected the mistakes of your past
gestures to the lobby thats what this is about
penance miss oneil
finally getting a chance to right our wrongs
our master fails to include crucial points in his tale
on shadows the four generals thump forward
he fails to discuss the petrified agony of three thousand years
of the torture of taking centuries to merely blink an eye
of watching the erosion of your own body throughout centuries
so while our great leader basked in the warmth of the sun and the glory of fresh air
we rotted in the stone hell that lasted throughout wmillennia
my brothers i we are no brothers to you
our brotherhood was broken the day that you condemned us to this eternity
on doors cam pulls back along doors as each one is barely forced open and dozens of foot ninjas pile in the lobby
karai comes to fg of group
surveys as the scene continues
and now our master has tired of feeding on the nectar of life
of loving his entire life
gestures to portal so he prefers to end it all
end his misery at the expense of ours
aguila walks to the cells
the portal writhes in the bg sinking into the floor
but thanks to his cunning his technology we are now capable of living
we have now become close creepy gods
and we shall finish what we began all those years ago
we will finally have our victory
even with one monster still free the curse can never be broken
to winters join us
join us yaotl and live a life eternal with us at your side
on winters he waits
this was our opportunity
we were wrong
dont you understand
and you are weak
to karai destroy them
karai sees winters condition
clearly getting screwed by the very beings who have been nothing but hostile toward her and her foot clan
she suddenly gestures with her hands military ninja style
what does that mean
it means were going to help you
wider foot ninja disperse around out of the building leaving karai and foot ninja behind
my soldiers will find the thirteenth monster
and you will bring it back here
hurry we dont have much time
karai runs off
april looks over at winters
he nods still hurting
april takes off after karai leaving casey behind with the four foot
they run out into the garden just in time to see the other foot disappear into the night
i got shotgun
back on generals they move toward winters
the turtles quickly look at one another
know what they have to do
they all leap in the way standing between winters and his backstabbing generals
aguila moves forward to leo
raph steps in beside him defiant
if you mess with one of us looks around you mess with all of us
aguila smiles at their chutzpa
the portal worsens behind them
sound and sight
the eight are ready to fight
and the fight begins
the turtles leap pounce and strike with all the exuberance and intensity theyve ever had
winters moves to help the turtles
suddenly a walking stick across his chest stops him
they must face them alone
winters debates it in his head for a beat wham
a tentacle from the portal slams down next to him
we have more important things to do
on portal a small demon makes its way out of the portal
winters runs and flips through the air and then clobbers it with his bare hands sending it back down
he lands on the other side
help me push the cells into the portal
splinter does as the two masters also manage to lay some smackdown on any emerging creature out of the portal
this has got to be the suckiest vehicle to save the world with
as the cowabunga carl van roars around the corner
tinkling musical notes chime along with the speed
appropriately lame and embarrassing
inside van casey drives as april karai and four foot are crammed in the back
anybody from out of town
lobby the combatants all pair off for their final battle
mikey is paired with serpiente
donnie is paired with the general mono
he uses his quick speed and expert staff against the hammer weilding statue
leo fights with gato
he cant dodge him
hes too fast
leo lands a lucky blow but gato recoils boom
leos knocked shell first into a large glass display case filled with swords and bladed weapons of all kinds
come to daddy
moments later smash
leo steps out ready for action
strapped with a dozen swords tucked all over his body
he pulls them out randomly as needed throughout the fight
raph and aguila duke it out in and around the monster cells
its a jackie chan inspired sequence where they have to be aware of their environment to avoid defeat
how you guys doing
on splinter and winters the portal is pulling the cells in
about five more to go
splinter also flips around and takes out another demon trying to escape
splinter actually seems to be having fun
wonderful my son
back with april and casey rush the streets of nyc
my troops have located the final monster
at the harbor docks
oh i got this one covered
casey guns it for the pier music tinkling
cam zooms ahead through the streets until it reaches the pier
cam cranes over the harbor warehouses until we see the th monster
looks like a land locked giant crocodile
it appears unconscious a hundred or so tranq darts sticking out of its back
the van pulls onto the scene
nside the van everyone is in shock
the ninjas look at each other
now theres somethin you dont see every day
they pile out of the van
off of monster well i guess we have to figure out how to get handsome here back to winters tower
we should tie it to the van and drag it back
on creature a foot ninja stands next to the lifeless body
as he turns his head he doesnt see the creatures eye open
wider the creature stands up as everyone turns to see
the creature dog shakes his hide sending the tranq darts flying everywhere
they slam into the walls like shrapnel
on foot as they dive out of the way
one gets hit with a dart in the chest
on van as they open the doors to act as shields as thunka thunk thunk darts stick in the door
on creature hes now standing
and dying to chase something
it growls screams as they all pile into the van
casey immediately throws it in reverse and starts peeling back on the pier barely staying out of the clutches of the creature smashing the pier in front of them
get to the end and spin the vehicle around
casey guns it the foot creature mere inches away
stars in sky karai sees the stars are slowly moving out of alignment
losing time fast
back in lobby crane down on winters and splinter
on the last full cell
on portal a pair of large eyes are threatening to come out
in the bg dozens of winged demons fly around inside
they better hurry with that last monster
im sure my man caseys got it all under control
thats what im afraid of
back with van close on caseys face as hes screaming his guts out
wider we see that hes on top of the van acting as live bait to attract the creature
its working too
the creature pounces along like an awkward greyhound run
casey is throwing sports equipment at it from his large hockey bag
the creature is catching and eating it all
inside van casey slips in
what are you doing in here
ran outta food
they all look out the back window as the creature pounds closer and closer
back in lobby the turtles and generals are at a standstill
turtles all get thrown into a pile between the generals
im the last guy to sound like a tv cartoon but i think we need to work together
the more you know
don clocks mikey behind the head
why raph no solo act tonight
they stand backs to back
finally as a team
they trust one another and their efficiency shows
on portal more tentacles begin to come out
more claws surround the surface edges
on tmnt the music swells
the brothers act and think as one
the way they should
they way they will from now on
on splinter as cam pushes in he stands up
seeing his sons
yes my sons
the generals cant keep up
its enough to distract them to make mistakes the tmnt take advantage of
on winters sees the portal light beginning to shrink
because of the tmnts moves the generals are now on the precipice of the portal being pulled back
they struggle to stand
the brothers look at each other
the place is violent with a whirlwind and screaming monsters
so who wants ta call it a day
roger dodger dude
the tmnt launch into their final attack perfectly in synch and take out each of the generals knocking them back into the portal
theyre plucked out of mid air by cloudy tendrils and pulled back
the turtles collapse onto the floor back to the portal
splinter runs over to them
my sons i am so proud of you all
the generals arms slam onto the ridge of the portal beginning to climb out
the turtles jump back
we are immortals made of stone
the earth has only begun to feel our wrath
the brothers are screwed
they cant stop the generals
until behind turtles glowing headlights grow larger
the van flies through the lobby musical chime and all being trailed by the creature
april clips a corner as the vehicle spins out of the path
he creature tries to stop but cant on the marble floor
it falls sliding clicking its claws trying to stop
winters dives in and pushes the turtles out of way as the creature flies in and knocks the generals back into the portal
the cloud tendrils grab a hold of it and pull it back into the portal
on stars the stars move out of alignment ending the cycle
on portal it begins to close
the generals struggle to get out only now we see they are human
their curse broken
and an eternity of pain and suffering ahead of them
aguila tries to fight his way out of the portal
raph and leo team roundhouse him back into oblivion
i thought hed never shut up
wider the portal explodes in a upwards funnel
the brothers high five one another
splinter smiles proud
on van dusty and smoking
the door clangs open
casey piles out
karai comes next and accidentally falls on casey in a very compromising position
she slyly smiles
april falls out last beside them
caught looks at both oh
i uh huhn
casey tosses karai off of him
aprils eye cocks
dont try to tell me for one second that you didnt enjoy tha casey just grabs her cutting her off and they kiss
like they should have been kissing all along
they pull apart revealing mikey standing there
watching them all gooey eyed
raph and leo look at each other
dialogue would just ruin this moment
splinter walks over to them
cam adjusts to show karai and the foot ninja standing there
finally karai steps forward you are every bit the warriors i was informed you were
you have passed
on tmnt theyre confused
you know us
ive known of you for some time
beat to leos question savor your victory tonight
for soon we will have further business together
what kind of business
the kind that involves familiar faces from your past
on turtles they all look at each other
she doesnt mean
they look back and see karai and the foot have disappeared
raph looks over at winters
hes hunched over in the corner
cant tell whats going on
they walk over slowly
on winters looks like hes sobbing
they get concerned
then the sobs turn to laughing
he stands up
his hand is spotted red with his m own blood from a cut on his cheek
im never usually that happy to be bleeding
you would be if you were an immortal who couldnt bleed for three thousand years
winters looks at all the turtles
thank you from the bottom of my heart
youve made a very old man very very happy
so um what happens now
on winters he just smiles
finally at peace
as he ages thousands of years in front of us
eventually turning to dust and blowing away
just a little bit creepy
i think hes in my n n cam pulls back out of the building onto the street
see the destruction
the clearing skies
raph comes to splinters room
you wanted to see me sensei
sit down raphael
thank you master splinter for your guidance
thinks humble i can only hope that one day i will be able to begin the next stage of my training like leo
reaches into a box and takes out a similar medallion to the one given to leonardo
that my son you already have
our training works in mysterious ways
but the answer that lies in all our questions
raph beams as he accepts the badge
he excitedly stands up
splinter looks to the hallway where his eyes meet leos
they exchange knowing smiles as splinter winks and we a rockin number plays as we cap everyones adventures
splinter walks through the lair
he walks past their trophy room
he places the ornate head of winters cane on the shelf
he sits down to meditate
but first reaches into his robe and pulls out a tin foil package
he opens it up and smiles
double chocolate fudge
mikey and don are on the rooftops
leo and raph join them on top
leo and raph have an aside to themselves
so were cool with the whole nightwatcher thing
yeah were cool
our secret bro
checks for clear coast you got rid of the stuff right
quick shot nightwatchers gear burning in a barrel
what about the bike tho
discreet confessional okay so i couldnt exactly destroy the bike
lets just say its in good hands
what do you mean
i mean its in good hands
thinks then realizes oh you didnt
raph sheepishly shrugs as we as casey roars down the street on the black motorcycle of nightwatcher barely able to hang on
he drives past winters tower now being converted to a a hitchhiker thumb comes into frame
casey stops his bike
wider its april
casey hands her a helmet
aprils pov inside helmet we see a small diamond ring taped to the visor
she takes it off
models it on her hand
she leans forward
she wraps her arms around his waist and holds tight for the adventures that await
cam follows for a beat then rises up the buildings to all four turtles are horsing around
they get geared up
and head off for a game of ninja tag
the boys run hoot and holler as they fly high on the rooftops
so what makes a family
personally its more than sharing a roof or a bathroom
its sharing life
my father taught me that and i think its pretty much true
yknow provided that you dont kill each other in the process
or that no one touches your stuff
or makes loud noises when youre trying to sleep
they run close to the camera once again a family
hey nobody said it was easy
