written by christopher de vore eric bergren david lynch based on the elephant man a study in human dignity by ashley montagu close up of a gold framed miniature portrait
of john merricks mother tune or melody over her picture heartbeat which dissolves to close up of real mother smiling a shadow comes over her face
close up of elephant ears trunks faces moving
dark heavy feet stomping elephant trumpet rearing up
powerful hit and the mother falls
trunk slides over mothers face and breasts and stomach leaving a moist trail
mothers pov of elephants mouth eyes skin
mothers face twists and freezes in a blurred snap roll
knock knock sound
curtain opens to horrified faces
fade in to steam shooting out of a huge old half rusted calliope
the music is very loud and raucous
moving up and back we see the black awning entrance to the freak tent where frederick treves resident surgeon and lecturer on anatomy at the london hospital is standing with
his back to us observing the posters of the freaks
coming along a muddy walkway at the side of the tent is treves wife anne and their two daughters
the shrill over whelming music seems to engulf her
she looks discomfited vulnerable and protective of her daughters
the girls oblivious to any fear are finishing their chocolate sweets
close up of treves looking at a poster
he hears poppa
treves turns and looks down to a chocolate covered face
he smiles at the children and anne
anne sees the dirty faces and begins cleaning one of them
the other daughter looks into the freak tent
may we go in there
she turns the girl away from the freak tent and begins cleaning her face
her kerchief pulls and distorts the little daughters face
suddenly the girl sees a ring of elephants in the distance
oh look m ummy
well go see them
to treves you wont be long
ill join you shortly
she takes the children off toward the elephants
treves watches them go for a moment then turns and we go with him into the dark freak tent
he pauses to pay admission at a small booth then disappears within
we hear what could be the trumpeting of an elephant
treves parts the black canvas and enters the main part of the tent
off to his left he sees a man wrapped in a black cape holding a conch shell aloft and blowing powerfully into it
the tent is dimly lit with flickering oil lamps
people mill about through the weaving corridors
to treves right he sees a sign reading the deadly fruit of the original sin over a small very dark corridor
treves enters the passage and disappears into the shadows
the corridor has a series of flaps and turns to disorient the spectator
treves carefully pushes his way through and arrives at the inner chamber
in a roped off space stands a small stage set at eve level with curtains on three sides
on the stage is a bell jar filled with grey murky fluid lit from behind with casts an eerie glow in the chamber
suspended in the fluid is the life sized body of a baby doll with the attached head of a large snake
at the join of head and body is a blob of unidentifiable organic matter
it is obviously phony but the effect is still very disquieting
at the bottom of the jar in the muck sits an apple with two large bites out of it
behind the jar is a painting on the order of a religious triptych portraying adam on one side eve on the other and the tree flowering over the jar
treves impassive face is bathed in the watery glow
he studies the strange object with a critical eye
in the passage we hear movement and an older gentleman enters
he seems visibly impressed with the deadly fruit of the original sin
a wicked birth
after a moment treves quietly leaves the inner chamber
as he pushes his way through the corridor the noise grows and becomes a cacophony of strange sounds
he exits and hears a booming roar and the rush of air as a series of twelve candles mounted in a row on a ten foot stand are blown out
by the incredible wind man
his barker steps up and talks to the people
ladies and gentlemen his lungs are larger than this mammoth blacksmiths bellows
so great is his power of exhalation rivaling even that of the great north wind that he will now challenge two grown men to attempt to hold the bellows shut
as he applies the mighty blast of his herculean breath
are there any volunteers
a few people raise their hands
the barker scans the crowd and then points over the heads of the volunteers to two men toward the back
i see two likely lads
pit your strength against the mighty wind man
during the above the incredible wind man removes his cape revealing his great barrel chest and pot belly supported by spindly white hairless legs
as the barker sets the volunteers the wind man walks about the small platform huffing and puffing and blowing on the conch shell
the volunteers set the wind man steps up to the end of the bellows takes an enormous breath and twirls his black handlebar moustache as a signal to the barker
are you ready
yes we are
ladies and gentlemen
let the demonstration begin
the wind man clamps his mouth to the bellows and with great show begins to exhale savagely stamping his feet
the two lads struggle obviously and then pretend to be forced apart
the barker triumphantly lifts the wind mans hand
the wind man ceases to blow removes his lips from the bellows and the two lads instantly collapse together on the floor
ladies and gentlemen
the the crowd cheers while the wind man puts the conch shell to his lips and proudly stamps his feet circling about the two lads
amidst this applause treves smiles indulgently
he moves on looking for something genuine
two bobbies move through the crowd intent upon a certain destination
treves conveys a casual interest in them
treves moves on to a bearded lady who combs her beard busily chewing tobacco and spitting into a spittoon
treves continues to work his way through the crowd
up ahead he sees the bobbies
they round a corner
oh yes they are theyre yours alright
we hear the laughter of a crowd
treves moves closer to see a fat lady seated in a chair on the next platform
on each knee she holds a dwarf
they are dressed as babies
a skeleton man stands beside her
i refuse to believe it
i will not accept it
those babies are simply too ugly they cannot be mine
the crowd laughs uproariously
i dont want them
get rid of them
i dont want to see them
darling dont be difficult
lets take our sweet lovely children on an outing
well take these miserable whelps on an outing alright
well take them to the zoo
where they will stay
from the direction the bobbies have gone we hear several screams
pausing at the screams children save yourselves
prevail upon your pappa
the two dwarves get down from her knees and approach the skeleton man
they kneel and tug at his thin legs
at this point a father holding his young son in his arms passes by treves
the young boy clutches his fathers neck in fear hiding his face
out loud to no one in particular this is too much
they should not allow it
they should not allow it
treves very curious now along with several others make their way around the corner
before him treves sees an agitated crowd staring at something that from his point of view he cannot see
brushing past him is a woman pulling a small confused and frightened little girl
getting closer to the commotion he sees four bobbies standing with a well dressed alderman arguing with the owner of this particular exhibit
a distraught almost hysterical woman is ineffectually striking the owner with her fists about his head and shoulders crying weakly and incoherently
treves is just about to see whatever it is that is causing the alarm when one of the bobbies says no
thats right out
drop the curtain
as the curtain drops treves just glimpses baggy trouser cuffs and two horribly deformed root like feet
the distraught woman has been pulled away from the owner and is sobbing on a bobbys shoulder
you cant do that
ive got my rights
i have the authority to close you down and im doing just that
in the crowd treves notices a young boy staring open mouthed blankly at the curtain
treves pushes through the glut of people to join the boy and get a better view
the curtain is actually a large canvas
on it is a life sized portrait crudely painted of a creature that could only be possible in a nightmare
it is the figure of a man turning into an elephant
the transformation however is not complete there is still more of the man than beast
palm trees in the background suggest the jungle habitat in which this perverted object might have once roamed
filled with curiosity treves moves toward the curtain
this exhibit degrades all who see it as well as the poor creature himself
hes a freak
how else can he live
freaks are one thing
no one objects to freaks but this is entirely different
this is monstrous and ought not to be allowed
these officers will see to it that you are on your way as soon as possible
the alderman turns and leaves the tent
to himself movin again
he shakes his head in disgust
now at the canvas treves tries to lift the edge to get a peek inside the wagon but the meaty hand of the owner clamps down on his wrist
have a care guvnor
the two men look at each other for a solid moment
treves backs away and returns his gaze to the painted canvas
we see a bellows pumping air into the open grate of a cast iron stove
we hear moaning in the background
the coals flare to a fierce glow
from the mouth of the stove protrude the handles of several cauterizing irons their heads imbedded in the coals
up above the irons treves stands by a waist high operating table covered with black leather
his face is illuminated by an oil lantern held by a nurse
the room is fairly dark owing to the oppressive overcast sky seen through two windows
there is also a large sink a cupboard containing dressings gags manacles emetics and other unattractive things and two hard chairs
two students and two other doctors mr
fox and mr
hill are present
the two students are pulling with constant pressure on a rope tied to the patients leg
treves and mr
fox are working on a chest wound caused by a machine accident
there are gear wheel marks getting progressively deeper as they near a great open gash
hill places a cotton mask over the patients nose and mouth and applies drops of chloroform
the patient struggles but soon his moans subside and he is unconscious
how long has this man been here
three quarters of an hour
hodges pierce come closer
hill take hold of the rope please
its a machine accident
i expect youll be seeing a good deal of this
the two medical students come forward
they stare uneasily at the gaping wound which bubbles each time the man takes an agonized breath
treves and fox quickly and expertly tend the wound as hodges and pierce look on
off handedly abominable things these machines
one cant reason with them
what a mess
treves now notices that the students faces have gone a trifle ashen
what got you into medicine hodges
my father sir
hes built quite a successful practice
i hope to take it over one day
is that your case as well pierce
though of course i do have a great desire to help my fellowman
treves smiles at them knowingly
of course you do realize that medicine has changed quite a bit since your fathers time
in those days we didnt even wash our coats
in fact the sign of a truly accomplished surgeon was his black operating coat so stiff with dried blood and pus that it could stand up by itself in the
ive still got mine upstairs
you dont mind blood do you
oh no sir
good thats one thing weve always plenty of
a hospital messenger boy dressed in a blue uniform and a can is making his way down the hall
he stops and looks into an operating room much like the one we have just seen
inside the room is empty
the boy closes the door and continues on to another operating room
the doctors move with great urgency around the operating table
blood is draining down into a white porcelain bowl
a woman can be heard moaning
the boy looks carefully but finally closes the door and continues on his way
there is a hissing sound and steam from the cauterizing of the wound comes up obscuring part of treves face
the patient is being held down firmly by the other men
the door opens and treves looks up
the boy pops his head in
excuse me mr
i found it
studying the boy carefully did you see it
the boy shakes his head slowly no
ill be with you in a moment
the boy closes the door
quietly i say freddie what are you about
nothing of any great importance
aerial shot from third floor of the london hospital looking down on the hospital square
below treves is walking briskly across the square through a gate and into the slums beyond
the aerial shot is actually foxs pov and now we see fox filled with curiosity watching the figure from a window
looking down from above and to the side of him we follow treves walking through a cobblestone street still wet from a recent rain covered with horse manure and filth
of all sorts
the air is smoky from meat burning fires
rounding a corner we see and approach the painted canvas sign of the elephant man covering the front of a small dingy shop
the door of the shop is windowless and padlocked
treves walks into the picture studies the whole scene for a moment goes to the shop door and finds that it is padlocked
treves tries to look under an edge of the canvas
to his left he sees a small boy watching him intently
do you know where the proprietor is
he holds a coin out
the boy nods snatches the coin and then disappears around the corner
treves turns back to the canvas
a noisy pub long and narrow
benches run the length of the back wall with small tables up against them
men are clustered around the bar talking in groups
we see the boy standing at one of the tables talking to the owner greedily consuming his lunch as he listens
the boy gestures outside
the boy comes out the door quickly followed by the owner hurriedly putting on his coat fumbling with a riding crop the last of his sandwich stuffed in his mouth
the boy and the owner are carefully looking around the corner at treves still in front of the portrait
hes not a peeler
no i dont think so
i dont think so
they walk into the street
the owner and the boy walk up to treves
are you the proprietor
and who might you be sir
just one of the curious
id like to see it
i dont think so
no sir were closed
treves pulls a purse from his coat extracts a coin and holds it out
id pay handsomely for a private showing
are you the proprietor
who sent you
im the owner
he snatches the money
we hear the sound of the padlock being removed
the door opens and light streams in
the canvas covering the windows at the front of the shop obscures all other light
the owner enters followed by treves and the boy
from his expression as well as treves we can tell there must be an awful stench in the room
no one says a word
the boy closes the door while the owner lights a small gas light
we can now see the shop
it it empty grey with dust cold and dank
some old tins and a few shriveled potatoes occupy a shelf
the far end of the shop is blocked off by a curtain suspended from a cord by a few rings
the owner approaches it
here we are sir
ticking it off by rote life is full of surprises
ladies and gentlemen consider the fate of this creatures poor mother
in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was struck down by a wild elephant leering struck down if you take my meaning on an uncharted african isle
the result is plain to see ladies and gentlemen
the terrible elephant the rings rattle back and the curtain is omen
we see a bent figure crouching on a stool covered by a brown blanket
in front of it on a tripod is a large brick heated from below by a bunsen burner
from the blanket protrudes a perfectly normal left arm and hand warming itself over the brick
it does not move when the curtain is drawn
treves steps closer
the owner watching his every move turns and smiles at him
he bangs his riding crop on the wall and yells to the crouched figure as if speaking to a dog
the boy excited by his own fear mimics the owner
the figure comes forward and lets the blanket fall to the ground and we see the elephant man himself
treves his eyes wide with horror and wonder his mouth frozen open steps backward in an instinctive movement of self preservation
the owner laughs
the elephant man is naked to the waist his feet are bare and he wears a pair of worn trousers from a fat mans dress suit
he is a little below average height and looks shorter from the bowing of his back
his head is enormous and misshapen as big around as a mans waist
from his brow projects a huge boney mass almost obscuring his right eye
his nose is a nose of flesh recognizable only from its position
from the upper jaw projects another mass of bone protruding from the mouth like a stump turning the upper lip inside out making a slobbering aperture
it almost gives the impression of a rudimentary trunk or tusk
on top of his head is a handful of lank black hair
at the back of it hangs a bag of spongy skin resembling cauliflower
these loathsome growths cover his back and hang down to the middle of his thighs
the right arm is enormous and shapeless the hand like a knot of tuberous roots
his left arm is not only normal but delicately shaped with fine skin and a hand that any woman might envy
from his chest hangs another bag of flesh like the dewlap of a lizard
his legs are also grossly deformed his feet great stumps
behind him as painted in the portrait are two crudely constructed palm trees
the owner harshly raps again
the elephant man begins to turn
the boy filled with malicious glee at seeing the monster obey screams
the elephant man completes his turn and comes to rest
we see a close up of the elephant man looking at treves
his face is utterly devoid and incapable of expression
we see the elephant mans eyes
he closes them
the owner is locking up
treves facing the street drinks in the fresh air
he is trying to forget his shock put everything into focus
he looks at the garish portrait again
treves produces his purse
the owner smelling money turns
treves hands him several coins
so youll bring him to me tomorrow a
hell be there
ill send a cab
here is my card
treves hands the owner a card
the owner greasy and dirty shakes treves hand and squeezes his arm
now we got a deal
we understand each other
we understand each other completely
the owner gives treves the evil look of a conspirator
treves walks off disoriented
the owner reads the card and smiles at treves walking away down the street
a cabman is knocking on the door of the shop staring at the portrait
the door opens revealing a figure in a floor length black cloak
on his head is an extremely large hat cut to the lines of a yachting cap
a grey flannel curtain hangs from the bottom of the cap all the way around hiding his face
there is a horizontal slit in front for the eyes
on the figures feet are large bag like slippers
the only part of the body seen at all is the left arm and hand which protrudes from the cloak holding a crude walking stick
the figure seems to loathe being in the open
we can just barely see in the darkness within the owner standing to one side of the door obviously enjoying the surprise on the cabmans face
the owner steps abruptly into his view
dont just stand there
help him up
the cabman does so while a small curious crowd forms
the owner gives the cabman the card
the cabman jumps up onto the seat and off they go
the receiving room is a bare hall painted stone color
it has rows of benches and a long desk where entries are made and certificates and other papers are issued
it is a cold harsh place
not at all sir
treves turns and sees the matron staring
ill be in my rooms mothershead
im not to be disturbed
she nods silently
treves looks at the figure for a moment
come with me please
he starts to go out of the room
the hooded figure just stands there motionless
we see the whole room the people now silent
they all stare at the figure
no one makes a move
you heard the doctor
treves turns to look at the hooded figure who stands there a moment then slowly shuffles after him
mothershead and the people in the room watch him go
when he is out of sight they all begin to talk excitedly
mothershead stands fixed and watches too ignoring the noisy room
the door opens and treves leads the hooded figure to a chair in front of his desk and helps him to sit down furtively trying to look into the eye
slit of the mask
in the small room the smell of the elephant man is overwhelming
treves goes to the window and opens it
he nervously tries to compose himself then turns to the hooded figure
my name is frederick treves
i am a surgeon here at the london hospital and i lecture in anatomy at the medical college
i would very much like to examine you
would that be all right
the figure in the chair is still
treves is at a loss
his sense of discomfort is growing
he looks at the floor for a moment then locks his eyes on the figures left arm
um first i would like to ask you a few questions would that be all right
the figure does nothing
treves sits down at his desk and picks up a pencil
now lets see
um the man who
who looks after you tells me that you are english and your name is john merrick
is that correct
the figure does nothing
do you know where you were born
where you come from
the figure does nothing
i tell you what ill ask you a question and you shake your head like this for no and nod like this for yes alright
do you understand
the figure following treves movements nods very slowly yes
treves sighs with relief
are you in any pain
the figure begins to babble incoherently
treves alarmed interrupts
just nod your head like this for yes and shake it like this for no
now are you in any pain
again the figure following treves movements shakes his head no
are your parents still alive
the figure does nothing
treves is quite nervous
do you understand
are they dead
the figure begins to moan
there are two sharp raps at the door
the hooded figure flinches
the door opens and fox pokes his head into the room
freddie what you doing for
i say do open a window in here or
he notices the hooded figure
oh im dreadfully sorry i had no idea that
treves quickly rises and pushes fox out into the hallway following him and closing the door
treves and fox are standing outside the door to treves office
good lord freddie
what have you got in there
youll know presently
at the meeting of the society
but until then i beg of you fox keep it to yourself
certainly if you insist
you must have quite a find there
i dont know what ive got
nothing of any importance eh
treves turns to go back in then stops
ill tell you this much fox its beyond anything you or i have ever dealt with
keep it to yourself please
he goes back in shutting the door
treves turns the key in the door
he turns to the chair the figure had been occupying but he is not there
the figure is hiding in the corner crouched behind a black frock operating coat so stiff with dried blood and pus it stands up by itself
treves looks quickly around the room and finally sees him
he looks at the figure for a moment
come sit down
the frightened figure just crouches there looking at him
treves goes to him pulls him up and over to the chair
the figure sits
treves pauses uncertainly
i think ill examine you now
ill save the questions for later
will you take off your hat now please
the figure does nothing
treves moves to him
dont be frightened i simply want to look at you
do you understand
the figure leans back fearfully
from behind him we see just the top of his wide hooded head
treves standing before him lifts the hood up and back
more to himself thats right dont be frightened
dont be frightened
we see two cameras set up their operators next to them staring at something we cannot see
treves stands beside them concentrating on the same sight
all three are speechless
treves suddenly remembers himself
are you ready
the cameramen mumble yes and gratefully disappear beneath the black cloths of their cameras
they trigger the flash powder
in the blinding flashes we briefly see the silhouette of a tremendously bulky figure starting at the light
as we pull back and down in a slow spiral we see the light is coming through high windows
we now see several rows of distinguished doctors talking to each other in anticipation
as we continue to spiral down we see treves before them at a podium
behind him are two assistants standing beside a curtained stall
treves raps a pointer stick on the podium to bring the meeting to order
we move behind the stall as the assistants part the curtains and we see the silhouette of the elephant man
the doctors talk among themselves quietly
he is english he is twenty one years of age and his name is john merrick
gentlemen in the course of my profession i have come upon lamentable deformities of the face due to injury or disease as well as mutilations and contortions of the body
depending upon like causes but at no time have i met with such a dreaded or perverted version of a human being as this man
i wish to draw your attention to the insidious conditions affecting this patient
note if you will the extreme enlargement of the skull
and upper limb which is totally useless
the alarming curvature of the spine
turn him please
the looseness of the skin and the varying fibrous tumors that cover of the body
treves voice fades as we dissolve to the doctors who at first were rigid and flustered and now bent forward concentrating obviously consumed with interest
spiraling down again we see treves finishing his lecture
and there is every indication that these afflictions have been in existence and have progressed rapidly since birth
the patient also suffers from chronic bronchitis
as an interesting side note in spite of the afore mentioned anomalies the patients genitals remain entirely intact and unaffected
treves nods to the assistants and they go to the elephant man
we see them in shadow untying the loose knot of the loin cloth
close up of the shadow of the head of the elephant man
it goes up for a breath
so then gentlemen owing to this series of deformities the congenital exostoses of the skull extensive papillomatous growths and large pendulous masses in connection with the skin the great enlargement
of the right upper limb involving all the bones the massive distortion of the head and the extensive areas covered by papillomatous growth the patient has been called the elephant man
the elephant man hereafter the e
wearing his cloak is seated by the desk
treves stands behind him measuring his head with calipers
he removes the calipers and notes the span then sets them on the desk
he places the hood over the e
treves sits at his desk and makes some final notes
he becomes more absorbed in his notes than in the e
makes an unintelligible sound
treves only now realizing that the e
has said something looks up at him
treves passes it off as a sigh and turns back to his work
its been a long day for everyone
he closes his notebook and rises
he remembers something
oh yes youll need a cab
to the e
he rises and shuffles slowly about investigating the room
he goes to the desk and begins touching things including the calipers
he notices the card treves gave to the owner tucked in the back pages
he pauses for a moment and then takes the card
his hand disappears into the cloak and he moves back into the corner behind the stiff black operating coat
treves re enters
come with me
takes up his stick and follows treves out
we see treves and fox alone at a window
they are looking down on the hospital square treves had previously crossed and see the e
lit by gaslight and moving to a waiting cab
you never mentioned his mental state
hes imbecile no doubt from birth
he speaks but
its all gibberish
no the mans a homeless idiot
to himself i pray god hes an idiot
as he is getting into the cab stops turns and looks to the upper stories of the hospital
treves and fox are joined by three laughing colleagues who clap treves on the back
quite a coup freddie
youll look splendid in the journal
where ever did you find that creature
from the upper story we watch the cab drive away
its a pity
i pity the poor cab driver myself
from outside the window we see treves surrounded by his laughing friends
we see a door
it opens and treves walks in
he shuts the door locks it goes to a coat rack on the wall and hangs up his overcoat and hat
he notices his reflection in a mirror and examines himself wearily
annes smiling reflection appears beside his
did it go well darling
yes very well i think
are the girls in bed
yes and they send their kisses
would you like your sherry now
no i think a whiskey
we move past annes reflection to a cu of treves
we now see a bunsen burner roar of flame reflected in bytes eyes
pulling back we see bytes quite drunk sitting cooking sausages over the hot brick
he takes another drink from his gin bottle
up comes a wet belch and he takes another drink
is crouched against the wall with a bowl of potatoes and a cup of water in front of him
with his good hand he is picking tiny pieces of potato and feeding himself
the eating is fairly loud and animal like
the drinking is even worse
the boy is across the room asleep wrapped in ragged little blankets
takes a drink of water making a loud smacking slurping sound
bytes looks up from his cooking with a smoldering look just waiting for him to make the sound again
he does and bytes takes his crop and violently jabs him
belt up you misbegotten garbage
mumbling to himself how can i eat with that
bytes takes a mouthful of gin and mockingly slurps it mimicking the e
yelling how can i eat with that
picks and eats some more and then drinks again very tentatively
because of his fear the water catches in his throat and he spits and coughs out onto the floor gasping and wheezing for breath
bytes is up and whacks him with his riding crop
out of my sight
struggles to get up carrying his food
not satisfied with his speed he jabs the e
again spilling his potatoes and water onto the floor
you clumsy sod
he pushes the e
again then slips on the potatoes and falls heavily to the floor crying out in shock
then rage hits him
the boy wakes up in fear
bytes moves quickly toward the e
raising his crop
stumbles and falls backward onto the floor
his head goes back and he begins gasping for air
bytes yanks him up and hits him in the face with his riding crop
the force of the blow knocks a glob of spit into the air from the e
gasps and wheezes horribly as bytes hits him again and again
from across the room
bytes goes right on with the beating
this wont do my lad
this just wont do
we see the eyes of the boy
as we pull back from them they widen with recognition
wide shot of the receiving room
treves has entered and the boy walks quickly up to him
our man is sick
come right away
what is it
he breathes heavily in and out to demonstrate the e
s difficulty ill get my bag
we hear the sound of wheezing coming from the e
who is sitting propped up against the stage wrapped in a blanket
his head bent forward toward his knees
bytes is going to the door as it opens and the boy leads treves in
treves immediately goes to the e
what did you do to him
hes been like this all night
what do you mean
he was fine when he left here and now look at him
i intend to
treves pulls the blanket away from the e
exposing several bruises and bloody cuts
treves freezes at the sight and slowly turns to look at bytes
guardedly he falls
he must have taken quite a fall
he looks up at the riding crop in the hand of bytes then to the strangely nervous and silent boy
hes a clumsy git
never watches where he is going
why is he sitting up like this
he needs rest
thats the way he sleeps
if he lays down hell die
he points to his neck and leans his head back heads too heavy
treves turns his attention to the e
he lifts his head higher and examines the e
who had been oblivious up until this point looks into treves eyes and recognizes him
with his good hand he reaches up and touches treves arm almost as if appealing to him
treves eyes lock on his
this man belongs in hospital
apprehensively cant you fix him up here
hes my livelihood
you listen youre not going to have much of a livelihood if this man dies
hes got the rale hes very weak and i dont know how much damage has been done by his fall
now stop wasting time and fetch a cab
bytes considers and then snaps his fingers at the boy who runs out
he then breaks into an ingratiating grin and leans down over treves who busily examines the wheezing e
i really appreciate this guv
you know theres lot of things that i can do for you
i move in the proper circles for this type of thing
motioning toward the in fact anything at all if you take my meaning
treves uncomfortable rises
bytes grips his hand and with the other gathers the material of his sleeve in a slow deliberate squeeze
i like doing business with you
you and i understand each other completely
i know i can trust you
gazing at him levelly everything will be seen to
through a window we see treves and the e
walking through a back gate and across the square
carr gomm hospital chairman turns and moves away from the window
nurse nora ireland is pushing a cart filled of empty breakfast trays down the hall
she glances into the stairwell and sees treves and the e
coming through the door
she continues on startled by the sight of the mysterious hooded figure
at the end of the hall she goes into the kitchen
treves and the e
are laboriously climbing a flight of stairs
is puffing and wheezing with the effort
treves supports him under his right arm
nora enters with the cart and waits for it to be restocked
she leans out the door for another look but the hall is empty
a nurse ladles mush into bowls
there is a lot of activity in the kitchen
nora takes the cart stacked with full trays and pushes it out the door and down the hallway
treves and the e
cross the hallway and head up a narrow stairway towards the attic
there is a sign reading isolation
carr gomm is leaning out the door to his office unseen by treves
he closes the door
it is a long high ceilinged room with large windows along one wall
beds run the length of both sides of the room
it is a womans ward and nurses are serving the patients breakfast
nora enters and nurses take trays from her cart
noras mind is on what she has just seen
we see mothershead come in the door behind her
startling nora nora
mind your duties
if you dont concentrate dear youll only make more work for the rest of us
now get about your business
pauses seeing noras collar and do get your collar straight dear
fumbling with her collar im so sorry mrs
do get on with it nora
mothershead walks on as nora now very flustered picks up a tray
cu of a bottle of dark fluid and a bottle of light fluid
treves mixes the two in a glass
we are in a small oddly shaped room off the attic ward
there is one tiny barred window located high up on the far wall
there is also a bed two hard chairs and a table
is sitting on the bed in shadow and his disguise is now hanging from a peg on the wall beside him
he is still wheezing and appears to be very weak
treves serves the mixture to the e
who sputters and gags on it but manages to get it down
treves goes to the table and puts the two bottles in his bag
he goes to the door and turns to the i dont know if you will understand this but you will never go back to that man again
youre safe now
no one will ever harm you
do you understand
the two men just look at each other
treves enters the kitchen and nicks up a bowl
a nurse ladles some porridge for him
breakfasting with the patients this morning mr
its for a patient
treves exits and the nurses admiringly watch him go
treves climbs the stairs onto the landing
down the hall mr
carr gomm is walking toward his office
treves tries not to be seen but to no avail
treves come over here a moment wont you
treves hesitates trying to hide the bowl but gives up and goes down the hall to meet carr gomm
good morning treves
good morning sir
seeing the bowl youve acquired a taste for this
its quite nutritious sir
dont be mad
this muck can kill you
carr gomm calls a nurse from a nearby ward over
it is nora
he takes the bowl from treves and hands it to her
take this up to to the man in the isolation ward when you have a moment wont you
apprehensively yes sir
dont be frightened
he wont hurt you
he gestures toward his office door
as he and treves enter the office nora looks apprehensively up the isolation ward stairs
it is a small elegantly furnished room with a large window
the two men sit carr gomm behind his desk and treves in a leather chair
a hospital is no place for secrecy mr
doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment
why wasnt this patient properly admitted and why is he in isolation
is he contagious
no sir hes got bronchitis and hes been badly beaten
why isnt he in the general ward then
well sir hes quite seriously deformed and i fear the other patients would find him
is that it
then am i to assume that he is ultimately incurable
what are your plans then treves
you are aware that the london does not accept incurables
the rules are quite clear on that point
yes im well aware of that
but this case is quite exceptional
oh is he a friend of yours
no more of an acquaintance
a the e
is asleep in his sleeping posture on the bed
b nora with the bowl is climbing the stairs to the attic ward
she pauses in sight of the door and looks apprehensively at it
she begins to hum to give herself courage and continues up the stairs
a the e
awakens hears the footsteps and now the humming which grows in volume
he becomes fearful and reaches for his cloak
the humming stops
he freezes and listens
c treves and carr gomm seated as before
i certainly sympathize with your problem treves
why dont you try the british home or the royal hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him
yes sir ill look into that
he rises would you like to meet him sir
b nora stands outside the door listening
she is barely breathing
a the e
still listening slowly lets his hand drop away from the cloak
b nora opens the door
a the e
grabs for the cloak as the door swings open flooding him with light
we see him for the first time in his entirety
cu of nora screaming and dropping the tray
cu of the caught e
c the shrill scream is heard from upstairs
excuse me sir
treves rushes out
carr gomm just sits for a moment thinking
the elephant man
treves rushing up the stairs reaches the landing
nora is at the railing crying
the door is open the breakfast tray littering the floor
is on the bed trying to squeeze into the corner
treves quickly closes the door and tries to comfort nora
im sorry my dear i should have warned you
im so terribly sorry please forgive me
there youre alright now
go downstairs and please ask mrs
mothershead to come up
tell her to knock on the door and wait for me
im sorry sir
drying her eyes she goes downstairs
closing the door treves steps over the spilt breakfast and goes to the e
im very sorry about that
are you resting well
makes a garbled sound
treves alone with the e
once more finds himself becoming uncomfortable
oh yes well have to get you some more food
im sure you must be simply famished
of course you are
now then i think youll be quite comfortable up here for awhile
ill see to it you have everything you need and uh
treves puts out a comforting hand to the e
who flinches back
the two men just look at each other
several nurses are taking bath things off a cart
at the other end of the room mothershead is talking to a patient
nora enters and walks over to mothershead
they talk and mothershead exits
nora joins the other nurses
did you see him
whats wrong with him
we see noras face
she is silent
mothershead knocks on the door
treves opens it comes out onto the landing and closes the door
how are you feeling today
now then mrs
mothershead i want you to come into this room with me
inside there is a man with a rather
well i want you to clear up a little mess a breakfast tray was spilt
and bring up another breakfast
when youve done that you and i shall give the man a bath
but mothershead im counting on your many years of experience to get you through this above all do not scream do not cry out or in any way show this
man that you are frightened of him
sir you dont have to worry about me
im not the sort to cry out
shall we go in
yes lets go in
treves opens the door
mothershead goes right to the mess
to the e
hereafter merrick i would like you to meet mrs
merrick looks up to mothershead then averts his eyes
he looks back at her and sees she has no difficulty being in his presence
how do you do
at the door of merricks attic room stand two buckets of very dirty water
we hear footsteps coming up stairs and see a young porter carrying two buckets of clean steaming water
he puts them down knocks on the door and takes the dirty water downstairs
the door opens mrs
mothershead picks up the steaming buckets and takes them inside shutting the door
merricks seated in a tin bathtub trying to hide his nakedness
mothershead pours the water in
she scrubs his back with obvious distaste but does her job
months of filth and accumulated excrescence are turning the bath water a murky black
as mothershead scrubs merrick slowly leans forward in the bath closing his eyes apparently oblivious to his surroundings
treves sits beside him
the disease is shocking
merricks eyes flicker
i wonder how far it can go before it
merrick flinches and pulls away
dont wiggle about like a pup
i wont stand for any foolishness
treves leans forward and looks at merrick
merrick grows still his eyes closed apparently in a reverie
its pretty certain that if he had the disease as a child he was abandoned
but in that case hed have to have had care
the very fact that hes alive bears that out
cut to treves but where
merrick is listening
at this word merrick begins to babble wildly
obviously alarmed he thrashes about in the tub spilling water onto the floor
treves alarmed now himself attempts to calm merrick who still babbling tries to rise from the tub
mothershead clamps a hand on merricks left arm
at her touch he is instantly subdued at least physically
he sinks back into the tub and begins to weep
treves and mothershead are astounded by the tears rolling down merricks cheeks
they stand motionless looking down at the agonized naked elephant man
softly the workhouse
the young porter is exiting with great difficulty through a large iron door carrying the two buckets
he sets one of the buckets down takes the other and splashes it out into the alley
some thick sludge dribbles from the empty bucket
unseen by him the night porter is standing just to the side and he now comes forward
the young porter seems nervous in his presence
the night porter looks at his spattered shoes then up to the young porter
whats all this then
treves is scrubbing his elephant man
i hear its a real horror
even made mothershead scream
friend of the night eh
the elephant man
i think ill have me a look at that
suddenly the night porter kicks the other bucket of filthy water violently sending it splashing all over the young porter
now you need the scrubbing ducks
he lets his cigarette drop to the ground then stamps and grinds it with his brass heeled boot all the while smiling
then he turns on his heel and leaves
dark clouds rolling through an evening sky
through the high barred window we see the dark sky
is on his bed in his sleeping posture
a dim gaslight burns in the room
close up of his head on the points of his knees
his breathing is more regular now
lights are being turned off
lights go off
large iron door is closed
half the lights go off
nurses leave for their quarters half the lights go off
we hear the slow metallic footfalls of the night porters boots
he appears and walks into a darkened womens ward
the women are all asleep
some coughing fitfully others moaning quietly
the night porter walks down the aisle between the beds
we see several of the sleeping women as he passes them
finally he comes to a young beautiful woman her eyes wide open watching him with intense fear
on either side of her are two very ancient women snoring deeply
the young woman has her arms tied suspended in traction above her
the night porter moves to her his shadow engulfing her
she starts to move rattling the apparatus above her
the porter puts a finger to his lips
hush love i told you before one word from me theyll toss you back on the street and then those pretty little arms of yours will never grow straight
now close your eyes
she turns her head away closing her eyes
he moves in
close up of a gas light in a hallway
the leaping flame makes a low roar
somewhere a door is opened and the squeak sounds vaguely like the trumpeting of an elephant
we hear again the metallic footfalls of the night porters boots and he appears
he goes to the narrow stairway marked isolation
he stops and casually looks about
he takes a swig of his gin then starts up the stairs
merrick as before the light is very dim
we hear the echoing footfalls of the night porter coming up the stairs
merricks head immediately comes up from his knees
as it does a small object falls from where his head rested
he picks it up and puts it in a pocket of his cloak
it is the portrait of the beautiful woman which he saw in his dream
suddenly the door swings open and the night porter bottle in hand is standing there
he walks into the room and sees merricks shape on the bed
here he is the old fiend of the night the terror of the london
lets have a look at you
lets see what makes em scream
he turns up the light and sees merrick clearly
the night porter jumps back awe struck
merrick is trembling
the night porter hardly able to believe his eyes moves slowly toward merrick
he is afraid but as he reaches the bed merrick flinches back
the night porter grins his fear gone now
he is in control
so this is the elephant man
i aint never seen nothing like you before
what the bleedin hell happened to you
merrick cowers as far away from the night porter as possible
he takes a big swallow of the gin and smiles
i likes people what can keep quiet
he offers merrick his bottle with a swift almost jabbing motion
merrick pulls away from him
like a drink
go on have some
you should try being more sociable mate
he tentatively presses the bottom of the bottle up against the hanging growth on merricks chest
encouraged he touches him with his fingers
merrick makes a small whimpering sound
grinning you and i are going to be good friends we are
and ive got lots of friends who i know would like to meet you
and they will mate
he moves to the door and turns
close up of night porters face
welcome to the london
he moves out the door and it closes
in the bed merrick looks at the door with terror as the heavy footfalls of the night porter recede down the stairs
we see a horses head in cu snorting steam into the chill morning air
the horse is harnessed to a milk wagon parked in front of the london
through the open back of the wagon we see the milkman and past him treves walking towards us
here early again eh mr
if you dont mind my saying so sir with your early habits youd a made a fine milkman
good morning charley
ill keep that in mind
treves walks up the path into the hospital
treves carrying a bowl crosses the upper hall and starts to the narrow stairway to the isolation ward
over his shoulder we see him knock twice on the door
as the door swings open the camera pushes past him and we see the room
the lamp is still burning but merrick is nowhere to be seen
treves enters looking about for him
theres movement in the corner beside the bed
merrick rises slightly from the shadow
the light from the lamp hits his frightened eyes
ive brought your breakfast
treves is unsettled by the sight of merrick cowering down on the floor
merrick begins to babble
treves enters the room placing the bowl on the table and going to merrick
what are you doing down there
come up john come up on the bed
the cold floor is bad for you
i wont hurt you come on now
he helps merrick up onto the bed and goes back to the table for the bowl
you must eat
we must keep your strength
he has turned back to the bed but merrick has slipped to the floor again still trying to hide himself in the corner
what on earth is the matter with you
he puts the bowl down again and goes back to merrick who seems very upset at leaving his hiding place
now please john you must do as i say
come up from there
he starts to help merrick up but merrick just presses himself farther back in the corner still babbling
there are two raps at the door
treves goes to it and lets mothershead in
good morning mr
itll be his bath time soon
has he eaten
not quite yet mrs
there seems to be some difficulty this morning
they both look at the bed
merrick has almost disappeared under it
wont come out eh
no hes very upset about something
just being obstinate sir
ill handle it
she goes to merrick and takes hold of his left wrist
alright my son none of this fuss
come up from there this instant
she starts to force him up from the floor
merrick is moaning now still trying to get away
dont pull at him like that
we dont want to frighten him more than he already is
by this time mothershead has almost got him back on the bed
honestly sir you must be very firm with this sort
otherwise theyd lay about on the floor gibbering all day long
all he understands is a good smack
they help merrick settle back on the pillow
merrick is still making desperate unintelligible sounds
hes had his share of smacks mothershead
i expect thats what drives him under the bed
we must use patience and understanding with this man
perhaps youve got the time for that mr
treves i certainly dont
ive got an entire hospital to look after and you have your real patients
dont waste your time with him sir its like talking to a wall
i dont mean to be harsh but truthfully what can you do for him
ill be back later for his bath
carr gomm would like to see you when you have a moment
good day sir
treves shuts the door behind her and turns back to the bed
to himself what good am i to you
he goes to the bed and sits down in front of merrick angered by his own seeming uselessness in the situation
what is my purpose
its so important that i understand you
i want to help you i want to be your doctor
directly to merrick but i cant help you unless you help me unless i know what you are feeling
i believe theres something back there theres something you want to say but ive got to understand you
do you understand me
merrick hesitates then starts babbling again
you are going to talk to me
we are going to show them
were going to show them that youre not a wall
we are going to talk
do you understand
nod your head if you understand me
slowly merrick nods yes
you do understand me
now youre going to say it
ive got to hear how you say things
now very slowly say yes
treves carefully mouths the word
merrick is still hesitant from years of fear but his eyes betray a growing excitement
slowly he tries to talk his voice a tremulous whisper
grabbing merricks arm yes john
throughout their dialogue merrick is still very garbled but he no longer babbles
he makes a great effort to speak slowly to form words the way treves forms them to be understood
thats much better
i could understand that yes
im going to say some things to you and i want you to repeat them
i want you to say them back to me
do you understand
im going to say some things to you and i want you to say them back to me
do you understand
my name is
merrick say merrick
well thats alright
i understand you
now say the whole thing again hello
my name is
mothershead comes out of the kitchen with a supper tray and walks down the hall passing the open ward door
we see nurses serving patients their supper
nora comes out of the ward with a tray which she holds tightly against her
a bowl of soup is spilling on her apron
she catches up with mothershead
they speak as they walk
mothershead please forgive my behavior yesterday
im sorry if youre having to do extra work on my account
it was just seeing it
patients here are not its
they are either hes or shes but thats alright ireland
this ones going to be more work for all of us
good god girl
mind your broth
mothershead continues on
nora guiltily watches her go
treves and merrick are absorbed in their work
a knock comes at the door
why my dear mrs
mothershead how good of you to join us
merrick will you please introduce yourself
hesitantly hello my name is john merrick
good lord mr
exuberantly weve made tremendous strides today mothershead
he listens and repeats with great attention and this certainly isnt easy for him
parrots can do as much mr
its all very nice but i dont see the point
you know they wont let him stay here
lowering his voice im sure that if mr
merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee theyd see that hes the exception to their rule
now im not expecting miracles
im not saying hell be able to read or write but i do think that i can get him to speak for himself
im going to arrange things with carr gomm right now
to merrick that was very good john very good
thats all for today
we shall do some more tomorrow
mothershead sets the tray down beside merrick
ill see you soon
he and mothershead exit
merrick watches the door close
he sighs quietly looks about and sees the bible on the bedside table
he picks it up and gently runs his fingers over the cover
there is total pandemonium in the receiving room
the room is filled with screaming men women and children
two drunken women have been fighting with broken bottles and are now covered with blood and cuts
the women are still hysterical one minute theyre sobbing then in an instant screaming and intent upon fighting again
the crowd keeps them apart
two bobbies stand in the background making no move to intercede
to the side we see bytes watching everything
it is still too violent a scene for the nurses to come to the womens aide and they stand up in the front of the room waiting
bytes makes his way along the side of the crowd waiting for a chance to get behind the nurses and on into the hospital
now the women begin sobbing again and things quiet some
the nurses come forward into the crowd
bytes moves over closer to the hallways
when the nurses have all gone into the crowd he seizes the chance and disappears into the hospital
bytes appears and walks down hospital hallway looking about
the door opens and treves enters
treves sits in the armchair
carr gomm is sitting at his desk
have you contacted the british home and the royal hospital
ah no sir
i had planned to see them in the morning
how is the patient
hes doing very well
in fact thats why i came to see you
i think that if i were to present mr
merrick to the hospital committee then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease but of the man as well
if the committee had a chance to speak with him hear him say a few words for himself im sure they would see him as a patient rather than as
a violation of the rules
a few words
i thought he was imbecile
well sir perhaps i should explain
i really dont think thats necessary treves
im quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case such as they are
i dont agree
no one can make a reasonable decision about this mans future without at least meeting him
no doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met
no treves its out of the question
now if it was up to me id say certainly lets meet the fellow by all means im sorry i simply cant speak for the other members of the committee
then will you meet him as a representative of the committee
treves its out of the question
i want to hear as soon as possible what the other hospitals can do
we see treves leave carr gomms office and walk toward us to the stairwell
as treves begins down the stairs he sees bytes on the next landing coming up
bytes spots him and goes toward him
i want my man back
just a moment how did you get in here
never mind that i want my man
hes still very sick
please come downstairs with me
ill explain the situation
dont muck me about
youve had plenty of time to fix him up and hes leaving with me now
do you understand me
we had a bargain
this man suffered a severe fall if you take my meaning
hes my patient now and i must do what
pull the other one why dont you
we made a deal
i know what youve done to him and hes never going back to that
hes a freak
thats how they live
were partners him and i business partners
youre willfully deprivin me of my livlihood
all you do is profit from another mans misery
you think youre better n me
you wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself you guv
so i gave him to you
on trust in the name of science
and now i want him back
you dont own this man
i want him back
so you can beat him
so you can starve him
a dog in the street would fare better with you
ive got my rights damn you and im going to the authorities
well go to the authorities
now we see carr gomm standing above them at the top of the stairs
by all means do so
in fact ill fetch them myself
im quite sure theyd be very interested in your story as well as ours
livid bytes looks from carr gomm to treves at a loss for words
now i think we really do understand one another
he backs slowly down to the landing eyeing treves and carr gomm
at the landing he casually turns and disappears down more stairs
treves turns and gazes at carr gomm
singularly unpleasant chap
i dont suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your
gratefully thank you very much sir
shall we say in a few days then
shall we say two oclock tomorrow afternoon
slightly taken aback wh
whatever is most convenient for you sir
two oclock then
you know treves
it seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance
they part company
we follow treves down the stairs
muttering two oclock
then we follow carr gomm to his office door
he stops short
mumbling out loud elephant man
i dont want to meet an elephant man
again the hospital is closing down for the night
lights go off in each hallway
the staff is vacating the hospital
as the last light goes off we hear the great iron door slam shut
anne is at her dressing table brushing out her hair
she is in a very flattering dressing gown ready to turn in
we see her reflected in the mirror as well as treves who is in his robe in the background seated at his side of their bed deep in thought
anne looks at treves and smiles affectionately
getting no response she renews her efforts
freddie dont look so discouraged
i shouldnt be
we made great progress today
i taught him to repeat a few basic phrases
he did rather well too but i had to lead him every step of the way
though frankly at times i was unsure of who was leading whom
what do you mean
well i wasnt sure whether he was parroting me because thats all he was capable of or whether he sensed that thats all i wanted to hear and he was
trying to please me
but i thought you said that he was rather
i mean ive always thought he was
i think he must be
is he simple
or is that just something ive wished upon him to make things simpler for myself
anne puts down the brush and rises
frederick why are you so interested in this particular case
i dont know
i cant explain it
if this is an intelligent man trapped in the body of a monster then im under a moral obligation to help free that mind free that spirit as best i
can to help him live as full and content a life as possible
if hes an imbecile whos body i cant treat and whos mind i cant touch well then my obligation is discharged
they can put him where they will he wont be bothered i wont be bothered and everyones conscience can remain free and untroubled
and that is my dilemma
what is in his mind
anne sympathizing with his concerns goes to him and puts her arms around him
perhaps youre just polishing a stone endowing this elephant man with qualities he doesnt possess
impatiently and what qualities are those
intelligence or stupidity
slightly hurt im sure i dont know freddie
she releases treves and lies down
treves realizes that perhaps he has been unkind
i dont know either
i just dont know
well these things take time
ive only got until two oclock tomorrow afternoon when carr gomm meets him
somehow between now and then ive got to make john merrick at least seem like an intelligent man
why am i fooling myself
nothing short of john delivering the sermon on the mount is going to sway carr gomm
anne sits back up and gently places her hand over treves mouth
as she does so she leans forward and turns out the light
merrick is propped up in bed
suddenly the door bursts open
the night porter an arm around a drunken giggling tart stands in the doorway
as soon as the charwoman sees merrick she screams as does merrick and she wriggles free making for the stairs
the night porter watches her go and then turns to merrick laughing noisily
he then pulls the door shut with a bang
merrick very frightened crawls down into his hiding place
we see anne alone in bed asleep
treves is finished dressing and leaves the room
the sound of the door closing awakens anne
she looks around for treves
a clock reads
merricks disguise hangs on the wall
the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside still waters
he restoreth my soul he guideth me in the paths of righteousness
righteousness for his namesake
very good very good
now when your visitor comes today i want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now
i will introduce him to you and you will say the words youve learned
if you have any trouble with any of the words ill help you
im sure youll be just fine
if you do as well for him as youve done for me these last two days then im sure our visitor will be very pleased
now lets go through the whole thing again shall we
i will say may i introduce you to mr
and you will say
hello my name is john merrick
i am very pleased to meet you
treves and carr gomm are speaking together as they walk along
its only a physical problem
he has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth
but he can talk and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him
so if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying just tell me and ill make it clear
speaking is one thing treves but can the man comprehend
treves cannot easily answer this question
as i said its only a physical problem
but i do feel that mr
merrick is very flattered that youre taking the time and trouble to meet him and hes most anxious to make a good impression so he might seem rather nervous
i have no desire to cause him any discomfort
did you make those inquiries we spoke about
yes i spoke to both the british home and royal hospital for incurables
im afraid that they werent very encouraging but they said theyd bring it up at their next committee meeting so we should have their answers shortly
you know your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing treves
but you must remember that this is a hospital and there are many patients here
patients who can be made well and you owe them your first consideration
just dont become so obsessed old man that you begin to neglect them
carr gomm starts up the stairs
treves remains behind watching him for a moment then follows
merrick is standing beside his disguise on its hook
he nervously smooths the cloak down repositions the bible on the bedside table and smooths the cloak again
he looks at the door expecting it to open
his hands smooths the cloak over and over again
voices can be heard outside the door
there are two raps at the door
merrick flinches clutching the cloak
the raps are repeated
he pulls himself together and walks to the middle of the room
he takes a deep breath and closes his eyes
the door opens and treves and carr gomm enter
carr gomms eyes are rivited on merrick but he contains his shock
merrick is breathing unevenly his eyes still closed
treves goes to him and touches his shoulder
merrick opens his eyes and looks up at treves
treves turns to carr gomm as does merrick
carr gomm lowers his eyes
john may i introduce you to sir carr gomm
my name is john merrick
i am very pleased to meet you
carr gomm still shaken instinctively offers his hand
pleased to meet you
before carr gomm can withdraw his hand merrick grasps it with his left hand
there is an uncomfortable silence
merrick releases it
carr gomn nervously clears his throat
how are you feeling today
i feel much better
thank you for asking
im feeling very fit thank you
how is your bronchitis
i feel much better
are you comfortable here
everyone has been very kind
i am extremely grateful
merrick likes the food here
dont you john
it is much better than what i am used to
after a pause and what was that john
there is another agonizing silence
to carr gomm yes potatoes
but the variety of food here is very pleasing
i commend you
after a pause i understand that you were beaten
merrick is at a loss
this is not part of the expected scenario
oh no everyone has been very kind
no i meant in your former situation
merrick doesnt seem to understand
im feeling much better now
carr gomm stares levelly at treves for a moment then asks merrick tell me how do you like mr
as a teacher
everyone has been very kind to me
how long did you and mr
treves prepare for this interview
merrick looks at treves for guidance but treves cannot look him in the eye
everyone has been very kind
yes of course
well its been a pleasure meeting you mr
to john thank you john
you did very well
treves and carr gomm go out the door onto the landing
merrick sees his chance escaping him and tries to recapture their attention
his voice is gaining strength the lord is my shepherd i shall not want
he maketh me to lie down in green pastures
he continues through the following dialogue treves and carr gomm are alone on the landing speaking quietly
it was a nice try treves but the man is so obviously mouthing your words
yes im very sorry to have wasted your time sir
i just felt that i had to do anything i could to protect him
im sorry too
he simply doesnt belong here
hes be much happier somewhere else where he could be constantly looked after
believe me frederick its better that it worked out this way
merrick has come to the end of what treves taught him to say
he makes one last desperate attempt to be heard
treves disheartened stands on the landing as carr gomm starts down the stairs
now full voice yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff
they comfort me
treves is staring open mouthed back into the room
carr gomm looks up at him
what is it treves
thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil
i didnt teach him that part
treves rushes back into the room followed by carr gomm
my cup runneth over
surely goodness and loving kindness shall follow me all the days of my life and i shall dwell in the house of the lord forever
there is a long silence as all three men stare at each other
how did you know the rest
i never taught you the rest of it
i dont understand
tell me john how did you know the rest of the rd psalm
i used to read the bible every day
i know it very well
the bible and the book of common prayer
the rd psalm is very beautiful
a few minutes later
we hear voices inside the room
it was a great pleasure to meet you mr
i am very pleased to meet you
i hope we can talk together again sometime
the door opens and carr gomm and treves come out
to merrick ill be right back
he closes the door
i want to see you in my office as soon as youre through up here
weve a good deal to discuss
he starts down the stairs
of course sir
thank you thank you very much
carr gomm stops on the stairs
not me sir
he succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness
merrick is on the bed propped up by pillows
the door opens
treves comes in shuts the door and leans against it
they look at each other for a moment
why did you let me go on like that teaching you what you already knew
why didnt you tell me you could read
you did not ask me
i never thought to ask
how can you ever forgive me
oh no do not say that
you have been so kind to me
i was afraid to say too much
people always want me to be quiet
you wanted me to speak but i was afraid
we do have a lot to talk about dont we
carr gomm is seated at the window looking out silently
there is a knock at the door and treves enters
he quietly closes the door and walks to the window
carr gomm never moves
can you imagine what his life has been like
yes i think i can
no you cant
you cant begin to know no one can
carr gomm suddenly stands and faces treves
you are quite right treves this is an exceptional case
and i quite agree that the committee should see mr
i could easily arrange
no not that way
broadneck and the others dont like to deal with patients directly
it makes them queasy
do you have any photographs of mr
we shall present them along with the other particulars of the case to the committee
i want them to see exactly how horribly his body has been affected
you and i shall vouch for his inner qualities
do you think theyll go along with us
of course they will
theyre reasonable men
merrick is in bed very tired
its been an exhausting day
suddenly the door opens and mothershead comes into the room
merrick looks up at her very apprehensively
she walks over to the bed picks up the bible from the table opens it and hands it to merrick
merrick looks down at the bible
thou heardest my voice hide not thine ear at my breathing at my cry
mothershead backs slowly to the door deeply disturbed
she stares at merrick for a moment
credit where credit is due
youll have the paper every morning at breakfast
she quickly turns and exits
merrick looks down at the bible
it is open to lamentations
as before the lights are going off in one hallway after another
the hallways are empty dark and silent
we hear the great iron door close with a bang
merrick is in his bed as always
he holds the portrait of the beautiful woman gazing at it longingly
he hears a door close far away in the silence of the hospital
suddenly we hear the heavy footfalls of the night porters boots
as they get louder and louder we move slowly closer to merricks face
the sound is very close now and merricks eyes are visibly agitated
finally the door bursts open and the night porter is standing there
he stares malevolently at merrick for a long moment and then walks to him menacingly
i hear you have some trouble sleepin
he grabs merrick fiercely by the hair and jerks his head back
merrick immediately starts to wheeze and gasp
heads too heavy eh
he pulls merrick all the way down onto the bed so that he is prone struggling for breath
and i heard a nasty rumor about you i heard you can talk but you cant can you
the night porter is as first surprised and then pleased at the desperate sound
no you cant
one word about me out of that stinking cakehole
just one word and youll have no trouble at sleepin
no trouble at all
you understand me
satisfied the night porter rights merrick who is just able to catch his breath
the night porter smiles and pats merrick on the shoulder
there now thats better in it
treves and carr gomm are on their way to the committee meeting confident of their position
treves is holding a folder and carr gomm is looking at the photographs of merrick
as far as i can see the only obstacle might be broadneck
he has enormous influence over the others very old school not an easy man to impress
in any case if worse does come to worse we still have the british and royal homes to fall back on dont we
treves is silent
no we dont
their committees have informed me that theyre unwilling to take mr
merrick even if they were supplied with funds
they dont want him
well its up to us then isnt it
they continue walking
dont worry treves well make them see it our way
he looks at the pictures
theyve eyes havent they
they go through a door marked committee room
we see a pair of hands
one of the photographs of merrick is passed to them
they hold it for a moment then lay it down flat on the table
one of the hands covers the photograph with a piece of paper
due to the progressive nature of the disease i feel sure that the patient does not have much longer to live
we pan up from the hands to see broadneck his face pinched with disgust
he sniffs and gazes coolly at treves
forgive the redundancy gentlemen but there is no other place for him
both the royal hospital and the british home have turned him down even if sufficient funds for his care were provided
the workhouse is certainly out of the question
the patient has an overwhelming fear of returning to the horrors of his past
his appearance is so disturbing that all shrink from him
he cannot in justice to others be put in the general ward of the workhouse
the police rightly prevent his being exhibited and he is mobbed in the streets wherever he goes
what is to be done with him
i for one am sick and tired of this competitive freak hunting by these overly ambitious young doctors trying to make names for themselves
to parade then about in front of the pathological society is one thing but to waste this committees valuable time with requests for shelter for these abominations of nature is
gentlemen john merrick is not an animal he is a man fully aware of his condition
an intelligent sensitive literate man with an intimate knowledge of the bible
his horrible infirmities do not reduce him to anything less than what he is a man and it would be criminal if we of the london hospital his final refuge
the last place on earth where this man can find peace were to cast him out
carr gomm from his chair on the committee pounds his gavel
gentlemen may i make a suggestion
there are two small rooms off bedstead square that are no longer in use and would be admirably suited to mr
i also propose to write a letter to the times appealing to their readers for assistance
knowing the generosity of the british public i feel we would have little trouble in raising the funds for his maintenance
indeed this hospitals rules do preclude the admission of incurables but if ever there was an exception to the rule it is this patient
so therefore i propose if mr
treves is finished that we put it to a vote
all those in favor of keeping mr
carr gomm and another committee member raise their hands
broadneck is displeased
one moment showing the picture of merrick as far as im concerned this creature has no business being in our hospital
i think mr
carr gomms letter would be an excellent idea to carr gomm and when you appeal for funds i think you should appeal for a more appropriate place for him as
i agree the british public is generous and im sure that somewhere the creature will find a happy and permanent home but not here
one of the committee members says i quite agree
carr gomm scowls a bit
all then that move we keep mr
carr gomm raises his hand
none of the others do
treves and carr gomm exchange hopeless glances
carr gomm looks at the man who had originally raised his hand
he looks away ashamed
all those opposed
broadneck and the rest raise their hands
triumphantly well then
in the meantime of course he neednt be turned out
he may stay in the rooms off bedstead square until such time as more suitable arrangements can be made thus freeing the isolation ward for more deserving patients
well then mr
chairman if there is nothing further to discuss i move that we adjourn this meeting and all go bout our normal business
carr gomm cannot conceal his contempt
i second the motion gentlemen
this meeting is adjourned
the others cough their agreement and hurriedly leave the room
treves walks over to the committee table and takes the paper off the photograph
he stares sadly at merricks picture
somehow i dont think they quite understand
we see a very lovely woman seated in a chair before a mirror
she is reading aloud from the times
her hair is being brushed by a young girl
terrible though his appearance is so terrible indeed that women and nervous persons fly in terror from the sight of him and that he is debarred from seeking to earn
his livelihood in any ordinary way yet he is superior in intelligence can read and write is quiet gentle not to say even refined in his mind
she turns to the girl thoughtfully
id very much like to meet that gentleman
he sounds almost shakespearean
the room is elegantly furnished and heavily carpeted
the walls are panelled in richly gleaming walnut with finely wrought brass lamps spaced regularly along their length
in the center of the room is a long oak table with a fine linen table cloth around which sits a number of doctors among them fox
some of them are still eating
a waiter is clearing away a few plates and several doctors are helping themselves to port wine kept in decanters in the center of the table and to cigars in
one of them is reading the times
at one end of the table sits treves picking at his food
in life until he came under the kind care of the nursing staff of the london hospital and the surgeon who has befriended him
good publicity for the hospital at any rate
treves comes off well too eh freddie
it was pleasant of you to join us this evening frederick
your elephant man dining out this evening
i understand the kitchen ran out of hay this morning
the group laughs
slightly sourly do continue reading mr
it is a case of singular affliction brought about through no fault of himself he can but hope for quiet and privacy during a life which mr
treves assures me is not likely to be long there is a short pause
the elephant man
makes you sound rather more like a zoo keeper than a surgeon frederick
the group again laughs
treves clears his throat and rises
excuse me gentlemen
i seem to have lost my appetite
treves leaves the room
i say whats he on about
hes getting a bit of a swelled head if you ask me
coldly well no one did ask you atkins
frederick treves is not only the most skillful surgical operator here hes also a humanitarian of the highest order
you sound like a pack of whining school boys with your petty jealousies
look here fox i simply said
oh belt up
a deep silence falls over the doctors
we see a small very dusty dirty room filled with boxes and bedsteads and other things stored over the years
the one grimy window is locked shut
the door opens and two middle aged charwomen enter
they look around at the room with distaste and drop their mops and buckets
there are cleaner rooms in the gasworks
she reaches into her apron pocket and pulls out a pint bottle of gin
she takes a drink and passes it to her friend
whos all the fuss for then
wiping her mouth dont you know
its for that strange one
treves elephant man
i hear hes got a trunk
the st woman takes the bottle and walks across the room
she forces open the balky window and sits on the sill
blimey now were cleanin up for circus animals
the st woman laughing takes another healthy swig from the bottle
we see past her through the window the dark silhouette of the main spire of st
philips cathedral against the sky
it fills the screen
merrick sitting on his bed hunched over in concentration reading an illustrated london news
he is staring at a picture of the eddystone lighthouse
reading softly a silent shaft of stone on a deserted promontory the lonely eddystone is a beacon of aid and comfort to mariners of all nations
he looks at the picture silently
there is a knock at the door
merrick says come in
treves enters holding a book
how are you feeling
very well thank you
very well thank you
i have something for you john
im sure youll enjoy it its very popular
he holds the book out to him
its an alice in wonderland
surprised thank you
oh its beautiful
he lovingly feels the leather binding and looks at treves with speechless gratitude
merrick carefully opens the book to a colored frontpiece the picture of alice grown too large for a hallway looking imploringly at the dwarfed white rabbit
the caption reads
curiouser and curiouser
he leafs through the pages looking at the other illustrations as treves delighted with the gifts effect looks on
i came to tell you that ill be here early tomorrow morning
were moving you to your permanent home
im sure youll be very happy there john
so get a good nights rest therell be new people to meet tomorrow
treves smiles broadly and exits
weakly good night
treves words have disturbed merrick
he sinks into the pillows the book before him
we see the picture of the mock turtle perched upon his rock great tears rolling down his cow like face as alice and the gryphon look on with intense sympathy
merrick looks up at his disguise hanging on the wall
the night porter enters and saunters over to the noisy crowd
as they welcome him he slaps down the times on the bar counter for all to see
listen to this
this is a letter to the london times from the guvnor of the hospital
starts to read there is now in a little room off one of our attic wards a man named john merrick so dreadful a sight that he is unable even
to come out by daylight to the garden
he has been called the elephant man on account of his terrible deformity
the night porter has the undivided attention of the people in the pub
his appearance is so terrible that woman and nervous persons fly in terror at the sight of him
pauses and guess who can get you tickets to see him
your own sunny jim
lets go see him then
keep your shirts on
shaking his finger at them when the time is right
right now hes in the attic but tomorrow theyre movin him into bedstead square right into my lap
for the right price youll see something youll never see again in your life
he lifts his glass to his lips
we move back to see bytes boys who having heard the night porters words slips unnoticed from the pub
merrick in his disguise and treves one arm around him are walking together
merrick seems very uneasy
a nurse on duty early or late getting off passes them
she stares at the hooded figure
they continue on in silence
the room is now spotless
it is furnished with a bed and the required pillows a small table and chair by the window now curtained
adjoining this room is a smaller one which contains a bathtub
merrick enters and looks around confused
treves stands in the doorway
merrick turns to him
this is your new home john
merrick pulls off his hood
his eyes are bewildered
is my new home
incredulous the hospital
what did you think
merricks eyes glisten with held back tears
he lowers them
almost sobbing how long will i stay here
i promise you
you will never see the inside of that horrible place again
you will never ever go back to the workhouse
or that man
its a splendid room dont you think
merrick inspects his new home
he seems pleased by the bathtub by the table by the window to the outside world
merrick pulls the curtain aside and opens the window
he looks out and then up with a small intake of breath
before him beyond the hospital fence the spire of st
phillips cathedral stands resplendently in the morning light
when im next moved may i go to a lighthouse
or to a blind asylum
we see carr gomm walking to his office
he is met at the door by an anxious treves
has the response picked up
frankly treves its not what id expected
a few small cheques
dont worry these things undoubtedly take time
but hes so afraid hes going to be carted off
ive promised him that wont happen
ill let you know if theres something in the afternoon post
carr gomm goes back into his office and treves walks off
there is no one in the room
the bathroom door opens and nora and another nurse enter carrying buckets which they set down by the hall door
they straighten up and lean back against it
mothershead enters from the bathroom speaking over her shoulder to merrick
well i think i can safely hand the duties over to you girls now
merrick will require a bath every day
that way he wont pong quite so much
nora you can instruct kathleen on the finer points of mr
youll be on your own tomorrow
the girls try to keep bright faces
dont look so glum girls
such enthusiastic volunteers should be more cheerful
mothershead starts to exit
oh and girls under no circumstances are there to be any mirrors brought into this room
ugly or not youre going to help me
merrick quietly enters the room dressed in a billowy white shirt and baggy black pants
the two nurses try to smile but he cannot look at them
feeling better now mr
kathleens eyes go wide at the sound
you look very nice in your new clothes
merrick looks down at himself
thank you very much
well if there is nothing more i suppose well be leaving you now
the girls leave taking the buckets
merrick alone walks about the room getting the feel of his new clothes
there is a knock at the door and treves enters
you look splendid john
thank you very much
when one is invited to tea one must look ones best
the door opens
merrick disguised enters followed by treves who closes it and hangs up merricks mask on the coat rack
the mirror has been removed leaving a faint outline on the wall
merrick is enchanted by the house
treves takes him by the arm and leads him into the sitting room
anne appears at the top of the stairs
make yourself comfortable john
treves comes back to the foot of the stairs and smiles up at anne
come and meet our quest my love
anne manages a smile comes down the stairs and together they go into the sitting room
merrick is examining everything in the room
nothing in this almost magical world escapes his attention
the furniture the personal mementoes particularly the pictures on the fireplace
he turns around when he hears them enter lowering his eyes
john merrick id like you to meet my wife anne treves
anne is startled but conceals it very well
smiling im very pleased to meet you mr
anne extends her hand
john takes her hand and looks up very slowly meeting her eyes
then merrick bursts into tears
anne is at a loss as to what to do
merrick takes his hand from hers and covers his eyes weeping pitiously
treves puts his hand on merricks shoulder
whats the matter
why are you upset
sobbing im not used to such kindness
from a beautiful woman
treves and anne exchange worried looks
would you like a nice cup of tea mr
still sobbing yes
yes a cup of tea would go nicely
anne goes now to get the tea
would you like to see the rest of the house
merrick cannot answer through his sobs
come with me john
ill show it to you
anne is composing herself by busily fixing the tea and cakes
she stops for a moment takes a breath and then resumes her activity
treves and merrick coming down the stairs
merrick is calm now
they go into the sitting room where anne is just setting the tea tray out
treves ushers merrick to a highbacked sofa and sits him down
merrick is very shy of anne
treves and anne sit on the other side of the table
yes please two
one or two
anne serves the tea
john loves the house
you have so many nice things and so much room
yes we do have a lot of room
but you should see the place on weekends when i see patients here
sometimes there are so many we have to set them down wherever we can
in fact mrs
treves sometimes says that the only room she can call her own is the bedroom
treves and anne laugh good naturedly
merricks face as always is quite blank
earnestly well its a lovely bedroom
what do you call that thing above the bed
thats a canopy john
how is your tea john
its very good
im enjoying my visit with you very much
its so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home
im sorry i made a spectacle of myself
not at all john
i love the way youve arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece
is that the way its done in most houses
who are they of
oh our relatives
may i see
treves goes to the fireplace and takes down a few pictures
he hands a picture of the girls to merrick
as if looking at an icon the children
where are your children oh theyre gone for the day
the word gives him pleasure friends
ah yes friends
and here is one of fredericks mother
and here are my mother and father
they have noble faces
a cord is struck ive always thought that myself
merrick sets the picture down carefully
ever so timidly would you
would you like to see my mother
startled your mother
he reaches into his cloak and brings out the small portrait of the beautiful woman
treves is absolutely amazed
merrick gently hands the picture to anne
merrick shes beautiful
she has the face of an angel
she was an angel
she was so kind
so kind to me
its not her fault for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant
im sure i must have been a great disappointment to her
visibly touched oh no mr
no son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment
if only i could find her
if only she could see me now here with such lovely kind friends
treves and you mr
then maybe she would love me as i am
ive tried to hard to be good
at this anne is so extremely touched that she begins to cry
she tries to hold it in but to no avail
she reaches a hand out to merrick and he takes it
he tries to comfort her
but anne goes on as treves in wonder watches her and merrick locked together in the communication of intense sympathy
merrick in the dimly lit rear hall is huddled over a trash can tucked underneath a stairway
he pulls out a discarded drug box
he holds it closely to his chest and goes into his room
merrick goes to his table and puts the box down
he hangs up his disguise then goes back to the window and pulls the curtains aside
moonlight bathes the table illuminating the portrait of his mother
john seats himself and sets the box in front of him
he reaches for a pencil and then begins to draw windows on the front of the box
nora is coming down the hall with a breakfast tray
she stops at merricks door and raises a hand to knock
merrick as before is hunched over the table pencil in hand
the sides of the box are covered with carefully drawn windows and archways
there is a knock at the door and merrick startled looks up
nora enters and puts the tray on the table
she glances at the box
good morning mr
she turns and walks to the cabinet for linen and bath supplies
she opens it and takes out a clean towel and a blanket
she pauses and turns to look back at the table
merrick is concentrated on his work
nora curious now walks to the table
merrick conscious of her presence leans back in his chair and looks up at her
what is this that youre doing
merrick is silent
pointing at the box what is it
merrick points through the window
oh of course
why thats very good i mean youve gotten the windows and arches just right
but its so good i mean
its so very good
where did you get this box
merrick points out toward the hallway
oh the wastecan
i meant no harm it was the only place where i could find cardboard
i thought it has been thrown away
its alright it was thrown away
no one wants it
its just that its a little dirty thats all
she sets the towel and blanket down as she leans closer to inspect the box
she points to a circle drawn on top
the main spire
oh the spire
how silly of me its as plain as day
merrick where did you learn to do this
i learned a long time ago
nora looks at the box
oh but how will you finish it
you havent any more cardboard
merrick at a loss shrugs his shoulders
the movement makes nora aware of his body and he is the elephant man once again
ill have to find some more
well good day mr
she quickly exits
merrick watches her go and then turns back to his work
he sees the towel and the blanket
he turns quickly to call after nora but stops himself
merrick takes up the towel and blanket walks into the bathroom and carefully drapes the towel over the back of the bath
merrick is at his table working on his cathedral
there is a knock at the door
good morning john
john theres someone here who would like to meet you
would that be alright
merrick is a trifle apprehensive but he agrees
treves ushers mrs
kendal through the door
at the sight of her merricks eyes go wide
john id like you to meet one of the brightest lights of the british stage mrs
kendal john merrick
good day mr
ive brought you some things
i hope youll like mr
i hope you dont think it too forward
i knew youd understand
she hands merrick a nicely framed picture of herself
merrick is speechless overjoyed by the gift
i want you to know that i dont go about giving my pictures to just anyone
i would never think it
its so beautiful
you are so
ill give it a place of honor here next to my mother
he places it with great care next to his mothers portrait
shes very pretty your mother
treves smiles at them
merrick is a trifle nervous but mrs
kendal smiles at him and he relaxes a little
treves says that you are in the theatre
do you live there
oh no mr
i just work there
well even to work there would be wonderful
is it beautiful
youve never been
well you must go
it is one of the most beautiful places on earth
of course im rather partial
tell me about it please
its very difficult to put into a nutshell but i should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the
world to any time you desire
you may look over the shoulders of kings unobserved battle with ruthless tyrants and marry the beautiful princess all in the space of a few hours
onstage you may be whoever you wish to be do anything you please and always always live happily ever after
the theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world mr
it is lights and music gaiety and joy
well its romance
the magic word romance
thats one thing the theatre has in great store
which reminds me
i have something else for you
she produces a beautiful leather bound volume of shakespeares works
merrick takes it with reverence and begins to leaf through it
have you read it
no but i certainly shall
merrick finds a place and begins to read
romeo and juliet
i know of this
if i profane with my unworthiest hand this holy shrine the gentle fine is this my lips two blushing pilgrims ready stand to smooth that rough touch with a tender
merrick embarrassed by these last words starts to close the book
kendal knows juliets lines by heart
she looks at merrick for a moment then replies tenderly
good pilgrim you do wrong your hand too much which mannerly devotion shows in this for saints have hands that pilgrims hands do touch and palm to palm is holy
merrick pauses looking at kendal then continues
have not saints lips and holy palmers too
ay pilgrim lips that they must use in prayer
o then dear saint let lips do what hands do
they pray grant thou lest faith turn to despair
they both look at each other for a long silent moment
treves is touched and amazed
merrick youre not an elephant man at all
youre a romeo
people are happily drinking and singing and laughing
bytes and the boy are keeping a watchful eye on the night porter who is making a deal with a couple of men at a table
they hand over a few coins and follow the night porter out of the pub
bytes finishes his beer and thumps the glass down on the bar
he wipes his mouth with his sleeve and he and the boy casually follow the other three men out
bytes and the boy stand by the pub door watching the men cross the street and go to the back gate of the hospital which the night porter unlocks and
leaves unlocked but closed behind them
they walk into bedstead square laughing quietly
bytes crosses the street and goes to the gate
he walks along the iron fence and watches the night porter and his customers
he stops and waits to see where they go
the night porter stands the two men before a window and motions for them to wait
he goes through a door into the hospital
after a few moments the window opens wide and there neatly framed and silhouetted stand merrick and the night porter gripping merricks neck
the two men outside start back in shock but stand mesmerized by what they see
we hear the laughter of the night porter echo across the empty square
bytes smiles broadly and says softly to himself
so there you are my boy my treasure
we see a small circle of women having tea and gossip
one of their daughters off to the side is reading a newspaper society page
mummy listen to this
hush jennifer cant you see mummys talking
but its about mrs
the actress you go on so much about
she has got the womens attention
kendal always at the forefront of fashion and form was seen leaving the london the other afternoon
no dear readers the most facile actress of our day has not been taken ill but rather said she was visiting a friend
and who was the lucky recipient of this attention
quick enquiries proved it to be none other than mr
john merrick the elephant man with whom our readers are undoubtedly familiar
after a chat of three quarters of an hour mrs
kendal was kind enough to leave mr
merrick with an autographed portrait of herself
owing to a disfigurement of the most extreme nature mr
merrick has never been properly presented to london society
but knowing that wherever mrs
kendal goes others inevitably follow the questions arises will london society present itself to him
a carriage draws up in the street outside the hospital
a nicely dressed woman sticks her head out the window looks around and scowls disappointedly
nearby is parked another carriage and driver
to her driver parkins whose carriage is that
well mum that looks like alexander lord waddingtons driver
lord and lady waddington
drive back to the house
indicating her clothing i cant be seen in this
they drive off
above merricks bookshelf we see a row of framed pictures of prettily smiling society women
kendal has started a fad
we pan slowly by them and down to merricks table where his mother and mrs
kendal have their place of honor
the cathedral is also there
beside it is a modest tea service
we now see a gentleman standing behind a seated lady
they hold teacups
they are both very attractive and empty headed and seem on the verge of screaming
they smile at merrick who has been talking the whole while
merrick holds an elegant silvertipped walking stick across his lap and admires a ring that only fits his little finger
thank you for your kind gifts
i cant say enough about this ring
and this walking stick is ever so dashing
so much more elegant than my old one
the lady and gentleman nod nervously
john takes the teapot from the service and refills their cups
the ladys hand shakes rattling the cup against the saucer
if you have a chill i can close the window
oh no no no im fine
i mean thank you
i dont get out as often as id like to for some people do find my appearance disturbing
of course i cant fault them
we see the smiling pictures
people are often frightened by what they dont understand
we see the picture of merricks mother
and it is hard to understand even for myself for you see mother was so very beautiful
we draw close to his mothers picture
hows your tea
treves walks the lord and lady their faces locked in terrible silence to the door
mothershead at her desk watches them pass with great disapproval
under her breath watery headed bunch
i regret that i must leave you here m lord m lady
thank you so much for coming
it was an act of the greatest charity
oh no mr
treves the pleasure was all ours
as they turn to go their faces drop their loathing undisguised
treves closes the door
he goes to mothershead
incredible isnt it
well i think john has had enough visitors for one day mothershead
ive got a lecture at the college ill be back this evening
excuse me sir
id like to have a word with you
well quickly please mothershead im overdue
i cant understand why you let those people go in there sir
now mothershead you have to understand that this is very good for john
he relishes contact with people outside the hospital
but you saw them sir
they couldnt hide their disgust
they dont care anything for john theyre just trying to impress their friends
arent you being just a little harsh mothershead
you yourself hardly treated john with much loving kindness when he first arrived
i bathed him didnt i
i fed him and cleaned up after him
if loving kindness can be called care and practical concern then yes i did treat him with loving kindness and im not ashamed to say it
youre right mothershead please forgive me
of course i appreciate everything youve done for john and im glad that you are concerned about his welfare
but im the physician in charge and i must do what i think best
im also very late so please forgive me
he starts to go
mothershead steps in front of him detaining him
if you ask me sir hes just being stared at all over again
we pan across merricks bookcase now quite full and we see a few titles moll flanders emma jane eyre pamela and then to merrick
he and treves are reading poetry together
when will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye
when will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky
when will the clouds be aweary of fleeting
when will the heart be aweary of beating and nature die
never nothing will die
the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats nothing will die
merrick closes his book and sits silently for a moment
treves there is something ive been meaning to ask you for some time
can you cure me
treves is taken aback
he considers then says tentatively
no john i cant
i can care for you but i cant cure you
i thought as much
treves ponders over what merrick has just said
he looks at merrick and something very odd happens
merrick is looking levelly at him
for the first and only time we see expression on his face
it is a calm knowing look almost a benign smile
at that very moment there is a bright flash of light behind merricks head seemingly from the window
treves blinks unable to comprehend what has just happened
when he looks again the moment has passed
merrick his back to treves moves to the bookcase to replace the volume
theres a knock at the door
nora enters with a brown paper parcel tied with string
merrick says nothing
are you looking for me sister
no sir mr
to merrick i have something for you
she puts the parcel on the table and opens it
we see several squares of new cardboard a cutting knife a pastepot and a few brushes and some paint
i thought these things would be helpful with your cathedral
merrick examines the materials with reverence and thanks her profusely
treves is moved and a little disconcerted
merrick lays the things aside carefully and begins to pull the crude spires from the discarded box
nora smiles at the busy merrick and exits
the cathedral is coming along nicely
bending over the model yes soon i will start the main spire but i must finish these columns first how kind of her
treves notices to his dismay that the growths on merricks head are larger
he finds it very difficult to disguise his concern
how blind of me
is there anything else john anything at all that i could get for you
there is nothing
i have everything you have given me everything i could possibly want
i am happy every hour of the day
i only wish there was something i could give to you
please john it would give me so much pleasure to give you something
something just for yourself
isnt there something you would like to have
merrick is silent
he goes over to his cloak reaches into it and pulls out a folded up advertisement
he hands it to treves who examines it closely
it is an advertisement for an elegant gentlemans dressing bag boasting ivory brushes silver fittings and moroccan silk lining
you want a dressing bag john
you dont think its too gaudy do you
mothershead finds treves walking slowly down the hall looking at the ad
treves some more books arrived for mr
thank you mothershead
have a porter put them in my office
seeing the ad whats that
a dressing bag
very smart indeed
john wants it
a dressing bag
you dont think its too gaudy do you
john thinks its very dashing
something no gentleman should be without
im inclined to agree
he walks off
a dressing bag
merrick is still at his cathedral working away
suddenly he looks up at the window and the night porter is standing there smiling wickedly pointing a finger at him
treves is standing by a table on which are two stacks of books
treves selects books from the stacks and puts them into a box
treves looks troubled
he takes one from the pile and examines it
its a copy of frankenstein
you stay with me
calling from the next room dinner will be served shortly dear
getting no response she enters
more romances for john
far away hmmm
whats the matter
youve been like this all evening
ive just been thinking about something that man bytes said
what could that wretched vampire say to upset you
that i am very little different from him
oh thats absurd frederick
no no frederick thats all wrong
john is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life
and that is completely due to you
but why did i do it
what was this all for
so john merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort
or so i could become famous
frederick just what is it that you are saying
am i a good man or am i a bad man
she holds him in her arms
youre a good man
a very good man
we see from treves eyes that he is not reassured
it is very dark
there is a dim red glow coming from the holes in a furnace door
we hear a door open and footsteps coming downstairs
a man comes into the basement carrying something large and black
he approaches the furnace and opens the door
the man is treves
he is holding the stiff black surgeons coat of which he was once so proud
he looks at it for a moment and then stuffs it into the furnace
inside the coat starts to smoke heavily then bursts into flames
treves watches it burn and then closes the door
we see carr gomm walking down the hall to his office
broadneck appears going the other way
youll no doubt be pleased to know that weve received a smashing response to my letter
its all very heartwarming though several letters do mention how beastly it would be to part the poor fellow from mr
treves and the staff but since the committee insists
scowling good day carr gomm
broadneck walks on
carr gomm goes into his office
mothershead is standing by the desk looking through a small stack of mail
is this all there is for john
im afraid so mrs
we see in a pair of hands holding a buff colored envelope embossed with the royal seal
we follow the hands down the hall to a door where one of the hands knocks next to the f
carr gomm sign then enters the office
carr gomm and mothershead look up to see a porter with the buff envelope enter
carr gomm takes the letter and the porter exits
carr gomm opens the letter and reads his expression changing from concern to delight
what is it
what is it
carr gomm hands her the letter
never having touched royal stationary before mothershead handles it delicately
she begins to read
broadneck and the other committee members are seated at their table anxious to get the meeting underway
they talk among themselves
the door opens and carr gomm and treves enter
treves seems quite nervous but carr gomm is relaxed and smiling
dont you think this is a bit premature
we dont have the backing yet to
steady on treves
have a seat
treves sits and carr gomm takes his place at the head of the table and raps his gavel
gentlemen i know we begin every meeting by reading the minutes but in the interest of speed i think we should conclude a matter discussed previously to wit that of
john merrick the elephant man
broadneck explodes to his feet
carr gomm smiles at treves who looks quite grim
i was under the distinct impression that we had concluded discussion of this disagreeable matter
had we not ascertained that an elephant man is not acceptable as a patient
have we not very generously allowed the creature to use two of our rooms until such time as he could be properly disposed of
have we not
merrick is working on his cathedral painting details with a very fine brush
as he lifts the brush from the paint jar a drop falls on the table
merrick carefully lays down the brush and wipes up the spilled paint with a cloth
i must be more careful
which brings to mind my next point
the rules gentlemen the rules
in a society such as ours it is of paramount importance that we not stray from the established order
has that order not already been fearfully strained by allowing this
sideshow exhibit to take up residence however temporary in two very useful rooms the purpose of which would be far better served in accommodating treatable patients patients to whom this
hospital was originally dedicated
i believe we have a duty
carr gomm still smiles
treves is about to spring to merricks defense but carr gomm catches his eyes and motions for him to remain silent
treves is perplexed
carr gomm checks his pocket watch
merrick as before busily working away
we see a ladybug crawling slowly across the roof of the cathedral
merrick notices it and watches for a moment then reaches up and lays a finger alongside the bug
the bug crawls onto his finger and merrick holds it closer to him
ladybug ladybug fly away home
its cloudy out i know but remember behind the clouds there is always the sun
we see a royal carriage glide to a stop in front of the hospital
a footman jumps down and opens the door
a very elegantly dressed woman begins to emerge
broadneck is still talking
in light of these facts our course is clear
the question is not whether to accept this creature as a patient the question is when will those rooms be vacated for use by better qualified more deserving cases
i move that this elephant man be removed from the premises immediately
we have a sacred duty to cure the sick not care for circus animals
that is my last word on the subject
chairman shall we vote
broadneck turns to carr gomm
carr gomm checks his watch and clears his throat
i take it mr
broadneck that your mind is fixed on this matter
broadneck blusters with rage
dont you have ears
i am unalterably opposed to any
carr gomm smiles and again checks his watch
treves is very nervous
we see two nurses their backs to us walking down the hall
they start to go in a doorway when they stop suddenly very startled and curtsey deeply
mothershead comes into the hall also curtseying madly
she is followed by the elegantly dressed woman who is followed in turn by two footmen
they walk regally down the hall
no my mind is made up on this and i am resolved to stand firm
you shall not sway me
may we now vote mr
chairman at long last
carr gomm checks his watch
the door to the room begins to open
yes i believe that time has come
the two footmen enter the room
gentlemen her royal highness alexandra princess of wales
the elegantly dressed woman enters
good morning gentlemen
i hope i am not interrupting
indeed not your highness
your presence is always greatly appreciated
we were just about to put the matter of mr
merrick to a vote
he turns to the other committee members the princess is very interested in mr
indeed i am sir as is the queen
i have a brief communication from her highness which she has requested i read to you to the governing committee london hospital
i would very much like to commend you for the charitable face you have shown mr
john merrick the elephant man
it is laudable that you have provided one of englands most unfortunate sons with a safe and tranquil harbour a home
for this immeasurable kindness as well as the many other acts of mercy on behalf of the poor of which mr
carr gomm has kept me informed i gratefully thank you
signed victoria empress of india queen of the united kingdom of great britain and ireland
looking straight at broadneck i am sure you gentlemen may be counted on to do the christian thing
alix seats herself
thank you very much your highness you may be sure we shall
broadneck seems very unnerved
well then i move that mr
john merrick be admitted to the london hospital on a permanent basis on condition that the hospital shall receive a yearly payment equal to the cost of occupying one bed
and that the funds for his care shall be clearly separate from hospital funds
all those in favor
carr gomm raises his hand
the other members puzzled look at broadneck
quite red in the face broadneck looks at carr gomm then to treves then to the princess
he seems to almost deflate then slowly raises his hand
the other members now thoroughly confused raise their hands as well
carr gomm bangs his gavel smiling broadly
treves is almost beside himself with happiness and the princess is obviously very pleased
the motion is carried
broadneck humiliated cannot look at anyone
well now we may go about our normal business
merrick is working on his cathedral
it is almost finished
he is detailing the spire carefully painting in the stonework
there is a knock at the door
please come in
treves enters carrying a wrapped parcel followed by carr gomm and mothershead
smiling broadly good afternoon john mr
carr gomm has something he would like to say to you
treves defers to carr gomm
merrick it is my great pleasure to welcome you officially to the london hospital
the governing committee this morning voted unanimously to provide you these rooms on a permanent basis
this is your home now
im so very very pleased for you
merrick is speechless
he just looks from treves to carr gomm to mothershead
so you see john theres no need for a lighthouse
all your friends are here
welcome home john
merrick finds it very difficult to speak
you did this for me
please thank the governing committee for me
i will do my utmost to merit their kindness
merrick looks about him at his rooms
its beginning to dawn on him that this is indeed his that at last he has a real home a place of his own
trying the words on for size my home
there is one more thing john
treves hands merrick the package
merrick carefully pulls off the wrapping paper
its the dressing bag
merrick is overjoyed with the gift
he lovingly handles the articles taking them in and out of their compartments opening and closing the bag
is it the one you wanted
are you sure
because i can take it back
thank you my
clouds billowing moving swiftly
merrick is alone wearing his cloak and standing by the table cradling the dressing bag
he takes each article out of the bag and lays it carefully on the table all in very neat order
he stares at the elegant objects then rearranges them
merrick picks up the toothbrush examining it with a sort of reverence
he does the same with the ivory handled razors and the comb
theres a good crowd in tonight lots of drinking and shouting and glasses breaking
several of the neighborhood working girls are having a bit of a rest looking for a laugh
the night porter is rounding up customers his pockets ringing with coins
people have their hands raised urging the night porter to take them along to see the elephant man
the night porter goes to a table where a man sits with two of the girls
here now these lovely ladies aint never seen it
to man youre on mate
to all the others alright alright thats enough for this performance
the others all moan their disappointment
hang on hang on theres always tomorrow night
not to worry
bytes sitting at his usual place at the bar sees that tonight is his chance
the night porter rounds up his customers all twelve of them
bytes saunters over to the night porter
room for one more
at the right price
bytes drops several coins in the night porters hand
well lets be off then
the whole group happily leaves the pub several still holding their gin bottles
the ladies are rather unsteady on their feet
as they all leave the night porter says quietly now
we dont want to scare him
he laughs merrick as before he reaches over to the picture of mrs
kendal and picks it up
we see his face reflected in the glass
merrick sets the picture down on the table
he takes up one of the silver brushes and using the picture as a mirror neatly brushes his hair over his monstrous skull
he lays the brush down in its specific spot
merrick takes his ring and puts it on his left hand
he opens the cigarette case and stuffs one into his right hand
he takes up his walking stick breathes deeply then walks around the room in a slow circle
merrick is transforming himself
merrick comes back to the table and examines his reflection in the picture
with the ring the stick the cigarette and his neatly brushed hair merrick is the very image of a dashing young man about town
he inclines his head to the picture
hello my name is john merrick
i am very very pleased to meet you
at this moment the door bursts open
the night porter stands grinning
merrick is frozen caught
seeing merrick in his outfit the night porters jaw drops
they both stare at each other
the night porter begins to laugh hysterically
merrick frantically begins to put away his dressing bag articles
when merrick starts taking off his ring the night porter comes over to him and grabs him by the cloak
you look lovely
dont change a thing darling
you look like the bleedin prince of wales
the night porter drags him by the neck to the window
he throws the window open out in the square is the waiting audience
the elephant man
he strips off merricks cloak
the audience gasps
a few people who have been before laugh and clap
laughing and clapping horrible
i told you it was horrible
he starts kissing each whore
the crowd is mesmerized
bytes moves in behind the man with the whores
to man perhaps the ladies would like a closer look
the man begins to laugh
the whores laugh drunkenly and halfheartedly resist being taken in to see the elephant man
as they are pushed through the door come on jack
the whores reluctantly enter the room
the night porter laughs at their discomfort
the man notices all of merricks pictures of women
cor hes a real ladies man come on
give the ladies man a kiss
he lets one of the whores go and grabs the other one from behind at the wrists
come on youll give him a kiss
still laughing but a trifle scared come on jack
the night porter has turned merrick and is holding him for the approaching kiss
the crowd is egging them on
the man forces the woman closer and closer and raises her arms to force her into an embrace
as merrick and the woman touch being pressed together the woman begins to scream
the night porter the man and the crowd all laugh with glee
merrick and the whore now have their faces pressed together
the whore is screaming and merrick is crying out and screaming too
here thats enough romance
now into bed
merrick and the whore are pushed onto merricks bed
the night porter grabs the other whore now
she begins screaming wildly
a prince needs a harem
he pushes the screaming whore down onto merrick
her screaming face goes right into his
merrick tries to move away and as he does his head goes too far back and his cried turn to horrible wheezing
mind his head
youll kill him
the crowd outside is trying to see in the window
five or six more have gone into merricks room to see
all are laughing and screaming and trying to get a close look at the elephant man
yelling quiet down
youll have the whole place down on us
outside yelling loudly bring him out then sos we all can see him
merrick recognizes his voice and looks frantically around for his former owner
the night porter pulls merrick up by the window again
he then begins pushing the crowd out the door
suddenly one of the crowd outside reaches up and grabs merricks good hand and pulls him half out the window
others follow suit and haul him all the way through
the cathedral falls to the floor breaking into several pieces
because of the horror of touching him the crowd outside lets merrick fall to the ground
the night porter whirls around and sees that merrick is gone
he pushes the rest of the people outside and quickly goes to merrick lifting him to his feet
unseen by anyone bytes slips into merricks room
merrick is now standing
the crowd moves in
the night porter is enjoying the festivities but looks around nervously for trouble
give im a drink
the man grabs merrick and pours some gin into his mouth then pushes him away
hes caught by another man fed liquor and pushed away
hes pushed now from person to person faster and faster
finally merrick falls to the ground dizzy and a bottle of gin on merricks head
he coughs and moans through the wheezing
the crowd is now strangely silent circling the elephant man like a pack of dogs closing in on a terrified rabbit
suddenly merrick starts to wail
the crowd joins in and they hoist him above their heads screaming with laughter around and around joining him all the while
now we see a window reflecting the scene of terror
a curtain is pulled aside and we see through the reflection the face of the young porter watching everything
hes had enough
merrick is lowered down into the crowd
it parts and the night porter emerges walking merrick toward us to his room
to the crowd behind him meet you at the peacock
bring your friend
laughs drunkenly hes had is fill for one night
the crowd moves through the iron gate of bedstead square
in the background we see bytes boy sitting on top of a wagon
the night porter takes merrick into his room and puts him on the bed
he drunkenly stumbles about trying to out the room in order
he places the smashed hulk of the cathedral back up on its table inadvertently leaving the spire and a few columns on the floor
he picks the cloak up and replaces it on the peg
to merrick i did real well tonight
he takes a purse full of coins out of his pocket
he removes one small coin and flips it on the floor in front of merrick
buy yourself a sweet
the night porter turns and leaves
merrick alone now hears the night porters echoing footsteps and the distant sound of the gate being closed
there is a long silence as merrick collects himself
he then leans back into his pillows with a deep sigh
his eyes close
merricks eyes flash open
we see bytes coming toward him
arent you glad to see me
bytes lifts merrick up off the bed
he reaches out for merricks cloak
we slowly pan over all the smiling womens faces as we hear the following get into your cloak
rustling sound now your hood
we now glide slowly on to merricks mothers picture
merricks good hand comes into the frame trying to reach his mothers picture
he grabs at the table cloth and pulls
now we see bytes gripping merricks arm and pulling
we see the picture fall to the ground with a thud
in the sky the heavy clouds are moving
morning sunlight on the floor of merricks room
we move slowly around discovering the church spire the columns the penny and merricks mothers picture
over this the sound of knocking on the door
through the door we hear treves calling john
the door opens
treves surveys the empty room
quickly he goes into the side bathroom
he comes out with a very worried face
he goes to the cathedral model and is horrified by its condition
he finds the spire and then merricks mothers picture
he quickly leaves the room and walks down the hall
the young porter waiting in the hall approaches treves and stops him
now we see mrs
mothershead entering merricks room surveying the same scene
her face hardens as she sees the picture of merricks mother
now we see treves filled with anger
hes got the information from the young porter and bolts down the hall at full speed
mothershead still in merricks room now become activated with determination to get to the bottom of all this herself
she leaves the room
in the distance is treves marching off
closer to her is the young porter looking worried
she calls him to her
close up of treves angrily walking
mothershead leaves the young porter furiously marching off in the same direction as treves
the night porter is adding fresh coal to the operating room stove
the old coals were still quite hot and now smoke begins to rise
the night porter takes up the bellows and begins to pump the coals into a blaze
the door bangs open and treves is there standing stock still in a cold murderous rage
the night porter frightened by treves intensity begins to sputter
i dont know what you mean sir
treves stalks over to him
dont lie to me
i know all about it
you were seen
where did you take him
i didnt take him anywhere
we were just having some fun
we didnt hurt him
just having a laugh thats all
when i left him he was in his bed safe and sound
you tortured him
you tortured him you bastard
where is enraged youre not listening to me
i aint done nothing wrong
people pay to see your monster mr
i just take the money
treves takes the night porter by the arm and begins to drag him out
the night porter throws his hand off violently whirls around his back to the door and seizes the poker from the stove
have a care mr
i aint afraid of you
you and your bleedin elephant man
im glad what i did
and you cant do nothing
only mothershead can sack me
treves blind with fury tears the poker from the night porters hand and is on the verge of using it
unbeknownst to them mothershead has storm into the room just in time to hear the last of the night porters speech
without a break she strides over to him and with a lightning movement boxes him soundly on the ears
the blow is staggering and makes quite a formidable sound
the night porter falls to the floor barely conscious
treves is standing in the street looking at the now bare shop front
he walks to the window and tries to clean a small circle in the glass
he peers in
from inside through the smeared dirty window we see treves distorted face
id like to think i felt no less for john than you treves but face the facts the man has disappeared very likely to the continent
theres no question of your going after him youre desperately needed here by your patients
remember treves you did everything in your power
everything in your power
a moving circle of light in blackness
as we move closer to the light it becomes distinguishable as a peephole in the side of a wagon
through the peephole we see a dark overcast sky
it is dusk
we move even closer to the hole
just beside it we see the head of a horse with blinders on moving alongside
we move closer still to see its rider a policeman
he notices the peephole and leans forward in the saddle looking in
from outside we see the peephole and an eye gazing out
the eye is replaced by a plug
the policeman starts back and pulls up on the reins
as he falls behind we see the portrait of the e
from the front of the shop in london on the back of the wagon
the policeman looks at the poster
the wagon moves on out of frame and the policeman slows his horse to a stop
the wagon is being driven by bytes
the boy sits beside him
another policeman rides abreast of him
they ride a few yards more and then the policeman stops by a sign at the fork of the road reading aalst km
the policeman gestures for bytes to move on
the wagon continues down the road
bytes and the boy are riding along the road
bytes turns in his seat and opens a hatch in the roof
he looks down in
inside the wagon lit by the last dregs of the sunset is merrick huddled in his sleeping posture
he feels the light and looks up weakly wheezing obviously very sick
a small bowl of potatoes sets untouched beside him
still havent eaten eh
eat my treasure i want you healthy
he snaps the hatch shut and turns forward muttering to himself
im beginning to feel your weight
we see a field with a road in the distance leading to it
it is misty the sun barely peeking through the rolling clouds above
on the road the wagon is plodding toward us
at the bottom of the frame a female pinhead in a dress comes into view
she is watching the wagon
a dwarf comes into view beside her
she points to the wagon and she and the dwarf excitedly confer
they turn back to watch its progress and the dwarf reaches up and takes the pinheads hand
we move back slowly to reveal a ring of circus wagons in the field
another dwarf comes up to the two other freaks and watches the wagon
we pull back further to see a small circus
there are little stalls and cages containing two mangey lions some screeching spider monkeys and some squawking parrots
the circus is abustle in the drab grey field
close up of the pinhead jumping up and down in her excitement
there is a clap of thunder
a rainstorm over the freak show
we pass along the row of freak wagons
these freaks truly deserve the name
they are quite different from the rather domestic ones we saw in the circus in england
these are not fakes
a rope cordons us off from them
the audience which we see all around us is enjoying the freaks but there is a sense of vulgarity in their gaiety
they seem hard and cold and jaded
we move by pinheads a hermaphrodite and a legless wonder
some siamese twins are playing cats cradle
past them runs a dwarf with a plumed hat playing a small flute
trailing behind him on a string is a small wooden ark on wheels
a lionfaced man is combing the hair that covers his face
a rubber man pulls the skin of his neck up over his face
there is a fairly big crowd standing around a tall man affectionately rubbing the small parasitic twin growing out of his chest
the barker owners compete with each other and the occasional thunder
finally we hear the patter of bytes telling of the horrible fate of john merricks mother on that african isle so many years ago
a very big crowd is listening to him
they are looking at the poster at the back of the wagon waiting impatiently to see the elephant man
the result is plain to see
ladies and gentlemen
the terrible elephant he raps twice with merricks silver tipped walking stick and pulls the poster up
merrick is standing unsteadily in the wagon
he is quite sick
the audience gasps and shudders
a few shrieks are heard
the elephant man is always the elephant man
merrick slowly turns around the audience gasping at the sight of the horrible tumors
bytes raps the walking stick twice
merrick begins a series of awkward movements his pained version of a dance
without his walking stick it is very difficult for him but he strives to do it
some of the crowd laughs at this others shudder at the strange sight
suddenly merrick falters and comes to a stop breathing irregularly
seeing this bytes goes to him and bringing the stick behind merrick out of view of the audience jabs him savagely in the back
merrick groans with pain and some of the people in the first row flinch back
merrick begins to dance again as people throw coins onto the stage which the boy gathers and puts into a cap
the poster is rolled up merrick on the floor of the wagon wheezing horribly
beside him on the floor is a bowl of what looks to be slop and potatoes
bytes is standing at the back of the wagon looking down at merrick
he picks up the bowl and jabs it at merrick
eat my treasure
merrick looks wearily at the bowl but makes no move to accept it
i said eat
merrick closes his eyes
this really enrages bytes
eat damn you
he jabs the bowl at merrick almost as if hed shove it down his throat
i said eat
at this last word he throws the contents of the bowl splattering in merricks face
he stands for a moment looking down at merrick who has lapsed into a coughing fit
there is a small crowd gathered in a circle on the grass
merrick stands amidst them on a small wooden stool bytes jabbing him from behind again
merrick is making a strange moaning cry slightly reminiscent of the trumpet of an elephant
the boy is passing amongst the people with a cap collecting coins
merrick lifts his face to the sky the sound of his own misery mingling with his elephant call
we see the poster of the elephant man
bytes stands before it saying the last of the patter
the result is plain to see
ladies and gentlemen
the terrible elephant he raps twice with the walking stick and pulls the poster up
merrick is now extremely sick
he almost looks as if he is unable to stand
the audience as always is quite alarmed
bytes smiles and comes forward
merrick looks incapable of even this simple movement but he slowly manages to turn
the crowd reacts to the horrible condition of merricks back and head
bytes satisfied that the elephant man is having the proper effect raps the walking stick again
merricks eyes look painfully up to the heavens and he begins to shuffle clumsily about the platform
without his stick this is very difficult for him causing him great pain
it is a humiliating spectacle and the crowd unimpressed by the halting movements of the monster begins to heckle him
bytes seeing that the dancing isnt being received well moves to place a stool next to merrick
merrick already exhausted by his little dance wheezes and coughs attempting to ascend the stool
it is useless he is just too tired
again the audience shouts its disapproval booing and hissing the elephant man
bytes curses and raps again demanding obedience from merrick who again bravely tries to mount the stool
he cannot do it
bytes striving to save the moment and please the angry crowd goes to merrick and roughly helps him up
merrick teeters precariously on the stool
bytes raps the stick
give the call of the elephant
merrick hesitates and bytes bangs the stick on the wagon
the audience quiets down to hear the elephant call
merrick senses this lull but he is very frightened and sick
he lifts his head wearily and makes a few wavering cries that sound very little like an elephant
merrick tries again but there is no improvement
the crowd begins to jeer at merrick exhorting him to make the call of the elephant
merrick is now almost swaying on the stool
he attempts to step down but as he does it finally becomes too much for him and he collapses into a heap on the wagon floor
the crowd is no longer in the least bit challenged by this piteous mess and they break out into a vocal fury throwing objects at the wagon
bytes is humiliated at first and then is quickly angry
he turns to merrick
get up you miserable bastard
but merrick just lays there moaning and wheezing irregularly
he jabs merrick a few times with the silver tipped walking stick
the crowd jeers even louder still
there is a clap of thunder
realizing its no use im beatin a dead horse
bytes is seated by a campfire drinking from a bottle of wine
he is very drunk
from the wagon behind him we can hear merrick coughing and wheezing
we also hear the boy almost pleading with merrick to stop coughing and to try to eat
as bytes listens he gets angrier and angrier
finally he rises clumsily to his feet and stumbles over to the back of the wagon
another bleedin heart
the boy is crouched over merrick who looks little better than a corpse
bytes points a menacing finger at merrick
you sly bastard
youre doing this to spite me arent you
aw bytes hes sick
hes doing it to spite me i tell you and its got to stop
hes sick bytes
hes going to die
enraged if he does its his own fault
but im not burying that swollen bag of flesh
he reaches in and grabs merrick roughly by his arm dragging him out of the wagon
what are you going to do
ill show you
ill show you
he drags merrick across the way to a small monkey wagon
the boy follows his face filled with sympathy for merrick
bytes opens the cage door and stuffs merrick in as the monkeys scream
he slams the door and latches it
then he quickly turns still in his rage and starts for the wagon
as he passes the boy the boy tries to stop him
bytes knocks the boy down with the back of his hand
he stalks to his wagon and climbs inside
after some muffled sound merricks food bowl comes flying out
there are more muffled sounds as merricks stick cloak and hood are also thrown out one by one
the boy looks to merrick who is in a panic trying to keep himself away from the monkeys who scream loudly in all the excitement
we hear bytes cursing to himself in the wagon
the boy frightened goes to the fire and pulls a blanket around him
merrick crawls to one corner of the cage away from the screaming monkeys
suddenly one of the braver ones leaps at merrick with a scream biting him on the arm and moving quickly away
merrick yelps with pain and struggles to move away
the other monkeys have gotten the idea now and they begin to move warily toward merrick screeching threateningly
another leaps out and clings to merricks shoulder biting and scratching furiously then he too jumps away
merrick cries out
now the monkeys are getting braver and more and more of them lash out at merrick with their paws
they jump onto him with savage screams biting him on the head and neck and shoulders
merricks eyes search for escape
the monkeys come on and on without a break screaming madly all the while
with his good hand merrick begins to pull himself up with the aid of a bar
the monkeys strive to pull him down
merrick looks through the bars at the wagon and screams frantically
but bytes wont come
something is happening inside merrick
a wave of feeling is growing coming from a place in him very deep down and far away
this feeling seems to give him strength and he is able to pull himself all the way up in spite of the hairy moving mass that now seems to cling
to every part of his body
the feeling is surging up inside merrick making his body shake uncontrollably as if he were a volcano about to erupt
the monkeys keep on biting and screeching pulling at him
suddenly a formidable cry rings out of merricks mouth with a power and assurance we have never heard from him before
he whirls about and cries out again a shattering no the force of which scatters most of the monkeys away from him onto the cage floor dumbfounded
merrick grabs a monkey who has managed to hang and throws it into the group of monkeys on the floor
the monkeys have been shocked into silence pushed into the other end of the cage
merrick perhaps as surprised as the monkeys rests against the bars of the cage
the monkeys make no move toward him
they sit across the cage from merrick silently watching him with fear
we now see merrick crouched in a corner of the cage in his sleeping position
we see the monkeys again and hear whispering in the still night
cu of merricks head resting on his knees
the whispering continues and a shadow falls across merrick
merrick begins to stir his head comes up and he looks around
the whispering stops
we pull back to see some of the freaks from the circus gathered around the monkey cage in a small group
they are pinheads male and female the dwarf we saw earlier with the plumed hat and the ark on a string another male dwarf a female midget a lion faced
man and an armless wonder
the female pinhead reaches into the cage and pats merricks head
y y yes want to come out
you want out
wont be a moment
he looks to the lion faced man and speaks to him in a foreign tongue
the lion faced man unlatches the cage door
then after further instruction from the plumed dwarf the freaks gently help merrick out of the cage closing the door behind him
the dwarf speaks to the others again and the lion faced man and the armless wonder move to each side of merrick
the lion faced man pulls merricks right arm over his shoulder
merrick puts his left arm around the armless wonder
youve got to get away from here
he and the other dwarf light two lanterns and they begin to move off
the boy by the wagon has awakened
he sees the small caravan of freaks moving in the darkness the light from the lanterns bobbing over the grass
his first instinct is to call for bytes which he almost does but then he thinks better of it
he rises and goes to where bytes threw merricks stick and disguise
he nicks them up and goes to the small band of strangely shaped beings
they stop and watch him warily
handing over the things here
youll need these
merrick looks the boy in the eye and the boy holds his gaze
good of you mate
to merrick good luck
ill be alright
the small band moves away through the wagons
the boy watches the lantern light receding in the darkness
he turns and looks to the wagon the poster of the elephant man and the dying fire
he moves to the fire quickly collecting a few blankets and belongings
then taking one last look at the garish poster just visible in the night he runs off into the darkness
we see the beams of the lanterns moving through the trees like will o the wisps
they help merrick along the plumed dwarf directing them from time to time
as they move along we see them pass a small still pond
the intrepid freaks approach a bend in the road
they go around the corner and before them stands a small train station a train sitting amongst the steam by a platform
the freaks stop just outside the light of the station and the plumed dwarfs instruction get merrick into his disguise
the female pinhead who has carried his stick hands it to merrick squeezing his hand
thank you my friends
the plumed dwarf relays the message and the freaks respond to merrick in their language
ill go in with you youll need a ticket
he turns and confers with the freaks who all rifle through their pockets and produce some coins
then he and merrick walk into the station the freaks watching and waving
the train is about to leave
at a barrier two ticket collectors are taking tickets of a few last minute passengers who hurry off
the plumed dwarf and merrick appear and walk to the barrier
the plumed dwarf hands over the ticket
im just going to help my friend on board
they walk off down the platform
the collectors stare after them
the plumed dwarf his arm around merrick is helping him down the platform as fast as possible his ark trailing behind him
as they pass the windows of the first class carriages we see the ornate interiors and the happy handsome people on their plush seats
the plumed dwarf finds an empty compartment and opens the door
he looks down the platform
the ticket collectors are watching them with great interest
merrick climbs laboriously aboard
the other people on board see merrick react and move away from him as far as they can in the cramped rd class carriage
the plumed dwarf notices this and sniffs at the people with contempt
im sorry i could only get you a third class ticket but its all we had
oh no my friend
say hello to london for me
i miss her
you know i saw you once there in london
youre a great attraction
the whistle blows and the train slowly begins to move off
the plumed dwarf still holding the door open walks along with it
luck my friend luck
who needs it more than we
merrick nods yes and holds out his hand
the train is moving a little faster
the plumed dwarf grabs his hand and they shake
he shuts the door
as the carriage passes merricks mask is pressed up against the window
the plumed dwarf waves to him as the train moves away
he looks at the train for a moment then walks back down the platform
merrick is in the corner facing into the carriage
he looks slowly around
the other passengers have moved away forming almost a moat of space around him
we see the whole carriage now the cowering people and merrick at the far end
seeing their silent horrified stares he moves to the opposite seat facing the back wall
merrick looks around for a moment then sees his reflection in the window
he stares at himself
the carriage is dark now and empty except for merrick
he looks out the window at a sign above a station platform that says oostende and at the few people still walking about
we see the side of the carriage
merrick inside the darkened car is not visible
a conductor walks to the end of the carriage and turns a valve
he opens the door to merricks compartment
im sorry youll have to leave now
merrick is motionless reluctant to leave the security of the darkness
this is the end of the line youll have to leave now
merrick pulls his walking stick from the darkness and plants it firmly on the floor with a loud thud
the conductor expecting violence draws back
a few people on the platform who have stopped to watch this exchange gasp
merrick rises with the help of his stick and slowly descends from the carriage watched very carefully by the others
he looks around for a moment then walks off down the platform
two young toughs follow a little distance behind him laughing and mimicking his uneven gait
we see a short line of people waiting to board a cross channel steamer
the first mate is standing by the gangplank smiling at the women passengers and making the most of his handsome face and crisp white uniform
he surveys the line stops and smiles even more broadly
a very pretty young woman at the end of the line is smiling back
we see the end of the quay disappearing into darkness towards the station
the rhythmic sound of merricks stick is heard as he slowly moves into the light
the woman still smiling at the first mate demurely lowers her eyes
merrick appears behind her breathing heavily from the long walk
the womans face freezes
she turns her head ever so slightly and sees merrick
her face drops
the first mate sees the woman change then sees merrick
he walks out of frame
merrick is still trying to catch his breath as the first mate walks up
the woman looks up at the first mate imploringly
may i see your ticket
merrick confused at first produces his ticket from his cloak
the first mate examines it and hands it back
im sorry theres no room for you on this ship youll have to wait for the next one in the morning
merrick remains motionless
you heard me
theres no room
now be off with you
he points down the quay
merrick turns and walks away
the woman smiles gratefully at the fist mate who tips his hat
two drunks are sitting against the wall drinking and singing
one of them gets up and walks out of frame
merrick peeks around a corner at the drunk
they stare at each other for a long moment
the other drunk comes back sits down and they both start singing again
merrick is in darkness seated around the corner tapping his left hand against his leg keeping in time with the drunken music
we see merrick behind some crates watching the ship
on the wharf a different first mate waits until the last of the morning passengers board the ship
he then nods to the ticket taker and ascends the gangplank nodding to a crew man
on board everyone prepares to get underway
merrick pitches forward from behind the crates half running half stumbling toward the ticket taker
the ticket taker about to board the ship drops the tickets on the ground and stoops to pick them up
as he collects the scattered tickets a hand comes into frame holding a ticket out to him
he reaches for it and calls over his shoulder to the crewman at the plank
he turns back and finally takes a look at the late arrival
youll have to hurr
his mouth drops
merrick hurries past him
the crewman now also sees the passenger as he begins his clumsy ascent of the gangplank
the shrill ships whistle blows
merrick is crouched in a dark corner underneath a stairway his head resting on the points of both knees his arms clasped around them
he is asleep
a few drops of rain fall and hit his cap then a few more and finally it begins to rain
he wakes up and looks around
he hears a voice
through the stairs we see a young couple in the rain at the railing arm in arm
the young woman points
the young man turns to her and smiles
they laugh and hug each other and run inside out of the rain
merricks hand comes into the shot grasping a stair and pulling himself up slowly
he rounds the stairs and walks onto the deck looking after the young couple
merrick walks to the railing and leans over it oblivious of the rain
we see the cliffs of dover
the ships gangplank leading down to a sea of umbrellas
passengers one by one come down the plank and are swallowed by the crowd
on the dock amidst the umbrellas we see merrick
he looks around then moves off into the crowd
the crowd moves past a sign saying to the trains
through a rain streaked window we see rolling green countryside
we pull back to see an elderly man in a heavy black overcoat with a wide brimmed rain hat eating an apple
beside him his wife knits
a few other people similarly clothed are sleeping
we pan across them to see merrick at the back of the car watching the elderly man eat
the last car speeds down the track and disappears
grey light filters through the windows in the high canopy ceiling over the trains in the station
the platforms below fill with people as trains arrive and depart
we now see the station with its newsstands sweetstalls shoeshiners and passengers moving to and fro carrying luggage and looking for their train
a young boy is seated on a pile of baggage looking very adult and bored
his mother stands beside him though we see only a portion of her billowy skirt
we hear her voice in rapid conversation with another woman
the young boy scans the crowd looking for excitement
he sees something
the elderly man we saw on the train and his wife are moving past the barrier
the young boy slowly pulls a peashooter from a pocket puts a pea in his mouth and raises the pipe to his lips
his mothers hand shoots out and grabs it
i thought mummy told you not to bring that horrid thing
cant you behave
she continues her conversation
the boy looks sour
merrick is moving past the barrier
he stops to look around and plan his next move
the boy sees him
he tugs on his mothers skirt
look at that man
his head its huge
mummy why is his head so big
do be quiet little jim
cant you see mummy is speaking
merrick still looking around suddenly turns in little jims direction
he sees the boy tugging at his mothers skirt and pointing at him
he turns and walks in the opposite direction along a wall stacked with trunks and luggage trying as best as he can to blend in
little jim gets up and moves after him
merrick continues along the wall
a few people give him a second look but pass on
little jim comes up alongside him
hey mister why is your head so big
merrick turns and looks at little jim
he looks quickly around
we see across the station an open archway leading out into a street
merrick moves away from little jim out of frame
little jim watches him go
two other boys join little jim
the three of them watch the escaping merrick then move off after him
merrick is frantically trying to make it to the archway
the three boys appear behind him and call out
why dont you answer me
one of the boys reaches down and snatches the hem of merricks cloak
he lifts it trying to catch a glimpse of the mysterious stranger
merrick pulls away and tries to go faster
relishing the hunt the boys follow him taunting him all the way
as they approach the arch little jim determined now steps in front of him cutting him off
merrick comes to an abrupt standstill shrinking from the boy
little jim reaches up to the hood and grasps it firmly
now ill see you
he lifts the hood and then staggers back onto the floor in a spasm of fear
he lets out a shrill scream
merrick turns wildly away looking for another escape
little jims mother hearing her sons cries looks up immediately
she sees merrick and the howling boy in the middle of the station
merrick hearing this looks in her direction and whirls away
he stumbles toward another archway exit
people hearing the noise watch him go
he knocks down a little girl in his flight and she too starts screaming
through the archway comes a bobby
jims mother now with her son calls to him
stop that man
stop that man
merrick stops at the sight of the bobby
the bobby at the arch now aware of the commotion sees merrick and walks quickly towards him
merrick changes course but a group of men alerted by jims mothers screams move forward together cutting him off
they yell at him angrily
one of them darts toward him and grabs a hold of merricks hood
merrick turns frantically away and as he does the hood is pulled off him
the crowd shouts at him as he goes following him in wary pursuit
he moves back past the children and jims mother
they all scream and shield themselves from his approach
another group of people move toward him blocking all escape
behind him he sees a door to a urinal
he moves through it followed by the crowd
we hear fearsome echoes inside
inside the urinal the crowd presses merrick toward a wall
they have become angry now
they shout and there is fear in their voices
they hem merrick in
he looks around hoping for an opening
there is none
he gives a strangled cry and collapses as the bobby pushes his way through the crowd
merrick puts his good hand over his good ear trying to block out the screams of the crowd
quietly to himself i am not an animal
i am a man
a small room off the receiving room
in the center of the room is a low sofa covered with deeply stained shiny black leather
on it lies a man groaning softly
treves is helping a dresser bandage the mans leg
mothershead appears at the doorway
theres a policeman to see you sir
the bobby from the liverpool street station enters
are you frederick treves sir
the card changes hands
treves enters and pushes through the crowd
he sees merrick in a heap on the floor
the sergeant gets up to meet him in the middle of the room but treves keeps walking toward merrick
you know this man sir
treves goes to merrick who just coming to reaches out to him with his good hand
treves pulls him up his eyes brimming with tears
merrick too is weeping
treves embraces him
how can you ever forgive me
treves carr gomm and mrs
kendal are walking down a hallway engaged in conversation
its all arranged
ill send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany mr
youll be using the royal entrance and princess alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box
im very grateful to you mrs
this is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal
john will be very excited
well it is a miracle he ever got back
and im sure mr
treves under your expert care hell have many happy years ahead
i fear not mrs
even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly
as is his pain
how awful for john
and yet not once have any of us heard him complain
there is nothing more frustrating nothing that makes a physician feel more useless than standing by watching his patient deteriorate
and when that patient is a friend no
no theres absolutely nothing i can do
well its all quite
ive never heard
merrick stands before the row of smiling ladies on his wall
he surveys them lovingly for a long moment
he is holding in his hand a bundle of evening clothes the handsome black bow tie lying on the new silk shirt
you women are such strange and wonderful creatures
alas it seems to be my fate to fall in love with each and everyone of you
i especially wish you could all be with me tonight
im finally going to the theatre
he stands for a moment reluctant to leave their company
he goes to his bed placing the clothes upon it and then to the cathedral
he compares it with st
he picks up the main spire and gazes at it but his mind is somewhere else
we see the whole theatre
it is very ornate
the orchestra is tuning up and the house is filled with elegant well dressed handsome people all happily chatting and calling to one another
we see young men and women flirting boldly and generally enjoying each others company
in the royal box mothershead and nora in evening gowns sit up front relishing the spectacle
in the back of the box john sits between treves and the princess
he is dressed in his evening clothes his cloak tied over his shoulders like a cape but he does not wear his hood
the princess is explaining to merrick the workings of a pair of opera glasses
he takes them and delightedly spies about the theatre
john is breathless as the house lights dim and the curtain rises
o for a muse of fire that would ascend the brightest heaven of invention a kingdom for a stage princes to act and monarchs to behold the swelling scene
then should the warlike harry like himself assume the port of mars and at his heels leashd in like hounds should famine sword and fire crouch for employment
but pardon gentles all the flat unraised spirits that have dard on this unworthy scaffold to bring forth so great an object can this cockpit hold the vasty fields of
or may we cram within this wooden o the very casques that did affright the air at agincourt
since a crooked figure may attest in little place a million and let us ciphers to this great account on your imaginary forces work
treves smiling at john
he exchanges knowing smiles with the princess
john watches with the unconstrained delight of a child but his rapture is even more intense and solemn
his attitude is one of wonder and awe and he often leans forward panting in his excitement
to john the characters are not actors in make up and costume but real people
kendal and an actor dressed as royalty doing the last scene of henry the fifth
fair katharine and most fair will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms such as will enter at a ladys ear and plead his love suit to her gentle heart
your majesty shall mock at me i cannot speak your england
o fair katharine if you will love me soundly with your french heart i will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your english tongue
do you like me kate
pardonnez moi i cannot tell vat is like me
an angel is like you kate and you are like an angel
o bon dieu
les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies
what say you fair one
that the tongues of men are full of deceits
oui dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits
i know no way to mince it in love but directly to say i love you
a speaker is but a prater a rhyme is but a ballad
a good leg will fall a straight back will stoop a black beard will turn white a curld pate will grow bald a fair face will wither a full eye
will wax hollow but a good heart kate is the sun and the moon or rather the sun and not the moon for it shines bright and never changes but keeps his course truly
during the above merrick mouths the kings lines
the royal box the princess and the two friends enjoying the show
the chorus steps out to give the epilogue
thus far with rough and allunable pen our bending author hath pursued the story in little room confining mighty men mangling by starts the full course of their glory
small time but in that small most greatly livd this star of england fortune made his sword by which the worlds best garden he achievd
during the above the camera moves in on john
amidst great applause the curtain rings down
through the curtain comes mrs
kendal to renewed applause
she motions the audience to quiet down
thank you for your warm greeting
ladies and gentlemen tonights performance was very special to me because it was very special to someone else a man who knows the theatre and loves the theatre and yet
tonight is the first time hes ever actually been here
i would like to dedicate
the whole company wishes to dedicate from their hearts tonights performance to mr
john merrick my dear friend
she gestures toward the royal box
there is modest applause as the audience rises and turns toward it
merrick cannot be seen in the shadows and the crowd cranes their necks trying to get a glimpse of him
we hear whispers of oh look
its the elephant man
the elephant man
run through the audience
treves turns to john
stand up john
let them see you
oh no i couldnt
its for you john
its all for you
go ahead let them see you
merrick rises and comes forward to thunderous applause
the audience begins to rise and they clap their hands even louder
merrick is overcome by the applause
tears run down his cheeks
treves nora mothershead and the princess filled with pride beam at john
quietly to treves i feel as if ive traveled my whole life just to stand here
merrick in a night shirt is seated at his table working on his cathedral
treves is nearby
i cant blame the king for wanting to marry her
merrick closes his eyes and his head tilts forward slightly
it seems unbearably large too large for him to support
will the cathedral be finished soon john
yes very soon
its truly a masterpiece
well i suppose ill be on my way now
i hoped your enjoyed yourself this evening
it was wonderful
im glad john
he turns and starts out the door
treves comes back to merrick
treves tell me
tell me truly
is it alright did i make any mistakes that you can see
looking at the cathedral no john not one that i can see
then i shouldnt change anything
no no i wouldnt change a thing
the two look at each other silently
ill walk you to the door
merrick rises and goes with treves to the door
you too my friend
treves smiles at john then walks down the darkened hallway
merrick watches him for a moment then slowly shuts the door
we hear the distant echo of treves footsteps
merrick goes back to examine his cathedral looking at it from different angles
he picks up a fine brush dipping it into the paint and makes a few final brush strokes
he moves back into the middle of the room and gazes at it for a long time
he lowers the brush to his side
it is finished
the cathedral is a masterwork of detail and shading as if it were st
philips itself shrunk to a miniature
he goes to the table dips the brush into the paint and carefully signs his name at the base of the main spire
he sighs deeply lays the brush down on the table and pushes the model towards the window
the movement causes him pain
he puts his left hand up and feels the back of his head
merrick turns out the lamp and goes to his bed
he looks at the cathedral again then around at his room
we see in the dim light his books his gallery of smiling women his dressing bag his cloak and hood and finally his mothers picture on the table
a slight breeze billows the curtains
we move in very close to them
roiling clouds with lightning flashes and low thunder
the sky is in turmoil
when will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye
the clouds are mingling and scattering
when will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky
the clouds erupt pushed onward and onward
they slowly begin to calm as
they turn slowly into
elephants linked trunk to tail moving slowly away from us
when will the clouds be aweary of fleeting
the elephants are calmer than the skies we saw
they keep moving onward and onward
when will the heart be aweary of beating
a lacy curtain has taken the place of the sky
the elephants seem to be moving on it
into the distance
and nature die
knock knock sound
the curtain moves to one side wiping the elephants away with it
there is no terrified audience behind the curtain
there is only light and merricks mother smiling a calm and benign smile
never nothing will die the stream flows the wind blows the cloud fleets the heart beats
the light grows brighter and brighter until we cannot see johns mother anymore
it almost blinds us
nothing will die
