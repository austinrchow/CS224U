the enlish patient the saul zaentz company screenplay by anthony minghella based on the novel by michael ondaatje directed by anthony minghella produced by saul zaentz revised draft th august
copyright the saul zaentz company silence
the desert seen from the air
an ocean of dunes for mile after mile
the late sun turns the sand every color from crimson to black
an old aeroplane is flying over the sahara
its shadow swims over the contours of sand
a womans voice begins to sing unaccompanied on the track
szerelem szerelem she cries in a haunting lament for her loved one
inside the aeroplane are two figures
one a woman seems to be asleep
her pale head rests against the side of the cockpit
the pilot a man wears goggles and a leather helmet
he is singing too but we cant hear him or the plane or anything save the singers plaintive voice
the plane shudders over a ridge
beneath it a sudden cluster of men and machines camouflage nets draped over the sprawl of gasoline tanks and armored vehicles
an officer german focuses his field glasses
the glasses pick out the markings on the plane
they are english
an anti aircraft gun swivels furiously
shocking bursts of gunfire
explosions rock the plane which lurches violently
the woman slumps forward slamming her head against the instruments
the pilot grabs her pulls her back but shes not conscious
the fuel tank above their heads is punctured
it sprays them both then explodes
the man falls out of the sky clinging to his dead lover
the are both on fire
she is wrapped in a parachute silk and it burns fiercely
he looks up to see the flames licking at his own parachute as it carries them slowly to earth
even his helmet is on fire but the man makes no sound as the flames erase all that matters his name his past his face his lover
the pilot has been rescued by bedouin tribesmen
behind them the wreckage of the plane still smoking the arabs picking over it
a silver thimble glints in the sun is retrieved
another man comes across a large leather bound book and takes it over to the pilot
the pilot is charred
his helmet has melted into his head
hes oblivious to this cares only about the woman who crashed with him
he twists frantically to find her
two men pick him up and carry him across to a litter where they carefully wrap him in blankets
the pilot is being carried across the desert
a mask covers his face
his view of the world is through the slats of reed
he glimpses camels fierce low sun the men who carry him
the pilot sees a man squat down beside him takes a date from a sack and begin to chew it
carefully the bedouin eases the mask from the pilots face leaving bandages of cloth and oil but revealing a mouth
he stops chewing and passes the pulped date into the pilots mouth
mouth to mouth
the caravanserai crosses the desert silhouetted against the dunes
the sound of glass of tiny chimes
a music of glass
an arab head appears on a moving table in the desert
it floats in darkness shimmering from the light of a fire
the image develops to reveal a man carrying a giant wooden yoke from which hang dozens of small glass bottles on different lengths of string and wire
he could be an angel
the man approaches the litter which carries the pilot
hes still in the protective reed mask wrapped in blankets
the merchant doctor stands over the burned body and sinks sticks either side of him deep into the sand then moves away free of the yoke which balances in the
support of the two crutches
he puts some liquid in the pilots tongue whose eyes almost instantly begin to roll
then he slowly sets about peeling away the layers of oiled cloth which protect the pilots flesh
the merchant doctor crouches in front of the curtain of bottles and makes a skin cup with the soles of his feet then leans back to pluck hardly looking certain
bottles which he uncorks and mixes in the bowl hed made with his feet
this mixture he uses to anoint the burned skin
next he finds green black paste ground peacock bone and begins to rub it on to the pilots rib cage
all the while he us humming and chanting
the bottles continue to jingle
the sand gives way to trees the jingling bottles to distant church bells as a convoy of twenty trucks red cross vehicles and some supply vehicles snakes along a bumpy
the war in italy is largely over and the allies are moving up the country the wounded and supply lines slowly following
a young canadian nurse hana sits in a truck full of patients
hana pays special care to the patient lying in the stretcher alongside her
this is the pilot now known as the english patient
a web of scars covers the patients face and body
they have the quality of a livid tattoo magenta and green black
the hair has largely gone and the effect is curious lassoing his features the strong nose the eyes liquid
its a warriors face
but he has no physical strength
he coughs violently as the trucks shudders along the road
a jeep pulls out of the line and approaches the red cross truck containing hana and the patient
the horn blows and hana looks out to see it contains her best friend jan
two young soldiers sit up front one driving both grinning
jan signals for hanas attention
theres meant to be lace in the next village the boys are taking me
im not sewing anything else
mischievously you dont have any money do you
just in case theres silk
hana i know you do
hana leans under the tarpaulin holding some dollars
the two hands hers and jans reach for each other as the vehicles bump along side by side
they laugh at the effort
jans gold bracelet catches the sun and glints
im not sewing anything else for you
getting the money i love you
the jeep accelerates away
hana sighs to the patient
suddenly an explosion shatters the calm as the jeep runs over a mine
the jeep is thrown into the air
the convoy halts and theres chaos as soldiers run back pulling people out of the vehicles
hana runs the other way towards the accident until she is prevented from passing by a soldier
and theres still chaos as two sappers arrive on motorcycles
one of them a sikh wears a turban
the motorcycles arrive at the front of the convoy
a nurse mary is helping a doctor oliver attend to the injured driver
the other two bodies are covered with blankets
theres blood everywhere
the sikh and his colleague pull out the paraphernalia of their bomb disposal equipment
kip the sikh lieutenant and hardy his sergeant explore the road ahead of the becalmed convoy using saucer like metal detectors and headsets
kip is young lithe contained utterly focused as they inch along the debris strewn road
he stiffens as he registers metal
with a bayonet he carefully scrapes at the mud caked surface
suddenly a pair of feet walks across his vision as hana hurries past walking carelessly up the road
its so surreal that neither man registers at first and then kip is shouting
stand absolutely still
hardy gingerly follows her footsteps
as he approaches good thats good just stay still for me and then were going to be fine
he arrives at hana
then grabs her
hed like to slap her face
what are you doing
what the bloody hell do you think youre doing
by way of an answer she looks at the ground ahead of her feet
jans bracelet lies in the mud
hardy bends down and collects the mangled bracelet presses it into hanas hands
the convoy is threading through a ruined village passing the souvenirs of war
an overturned vehicle now used as a game by some children dejected refugees tramping along the side of the road
from the end of one of the buildings are hanging half a dozen corpses strung upside down with crude placards denouncing in italian their collaboration with the nazis
hana sees all this as she sits blankly inside the truck the patient swaying alongside her
she puts out her hand to steady him
the convoy is making a pitstop
the trucks are silhouetted in a line
hana helps lift the patients stretcher onto the ground
she bends to him
do you need something
the patient nods
hana gets up to prepare morphine injection from a small kit
touches hana gently conscious of her grief for jans death
are you okay
oh god hana you were like sisters
sighs angrily we keep moving him in and out of the truck
whats the point
well we cant hardly leave him
do you mean leave him
hana has settled down beside the patients stretcher
she draws herself up against the night
on the hill above she can see the outline of a small monastery in the moonlight
shes crying her face a frozen mask
i must be a curse
anybody who loves me anybody who gets close to me or i must be cursed
which is it
the patient laces her fingers into his crabbed hand
hana is investigating the monastery of st
anna wandering through its overgrown gardens past a pond
what sanctuary it seems to offer
hana explores via a gaping hole in a library where the walls have collapsed from shelling
the garden intrudes ivy curls around the shelves
bloated books lie abandoned and theres a piano tiled up on one side
hana presses the keys through the filthy tarpaulin which covers it
everywhere there are signs of a brief german occupation
past the library is a cloisters drenched with silver light
the monastery stairs
hana goes upstairs negotiating a huge void in the stone treads two thirds of the way up
the patients room
she comes across a small chapel with the remains of murals and an altar pressed into service by the germans as a table
hana finds an old bed and a mattress
hana comes out passes a dry water trough
she hears a rustling on the gravel and turns to see a tortoise ambling towards the trough
on cue theres a gurgling sound
the handleless pump is suddenly gushing splashing water everywhere
the tortoise clearly arriving for this enjoys a welcome shower
hana goes to the trough dips her hands into the water
looks around her and makes a decision
the convoy is in the final stages of loading up
oliver passes the vehicles deep in dispute with a determined hana who is carrying some sacks of rice
the wars over you told me yourself
how can it be desertion
its not over everywhere
i didnt mean literally
when he dies ill catch up
oliver hovers as hana adds the rice to a small cache of provisions then lays another blanket over the patient
its not safe here
the whole countrys crawling with bandits and germans and god knows what
i cant allow it
youre not this is natural its shock
for all of us
hana i need morphine
and a pistol
clutching at straws and what if he really is a spy
impatiently he cant even move
if anything happened to you id never forgive myself
a tiny smile
oliver shrugs helplessly
were heading for leghorn
livorno the italians call it
well expect you
two soldiers are helping mary and hana carry the patient into the monastery
hana indicates the stairs
they struggle up the stairs one of the soldiers gasping as he narrowly avoids falling into the void in the stairs
the cot almost tips up at which the patient suddenly speaks his voice cracked and rasping but still clearly aristocratic
there was a prince who was dying and he was carried up the tower at pisa so he could die with a view of the tuscan hills
am i that prince
because youre leaning
no youre just on an angle
youre too heavy
they reach the landing
hana kicks open the door to the in here
the patients room
hana lets mary take the weight while she goes to the bed and pulls away the drapes sending up a cloud of dust
they lower the patient onto the bed
she turns to the soldiers
she shuts the door on them leaving mary staring aghast at the room its faded frescoes its mold its chaos
hana smiles opens a shutter to let a fierce envelope of light into the room
she goes to mary and hugs her
a smaller upstairs room completely bare
as hana tugs off her uniform she looks out of the window to see the departing convoy
a cotton dress goes on over her head and she emerges looking suddenly younger and rather fragile
through the damaged floor of her room she has a a
the patients room
hana walks down to the patients room and stands in the doorway
the patient turns his head to her
he puts up a thumb
on the track a song begins some other time
the song continued in the desert where we find the singer peter madox a weather beaten man who is working on the guts of an battered tiger moth aeroplane
his face is blackened with oil
a second european almasy stands beside him holding tools and a section of the camshaft
madox yanks out a perished rubber hose and holds it up for almasy to inspect
behind them is an encampment some camels foraging in the meager scrub half a dozen black tents of the bedouin guides and servants to the almasy madox expedition
its and the whole continent is full of such expeditions competing with each other pursuing lost treasures sources of rivers hidden cities
dagostino the teams italian archeologist drives towards the plane in one of the expeditions adapted ford motorcars
he gets out carrying a large earthenware water jar
he looks very pleased with himself as he shows the jar to almasy and then passes it to madox
sniffing inside whats this
dont drink it
he reaches for the jug then pours out a little sludge its a brackish and stinks
madox makes a face
i cant guarantee the vintage my friends
i just dug it out of the hill
madox and almasy have seen many such jugs
thats terrific dag
to almasy of a tool toss that up would you
mischievously there are some others
dagostino emerges over the brow of a dune leading madox and almasy
the other members of the team are already there bermann a german photographer and fouad egyptologist from cairo
to almasy astonished my god look at this
they bend to touch the jars literally hundreds of them mostly broken piled on top of each other
bermann approaches them carrying his tripod
ive never seen anything like it
there would have been enough water here to serve an army
gloomily which means were in the wrong place
almasy speaks with a slight but unmistakable european accent
would you stockpile water near to an oasis
there cant be a natural spring within fifty miles of here
or they didnt know of one
so it may not be zerzura still incredible
nodding delighted a pottery hill
a wild goose chase
almasy gives him a look
but madox will have none of it
now we look in the other places
the unmistakable buzz of an aeroplane distracts them
good and here comes reinforcements
base camp at pottery hill
later and a smart new aeroplane a steerman makes a smooth landing on the flat desert
the expedition team drives over to meet the arrivals
almasy is not with them
hes walking apparently not so enthusiastic
a young kissed and newly married couple emerge from the plane
they are geoffrey and katharine clifton
and its immediately clear that katharine is the woman in the plane crash at the beginning of the film
madox makes all the introductions
hands are shaken hellos all round as the couple disembark in their leather flying gear
geoffrey removes his helmet and in what we will come to know as an ubiquitous gesture produces a bottle of champagne and sets off the cork with a flourish
i hereby christen us the international sand club
the party is in the shade of the tents
almasy joins the group
madox nods over to the clifton plane
did you look
beaming at almasy isnt it
wedding present from katharines parents
im calling it rupert bear
we can finally consign my old bird to the scrapheap
almasy smiles and walks on towards the others
clifton count almasy
smiling offering her hand geoffrey gave me your monograph when i was reading up on the desert
stiff thank you
i wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives
a thing is still a thing no matter what you place in front of it
big car slow car chauffeur driven car still a car
joining them and joining in a broken car
still a car
hands them champagne not much use though
romantic love platonic love filial love
quite different things surely
hugging katharine uxoriousness thats my favorite kind of love
excessive love of ones wife
a dry smile there you have me
the morning floods into the room
the patient lies lost in the desert
then a sudden clattering noise disturbs him
hana is dropping armfuls of books into the cavities of the damaged stairs and with others she is improvising new steps
the heavy volumes are perfect for treading on
hana comes in gathers up another armful of books and carries them out to continue her stair repairs
what was all the banging
were you fighting rats or the entire german army
i was repairing the stairs
i found a library and the books were very useful
shes attending to him pulling back the sheets plumping up the pillows
hes short of breath
before you find too many uses for these books would you read some to me
i think theyre all in italian but ill look yes
what about your own book
reluctant my book
yes we can read him
hana picks up the book and hands it to him
then she starts rummaging in her pockets
oh ive found plums
we have plums in the orchard
we have an orchard
she has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth
his mouth works with the pleasure of the taste a little juice escaping from the mouth
hana mops it up
the plumness of this plum
a noise gurgling sound disturbs them
hana comes through the cloisters into the garden as the gurgling increases
shes in time to catch the tortoise arriving once again in the water trough just as it starts to gush with water
she shouts up to the patients open window
bends to the tortois you hear it too dont you
close on the herodotus
the patient opens its cover held together by leather ties
loose papers photographs hand drawn maps and sketches are all collected between the pages
he claws at some water colors which appear to be based on cave paintings figures dark skinned warriors of the stone age some with bows in their hands others with
plumes in their hair arranged in abstract patterns uncannily like those of matisse
some appear to be swimming another is diving
then the patient loses control of the papers and the whole parcel spills to the floor with a crack
a shot rings out disturbing the evening meal
almasy and others go outside
silhouetted on a ridge a group of men sit astride camels
one of them holds his rifle aloft clearly pointing towards the sky means friend
fouad peers at the horizon
european i think with guides
can only see shapes how do you know
frowns yes and i think i know who this is
almasy and madox walk out to intercept the arrivals as the first arab dismounts the procession of camels splaying out as if in collapse
almasy speaks in arabic exchanging the ritual greetings
during this fenelon barnes sole european in this expedition has finally persuaded his camel to sit and dismounts irritably slapping the animal in disgust
shits and roars and complains all day
bypassing almasy and approaching madox of course you have your aeroplane
do you still call yourselves explorers
i assume not
stiffly fenelon barnes
yes i think a sailor can call himself an explorer cant he
or should columbus have swum to america
the arrivals come inside
madox handles the introductions
i think you know all of us except for geoffrey and katharine clifton whove recently come out from england
this is clive fenelon barnes
to katharine i know your mother of course
im also searching for the lost oasis but by more authentic means
of almasy anyway my friend here has a new theory that zerzura doesnt exist
so we may all be chasing windmills
have some food
well its certainly not between here and dakhla
nine days of nothing but sand and sandstorms
i found an ostrich egg and some fossils
isnt zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms
what kind of fossils
ill invite you to my paper at the royal geographical society
are you still a member
he takes a long drink from a bowl of frothing camel milk
i think you know i am
ignoring almasy quite impossible madox
you must know that
if you attempt to cross the sand sea due east of kufra by car youll leave your bones in the sand for me to collect
leaving the tent if you come across my bones i hope youll do me the honor of leaving them in peace
to katharine excuse me
you have my word as a gentleman
watching him leave ive discovered a unique type of sand dune
ive applied to the king for permission to call it the fenelon barnes formation
later supper over the company is entertaining itself
almasy standing outside his tent watches the merriment from a distance
dag is nearing the end of a passionate rendition of puccinis e lucevan le stelle
he sits down to much applause from the others and spins an empty champagne bottle on the sand
it comes to rest pointing at clifton who gets up grinning and plunges into yes
we have no bananas with great gusto
his version involves changing language during each line of the chorus prompted by oui
from the others
song finished much bowing and guying he spins the bottle and it arrives equidistant between fenelon barnes and katharine until with a little nudge from the husband it settles on
katharine gets up awkward
i cant sing
the audience groans but i can tell a story
to almasy who has arrived i might need a prompt
do you have your herodotus
ive noticed you carry it
im sorry what have you noticed
almasy looks uncomfortable
reacting quickly it doesnt matter
i think i can muddle through
okay the story of candaules and gyges
king candaules was passionately in love with his wife geoffrey whistles proudly one day he said to gyges the son of somebody anyway his favorite warrior quietly prompting her daskylus
smiles yes thank you gyges son of daskylus candaules said to him i dont think you believe me when i tell you how beautiful my wife is
and although gyges replied he did find the queen magnificent the king insisted he would find some way to prove beyond dispute that she was fairest of all women
do you all know this story
the men all encourage her to continue her story
and hanas voice continues the story as she reads to the patient who listens eyes closed still in the desert
reading from the herodotus i will hide you in the room where we sleep said candaules
she stumbles over the word
candaules not neurotic candaules
youre laughing at me
im not laughing at you
go on please
when my wife comes to lie down she always lays her garments one by one on a seat near the entrance of the room and from where you stand you
will be able to gaze on her at your leisure
her story continuing and that evening its exactly as the king had told him she goes to the chair and removes her clothes one by one until she stand naked
in full view of gyges
and indeed she was more lovely than he could have imagined
almasy stares at her framed by the velvet black sky
katharine turns to looks at him
but then the queen looked up and saw gyges concealed in the shadows
and though she said nothing she shuddered
the next day she sent for gyges and challenged him
and hearing his story she said this off with his head
death for gazing on that which you should not or else kill my husband who shamed me and become king in his place
clifton makes a face of outrage
for katherine the story has collapsed
she wants it to be finished
so gyges killed the king and married the queen and became ruler of lydia for twenty eight years
an uncomfortable moment do i spin the bottle
almasy shrinks away from the fire disappears into black
to clifton and let that be a lesson to you
hana looks up from the herodotus sees the patients eyes closed
gently touches his face and whispers
are you asleep
and hana closes the book gets up and blows out the lamp
pitch black and then a torch flickers on as almasy enters fenelon barnes tent
he pulls apart his luggage quickly and methodically
he finds what he is looking for inside a trunk a large fossilized branch a collection of stone leaves wrapped in a piece of tarpaulin
then hes distracted by a noise from fenelon barnes bed
almasy stiffens turns to investigate
theres a lump in the cot
almasy eases back the blanket to reveal a young girl no more than fourteen bound hand and foot
he holds the torch to her face
the next morning
almasy and madox prepare to take off
as they talk cliftons rupert bear taxis past them a wave from clifton and katharine
madox is very disturbed by what almasy is telling him
what did you think you were doing in his tent
looking for the fossils
why should we wait until were in london
this girl was probably twelve years old
getting into the plane you shouldnt go into another mans tent
her hands and feet were tied
what did you do
i looked at them
theyre shrubs small trees
and fossilized rock hard
he walks away to the nose of the plane
i was talking about the girl
cut the ropes
i left a note on his blanket
gleefully at the next geographical society i shall await with great interest the announcement of the fenelon barnes slave knot
the girl wouldnt leave of course
her father had sold her for a camel
he turns over the propeller the engine cranks up
both planes are scouting the gilf kebir region
geoffrey flies up alongside madox and wiggles his wings
theyre flying over a distinctive group of granite massifs crater shaped hills
the broken towers of the gilf kebir
almasy is distracted by them
he turns to madox and points down indicating they should explore them
madox gestures to the cliftons to photograph the massifs
a thumbs up from geoffrey
hana gives the patient his injection now she begins to change the sheet
the light streams in from the open window
she looks up at the green hills rolling away from the monastery the village in the distance
i should try and move your bed
i want you to be able to see the view
its good its a view from a monastery
i can already see
bending down to his level how
how can you see anything
not the window i cant bear the light anyway no i can see all the way to the desert
ive found the lost fossils
im turning you
an awkward moment as she rolls him on to his back
he grunts with the pain
she washes him very tenderly
zerzura the white city of acacias the oasis of little birds
as me about the scent of acacia its in this room
i can smell it
the taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth
i can taste it
im chewing the mint
is there sand in my eyes
are you cleaning sand from my ears
thats your drugs speaking
i can see my wife in that view
are you remembering more
could i have a cigarette
are you crazy
why are you so determined to keep me alive
because im a nurse
the tortoise heads towards the trough to the gurgling accompaniment
it reaches the shade only to be greeted by the obstacle of some tennis shoes a frock
it clambers over as the water begins to belch out
hana naked kneeling in the trough receives the shower with a great yelp of shivering joy
its dark but something is going on here
hana is caught by the stray shafts of moonlight
she is scratching something on the flagstones
her skirt is bunched up around her thighs
she throws something in the air
its a spile used to tap into the maple tree for syrup
it lands with a crack
suddenly she is flying across the space a hop a skip a jump
then turns at the other end dips for the stone then back again in this blindmans version of hopscotch
a hospital train ploughs through the night carrying the wounded back to naples
hana walks through a long carriage
her hair is long
she could be ten years younger than the hana at the monastery
she stops at the bunk of a new patient
hana bends to the boy
hes had shrapnel in his legs and cheek
she speaks softly to him
how are you
your leg will be fine
a lot of shrapnel came out i saved you the pieces
youre the prettiest girl i ever saw
she hears this every day i dont think so
would you kiss me
no ill get you some tea
wait till youre in naples
youll find a girl there
innocent just kiss me
it would mean such a lot to me
tender believing him would it
she kisses him very softly on the lips
he closes his eyes
is almost instantly asleep
hana smiles continues along the compartment
voices call out
nurse i cant sleep
would you kiss me
youre so pretty
hinky dinky parlez vous
good naturedly waving away their joke very funny
go to sleep
she gets into a corridor
mary is coming the other way
she carries a blood soaked bundle
hana questions her appalled expression
the train is arriving
hana hangs out of a window scouring the crowds to find her sweetheart stuart mcgann a young canadian captain who seeing her runs up to her window
where are we going
i dont want to be kissing in a crowd
i have six hours
she jumps out of the moving door and into his arms
laughing at her ferocity whoa give me a chance
i took a benzedrine
the station is full of desperate people trying to make do
the couple hurry through oblivious to anyone except each other
ive got a surprise
we can go to capri
its got a cabin its private
id like to spend a night with you in a bed
we can do that when were very very old
hana lies alone in her bed covered by a curtain
theres a sharp noise
shes very frightened
she has her pistol under her pillow and pulls it out listens holding her breath
hana has been reviving a vegetable patch
she comes to garden
crows are feasting
shes furious shouts runs at them
nature wildness insisting on invading her peace
hana appears from the cemetery dragging a metal crucifix
its bigger than she is and she drags it as if approaching calvary
a man watcher her from a bicycle
hes approaching fifty grizzled and attractive and could be italian
his hands are bandaged
hana aims the cross at the soil but is not quite bit or strong enough
the man caravaggio chooses this moment to introduce himself
he drops the bicycle on the ground with a clatter
very cheerful buon giorno
hana turns startled and suspicious
are you hana
what do you want
i met your friend mary
she said i should stop and see if you were okay
apparently were neighbors my house is two blocks from yours in montreal
cabot north of laurier
unraveling this information bonjour
he goes to her and putting a bandaged hand behind her ear produces an egg
he beams as does hana
id like to take credit but its from mary
my names david caravaggio but nobody ever called me david
caravaggio they find to absurd to miss out on
during this he attempts the same thing with his other hand to hanas other ear
the egg drops to the ground
cursing he gets on his knees and starts to scoop it up preserving it
hana has taken his eggs and put them into a bowl
she beats them with a knife picking out the bits of shell
caravaggio watches takes in how little food there is otherwise
the table seems useful more as a sewing area than for cooking its strewn with altar cloths being sewn into drapes
on a tray on the table are two phials of morphine from the patients room
as hana turns to the stove hes moved and covered them with his bandaged hands a second later and hes juggled them into his pockets with the slightest clink
hana looks at him
he shrugs nods at the eggs
i havent eaten an egg in
have you noticed there are chickens
you get chickens in italy but no eggs
in africa there were always eggs but never chickens
who separates them
you were in africa
yeah for a while
so was my patient
id like to stay
thats the long and short of it
i mean you know blah blah if its convenient if theres room blah blah blah
i have to do some work here i speak the language
there are partisans to be trying to paraphrase relieve them of their weapons you know while we hug
i was a thief so they think id be good at that
so you can shoot a pistol
showing his hands no
if you said yes i would have had a reason
you should let me redress those bandages
before you go
look its a big house
we neednt disturb each other
i can shoot a pistol
ill sleep in the stables
i dont care where i sleep
i dont sleep
because were fine here
i dont know what mary told you about me but i dont need company i dont need to be looked at
im not looking
hana carries in a tray
theres omelette on the plate
theres a man downstairs
he brought us eggs
shows him the omelette he might stay
can he lay eggs
brittle why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place
what happened in montreal when you passed a man in the street did you invite him to live with you
he neednt disturb you
im already disturbed
he wont disturb us then
i think hes after morphine
shes cut the omelette into tiny pieces theres a war
where you come from becomes important
and besides were vulnerable here
i keep hearing noises in the night
the patient says nothing
she puts a spoonful of the omelette into his mouth
caravaggio is in the shadows on the stairs
a street market in full sway a locals only affair blazing with noise and bustle and barter
emerging from a thicket of women and begging children katharine clifton carries her purchase of an exotic looking rug
from nowhere she is joined by almasy
how much did you pay
they dont see foreign women in this market
how much did you pay
seven pounds eight i suppose
youve been cheated dont worry well take it back
bristling i dont want to go back
this is not worth eight pounds mrs
i dont care to bargain
that insults them
turning to face him i dont believe that
i think you are insulted by me somehow
youre a foreigner too arent you here in this market
of the carpet i should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this
i apologize if i appear abrupt
i am rusty at social graces
tart how do you find cairo
did you visit the pyramids
he stands as she continues pushing past him shrugging off the children boiling
the long bar
the exploration team are drinking at a table
they are not entirely off duty almasy and madox as ever ponder the maps
geoffrey clifton appears arms waving
gentlemen good evening
he sits down
madox hails the waiter
how is your charming wife
shes in love with the hotel plumbing
shes either in the swimming pool she swims for hours shes a fish quite incredible or shes in the bath
actually shes just outside
responding to their bewildered expressions chaps only in the long bar
standing embarrassed of course
well we should all go out onto the terrace
oh no really
she has her book
i wont hear of it
none of us will
katharine appears with geoffrey to join the arriving explorers
she looks exquisite in her evening clothes
madox brings her to her seat
there is dancing inside and couples walk to and from their tables
katharine manages to produce a dazzling smile which includes everyone except almasy
clifton youll have to forgive us
were not accustomed to the company of women
not at all
i was thoroughly enjoying by book
indicating they should all sit and then nodding at almasy before greeting the others please
signor dagostino herr bermann
the team is in mourning darling
im afraid were not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition
what will you do
a more modest expedition or even wait a year
remind our families we still exist
astonished good heavens are you married madox
very much so
we are all save my friend here
he nods at almasy
clifton appears tremendously relieved
i feel much better dont you darling
we were feeling rather self conscious
lets toast then
to absent wives
toasting katharine and present ones
toasting almasy and future ones
a dance finishes
almasy takes over from dagostino to partner katharine
they dance beautifully
the others remain on the terrace in deep conversation
why did you follow me yesterday
after the market you followed me to the hotel
i was concerned
as i said women in that part of cairo a european women i felt obliged to
you felt obliged to
as the wife of one of our party
sardonic so why follow me
escort me by all means
following me is predatory isnt it
the dance finishes
they walk back to their table where almasy leads katharine back to her seat next to clifton
i was just saying im going to cable downing street see if i cant stir up a few shillings katharines mother and the pms wife are best interrupting darling for
well she is
hana having already replaced the bedlinen is standing on a stepladder trying to hang home made drapes around the bed as caravaggio knocks tentatively then comes in
so youre our canadian pickpocket
he goes to help hana they work as he talks
thief i think is more accurate
i understand you were in africa
oh all over
i kept trying to cover a very modest portion and still failed
to hana are you leaving us
nows our opportunity to swap war wounds
then im definitely going
and she exits
the men consider her
does she have war wounds
as hana walks up her stairs she finds herself overhearing their conversation as it threads up through the hole in the ceiling
she strips her own bed of the curtain she uses for a sheet
i think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her
are you planning to be the exception
youve got the wrong end of the stick old boy
a pause so caravaggio hana thinks you invented your name
and youve forgotten yours
i told her you would never invent such a preposterous name
i told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name
hana is still listening but now shes outside a cabin
shes in her uniform clearing things away
the cabin door is ajar
an officer moves around then sits to make notes
what about your rank or serial number
i think i was a pilot
i was found near the wreckage of a plane by the bedouin
i was with them for some time
bathing cabins on the coast complete with campari umbrellas and metal tables at which are seated the bandaged and the dying and the comatose staring out to sea or in
slow muted conversation
hana walks up to the patients cabin
he is propped up with a view of the sea which is interrupted by the pacing officer
hana has a blanket and a chart for the patients bed
she busies herself
do you remember where you were born
am i being interrogated
you should be trying to trick me
ask me about tottenham hotspur
or buckingham palace
about marmite i was addicted
or make me speak german which i can by the way
are you german
how do you know youre not german if you dont remember anything
you tell me
i remember a lot of things
i remember a garden plunging down to the sea the devils chimney we called it and there was a cottage at the bottom right on the shore nothing between you
this was your garden
or my wifes
then you were married
i think so
although i believe that to be true of a number of germans
might i have a glass of water
hana pours him a glass of water
he notices her
he sips look my lungs are useless makes a small gap with his fingers ive got this much lung
the rest of my organs are packing up what could it possibly matter if i were tutankhamun
im a bit of toast my friend butter me and slip a poached egg on top
hana leaves smiling at the patients irascibility sharing this with the officer who frowns
the interview continues
hana walks between the cabins
stuart steps out of the shade
he is drawn older than last seen
my leave is canceled
i cant meet you later
hana frowns helpless
as if to emphasize this a staff nurse comes by carrying a bowl and a withering look
hana enters approaches the patient
excuse me yes
can i ask my friend can he come in
just for a few minutes
hes going back to the front this evening
i cant see him otherwise
just go off
ill be quite all right
no i cant go but if it if you werent offended it would be very good of you to allow us every other cabin is crammed
this is as private as well get
well then yes
she hurries out returns with stuart
they stand awkwardly
this is captain mcgann
please dont waste your time on pleasantries thanks
im going to sing
if i sing i shant hear anything
and with that he bursts into a raucous coughing version of yes
we have no bananas
he changes language each verse
the couple stand formal then edge round to the back of the bed
touching his lip youve got a mustache
a bit of one
i was looking forward to this evening
whispers i had a hotel room
whispers i thought that was for when we were very very old
im feeling old
they embrace fiercely hardly making a sound or moving
the patient a battered open backed truck comes into the monastery
an italian partisan sits in the back a shotgun resting on his knees
the truck stops and caravaggio emerges from the passenger door
he collects some packages from the partisan including a dead rabbit and then exchanges a few words with the driver
hana whos watching all of this from her garden sees that the driver is a woman
the womans name is gioia and caravaggio leans into the window to make his goodbye to her
caravaggio approaches the vegetable garden as hana comes to greet him
he throws her the rabbit and hurries up the stairs without pausing clutching the other boxes
hana calls after him
whereve you been
not stopping rabbit hunting
hana looks at the rabbit
caravaggio hasnt been around for a week
hana heads up for the kitchen then stops as theres a faint crash from upstairs
hana the rabbit still in her hands comes along the corridor to find caravaggio slumped on the floor retching
the discarded needle lies beside him the new package of morphine capsules ripped open
he looks up at hanna glazed
i could help you
i could get you off that
can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life
she bends starts clearing up putting the morphine phials back into the box
its a week
we didnt know where you were or if you coming back or of the drugs you should be happy
what were you going to do for him when it ran out
he pulls out more phials from his jacket
what do you do
what are you doing here
some gave me a dress
starts to tear at a parcel you know whats great
what im learning
you win a war and you not only gain the miles you get the moral ground
everywhere i go were in the right
i like that
hana comes in carrying a batch of the new morphine
shes wearing a different frock
its not new and its faded but the change of color is startling
something smells so rich
my stomach is heaving he came back he says he caught a rabbit
im cooking it
thats a different dress
he keeps asking me questions about you
do you know him
do you recognize him
do i recognize him
i recognize what he is
i like him
he can read italian
he can catch rabbits
almasy squats with an ancient arab outside his rudimentary house while he draws on the sand talking in some arcane dialect scratching out a possible location for the lost oasis
the man stops speaking and scours the sky a beat or two before we or almasy hear the faint noise of a plane
its cliftons steerman rupert bear coming in to land
almasy doesnt look up
the arab continues to talk
the newly arrived katharine has scrambled up the hill to speak to almasy
not to interrupt but were celebrating
she makes to leave but almasy puts up a hand to keep katharine there but quiet
this is an incredible story about a man hunting an ostrich hes been telling me about zerzura he thinks hes been there but his map the route hes describing he
couldnt survive the journey now but hes a poet so his map is poetry and now were onto an ostrich
to the arab in arabic im telling her your map is poetry
the arab shrugs
what do you mean poetry
a mountain curved like a womans back a plateau the shape of an ear
sounds perfectly clear
where does the ostrich come in
the ostrich is a detour
a poor man hunts an ostrich its the method
nothing to do with zerzura
to catch an ostrich you must appear not to move
the man finds a place where the ostrich feeds a wadi and stands where the ostrich can see him on the horizon and doesnt move doesnt eat otherwise the ostrich
at nightfall he moves fifty sixty yards
when the ostrich comes the next day the man is there but hes nearer
to the guide haunting the ostrich
the guide speaks amplifying something picking at his robe
yes the ostrich it will feed a family not just the meat but by selling the feathers beak the skin a year from this one animal
so each day the man gets closer
and the ostrich is not sure has something changed
now the standing man is only a few yards from where it feeds
and then one day the man is in the wadi in the water
and the ostrich comes as always dips into the water and the man jumps up and captures it
the arab has more to say
almasy doesnt respond quieting him with a dismissive gesture
what is he saying
almasy awkward shakes his head come on what did he say
he said be careful
you mean you or me
to the arab her or me
the arab speaks again
almasy speaks without looking at her
the one who appears not to be moving
katharine comes in
then a beat and almasy
clifton is holding up the champagne
gentlemen to zerzura
and a special thank you to geoffrey and katharine without whose fund raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels
they toast the cliftons
to arm twisting
to almasy did katharine say
geoffrey has to fly back to cairo
have to return the favor take a few photographs for the army
darling peter says i could stay
checking with almasy why not
what kind of photographs
the brigadier the brigadiers wife the brigadiers dogs the brigadier at the pyramids the brigadier breathing
to clifton why do you think
about my staying
well look if nobody minds truly then i suppose i shall of course be bereft
playfully poking his ribs oh
but finally able to explore the cairo night life
i shall produce an authoritative guide to the zinc bars and i want to say harems am i in the right country for harems
as clifton prepares to leave in the steerman almasy approaches
clifton your wife do you think its appropriate to leave her
i think the desert is its for a woman its very tough i wonder if its not too much for her
are you mad
katharine loves it here
she told me yesterday
all the same i were i you i would be concerned ive known katharine since she was three my aunt is her aunt we were practically brother and sister before
we were man and wife
i think id know what is and what isnt too much for her
i think shes know herself
laughing it off why are you people so threatened by a woman
he settles into the controls
almasy watches the plane taxi away
doesnt move at all
katharine waves from the tent as the steerman takes off
basecamp at pottery hill
the three ford cars leave the campsite loaded for a scouting expedition
the rest of the party bedouin tents camels and tiger moth is left behind
madox shouts last minute instructions from the window of his car
fenelon barnes sits astride his camel and wipes away the sweat
the desert stretches for miles shimmering the sun baking the sand
his guides wind their headcloths tighter
then one of them looks round raises a hand
a buzzing noise
they all turn
a small cloud of dust emerges over a ridge
a caravan of cars the almasy madox expedition bumps along suspensions threatened by the constant dips and ridges
on each car there are three in the passenger cabin the open backs crammed with drums of gasoline and water and equipment
on the front vehicle the tenth member of the party kamal acts as a navigator and sits on a camel saddle a rodeo cowboy on the roof of the leading
car driven by madox
as they spot fenelon barnes they sound their horns and wave good naturedly
f b scowls watches them roar by stealing his thunder
desert en route to cave of swimmers
one of the cars is hopelessly bogged down in heavy sand
its contents have been unloaded and a rope ladder is being inserted under the tires
the entire company huff and puff and argue about the best means of extricating the vehicle
later almasy drives the second car accompanied by katharine and al auf
katharine breaks the long silence
ive been thinking about how does somebody like you decide to come to the desert
what is it
youre doing whatever youre doing in your castle or wherever it is you live and one day you say i have to go to the desert or what
almasy doesnt answer
katharine who has looked at him for an answer looks away
theres another long silence
i once traveled with a terrific guide who was taking me to faya
he didnt speak for nine hours
at the end of it he pointed at the horizon and said faya
that was a good day
point made they lapse again into silence
actually you sing
all the time
i do not
ask al auf
almasy asks al auf in arabic
he laughs nods
sings wickedly ill be down to get you in the taxi honey youd better be ready about half past eight
al auf nods and grins furiously joins in impersonating almasy
almasy grunts in irritation
the group is investigating a cleft in the rocky massif
they climb slowly
below them a new and temporary base camp
the group winds around the rock
almasy turns to offer a hand to katharine behind him pulling her up to the next rock slab
she smiles at him
he smiles back curtly continues
the group stops at a level plateau
the arabs stand apart and sing their prayers at dusk
al auf leads the incantations
allahu akbar allahu akbar
the westerners wait respectfully
as the sun sets in glory almasy looks over at the range of rocks
one particular range seems to look exactly like a womans back
he squints at the rock
almasy discreetly pulls out his compass
almasy clambers up the rocks coming through a narrow crevice to find a natural shelf
he scrambles up this path reaching up only to notice that his hand almost perfectly covers a painted hand on the rock and as he digests this he realizes he
has climbed past what is the mouth of a cave
he disappears inside
a flashlight squirts into the cave
almasy treads cautiously along the narrow winding passage
he comes to an open cavern and takes his flashlight up to a wall
paintings emerge figures animals ancient pictures
men with bows and arrows
almasy is astonished by what he sees
the others watch as a flashlight bobs and jerks among the rocks as almasy comes scrambling down transformed into an excited teenager
he slithers in a heap in front of the astonished expedition party
almasy has led the whole party into the heart of the cave
now madox comes alongside him at the wall his flashlight joining almasys and increasing the visibility of the paintings
a dark skinned figure apparently in the process of diving into water comes clearly into view
then others supine arms outstretched
with audible excitement my god theyre swimming
the others crowd round
five excited faces in the green gloom of the a hive of activity
the team has set up trestles to catalogue the finds as the bedouin come out with baskets of detritus which they empty onto a growing heap as the cave is
entering the cave almasy passes with camera equipment just as dag emerges carrying the corpse of a perfectly preserved desert fox
dag gestures to almasy with his customary enthusiasm holding up the body of the fox
have you seen this
inside bermann is setting up lamps running wires from a car battery
kamal is helping him
and as almasy arrives he catches a tiny moment of tenderness between them
bermann seeing him quickly disengages and busies himself with the lights
at another wall katharine is catching
the cars are heading back to basecamp
they bounce over the sand
bermann is driving the lead car along some steep dunes
almasy beside him
bermann is peeling an orange a segment of which he holds out of the window
kamal riding shotgun leans down and collects it his head dipping in to grin at bermann
bermann looks uneasily as almasy
he wants to tell him of his passion of his absolute love for kamal but he darent
i love the desert you see
thats my thats my i cant think of the word
almasy nods how do you explain
to someone whos never been here
feelings which seem quite normal
compassionate i dont know my friend
i dont know
bermann holds out another segment of the orange and watches the slim brown hand collect it
a momentary distraction is all it takes for him the car lurches sideways and topples over the edge
dag following fouad beside him brakes sharply but cant stop his own car from being caught in the avalanche of sand and it plunges down the dune and into bermanns
upturned car with an ominous crunch the radiator exploding
only madox katharine beside him and a little way behind manages to stay clear of the trouble
he jumps out of the vehicle and slides down the dune to find pandemonium as the passengers stumble out of the cars sand flying smoke pouring from the upright vehicle
the wheels of the overturned car spinning wildly in the air a puddle of oil spreading ominously
later and the group have cleaned up as best as possible
dag bermann and fouad are a little worse for wear
fouads arm is in a sling and dag is sporting a bloody head bandage
bermann has broken a finger and is being attended to by madox
the luggage water and petrol have been stacked up and the men are loading up the remaining car
almasy is working at the crumpled end of the vehicle
hes having no success
almasy kamal and two of the other young bedouin stand around the mess of the two broken vehicles
the one working car is loaded with men and provisions
katharine sits inside next to madox almasy comes over to her window to speak past her to madox
ill be back as quick as i can
thirty six hours at the outside
try to get a second radiator well bury it between here and the pottery hill
and a better jack
we planned badly
nods at almasy then shouts over to the wrecked vehicles bermann
this is bermanns cue to take leave of kamal who is staying behind
kamal makes a little bow
may god make safety your companion
bermann nods and hurries away squeezing into the car which jolts off bouncing over the track
i shall stay behind of course certainly not
there clearly isnt room for us all im the least able to dig and im not one of the walking wounded
those are facts
besides if i remain its the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever hes doing and rescue us
its hard to argue with this logic
later the madox car makes a more effective departure
and almasy and katharine are left alone
they look at each other as if realizing this for the first time
almasy immediately returns to the two damaged vehicles and helps the men stretch the cut canvas which was once a tent to fashion a makeshift shelter between the two cars
katharine goes to join them
there is no obstacle to the remorseless horizon just miles of undulating dunes
almasy sits alone writing into his herodotus a map folded in front of him from which he makes notes
katherine comes across with a clutch of her sketches from the cave wall
hands them to him
i thought you might paste them into your book
we took several photographs theres no need
id like you to have them
handing them back theres really no need
this is just a scrapbook
i should feel obliged
exasperated and that would be unconscionable i suppose to feel any obligation
of course it would
shes already turning walking as far from him as the cramped shelter permits
he continues with his maps
katharine sits alone on top of the dune smoking surveying the landscape
below her the makeshift camp a fresh wind flicking at the tarpaulin the deep tracks of madoxs car stretching off towards civilization
almasy emerges from the tent and locating katharine heads towards her
you should come into the shelter
im quite all right thank you
look over there
katharine turns scans the horizon
what am i looking at
see whats happening to them the stars
theyre so untidy
im just trying to rearrange them
in an hour there will be no stars
the air is filling with sand
he offers a hand
a little reluctantly she takes it
the team hurries around the improvised tent weighing it down with packing cases gasoline drums water cans bringing anything loose or light inside the tarpaulin
the wind is whipping up the air busy with sand
almasy pushes everyone under cover
the sand seems to be scouring the tarpaulin
kamal and almasy try to secure one vulnerable area but suddenly there are leaks everywhere and the sand swarms inside
its noisy too and almasy has to shout to make himself understood indicating to the bedouin to grab water and blankets and food all the valuables and get out
he himself finds blankets and water and shouts at katharine to do the same
one side of the canvas suddenly rips apart like paper
chaos as figures struggle in ever worsening conditions sand blizzarding the air
the shelter flies into the air stranding the figures their heads wrapped in blankets flashlights useless
they seek safety in two groups the tribesmen to the cabin of the overturned car katharine and almasy to the upright one
inside the cabin the sand swirling around them katharine and almasy sit without speaking
dawn is trying to break through
he pours a little water into a mug so that they can wash out their eyes and noses and mouths
she takes her silk scarf and first dries her eyes with it then dries his
this is not very good is it
shall we be all right
yes is a comfort
absolutely is not
the sand is piling up against the two cars the tent is swept from its moorings the water cans are hurled up too and then plunge ominously into sand drifts
as if going under an ocean
let me tell you about winds
there is a whirlwind in southern morocco the aajej against which the fellahin defend themselves with knives
the ghibli from tunis rolls and rolls and produces a rather strange nervous condition
and we hear katharines laugh
almasy sits alongside katharine whose head is against his shoulder
he continues his story of winds
which mariners called the sea of darkness
red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of england producing showers so dense they were mistaken for blood
almasy checks to see if katharine is still awake
we had a house on that coast and it never rained blood
herodotus your friend tells of a wind the simoon so evil that a nation declared war on it and marched out to fight it in full battle dress their swords
the sand has almost completely engulfed the car on the exposed side covering the windshield like snow and encroaching onto the door of the protected flank
almasy is woken by sound of a distant engine
he jerks up waking katharine in the process and heaves against the door
he cant open it and has to lean his feet against the passenger door lying across katharine kicking it open
by the time almasy emerges from the car the sand pouring into the cabin madoxs car is roaring along the horizon
almasy waves shouts and then runs back into the car finds his flare gun and sends a flare high into the sky
katharine is with him now and they watch helplessly as the car bounces away from them madox a man on a mission
katharine panics the sand has erased all traces of them
she speaks quietly shocked
our tracks where are they
almasy is preoccupied
hes gone back to their vehicle and returns with a shovel starts to dig frantically
madox will have calculated how many miles theyll soon turn around
realizing what hes doing oh my god the others
she kneels with him and helps to shovel away the sand which has completely engulfed the other vehicle containing the three bedouin
during this could i ask you please to paste you paintings into my book
i should like to have them
i should be honored
is it am i a terrible coward to ask how much water we have
shoveling hard water
yes we have water we have a little in our can we have water in the radiator which can be drunk
not at all cowardly extremely practical
anxious at not uncovering the boys egging himself on come on come on
then back to katharine theres also a plant ive never seen it but im told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the
next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid
find that plant
cut out its heart
they hear noises scrabbling faint thumps
almasy scrapes at the sand and they find the glass of the car
the angle of the cab tilted up to the sky has made it impossible for the trapped boys to lever it open
their oxygen is rapidly deteriorating
almasy pulls the door and it cranks open
katharine sits in the car putting her pictures into the herodotus
its full of almasys handwriting photographs some pressed flowers
she deciphers a page of his words and drawings
its almost exclusively about her the lines studded with k
she reads astonished then looks at him as he and two of the three bedouin circle the area of the cars in ever widening circles like water diviners like kip
searches for mines
kamal is slumped against the front of the car
almasy suddenly drops to his knees and begins to shovel into the sand
he pulls out a can of water
turns to katharine and holds it triumphantly in the air
theres a small weak fire
the group crouch around it
the boys talk noisily to almasy
kamal is wrapped in a blanket and shivering
almasy gives him water speaks to katherine
kamal is passing blood
he must have had some internal damage in the crash
he needs medicine
i think we must risk the other flare
he gets up and loads the flare with what is clearly the last charge
this time the effect is dramatic with a red umbrella of light
katharine comes up beside him
they wait hope fading with the flare
blank geoffreys not in cairo
almasy looks at her hes not actually a buffoon
and the plane wasnt a wedding present
it belongs to the british government
they want aerial maps of the whole north africa
so i think hes in ethiopia
in case you were counting on his sudden appearance
and the marriage is that a fiction
theres a beat
katharine has a hundred answers
no the marriage isnt a fiction
the light from the flare fades on them and they stand in the dark
suddenly on the far horizon behind their heads an answering flare fireworks into the sky
oh thank god
theres excited shouting from the two fit boys
they leap up and run towards the couple who meanwhile have realized that the flare has not come from madox but from an approaching camel caravan
almasy shouts to the boys for some identification
do they know them
squinting at the horizon no but i think i do
the caravan slowly comes into focus
its fenelon barnes
katharine touches almasys arm an almost imperceptible gesture
am i k
in your book
i think i must be
almasy turns to her
he runs the blade of his arm across her neck the sweat leaving a clear stripe
fenelon barnes approaches dismounts from his camel and addresses almasy
i recollect your saying to ignore your bones but i assume you have no objection to my rescuing your companion
to katharine good evening mrs
accepting his handshake hello
id like to introduce you to my camel the most notable beast on earth
to almasy i understand you found some remarkable caves
a goatskin bag of water is offered to katharine
she drinks and hands it to almasy
paintings of swimmers
another world as a honking taxi containing almasy and katharine negotiates the incredible bustle of cairo
almasy still in the same clothes and evidently weary emerges from the cab and pulls katharines belongings from the trunk then holds open the door for her
as she walks towards the hotel he hands her bag to a porter
katharine is stung
will you not come in
will you please come in
a beat mrs
clifton katharine turns disgusted
i believe you still have my book
katharine fishes the book from her knapsack shoves it at him then disappears
almasy lying on a camp bed face down
the walls are covered with maps enlargements of photographs
a fan whirs over his kit which is spread unraveled but ordered on the stone floor
an ineffably male room the shutters closed just the thinnest shaft of light piercing the gloom
almasy hasnt even removed his clothes his boots kicked off below his jutting feet
theres a knock at the door
hes roused from the dead
stumbles to his feet opens the door as the knocking continues
shes bathed luminous stands back lit by the afternoon sun an angel in a cotton dress
she walks past him into the room
he closes the door
he kneels before her head at her thighs
shes crying her face expressionless as her hands go to his head
you still have sand in your hair
she starts to beat on his head and shoulders violently
he pulls back to look at her the tears streaming down her face
she kneels and covers his face with kisses
he pulls blindly at her dress and it rips across her breasts
almasy is in the bath
katharine wearing his dressing gown pours in a jug of steaming water
almasy leans over the rim of the bath
hes sewing carefully repairing the torn dress
im impressed you can sew
you sew very badly
you dont sew at all
a woman should never learn to sew and if she can she should never admit to it
close your eyes
laughs that makes it harder still
she pushes the sewing from his hands then pours water over his head then begins to shampoo his hair
almasy is in heaven
the biggest smile we have seen from him
she continues to massage his scalp
when were you most happy
when were you least happy
a beat now
and what do you love
what do i love
i love rice pudding and water the fish in it hedgehogs
the gardens at our house in freshwater all my secret paths
she rinses his scalp then slips off the robe and climbs in beside him covering his neck and shoulders in kisses
baths not with other people
i could go on all day
a beat my husband
what do you hate most
what do you hate most
when you leave you should forget me
she freezes pulls herself away out of the bath looks at him then slaps him very hard across the face
she picks up her dress the thread and needle dangling from it and walks dripping out of the room
to the patient its as if katharine is walking out of his wall
he sighs with pain then looks away to where hana has fallen asleep on the bed almost on top of him
he touches her
he speaks as if each word burns him
could i ask you to move
im sorry but when you turn the sheets i cant really bear the sheets moving over me
mortified moving quickly yes of course im so sorry
stupid of me
hana gets up upset to have hurt him
im so sorry
hana comes to the table carrying a jug of water and a bowl
shes still sad
she unbuttons her dress pulling it off her shoulder begins to pour the water to cool herself against the nights pressing heat
the emergency field hospital is a cluster of tents practically ahead of the front line sporadic gun fire light and heavy sounds throughout
mary walks by on her way to the nurses tent
its and the war in italy is still intense
jan is washing out of her helmet and stands naked in her socks
hana is using a flannel to wash jans back
a couple of other girls like exhausted on their cots
the mud is everywhere
another nurse is making tea out of an adapted plasma can on their tiny primus
mary comes in and flops down
shes given blood and is pale and enervated
okay type os the vampires wait
everybodys giving a pint
if they were sucking it out i wouldnt mind
its the needle i cant stand
laughing youre a nurse how ca you be frightened of needles
hana walks through the main triage tent
its packed with the ruined bodies of the injured swaddled in bloody bandages
hana stops at a couple of beds shares a word or two with the patients
she stops at another bed leans over its occupant
his bandaged face is bloated and yellow
hes not breathing
she bends over him his open eyes fixed in a glassy stare
she snaps the triangular cardboard id from his bed to indicate hes died
then tenderly closes his eyes
cant wait to have me dead
he slaps her hand away
slaps at the tubes going into his arm
hana is absolutely shocked
but just as suddenly hes sunk back into semi consciousness
shaken she sits by him and takes his hand he pulls it away she takes it again
he is in terrible pain
his face creased with anger
now his hand is clutching at hers
she tries to soothe him
try t be calm
be calm now
his face stills
his hand loosens
now he has gone
as hana inspects him a shell seems to land close by
the lights flicker
she ducks along with everyone else
below the bed on slatboards above the mud are the now dead soldiers possessions
they include a pair of tennis shoes
hana wearing the tennis shoes is giving blood
she lies in a cot next to jan
the shelling sounds closer
oliver the doctor is working on the most recent patient a young canadian boy who is critically ill the tubes hanging above him of plasma and of blood
the curtain drawn around him is pulled back to reveal the two nurses in the background
the soldier can just see them
hes going to die any minute
whispering to oliver is there anybody here from picton
i dont know
id like to see somebody from home before i go
hana can only really hear olivers end of this conversation but the mention of canada chills her and she knows now not later that stuart is dead
to oliver why picton
hes from there edge of lake ontario right soldier
the boy nods
innocent wheres your stuart from
somewhere near there isnt it
to oliver as him what company hes with
oliver leans over then turns to hana
third canadian fusiliers
does he know a captain mcgann
the boy hears this whispers to oliver
he bought it
shot to bits
the shells are getting closer
what did he say
cant look at her doesnt know him
everybody is on the floor struggling to get on a helmet
hana lies down the blood still leaving her her helmet on
oliver is next to her in the mud
her heart is breaking
hes gone hasnt he
the shells pound them incredibly loud drowning out her grief but each explosion illuminates it for a moment
caravaggio comes into the kitchen
hana is slumped at the table her back naked
the jug of water in front of her
shes sobbing her shoulders heaving
caravaggio approaches tentatively
he touches her shoulder hana
are you alright
without raising her head dont touch me if youre going to try and fuck me
soothing ill have some of your water
she reaches for her blouse wraps it around herself
her face is read with weeping
gently you have to protect yourself from sadness
this is the thing ive learned
drinking the water youre in love with him arent you
do you think hes a saint or something
because of the way he looks
i dont think he is
im not in love with him
im in love with ghosts
and so is he
hes in love with ghosts
who are his ghosts
he holds up his hands what if i told you he did this to me
how could he have
im one of his ghosts and he wouldnt even know
its like he slammed a door in cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in tobruk
i dont know what that means
shrugs ask him
ask your saint who he is
ask him who hes killed
furious please dont creep around this house
hana sits reading from the herodotus
she shows the patient the page where a christmas cracker wrapper covered in handwriting has been glued in
tell me about this this is in your handwriting december nd betrayals in war are childlike compared with our betrayals during peace
new lovers are nervous and tender but smash everything for the heart is an organ of fire
she looks up i love that i believe that
to him who is k
k is for katharine
a christmas party for the troops
the incongruous attempts to create a traditional christmas in the dusty heat of cairo
the party is in the courtyard of the moorish palace which serves as the private residence of the british ambassador sir ronnie hampton
lots of wives including lady hampton and katharine help serve tea and cake to the soldiers who sit at rudimentary tables with paper plates and paper hats
a man dressed as santa claus is giving out presents penguin paperbacks chocolate
music blares out from a loudspeaker
officers and civilians walk the parameter
one of these arriving is almasy
he sits in the shade catches katharines attention
katharine brings him over a cup of tea and a plate with christmas cake on it
say youre sick
say youre feeling faint the sun
but a frisson no
i cant work
i cant sleep
lady hampton calls impatiently
to almasy i cant sleep
i woke up shouting in the middle of the night
geoffrey thinks its the thing in the desert the trauma
i can still taste you
waving at another woman who pushes a trolley with teapots this is empty just coming
im trying to write with your taste in my mouth
as she leaves swoon
ill catch you
almasy sits watching the party
the santa claus is dragged outside by some excited children
almasy picks at his cake removing the thick marzipan icing
hes writing on a christmas cracker wrapper smoothing it out december nd
betrayals in war are childlike compared with out betrayals du
katharine attending to a raucous table suddenly sags at the knees and swoons
people rush to her
helping her to her feet its the heat
you should sit down darling
to the others shes quite all right
escorts katharine away are you pregnant
i dont think so
squeezing her arm how romantic
with fiona i fell over every five minutes
ronnie christened me lady downfall
i think i might go inside and sit down for a few minutes
ill come with you
i shall be absolutely fine
they pass almasy who doesnt look up from his book
a small storeroom inside the palace brooms mops cleaning equipment
outside the party is visible as opaque shadows through the beveled glass of the ornate window
the sound of carols sung by the enlisted men gives way to a version of silent night played on a solitary bagpipe
inside almasy and katharine make love in the darkness
everything is too fast desperate standing up grabbing hoisting clothes
almasy appears and almost immediately collides with the man dressed as santa claus
he moves to one side
have you seen katharine
taken aback what
its geoffrey under this
i havent no
side room in ambassadors residence
geoffrey continues scouting the warren of tiny rooms that run off the central courtyard
he finds katharine sitting in one smoking surrounded by oppressive and elaborate tiling
clifton wonders briefly how almasy had missed katharine
darling i just heard
you poor sausage are you all right
i got hot
lady h said she thought you might be im not pregnant
im too hot
taking off his hat and beard come on ill take you home
cant we really go home
i cant breathe
arent you dying for green anything green or rain wouldnt you die to feel rain on your face
its christmas and its all i dont know if you asked me id go home tomorrow
if you wanted
sweetheart you know we cant go home there might be a war
poking at his costume geoffrey you do so love putting on a disguise
i do so love you
he kisses her head what do you smell of
i think youve got marzipan in your hair
no wonder youre homesick
the patient lies alone in his room
cliftons face stares back at him from among the frescoes
then something distracts him
are you outside
a beat and then caravaggio shuffles in
like an old boxer
i cant hide anymore
jerks up his hands i breathe like a dog
i lose my balance
stealings got harder
caravaggio stares at the herodotus
why do i feel if i had your book i would know everything
i dont even know if it is my book
the bedouin found it in the plane in the wreckage
its mine now
i heard your breathing and thought it might be rain
im dying for rain of course im dying anyway but i long to feel rain on my face
caravaggio comes close scrutinizing the face trying to repair the features
is it you
if i said moose
i look different fuck why shouldnt you
a different tack first wedding anniversary what do you call it
i dont know
sharp not wanting to think i dont remember
hana stands at the piano
its still lop sided propped against the wall
she tries but cant move it
so she pulls off the dust sheet and with the instrument still on a tilt begins to play the aria from bachs goldberg variations
hanas piano continues
upstairs caravaggio chats with the patient while working his arms to raise a vein a boot lace tied around it preparing an injection for himself tapping the syringe
during this i have come to love that little tap of the fingernail against the syringe
gun shots punctuates the music
shes totally engrossed and only hears the second or third shot
her hands falter she looks up to see a sikh soldier running across the field waving his arms his revolver held aloft
he approaches the door his face creased with anxiety and raps on the shattered frame
she gets up and walks past kip standing at the door and continues the seven or eight feet to the right and out into the garden via the hole excuse
of the doors i dont have the key to that door
the germans were here
the germans were all over this area
they left mines everywhere
pianos were their favorite hiding places
then mischievous then may be youre safe as long as you only play bach
kip is looking around the piano
is something funny
no but no not at all
you came to the doors thats all and a little laugh worried about mines
ive met you before
i dont think so
hana bends to see what kips looking at under the piano
wires run from the wall to the instrument onto which is taped an explosive charge
if hana had succeeded in moving the piano she would have triggered the charge
kip looks at hana who conceals her dismay with a shrug
the monastery garden
across from the terrace hardy and kip are putting up their tents
caravaggio stands chatting amiably to them holding a haversack smoking a cigarette
hana looks down from the patients room watching the tents go up
he wants us to move out says there could be fifty more mines in the building
he thinks im mad because i laughed at him
hes indian he wears a turban
if he wears a turban hes a sikh
kip glances up at the window
hana suddenly shy backs away
ill probably marry him
my mother always told me i would summon my husband by playing the piano
she goes over to the patients bed
i liked it better when there were just the two of us
is he staying
with his sergeant
we should charge
doesnt anyone have a job to do
they have to clear all the local roads of mines
thats a big job
they wont stay in the house
theyre putting up their tent in the garden
in that case i suppose we cant charge
a small office shared by two men and a mountain of filing cabinets and paper
there are aerial maps all over the walls
clifton is on the telephone while his colleague rupert douglas works at the desk
into the phone darling its me im sorry somethings come up
katharine responds dont sulk ill be back tomorrow evening
katharine responds okay my precious i love you
rupert makes a face at his friends sentimentality
i didnt know you were going anywhere
im going to surprise her
its our anniversary
shes forgotten of course
whats the symbol for your first anniversary
i should get something
is it paper
he knocks sharply on the wall moose
moose you there
first anniversary is it cotton
is what cotton
first wedding anniversary
of clifton hes hopeless
your day will come my sausage
your first anniversary is paper
the approach to the shepheards hotel
geoffrey clifton in a taxi champagne between his knees
the car ahead of them screeches to a halt as a woman hurries across the street
the driver honks his horn angrily
the woman puts up a hand in apology as she skips across the street to another taxi
its katharine shes dressed for a date carries flowers an overnight bag
geoffrey at first excited is troubled by the accouterments
then he sees katharine skip and his whole being punctures
katharines cab roars off
his own car jerks forward
geoffrey sits in the cab
fifty yards short of the hotel
the world rushes by
he finds a cigarette
katharine is in bed
almasy has just put a record on
its the folk song heard at the beginning of the film
he slips back under the covers
their clothes are scattered around the room
he lies over a happy katharine
this is what is this
its a folk song
no no its hungarian
my daijka sang it to me
as they listen its beautiful
whats it about
as if interpreting its a long song szerelem means love
and the story theres a hungarian count hes a wanderer a fool
for years hes on some kind of quest who knows what
and then one day he falls under the spell of a mysterious english woman a harpy who beats him and hits him and he becomes her slave
he sews her clothes he worships the hem of katharine had thought for a few seconds he was serious then she catches on and starts to beat him
see youre always beating me
you bastard i was believing you
they embrace he lies over her considering her naked back
i claim this shoulder blade oh no wait i want this
he turns her over kisses her throat then traces the hollow indentation
this whats it called
this place i love it this is mine
katharine doesnt know im asking the king permission to call it the almasy bosphorous
teasing i thought we were against ownership
kissing him i can stay tonight
the luxury of this makes them both sad
almasy rolls away on to his back
madox knows i think
hes tried to warn me
he keeps talking about anna karenina
i think its his idea of a man to man chat
its my idea of a man to man chat
this is a different world is what i tell myself
a different life
and here i am a different wife
a different wife
the cab driver is asleep
a loud pop
jerks him awake
in the back of the car geoffrey has opened the champagne
he lets it overflow then takes a swig
he notices the startled driver and puts up an apologetic arm
two or three children knock on the window begging
geoffrey knocks back violently
hotel now sir
and he throws a silencing wad of money onto the seat by the cabbie
almasy and katharine wander out of his building and into the early morning streets hand in hand
the morning prayers rise out from the citys three minarets
almasy stops at a stall which is just preparing to open for the day
he picks up a silver thimble points at it to the merchant who gives him a price
without comment almasy produces the money and beaming hands the thimble to katharine
i dont care to bargain
she smiles its full of saffron just in case you think im giving it to you to encourage your sewing
that day had you followed me to the market
you didnt need to slap my face to make me feel as if youd slapped my face
loving him but frightened shall we be all right
katharine takes leave of almasy on the street corner away from the hotel entrance
they dont kiss theres no demonstration of feeling
he turns immediately away and disappears
geoffrey unshaven watches as katharine crosses the street and heads towards the hotel
his expression is terrible trying to smile his face collapsed
cheek to cheek leaks into the room from a gramophone that caravaggio stands over proudly
the patient opens his eyes is confused dislocated stares blankly at caravaggio
grinning thought youd never wake up
hana comes in sleepily frowns at the gramophone
where did you find that
i liberated it
i think thats called looting
relaxed no one should own music
the real question is who wrote the song
is there a song you dont know
speaking for him no
he sings all the time
she goes over to the patient and kisses him gently
of his singing did you know that
youre always singing
ive been told that before
kips another one
she goes to the window looks over to where the tents are pitched sees hardy shaving kip in the process of washing his hair his turban hanging like a ribbon
between two trees to dry
hes perched a bowl on the sundial and is dipping his long coal black hair into it
as hana watches kip caravaggio changes the record
the patient identifies it immediately
hana walks past the tent and passes hardy
shes carrying a small cup which shes a little furtive about
hes carrying a whole armada of oil lights
he nods upstairs
i was going to say if you want to eat with us ever
you and lieutenant singh
very kind of you we can always eat in the town with the others since caravaggio turned up food seems to appear so please
ill ask the lieutenant
but thank you
you saved my life
i havent forgotten
hardy waves that away i thought you were very very tall
you seemed to big a giant and i felt like a child who cant keep her balance
does a little mime a toddler she goes on and tentatively approaches kip whos still working at his hair
kip hears her and puts out an inquiring arm moving towards her like a blink man through the curtain of hair
he touches her
sorry is it all right im seeing this
my hair was long
at some point
ive forgotten what a nuisance it is to wash
you know if you were ever around we get water from the pump at noon
he continues to wash
she holds up the cup of oil
i found a great jar of it
in naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife
she stands for a second then walks away
kip examines the oil calls after her
for my hair
turning smiling yes for your hair
hana is gardening close to the crucifix which is now a full fledged scarecrow
broken bottles fragments of stained glass and shards from a mirror are hung from the crossbar syringes too all jangling and tinkling and catching the sunlight
kip and hardy drive off to work on their motorcycles
she watches them catching kips careless wave to her
she looks briefly at herself in a piece of mirror dangling from the scarecrow
hana walks along the landing with a tray
theres a message on several doors in the corridor from kip safe then a couple with the warning danger
she hears noise from the patients room
listens for a second before going in
because youre reading it too fast
not at all
you have to read kipling slowly
your eye is too impatient think about the speed of his pen
quoting kipling to demonstrate what is it he sat comma in defiance of municipal orders comma astride the gun zamzammah on her brick
what is it
during this hana comes through with the tray finds kip perched on the window relishing his skirmish with the patient who has condensed milk dribbling down his neck
brick platform opposite the old ajaib gher natives called the lahore museum
its still there the cannon outside the museum
it was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax then melted down
then later they fired the cannon at my people comma the natives
so what do you really object to the writer or what hes writing about
what i really object to uncle is your finishing all my condensed milk
snatching up the empty can and the message everywhere in your book however slowly i read it that the best destiny for india is to be ruled by the british
hana we have discovered a shared please the boy and i
arguing about books
condensed milk one of the truly great inventions
grinning leaving ill get another tin
hana and the patient are alone
i didnt like that book either
its all about men
too many men
just like this house
you like him dont you
your voice changes
i dont think it does
a beat anyway hes indifferent to me
i dont think its indifference
kip comes bounding in with a fresh can
hana was just telling me that you were indifferent appalled hey
well im indifferent to cooking not hanas cooking in particular
stabbing at the tin with a bayonet have either of you ever tried condensed milk sandwiches
caravaggio and the patient are singing an arab song which they both know from cairo days
thunder accompanies them
suddenly the door is flung open and hana kip and hardy appear
they have the stretcher with them
a whoop precedes the headlong rush of kip hardly and caravaggio as they cart the patient across the cloisters like manic stretcher bearers
hana is with them holding an umbrella over the patient who bounces uncomfortably
he is nervous a little giddy
the rain buckets down
no irony careful careful
the monastery garden
the storm tour includes a trip around the pond
the patient pushes away the umbrella lets the rain drench him
he grins at hana
this is wonderful
to hana whats he saying
hes saying its wonderful
madox and almasy are camped in one corner of the library hunched over their maps and papers and journals and clashing furiously over the site of the next part of
pushing away his charts and im telling you theres nothing there to explore
no because you cant see from the air
if you could explore from the air life would be very simple
he yanks up a map look
what is that
is that a wadi
that whole spur is a real possibility
which weve overflown twice
which we couldnt explore because of rocks because of cross winds its sloppy
stabbing another location and here and here we could be staring at zerzura
other readers look over at this unseemly skirmish
so on thursday you dont trust bells map bell was a fool bell couldnt draw a map but on friday hes suddenly infallible
almasy is surprised by madox anger
and where are the expedition maps
in my room
those maps belong to his majestys government
they shouldnt be left lying around for any tom dick or mary to have sight of
whats the matter with you
dont be so bloody naive
you know theres a war breaking out
he tosses a slip of paper onto the map recites its message this arrived this morning
by order of the british government all international expeditions to be aborted by may
almasy and madox walk down this busy and rather narrow street without pavements
both of them somber
why do they care about our maps
what do we find in the desert
arrow heads spears
in a war if you own the desert you own north africa
contemptuous own the desert
almasy hesitates at a junction clearly about to take leave of madox
that place at the base of a womans throat
you know the hollow here does that have an official name
madox looks at him
for gods sake man pull yourself together
the open air cinema is just beginning its evening programme
pathe news begins and we date the event to april
stories of imminent war jostle with images of merrie england
village greens sporting victories crufts dog show
alone among the necking couples mostly soldiers with their egyptian girlfriends in an otherwise empty block is katharine
shes waiting for almasy
a soldier comes over to katharines row and settles a couple of seats away from her
beggin your pardon miss but have you got a lighter
katharine lights his cigarette and returns to the screen
an item about fred astaire and ginger rogers and top hat
the stars do their stuff
the soldier moves a seat nearer
leering i love ginger shes a foxy girl aint she
you heard me
the soldier slinks off muttering
katharine is wretched
she sits head down not watching the screen marooned in her despair about duplicity sordid assignations
almasy arrives slides in beside katharine his shadow momentarily large across the screen
they watch the screen
katharine is weeping
almasy doesnt understand
he puts his arm around her
i cant do this i cant do this any more
a man walks round with a hand bell announcing that the park is closing
he turns off the gaslights which illuminate the animal cages
almasy and katharine sit stiffly on a bench
they dont speak
almasy puts his hands to his head he rubs his shoulders
the lights are gradually being extinguished around them
finally katharine gets up
id better get back
she keeps him away with a hand say goodbye here
im not agreeing
dont think im agreeing because im not
they stand awkward
katharine rehearses her position
the bell clangs
i just know any minute hell find out well barge into somebody well and it will ill him
dont go over it again please
he takes her hands lays his cheeks into them then releases them gets up walks away
she walks towards the gate
he calls after her
katharine he walks towards her his smile awful
i just wanted you to know
im not missing you yet
she nods cant find this funny
then she turns sharply from him and catches her head against the gatepost staggers at the shock of it then hurries away
hana sits with the english patient the room shuttered against the morning light
his breathing is noticeably worsening a shudder of a breath the shallow rise and fall of his chest perceptible
hana frets touches his wrist feeling for the pulse
im still here
youd better be
dont depend on it
that little bit of air each day theres less of it which is al right which is quite all right
she squeezes his hand suddenly overwhelmed
brightly ive been talking to caravaggio my research assistant theres meant to be a ghost in the cloisters
i can join him
theres some kind of noise from the garden
its the boy
hana goes to the window opens the shutters
the day pours in
hana sees kip barely visible standing at the far perimeter of the garden in the olive groves his hands raised above him his leg held out strangely
wires run from his foot in all directions as if hed trodden in some elaborate steel cobweb
hana appears at the edge of the olive groves and hurries towards kip who hasnt moved
he shouts warning her
go to the left
keep to the left
there are mines and trip wires everywhere
hana stops hoists up her skirt and circles left tentative in the long grass
he shouts doesnt want her close
hes on the other side of town
in the hills
get him to hurry
she keeps coming can see that he needs her
its okay ill help
the mines the wires theres a trick
some explode if you stretch the wires some if you cut them
what do i do
theres a mine here but the others are far enough away i think at least to give me a chance
i have to work out which one to cut before i fall over
so i follow the wires
you get hardy
i follow the wires
she kneels at his feet and tries to trace the tangled route of the web
dont touch them
she follows one wire back to the closest mine and traces another back to kips foot
then she finds another one leading off to a second mine some thirty metres away
why would anyone do this
ive done this
ive had to do this
then hanas suddenly tense
give me a second
she turns and tiptoes right through the danger area straight to what had seized her attention
kip is appalled
what are you doing
heedless she dodges another mine and its web of wires just as the tortoise clambers onto a clump of rock which is in fact another hana snatches him up as
he ambles towards the metal
she turns holding the protesting animal in triumph
her foot snags on a wire
she has to ease it off in arabesque still clutching the tortoise
she goes sideways to the safe zone setting down the animal
then shes back with kip
she is strangely elated
what is this business with you and explosives
do you think youre immune
i promise you that was the right thing to do
hes my good luck
she gets the pliers from his belt and hands them to him now cut
she indicates the wire i hope we dont die
get away from here
im not scared
so many people have died around me
but i would be a shame for us
shrugs i dont feel like being shy
you must get away
before i cut
im not cutting if youre here
hes going to topple over if he cuts
actually you cant cut can you
youll fall over
give me the pliers
but he hands them over
before i cut
just in case
lie flat and then cut
hana checks lies down
he bends as close to the ground as he dares the patient lies in bed
hes agitated by the silence
suddenly theres an explosion
he tries to shout a croak which quickly reduces him to coughing and breathlessness
he tries to move
footsteps as someone hurtles up the stairs
shes ashamed to have forgotten him
she rushes to him
i forgot youd be worrying
were all safe
it was a mine but not the mine
she calms him
his eyes shine
hana clings onto kip as the triumph motorcycle hares along the circling road
she has her arms around his waist
his head turns to her for a second and she smiles
kip and hana have been detained at a road block
kip is being questioned at a sentry post his papers over thoroughly inspected and accompanied by several meaningful glances at hana who waits standing by the motorcycle
one of the soldiers saunters over and returns her papers
and youre definitely traveling with him of your own free will
clearly disapproving just wanting to be sure
and hes taking you to church
were going to a funeral
a cow has died
and in his religion theyre sacred
the soldier isnt sure what to make of this
he signals to his companion who returns kips papers
kip walks back to the motorcycles
he says nothing
he kicks the starter
hana gets on slides her arms lovingly around him
its getting dark
the bike headlights on crosses a bridge
kip has strapped on his crimson emergency light as they sail along the winding crest of mountain ridge that is a spine down italy
kip steers the motorbike into the deserted piazza
they dismount and kip starts to unbuckle his bulging satchel and unload the panniers
hana still doesnt know whats in store and looks questioningly at kip as he walks up to the door of the church
they enter the church
its in almost total darkness
then a flare suddenly illuminates the interior
kip holds the flare crimson on one arm green pouring up from the other
hana walks behind him still perplexed
there is protective scaffolding a second flare
kip has appeared through a secret door high in the church literally emerging from one of the frescoes which are momentarily visible
he flings a rope over the rafters
now kip circles hana with the rope making a sling across her waist and shoulder
he lights a smaller flair and hands it to her before disappearing
hana stands holding the flare
she cant see kip can only hear him scrambling
he runs up the sandbags right up into the rafters
he collects the other end of the rope which is attached to hana
holding onto it he just steps off into the darkness
simultaneously hana is swung up into the air her startled yelp echoing around the church
kip touches ground while hana swings through space coming to rest about three feet from the frescoed walls painted by piero della francesca
hanas flare makes a halo around her head
now kip on the ground still holding the rope walks forward and causes hana to swing to the right
she lets out a giddy laugh exhilarated and nervous and she flies illuminating en passant faces bodies angels
kip guides the rope as if they were making love which in a way they are
hana arrives hovering in front of the queen of sheba talking to solomon
she reaches out to touch the giant neck of the sad queen
kip slowly lets her down paying out the length of the rope
hanas face is full of tears
he smiles holds her
caravaggio is with the patient
he sits in the window
fiddles with the bandages of his hands
there was a general who wore a patch over a perfectly good eye
the men fought harder for him
sometimes i think i could get up and dance
whats under your bandages
caravaggio goes to him holding out his hands the bandage ends trailing
hold the ends
the patient holds them
caravaggio walks backwards the bandages unraveling and unraveling
caravaggio thumbs intact and wearing a crumpled linen suit walks through the mangled corridors of british hq
smoke is rising from buildings the ominous scream of stuka dive bombers in the distance as the harbor is pounded the steady thud of explosions
tobruk is under siege
bhq is a place in the throws of dismantling itself
secretaries are visiting braziers manned by arab boys who stoke the fires as boxes of papers are fed into them
ashes hover in the air
caravaggio walks through a large room crowded with desks
from one of them a young woman aicha kisses him frowning at the chaos and the shelling
hes waiting for you
some doors are open revealing men and women in uniform urgently shredding documents
caravaggio knocks at an office whose door is ajar and where the incumbent fenelon barnes is stripping the room of his personal possessions photographs stone branches a cricket bat
fenelon barnes office
barely looking up what a bloody flap eh
i heard from alexandria this morning apparently no one there is accepting british pounds
and if you pick up a telephone everybodys practicing their german
holds up some gramophone records what do you do do you take these things
then awkward look moose we need you to stay in tobruk
a bit of a short straw but the thinking is well be back i mean we will be back but
and in the interim we need eyes and ears on the ground
a big bomb lands nearby
the building shudders and plaster dust drops from the ceiling
almost oblivious the two men head out of the office
fenelon barnes lugs the trunk last glimpsed in his tent by almasy until caravaggio takes over
fenelon barnes and caravaggio make their way down the stairs and to the entrance
we have troops in tobruk
what are they going to be doing
continuing to pack giving rommel a bloody nose
thats my suggestion
but did you hear the bbc last nigh
tobruk is of no strategic importance makes you wonder
aicha is at the bottom of the stairs
she falls into step
jerrys got our maps you know
before the war we helped them run about the desert making maps and now they get spies into cairo using our maps theyll get rommel into cairo using our maps
the whole of the desert like a bus route and we gave it to them
any foreigner who turned up welcome to the royal geographic take our maps
madox went mad you know you knew peter madox
after he found out hed been betrayed by his friend
absolutely destroyed the poor sod
shot himself in a church in dorset
caravaggio opens the door fenelon barnes goes through
the fenelon barnes trunk is taken from caravaggio and joins the pile of luggage and artifacts which wait to be shipped out
id like to get that bastard almasy settle the score eh
thats my fantasy said he clearing out
must have been a spy all along
a german troop carrier rumbles forward passing a line of bedraggled british pows as theyre marched along the side of harbor
tobruk ruined quarter
a hill of salvaged army boots is being explored by a couple of german soldiers in search of better footwear
below them the pows trudge by one of them barefoot
one of the germans tosses down a pair of boots then continues his own perusal
a crowd of tobruk civilians french and italians among the mostly arab faces
their papers are being thoroughly checked by officers sitting at open desks
in a line wearing his shabby suit is caravaggio
an arab woman in front of him is arguing over the identity of her ominously caucasian looking child
an interpreter mediates
the officer doesnt believe the woman
shes getting frantic at the possibility of losing her child
suddenly theres a disturbance as a woman is dragged along the line by her hair
shes bloodied and has been tortured and its hard to recognize her as the pretty aicha
she touches a couple of people in the line
soldiers pull them away
caravaggio doesnt look stares straight ahead
an officer watches him as he caravaggio runs bolts for cover vaulting the rubble which blocks one corner of the square
the congregation throws itself to the ground until the square has only standing soldiers and a running man
interior of ruined building
shots pursue caravaggio as he disappears behind the rubble then bobs up again as he darts inside a blasted building
he clambers up some ruined stairs heaves over the wall
facade of ruined building
caravaggio grabs a metal bar on the facade of the building from which he hangs looking for the next foothold
soldiers appear along the top of the building shouting rifles ready
an officer arrives and stops the soldiers firing and the others begin to laugh as caravaggio hangs from the bar fifteen feet above a balcony slowly losing his strength
another soldier waits for him in the balcony below
now he starts to laugh
caravaggio is slumped at a table his hands manacled to its thick wooden legs
theres a telephone at another table in the corner of the room attended by a clerk with a stenographer working next to him
the room has stone walls which appear damp and no windows
soldiers stand guard at the door
its a horrible room
caravaggio is trying to sleep hes unshaven and pasty looking
his interrogator muller seems incredibly tired and aggravated
hes on the phone
in german yes yes yes yes yes
he slams down the phone and comes back to the table
petty thief six months imprisonment kingston penitentiary
barely with humor i keep explaining
youve got the wrong man
my name is bellini antonio bellini
bellini caravaggio both painters i think that is confusing you
muller doesnt even pay attention hes going through a file

and so was this august
and this february
i was buying or selling something
ive been to cairo many times

the phone rings again is answered
the clerk calls to muller who gets up irritably
caravaggio addresses the room
could i have a doctor
i am passing blood
i must be bleeding internally
to the clerk can you get a doctor
look he spits onto the table theres blood in his mouth im leaking blood
he indicates a guard he kicks me
he kicks me all the time
muller is irascible on the phone checking his watch negotiating time
the call finishes
in german hes asking for a doctor
to caravaggio you want a doctor
yes ive been asking for weeks a month i dont know also my leg was we dont have a doctor but we do have a nurse
well sure a nurse is great
muller nods at the clerk who instantly gets up
just then the telephone rings again
in german leave it and get the nurse
the clerk exits
the phone rings
the stenographer is plagued by flies
suddenly he slaps at one
snapping why is there so much nose
i cant hear myself think
turns to caravaggio look give me something
so we can all get out of this room
wiping his face its too hot
i slept with the girl
ive got a wife in tripoli
a girl comes up and points at you you only see trouble
the nurse comes in
she is arab and her head is covered
ill tell you what im going to do
this is your nurse by the way
shes moslem so shell understand all of this
whats the punishment for adultery
lets leave it at that
youre married and you were fucking another woman so thats is it the hands that are cut off
or is that for stealing
does anyone know
muller turns to caravaggio
well you must know
you were brought up libya yes
dont cut me
or was it toronto
ashen dont cut me
now the phone starts again
the clerk picks it up theres a terse exchange he puts the receiver on the desk waits for the moment to interrupt muller
how about this
you give me a name for every finger doesnt matter who
i get something you keep something
im trying to be reasonable
fenelon barnes we could call that two names
pauses suddenly puzzled are thumbs fingers
in german to the others is a thumb a finger
muller opens his palms to caravaggio
i get no help from these people
in german the telephone muller walks over takes the receiver and slams it down
an air raid siren is going off somewhere and now the faint sound of explosions is also discernible but all muffled in this room with the steady clack clack of
at that moment muller suddenly becomes aware of what is happening
he turns on the stenographer
in german what are you doing
awkward in german that geneva convention
im muller peremptorily rips out the paper throws it on the floor
you cant do that
hey come on
during this mullers gone to the table pulled out a drawer and produced a cut throat razor
he hands it to the nurse makes a line across his own left thumb and jerks his head towards caravaggio
the nurse is extremely reluctant
muller claps his hands pushes her towards caravaggio
caravaggio is in terror
oh jesus christ
the guards come away from the door and press down on caravaggios shoulders to prevent him from moving
the nurse grim faced approaches kneels at the table
as she prepares to cut listen ill give you a name
what name did you say
i knew them
and then he screams and screams and jerks up carrying the guards and the table with him all heaving off the ground the nurse thrown off balance
he falls to the floor roaring with pain blood everywhere the table on top of him
the air raid is continuing outside the phone is ringing the nurse stands pale blood all over her uniform
cut the other thumb
he stabs at his own right thumb
the nurse horrified shakes her head
muller snatches the razor from her and heads towards the prostate caravaggio
one guard has got to his feet and grips caravaggio around the neck in half nelson others holding his legs while muller approaches
caravaggio cant move
hes gurgling as the guard almost strangles him
his eyes are streaming with tears
now muller is at his other hand and the roar of pain again lifts caravaggio to his feet the whole table rising in the air his mutilated hands slipping from
the handcuffs lie houdini the drawers of the table spilling their contents everywhere before he sinks to his knees like a gored bull and blacks out
later and caravaggio comes round
his eyes open and then his face spasms with pain
he looks down at his ruined hands then realizes hes alone on the floor of the room the papers still scattered the table on its side
he gets up and staggers out of the open door and up the stairs
the corridor is deserted but the body of a german soldier sprawls on the stairs leading up to daylight
outside caravaggio can hear fighting
caravaggio walks unsteadily along the roof of the building
grey and yellow gusts of smoke and the rat ta tat tat of machine gun fire accompany him and theres the sound of vehicles screeching and people shouting nearby but
no visual clues as to whats happening
caravaggio stands in front of the bed holding up his naked hands to the patient like a man surrendering two flaps like gills where his thumbs were
the patient reaches out to take his hands and gently lowers them
caravaggio finds his bandages start to wrap them back round his fists
the man who took my thumbs i found him eventually hes dead
the man who took my photograph i found him too that took me a year
another man took that man across the desert to cairo
now i intend to find him
the lights from the motorbike approaching the monastery its growl
caravaggio goes to the window and watches as kip and hana arrive
last seen at the troops christmas party the inner courtyard has been transformed into an elegant outdoor banquet with band
the almasy madox team is assembled for a farewell dinner
they are waiting for almasy to arrive his seat conspicuously empty
he is very late
and then hes there dangerous drunk terribly dashing
he practically dances to his chair which he drags violently away from its position opposite katharine
he bows to lady hampton
i believe im rather late
ignoring the drama of this entrance good were all here
a toast to the international sand club may it soon resurface
the international sand club
raising his glass misfits buggers fascists and paedophiles
god bless us every one
the others drink trying to ignore his mood
mustnt say international
sorry whats your point
ignoring the remark and the people here dont want us
are you kidding
the egyptians are desperate to get rid of the colonials
to an embarrassed fouad isnt that right
their best people get down on hands and knees begging to be spared a knighthood
to his host sir hampton isnt that right
ronnie hampton shrugs
theyre all very uncomfortable
almasy glares at clifton
whats my point
standing up oh
ive invented a new dance the bosphorus hug
anybody up to it
come on daggers
lets eat first
the band is now playing manhattan almasy without missing a beat begins to sing replacing the words with alternatives he knows
he lurches around
katharine cant look at him
well bathe at brighton the fish well frighten when were in
your bathing suit so thin will make the shellfish grin fin to fin
those were the words actually before they were cleaned up
could be a song for you mrs
clifton a perfect english accent madox gets up and pulls almasy into his chair taking charge
look either shut up or go home
darkly absolutely right shut up
lashings of apologies all round
later now most of the group are dancing
we see katharine dancing with rupert douglas enjoying herself
bermann is there and even madox jogging and grinning foolishly
clifton looks at katharine who as the dance ends excuses herself to go to the cloakroom
almasy hovers in the shadows unseen
katharine comes along the familiar warren of rooms and corridors and is suddenly confronted by almasy tortured and out of control
why did you hold his collar
mimicking her inflection what
that boy that little boy you were holding his collar gripping his collar what for
would you let me pass
is he next
do you drag him into your little room
where is it
is this it
dont do this
ive watched you on verandahs at garden parties at the races how can you stand there
how can you ever smile
as if your life hadnt capsized
you know why
he tries to hold her
she resists dance with me
dance with me
i want to touch you
i want the things which are mine
which belong to me
do you think youre the only one who feels anything
is that what you think
some women flushed with dancing turn the corner on the way to the ladies room
they collect katharine in their train and leave almasy to fall back into the shadows
hana sits with the patient
his eyes are full of tears
he opens them sees her watching over him
why dont you go
wiping his eyes you should sleep
would you like me to
she gets up touches his hand then leaves
hana leaves the room then turns and sees a tiny lamp on the floor its made from a snail shell and oil
she bends to it curiously then sees a second lamp half way down the stairs then a third further down
she smiles in the light then follows the trail
in the cloisters the trail of shell lamps continues like tiny cats eyes
as they reach the hopscotch chalk marks they outline the squares
hana hopscotches and then follows the light disappearing round a corner
hana comes through into the stables
the lamps lead her then they stop
she peers into the shadows
she turns to the voice
he steps out of the darkness
and he goes to her
hardy knocks cautiously on the door of the stables
eventually hana opens the door
i was looking for the lieutenant singh
only we have to go to work
ill tell him
what is it
is it a mine
at the viaduct
she closes the door then reappears
does he have to go
what if you couldnt find him
hardys bewildered sergeant not today please
not this morning
kip comes to the door winding his turban
am i needed
im afraid so sir
kip hurries to his tent
hana follows him
i can love a coward i cant love another dead man
this is what i do
i do this every day
and hes ready hardy having wheeled out their motorcycles
he gets on his and theyre away hana hardly able to look
the bombs huge lbs and protrudes ostrich like from the pit its nose sunk into a pool of sludge at the base of the viaduct
kip steps off and sinks knee deep in mud grunting in disgust
warily he touches his huge opponent feeling the condition of the case
he wipes the metal
reveals a serial number calls it out to hardy whos perched on the bank
serial number kk p
hes hypnotized by the number kk p a bomb with his name on it
hana cycles along on caravaggios bicycle
a tank comes roaring up behind her then a second and a third loaded up with people citizens and soldiers and children waving flags and gesticulating
she lets the metal circus go by
back in the shaft kip works away his fingers shaking with the cold from the oxygen hes using to freeze the fuse
suddenly theres a violent tremor
the ground is shuddering and the bomb slips horribly
kip grabs at it helplessly as if trying to stop a man from falling instead it falls on him pushing him into the sludge
the tanks are rumbling towards the viaduct
horns start sounding
hardy below bellows at his men above for explanation
dont know what its about
god only knows
incredulous what is this a bloody carnival
three sappers run across the bridge towards the oncoming procession
they wave their orange flags the tanks wave back wit their flags stars and stripes union jacks
now shots are ringing out
in the shaft oblivious kip slides out from under the bomb the oxygen spurting everywhere all over his clothes hissing on the surface of the water
hardy bends into the shaft heedless of his own safety
youve got to cut sir that frost wont last
this is making me incredibly angry
he rubs his hands to warm them up locates his needle pliers and slips them through the tiny gap
his hand touches the casing and the freeze burns his hand
he jerks back dropping the pliers into the sludge cursing
now hes on his hands and knees in the sludge trying frantically to find the pliers
hardy looks at his watch he cant help
the seconds run out as kip grovels in the mud
totally submerged he suddenly comes out with the pliers goes straight to the fuse no finesse and cuts
theres a snip
then kip laughs at hardy
hardy is already at the winch hauling it up
kip can hardly clip on the halter his hands numb and burned
as the pulley jerks he just clings on rising from the grip of the mud like an ancient corpse out of a bog
the other sappers have gathered around the edge of the site
great elation on their faces
get a blanket
not getting attention dade
get the lieutenant a blanket
its over sarge
to kip sir congratulations
kip shakes his hand
kip shakes hardys hand
and now theyre all shaking hands and slapping backs and the soldiers from the tanks are there and the victory celebrations begin
kips blank drained not taking anything in as dade wraps a blanket around his shoulders
hanas on top of the viaduct watching as kip is wrapped in his blanket the men celebrating
she shouts with relief from the top of the bridge
the gramophone plays frank sinatra
kip sits in the window the shutters open the village lit up behind his head nodding to the music sucking out of his condensed milk
elsewhere there is an open bottle of cognac some wine
the patient has a beaker of wine
caravaggio is dancing with hana
kip come and dance with me a sly wobble of the head yes
caravaggio swirls past the patient nodding at the cognac
have a drink
ive had a drink
well anything you do is likely to be fatal so you know very true
a tiny piazza where the sappers and the villagers are having their own more raucous victory feste
there are accordions theres dancing and theres hardy stripped to some exotic underpants a large tattoo doris inside a heart clambering up the equestrian statue in the middle of the
hes astride the horse and now straining to get up to the tip of the outstretched sword so that he can hang the union jack flag he has in his
blackler one of the sappers is hardys assistant
hes drunk and slips from his ladder falling flat on his back into the fountain with a great splash to much hilarity
hana and caravaggio are still dancing
the music has stopped
caravaggio changes the record
hana goes to kip for a second beaming before caravaggio has snatched her away again
the patient taps along to the music
who knows the bosphorus hug
never heard of it
that was a dance we invented at the international sand club
you and madox
or you and katharine clifton
a small laugh what
theres a muddled thud in the distance kips ears prick up
he glances for an instant out of the window
anxious of the noise what was that
she is spinning with caravaggio
when she comes round again kip has gone
kips motorbike skids into the tiny piazza
a military ambulance is already there
dade and spalding are presiding as the paramedics take two bodies into the rear of the truck
the shattered fountain the sluiced flagstones shining wet and slick give some clues as to whats happened as do the elderly standing in the shadows the distressed girls arm in
one girl young and quite striking is particularly inconsolable her grief sobbed out at the doors of the ambulance
spalding salutes kip who waves his salute away just wanting to know what happened
they was running up the union jack sir up off that statue it just went off
should have been me
it was my idea but sergeant hardy climbed up sir him and blackler
kip goes to the ambulance
spalding tries to stop him
sir you dont want to look
kip steps into the back of the ambulance bends over both bodies does look then comes out past the weeping girl
whos that girl
his fiancee sir
kept it a bit dark
kip has pulled out all of hardys gear
now he starts on the tent
hana comes out into the step
kip turns his eyes brimming sees her sighs then turns back and kicks at the pegs collapsing the tent
now hes trying to fold a shirt
hana takes it from him
she folds it
then together they start to fold the tent kip orchestrating not wanting to talk
finally kip looks at hana stiff with emotion
i was thinking yesterday yesterday
the patient hardy theyre everything thats good about england
i couldnt even say what that was
we didnt exchange two personal words and weve been together through some terrible things some incredulous he was engaged to a girl in the village
i mean looks at hana and us he never once
he didnt ask me if i could spin the ball at cricket or the kamasutra or i dont even know what im talking about
you loved him
caravaggio reading dante aloud in italian smoking walks over to the window looks out
hana is approaching kips tent carrying a light
she ducks inside the tent and the light disappears
the patients room
caravaggio turns back into the room towards the patient still reading
hana lies over kip unraveling his turban slowly sensual
if one night i didnt come to the tent what would you do
i try not to expect you
but if it got late and i hadnt shown up
then id think there must be a reason
you wouldnt come to find me
kip shrugs that makes me never want to come here
but she continues unraveling the turban
then i tell myself he spends all day searching in the night he wants to be found
the expedition team is packing up the basecamp
madox and almasy are loading things into the plane
fouad al auf and others work at the cars
had a letter from my wife
the wisteria is still out which im looking forward to
she says dorset is gripped with invasion fever
wrong coast i should have thought still
bermann thinks hell be interned poor fellow
im going to do what i can but
and dag turns out to be a great admirer of mussolini
so now you can say i told you so
i told you so
we didnt care about countries
brits arabs hungarians germans
none of that mattered did it
it was something finer than that
thanks for the compass
ill look after it for you
shrugging this off whens clifton picking you up
ill be ready
ill leave the plane in the hangar at kufra oasis
so if you need it
hard to know how long ones talking about
we might all be back in a month or two
madox kneels and takes a handful of sand puts it into his pocket
he throws his haversack into the plane then turns
almasy puts out a hand
this is a moment of great emotional weight for them both conducted as if nothing were happening
i have to teach myself not to read too much into everything
comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all
goodbye my friend
they shake hands
may god make safety your companion
a tradition there is no god
smiles but i hope someone looks after you
madox clambers into his plane then remembers something jabs at his throat
in case youre still wondering this is called the supasternal notch
almasy nods goes to the propeller
come and visit us in dorset
when all this nonsense is over
then shrugs youll never come to dorset
the plane roars into life
almasy watches it taxi away then heads back to continue with his packing up
madox shoots himself behind the altar in the room
the patients stertorous breathing each intake accompanied by a small noise a note suddenly stops
then steadies again
he appears to be alone
kip is in the tent looking out of the flap waiting for hana
kip walks in looking for hana
the patients room
kip enters sees hana is not with the patient hears his uneven breathing then goes out
from the shadows of the room caravaggio shifts position
hes slumped on the floor staring at the man prone in the bed
into her bedroom kip cant find her there either
he turns to go walking down the wooden stairs until her voice stops him in his tracks
shes in the shadows of the eaves
sometimes i need you to find me
the patients eyes open to see caravaggio at the morphine
hana tells me youre leaving
preparing the injection there are going to be trials they want me to interpret dont they know im allergic to courtrooms
we shall miss you
he delivers the injection
the patient sighs
caravaggio takes off his jacket
a pistol is stuck in his waistband
the patient sees it
so i come across the hospital convoy holds up the syringe i was looking for this stuff and some nurse mary hanas friend tells me about you and hana hiding
in a monastery in purdah whatever it is retreat he administers his own injection using his teeth grip the sleeve how youd come in from the desert and you were burned and you didnt know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession picks it up full of letters and cuttings and then i knew it must be you
id seen you writing in that book
at the embassy in cairo when i had thumbs and you had a face
and a name
before you went over to the germans before you got rommels spy across the desert and inside british headquarters
he took some pretty good photographs i saw mine in that torture room in tobruk so they made an impression
and you thought youd come and settle the score
you were the only man who knew the desert well enough the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing
i had to get back to the desert
i made a promise
the rest meant nothing to me
what did you say
the rest meant nothing to me
there was a result to what you did
it wasnt just another expedition
holds up hands it did this
if the british hadnt unearthed your nosey photographer in cairo thousands of people could have died
thousands of people did die just different people
but you were among the british they were your friends why betray them
a bitter laugh is that what you thought
that i betrayed the british
the british betrayed me
the british betrayed me
almasy sits on a ridge transferring map of information from his herodotus onto a sheet of paper
he looks up at the sound of cliftons approaching steerman
he folds up the map and sticks it inside one of cliftons champagne bottles and lodges it between the rocks
clifton is flying the steerman up to gilf kebir
from the air its possible to make out almasy scrambling down from the ridge towards where the stones indicate a landing area carrying the last of the materials from the
cave of swimmers
almasy waves in recognition and welcome
almasy watches as the plane drops towards him shielding his eyes against the sun
the plane bounces along the runway not quite landing
almasy continues packing the equipment
almasy looks up to see the plane swerve now suddenly heading straight towards him
hes completely vulnerable nowhere to run
he dives at the ground
the plane smashes against an invisible ridge and turns over and over the wings snapping off like twigs as it hurtles past the prostrate almasy
he gets to his feet and starts to run towards the wreckage
a blue line of smoke is uncoiling from the plane but no fire
almasy pulls away the debris to find geoffrey slumped neck broken bloody
he tries to move him and in the process reveals to his absolute horror katharine staring grimly ahead unable to move
oh dear god katharine what are you doing here
eyes rolling an incredible weariness i cant move
i cant get out
almasy starts to pull at the wreck around her
why did he bring you
a surprise he said
almasy inspects clifton tries to find a pulse
the smoke circles around them
katharine looks at her husband
he must have known all the time
he was shouting i love you katharine i love you so much
is he badly hurt
his neck is odd
almasy puts his arm around katharine to try and pull her clear
she cant stand the pain
please dont move me
it hurts too much
weve got to get you out of here
it hurts too much
cant bear to hurt her i know darling im sorry
the smoke thickens
he pulls hard the pain from which causes katharine to gasp then pass out
they slip haphazardly to the ground cushioned a little by the sand
he lifts her gently into his arms and carries her from the danger of the place then turns and runs back
the plane suddenly erupts in flames
almasy dashes into the fire disappearing into the smoke before emerging with clifton over his shoulder firemans lift style
he has wrapped katharine in the silk folds of her parachute and emerges from the near the familiar cleft in the rock struggling with the exertion of the climb as
they approach the cave of swimmers
he has a large water bottle slung around his neck and a haversack and is loaded like a pack horse
katharine opens her eyes
whispering why did you hate me
dont you know you drove everybody mad
gasping you speak so many bloody languages and you never want to talk
they stagger on
he suddenly notices a stain of gold at her neck
its saffron leaking from a silver thimble which hangs from a black ribbon
overwhelmed youre wearing the thimble
i always wear it
ive always worn it
ive always loved you
almasy cries as he walks huge sobs no words convulsed with the pain of it
they approach the cave
almasy comes through in shadows carrying katharine blocking out the light that pours into the entrance of the cave
once inside he sets her down incredibly gently makes a bed of blankets and the parachute
he turns on his flashlight
its so cold
ill make a fire
ill be back
panicking suddenly dont leave me
im just going to find things for the fire
cave of swimmers
almasy returns with the stocks of acacia twigs the expedition had cached
as he makes the fire the light sends his shadow flitting across the walls
shall we be all right
with a laugh oh dear
as he works listen to me katharine
youve broken your ankle and im going to have to try and bind it
i think your wrist might be broken too and some ribs which is why its hurting you to breathe
im going to have to walk to el taj
given all the traffic in the desert these days i should bump into one army or another before i reach there or fenelon barnes and his camel
and then ill be back and well be fine and ill never leave you
the fire is lit and he comes over to her kneels beside her
do you promise
i wouldnt want to die here
i wouldnt want to die in the desert
ive always had a rather elaborate funeral in mind with particular hymns
and i know exactly where i want to be buried
in our garden
where i grew up
with a view of the sea
so promise me youll come back for you
i promise ill come back
i promise ill never leave you
and theres plenty of water and food
you can have a party
he kisses her tenderly
pulls out his herodotus and lays it beside her
then he puts down the flashlight
and a good read
of the flashlight battery dont waste it
clouds over will you bury geoffrey
i know hes dead
im sorry katharine
every night i cut out my heart but in the morning it was full again
hes tearing strips from the parachute with his knife
as he starts to bind her wrist he gets her to talk trying to distract her from the pain
tell me about your garden
tries to focus our garden our garden not so much the garden but the copse alongside it wild a secret way plunging down to the shore and then nothing but
water between you and france
the devils chimney it was called he pulls tight on the binding the devils chimney i dont know why
he kisses her darling
almasy burying clifton
hes dug a narrow trench and now he goes to the body
cliftons face is oil stained bloody
almasy takes his handkerchief and pouring his precious water into it cleans geoffreys seventy miles north north west
i had madoxs compass
a man can walk in the desert as fast as a camel
thats about two and a half miles an hour
he slides and collapses as he misjudges a dune gets up stumbles on
i stopped at noon and at twilight
three days there i told her then three hours back by jeep
dont go anywhere
ill be back
he trudges on his eyes opening and closing
hes singing to keep awake
darktown strutters ball
ill be down to get you in the taxi honey
he does a little shuffle
looks behind at the crazy trail of his footprints
a vast flat expanse of dried salt lake
a remorseless horizon
almasy walks checking the compass squinting at the sun
then he sees a cloud of dust traveling across the horizon
it comes closer moving at great speed reveals itself
almasy lowers himself by an old rope down into a gully
he approaches a pile of stones and removes them to reveal a brackish pool of filthy water
he drinks pouring water over his head grimacing at the taste but parched too
almasy gets his first sight of the fortress town of el taj and sinks to his knees in relief and exhaustion
then he gets up and trudges towards the town
a corporal with a rifle in his hands appears
the corporal brings almasy into a square
a young officer appears from the shadows of his office
his jeep is parked in the shade
could i trouble you for some water
registering the accented english yes of course
the corporal has a water bottle hands it to almasy so golly where have you come from
gulping the water i desperately need a jeep
theres been an accident
brain racing no im not thinking clearly i need a doctor too to come with me can i take this vehicle
ill pay of course and some morphine and
calculating seventy miles i can be back here by dusk
do you have your papers sir

i am a member of the royal geographical society

the officer is writing this down
a glance at his corporal
almasy would you mind just spelling that for me

i have been walking for three days
i dont want to spell my name i want you to give me this jeep
writing i understand you are agitated perhaps you would like to sit down while i radio back to hq snapping no
dont radio anybody just give me the fucking jeep
almasy sets on the officer hauling him by the lapels but them immediately loses his balance
as he stumbles up he gets the stock of the corporals rifle across his head knocking him to the ground
almasy head pounding is in the back of the jeep chained to the tailgate
the corporal is driving
shouting hoarse hey
stop this jeep
let me out of here theres a woman dying theres a woman dying while im hey

my wife is dying
listen fritz if i have to listen to another word from you ill give you a fucking good hiding
what are you talking about
thats your name innit
count fucking arsehole von bismarck
whats that supposed to be then irish
almasy berserk starts to yank at his chains screaming
let me out let me out let me out katharine
katharine has been writing in the herodotus
the torchlight flickers
she shakes the torch
it flickers again
then goes out
the sound of her trembling breath
a train scuttles through the desert
almasy is handcuffed to the metal grille of the goods compartment
hes lying down amongst a bunch of other prisoners and their little bundles of possessions in this makeshift cell some arabs some italians
a sergeant pushes a lavatory bound prisoner along the corridor leaving behind a young private who sits on a packing case with a rifle across his lap reading a penguin
edition of gullivers travels
almasy is in complete despair to be on the train
he tries to move but hes locked tight to the grille
he rattles the cuffs against the metal
the soldier looks up i also need to use the lavatory
youll have to wait
calls up the corridor sarge
jerry wants to use the lav says its urgent
where are we going please
to the coast
soon be there
get a boat home
youll be all right
almasy cant bear this news
the sergeant returns
go on then you take him
the soldier pushes almasy along the corridor
they arrive outside the lavatory
the soldier is distracted for a split second
enough for almasy to elbow him savagely in the stomach winding him then he kicks him repeatedly in the head
he wraps his cuffs around the soldiers neck and yanking them together and twisting produces a tiny efficient and sickening snap
he finds the key to the handcuffs unlocks them grabs the soldier and drags him into the empty lavatory
almasy arrives at the rear of the train passes the kitchen carriage where arabs sweat over the boiler
he pulls open the back door only to surprise a guard whos lolling casually enjoying the sunset
almasy shoots him with his stole rifle
he clambers over the guard rail and leaps off the train tumbling into the desert sunset
almasy silhouetted against the evening sky walks back down the track three hundred miles away from the dying katharine clifton no way now of saving her
he is a tiny speck in the vast desert
his heart broken
he sinks to his knees in despair
the patient is exhausted
he has said aloud what has tortured him
his failure to save katharine
he looks at caravaggio
she died because of me
because i loved her
because i had the wrong name
kip is working at a blacksmiths forge in the stables
he is heating pieces of metal
he has arranged his material on a bench a bayonet a rifle a piece of bomb casting
hana enters goes up hugs him from behind
what are you up to
that gun at lahor kiplings cannon zamzammah remember
that was made out of the metal of ordinary things
i want to make an ordinary thing out of guns
his bayonet is thrust into the forge
its red hot
when i went to england i was amazed at what went on the waste id been taught to re use everything the dung from a cow to cool a radiator
a fork to fix a typewriter india could live for a hundred years on what i saw thrown away
i should go to the house get breakfast
the lamp was burning all night in his room
caravaggio was there with him
she goes to kiss him
he is over the fire and protests
this is hot
teasing him nya nya nya
caravagio is injecting the patient with morphine
and did you never see katharine
you never got back to the cave
yes i got back there finally to keep my promise
to come back for her
and then of course i couldnt
i couldnt even do that properly
kip hammers the metal into its new shape
he stops distracted by something hes listening to on his crystal set
its new he seems not to fully understand about a bomb dropping on japan
a new kind of suddenly kip slops it into the trough of water sending a great hissing column of steam
caravaggio sits by the patient
you get to the morning and the poison leaks away doesnt it
black nights fucking black nights when you want to howl like a dog
i thought i would kill you
you killed my friends you ruined my hands
but the girl was always here like some guardian angel
you cant kill me
i died years ago
no now i cant kill you
kip storms into the room walks straight up to the patient and points a gun at him
caravaggio is taken by surprise
kip what are
stay out of this
i looked up to you uncle
my brother always said i was a fool
never trust the british he said the deal makers the map makers never shake hands with them
what are you talking about
what have i been doing all this time
do you know how many mines ive seen
more mines than there are soldiers more how many mines weve put in the ground ourselves stuffed in corpses dropped out of the sky
and now this
he approaches the bed
caravaggio tries to intervene
kip listen kip sings the rifle at him knocking him to the floor
i said keep out of this
he pulls of his earphones and rams them around the patients head dropping the set onto the bed
the patient listens coughing
can you hear
can you hear what theyre celebrating
i listened to you uncle
sitting at your feet always sitting at somebodys feet trying to learn
the right way to hold a teacup otherwise youre out the pukkah knot in your tie as if everything can be explained in terms of a cricket bat and an
its not even my name because you cant say it
kirpal singh bhuller is my name
hana runs in alerted by the commotion stunned by what she sees
well then ask him his name
getting in between kip and the patient whats happened
dont shoot please dont shoot anybody
theyre happy about destroying a whole city
would they do that to a white mans city
pulling off the earphones go on do it
i dont need to hear any more
kip listen he lost everything because he wasnt english jesus
shoot me im more english than he is
kip levels the gun at the patient
then breaks it open throws it down on the bed next to the earphones from which the news continues to leak some words audible eunola gay
and from different voices it was beautiful
the biggest bang you ever saw
kip is inside the tent the flap zipped
she sees his shadow move then freeze as she calls his name
its like a confessional
the flap between them the man in shadows hana crouched forlorn
no response why
its another bomb
however big whats the difference
thereve been so many bombs
what about coventry
what about dresden
where were those cities
no response i dont understand
let me come in
the shadow doesnt move
hana is at a loss
the patient becomes aware of something in the room opens his eyes squints into the darkness and sees a figure hovering against the wall
hes in the cave he thinks hes seeing the painted figures moving hes seeing the swimmer
kip bare chested no turban hair loose stands in the shadows at the foot of the patients bed
kip comes into the room
hana sits in the corner
she is nervous of him his look his intensity
will you come with me
i mean home
i interrupting this i know here i am always a brown man there you would be always a white woman
is that what you think
is that what you think i think
its what ive learned
im thinking about your heart not your skin
and how to reach it
and that i dont think i can
a bomb has ruined us just not the bomb i thought would ruin us
she stands goes to him
ive clung to you
ive clung to you
life a raft
clinging to her then come with me
next morning and kip has attached what he was making in the forge a new handle to the pump
now he works it producing a steady stream of water
his motorbike is against the wall
he goes to it
caravaggio is watching
he hugs kip wrapping his arms around the boy like a bear
hanas vegetable garden
hana stands by her vegetable garden
kip stops the motorbike
she goes to him stands fastens the top button of his coat
you feel she might jump on the seat behind him
but she doesnt
ill always go back to that church
look at my painting
ill always go back to that church
so one day well meet
he nods winds up the throttle and is gone
hana comes in carrying flowers and sets them down on the table next to a clutch of morphine ampoules
she picks up the hypodermic to prepare his injection
she takes a phial
the patient reaches out and pushes all of them
she looks at him
its a massive lethal dose
hana starts to prepare the injection her eyes filling with tears
the patient nods smiles whispers
she kisses him gently on the mouth
he closes his eyes
read to me will you
read me to sleep
the familiar cleft in the rocks
a plane is coming in to land
a flashlight flickers in the cave
katharines corpse lies where he left her a ghost on a bed of silk and blankets
the chill of the cave has preserved her
she could be asleep
she clutches the herodotus
katharine my darling
he sobs whispering to her
hes terribly cold exhausted
he slips underneath the covers to be next to her and closes his eyes
im so tired
the patient is slipping away
hana is reading from the last pages of the herodotus where katharine has written in the margins
my darling im waiting for you how long is a day in the dark or a week
the patient looks across and what he sees is katharine beside him in katharine is writing
the flashlight is faint
the fire is gone now and im horribly cold
i really ought to drag myself outside but then there would be the sun
she passes the flashlight across the wall the painted figures dancing in the pale light
im afraid i waste the light on the paintings and on writing these words
the bed is empty the mattress stripped
hana stands in the doorway then sees the herodotus on the bedside table
she picks it up goes to the page of katharines letter continues to read
we die we die rich with lovers and tribes tastes we have swallowed
caravaggio is at the gate to the monastery
the truck we saw before is waiting with him
the partisan with his head bandana and shotgun remains the same but now there are children in the back and a woman sits behind the man nursing a two year
he gets up into the balustrade tentatively finds his balance then starts to walk heel to toe slowly and then with more confidence along the long thin line of stone
the children watch intently
he turns and bows
bodies we have entered and swum up like rivers fears we have hidden in like this wretched cave
hana walks across the cloisters passing the chalked hopscotch squares leaving it all behind
then she stops bends retrieves a snail shell keeps going
katharines voice continues
almasy smudges katharines pale face with color
ochre across her brow blue on her eyelids red on her lips
he presses his cheek to hers smoothes her hair
i want all this marked on my body
we are the real countries not the boundaries drawn on maps with the names of powerful men
katharines voice continues
hana comes out to the truck carrying her small bundle
caravaggio effects some introduction beginning with the woman driver gioia
she and caravaggio smile like lovers
hana this is gioia
gioia smiles shakes her hand
then hana meets the others gioias brother and wife their children
she smiles at them
she can take you as far as florence
i can get in the back
and she clambers up sits down between the children
they exchange some small stiff shy smiles and then the truck bounces away
hana takes one final look at the monastery as it disappears around the bend and then turns and confronts the life insisting noisily in the truck
almasy comes out of the cave carrying the bundle of katharine in his arms wrapped in the silks of her parachute
i know you will come and carry me out into the palace of winds the rumors of water
thats all ive wanted to walk in such a place with you with friends on earth without maps
the plane growls and complains into the air
inside the cockpit the couple as at the front of the film
almasy obliterated by goggles and helmet
katharine behind him slumped forwards as if sleeping
almasy banks across the plateau of the gilf kebir and glances down
in a ravine is a sudden oasis of white acacias
he is mesmerized
and then its gone and he passes into the earth without maps the desert as it stretches out for mile after mile
the lamps gone out and im writing in the darkness
almasy the english patient begins to sing szerelem szerelem until that also fades and is replaced by the womans tender lament heard at the beginning of the film singing for
all that has been lost
the sound of gun fire
