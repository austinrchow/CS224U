written by nicholas jarecki over credits we hear but you took a huge bet on the housing crisis in the middle of the biggest boom anybodyd ever seen
im a child of the s
my father welded steel for the navy
and my mother worked at the va
as the conversation continues we see
a maid clean an expansive living room waxing a mahogany table
a butler open sliding doors to an empty grand sitting room
an overhead shot as a servant carries packages up a long winding staircase
they lived through the depression pearl harbor and the bomb
and they didnt think bad things might happen they knew they would happen
is that whats happening now
when i was a kid my favorite teacher was mr
james said that world events always revolve around five things extending his fingers one and right on cue we see for the first time robert miller sitting on a sofa
across from maria bartiromo and a camera crew mid interview
ellen miller watches on a nearby monitor
was this freshman econ
this was fifth grade econ
smiles off her laugh but this is something weve seen over and over again time and time again that competition for this limited amount of dollars out there can make
even the best of us manic
so its not surprising that we see these asset bubbles but when reality sets in of course they burst
and we push tighter into the plane cutting into the engine as we hear a sonic boom and focus inside revealing
a sleek slate gray cabin divided into three seating areas
at the back of the plane five aides de camp chatter in hushed tones pouring over a sea of red inked paper
in the galley gavin briar pours a coffee
he brings it who sits alone in his private area facing the cockpit scribbling his own red ink across a stack of contract documents
his effortless slouch silver hair and all commanding mannerisms make one thing clear roberts our man
handing him the coffee here you go
robert sips it
what was that about
it makes no sense
thats what you said last week
whyd we go down there
and did we sign
we did not
instead i fly two thousand miles for a marketing meeting
and where was mayfield
what was this emergency
what was that about
after a beat did you speak to the auditors
we dont dont close this week
we push into a close up of robert as he contemplates what this would mean
the roar of thirty million dollars landing near tall grass
robert walks down the passenger steps onto the tarmac followed by gavin and the aides
they approach a waiting mercedes maybach
the aides hand file boxes and briefcases to the hispanic driver ramon who loads them into the trunk
the blur of city lights as the limo passes over bridges and towards the city and park avenue and finally approaches an enormous turn of the last century stanford white
designed red brick mansion two already giant townhouses combined
robert and gavin exit the limo and head inside
its our first glimpse of roberts home and it doesnt disappoint
its an s tudor given a full once over maintaining period details but updated with a modernist flair
it actually works
a servant takes roberts briefcase from him as he enters handing him three small presents which he puts under his arm
we hear sounds of a dinner party complete with children laughing
hold on roberts face some mixture of excitement and anticipation
a party in progress dinner already served
seated around a large square table are ellen roberts wife brooke roberts daughter peter roberts son tom brookes boyfriend anne peters wife and ellens playing with one of the kids
she sees robert
look your grandfathers here
the kids clamor for roberts attention
he moves around the table hugging them all
what did you bring us
robert hands out the presents and the kids unwrap them in a frenzy
he continues making the rounds until he finally gets to brooke and peter seated next to each other
they embrace but we notice clear restraint a marked contrast to his behavior towards their kids
its your birthday dad not theirs
youre spoiling them rotten
its my job
its my job
you guys turned out fine
to peter as they hug and how you doin son
robert rounds the table and takes his seat next to ellen as she discreetly waves to the servants
we had to eat
the kids were starving
hugging her happy no no thats okay
wheres my drink is this mine here
another servant enters with a cake flickering birthday candles
everyone notices and starts clapping
they finish cheering then clink glasses for a toast
thank you thank you thank you all very much its such a surprise i didnt even know it was my birthday
everyone laughs a little
what did mark twain say about
he said old age
is clearly a case of mind over matter
if you dont mind it doesnt matter
ive done a lot of things in my life worked very hard but being here looking around at all these shining radiant faces i know that my best work is
right here in this room right now
im deeply proud of all of you
thats the best gift your mother and i could have hoped for so thank you
and to have sold the company to standard this morning
they all laugh
that too peter but no business tonight no business
oh here we go
more group laughter
although your one track mind assures me youve got not only your mothers genes but youve got mine too
robert laughs too
he sees ellen hug peter across the room
now im aware that may seem uncharacteristic but maybe its taken me sixty years to realize whats truly important and its you guys so thank you all very much
as they applaud hear hear
a warm clubby room kept traditional
robert pours out two kids are wild
i dont know about me as a mom
no no no you should have i want more yous around
robert brings the drinks to the banquette where brooke rests with an open folder
he resumes signing papers
its all about you isnt it
yeah yeah yeah
brooke nods tries to smile
so what was that all about
the last time you made a speech like that we lost the firestone bid
wanted it to be about the family tonight
she nods again unconvinced then pulls out a magazine
you see this
he looks closely at it
a forbes cover story robert miller the oracle of gracie square investor profits in uncertain times by predicting housing crisis
shakes his head yeah
you know how i feel about that
peters got a copy pinned up in the conference room
sits back takes a drink well you gonna keep skirting around it
brooke leans back and stares at him
why sell our company
we make a great return we give money to the causes we believe in
my darling you are still in your s
thats a big difference in point of view
dad youre not that old
it catches up alright
and maybe theres some other things id like to do
maybe i would like to spend a little more time with you guys
outside the office
brooke shoots him a look
staring at him then im just trying to imagine what we would do
ellen is supervising the yawning children as the party winds down
she sees robert put on his overcoat
where are you going
yeah i gotta finish up that thing
she holds a beat then approaches and straightens his collar
but i havent given you your birthday present yet
ill be back as soon as i can
he kisses her and starts to exit
she stares as he walks out
hold on her
a taxi stops in front of a large frosted glass apartment entrance
robert exits paying the driver through the window
into his phone yeah gavin its me uhh
when you get this i want you to call chris vogler at fremaut tell him i need to see him right away okay
julie cote sits at the head of a marble table in the exquisite space
its the modern mirror of roberts mansion the lines carried through fully this time
and julie is the modern woman sleek fit and flowing even at home
shes intently focused handwriting personal notes onto a stack of invitations for the julie cote gallery paintings by victor rodriguez april th as she downs the last of a white
shes got a seating chart out that shes working on
the intercom rings
julie heads over sees roberts face on the video monitor
she holds a beat
robert waits in the cold staring into the camera as julie watches him from inside the loft not moving
after a second the door buzzes open
julie is already back at the table writing
shes arranging polaroids of different paintings on a wall along with a seating chart
he walks down the long hall
he comes up behind her running his arms across her stomach
standing in frustration okay
she crosses to the open kitchen and pours out more wine lights a cigarette
alright im sorry
im sorry im late
im always late you know that and im sorry
and im always saying im sorry about being late
crosses to her it doesnt mean i wouldnt rather be here with you
they stare at each other as she drags off the cigarette then stubs it out
he gestures to the dining table
the shows gonna be beautiful
you gonna be there
slight beat then i will be there
she stares still in the moment
then she heads to the fridge and slides out a homemade birthday cake
he stares at it
oh wow thats great
i made this for you
you made this
this is amazing
one candle thank you very
she reaches for the cake grabbing a piece of it with her hand and
smears it onto his face
the tension breaks and they laugh
he grabs her and they kiss furiously pulling at each others clothes as she pushes him backwards into the bedroom and they begin to make love
robert enters the palatial quarters decorated with ornate th century furniture
as well see soon its a stark contrast to his functional empire
he follows a striking british receptionist down a long hallway passing a massive glass conference room
they arrive at the receptionist escorts robert in
standing to greet him is jeffrey greenberg handsome and charming
thank you diane
a moment of silence
guess whats not
jeffrey i told you im
working on it yeah
well while youre doing that lemme tell you whats not working
whats not working is my four hundred twelve million dollars thats sitting in your account so you can pass your audit the four hundred twelve million that you needed you
said for two weeks and which has been languishing now for looks down at paper thirty two days while it could be elsewhere invested earning an actual return instead of couching the absurd lie that youre spinning
what do you want me to say
that youre gonna get a signature from mayfield and that my hostage money and my fee are going to be sent to me promptly say
i am solving the problem
i am getting you your money and your fee
you will have them very shortly
as soon as they sign the contract
you know im not the one with the liability pal
i just made a loan
youre looking at jail for a thousand years for fraudulent conveyance and
you dont have to talk to me like that
i didnt get you into this mess
you were a friend of mine
remember when you asked me if it was a good idea to divert half your liquid assets into a fucking copper mine
what did i tell you
stands heading to door are we done here
i think were done here
jeffrey stares at him contemplatively for a moment then appears to reach some sort of conclusion
friday morning i take my money back
you cant do that
the fuck i cant its in an escrow bill with one day call rights
i need the money there until they sign jeffrey
what if they check again
thats really not my problem is it
stares fumes not your fuckin problem
off robert as he storms the pavement
and enters his waiting limousine slamming the door
they drive off
robert turns on the television
the dow continues its uptick this morning on new housing starts to rise points
asian markets fared less well especially in russia where further nationalization plans caused foreign investment to sputter leading to various
close on robert trying hard to contain his building rage
his phone vibrates a text from julie see you at
he stares at it breathes in deeply
the carphone rings gavin
seven thirty tonight at the four seasons
well get it straight with mayfield then
calming a little good
ellen stands tying roberts tie in front of a dressing mirror
is this too blue
its the third one youve tried
she finishes tying it
he looks in the mirror
ay yay yay
i look old
you look regal and wise and granted a little worried
what is going on
are you afraid of this meeting
they havent signed the papers
i thought thats why you flew down there
rubbing his eyes so did i but for some reason theyre stalling
i didnt get any sleep on the plane and
now come on
it will all work out
just follow the plan
what plan is that
confidence equals contract
you sound like a fortune cookie
theyre your words actually
then you married an idiot
okay but i was thinking idiot that after the deal is done which it definitely will be why dont we just take off
petes in the best place hes ever been your daughter is always as brilliant right
so i wanna have some fun
i wanna have fun with you
he stares at her softly but stays silent
lets go to ravello the house there
we havent been there forever
there hasnt been time
we have to make time
we go for a year
lets take a year and get fat and have fun and go on an adventure
i mean seriously how much money do we need
do you wanna be the richest guy in the cemetery
he straightens his jacket laughs
i dont wanna be in the cemetery
oh by the way mary called from st
victors hospital again she said they still havent gotten the check yet

the gala is friday

whats going on
ive had to move some things around for the merger
its only two million
walks up to her laughs only two million
you remember riccios
all you can eat
i do remember
but i do not remember you being so sentimental unless you were trying to change the subject
a knock at the door
as he heads out smiling i dont know what youre talking about
ellen slaps his behind
robert and gavin ride both shuffling papers
robert trails gavin up the stairs as he types out a text message to julie wrapping up mtg be there soon
the maitred spots robert and greets him as he approaches
miller good to see you sir
your party has already arrived
he leads robert and gavin into the where we see brooke and peter seated with a group of executives including aimes and barnes
displeasure immediately registers on roberts face
sotto to gavin where the hell is mayfield
gavin shakes his head
they approach the table
as they sit mr
miller thank you for coming
we were just getting acquainted with brooke and peter here
i hope they didnt beat you up too much
theyve been terrific
dad weve been talking about operations
tim thinks once we consolidate we can save about fifty percent on our back office
robert phone vibrates
its julie calling
he silences it
id love to hear about that but
i had thought mr
mayfield planned to join us tonight
jim should be here in twenty minutes he suggested we get right into details
i was just telling brooke now that we can market your quants track records we have access to a host of new capital that
robert drifts as the suits prattle on
the execs are still chattering
robert is sweating
julie calls again
robert silences it again
then he gets a text pm fuck you
assuming we shed debt through some small liquidations id say
im sorry gentlemen weve been here nearly two hours now
where is mr
he just texted me
hes very sorry but hes been detained
alright i think i can leave you with my family
miller a privilege
yeah yeah yeah
robert refuses aimes hand and heads out
they move off to the side
this is the bullshit way you try to close a deal
would you like to have some port
as brooke catches up with her father in the hallway
did you get my message
we need to sit down
what is it
i dont want to talk about it here
i found some strange entries in the old hill books
what kind of entries
im not sure yet but theres definitely something off
alright come by about eleven tomorrow and well look at it then
see if you can find out what happened to mayfield
she nods as robert dashes down the hall
robert exits his maybach in front of a big scene in progress trendy folks overflowing into the street cameras flashing
the space is cavernous modern luxe a liagre design with thirty foot columns and slab granite
the art collection on display is indeed beautiful photo realist paintings and each one tells a strange story
robert enters and scans the room
he approaches the gallery assistant
howre they doing
everyone loves them
yeah but how are they doing
he scans the party further
shes in the back
we pick up on julie bumping two rails of cocaine
shes dressed in a burnt red form fitting lanvin dress hair coiffed perfectly made up if we didnt suspect anything wed think she was the precise image of new york
art world success
julie pulls her hair back and straightens enters the main gallery
where she quickly sees robert searching for her through the crowd
she stops dead considers going back into the office
but she stands firm
robert finds her eyes
he stares at her
she stares back with a simple look that says plainly go away
she turns and heads off to talk to a group of patrons including the painter victor
one of the group is a dashing young man is he flirting with her
robert approaches staring at the young man then at julie
shes all smiles but she doesnt immediately introduce him
he stands there until hey julie
to the group this is robert miller one of our collectors
this katrina stanton and alex stanton and their daughter ava who is a talented young artist
robert shakes hands with the group exchanging pleasantries especially kind to young ava
julie begins to walk off disappearing into the crowd
yeah thats great
as he notices julie leave to the group goldenrod
i like the size of the paintings i wanna talk to you about them in a second
robert trails julie moving up to her quickly
he reaches out to touch her and she spins towards him violent definitive
why are you doing this
julie heads back to the buyers
dismayed robert takes a last glance then recedes out towards the entry desk
he approaches the gallery assistant he was talking to earlier and picks up the buy sheet at the desk marking some pieces
i will take those two
and the rubiks cube on the back wall
pointing to list right there number seven
dont tell her it was me
off her nod i mean it
you got it
robert walks out and hails his driver
off robert in bed with ellen who is asleep
he gets up and stumbles to the bathroom puts on a robe
he approaches the basement level carrying a folder of papers
and sits at the counter staring at a report of some kind
he refills a glass of scotch downs it
julies a touch worn from the evening but shes still composed
she sits with five guests including her gallery assistant the handsome young man from earlier two women and two guys who look like painters
one does a line of cocaine off a fantom magazine
fucking dalwood wouldnt know a van gogh from a van eyck
and they call it a state of contemporism
julies phone rings
she looks at the caller id which shows her home line calling confused
what do you want
robert watches julie through a crack in the doorway
hes on her cordless phone
im in your bedroom
can you get those people out of here
are you serious
look down the hall
do you see me
i see you
okay so im serious
she hangs up and begins to clear out the guests
robert sits unbuttoning his collar
the guests finally leave
julie heads to the bedroom
and finds robert sitting looking a little too comfortable
you just come in and out whenever you want
i thought we should talk
laughs then in a rage one damn night in a month i told you was important to me et tu es meme pas capable detre la
i was working do you understand
im under enormous pressure i have obligations
i dont want to hear about your obligations
if you cared you i was there
i was there
i was late but i was there
and im here now
no no no
youre here when its convenient for you to be here
cest pas ca lamour
love means goldenrod
she walks off into the robert follows her
they stand at a great distance as she downs a red wine
why did you buy those paintings
because i liked them
her face falls slightly but she keeps her grace and her anger
okay thank you for helping me get started
but if im gonna fail then let me fail
julie youre not gonna fail
why would you fail
he crosses towards her
you know im not the kinda guy who wants to throw money away but if you wanna start a business you have to project a certain image
he sits down next to her
the markets a disaster right now nobodys moving anything
thats why you gotta show sales
people look at you then and they say whoah howd she do that
and thats what they remember
she stares at him laughs a little in devastation then
youre never gonna leave her
hold on roberts face as he stares at her silently
julie is on the bed holding herself crying
robert comes up next to her hugs her
come away with me
lets just take your car and go
theres a place upstate
very beautiful on the water
we can wake up there together just you and me
id like that
shes keeps crying but
a mercedes sel driving the interstate towards connecticut
billie holiday sings her just one more chance
we hold on a two shot through the windshield julie rests her head on roberts shoulder
and the camera moves closer into roberts face julie snuggled next to him billies music lulling the moment into tranquility and finally just finally robert has a moments respite as
he slowly closes his heavy eyelids nodding off into a trance of desperately needed sleep until
a scraping metallic noise jolts us back to reality as the car drifts into the center median where the tire catches on a small metal scrap and blows out flipping
the car over and over until it careens to a halt
roberts eyes flutter open as he comes to groggy
hes badly injured but breathing
he starts to feel his body
he looks over at julie
it is instantly obvious she is dead shes been nearly decapitated a deep gash ripping through her neck
shock followed quickly by panic
we hear a dripping sound
a gas leak
robert reaches into his pocket and dials
he looks at the phone just before pressing send
and hangs up
he tries to open the door
he kicks at it
he drags himself out of the car
smoke is still rising from the smashed hood
he pulls up his shirt
a deep bruise a broken rib from the steering column
he takes a few steps forward moving around to the passenger side
he looks again at julie
he reaches out to touch her then stops
hold on his face
he sinks to his knees putting his head in his bloody hands
then he rises and begins hiking to the side of the road
robert walks and walks through tall grass
in the distance behind him a massive explosion lights up the sky in a fireball as the gas tank finally catches incinerating the car and its contents
robert cleans himself up in the sink applying soap and water to his cut stomach scrubbing frantically he takes all the paper towels and puts them in his pocket
robert picks up a payphone by the bathrooms cradling it to his ear with his sleeve and dialing with his other finger through his shirt fiber
yes i wanna make it collect
your name sir
who the fuck is this
jimmy its me
i want you to listen to me very closely
police cars flash lights
an emt unloads julies charred corpse into a body bag
investigators sift through rubble
michael bryer sits in a tan sedan drinking a cup of deli coffee
barely awake he stares out the window at a bunch of state troopers arguing with his partner mills
mills breaks away from the uniforms and approaches shaking his head
bryer gets out of the car
you gotta be fucking kidding me
catching detective wants us to rule before he calls it
weve been having the same fuckin argument for twenty years
they cant handle one drunk motorist kills herself
im not so sure about this
bryer heads over to the car his interest piqued
mills shines his flashlight towards the passenger side
car roll had multiple impacts but she was here and her feet were down there
bryer immediately sees what he means dented metal even in the burnt door
so who kicked out the door
bryer bends his head down to the cars passenger side looking off into the distance of the path robert took just moments before
about twenty yards down the road a black suv hums waiting
robert opens the passenger door and gets in
inside is jimmy grant black
they start to drive
jimmy looks over at robert hes pretty banged up
you gonna tell me what this is
its better you dont ask
so all youre sayin is you need a ride somewhere
because i want to be very clear about this you called me to give you a ride
im giving you a ride
no youre not

which is where you left your phone right
because if anyone checks

jimmy exhales a long sigh

what do you want you want money
i will give you five thousand dollars
i will give you ten thousand dollars

jimmy swerves the car to the side of the road and stops
you wanna talk to me like that you can get the fuck outta my car and you can walk
you want that
you wanna fuckin walk home
after a beat listen
im not myself
i need your help
jimmy waits a moment then re enters the road
robert winces in pain
robert is holding his side
he pulls up his shirt
jimmy sees the awful purple bruise from the steering column
we gotta get you to a hospital
no i just
have to get home
ill deal with it in a couple of hours
what if you dont make it a couple of hours
then i dont make it
the suv stops a few blocks from roberts house
through the window call me alright and let me know its okay
as he exits better we dont talk for a while
cant believe it through the window so what you get in a bind and just call up the only nigger you know
robert looks at jimmy eyes tearing
im sorry jimmy
i really am
just go home
yeah alright man
take care of that
jimmys car drives off
robert hobbles up the block
robert enters the basement
he runs into a security monitoring room
we see a street view of cameras outside the door he just entered
he pulls discs out of video recorders
robert stands in front of a bin marked incinerator
he is wearing a new t shirt and slacks
he places all of his bloodied clothes and the video discs into the incinerator pouring lighter fluid on top of them
staring at the clothes he notices one cuff link is missing
he strikes a match setting the items on fire and closes the hopper
as he exits the burning area everything okay sir
robert turns startled
im fine glen
go back to bed
the servant shuffles off
robert quietly undresses leaving on the white undershirt
he presses at his rib winces again
then he gets into bed and stares at the ceiling
where did you go
i woke up for a minute you werent here
i just went to
eat some ice cream
was it good
pained shifting his body yes
dont forget to take your lipitor in the morning
do you still love me
of course i do
she rolls over
hold on roberts face
syd felder sits next to robert
hypothetically the situation youre describing would be involuntary manslaughter
and such a person
would be in a lot of trouble especially if that person was closing a merger with a large public bank where any publicity or arrest could delay or derail the
but thats only if there was some evidence that could link him to the crime
very hard to collect after an explosion
the real worlds different from television
what about cell phone records
did this person make any calls from the area
not from a cell phone no
then they wont be able to place him there
what would you advise such a person to do
to confess immediately
to put as much distance between himself and the event as possible if possible
but let me tell you something and im speaking to you as a friend now there are about fifty things that person wouldnt have thought of
and the more time that passes the more lies that are told the worse it gets for him
theyre going to come to you
an accidents not the worst trouble
if we talk to them now we can probably work it out
you tell me what happens if the standard deal does not close and i gotta tell my investors about our real losses
and whatd you say about the justice department
depending on what they decide to arrest me on fraud conviction gets me twenty years
laughs in pain what choice do i really have
we follow chris vogler through the busy lobby out to the street
he crosses park avenue and gets into roberts limo
robert opens the percocet bottle downs four pills
chris enters and sits
robert mimes a question
youre aware congress plans to extend the audit requirements for private funds
of course i am aware
i gave testimony to the committee
you know this
well standard wants to prepare for it now
so i was asked to go through every one of your trading books and reconfirm their assets
i put the team on different books and i left old hill for myself
anyway im here to tell you i cleared it
the audits cleared
the report will be issued today
actually im calling it my swan song
yeah on friday its a five year clock
to prevent exactly what were doing
but honestly theres nothing left to worry about
the carphone rings
how was it
what the fuck are you talking about
the show julies show
oh it was fine
a beat as robert rubs his eyes
checked in about an hour ago
no brooke has a friend on the executive committee who said hes taking meetings in his room
maybe hes settling in
you think were dealing with a fucking idiot
i spoke to legal
they said standard will sign once they get the audit report
thats being issued now
how do you know that
never mind that just find out why mayfield hasnt called us
how am i
do i have to do every goddamn thing myself
just find out
will you he hangs up and exhales deeply
we track through a spartanly furnished trading office high design with lacquer and muted mahogany
people at computers make phone calls
clocks show different time zones
brooke sits across from robert
theyre reviewing papers
i cannot reconcile it
the old hill fund
dad are you listening to me
of course im listening
okay those trades are in the special book
they dont get audited on the same balance sheet
yeah but look at the sheet
it cant be right
theres a four hundred million dollar hole here
i mean that cant be right
bryer enters the glass doors and badges the may i help you
i was hoping to see mr
is he expecting you
the way that this sheet reads half of the funds assets are missing
that cant be right
i know its ridiculous and yet
okay ill look into it
i promise you ill look into it
the intercom handset rings
theres a detective bryer here to see you
stiffens then into phone give me two minutes then send him in
yes my other meeting just got here early
well have to pick this up later
and mom wants to know about the hospital check
brooke well pick it up later alright
robert steels himself
detective bryer hi im cindy mr
millers personal assistant right this way
as brooke exits she and bryer cross paths
she eyes him
he doesnt look familiar
off brooke curious
robert leads bryer towards two sofas where they sit opposite each other
yeah im sorry to keep you waiting
you can sit there
we just heard about it
okay so you were an investor in her gallery
howd you meet her
i think it was a charity function
my wife and i have a foundation
whend you last see her
last night at the gallery
did you stay till the doors closed
no i think i left about ten
whered you go
you go straight home
you stay home
your wife home
bryer shifts edging forward
okay so now back to the gallery
did you see her with anyone
see her with anyone what do you mean
you know like a boyfriend someone she mightve left with
not that i noticed
reason i ask is that we havent located the driver
yeah someone else was driving
sometimes the driver will go for help and hell die tryin you know
this is awful
this is truly awful
were searching the area right now
so no boyfriend that you know of
actually we didnt talk about personal matters
she was just an employee right
well not an employee
i was an investor
whyd you invest
why did i invest
yeah whyd you invest
she had a great eye
she found me those bryce mardens there
they went up in value very quickly and on the basis of that i agreed to fund some of the gallery
after a beat would you mind if we searched her apartment
why would i mind
its in your companys name
sure go ahead
why would you lease an apartment for ms
is that something you normally do for your employees
actually i said that she wasnt an employee but i think shed just come over from paris if i remember and she needed a place to entertain buyers
so you leased her this apartment
it was through our holding company
you seem a little confused by all this
but ill get there
now i dont mean to be indelicate
but youre going to be indelicate
well from what ive been able to gather she wasnt exactly an art star
i mean she worked for a couple a dealers in paris but
oh okay i get it so why would i invest in her and help her find a place
something like that yeah
its very simple detective
i invest in people i believe in
i thought shed do well so i backed her she did
its is simple as that

so were all good with the apartment then
robert shows him to the door
bryer turns back

does it hurt you
touching the cut oh no i just hit it on the medicine cabinet
hate when that happens
well thanks for the chat
bryer heads out
we hold on robert as he closes the door and winces in pain
a serene khaki suite with high post windows and white upholstered furniture
on the walls are gala posters from various charity events
mae s sits at a reception desk typing
the phone rings
ellen millers office
ellens standing cradling the phone and packing her handbag
across her desk susan s reviews the guest list for the hospital event
and it it transformed them seriously
theres a detective bryer in the lobby
ellen holds up her hand buying a moment
and thanks again for your generosity

ellen smooths her suit and puts her bag over her shoulder
heading to the door well im late so i just cant deal with it right now

ellen exits the building passes the doorman and then bryer who is waiting in his car outside the multi unit townhouse where she keeps her office
she doesnt notice him as she passes and enters a towncar
shes about half way into the car when he approaches
calling after her mrs
shows his badge detective bryer
did you just call my office
yeah i was hoping to talk to you
well i dont have time right now sorry
turning on the charm just take a couple a seconds
its about your husband
well fine but make an appointment
she closes the door and rides away
bryer smiles in frustration walks back to his car
off ellens face as she tries to keep it together shaking
a forensics team sweeps the apartment collecting fingerprints rug samples etc
mills supervises from the side
howd it go
well the wife blew me off which was interesting
and he didnt admit to the affair but then he wouldnt would he
why didnt you pick him up
hes a very rich man
what happened with the pay phones
mills pulls out a sheet from verizon
got about fifteen calls in a three mile
two of em look a little strange got an incoming thats probably a local drug deal
and the one we care about
about a minute and a half
made from the chevron station on west lake road
whod he call
cellphone in harlem
still waiting on the address
thinks gets up and so youre at the crash site
you make it outta the car
youre smart enough not to use your own cellphone
so you get to the pay phone
and youre a billionaire right
youre a billionaire so whaddya do
mills shrugs for the you call someone in harlem
robert is heading down the hall towards the elevators
gavin jogs up to him
out of breath robert i just heard about julie

her moms flying in today
managing a nod her mom

well we should pick up the expenses for that
whatever she wants
youll take care of that personally for me

the elevator arrives and robert gets in
not yet but well get him

gavins still staring as the doors close
pedestrians hurry by this busy stretch of upper manhattan
bryer and mills wait
lets flash him
they drive up on the sidewalk blocking jimmys path and mills exits the car
nypd homicide would you mind stepping into the car
whats this about
through the window just get in the car jimmy

jimmy sits across the table from mills and bryer
they show him photos of julies burned body at the crash site
so lets do this again
man for what
my answers aint gonna change
you were asleep
and your phone rings
and its a wrong number
jimmy doesnt answer
why do you accept the charges on a collect call from a wrong number
i dont think i wanna answer any more questions
and you stay on the phone a minute and a half on a wrong number
what the fuck do you talk about area codes
i want to talk to my lawyer

robert signs the document closing the folder
youre gonna sign him out
i called in earl monroe
the basketball player
civil rights attorney
you remember crown heights
hes the best
hes the best above th street and that doesnt make him any cheaper
robert slumps back staring out the window
youve gotta get jimmy out of this
it might not be that easy
if he doesnt cooperate theyre likely to indict him on obstruction
what would he be looking at
hard to say
with his prior
five years maybe ten
jimmy stands at the counter as earl monroe s black signs papers
this is not going to go away
jimmy ignores him and exits with earl
jimmy and earl exit the buidling
ill call you tomorrow if theres any news
dont worry about anything
and dont talk to anyone else
you take care
jimmy nods and walks up the street towards syds limo in the distance
come on get in
the limo drives off
all you said was you wanted a fucking ride
you didnt tell me you killed that girl
im trying to put my life back together
okay i appreciate you helped us but now youre pushing it too far

your under suspicion
motherfucker im black
i am aware of that
and what exactly would you like me to do about it
buzzing the driver gentlemen my driver will take you where you wanna go but i cannot be a party to this conversation so this is where i get out
syd steps out of the limo and watches as it rolls away up tenth avenue
why couldnt you have just stayed
because i have responsibilities
and if i stayed there a lot of people wouldve been hurt
somebody was hurt
other people jimmy
ive got business troubles you understand

jimmy chews on this dissatisfied

jimmy laughs then rises and knocks on the limos partition
to the driver yo yo man pull over
stares at him what are you gonna do
i look like a fucking snitch to you
i dont know jimmy
i dont know
jimmy laughs in disgust begins to open the door
wait wait wait

jimmy grabs the document and gets out
robert stares ahead into space
his cellphone rings
ive got chris vogler from fremaut accounting you asked me to interrupt you
yeah put him through
he hears chris come on chris
robert ive run into some problems
were doing a non recommend
they got compliance involved
ive gotta go
brooke sits alone in the accountants office we saw earlier
she reviews spreadsheets on his computer and compares them with printouts from a file cabinet that she has broken open
numbers from the screen reflect across her reading glasses as she stares in disbelief
she dials a number
im looking at some statements right now
how much did you book last quarter
no im not
no peter im really just asking you
shes looking at an entry on the screen miller capital management peter miller group
mm thirty five million
for your entire group right
it wasnt sixty eight
of course its a big number
no im not
oh peter ill talk to you later
brooke taps the keyboard and a printer spits out pages
suddenly ben s an accountant we saw earlier appears
what are you doing in my office
brooke bolts up startled
she collects the papers she printed
holding up pages can you explain these
all the numbers youve falsified
you dont know what youre saying
brooke nods heads to the door
ben put his arm on her shoulder to stop her
get out of my way
youre hurting my arm
cant you just leave it alone
she stares at him
he drops his arm
she exits and turns
youre fired ben
you cant fire me
i just did
who do you think asked me to make those changes
she stares then approaches him
you tell me
bryer and mills sit with flores as he stares at a sheet
he was doing a little dealing a while back but it looks like he stopped
nah theyre all dead
so hes a good student magnet school whatever
then his mom dies and he gets popped for gun possession
even so how come he got probation
well he had an excellent lawyer
how the fuck does this kid afford felder and chausse
mills drops another folder on the table
we pulled his parents tax returns
guess where his father worked for twenty years
he was the fucking driver
wow this guys good
he puts down the sheet and leans back
where are you at with the kid
so far he wont budge
well hes a convicted felon
go get a warrant put him in front of a grand jury
lets see how long he holds out when he realizes hes looking at ten years off the prior
robert storms the hallway passing a waiting secretary
im sorry mr
miller as i explained from downstairs hes on a call right now and he said
he brushes past her
robert enters locking the door behind him
chris bolts up
what the fuck
tell me what is going on
robert comes closer
chris is freaking out
tell me whats going on
robert grabs chris by the collar
its not me
what do you mean its not
slackening his grip the audit passed
what do you mean the audit passed
it passed a week ago
like i said
we confirmed the money its all straight and done
why did you tell me that it didnt
because they asked me to hold it
thrashes him again who is they
and starts laughing
chris looks at him strangely as he walks out
he wants a better price
robert exits the building with what looks to be for the first time in the film a real smile
he walks towards his limo dials his cell
yes james mayfield please
as he enters his car mr
i think its time we had a talk
bryer walks with deferlito who rifles through a folder
cause its not gonna hold
the warrant doesnt need to hold
it just needs to scare him into giving up miller
what is it mike youre stalled out mid career so youre reaching for a high note
who gives a fuck
this is about judge rittenband isnt it
its cause hes running again
you wanna cost the judge his seat on a profiling claim
against earl monroe
im getting a piece of new evidence thatll seal it a hundred percent
good then come back when you got it
ill have it before you go in the jury room
we like this kid
i dont wanna lose him
think about it if we flip him you get robert miller
whats that worth to rittenband and to you for that matter
twenty years ray
twenty fucking years we watch these guys they out lawyer us they out buy us
im fucking sick of it
wheres the consequence
the guy did it
he does not get to walk just cause hes on cnbc
deferlito stops stares then signs the arrest warrant
you better not fuck me
he walks off
bryer holds a beat then pulls out his cell
i need a serious fuckin favor
robert enters moving much slower
as he approaches cindy he sees a worried look on her face
brookes waiting for you
did we have a meeting
no but she looked upset
brookes at the window in a chair
its clear that she has been crying
sweetie you okay
brooke holds out her hands
she has two copies of the old hill fund balance sheets
robert stands there a moment staring at her
we see brooke and robert from overhead like little dots as they cross th avenue towards central park
they walk solemnly towards a park bench in front of a lake
robert sits motions to brooke
you wanna sit
as he sits didnt you think id find out
then why didnt you tell me
because i hoped you wouldnt
oh come on
you tell me the truth now or i am done
i made a bad bet
no you committed fraud
thats a dangerous word brooke
what would you prefer
that you cheated
that you stole money from people who trusted you
that you lied
that you lied right to my face
because we were going broke
everything was finished
wed have nothing
how does that happen
you remember alexanderov
well he came to see me one day last year
he said robert weve got a great opportunity theres a copper mine its in russia its under exploited theres billions under the ground and to get it out all we
need is a couple hundred million you put in a hundred well put in a hundred well triple it all in six months
so i go check it out
and the geological surveys right friendly government
and to lock it in you hedge it right
sell the copper ahead on the commodities exchange and it all works its fine and youre making a fortune
beat then real fast goldenrod
but then theres something i hadnt accounted for variation margin and that friendly russian government all of a sudden not so friendly anymore and theyre blocking the export of the
copper so i gotta make it up i gotta put the cash in to cover the hedge
but im not worried about it because its still springing money theres so much money coming out of the ground you cant believe
you cant stop it
and yes im the oracle ive done housing ive arbd credit swaps i have done it all and yes again i know its outside the charter but it is fucking
until its not
the moneys trapped
you cant get it out
probably never will
its like a plane crash
it just happens
well it does not just happen
not just happen honey you are so naive sometimes
and like every father i pray that it doesnt happen to you which thanks to me it probably wont happen to you
thanks to you we may all be arrested
nobodys getting arrested
thats why i borrowed the money from jeffrey
plug the hole i put it there for a month they see the books are fine i transfer the company i pay back jeffrey with interest
make all of our investors whole and whats left we keep
at least we get to keep the house
if the company sells
if i lie for you
you dont have to lie
you didnt know about it
im the chief investment officer of this company
what do you think theyll say at the depositions
she didnt know
theyll take away my brokerage license failure to supervise you my name in every paper and blog while i visit your ass in jail
what did you want me to do
did you want me to let our investors go bankrupt
is that what you wanted
for people to get really hurt
gives you the audacity to think you can make those decisions
because its my job
no its illegal
and i am your partner
you are not my partner
you work for me
off her bewildered stare thats right
you work for me
everybody works for me
they pass a moment in silence
he looks at her destroyed expression
just just come here
just for a second and sit down
theres something i wanna tell you
and whatever you decide i wont blame you
she turns to look at him im on my own path
its up to you to move with it or against it
but im the patriarch thats my role
and i have to play it
stares a while then for a moment i thought you were gonna say you were sorry
she walks off
hold on robert alone in the park
jimmy approaches the building
bryer exits his sedan and walks over to him
oh man what
jimmy take a ride with me
back to the station
no man just get in the car
what if i say no
im not threatening you
im just asking you take a ride with me
jimmy considers gets into bryers car
they drive a while in silence
alright man what
look its pretty fuckin simple
i know you went to pick him up
this is what you wanna talk about
i told you i aint makin no more statements
and i know why
take a look at this
hands him a case folder ive got his phone calls i got his text messages
ive got the relationship with the girl
and they were fucking by the way
and then ive got you
ive got the time log from the pay phone
ive a got a fucking tollbooth photograph of you driving your car through the triborough
jimmy thumbs through the folder
theres no tollbooth photo
where you got that
thats bullshit cause i didnt do it
you lied to me
you lied to the police
you obstructed justice
talk to earl detective
you see this
holds up the grand jury this means that tomorrow grand jury hears your case in court
and tomorrow in court im gonna ask for a felony obstruction indictment and with with your prior you are going to prison for fifteen fucking years
you might get out in ten
youll be what then
thirty three with no job no girl no life
bryer pulls the car over
look i know you think millers your friend
i know about your father
beat then hard you dont know a goddamn thing about my father
i know miller paid his bills while he was dying
i know he got syd felder to get you out of trouble on your gun charge
that doesnt add up to this
okay hes driving he crashes he runs away who does he call
why do you think that is
cause youre disposable youre the one person he could call that just doesnt fuckin matter
youre a youre a throwaway
youre just another part of his transaction
tries to open the locked door will you open the door
so what what
youre his new nigger now
jimmy grabs at the door violently
open open the fucking door
you didnt kill that girl
containing his rage will you open the door
hes using you
i know it you know it
do the right thing
now get outta my fuckin car
bryer unlocks the door
jimmy exits and walks up the block
its nearly empty
ramon the limo driver plays solitaire at a computer
robert sits with syd in the next room
hes gonna walk
courts arent for certainty but he says he was at home why shouldnt he be
a phone call doesnt make him a liar
off roberts nod but whats baffling to me though despite your sentimental history together is why you would put your familys future in this kids hands
hes not like us
is that a good thing
laughs plays with his i dont know
robert stands and collects papers into his briefcase
stops packing looks up why
i heard something
she met with gil deuchman
the estate lawyer
has she mentioned anything
not to me
they sit in silence
we see jimmy in the witness box before grand jurors
the prosecutor deferlito asks questions
earl monroe sits next to jimmy
that was the early morning of april th
you received a phone call
who called you
jimmy stares at deferlito
it was a wrong number
thats a lie isnt it mr
you stayed on the phone one and a half minutes
grant isnt it the case that you know exactly who called you and exactly why
why are you lying to this court
im not lying
deferlito turns and walks back to the prosecutors table
he picks up a photograph and hands it to a clerk
im going to introduce into evidence peoples a
this is a toll booth photograph taken in the northbound ninth lane of the triborough bridge
grant directing your attention to the photograph would you please read the date and time stamp indicated on the lower right hand corner
jimmy stares at the photograph in disbelief
this is crazy
whispers in jimmys ear youre gonna have to answer that
grant please answer the question
april th two thirty three am
grant directing your attention to the same photograph would you please read the license plate number of the vehicle passing through the toll
d d g five five four two
handing in another sheet this is peoples b a printout from the department of motor vehicles plate registry
grant directing your attention to that printout are those numbers on the toll photograph the same ones that are on your own license plate
jimmys still staring at the picture
earl watches concerned
yes the numbers are the same
how do you explain that
but that is your car in this photograph isnt it
no that is not your car
off his silence answer the question mr
this is not my car in this picture
i dont know how you all did that but this is not my car
you expect this grand jury to believe that that is not your car when there is a printout from the department of motor vehicles
thats asked and answered mr
monroe you are aware that youre not permitted to go on record
jimmy bursts out of the courtroom doors trailed by earl
jimmy what was that
okay now heres what
before earl can finish responding bryer exits and walks over to them
i can halt the decision
we need a minute detective
what about you jimmy
you need a minute
jimmy doesnt answer
bryer sits down next to them
cause if you do we could
you can get the fuck outta my face
how bout that
so you wanna keep playing games
or you ready to tell me something
detective i need to talk to my client
now if you would just please
how you how you all just gonna lie like that
how you all just gonna lie
we didnt lie
that wasnt my car
jimmy dont say anything else

and it was a telemarketer called you from the pay phone
he stopped at the chevron to make a late night sale
that picture was some bullshit
detective whats going on
well tell him
go ahead jimmy
see how the bossll like this one
earl stares at jimmy waiting
the bell rings
bryer shakes his head and walks off
rising to jimmy wait here
bryer and earl enter the courtroom
jimmy as he stares out the th floor window towards brooklyn
in the distance the woolworth building
about thirty people in a room too big for them
at the front are tasteful flower bouquets surrounding julies casket
robert enters and spots some of the people from the art opening including julies gallery assistant
she looks at him quietly then quickly looks away
there is no organized service people are just walking up to the casket and saying prayers
robert takes his place and holds a moment at the casket
the gallery assistant comes up behind him
i would like to introduce you to julies mom sandrine
a beautiful woman in her s sandrine sits crying
robert approaches as she stands
i am so so sorry
nods then i just wanted to thank you for what you did for my daughter
shaking his head softly no
you believed in her and you gave her a chance
she was happy
i know she was happy
not fair is it
sandrine starts to tear
robert moves in and hugs her hard
this shouldnt have happened
hold on sandrines face in pain
close on brookes legs running on a treadmill
ellen exercises on a stairmaster next to her
we hear the sound of ellens small talk begin to fade in
shes rail thin
shes a blond
i would not have known who she was if she hadnt come up and introduced herself to me
she looked totally different
notices brooke increasing the machines resistance youre going straight to level six dont you think you better pace yourself a little bit
fakes a smile im good
i wanna run
everything okay with you and tom

heading to pick up her you know i cant stay for breakfast i have to just
i have to get in to work i dont know what i was thinking
did you uh finish the deal with the hospital

ellen stops her machine
issues related to the closing
we dont lie to each other brooke
im not lying to you
its complicated you wouldnt understand
ellen crosses closer to brooke blocking her exit
uh i know that a policeman showed up at the office
do you know what thats about
i honestly have no idea
what about your fathers head where he cut his head and the pain that hes hiding in his stomach and now starts to tear for some reason thats way to
complicated for me to understand theres no money for a routine gift
does that seem a little strange to you
of course its strange
so tell me whats happening
what do you want me to say
hes my dad
i have to trust him
you have to do whats right for you
not him not me not anyone
this is your life
ellen grabs brooke and hugs her hard
brooke hugs back kissing her mother on the cheek tearing
i love you
i gotta go
hold on ellen alone as brooke exits
james mayfield s waits alone at a table
they shake hands then sit

robert pulls out a pen and jots down the deal points they have just outlined onto the paper menu

mayfield thinks a moment then reaches over and signs the menu

as he heads away yeah
robert turns back to the table

mayfield shrugs and returns to his paper
robert walks out of the restaurant beaming
peter gavin and many of the various staff we have met are gathered around a long conference table
robert stands at the front of the room
anyway i will be seeing most of you at the gala tomorrow night

gavin walks off
roberts cell rings

reina jimmys girlfriend hispanic stands at the door with robert and jimmy

jimmy heads to the kitchen

robert walks out
reina crosses back into the living room as he approaches the door and exits
you gotta give him up

that was to keep quiet not to go away
whats he offering you now

reina crosses to jimmy and hugs him as he starts to cry then wipes away his tears
the limo drives down fifth avenue
roberts on the phone
we went to the toll authority

ive requested our investigator go examine it at the evidence room but honestly whats the point
he says he didnt take the toll
and you believe him

i really suggest you think about this

robert hangs up
he stares out the window at central park
he enters the foyer and ascends the steps to his bedroom
he looks at his watch pm
he moves over towards the bed and dials the tableside phone
miller say where she was going tonight
no im sure
ill try her cell
he clicks off and dials another number hears ellens voice mail come on the line and hangs up
he exhales and lies down on the bed in his clothes staring at the ceiling
he lies motionless a moment
and then he sits up thinks and shakes his head
he quickly picks up the phone stabbing at the keys
yeah did you make that call to the da yet
no no no
listen to me call earl tell him to get his car tell him to meet us at my house in twenty minutes
bring a notary
a steady stream of cars passes through the toll
we follow a blue lexus as it approaches the far right lane
earl monroe pays the toll clerk through the window getting a receipt
then he pulls his car to the side of the road parking at a building labelled port authority administration
he opens a laptop on the passenger seat typing numbers from the toll receipt into a little box on the screen
a portable printer spits out pages
earl stamps them with a notary
earl waits at the front desk of the drab government office
brent a balding man in his s approaches
hi im brent owens the night supervisor
how can i help you
handing him some papers hello brent
im earl monroe
im executing a criminal evidence request
i need to get a look at one of your lane tapes
brent looks over the papers confused
i dont understand
this says you want to look at a tape made ten minutes ago
robert and syd stare ahead silently
syd tries to say something
holding up his hand wait
syd slumps back
they keep staring at nothing
a rapping noise on the window startles syd who rolls it down sees earl and opens the door
earl climbs inside removing a folio from his breast pocket as he talks
okay they wont release tapes without a court order but they did give me a print out the same kind they used at jimmys indictment
earl reaches inside the folio and removes the photograph he got from the toll authority
he lays it on the counter
its from a toll camera showing his car and license plate
the lexus thats your car your plate
you got jimmys
syd lays the photograph we saw earlier of jimmys car going through the toll onto the counter next to the one earl has just placed there
robert picks up a high end magnifying glass and leans over to look at the two photos
he scans the photograph of earls car moving slowly through it left to right
then he scans the photograph of jimmys car passing left to right until he passes back by the license plate area and stops the lines around the license plate of
jimmys car are all slightly pixelated
he switches back to the plate on earls car
the lines are fine
back to jimmys
robert puts down the magnifier straightens and smiles
son of a bitch
earls dark laugh cackles across the soundtrack as we earl sits across from da deferlito and bryer
judge rittenband reviews both toll photos with a magnifying glass
well they look a little different to me too
is there a reason you havent allowed mr
monroes investigator to conduct his own analysis
weve had some issues regarding chain of custody
you dont have them anymore
youre to meet him with the evidence in the next hour
im afraid thats not possible
wheres the tape
am i not speaking loud enough
it seems theres been
let him tell me
we dont know where it is
its not in the evidence locker
where is it
we dont know
rittenband leans forward
ill ask you one last time detective
where is the tape
after a beat we lost it
in light of these developments and i would think you should be very happy to hear this with mr
monroes approval im going to offer mr
deferlito the opportunity to voluntarily dismiss the indictment to save us all a bunch of embarrassment
i dont feel comfortable with that your honor
further im going to put all charges against mr
grant under seal
bryer starts heading to this case is dismissed with prejudice and it is not to be refiled
hold on detective
if you have another suspect in the automobile death then you are to present him but mr
grant is free from any further inquiry in this matter
this is over
do i have your understanding
deferlito gets up angrily huffs past bryer
close the door detective please
bryer closes it
the judge holds up the toll photos
you finessed these didnt you
you finessed it
i know it and you know it
i know who youre after
i saw all the evidence not just the toll photo
you gotta get him the right way
approaches the judge so let me get this straight what youre telling me is im supposed to sit around with my thumb up my ass and my fingers crossed hoping
that one of these fucking days somewhere down the line one of these rich assholes is gonna say the wrong thing loud enough so that we cant choose to ignore it anymore
get the fuck outta of my office
yes your honor
mills waits on a nearby bench watching as bryer exits the chambers dialing his phone
deferlito walks up to bryer and grabs him
bryer breaks free aggressively phone to his ear
bryer waves him away
on the phone well when do you expect her
when do you expect her

ellen is dressed in a full ball gown
she sits at on the sofa finishing a drink
robert enters and begins changing into a tuxedo

and you broke that understanding when you brought brooke into it

when you made brooke complicit when you risked her future and im done
she opens a folder revealing some legal documents slides them toward him
what is this
he crosses to the bed and puts on his glasses
we see the title separation agreement and hold on him reading for a few brief seconds until
all ownership and voting rights transfer to the miller charitable foundation to be administered by brooke miller

we hold on roberts face
pre lap bill evans my foolish heart
the car rides up madison avenue
mayfield marks up a bunch of memos in a leather bound folder
an aide we met earlier john aimes sits nearby
theres just one more thing
and i hate to mention it now but i just received it
aimes opens a folder handing it to mayfield
i had stern marling run a secondary audit on the miller financials
we catch a glimpse of the top sheet as mayfield reads stern marling confidential audit miller capital we have reviewed the records you submitted and have found no way to
legitimately substantiate a recent capital transfer of million
we hold on mayfields face as he tries hard to conceal the spreading realization
who authorized this
after a beat and what did you conclude
its in front of you
i didnt ask you what the paper said john
i asked you what you thought
after a beat carefully well
what do you think
that i dont see anything wrong here
mayfield closes the folder and places it with the rest of his papers
they arrive at the plaza hotel and exit the car we see throngs of the wealthy ascend the steps leading up to the opulent hall
lining the walls are plaques for mt
sinai hospital miller oncology center
seated at one of the many round tables are robert ellen peter gavin syd jeffrey and a few spouses and attendants
chamber music plays while everyone eats dinner
we focus in on robert as he stares intently out into the room his eyes a mixture of ferocity and resignation
in the distance we hear a speakers voice fade in
and to receive this prestigious award i invite now to the stage the man who led this generous effort and whose financial trading firm miller capital has just this morning
been acquired by standard bank and trust a dedicated businessman family man scholar philanthropist and all around humanitarian a man i am lucky to call my mentor my friend and my father mr
