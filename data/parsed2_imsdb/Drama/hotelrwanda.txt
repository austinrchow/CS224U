written by keir pearson terry george a burning white sun high in a clear blue sky a rundown sixties airport peeling in the heat
a mad traffic jam of cars vans motorbikes all stopped at a checkpoint where a rwandan policeman blows his whistle waves some and stops others as bored rwandan soldiers look
close on a white van pulls out of traffic a balls out case of line jumping
a hand extends from the passenger side of the van rwandan francs pressed neatly between thumb and palm
the van stops next to the policeman
rusesabagina good morning
in the passenger seat paul rusesabagina late s flashes a smile
he is dressed in a sharp blue suit always dressed in a neat suit and tie it is a matter of pride
a quick shake of hands
money passes from one to the other
the van parked by the runway tarmac
african music plays on the radio
paul drums his fingers checks his watch
zozo porter driver early thirties sits nervously
an airport baggage handler approaches the van
sir the flight is delayed one more hour
to zozo he can get the beer
suddenly worried rutagandas place
beg your pardon sir you are hutu
you are safe there
you are with me zozo dont worry
zozo throws the van into gear and speeds off
the white van marked the hotel mille collines whips its way through kigalis packed streets and open air markets
zozo works the horn weaves in and out of traffic
what is it like to fly on a plane sir
it depends where you sit zozo
in coach it is like the bus to giterama
that is why they call it coach
but in business class there are fine wines linens belgian chocolates
impressed you have taken business class
suddenly zozo slows
paul looks up sees a gathering on the side of the road a large crowd of men dressed in exotically yet identically colored shirts
theyre members of the interahamwe the hutu militia
interahamwe the hutu militia will de distinguished by these wildly colored shirts they chant drink beer dance onto the road obstructing cars threatening the occupants
several of them perform a rhythmic dance the interahamwe war dance to thumping drumbeat music from a boombox
zozo scared looks for a side road studies the traffic behind
there is nowhere to turn sir
as the van approaches slow down
the van pulls up beside the militia
boys do you know the way to mr
some militia approach
they are suddenly friendly helpful
it is one more mile on this road
paul reaches into his pocket takes out some rwandan dollars
this is thirsty work let me treat you to some beers
as the van pulls away zozo looks to paul relieved
at his desk in front of a fan
george rutagunda late s huge gold chains rolex watch like an african mafia boss but the same interahamwe shirt
he squeezes an orange rind into a cup of espresso
behind him through his office window the white van is being loaded with cases of beer
george holds out his massive shirt
you will join us at the rally today
paul sits opposite sipping coffee
i will try my best george but these days i have no time for rallies or politics
politics is power paul
paul studies his watch
time is money george
we need extra beer today
business is good at the hotel
i am always glad to see you paul
george leads paul out into the warehouse
as a forklift lifts a wooden crate george angers
hell man that is not beer put it back
but sir the carlsberg is behind
forget the carlsberg give him grolsch
to paul i wont charge extra
the driver of the forklift anxiously spins the machine to return the crate but it slides off and crashes onto the floor machetes hundreds of them spill out
an awkward moment then george picks one of the crude blades
a bargain buy from china
ten cents each ill get a dollar
off zozo terrified
a sabena airliner lands
passengers disembark via a roll up staircase
pauls van pulls up by the luggage belt
a large polystyrene box comes down the conveyor belt
it has brussels kigali destination stickers all over it
as zozo picks it up water sloshes from the lid
the ice has melted
zozo goes to open it
paul slips money to two customs officials
the van speeds through traffic
more traffic jams zozo edges up on the sidewalk
then at an intersection they see
the interahamwe parade a mass of young men and women most in the same colorful uniform
line after line waves all performing the interahamwe war dance in wild hypnotic sync many wave sticks spears wooden imitation guns
a large banner reads hutu power
a flatbed truck speakers blare drumbeat music
on it george rutagunda dances the dance and waves a machete to the crowd
zozo sinks down behind the wheel
sit up smile zozo dont attract attention to yourself
boss some of those men are my neighbors they know im tutsi
the parade passes
as they wait paul takes out the wad of notes george gave him peels off a few dollars
here zozo for your trouble
zozo takes it
the van turns off the street into the milles collines hotel driveway and honks twice as it pulls down a short drive lined with tall shrubs
an armed guard rushes from his booth and lifts the gate
the van doesnt even have to slow as it passes
a sign on the guard house reads welcome to the hotel mille collines
lush tropical gardens peacocks wander the well manicured lawns an exotic african paradise
the van heads to a magnificent colonial building
pull up at the front door
a valet opens the front door of the hotel and looks shocked
its unheard of for a service van to stop out front
urgent to the valet help zozo
paul leads zozo and the valet into a magnificent lobby a tasteful blend of africa and europe
guests stare as water sloshes and spills from the crate
gregoire early thirties the receptionist behind the desk throws a look of disapproval
paul imperial snaps his finger toward him
re spilled water gregoire
take care of this
gregoire engages a guest in chit chat ignores paul
see to this right away
the elevator door opens and reveals bik the belgian hotel manager mid s reading some reports
he looks up sees paul and zozo carrying the box as they step in
bik looks puzzled
its an emergency sir
now bik sees the wet floor
gregoire will deal with it excuse me
the elevator doors shut
biks left standing in disbelief
the crate is hefted onto a counter
the top pried off
a crowd of cooks gathers around paul and zozo as they peer in
any of them make it
into the sink
they hoist up one end of the crate and lobsters spill out
many make it into the sink but some miss and slide across the counter and fall onto the floor
the cooks sort the living from the dead
twelve are dead
the cooks smells a dead lobster shakes his head no
dump the bad meat save the shells fill them will ah a stuffing something local
cassava and tipali
call it fresh scottish lobster in a cassava and tipali crush
paul fixes his tie very pleased another crisis solved
paul inspects the tables fresh flowers sparkling crystal glasses
he looks to the bar grolsch on ice
the sound of african drums fills the air
paul emerges as a troupe of african male dancers in ceremonial costume leopard skin dress ostrich feather head dress spears and shields perform a greeting dance for a the american
ambassador and a crowd of european dignitaries
the male dancers are joined by a troupe of young female dancers in similar ceremonial dress
the ceremony comes to a foot stomping finale
the guests break into loud applause
paul flings open double doors to a reception room and the crowd moves in
ambassador please come in
thank you paul
a un colonel oliver middle aged canadian follows the us ambassador
the colonel wear the blue berets and armbands of un peacekeepers
all un troops will be distinguished by their bright blue berets white helmets and arm bands colonel oliver you are very welcome
the ambassador shakes the colonels hand
id like you to meet mr
colson of our regional aid division
colson crew cut military build is obviously cia
colonel oliver is the liason officer for the u
peace keeping forces
paul backs away unnoticed
then marches into the busy kitchen claps his hands toward a gathering of waiters
please serve the hors douvres now
a waiter whispers to him
general bizimungu wants to see you
paul heads out of the kitchen
a luxurious lounge club called the kigali club an african casablanca complete with animal heads a statue of a mountain gorilla grand piano in the corner
rwandan hutu army officers distinguished by their crisp khaki uniforms in the style of the french army arms dealers government dignitaries businessmen and reporters mingle freely
the few tourists stand out
paul heads to a table
the center of attention and conversation is general bizimungu s dressed in a crisp heavily decorated uniform a strong figure relaxed in control
paul this scotch is exceptional
its a single malt glenmorangie
i thought youd like it
anything you need gentlemen let me know
oh paul talk to the coat check please
paul heads for the lobby
hes intercepted by an zealous young tutsi reporter benedict who covers the political scene for the local independent newspaper
paul paul a moment please
yes benedict what can i do
can you get me into the ambassadors reception
im sorry its a private function
benedict takes out his reporters notebook
at least tell me who is attending
the newspaper will be grateful
i will be grateful if you keep my name out of your newspaper
wait here and you will see who has attended as they leave
paul fixes a floral arrangement as he passes then arrives at the clock room hatch
to the coat check did general bizimungu bring a briefcase
take it to the bar storeroom
put three bottles of glenmorangie
he writes it down on a pad glen mor an gie into it
paul moves off as the coat check scurries away
oh paul paul an american woman connie denver rich blonde surgically enhanced stands by the door of the tourism office
paul walks into the tourism office
it is decorated with posters and photos of rwandas single most important economic asset the rare silver back mountain gorillas
theres a picture of the real life diane fossey next to the movie poster for gorillas in the mist
numerous books and video cassettes
connie denvers older husband bob and four american friends wait
our trip has been cancelled
yes im sorry madame denver it is because of the rebels
dont be stupid for christ sake
the watusis are invading the country
i told you not to come here
the tutsi rebels are far away on the border
and soon there will be peace
tutsis watutsis theyll still shoot you
but i came here to see the gorillas
i will try to arrange something
the luncheon is in full swing
paul glides in the background
close on the ambassador in deep conversation with oliver
things will calm down when the president signs the peace agreement with the rebels
our intelligence mr
ambassador is that the hutu government has been stockpiling weapons and are preparing a massacre
thats not what i hear
paul comes over colonel you know the house manager paul rusesabagina
how was your meal sir
reads scottish lobster in rwanda
you see general what a genius this man is
you want anything this man can get it
how about a battalion of u
now general dont ask for the impossible
i have heard mr
ambassador that they have discovered oil here under lake kivu
oliver bursts out laughing
youre right mr
ambassador paul knows how to get anything even u
the ambassador takes pauls hand shakes it warmly
thank you for a wonderful meal paul
paul moves away graciously and in one smooth move checks out then pockets the hundred dollar bill the ambassador palmed him
general bizimungu gazes through glass into the reception room sees paul shake hands and joke with the ambassador
paul notices the general
the general raises his briefcase and waves
paul waves back
another favor rendered
it is night now
floodlights bathe the hotel in a warm glow
tiki oil lamps illuminate the walkways and spread scented citronella smoke among the trees
wild birds call out
paul walks to the employee car park at the rear
he sees gregoire and another male reception clerk tossing zozos pillbox porters hat between them with zozo trapped in the middle trying to jump and catch it
gregoire thinks this tease is great fun
come on zozo cockroaches can jump some of them can fly
he clerk sees paul just as hes about to throw miscalculates the hat sails over gregoires head and lands at pauls feet
zozo scampers to pick it up
points to gregoire you pick it up
gregoire doesnt move
how are your dish washing skills gregoire
gregoire bends picks up the hat hands it to zozo who walks away quickly
gregoire and his friend turn to head back into the hotel
gregoire there are no cockroaches in this hotel do you understand
bik has walked out of the rear door and overheard
dont tell me we have cockroaches paul
a sly smile breaks on gregoires face as he uses biks arrival to disappear inside
no bik its a code word for tutsis
thats what i came to talk to you about
the hutu tutsi thing
the bbc faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords
and the u
wants the banquet room for that day a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony
can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish
leave it to me
bik leans slightly closer
also could you remember to use the service entrance at all times
paul hops in his car and tosses a box of belgium chocolates on the seat next to him
paul speeds through the streets of kigali humming along to music on the radio and eating chocolates from the box
he passes bicycles laden with produce
the song on the radio ends and local news comes on
good hutus of rwanda beware
the dictatorship of the tutsi cockroach is near
watch your neighbor
identify these cockroaches
then rise up and stamp out this murderous infestation
paul turns the station
finds another with music
lights burn in windows
kids play soccer in dusty lots
pauls van turns onto a residential street and slows
he honks twice
the metal gate to a walled compound swings open
a guard old peaked hat bare feet pathetic stands just inside
paul waves to him and pullsinto the courtyard two cars are already parked there
a neat bungalow and gardens behind the high wall
paul parks and gets out
a dog runs and greets him barking
his wife tatiana a woman of great natural beauty emerges from the house beside her an even taller very elegant woman she has a doctors bag and a stethoscope in
this is odette their family doctor and close friend
good evening odette who is sick this time
i asked odette to take a look at little anais
she has a rash
your brothers here
yes with fedens and the children
e wants some advice
good to see you paul
paul embraces odette warmly kisses tatiana
i must go paul
you will not stay for dinner
no thank you tatiana
my best to jean baptiste
the old guard opens the gate odette drives off
a sigh thomas wants advice
he wants your wisdom
lets have dinner first
his brother in law thomas and sister in law fedens come out to greet paul the patriarch
kids run everywhere
paul spots his twin nieces anais in blue and carine in yellow four years old
he scoops them up one in each arm
i am carine
you are not anais
i am anais
oh carine that is a shame
i have a present for anais
anais reaches out her hand
paul sets them on the ground takes a chocolate from his chocolate box deliberately hands it to carine
anais jumps up and down
it is for me
goodness i cannot tell
i guess i must find another present
he takes a chocolate gives it to carine then hands out the chocolates to his children who are gathered around
a crowded family table
tatiana pauls four children thomas and fedens and the twins anais and carine
roger your turn
pauls eldest roger bows his head
for food and clothes and all that grows etc etc
dear lord thank you
thank you roger
food is passed around
roger gobbles his down
why the hurry roger
simon has a new pet
can i go see it
no i dont want you going on the street
please papa i have a secret path
who is this simon
simon next door the charingas boy
and he did extra chores
wash your things and be back soon
roger takes off at a run
roger runs to a wooden fence gets down moves two boards and squeezes through into a path almost a tunnel in dense reeds
roger crawls along his path
theres a gap a little way down and roger shoots through it into the wide open of the neighbors yard
he runs to a back window of the house and taps on it
soon simon appears
he slides it open
lets feed it
simon lets roger in
roger holds a wildly colored snake in a jar
simon has a bag of bugs
waves the bag in front of the snake
its forked tongue goes wild
simon hands him the bugs
roger lifts the lid drops one bug in and the snake strikes
the boys jump back laugh
after dinner coffee for the adults
tatiana thomas and fedens at the table
paul in his usual position at the head listening like solomon
ive heard bad things paul
my assistant says we should get out of rwanda
why should we leave
i have a new job things have never been better for us
what good is it if we are murdered in our bed
your assistant he is hutu
yes and he is in the hutu power militia
he wants your job
no he is a friend but he tells me to listen to the radio
all day they talk about the great slaughter
that station is filth
paul has listened now he decides to speak
today i talked to my friend the american ambassador and colonel oliver of the united nations
they are preparing a banquet for the peace signing
the bbc are flying in their best reporters
the world is watching
there will be peace
dont listen to this man
solomon has spoken
fedens smiles tatiana rubs pauls arm
roger crawls along his grass tunnel
then he hears something
he looks through the reeds toward the street
he sees military boots a cluster of hutu soldiers in their crisp khaki uniforms
he hears whispering
paul tatiana are by thomass car
they say good night to their guests
anais and carine sleep in the car
paul nods to the old guard to go open the gate
just then roger emerges from the thicket wide eyed afraid
there are soldiers
on the street
paul nods to tatiana to take roger inside
thomas and fedens grab the sleeping twins from their car
paul goes to his big metal gates and peers through the two inch gap between the gate hinge and the gate post
he sees two houses down the group of hutu soldiers clustered around jeeps they whisper and point
its a raid
now they move rushing out of view
the sounds of splintering wood glass breaking childrens cries women suddenly theres a face beside pauls
what is it
she looks sees the soldiers as they drag a middle aged man onto the street
he is crying pleading like a whipped dog
oh my god its victor
why do they want victor
they watch as victor is beaten to the jeep
at this point victor looses it completely stops pleading grabs on to a soldier clinging screaming like a terrified child like a man who knows he is going to die
its a horror
call your friends in the army
victor is harmless
this is a mistake
please be quiet
tatiana moves toward the gate handle
im going to talk to them
paul grabs her
we must do something
paul takes her by the arm leads her to the house
what would you have us do
argue with these madmen
we cannot interfere
thomas and fedens wait anxious as paul appears
you better stay the night it is too dangerous to be on the streets
tatiana hides her anger
ill fix a bed
paul lies in bed unable to sleep
the clock reads am
why didnt you call your contacts in the army
i couldnt help
you could have asked for a favor
no i could not
what do you know about favors tatiana about barter and deals
all day long i work to please this officer that diplomat this tourist
to store up favors so that if there is a time when my family need help i have powerful people i can call upon
now you would have me waste a precious favor on a stranger
victor was not a stranger he was our neighbor
he was not family
family is all that matters
do you think if you or i were being dragged from here any one of them would lift a finger to help us
they do not have your connections
i have no connections only favors
if i call to help victor a general will think paul rusesabagina is a fool
he thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody
then my hard work is doubly squandered
i insult the general and i do not get to use my favor at all
please leave these things to my good judgment
his turn away indicates the discussion is over
pauls car rolls up to the hotels guard house
super the title april th
an army jeep is parked just inside
general bizimungu is in the passenger seat talking into a walkie talkie
the general gives an ill see you soon wave
the hotel entrance is a mini jam of airport buses white un jeeps foreign news crew land rovers and a tv repair van unloading monitors
paul marches in past zozo the bell hop who helps the tv men unload
the lobby buzzes with activity
at the reception gregoire is surrounded by a bbc news crew gloria young chic female reporter producer and jock tough experienced scottish cameraman and his local sound guy peter
gloria is upset
we reserved five rooms not two im sorry maam but i see only two here in the computer
jock sees paul
paul how the hell are ya
i am delighted to see you mr
they moved you from the diplomat
good for you
moves closer were having a little trouble paul
we booked five rooms but
paul moves behind the desk
let me check
he punches into the computer
ah i see the mistake
you were reading cbc the canadian broadcasting people instead of bbc gregoire
close on the computer it clearly states bbc two rooms
gregoire looks to paul with a mix of puzzlement and anger
of course the bbc five rooms
lies they are being prepared as we speak
i have ordered fresh flowers and complimentary champagne
gloria picks up her bag
great i really need a shower
just give me a moment to get your keys
paul better come up with three rooms fast
then he spots the reporter benedict hovering at the door
to gloria excuse me for one second
paul hurries over to benedict
benedict you should meet the bbc people
they could use your expertise
benedict is delighted
they head back across the lobby
whisper benedict general bizimungu will be here any moment
the bbc should talk to him
they join the bbc team
madame this is benedict nangori one of our best journalists
he covers all the big stories
i thought you should meet
gloria a consummate news producer turns on the charm
benedict beautiful name
im gloria fleming
paul moves off to the desk gregoire can barely disguise his pleasure
there are no more rooms
give me the phone
gregoire hands it over
i have very good news
i have a present for you in return for the cancellation of your gorilla expedition i have arranged a safari at lake kivu lodge
a wonderful experience
no no extra charge
a luxury coach will leave in one hour
ill send maids up to help you all pack
paul hangs up turns to gregoire
call kivu lodge ask for george tell him i need three rooms
and send a team of maids up to the americans
i want those rooms turned around in twenty minutes
paul heads for the glass doors and sees general bizimungu briefcase in hand gives the tv interview hes confident controlled benedict stands close by as gloria interviews
there are rumors general that your army the hutu army consider these peace accords a sellout to the tutsi rebels
at this moment we are making plans to rehabilitate the dissidents into our armed forces
then the army fully supports the president as he signs the peace agreement
of course the president is a clever man he knows what he is doing
thank you for coming to rwanda
on the move
you will see what a beautiful country this is
paul turns walks past porters ferrying the bbc luggage
he puts his hand out
gregoire hands him keys
paul does his rounds
he double checks the banquet room where technicians install several tv monitors and test the signal
he looks in the kitchen frenzied activity
he wanders behind the bar
everything is under control
he returns to the lobby greets connie her flustered husband and their friends followed by a team of porters and luggage
forgive the hurry but i do not want you to miss the lunch buffet on the paddle steamer across the lake
it is the most spectacular sight in all africa
all we do is eat
i thought there was famine in africa
exactly we cant have our guests starving
what would they think of the mille collines back in the united states
bizimungu takes pauls arm pulls him aside hands him his empty briefcase
keep that cockroach benedict away from me
as the general disappears into the bar paul waves over the coat check hands her the briefcase
same as last time
she nods hurries off just as the bbc crew appears
paul hands out keys greets each
the fifth room is your broadcast room
id like to book a massage
jock the scottish cameraman hangs behind as the others leave takes his key
did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the diplomat with you
im sorry mr
daglish this is the mille collines
no working girls here
can we phone them in paul
im afraid i cant do that mr
paul calls zozo over
you remember zozo from the diplomat
jock gets the code instantly as zozo smiles
the very man
the scot and zozo greet then hurry off
paul supervises waiters hanging a banner
it reads peace love and brotherhood
reporters watch rows of tvs
all broadcast the signing of the arusha accords
reporters have political chatter
close on the tvs as president habyarimana signs
as president habyarimana signs a peace accord between the tutsi rebels and his hutu army there remains strong doubts that the extremist hutu power will abide by the accords
but for now hope has returned to rwanda for the first time in many years
all the african reporters in the room cheer
fireworks go off outside the hotel
colonel oliver raises a glass of champagne and leads the room in a toast
the room as one raise their glasses
close on paul as he nods to a member of the tribal band on the small stage
then african drummers hammer out a fast uplifting beat as the full troupe of ceremonial dancers skip into the room in celebration
paul checks out the banques
they appear empty then a voice
paul join us
its general bizimungu he is sitting with george rutagunda now in a shiny blue suit
a bottle of whiskey on the table is almost gone
bizimungu and rutagunda watch the peace celebration across the lobby
have a drink
george points his glass toward the europeans
look at them they want to see the tribes dance to their tune
here is our dance
rutagunda staggers to his feet launches into a drunken version of the hutu militia war dance
come on paul
show them our dance
paul takes georges arm does two steps of the dance then appears to stumble and shoulder bumps the big man
george falls into his chair
forgive me george my step was off
rutagunda bursts out laughing toasts to our president
may he find peace
as paul is forced to join in the toast rutagunda laughs bizimungu smiles at some insider joke
reporters and crews pack up their equipment
paul shakes hands orders porters to pick up cases
then a porter whispers a message to paul
excuse me gentlemen
paul emerges discovers fedens and thomas they look embarrassed to be in such exulted surroundings
forgive us paul
we must talk
we are leaving rwanda paul
go to the terrace i will join you
drinks are served at a table as paul listens to thomas
my assistant the hutu power man says we should get out now that soon it will be very bad
paul stifles his anger
give me this mans name
his name is naramaranga but please paul even though he is hutu power he is a friend he likes me
he told me there is a signal
it is cut the tall trees
when they hear the signal the militia are to go to war
please let us take tatiana with us
you are hutu you will be safe
thomas fedens i am a man who looks after his family
if there were danger i would be the first to leave
bang a distant explosion a flash of light on the far side of the city
what was that
calm yourself it is fireworks to celebrate the peace
please paul tomorrow i will bring you my car
you will sell it for me and get a fair price
we will go to tanzania until there is real peace
excuse me paul you have a call
zozo hands paul a cordless phone
yes they are here
i know but i want them to calm down
thomas and fedens listen
already the press are packing their bags
the bbc man told me theres no story here
we are boring now
ill be home soon
he hangs up
let us all go home and sleep
paul escorts fedens and thomas to their car
call when you get home
and dont worry thomas
pauls at the wheel driving
a thick mist
barely a car on the road
shadows dart past faint house lights
the windscreen clouds
paul switches on his wipers
a toyota truck loaded with militia appears from the mist speeds past
paul switches the preset buttons on the radio as he drives
he can only find fevered drum based music
paul turns onto his street
the houses are dark windows shuttered gates closed not a soul about
paul stops before his gate
the gate doesnt open
he hops out and opens it with a key
gives it a push and pauses as he heads back to the car
he hears the far off sound of gunfire
distant explosions light the night sky
paul drives in
his compound is curiously dark
his headlights sweep across his pitch black house
the gates swing shut
we pull back as paul turns and faces his house
paul whistles for the dog nothing
he goes back to the car gets a flashlight heads for the front door
the door slowly opens
paul steps in quietly tries the light switch nothing
the only sounds are distant explosions and gunfire
the beam of his flashlight cuts the blackness illuminating magazines arranged on a coffee table an empty chair childrens toys in a basket
paul continues his search
scans the counter
theres food on the stove
the table is set
he hears a growl quickly cut short from one of the bedrooms
paul shines the light into a room
looks for a second then closes the door and walks to the next
he stops and listens with his ear to the door
he pushes it in
pauls light sweeps across the room and illuminates eyes terrified eyes a room full of faces staring back
their pov a dark figure behind a blinding light
the dog breaks free runs to paul
from among the faces tatianas voice heavy with relief
pauls eyes adjust he recognizes many of his neighbors all crowded into this small room
then he sees their friends odette and her husband jean baptiste
our house has been burned
what is going on
the president has been murdered
the radio says tutsi rebels
why would the rebels kill the president when he agreed to peace
tatiana pulls paul aside
where are thomas and fedens
i sent them home
go and call them
i tried already
the phones do not work
jean baptiste turns on his tiny radio
our great president is murdered by the tutsi cockroaches
they tricked him then they killed him
we must cleanse this country good hutus of rwanda
we must clear the brush
clear the brush of all cockroaches
clear the brush
the words are cut short as a grenade blast rattles the window
everyone jumps children whimper
paul is shocked but tries to pull things together
come on everyone out of this room find a seat in the living room
he holds the door open they file out frightened
tatiana is last he stops her steps back in closes the door
in hushed anger is every tutsi in the neighborhood here
they came through the bushes over the wall
what could i do
send them home
we are not the police
what do we have to protect them
let them stay til morning
the militia will not come here they know you are a hutu with influence
they know you are tutsi
the door knocks
paul gets up angry
please paul til first light
then they go
paul opens the door its odette holding the hand of pauls eldest daughter
forgive me paul
danielle says that roger has gone
tatiana comes over instantly worried
tell me danielle
their daughter danielle answers
next door mama
he was afraid for his friend simon
he went to fetch him
roger crawls between the shrubs
he hears angry voices
he peers through the long grass
sees hutu soldiers boots feet in sneakers bare womens feet
and among them the glint of machetes hoes a club spiked with nails a length of chain clanging on the ground
tatiana rushes out the front door paul after her
paul catches her and puts his hand over her mouth
shouts next door
paul pulls tatiana behind the car
paul takes his hand from her mouth
roger crawls to the gap in the shrubs
feet a crowd leaving through a gate
roger crawls from the bushes
crawls across the driveway crawls through a puddle
then stops sees something an unseen horror
paul and tatiana exit the back of the house with flashlight in hand headed towards the rear gate
paul searches along the chain link fence finds a section loose he pulls it back clambers underneath it
tatiana clasps her mouth afraid to utter a cry
paul crawls through this scrub tunnel
then he hears branches snapping
he moves toward the sound
discovers roger terrified thrashing in a tangle of bushes
he grabs rogers shirt pulls him as the little boy startles
paul drags his son through the chainlink fence whisks him up in his arms and rushes him to the house
paul bursts through the back door and sets roger down
tatiana is beside them
paul turns the flashlight on roger
tatiana pulls back in horror roger is covered in blood
her screams stifled by fear
oh my god
where are you hurt son
oger stares blankly
odette is beside them now
get his clothes off
hands pull and tear his clothes off
towels wipe him down
odette looks all over his body with the flashlight
despite the blood roger has no injuries
what happened son
where did you get this blood
but roger trembling just stares totally traumatized
hes not injured
his paralysis freaks the women in the room
paul turns angrily to them
leave us give us some space
he ushers the neighbors out of the room closes the door
to tatiana the neighbors must go at dawn
tatiana hugs her son
the faintest grey of dawn over the city
then a flock of birds rises as one in the distance
a millisecond later the cause of their flight a grenade explosion echoes
the birds dart in another direction as the staccato of a machine gun rips the air
paul sits on the edge of the bed staring out the window
behind him tatiana has roger cradled in her arms he still trembles wide eyed as she tries to get him to talk
will you take a little milk
let him sleep
the door knocks
the old guard calls in frightened
to tatiana it is time for the neighbors to leave
he heads for the door
paul steps out closes the door behind him
a small delegation of the men wait nervously
it is true
he holds up the tiny radio tuned to the bbc world service a crackly brit voice
its gloria the reporter
the hutu presidents plane was struck by a ground to air missile as he returned from signing the peace accord with the tutsi rebels
there were no survivors
the hutu government has already blamed the tutsi rebels
the rebels have denied the accusation
already there are reports of reprisal killings on the streets
as they listen a young woman lets out a squeal and flees the window where shes been sitting
they are here
hysteria in the room women and children push toward the bedroom
paul manages to make it to the window nervously steals a glance and sees a hutu army soldier sits on the high wall by the gate
he pulls another up beside him
anic in the room now
pauls pov the soldiers drop into his garden
they draw pistols
what is it paul
stay with the children
pauls pov the soldiers go to the gate slide the bolt swing it open
two jeeps jammed with heavily armed soldiers sit in the drive like many limbed beasts of war
paul watches as the jeeps rumble into his garden
the soldiers jump out
nothing can stop the women and children from fleeing into the bedrooms
paul is frozen at the crash of rifles on the door
the door gives soldiers flood in
they are startled by the crowd in the living room rifles raised
out get out now
paul pulls himself together marches over to the soldier
who is in charge
a captain is at the door
who are you
i am paul rusesabagina a good friend of general bizimungu
we are looking for you
he takes paul by the arm leads him outside
the captain stops by his jeep studies his clipboard
tatiana with roger in her arms her kids and all the neighbors herded together
what is this about
let me see your identity card
paul pulls it from his pocket hands it to the captain
close on pauls id it reads ethnicity hutu
the captain studies him waves for the soldiers to back off
you heard the tutsi cockroaches murdered our president
yes it is a calamity for us all
you work at the hotel diplomat
i work at the mille collines
the captain looks confused
paul quickly i used to work at the diplomat
do you know how to open the safe there
paul nods our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe
you must open it
paul sees out into the street behind the jeeps a group of militia in their colored shirts armed with machetes have gathered trying to see what is going on
captain i must take my family
it is not safe here
where is your family
tatiana is beside him now
interrupts this is them
tatiana points to the huddled neighbors
paul is stunned
all of them
i cannot take them
no no good captain you do not have to
we have the car and our van
she points to the mille collines van
he captain looks doubtful then his two way radio barks an urgent message
tatiana drags the kids and ushers everyone toward the van
in a second they are all clambering in
paul jumps behind the wheel of the van
neighbors are jammed in like sardines more inside
tatiana and their kids are squashed together on the front bench
the convoy jeep van car jeep starts up and turns out into the street
the militia men wave sticks machetes
paul looks back as they speed off down the street
sees the militia looters pour into his gateway
as they pass the caringa home militia looters carry off a tv and push a stove on a childs skateboard
tatiana has roger on her lap she cradles his head
the convoy speeds through the deserted streets
slowing only to maneuver through makeshift roadblocks where militia wave machetes nailed clubs and spears as they dance
further along the road a group of militia swarm over a car smashing the windshield the windows
inside a family huddles together in terror waiting for the windows to give way
in the gutter by the side of the road three dead bodies
to tatiana dont look
the convoy pulls up at this older shabbier hotel
there are other jeeps and several staff in a panic
the janitor robert sees paul bursts into waves of joy
we must open every door right now for the government
paul jumps out of the van hurries to the lead jeep
to the captain the safe is in the managers office
the captain nods to two soldiers
go with him get the keys
paul runs through the lobby
the staff look petrified
paul bursts into the room
the two soldiers follow
he goes to the hotels big old combination safe spins the combination a few times tries the handle clunk
it doesnt open
hes forgotten the number
the soldiers look at him impatiently
gentlemen youll find some chocolate and maybe a few beers in the fridge

the soldiers fall over each other to get to the fridge
paul tries the safe numbers again clunk
he sees a big bunch of keys a wad of dollars rwandan francs a check book and several bottles of the best cognac whiskey some cristal
he looks round nervously but the two soldiers are busy fighting over the beer and chocolates in the fridge
s they do paul hands trembling stuffs the wads of notes into his belt pulls his shirt over and shuts the safe door

he is about to leave
paul looks back at the soldier
paul sits as the two soldiers guzzle beers and stuff chocolate into their pockets
paul hurries through the lobby toward the entrance
paul emerges to see all of the occupants of the van tatiana his kids odette on their knees with their hands on their heads
the captain hovers over them pistol in hand turns sees paul
he marches toward him and slaps him hard on the face
paul reels from the blow but manages to stay on his feet
the captain snatches a bunch of id cards from a soldier hurls the cards in pauls face
they are all tutsi cockroaches
let me explain
he grabs paul by the scruff of the neck pushes him toward the kneeling captives
the captain snatches a pistol from one of his soldiers shoves it into pauls hand
paul looks at him
please i dont use guns
there is nothing to it
the captain raises his own pistol and fires it
everyone jumps with fright
shoot them now or you die first
the captain aims his pistol at pauls head
cocks the hammer
captain what could i pay you not to do this
the captain laughs
you want to pay me
these are not rebels look at them

the captain laughs snatches the gun from paul marches toward them

captain let these people give you some money whatever they have
the captain hesitates
paul sees this runs over to the line of neighbors

a pathetic rain of rwandan francs useless coins watches jewelry falls onto the ground
paul scoops it all up
he captain looks at it takes it then there is only enough for one cockroach
the captain raises his pistol

now each terrified neighbor looks to paul begging
paul counts the kneeling figures ten adults four kids
and four children

the captain points the gun

paul finds his room and opens the door

paul paces the room
the maids clearly havent cleaned it since its last occupants the beds are unmade towels are on the floor and a newspaper is scattered across the desk

garindi climbs back into his car
paul stops just shy of the lobby
around the corner is a mob of angry guests
paul takes a moment to gather himself straightens his tie button his jacket flick a piece of lint from his shoulder
then he takes a breath and steps around the corner
thank you for your patience ladies and gentlemen

the mob rushes him
paul works the front desk as angry guests surge all around him
zozo emerges from the office with two tourists
where are the receptionists

close on a door with a placard reading presidential suite
the door opens
gregoire answers half naked

gregoire closes the door
pauls eyes burn with anger but this battle will have to wait
paul comes into the lobby and discovers colonel oliver he is escorting a tall well dressed man the tutsi minister of finance xavier and his family
paul you know who this is

paul studies the group a ragged bunch no way are they mille collines guest material
please sir we have nowhere else to go

i said everyone go over there
paul sees un colonel oliver giving an interview to the bbc in front of the hotel
paul approaches the bbc reporter gloria and colonel oliver as their interview concludes
do we know who fired the missile that killed the president
but i fear its intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the hutu militia and the tutsi rebels
weve heard reports of reprisal killings
will the un intervene to stop the bloodshed
unfortunately were here as peace keepers not peace makers we cant take an aggressive role
if the un changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed
with some re inforcements im confident we could impose order
have you requested re enforcements
yes we have
what was the response
were awaiting a decision excuse me
colonel oliver shakes glorias hand then moves off toward paul
paul ive sent my soldiers to rescue the lady prime minister shell need a room
yes sir but these people points they cannot stay here
ive heard you have a refugee center at the airport stadium
im sorry i cant possibly take them paul
im overrun with refugees
as soon as we can stabilize the situation well take them
paul moves to the door where jock and gloria argue beside a saloon car with the word press spelt out in tape on the wind sreen for fucks sake gloria
theres a big news story out there
we need to get out and cover it
were not going outside the hotel grounds unless we have an armored car
thats the ground rules
where the fuck do you think you are wimbledon
we cover the story from here until we can get proper protection
she walks off
paul works his way through the crowds in the lobby sees a trolley of dishes by an elevator looks around cant see any staff
disgusted he pushes the trolley himself
paul pushes the trolley into the deserted kitchen
at the back door several cooks listen to the radio
good hutus we must destroy an infestation of cockroaches at the technical college
turn that off
we have a hotel to run
the cooks halfheartedly slouch back to the sinks
the lobby is overflowing with refugees
paul stands with phone to ear
zozo walks up
to zozo wheres housekeeping
they wont pick up
sir no one wants to work
they say the boss has left
paul heads for the back office
a neat corporate office
paul picks up the phone
several executive officers sit across from sabena president godefroid around a speaker phone
can i have your name again
paul rusesabagina mr
the house manager
i met you on your last visit
yes paul i remember
the mille collines is a very important property for sabena
our directors believe we should close down shutter the place until this unrest is over
this is really bad news
paul cant allow them to close
sir that would be very bad for our reputation
we are an oasis of calm for all our loyal customers
what would they think if sabena deserted them now
lies i assure you the united nations has everything under control
he looks at the others
but if this thing gets worse we must close
if theres anything you need call anytime
there is one thing i need right away
paul waits by the fax then it spits out a single page
every member of the hotel staff is gathered together
paul addresses them as zozo hands out copies of a fax
this is my letter of appointment signed by mr
godefroid the president of sabena
the mille collines is a five star establishment we will run it that way
if you dont want to work for me then leave now
no one moves
i want the hallways cleaned now a menu prepared for the dining room
wheres the pianist
a hand goes up
i want you on the piano in the kigali room tonight
back to work
paul emerges to find more refugees some settled on the lawn others gathered in clumps by the doorway
paul calls over to the valet
take these people to the rear car park they cant stay here
suddenly women and children on the lawn scream and run in fear
behind them bushes shake then suddenly a bloody figure wearing only boxer shorts bursts out from among the trees and flees to the middle of the driveway
its the journalist benedict covered in blood
his ear has been chopped off
as paul runs to him calls to zozo
paul grabs benedict tries to calm him
theyre killing everyone
the lady minister
the un soldiers
theyre at the gate
he points down the driveway
this sparks many of the women refugees and white guests to flee inside the hotel
odette arrives with her bag leads benedict inside
jock has been filming all of this
now jock runs camera still on his shoulder toward the gate
paul takes off after him
more tutsi refugees running up the driveway in fear
as jock films paul arrives by the gate house
un soldiers watch the outside road
engines roar then
a convoy of toyota trucks circle on the road outside the gate
drunken militia men on the back wave spears machetes one in a womans disco wig waves a cordless power drill
the drill bit is red with blood
in the next truck two militia men triumphantly taunt the un soldiers as they hold blue un helmets high on sticks
the helmets are shot through with holes
we kill un
we kill you next
enraged un soldiers cock their weapons aim
a un armored car races past the militia and turns into the driveway
the back door opens un colonel oliver jumps out
hold the line here

the colonel stabilizes the situation his men watch the militia drive by
paul approaches oliver
they murdered my soldiers

oliver shakes his head
he helps paul clamber into the armored car
paul follows oliver as he marches through the lobby
several reporters surround them

paul watches the un command disappear into an elevator
paul is in the corridor talking to tatiana
has roger spoken yet
no odette says hes in shock
how can we help him
he needs to be in a safe place
a beat have you heard from mr
give him time
theres a clank of metal
paul looks and sees a waiter struggling with a trolley of food by a door
he hurries to help the waiter as jock opens indicates quiet waves paul and the waiter in
the room is set up as a make shift broadcast center
gloria is on a phone to the bbc in london she hangs up
okay were feeding through live now
she fixes her outfit sits straight up in the chair
behind her two monitors show footage of a plane crash and bodies along roads
and five four three two one
thats correct tom
todays gruesome ambush of a ten man belgian patrol has left the un peacekeeping force in a state of disarray
its commander has called for re enforcements
however the general council is deeply divided
the united states still smarting from the uns disastrous somalia mission has indicated that it will veto any moves to reinforce
meanwhile the slaughter goes on
gloria brooks in kigali rwanda
gloria on the phone listens

jock turns to paul

jock points skyward

the news room has heard that the french and the belgians are putting together an intervention force
when will they be here
jocks is at the window scanning with his camera getting b roll then he sees something
hey peter hook me back into the monitors
jocks filming as peter makes the connection
what is it
jock focuses on the monitor blurry focus of a shanty town on a hill
now focus of a crowd hovering close to a group of rwandan tutsis seated on the ground
two militia emerge from the crowd waving machetes
they slash their way along the line savage powerful blows butchering people like cattle
author note we will use real news footage of this you fucking see that

on screen the crowd run off waving machetes
gloria snaps out of her shock snatches the phone dials

she puts the phone down turns to the others triumphant
an embarrassed silence in the room
jock is disgusted by her glee
he picks up a plate from the trolley
to gloria here have a sandwich
she storms out
paul fills the embarrassed silence
im glad you filmed this
now the west will have to stop it
excuse me gentlemen
the businessman mr
garindi knocks on room
paul opens the door sees him then turns back to tatiana
tatsi appears at the door with several of the kids
to the kids go back inside
the kids do as theyre told
paul and tatsi shut the door and join the businessman in the hall

tatiana clings to paul fearful of the news
i made it to the house but it was empty
it had been robbed
was there blood
as i left a neighbor an old woman waved to me
i went to her house
she has the little girls
they are safe
my brother his wife
did this woman know of them
did they leave the children with her
the businessman shakes his head no
tears run down tatianas face
she holds pauls arm to stop from falling to the floor
this is not bad news tatsi
perhaps they fled or could not make it home
there is hope
to the businessman please go back bring the children to us
frightened no maam i cannot do that
the roadblocks are everywhere

tatiana pulls paul to her
my sister is dead paul
they would not leave the children

paul and tatiana push through the french tourists and aid workers running across the lobby
mon dieu merci
cheers break out
paul and tatsi peer from the crowd and through the lobby window see french and italian special forces pull into the parking lot standing tall in their jeeps macho western
super troops triumphant
wild cheering flowers draped around necks kisses
westerners rwandans dance and sing in celebration
paul sees colonel oliver off to the side with the commanders of the french special forces
you have a battalion you could stop this now
the hutu army is no match for you
those are not our orders
oliver pulls off his blue beret throws it on the ground points his finger at the french and italian officers
you will remember this day for the rest of your lives
he walks off returns picks up his beret
paul watches as he storms into the lobby
paul follows the colonel into the kigali club
the place is empty the bartender missing gone to celebrate
colonel what can i get you
paul gets behind the bar
oliver cracks a weary smile
paul pours two drinks slides one across
he raises his glass
you have saved us all

colonel oliver says the un has three hundred soldiers for the whole country
black soldiers pakistanis
he looks up at her
the most the colonel can spare for the hotel are four men and theyre not allowed to shoot
he takes her hand makes her sit down
if anything should happen if the militia arrive you must take the children and go to the roof
tatianas eyes are wide with fear
paul takes his anger out on tatiana
do what i say woman

i will meet you there
he storms out
reveal a chaos of luggage white tourists aid agency people italian and french soldiers elite slick
on the edges clumps of rwandans watching silent fearful
a torrential african rain storm soaks everything
porters with big umbrellas run the white evacuees to the buses
french and italian commanders check off names on clipboards
jock films the evacuees boarding buses
at the front desk paul dripping wet from working the convoy listens to a french tourist who refuses to pay his bill
why should i pay to stay in a in a holocaust
paul stone faced polite destroys this asshole
you are not staying sir you are leaving
paul watches in the rain as the final agency people are being loaded onto buses
several white aid workers weep uncontrollably as they are dragged away from frightened rwandan coworkers
paul in the rain
cross the parking lot colonel oliver watches from his jeep
jock and his sound man embrace two beautiful young hookers
one girl begs jock to take her with him
please please they will put me on the street
they will chop me
darlin believe me if i could
he digs in his pockets pulls out money cigarettes
everything he has he gives to her

jock embraces paul tears in his eyes
gloria watches from the doorway
embarrassed by jock she becomes officious

gloria marches onto the bus
to a french soldier what are we waiting for
we have to evacuate some nuns from a convent
they are on their way
jock kisses the hooker heaves his camera onto the bus
then there is a disturbance on the driveway
a group of french nuns along with maybe a hundred tutsi women and children come running up the driveway
they are all terrified
one nun leads them with a french flag
french soldiers run forward
a commander orders them to form a line blocking the refugees
french soldiers begin pulling nuns from the terrified crowd
several nuns begin hysterically weeping pulling rwandan children with them
panic breaks out among the crowd
jock grabs his camera pushes off the bus
nuns cling to young children
french soldiers wrench the nuns away lift them off their feet carry them to the bus
jock films as a french officer screams at him
the last nun is dragged onto a bus
jock looks to paul then gets on the bus
the convoy french jeeps buses italian jeeps un jeeps takes off through the refugees turns a corner gone
paul drenched is left alone to fend for his new guests weeping women frightened children
the convoy passes the gate house
across the road two jeeps of rwandan army soldiers watch the convoy leave
they get on the radio
where five minutes before the lobby was a frenzy of wealthy europeans and aid workers the groups of clustered black faces are silent except for the crying of babies and
paul picks his way among them
zozo catches up
what do we do with all these people
open up the ballroom well put them there
and zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans a lot of it
paul enters drops to the bed
tatiana curls up next to him
you could leave paul
what are you saying tatsi
your card says hutu
take our children go and get the twins pay money at the roadblocks
get them out
enough of this
we stay together
let me rest i will feel better then
paul puts on his walkman earphones presses play the rich cowboy drawl of don williams singing
close on paul as his eyes droop and to the music
a kalidiscope of colors filter through drooping eyelids as close on pauls face as the music plays
his eyes open wide disturbed music playing pauls pov an army lieutenant stands over him other soldiers around
the lieutenant reaches down pulls the earphones from pauls ears
you are the manager
what is wrong
everyone must leave the hotel now
its an order

please give us twenty thirty minutes
people are sleeping
the lieutenant is not impressed
please have some cold drinks
i will be as quick as i can
cold drinks softens the soldiers attitudes
we will be outside ten minutes
the soldiers march off
paul goes back inside
the kids sensing the menace sit still and wide eyed on the floor
suddenly tatiana notices roger is missing
danielle points to under the bed
roger trembling under the bed as pauls face appears
come on son everything is all right
he slides him out clutches him in his arms then turns him over to tatiana as he phones the front desk
on phone who is this
get them beer
he turns to tatiana
go to the roof now
terrified what for paul
forceful do as i say
i will be there soon
he hurries out
pauls door opens his head appears round the corner
the corridor is empty of soldiers
now frightened tutsis peer out from their rooms
a group of men among them the politician xavier are gathered in the hallway
paul spots one man holding a pistol
he runs up
to the man with the pistol are you mad
they will gun us all down
better to die by the bullet than the machete
paul pulls the gun off him
wait here please
paul hands the gun to xavier hurries off
paul bursts in sits by the phone and dials
good day general bizimungu please
do you know where he is
please ask him to call paul rusesabagina
it is urgent
a series of flash cuts increasingly frantic calls
can you find him
who would order such a thing
did you find the general
paul hangs up the phone defeated
he looks at his watch
his head flops onto the desk onto the sabena logo
he sees it
the sabena president and two vps sit on couches

you have been good to me and my family
panicked paul wait wait im going to put you on hold for one minute stay on the phone
he hits the hold button
looks to the other executives
they are stunned to silence by pauls profound farewell
paul listens to music on the phone
pandemonium the president has everyone working the phones

louis get the un
tell them this is belgian property
the music is suddenly interrupted
paul are you there
yes thank you mr
paul if you have one call in all the world to stop this who would you call

i will call you back
paul hurries from the room
zozo at the computer printing something
paul walks up sees the hotels registry printing
paul grabs it studies
what are you doing
the lieutenant wants the register
he pushes zozo toward the elevator
go and get more beer
now paul is on the computer typing
on screen the register shows that days date april
paul hits a few keys
on screen the date above the register is april
paul hits the print button
the printer clicks to life
paul with the printed registry and zozo with beer walk to the jeeps
the soldiers dont wait for the captains order they mob zozo grab beers
the lieutenant marches up to paul
wheres the guest list
paul hands him the printout
he studies it reads
anderson arthurs boulier
what is this
the guest list
it hasnt been updated since the murder of the president
the lieutenant grabs paul by the shirt
are you trying to make a fool of me
there are no europeans left in that hotel
get me the names of all the cockroaches in there
that will take time
you dont have time
if i do not have the names so that i can pick out the traitors then i will kill everyone here in this car park
get in there now
paul turns to walk back in
the lieutenant hurries to his men pulls beers from their hands smashes them on the ground
one soldier comes running to him with a radio
the lieutenant listens then calls to paul
hey you come here
who did you call
dont lie to me
whats your name
i will remember that name
turns to his soldiers lets go
the soldiers roar off down the driveway
zozo looks to paul a thank you jesus look
paul emerges onto the roof sees tatiana his children and many of the neighbors sitting huddled together
they do not know the soldiers have left
tatiana is frozen to the spot
they have gone
tatiana grabs him
tears of joy
pauls neighbors swarm him touch him thank him like a messiah
this effects him
he seems genuinely moved as he shakes hands and hugs them
the president of sabena is on the phone for you
paul arrives behind the front desk
paul hits the button
they are gone
thank you sir
what did you do
gotfroid is at his desk
i managed to get the president of france on the phone
thank you sir you saved our lives
paul i pleaded with the president to go in and get you all
he told me it will not happen
i can give you many political answers paul but the truth is that africa is not worth a single vote to all of them french british americans
you have to get out of there paul
i will do whatever i can
the elite of the tutsi refugees those with contacts or friends abroad are gathered in the office
there will be no rescue no intervention force
we can only save ourselves
call any foreigner you know tell them what will happen to us
say goodbye but when you say goodbye say it as though youre reaching through and shaking their hand
let them know if they let go of that hand you will die
silence we must shame them into sending help
the others look stunned
get on the phones while we still can
at least we can say they heard our cries
zozo come with me
paul looks around the lobby
it resembles a refugee center more than a five star hotel
he turns to a computer calls up the register then hits delete and erases the register
he picks up the phone calls
send two of the housekeeping carpenters to the lobby
paul strides across the lobby calls to zozo
everyone gather together now
zozo get them all together
they herd together quickly
no one can remain in this lobby any longer
i have rooms available
who can pay
the rental is six hundred francs per day
about fifty percent of the hands go up
i cannot pay
go with zozo to the ballroom
we will find you bedding
this is a hotel
no one will be allowed to stay in the lobby
the carpenters arrive beside paul
i want you to go around and take all the numbers off the doors
what shall we put in their place
i want no numbers on the doors
paul going door to door knocking
the rooms are all packed with tutsi refugees
a door opens
here is your bill for the last week
if you cannot pay or think you will not be able to pay go to the ballroom
zozo will take care of you
paul knocks on a door
the tutsi politician xavier opens the door sees that it is paul
come in paul
a beautiful two bedroom suite
xavier lives in comfort compared to the other refugees
im afraid you will have to move room
im going to put you on the third floor
the third floor are low class rooms
yes they are
however if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms
to his wife pack the bags we have to move
also this is your bill for the last week
paul leaves xavier looks shocked
paul and influential refugees odette benedict with a bandage over his missing ear xavier and others call plead write and send faxes all around the world
we see this night and day day and night hen odette on the phone
yes thats right
i helped set up the treatment center in nairobi
im in the mille collines hotel right now with my husband peter and my two boys
if you do not help us we will be murdered
sir general bizimungu is here
the pool patio is deserted except for general bizimungu and three soldiers who lounge at a table
gregoire and his girlfriend sun on reclining deck chairs like movie stars
paul and a waiter with a tray of drinks join the general
i am glad you are well
paul hands the scotch to bizimungu
im sorry it is not glenmorangie
as long as it is scotch
drinks your white friends have abandoned you paul
the united nations are still here
laughs the united nations
madmen are on the streets paul
but i will take care of you
chugs his drink your cellar is well stocked right
i am glad you came by
i overheard something that i think you should know about
what did you overhear
a discussion between an american embassy official and a un colonel
what did they say
the american assured the colonel that they would watch everything
they are gone
paul points surreptitiously to the sky
the general looks up
yes they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder
and what will they do with these satellites
the american said intervention is too costly better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command
the high command
our high command
snatch them up and put on a war crimes trial
lock them all away forever
no political risk and big publicity
thats what he said
a beat i thought id better tell you
the general looks again to the sky then
who are they to put us on trial
let us imagine paul when their president kennedy was shot they said it was a black man
then their politicians their radio stations gave orders we must wipe out these black people before they wipe out us
what do you think would have happened
excuse me momentarily
paul fills bizimungus briefcase with scotch hands two six packs of beer to zozo
paul notes his once packed storeroom now considerably dwindled in stock
where has all our beer gone
sir gregoire has been taking beers
how much beer
paul arrives back at the pool hands bizimungu his briefcase
zozo gives the beer to the soldiers
i am worried about thieves and criminals coming into the hotel
perhaps you could arrange for some police to guard us
the police are very busy
i understand general but when i last talked to the president of sabena he promised me that anyone who helped protect belgian property would be rewarded
bizimungu understands this is a financial proposition
well rewarded those were his words
if i were to spare a few policemen where would i station them
the front gate would be best general
they could check all guests
i will see what i can do
i admire you general
how do you keep command of your men amidst such madness
i am strong paul like a lion
i wish i were like you
look at my staff they wont work they listen to no one
paul nods over toward gregoire
he is staff
he general gets up
gregoire who is lying face down on the deck chair doesnt see him approach
the general pulls the deck chair from underneath gregoire and throws it into the pool
as gregoire tries to scramble to his feet the general propels him forward with a massive kick up the ass
get to work you slug
gregoire races from the pool followed by his girlfriend
the general clicks his fingers and his soldiers follow
make sure paul your guests are generous
benedict greets paul in the lobby
paul we would like to speak to you in your office
we who is we
paul walks in and discovers the office packed with the elite tutsi refugees including xavier odette and jean baptiste
pauls puzzled theres an air of tension in the room
a brief silence then a tutsi bank manager speaks
you have no right to charge us rent
this is no longer a hotel it is a prison and you are profiteering from our misery
that is not true
another accuser speaks up
yes it is
he charges for food for everything
where is all this money going
we hear he has a deal with bizimungu
it is said that you work for the murderer george rutagunda
murmurs of agreement
paul has heard enough
a beat its true i have a deal with general bizimungu
he was just here
i worked out another money making scheme for him
new arrivals will be taxed at the gate
do you know what my deal is with bizimungu
i pay him and he keeps you alive
anyone want to take their money back
paul pulls money from his pocket hands it around offers it
here here take it
and you dont have to pay your bill
i will move you into the ballroom or out into the gardens
he walks among them
and yes i work with george rutagunda
i buy rice and beans beer and soap
i will have to visit his warehouse soon because we are running out of food
who wants to come with me
paul holds the door open
anyone who wants to come with me stay behind
if not please leave
they hurry out duly chastised
but odette and her husband jean baptiste remain
laughs you are most certainly not coming with me
you will get me killed
you cant go to that place they know what you are doing here
george will not hurt me i am too profitable to him
what if he is not there
paul hasnt got an answer for that one
he leads them out
roger is asleep on a couch in the living room several kids sleep on the floor
to the bed where tatiana suppresses bursts of laughter as paul relates the gregoire story in whispers
as soon as the general left he came running back
mimics gregoire help me sir i have been possessed by a witch
pauls own voice now a witch you say
mimics yes yes i did not know i was in that room
the presidents room why would i be in the presidents room
own voice indeed the general asked me the same
mimics asked you what
own voice does gregoire think he is president now
paul mimics gregoires whimpers of fear
laughing stop stop we will waken the children
paul lifts the bottle of fine bordeaux pours more
perfect with lamb or fine rare beef
so where is the lamb
maybe gregoire and the witch ate it
they both chuckle then paul remembers a cloud of anxiety comes over him
whats the matter
were running out of beer and other supplies
she kisses him
the foreigners abandon us and you do inventory
you are so conscientious
she kisses him again tries to cheer him
i have to go out to get food
to rutagundas place
it is close by
i have to tatiana we are only as valuable as the service we provide
you cannot go alone
im not going alone
ill take gregoire with me
hes a good hutu and he wants to impress me now
the lobby is deserted except for gregoire now neatly dressed
regoire it is good to see you back to work
please except my humblest apologies
i have a job this morning
i must go to visit my good friend george rutagunda
you know george
gregoire nods impressed
fetch the van
a thick mist blankets the grounds as paul and gregoire emerge
fearful where are we going sir
for supplies you drive
the fog is too heavy sir
just drive gregoire
they pass the gate the policemen are asleep in the box
the van passes along the deserted main road past a wrecked car over broken glass the fog swirls around them
then gregoire hits the brakes
in front of them a makeshift barricade long poles stretched across two oil drums
they wait for someone to appear from the fog no one
we should go back sir
paul wants to agree but cant
he opens his door
paul gets out tentative
he moves to the barrier lifts the pole places it on the ground hurries back to the van
they drive past the barricade
the van weaves through the fog enshrouded streets
hey slow to check road signs in the fog on one a womans dress shredded and soaked in blood is draped like a banner
the fog still hangs like a cloud
as they pull up a group of young militia emerge from toyota trucks
what do you want
we are to meet mr
the commander is not here
he will be here
show me your id paul and gregoire hand over their id cards
the militia man studies them then pockets the cards
our cards please
you have our cards
but i make cards
would you like me to make you two cards
one thousand francs
then from out of the fog three toyota trucks roar up
george rutagunda heavily armed in cut off shorts and an open shirt his barrel chest laden with bandoliers jumps out
he militia man pulls out the id cards hands them back
rutagunda strides over
my old friend
paul climbs out greets george as a militia man swings open the doors of the warehouse
they walk in
the warehouse is filled with looted televisions artwork cars
george points to the stacks of beer
everything is double the price now you do understand that
i need rice beans beer and your best whiskey
g beer yes but no whiskey
you have no whiskey
no whiskey no spirits
your rich cockroaches at the hotel they will have to do without their scotch
anyway i have bled that cow enough paul
paul counts out the rwandan francs
what do you mean george
their money is no good to them
soon all the ineysi will be dead
incredulous you cannot kill them all
we are half way there already
pauls stomach heaves
he hides it turns over the money gets in the van with gregoire
george comes to the passenger window
let me give you a tip my friend our generals in the army say do not go near the mille collines or they will send the belgian soldiers back here
but the generals are about to leave and we will be in charge
it is time to butcher your cow for the meat
a beat you can help us paul
you have some very important traitors at your hotel
the politician xavier
the liar benedict
if we were to get them then maybe we could let one or two cockroaches get away
you understand paul
paul says nothing but gregoire has been listening very carefully
take the river road back
it is clear
the van takes off
the fog has gotten thicker
they can barely see a yard ahead
are you sure this is the river road
i saw the sign
the van begins to bump erratically
bump bump bump
youve driven off the road
youll put us in the river
the van jerks to a halt
paul clambers out stumbles falls
and discovers hes looking at the face of a dead child a young tutsi girl her hands clasped on her ears as though to block the sound of her own
death an african munzs scream
paul clambers to his feet sees that the van is on a road littered with dead bodies men women children
he bumps were dead bodies the van has driven over them
a breeze from the lake blows the fog clear for thirty feet
revealing a carpet of bodies hundreds of them sprawled all along the road as far as paul can see
paul wanders stunned among misshapen corpses made more ghostly by wisps of fog
finally paul clambers shell shocked back into the van
gregoire throws the van into reverse
hey bump back over the carpet of bodies each shake and crunch another horror
the van pulls up at the rear suppliers entrance
paul hops out turns to gregoire
tell no one what you saw do you understand
gregoire zozo and the porters begin unloading the van
paul wanders to a bench set back in a manicured grove of bushes
beyond him a crowd of rwandan refugee children play in the swimming pool laughing jumping splashing like they were at a municipal pool in central park
tears stream from his eyes the stream grows into a flood he buries his face in his hands
then a voice
paul wipes his eyes turns
a little boy stands behind him holding out his arm
then paul sees what is wrong
the boy has a big thorn imbedded in the muscle of his arm
paul studies it
thats a big one
pinches the thorn here we go
paul pulls on the thorn the kid doesnt flinch
paul picks him up carries him to the pool throws him in
tatiana feeds the children rice and beans
good evening papa
roger you have no greeting for me
roger tries to speak struggles to mouth the words but nothing comes out as though he has forgotten
tears form in his eyes
there do not worry no tears
he hugs him puts him back at his food then takes tatianas hand leads her to the door
whispers where are we going
they slip out
please paul why do we have to go to the roof
this is the only place i can find some peace
paul slips out onto the roof
artillery and mortar fire rumble in the distance
flashes silhouette along the far hills above kigali
he leads her to a blanket a candle two glasses and the bottle of wine
he opens the wine
laughs i hear we must pay for everything
how much for this
you are a very good man paul rusesabagina
he kisses him again
i have a confession
when we met
yes when you worked as the nurse
i had you transferred to kigali
i bribed the minister of health to have you transferred to kigali
to be closer
so that i could marry you
what was the bribe
silence what am i worth to you
it was substantial
tell me what it was
what sort of car
what does it matter
i want to know
he slaps him playfully
i hope it was a new volkswagen
she kisses him they lie back on the roof kiss passionately
paul instructs the porters to clean around the entrance
the un armored car comes up the driveway
colonel oliver gets out strides across the tarmac he shakes pauls hand
great news paul were going to get you out of here
the sweetest words paul has ever heard
oliver is on the stage all the refugee guests are crowded into the room he has a list in his hand
the un has been notified that the following families have received travel visas from the following countries
abukesu tanzania arumangu zambia bawroanga kenya close on elation among the chosen families
gituaranga zambi horangora belguim close on fear on the faces of families who realize they have missed this alphabetical list anxiety among the others
paramisambi zambia rusesabagina belgium
tatiana kisses paul
a plane will land at the airport tomorrow and the named families will be flown to kenya
two un trucks will be here at a
the named families must be ready to leave then
voice calls out
why not take us all to the airport
we can wait there to obtain visas
i cant do that
our camp at the airport is overwhelmed already
we could not defend you there
you are better to stay here and work to get an exit visa
oliver jumps from the stage pushes through the crowd
pauls pov odette and jean baptiste are silently devastated
he pushes through to the colonel now surrounded by those who didnt make the list
colonel odette camundu
she must be on the list
oliver shakes his head no
paul only those i called can get on the trucks
i do not want to have to pull people off you understand
paul nods yes
tatiana arrives beside him pulls him aside
i will not leave without the twins
we have to get out of here tatiana
please please try one more time
ill try but we have to leave with or without them
i want you to promise
she reluctantly nods yes
garindi waits nervously in the lobby
it is dangerous to be here
the radio says this is a nest of cockroaches
i need one last favor
go back and get the twins
emphatic no it is impossible
that side of town has been destroyed in the fighting
the children are dead
how do you know
everyone is dead there
the dogs eat the bodies in the street
i have to go
i will give you my house
the businessman turns back
its a fine house
here is a paper
paul spots an elegant woman carrying laundry toward the elevator
he runs to her
p madame kawunda please
paul leads her over
i need you to witness this signature
to the businessman madame kawunda is the minister for agriculture
she is a very reliable witness
paul signs then hands the pen to the puzzled woman
please witness this deed
paul pushes the deed into the mans hand
there now go and find them
they have no papers
no one knows they are tutsi
they will be alive
the businessman heads for the door
you must be back by a
paul watches him go
paul skirts the little groups of poor families bivouacked on the lawn
the smoke of cooking fires has replaced the tiki lanterns
the grounds are a mini refugee camp
paul joins tatiana odette and jean baptiste who sit at a table by the pool
dont worry paul we will make the next list
zozo arrives with beers serves them is about to leave
tatiana grabs him by the arm
sit with us zozo
no ma am i am too busy
zozo you are family join us
zozo is shocked by this breach of protocol but sits
you are my dearest friends
i promise you before god that i will not sleep until i have you out of here
all of you
he embraces jean baptiste it is good that you are going paul because now we know we have one person who will save us
odette hugs and kisses him
we owe you our lives
paul takes zozo in his arms
you are my family now zozo my brother
i will get you out of here
thank you sir
let us remember this night and tell the world that even in hell there are good people
a unbreakable bond of faith with each other
the lucky families are gathered tatiana and all her children xavier and his wife benedict and others
some of the unlucky ones peer around the door of the ballroom
a un officer stands in their way
only those with letters of acceptance in the lobby
the un convoy waits outside
tatiana waits nervously as paul checks his watch
a little longer paul
we wait until
if he is not here with the twins he is not coming
that was your promise
go help the children
paul is in a horrible mood
the refugees in the ballroom try to push by the un officer
paul joins him
zozo tell those people to get back to the ballroom
they can not be here
zozo scampers off
what are we waiting for
paul herds the convoy people toward the door
close on gregoire watching from behind the front desk
through the doors we see the trucks being loaded
sir the others want to speak to you
reluctant paul walks over to the ballroom dwellers
good sir we have letters please take them for us
paul reaches out for the letters takes them reads the addresses president nelson mandela
pope john paul
if you leave we are certain to die
i have a letter sir
zozo hands paul the letter
he studies the address
it reads to the great man muhammad ali
thers crowd around
i will get you all visas
i will get you out of here
pauls at a loss
he has to tear himself away
fraid to look back he heads for the convoy
the last of the evacuees clamber onto the un trucks
the children are on board but tatiana waits
ask them to wait a little longer
for the twins
get on the truck tatiana
he checks his watch then takes her in his arms
look our children are crying please get on the truck
paul helps tatiana on board
he looks toward the door
pov the unlucky refugees are now crowded at the windows lost souls watching out from their prison at the lucky ones
paul whispers to benedict as he boards
paul clambers on beside him
he reaches tatiana as benedict sits beside her
i have to stay
sit down now
i cannot leave these people
i will wait for the twins
paul backs off
tatiana tries to follow
benedict grabs her
let me off this truck
a commotion as she tries to get up
let me go
children get off
i will follow on the next plane
the truck starts up
paul runs beside it shouts to tatiana
i love you
keep the children safe
then another voice
the convoy takes off down the driveway
paul zozo and other refugees cluster by the door
zozo looks round sees gregoire put a phone down
un colonel oliver sits next to a un pakistani driver
he convoy passes looters and small groups of militia on the road but proceeds unheeded
the room is still littered with clothes kids drawings the personal junk accumulated over four weeks
paul tries to arrange things then collapses on the bed paralysed with doubt why did he do this
then the door bangs
boss sir quick please come quick
the door springs open paul confronts zozo
breathless sir the radio you must hear it is on the radio
paul and zozo burst into the kitchen
the cooks and others are clustered listening to the radio
block the roads to the airport
the cockroaches from the mille collines are escaping
the liar benedict the traitor rusesabaginas cockroaches
stop them now at rue don bosco
thirty thousand francs for the head of xavier
dear lord how did they know
i saw gregoire make a call sir
as the trucks go
paul bursts out of the kitchen enraged
gregoire is at the front desk
sees paul understands instantly
gregoire takes off running for his life
paul chases after him through the door
gregoire disappears into the thicket of trees
paul after him
through the trees
gregoire younger faster climbs the high wire fence
finally paul reaches the fence
sees gregoire escape into the bushes on the other side of the fence
paul gives up turns back toward the hotel
as the un jeep turns a bend colonel oliver sees crowds of interahamwe swarming from beside houses from gardens
they pull burning tires old furniture junk onto the road
the un truck suddenly lurches then slows
the refugees from the mille collines grow alarmed
paul is on the fax phone begging
please general i will give you money whiskey
you said you had no whiskey
please i have money
theyre driving into an ambush its on the radio
swarms of crazed militia fill the road
gun fire breaks out
colonel oliver steps from the jeep waving his pistol in the air
ilitia men swarm around him push past to the truck
machete slashes through the canvas
hildren scream hands grab at people
benedict is hauled off the truck
tatiana protects her kids in a corner kicking at the hands that grab for her
on the street xavier falls to the ground
screams shouts more shots
oliver fights his way through to xavier
oliver points his pistol
the crowd backs off slightly
xavier gets to his feet
bang more gun fire
immaculata falls wounded in the foot
more are dragged from the trucks
machetes flash in the sun
then horns gunfire rwandan soldiers drive through the crowd in two jeeps
the crowd scatters then re forms as rwandan soldiers push between the militia and the refugees
as they do another militia gunman steps out fires wildly at the refugees but wounds a rwandan soldier in the stomach
suddenly fights erupt between the militia and the soldiers
paul paces up and down he can hear gunfire in the distance
paul jumps in the van guns the engine drives
pauls van speeds toward the gate
as a un jeep its tires shot out sparks cascading from wheel rims screams up to the guard house
paul slams on the brakes
the jeep is followed by the two trucks their canvas slashed fluttering in the wind
paul throws the van into reverse and clears the way
the convoy pulls up in front of the hotel
bloody and battered the terrified refugees fall from the trucks
paul and odette run among the casualties
then he sees them tatiana clothes torn scratches on her face
the kids screaming in terror
paul runs to them grabs kisses weeps louder
battered refugees everywhere other hotel residents looking on equally terrified because they know they are doomed
paul sees roger trembling tears soak his face
he grabs roger up
tatiana struggles to paul embraces
thank god you are safe
tatiana breaks from the embrace
did he bring the twins
paul shakes his head no
paul sits alone on his secluded bench in the garden
cloud of despair shrouds him
as he watches several women dip cooking pots into the pool
e hurries toward them
what are you doing
p there is no water from the pipes
paul heads for the front doors
hes intercepted by the two rwandan policemen stationed at the gate by bizimungu
here is our beer
you promised us beer
did you explain to the good general that i have temporarily run out of stock
he said to ask mitterand and the french to send you more
you will get it in due time
now please get back to the gate
paul enters sees zozo
what is this about no water
its true sir the water has been turned off
odette benedict watch cnn on the tv
paul shakes his head in disbelief
we can still get cnn here in hell
a state department woman gives a press conference
the americans are talking about us
from the reports we have received from rwanda it appears that acts of genocide have been committed
excuse me how many acts of genocide does it take to declare this a genocide
i ahh there is ahh we have terminology that has been
you havent answered the question
how many acts of genocide before your government will declare this a genocide
im not prepared to nor am i able
everyone in the room is dumbfounded
then benedict begins laughing a maniacal laugh then he bangs on his chest and hoots like a chimpanzee
ive got it
i have the answer
they all stare as he begins beating his chest and hopping about like an ape
we must become mountain gorillas
then they can put us on the endangered species list
come on try it
they think were halfway there already
benedict hops up onto a desk
the door flies open
its general bizimungu
he surveys the room then points at paul
bizimungu looks terrible an alcoholic suffering d
where are my supplies
im sorry general
the cellar is empty
you have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty
did they drink my whiskey
we have no way of finding other stock but i have money for you from the guests
paul pulls a bundle of notes hands them to the general
they are only good now for wiping your ass
there is nothing more i can do for you people
youre on your own
the general storms off
paul walks through the lobby
he carries an ash tray to a trash can the futile task of a dedicated hotel manager on auto pilot
he sees a un jeep pull up outside
paul meets the un soldiers they are the four ghanians who guard the gate
they look frightened
the policemen have gone
i ran out of whiskey
please go down and guard us
then roar of an engine and the crash of splintering wood
as a battered toyota pickup appears it races up the driveway
the truck drags the wooden gatehouse on a rope behind
crazed militia pack the bed of the pickup
bang bang bang
a militia man fires a pistol into the air
the tutsi refugees camped on the lawn flee in panic as the militia truck speeds around the driveway
the militia taunt and yell at the tutsi refugees
the truck does a screeching turn and heads back down the driveway leaving a trail of splintered wood
get down there and stop them please
now the ghanians are really frightened
get down and stop them
you know we cannot shoot
what do you mean you cannot shoot
we are peacekeepers it is not in our mandate to shoot
then go and pretend you are soldiers
paul and tatiana pass the clusters of families around their cooking fires
they pass the pool now just a third full
he sits her on the bench in the grove
we are almost out of water
we are almost out of everything
he takes her hand
we had a good life you and i
i want to make our peace
to thank god for the time we had
he kisses her total love
we have to have a plan

our children cannot see us die first
if the militia comes you must hurry up to the roof
i will meet you there
please do not talk like this
we have to
if i do not come you must take them all by the hands and jump
she puts her hands to her ears
he pulls them down
the machete is no way to die
promise me you will do it
she cries harder and squeezes his hand in fear
uddenly a bang from behind them and then above their heads a trail of fire an rpg rocket zigzags toward the hotel
a huge explosion on the wall one story beneath the roof
paul throws tatiana to the ground covers her
moke and concrete dust fall around them

tatiana is beside him
he opens the envelope finds his makeshift house deed and a note

bizimungus jeeps arrives at the hotel
paul greets him

your police are at the gate
after the diplomat
paul clambers in the back
the jeep turns away from the mille collines front gate
they travel at high speed along the road
then the driver sounds his horn because
paul sees a large crowd of militia marching along the road toward the hotel waving machetes and sticks
where are they going
they can go where they want
they are in charge now
what do you mean general
we have decided to move the government to gitarama
paul arrives into the lobby of the diplomat
looters have stripped the place bare
the convoy pulls up
general bizimungu stands with his pistol out
the looters see him and disperse
paul enters the managers office followed by the general
it has been stripped clean except for the safe which is pock marked with bullet strikes
lose on paul he sees a big problem
the dial is damaged

paul goes to the safe and turns the dials tries the handle nothing
it is incredibly hot and paul is soaked with nervous perspiration he takes off his jacket
it might be damaged general
bizimungus look says it better not be for your sake
paul starts again turns the dials more carefully tries and opens the safe door
he pulls it open sees six bottles of glenfiddich four bottles of vsop brandy
bizimungu is joyous as paul hands him a bottle bizimungu sits on a window ledge takes a swig

desperate forceful listen you need me
you are a marked man
the americans and the un they have you as a war criminal
you are on a list

when the europeans left their soldiers gathered lists
bizimungu grabs paul
if you do not help me you will stay on that list
i committed no war crimes
who will tell them
you need me to tell how you helped the hotel
the others who have gone they blame you for all their misfortune
they say you led the massacres
nervous now i led no massacres

you will tell them the truth
defiant i will do nothing unless you help me now
bizimungu reaches for his pistol
what are you going to do shoot me
it will be a blessing
go ahead shoot
i will pay you to shoot my family
you can do nothing to me
bizimungu jumps up grabs paul pulls him
you will tell them i did nothing
paul and bizimungu rush out to the jeeps
paul almost overcome with anxiety
militia swarm around the front of the hotel
the jeeps race through scattering them
they screech to a halt
several refugees sit huddled and battered
bizimungu jumps out snatches an a
from a soldier fires in the air
to his soldiers get them out of here
paul does not wait
paul races into the hotel past frightened refugees who flee
then paul sees a face he recognizes
its gregoire with the militia
paul ducks into the stairway
he leaps the stairs four at a time
he makes it to the third floor pushing past frightened refugees who race down the stairs
he runs straight into a bunch of young militia
show us rusesabagina
they shove paul along the corridor
show us the manager
he wears a suit
they have him in the lobby go quickly
the killers race off
paul gets to his feet and runs
paul bursts in
the place is a mess
and its empty
oh god please lord
he careens out of the room
and sees gregoire coming with a group of militia
they charge toward paul
then a roar of gunfire
the ceiling and walls around gregoire explode
general bizimungus men run up with weapons drawn
get out or ill shoot you
paul rushes to the stairs
more gunfire echoes soldiers clearing the militia
at the stairs paul races upward falls pushes past others struggling to get down
at the roof now there are clumps of refugees who have fled up there including xavier who huddles in a corner
have you seen tatiana
paul runs to the edge of the roof looks over
sees bodies women and children still on the ground beneath by a row of hedge
screams in agony the bodies move look up its not them
its refugees hiding
paul delirious with fear runs along the parapet
below he sees soldiers herding the militia
he runs back to the stairs
inside the staircase he jumps four stairs at a time
inside the corridor soldiers are chasing off the militia
to his room paul staggers in crazed with fear
he looks under the bed
into the bathroom empty
hes about to run out again sees the connecting door to the adjoining hotel room is slightly open
into the adjoining room its empty then a whimper
from the bathroom he moves in cautious
in the bathroom nothing
he moves over pulls back the shower curtain
reveals a cluster of women and children the older ones holding hands over the mouths of the younger ones
and there at the back tatiana and his kids
its alright theyre gone
tears hugs women tremble
the grey of dawn before the sunrise
colonel oliver in his jeep leads a convoy of un trucks past the guard house and bizimungus police and up the drive
parked in front of the hotel
tutsi refugees file up and are helped on board by un soldiers
paul helps tatiana and the children onto a truck
an argument breaks out towards the back of the convoy
paul rushes toward xavier and benedict who argue
they should go one truck at a time
when the first truck gets through to the airport then the others will follow
we cant wait
we all go together or not at all
paul takes matters into his own hands
he locks the doors of the hotel
there is no going back
it is time to leave
the mille collines is closed
paul climbs onto the truck
the others follow some reluctantly
colonel oliver gives the signal
the trucks take off down the driveway
paul now at the front of the truck watches out through a slice in the canvas
sees the convoy pull out of the mille collines
they travel along the road
turn a corner and the truck slows
paul sees a great mass of hutus fill the road militia kids soldiers discarding uniforms
no longer a mob but a crush of hutu refugees now fleeing toward them fleeing the advancing of the rebel army
a crowd of militia men wave their arms shout at the trucks
the driver reluctantly speeds up
a break in the mass of hutu refugees
then gun fire ahead
children begin crying it becomes infectious spreading to pauls children some of the women
then ahead a gang of militia men break from the bushes beside the road
theyre running fast toward the truck some carry rifles
theres more gunfire behind
the militia are almost upon them now
colonel oliver has his pistol drawn
the militia are at the truck
but they run straight past
as a platoon of tutsi rebel soldiers in bush camouflage and red and blue headbands burst from the brush
pursuing careful professional
its the rebels
the crying stops
weve made it
cheering breaks out
children frightened again by the sudden euphoria break into cries of joy
a rebel soldier waves his ak in the air
the trucks crawl into the chaos of the stadium a mass of refugees the wounded lost children abandoned old people hundreds crammed together
paul tatiana and the others clamber off the trucks
they hug cry an outpouring of relief
then tatiana spots someone among the crowds
she rushes over
have you seen my sister fedens
heads shak no
tatiana moves on more frantic pushing through the crowds
two little girls twins an old woman had them
more nos now shes desperate pushing tripping through the crowds and around her we see others doing the same then mama mama
he reaches her pulls at her dress
she takes his hand
no mama look
and sees paul carrying the twins in his arms
she squeals with joy runs to him snatches one from his arms
oh my babies

in tatsis arms and im anais
their laughter mix with tears of joy among the crushing mass of survivors
