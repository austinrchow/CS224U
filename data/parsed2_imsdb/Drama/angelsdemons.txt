written by akiva goldsman april close on an ornate ring
its intricately carved with a seal an image of st
peter casting a net
the ring is carried on a satin pillow through a darkened regal apartment
in the distance bells are tolling the slow solemn tones that announce a death
a dozen men in scarlet cassocks roman catholic cardinals bend down to inspect the ring nodding in affirmation part of an ancient ritual
a younger man the camerlengo in a black cassock takes a silver knife and scratches the rings seal twice once horizontally and once vertically in the sign of the cross
now the ring is placed on a lead block
the camerlengo raises a silver mallet and smashes it down shattering the ring into a thousand tiny pieces
as the cardinals confirm to their satisfaction that the ring has been destroyed the hushed voice of a news reporter comes over the image
the ring of the fisherman which bears the official papal seal and by vatican law must be destroyed immediately following the popes death
the cardinals file out in a solemn procession
behind them the camerlengo closes and locks the doors to the apartment entrance helped by an aide who stretches red silk across the doors in the form of an x
the popes chamberlain or camerlengo then seals the papal apartments at the juncture point of the doors the camerlengo places a glob of hot wax then raises a seal and
burns it into the wax with a hot sizzle
two swiss guardsmen traditionally attired step in front of the doors their eight foot swords held in a low cross
contd and swiss guard will remain posted outside the doors for at least nine days of mourning a period known as tempe sede vacante or
peters basilica we move in toward an empty chair a chair so magnificent it can only be called a throne
the time of the empty throne
a ring appears around the empty throne and a ring as ornate in its way as the ring of the fisherman except this one is a mass of technological sophistication
its twenty five feet across covered with wires sensors gizmos
its the centerpiece of a massive laboratory the size of a football field
scientists and technicians read off checklists in a variety of languages none of them english so far
the place is a hive of activity and sound cooling water whooshes through pipes the static hum of high levels of current floats in the air
vittoria vetra an intense woman in her mid thirties with the long stride of an impatient person makes her way across the floor to phillipe the project manager a frenchman
she follows him as he climbs down a scaffolding that surrounds the detector wheel and heads toward a console across the room
in italian subtitled somebody pulled us off the grid phillipe
responds in french also subtitled you hit kv down there yesterday
the whole synchrotron only loads
switching to french and the lears specked up to
its all approved by the director you want me to call him
reluctantly phillipe sits down at a console and starts entering commands shaking his head
waste of power whatre you extracting still ten to the seventh aps a second
how long to produce a gram at that rate
about two billion years
at that rate
he looks at her sideways didnt like the sound of that
he hits a few last keystrokes and a series of flashing lights reconnect what looks like a lower laboratory complex to the main grid
she nods her thanks and starts to go
switching to soft please dont blow us all to heaven
and on the word heaven everything goes white and a veil of thin white silk billows down over the face of the dead pontiff
two vatican funereal workers pull a second veil over his face then another over his head and hands
a burled cypress lid slides over the top of the coffin which is carried out of frame and into st
peters square packed with three hundred thousand mourners including kings queens presidents and prime ministers
following the elegy mass the body of the pontiff borne by the traditional twelve pall bearers will be sealed in a zinc crypt deep in the vatican grottoes along with
the bodies of twenty five other popes
the procession of cardinals is a ribbon of red making its way through the kaleidoscope of colors of the assembled religious dignitaries
on the brilliant array of colors
another array of colors this one like the best fireworks display youve ever seen
pulling back we realize its on one of the giant monitor screens in the detector room at cern all of which are lit up with similar arrays
something has happened and theres an enormous amount of excitement in the room
more scientists and technicians pour in take their seats at consoles confer excitedly
a computerized voice speaks english over a loudspeaker beam on beam collisions are active
it repeats the message in italian german french and chinese
elevator doors open in a subterranean tunnel and vittoria steps out
a long tube about four feet across runs off into the distance and as vittoria heads off in the other direction we see that the tunnel and its cylinder go
on forever that way too
two more technicians hurry down the tunnel and jump into the elevator she just vacated
vittoria steps up to a security panel and places her chin in a cup
a vertical laser sweeps across her eyeball and we an ancient carved incense holder that swings back and forth at the end of a chain swung by a priest in
a thousand faithful are gathered for the popes elegy mass led by cardinal saverio mortati dean of the college of cardinals at the front cardinal mortati stands behind a massive
altar arms outstretched praying in latin for the assembled luminaries
as he performs the service intoning in a dead language vittoria steps through an airlock and emerges in a gleaming white underground lab
everything everywhere is white
there are a dozen columns of polished steel about three feet tall each of which supports a transparent canister the size of a tennis ball can
they appear empty
leonardo bentivoglio sixtyish black pants and a short sleeve black shirt is at work at a command console in the center of the room
they speak to each other in italian subtitled
power should be back five by five
it is extractions already started
he turns around and we thought his black pants and shirt looked familiar now we see his roman collar and realize this physicist is also a priest
leonardo contd were in gods hands now
while leonardo and vittoria work at the console we move slowly across the room toward those strange vertical pillars
peters were in a complimentary move down the aisle past the college of cardinals one hundred sixty five aging men in brilliant red robes seated near the altar
the college of cardinals will lock itself in the sistine chapel for conclave literally the word means with key the process by which the church chooses a new leader for
the worlds one billion catholics
we move onto the altar close enough to mortati to get a good look at him
hes in his late seventies grave eyes closed in religious fervor as he consecrates the communion host
in the lab were still moving close to one of the pillars and to the transparent tube on top of it
the tube isnt empty as we first thought theres something suspended in the middle of it a drop round and white floating in mid air
mortati reaches the religious climax of the ceremony and holds aloft the round white communion host
a thousand voices begin singing in st
peters we go in close on the host and dissolve to that otherworldly drop also round and white a perfect match for the host but so different hovering in the
tube like a hot blob of mercury defying gravity
everything abruptly goes black and a title bleeds on screen the bottom of a swimming pool
a lithe figure slashes like a knife through the water doing laps
the swimmer is the only one in the pool but still pushes like hes got someone to beat
his strokes echo off vacant bleachers in an oldish college natatorium
as he reaches the end of the pool he sees a murky figure through the water
the swimmer stops pulls off his goggles
robert langdon is fiftyish but looks ten years younger must have something to do with two hundred laps at dawn every day
claudio vincenzo is heavier dressed in a sport jacket and slacks looks exhausted
he speaks with an italian accent
swim might help your jet lag
i beg your pardon
langdon gets out and pulls a towel off a nearby bench
bags under your eyes up at five a
do i hear naples in those rs
smiles shows an id claudio vincenzo corpo della gendarmeria vaticano
i was expecting another letter
vincenzo looks confused my request for access to the archives
vincenzo has no idea what hes talking about
langdon contd shouldnt you be in rome
busy time for you guys
in fact i was in new york on vacation
i got a call in the middle of the night find robert langdon
a matter of great urgency
urgent vatican business involving me
i doubt that
he heads for the locker room
vincenzo calls after him
they said to show you this
langdon turns back
vincenzos holding a single sheet of paper in his right hand
langdon curious makes his way back to him
takes the paper and it is safe to say feels the earth give way beneath his feet
he looks up eyes wide and mutters a single word llluminati
as the sun comes up langdon and vincenzo leave the natatorium
yes of course but it couldnt be the llluminati as we knew them they disappeared a hundred years ago
look at the paper
ive seen it
vincenzo looks at it
the word llluminati is written in ornate script
vincenzo looks back up so
langdon contd turn it upside down
incredibly the word reads exactly the same way upside down
langdon contd its called an ambigram the same backwards and forwards
thats common in a symbol like a jewish star or yin yang or a swastika but this is a word
people have searched for the llluminati ambigrammatic symbol for four centuries modern symbologists even tried to create it but nobody could pull it off not even by computer
most had concluded it was a myth
i wrote a book about it
which is why youre here isnt it
the art of the llluminati by robert langdon
a hand skims along a bookcase and stops at that very title a heavy academic tome
langdon pulls it out and drops it on the desk in his apartment with a thud
the apartment is cluttered with esoterica the home of a man whose taste in furnishings was very fashionable about four hundred years ago
a single man no kid stuff no cats
langdon flips the book open to an illustrated section in the middle filled with renderings of previous attempts to create the symbol he now holds in his hand
either someone just figured out how to make this or they found it
which would mean the llluminati have returned
looks at vincenzo an ancient brotherhood enemies of the church surfacing just after the death of a pope
id pull you off vacation too
its worse than just that
four cardinals were kidnapped from their quarters inside the vatican some time between three and five a
shortly afterward the office of the swiss guard received that document along with the threat that the cardinals will be publicly executed one per hour starting at seven p
tonight in rome
mind racing ahead conclave
was to begin today
we have postponed its start for a few hours a story of illness there are no suspicions
what do you want from me
the perpetrators of this heinous act sent that ambigram you say
as a provocation a taunt
but it may also be their undoing
if you can help us learn their identity perhaps we can stop them
and your involvement with recent church shall we say mysteries
i wasnt under the impression that episode had endeared me to the vatican
oh it didnt
but it made you what is the word
italian pronunciation formidable
a plane is standing by twenty minutes from here
will you come with me
langdon doesnt move just stares at the ambigram still amazed
vincenzo contd professor langdon you have spent ten years of your academic life searching for the very symbol you now hold in your hand
and the madman who created it or who knows the secrets of its origin that person is in rome
checks his watch how much longer must we pretend you have not already decided to come
a small private plane screams into the sky
we soar over rome the eternal city
a helicopter whooshes into frame below us
the papal helicopter is plush inside and nearly silent
a very pricey piece of equipment
vincenzo stares out the window
if the llluminati have returned and are in rome we will hunt them down and kill them
langdon seated across from him stifles a laugh
spoken like a roman catholic
vincenzo looks at him sharply
langdon contd the llluminati didnt become violent anti papists until the th century
initially they were physicists mathematicians astronomers
their name means the enlightened ones
in the s they started meeting secretly to share their concerns about the churchs inaccurate teachings
they were dedicated to the quest for scientific truth
and for that the church to use your words hunted them down and killed them
drove them underground
langdon turns and looks out the front window of the helicopter as up ahead the marble facade of st
peters basilica blazes like fire in the afternoon sun
langdon contd into a secret society
pulling away from the helicopter we see a coat of arms emblazoned on its side two skeleton keys crossing a shield and papal crown
the helicopter swoops over st
peters square filled with more tourists than usual due to the impending start of conclave
we drift toward a structure on the far side of the square closer to its huge ornate windows
as we approach large swaths of black drop down draping over the windows closing off our view
inside workers continue to drape large bolts of black velvet over the windows sealing this room off from outside
pulling back we realize its not just any room its the sistine chapel
as the last window is blackened the room is bathed in a profound darkness lit only by candles
one hundred sixty one men in red robes are gathered inside the chapel the college of cardinals
they talk in a polyglot of languages milling about the place conferring catching up on old friendships
cardinal mortati the dean of the college who led the popes elegy mass is the type of man one crosses a room to see not the other way around
he chats in italian with two other cardinals until a black cassocked aide father simeon outside the open doors of the chapel catches his eye
mortati excuses himself steps through the open doorway and into the salon just outside the chapel
father simeon is an unctuous man in his fifties with eyes that are always looking for whoevers behind you
they speak in italian subtitled
commandante rocher assures me the guard is doing everything humanly possible to find the prefiriti
a very long way for him to say very little
what if you were to begin in their absence
they are the four leading candidates
if theyre not present theyre not eligible
there will be no consensus without them wid are we to vote for
father simeon gives him a look perhaps you
mortati contd it is as much a sin to offer flattery to accept it
chastened but not the camerlengo asks how long you can postpone the opening prayer without making another announcement to the public
two years and three months
simeon looks confused the conclave of
mortati contd tell the camerlengo the cardinal electors will take every minute required to perform their sacred trust
no further announcements are necessary
hes be concerned about the public dimension
people will think cutting him off what we tell them to think
on the ground now and behind vatican walls langdon and vincenzo walk briskly around a corner and are met by ernesto olivetti a solidly built man in his late thirties
professor langdon welcome to vatican city
ernesto olivetti inspector generale of the vatican police force
he takes langdon by the arm and gestures down a narrow passageway
olivetti contd this way please well meet in the headquarters of the swiss guard
i assumed you were swiss guard
the gendarmerie is responsible for everything inside the vatican walls with the exception of the security of his holiness and the apostolic palace
that is swiss guard
the commandante generale of the roman carbinieri has joined us as well in an advisory capacity and the guarda nacionale have sent a representative
so jurisdictionally this is a god damn nightmare
they turn a corner and approach a squat stone building labeled offizia della guarda suiza
two swiss guardsmen are standing outside the entrance to the building
theyre somewhat comically dressed in puffy tunics vertically striped in brilliant blue and gold with matching pantaloons and spats topped by a black beret
langdon cant completely hide a smile
the guards raise their eight foot swords allowing the three of them to enter the building
the interior of the swiss guard offices is ornate and filled with artwork like every other vatican building
as they walk langdon studies the row of statues of male nudes that lines both sides of the hallway all wearing fig leaves
the great castration
i beg your pardon
pius ix felt the male form might inspire lust so he got a hammer and chisel and unmanned two hundred statues
these plaster fig leaves were added later
olivetti stops abruptly outside a heavy steel door with a security keyguard beside it
are you anti catholic professor langdon
no im anti vandalism
i urge you to guard your tone in there
the swiss guard is a calling not a profession and it encourages a certain zealotry
commander rocher the head of the guard is a deeply spiritual man and he was close to the late pope
i just hope i can help
so do i
you were my idea
he enters a five digit number on the keypad and the steel doors slide open
the headquarters of the swiss guard is in a lushly adorned renaissance library crammed with sophisticated communications and surveillance equipment
its crowded swiss guard in suits and ties the pantaloons are more for show uniformed carbinieri and vatican police crammed around different stations some working together others arguing mostly in
he crosses the room to a tall fair haired man around sixty weathered like steel maybe tempered is the better word
while they confer langdon notices a woman to his left
we recognize vittoria vetra the physicist we saw at cern
she catches langdons eye forces a grim smile recognizes theyre both strangers here
olivetti comes back with commander rocher the tall man very much in charge
he speaks with a french swiss to vittoria ms
im commander rocher commandante principale of the swiss guard
thank you for coming
and professor langdon
rocher looks him up and down so youre langdon
thank god the symbologist is here
vetra this way please
he leads vittoria across the room to a surveillance monitor
langdon puzzled by the cold shoulder looks at olivetti who leans in
theres been a development
we received another threat from the kidnapper
across the room they hear vittoria gasp
olivetti goes to join them nodding to langdon to follow
langdon and olivetti join rocher and vittoria and stare at the image on a video monitor its a familiar looking canister in which a metallic drop of liquid shimmers in
the middle suspended
the acronym cern is stenciled up its side
on its base is an led display counting down from about six hours
at the top of the monitor flashes superimposed text live feed canister was stolen from our lab around midnight last night
the intruder killed my research partner leonardo bentivoglio and mutilated him in order to bypass security
they look at her dont quite see the connection
vittoria contd we use retinal scanners
they still dont get it they cut out his eyes
vittoria contd that canister contains an extremely combustible substance called antimatter
we need to locate it immediately or evacuate vatican city
im quite familiar with incendiaries ms
i havent heard of antimatter
its new energy research technology
it uses a reverse polarity vacuum to filter out anti matter positrons generated in particle accelerations in the large hadron collider at cern
they look at her blankly
she points at the screen
vittoria contd the anti matter is suspended there in an airtight nanocomposite shell with electromagnets at each end
but if it were to fall out of suspension and come into contact with matter say the bottom of the canister the two opposing forces will annihilate one another
and what might cause it to fall out of suspension
the battery going dead
which it will
looks at the screen in six hours and eleven minutes
silence for a moment
vittoria contd where is that camera
number eighty six
it too was stolen
that could be anywhere inside the vatican walls
youve got to find it
were a bit preoccupied with four missing cardinals at the moment
you dont understand
an annihilation is a cataclysmic event
it would be a blinding explosion equivalent to about five megatons
the blast radius alone would be softly langdon speaks up from behind her
vatican city will be consumed by light
a few voices fall still
they turn and look at him
those are the exact words the kidnapper used
a few moments later theyre crowded around the communications console at rochers desk where a dimly lit video recording is playing back on a computer screen
the office is behind a glass wall to one side of the headquarters
the images on the recording are of four older men some in their sixties the others in their seventies filmed in dim light behind bars in a dank dungeon like
a lightly accented voice speaks from behind the camera
we will destroy your four pillars
brand your preferiti and sacrifice them on the altars of science
and then bring your church down upon you
vatican city will be consumed by light
its an ancient llluminati threat
rocher pauses the recording the destruction of vatican city through light
the four pillars he probably means the kidnapped cardinals
you didnt mention they were the preferiti
to vittoria the favorites to be chosen as the new pope
play it again
we will destroy your four pillars
brand your preferiti and sacrifice them on the altars of science
stop it there
rocher does langdon contd brand them another llluminati legend this one says there are a set of five brands each one an ambigram
langdon contd the first four are the fundamental elements of science earth air fire water
the fifth is a mystery
maybe its this
he pulls the llluminati ambigram from his pocket
he said theyd be killed publicly
nods not surprised revenge for la purga
dont you guys read your own history
the church kidnapped four llluminati scientists and branded their chests with the symbol of the cross
to purge their sins
murdered them and left their bodies in the street as a warning to others to stop questioning church rulings on scientific matters
it was after la purga that a darker more violent llluminati emerged
this sounds like retribution
to rocher is there any more
rocher hits play again
and then bring your church down upon you
vatican city will be consumed by light
while listening this time langdon notices a darkened video monitor inlaid at an angle on rochers desk
it faces away from the outer office and instead of an on off switch there is an oddly shaped keyhole
contd a shining star at the end of the path of illumination
langdon looks up sharply
the path of illumination
rocher stops the video
langdon contd i need to get into the vatican archives
rocher shakes his head looks at olivetti harshly is embarrassed
professor this is not the appropriate moment to your petition has been denied seven times mr
this has nothing to do with that the path of illumination is an ancient trail through rome that leads to the church of the illumination a secret place where llluminati
members could meet in safety
if i can find the segno the sign that marks the start of the path im willing to bet the four churches along it are where he intends to murder
if we can get to one of them before he does we can stop it
but to find the start of the path i need to get into the archives
even if i wanted to help you access is only by written decree of the curator and the board of vatican librarians
or by papal mandate
but as youve no doubt heard the holy father is what about il camerlengo
let me talk to him
hes just a priest here the former popes chamberlain
doesnt the power of the holy see rest with him during tempe sede vacante
they just stare at him
shit this guys good
langdon checks his watch getting irritated
langdon contd hey fellas you called me
a spectacular view of st
peters square through the windows of the papal offices
moving down we find a figure dressed in a simple black cassock his back to us staring out at the crowd
father sebastian guttierez the camerlengo speaks with a soft spanish accent
his holiness once told me that a pope is a man torn between two worlds
the real world and the divine
assembled in the grand office are langdon rocher olivetti and vittoria
the camerlengos back is still turned
camerlengo contd he warned that any church that ignored reality would not survive to enjoy the divine
he turns around
hes younger than we thought in his mid thirties deep dark eyes
the kind of priest who often inspires before the years of dogma catch up with him
camerlengo contd it seems the real world is upon us tonight
to langdon im familiar with llluminati lore and the legend of the brandings
la purga is a dark stain on the churchs history im not surprised this ghost has come back to haunt us
he sits behind the massive desk and if he seemed young before he seems like a child now overcome by the position hes in
but when he speaks to rocher hes in command
camerlengo contd commandante have you begun a search for this explosive device
of course but it could be anywhere and the safety of the cardinals is my primary concern at the moment
the sistine chapel is a fortress as long as the cardinals are in conclave your security concerns are at a minimum
devote as much of your resources as possible to a search for signore if youre about to suggest we make a naked eye search of all of vatican city i
though i am not his holiness when you address me you are addressing this office
do you understand
yes padre good
now you said the image on screen was illuminated by artificial light
may i suggest methodically cutting the power to various sections of the city
when the image on your screen goes dark youll have a more specific idea of the devices location
rocher looks at olivetti gotta admit thats a pretty damn good idea
camerlengo contd ms
besides yourself and your research partner who knew about your antimatter project
only the director of cern
but leonardo kept detailed journals if he told anyone else about what we were doing he would have made a note of it
do you have these journals
i can have them flown here from geneva in an hour
he pauses thinking then turns the phone on his desk to face her
while she picks it up to dial the camerlengo comes around his desk to speak privately to langdon
youre correct that i may grant you access to the archives
thank you padre
i said youre correct that i may not that i will
christianitys most sacred codices are in that archive
given your recent entanglement with the church i need to ask you a question first
langdon looks at him fire away
camerlengo contd do you believe in god sir
father i simply believe that religions can often i didnt ask if you believe what man says about god i asked if you believe in god
im an academic
my mind tells me i will never understand god
and your heart
tells me im not meant to
the camerlengo looks at him thats not quite good enough
langdon contd i believe that faith is a gift which i have not been fortunate enough to receive
the camerlengo looks at him for a long moment
pretty damn good answer
he puts a hand on langdons shoulder and leans in
be delicate with our treasures
the back doors of the apostolic palace bang open and langdon is ushered out fast by olivetti the head of the vatican police
the archives are this way
they turn down a narrow passageway
a voice calls from behind them
vittoria catches up to them
vittoria contd if this path really leads to the church of illumination that may be where theyve hidden the antimatter
a shining star at the end of the path
my thoughts exactly
to vittoria if we find this bomb can you deactivate it
no but i can change its battery as long as it has more than five minutes of life
that would give us another twenty four hours to get it back to olivetti nods to her come on along
they walk again holds a hand out to langdon
vittoria contd vittoria vetra
are you really a symbologist or was he mocking you
youre a physicist
bio entanglement physics
interconnectivity of life systems
what are we looking for in the archives
a little book written by galileo
galileo was llluminati
and a devout catholic
he thought science and religion werent enemies but two different languages telling the same story
he wanted like minds to be able to find the church of illumination but he couldnt exactly advertise its location so he created a coded path
an unknown llluminati master sculpted four statues each a tribute to one of the four fundamental elements earth air fire water and put them out in public in churches throughout
each statue held a clue pointing to the next
and at the end of the trail was the church of illumination
vicenzo leading them turns up via sentinel and starts up the hill toward the archives
they follow quickly
what makes you think hes going to murder the cardinals in the churches
the llluminati called those four churches by a special name laltare di scienza
the altars of science
making the sacrifice them on the altars of science he said
langdon stops in his tracks
hes staring up at the impressive facade of the vatican archives
he takes a deep breath then steps forward to enter
but vincenzo doesnt follow
langdon looks at him
langdon contd we go in alone
vatican police arent allowed access to the archives only swiss guard
chartrand will meet you inside
ill be here when youre done
langdon turns back to the archives with a look of deep contentment hes wanted in here for a long long time
and steps through the double doors
the camerlengo walks briskly through the hallways of the apostolic palace deep in thought
he reaches the top of the royal staircase and can hear the rumbling of activity in the sistine chapel below
looking down the stairs he sees the doorway open and the gathering of cardinals inside
as he reaches the base of the stairs cardinal mortati who has been summoned steps outside to meet him flanked by his aide father simeon
vincenzo leading them turns up via sentinel and starts up the hill toward the archives
they follow quickly
they speak in english their common language
youve been informed of the new situation
may gods mercy be upon us
and the other cardinals
await your word
the camerlengo thinks feels the weight of this decision on his young shoulders
may i ask your guidance padre
my belief is we should proceed with the sealing of conclave
at this hour
that would be highly unorthodox
and yet within church law
its in my power ive been chosen great elector
the cruelest honor in christendom
the only ambitions i have are for my church
peters church which is under attack at its most vulnerable moment
this is not a coincidence
is it possible our enemies hope to distract us from our sacred task
the church will not fall in a day
we may be wise to consider evacuation
that is exactly what they want publicity and panic
we must not give them oxygen for the media fire
what of the safety of the cardinals
surely there is not an elector present who values his physical being more than the unbroken leadership of the holy see
and the people in st
they care as deeply about their church as we do
their faith will sustain them
but if their faith does not protect them from an explosion
were all bound for heaven eventually are we not
spoken like one who has enjoyed the blessings of a long and full life
mortati bristles at the thinly veiled insult
signore do not confuse the power of the office you temporarily hold with your true place here in the vatican
you were a favorite of his holiness but his holiness is with his father now
satisfied mortati looks back over his shoulder at the anxious faces in the chapel
then turns back to the camerlengo
seal the doors
with a heavy thud the huge doors close and bolts slam into place
an ancient key grinds in an ornate lock two heavy chains rattle into place four swiss guard take position in front of the doors and at that very moment two
huge modern glass doors whoosh open revealing what looks like a rd century library
its a massive underground space like a darkened airplane hangar with a dozen glass boxes evenly spaced throughout
theyre lit up from within each containing row upon row of bookshelves neatly filled with books papers and arcana
chartrand a twenty five year old member of the swiss guard in a suit and earpiece not the traditional garb leads langdon and vittoria toward the glass enclosures
swiss accent the chambers are hermetic vaults oxygen is kept at lowest possible levels
its a partial vacuum inside
more than ten minutes in the vault is not recommended without breathing apparatus
he stops at one particular chamber and gestures to the sign on its door il processo galileano
chartrand contd ill be just outside the door
langdon starts toward the entrance to the vault but chartrand puts a hand on his chest stopping him
chartrand contd watching you mr
langdon looks at him
hes not popular around here
the electronic revolving door spins and admits langdon to the interior of the vault
he takes a deep breath holds it and lets it out
vittoria follows shortly behind him and shes unprepared the lack of oxygen hits her hard she dizzies
take a moment
if you feel double vision double over
bends over feels like im
with the wrong mixture
plenty of time
he checks his watch
langdon contd uh
actually i take that back
in a dark space a tea bag bobs delicately up and down in a cup of hot water
an elegant man in his forties dressed in a casual suit no tie hums softly to himself as he steeps his tea
no idea of his name but his suit is gray so how about mr
the tea is on an old wooden table being heated by a small can of sterno
gray bobs the tea bag he stares at something to his right
a lot of it in a number of different denominations neatly segmented in a briefcase
and three passports all different colors and nationalities neatly placed on top of it
gray clicks the briefcase shut and slides it under the table tucking it up against the wall
he removes the cup from the heat still bobbing the tea bag
he walks lit by candlelight that throws harsh shadows on strange walls
he heads down a very dark hallway past a row of stonewalled cells and within each is the dimly lit figure of the older men we saw on the videotape
earlier the kidnapped cardinals
he stops at the last cell where the man cardinal lamasse looks up at him from the wooden bench hes sitting on
you have no idea what youre missing
conclave will go on without us
the voice of god will not be silenced
i was referring to my tea
last chance id be happy to make you a cup
may god forgive you for what youve done
father if god has issues they wont be with what ive done seems genuinely saddened but with what im about to do
grays hand takes the burning tin of sterno and tosses it into a fireplace where the liquid fire consumes a pile of dry kindling
he picks up something else and places it in the heart of the flames
a long handled iron rod
inside the archive vittoria is searching the lower shelves while langdon on a ladder digs through folio bins higher up
confiscated from the netherlands by the vatican shortly after galileos death
ive been petitioning to see it for almost ten years
ever since i realized what was in it
what makes you so sure the segno is there
while searching the number
i kept seeing it over and over in llluminati letters scribbled in the margins or sometimes just signed that way
its a numerical clue but to what
five of course is the sacred llluminati number the pentagram pythagoras a dozen other examples in science but why three
langdon contd it made no sense
and then i thought what if it were a roman numeral
galileos third text
ticking them off dialogo
his eyes light up as he pulls a slender volume out of a folio bin on one of the top shelves
langdon contd diagramma
langdon now wearing white cotton gloves sets the tiny manuscript on a viewing stand
diagramma della verita
the diagram of truth
i know about dialogo and discorsi galileo laid out his theories about the earth revolving around the sun and the church forced him to recant
but what was this
this is where he got the word out
the truth not what the vatican forced him to write
smuggled out of rome and printed in holland on sedge papyrus
that way any scientists caught with a copy could simply drop it in water and the booklet would dissolve
carefully he turns the first page
langdon contd between its delicate nature and the vatican burnings its said this is the only copy that remains
turns the second page
langdon contd and if im right the segno should be hidden and the third on page number and the fourth five
they study the page langdon contd latin
she reaches for the book to pull it towards her but langdon slaps her hand
he holds up his own glove finger acids
she rolls her eyes and leans in studying the page
there are sketches on the page as well
movement of the planets
this doesnt sound right
vittoria turns the page turns it back
vittoria contd im sorry i dont think theres anything that could be interpreted as a do that again
she turns the page then turns it back
noticing something in the deep crevice of the margin as the page moves langdon grabs a magnifying glass on the end of a long pole and swings it over
there in the print gutter what looked like a smudge is revealed under the magnifier to be langdon contd a line of text
no one spoke it at the vatican
it was considered polluted
too free thinking the language of radicals like shakespeare and chaucer
he rotates the book
langdon contd another line
he keeps rotating the book finds two more tiny lines written at the very edges barely visible to the naked eye
langdon contd the path of light is laid the sacred test
i need a pen we have to transcribe this
before langdon can do anything to stop her she rips the page from the text and shoves it in her pocket
langdons jaw drops
he shoots a look over his shoulder at lt
chartrand but the mans back is turned
ah what the hell
he snaps the magnifying glass off the end of its pole
the doors slam on a vatican police car and the tires squeal as olivetti hits the gas
olivetti is behind the wheel vittorias in front langdon leans in from the back seat
twenty minutes till eight where are we headed
ill know in a minute give me the paper
vittoria pulls the page from the diagramma out of her pocket and hands it to langdon
he pulls the magnifier from his coat and studies the thin paper turning it in his hands
langdon contd from santis earthly tomb with demons hole
where did you get that paper
cross rome the mystic elements unfold
we borrowed it
the path of light is laid the sacred test
are you insane
let angels guide you on your earthly quest
you removed a document from the vatican archives
oh um well she moved so fast
the first marker sounds like its at santis tomb
but who is santi
santi was his last name
so the path starts at raphaels tomb
not entirely yeah
raphael is buried at the pantheon
is the pantheon even a church
snatching up the oldest catholic church in rome
langdon has fallen silent but it all makes perfect sense so he says nothing as olivetti cranks the wheel hard the car fishtails into a and they take off in
the opposite direction headed for the pantheon
the police car pulls to a stop as quietly as possible across an open plaza from the pantheon
two black alfa romeos with tinted windows glide to a stop on either side of them
as langdon and the others get out commander rocher and three more swiss guard all in black suits surround them
rocher goes straight to langdon highly skeptical
ive just pulled a dozen of my best men from vatican city during conclave and left the search for the antimatter device in the hands of secondary officers
youd better be right
i believe i am
the pantheon is one of the busiest tourist spots in rome how could he hope to get away with it
as impossible as kidnapping four cardinals from vatican city
the poem is precise
olivetti catches eyes with langdon whos still clutching the page pulled from the diagramma
he slips it quietly into his jacket pocket
im basing this operation on an americans interpretation of a four hundred year old poem
the information we have clearly refers to raphaels tomb and raphaels tomb is inside that building
she points to the pantheon its edifice shimmering in the early evening light
the pantheon is your one chance to catch this guy
i thought you said four
a pathway four markers
well have four chances to catch him
you would have a hundred years ago
the vatican had all the pagan statues in the pantheon removed and destroyed in the late s
whatever marker was there to lead us to the next church is gone now
the path is dead
this is your chance
rocher looks at him for a long moment then turns abruptly to a
cars to piazza della rotunda via degli orfani piazza santignazio and sant eustachio
no closer than two blocks no uniforms three minutes
the officer salutes and they snap into action
rocher contd and i need a set of eyes inside
two beefy guardsmen in black suits step forward
wait a minute youll scare him off
theyre not in uniform
im sorry two weightlifters in matching black suits and earpieces theyre hardly disguised
theres no time to get undercover men here
im not sending a wom her arched eyebrow stops his sentence in its tracks
rocher contd a civilian into this situation
you have no communications and you cant carry a walkie talkie its too conspicuous
tourists have cell phones dont they
pulls out her own and holds it to her ear hi honey im at the pantheon you should see this place
rocher seems to be thinking about it
langdon looks at her his protective instincts aroused
you cant send her in there alone
i dont intend to
close on a pair of hands linked
vittoria and langdon holding hands like lovers walk slowly toward the entrance to the pantheon
a couple dozen tourists blissfully unaware mill about the square while up on the rooftops snipers have them in view
langdon looks around this wasnt what he had in mind
vittoria glances at him amused
youre crushing my hand
a nervous newlywed
he puts an arm around her waist feels a lump in her back
you really know how to use that gun gave you
i can tag a breaching porpoise from forty meters off the bow of a rocking ship
thought you said you were a physicist i am
make it short
cant be done
what time is it
langdon raises his hand and checks his watch
seven minutes to eight
of the watch was that mickey mouse
make it short
cant be done
and with that they step through the entrance and into the pantheon a massive circular room with a foot unsupported span even larger than the cupola of st
there are a dozen tourists scattered around and a tour group on one side hearing a lecture from a museum docent
langdon looks up at the hole in the ceiling through which a bright shaft of light is shining
that could be the demons hole in the poem
looking around vittoria sees several sarcophagi scattered around the room all pointing obliquely in a certain direction
as they move stealthily through the crowd they speak in low tones why are the tombs at an angle
to face east
but this is a christian church
new religions often adopt existing holidays to make conversion less shocking
december th was the pagan holiday of the unconquered sun
made it a handy choice for christs birthday
youre saying christianity is repackaged sun worship
where do you think halos came from
not just sun worship though the catholics borrowed communion from the aztecs canonization from euphemerus the cruciform from the egyptians no wonder they dont like you around here
just trying to keep the conversation lively
check the recesses
ill go left
see you in a hundred eighty degrees
he starts to the left she goes to the right walking in the shadowy recesses behind the pillars at the edges of the room
langdon walks slowly checking out faces
around every column there are shadows and in those shadows nothing
he looks at his watch
five minutes to eight
and then a shriek from the other side of the room
he whirls sees vittoria backing away from something
langdon contd vittoria
he races across the room reaches her at the far side
her face is ashen
shes pointing at something aghast
but langdon rushes forward to the crypt
there doesnt seem to be anything out of the ordinary except vittoria contd its the wrong one
what are you talking about
he leans down looks at the plaque on it
he was moved here in
a century after diagramma was published
thats not possible the poem said where was he originally buried
i dont know
urbino i think
thinking like crazy santis earthly tomb
what else could it possibly
santi s tomb
his eyes flit around the room from one ornate sarcophagus to another
and then it hits him langdon contd damn it
santis tomb must mean one of the chapels he built
hes not buried in it he designed it
rich people commissioned burial chapels in churches all over rome in his day
looks up and the demons hole it isnt the oculus its an undercroft a crypt common sixteenth century term
at that very moment the tour group is passing them and the elderly docent asks his group the perfunctory wrap up does anyone have any questions
langdon busts in on the group
did raphael santi ever design a chapel with an ossuary annex and angel figure commissioned by the catholic church
the docent blinks
wasnt expecting quite so esoteric a question
langdon contd well
im sorry i
i can only think of one
langdon suppresses the urge to grab him by the lapels and shake it out of him
a clock in the square outside the pantheon says
langdon and vittoria face rocher olivetti and half a dozen swiss guard
what do you mean wrong
the first altar of science is the chigi chapel in the church of santa maria del popolo about a mile from here
it used to be called capella della terra chapel of the earth
earth the first element
this is it im certain
you were certain of the pantheon
please we have four minutes
rocher looks at langdon with contempt then barks orders to his men in italian
they begin to head for their cars
back to the vatican
commandante if you care at all about your church my church
my church feeds the hungry comforts the sick and dying
what does your church do professor
no answer ah thats right you havent one
he turns and walks away glaring at olivetti
rocher contd take him if you want but im done with him
olivettis car screeches to a halt in the piazza del popolo at sunset
langdon vittoria olivetti and vincenzo the vatican cop who first came to see langdon all climb out start scanning the square
this is the place
he points to an obelisk in the center of the square
langdon contd an obelisk with a pyramid at the top
both masonic symbols
the illuminati were infiltrators
there isnt a powerful organization on earth they didnt place members in
look at a dollar bill some time
a pyramid an occult symbol representing convergence upward with the eye of illumination above it and beneath it the latin for new world order
the united states government was infiltrated by illuminati
fdrs vice president was a high ranking freemason
convinced him the words in latin actually meant new deal
a church bell begins to toll
langdon takes off running toward and eleventh century church at the southwest corner of the plaza covered in scaffolding
at the front door of the church langdon hops over the sawhorses blocking the entrance and tries the door
a sign says the place is under construction
at a side door olivetti races alongside the church followed by the others
he reaches a door with a large heavy ring and pulls it toward him
but the door won t budge
he pushes throws his shoulder into it
no no its an annulus
but olivetti just races onward looking for another door followed by vincenzo
as they disappear around the back of the church langdon steps up to the large ring gives it an almighty twist and the heavy door clunks open
the interior of the church is an obstacle course of torn up flooring brick pallets mounds of dirt
silt drifts in the dying sunlight that shines through the broken windows and walls
langdon and vittoria walk slowly to the middle of the floor at one end of the chapel
there are eight recesses four on either side of a central aisle all covered with large sheets of plastic to protect them during construction
the chapel is in one of those apses
the plastic rustles ominously
anything could be behind any one of them
vittoria pulls the gun from her waistband and holds it in front of her
langdon notices it makes him uncomfortable
langdon contd you have to give that back
she looks at him what are you nuts
something rushes at them from the side she whirls and nearly blows olivetti to kingdom come as he and vincenzo barrel in through the side door
langdon gestures everybody quiet
olivetti points to the left gestures to langdon and vittoria to go to the right
they separate to either side of the main aisle
langdon pulls the plastic aside eyes scan the chapel
olivetti does the same at another chapel
vittoria pushes the plastic aside gun in front of her
theres a sudden movement to her left she whirls and a rat scurries away
langdon pushes the plastic aside steps inside and gasps
moving behind him we see a christian chapel like no other weve ever seen
finished entirely in chestnut marble overhead it has a domed cupola with a field of illuminated stars and the seven planets as known in galileos day
further down the wall there are tributes to earths four seasons but most incredible of all are the two huge structures that dominate the room from either side
ten feet high
vittoria steps in behind him
in a catholic church
this is it
behind them the plastic rustles as if drawn by a wind and as langdon turns he hears faintly a door closing far away
he turns back eyes drawn to the floor
there is a large oval medallion there with a skeleton carved into it
its slightly off center raised
as if its been opened recently and hurriedly replaced
langdon contd the demons hole
were looking up now as the medallion grinds to the side
faces peer down at us langdon vittoria olivetti and vincenzo
they recoil from a stench
langdon squints trying to see inside
anybody got a flashlight
vincenzo hands him one
langdon shines it down into the crypt
there are shapes but thirty feet down and hard to make out
theres one in particular in the darkness seems too short to be a person but its moving slightly
can you tell what it is
not from up here
he reaches down rattles the ladder that leans against the wall of the crypt
takes a deep breath looks at the others
langdon contd those guns
keep em handy
langdon reaches the bottom still shining the light at the figure in the distance
its brighter here he can see its flesh colored but still indistinct
he takes a step toward it and something crunches under his feet
he shines the light down
hes standing on a pile of human skulls calling down you okay
more or less
he takes two more steps closer to the swaying figure on the other side of the crypt
he can now clearly see a mans naked back
langdon contd hes here
i think hes sitting
moves closer hello
closer still are you all right
its a human figure
as langdon draws close he sees the source of the movement rats gnawing at the dead body
they scurry away as langdon comes around the front and we pull back to see what he sees
its cardinal lamasse
hes been buried in the earthen floor of the crypt up to his waist his jaw broken his mouth crammed full of dirt
but thats not the worst of it
langdon gags as he sees the blackened word that has been branded into the red flesh of the cardinals chest
its an ambigram like weve seen before but this time it says cardinal mortati sits regally at the main altar at the front of the sistine chapel as the electors
one by one cast their votes in the traditional manner
an african cardinal at the front of the line kneels before him
i call as my witness christ the lord who will be my judge that my vote is given to the one who before god i think should be elected
the african cardinal stands holds his ballot over his head t lowers the ballot to the altar where a plate sits atop a large chalice
he places the ballot on the plate then picks up the plate and uses it to drop the ballot in the chalice
he then replaces the plate over the chalice bows to the cross and heads for his seat
the next cardinal steps up to repeat the process
and the line is gone
mortati holds the chalice with all the votes
he shakes it chooses one eligo in summum pontificem and reads an unfamiliar name
he makes a note in a ledger then raises a threaded needle and pierces the ballot through the word eligo sliding the ballot on the thread
and there are a hundred and sixty one ballots on the thread mortati looks up from his ledger and speaks to the room
the first ballot has failed
he takes he thread carrying all the ballots and ties the ends together to create a ring
he lays the ring of ballots on a silver tray
dusts the tray heavily with a yellowish powder
on a small incinerator
the ring of ballots is hurled inside and bursts immediately into flame
a dark brackish smoke billows up from the burning ballots and we follow the smoke up up into the chimney and to the roof of the sistine chapel where the
black iupke puffs out into the early evening sky
below a crowd of thousands groans in disappointment as the message is sent no new pope yet
but while they are all watching the smoke we turn our attention
to the opposite direction to the east across rome to where those black alfa romeos four this time glide silently to a halt outside the church where langdon just found
swiss guard in black suits pour out of the vehicles and hurry into the church trying to attract as little attention as possible
the inside of the church is being sealed off as a crime scene
rocher just arriving takes charge as the plastic is ripped off the chigi chapel
get that body out of there and search the rest of the building
swiss guardsmen drop into the demons hole to remove the body
rocher contd to another guardsman outside a perimeter
secure but invisible
no lights no guns no one knows
langdon lost in thought drifts through the small chapel studying the intricate carvings and other artwork
rocher passes through his field of vision livid why the hell didnt you figure this out in the first place
it was more a rhetorical question but langdon answers honestly still lost in thought his voice soft
i made a mistake
he drifts toward a statue of the highest quality white marble resting in a niche on the far side out of the way of the mayhem
vittoria joins him
is it raphael
the chapel is
but the sculptures are bernini
the unknown illuminati master was bernini
didnt he work for the church
it means the illuminati even infiltrated the vatican
they hid in plain sight
he steps closer to the statue
its of two life size human figures intertwined one a regal bearded man the other a cherub floating overhead
langdon contd habakkuk and the angel
the prophet who predicted the annihilation of the earth
this is the first marker
he steps closer studying it carefully
langdon contd let angels guide you on your lofty quest
his eyes move slowly over the statue and ours do too from the angels innocent face down his arm and to his right hand which is outstretched one finger extended
pointing the way
langdon contd the path is alive
langdon dashes down the stairs outside the church and into the middle of the piazza
its getting dark now shadows streaking the square
it points southwest
he gets his bearings looks to the southwest sees nothing but buildings in the way
he runs back up the church steps where vittoria and rocher are just coming outside
langdons mind is racing
langdon contd earth air fire water were looking for a bernini sculpture having something to do with air
to rocher and the next church is southwest of here
youre sure this time
i need a map
one that shows all the churches in rome
rocher just stares at him studying him
langdon contd i could use it now
rocher starts down the steps toward his car
langdon contd and a compass
he looks around sees the rickety scaffolding outside the church and
he climbs into our view now on the scaffolding
hes moving upward fast toward the roof of the old church also undergoing renovation
the view of rome is spectacular from up here and langdon rushes to the western wall looking intently off in that direction
he sees something that makes him suck in his breath hears a voice from behind him robert
and turns as vittoria tosses something small and black up to him
he catches it holds it steady and walks toward the edge of the roof as the compass needle swivels and settles on sw
langdon looks up following the line of the needle up over the rooftops of rome to a massive structure in the distance exactly in line with the compass needle
a huge dome on the horizon blots out the setting sun
close on a map of rome unfolded in the back seat of a racing car and spread out over langdon and vittorias laps
langdon has a pen and is drawing a line on the map through the black rectangles with crosses are churches and none of them intersect the line until it comes
to an end right in the middle of st
night has fallen and the four alfa romeos are now speeding across rome
no sirens but lots of speed
olivetti drives rocher is in the passenger seat
your theory doesnt hold up professor
michelangelo designed st
peters not bernini
the basilica is michelangelo but the square is bernini
the second marker must be a statue in the square
its ten minutes till nine
can we go any faster
not unless we want the full attention of the world press
she looks down to two television screens mounted into the backs of the front seats
both are tuned to coverage of the papal selection process reporters doing stand ups from the middle of crowded st
we move in on one of the images then into the image coming out on a television monitor in st
the reporter a japanese woman is giving a stand up report on the progress so far gesturing to the chimney over the sistine chapel
the crowd has grown now four thousand maybe five
a few protesters chant
almost silently behind them all half a dozen black alfa romeos race in too fast and come to an abrupt halt
they all get out trying to avoid causing a panic
langdon walks into the square eyes focused on an object in the middle
he looks up at row after row of statues that ring the square from atop the oval colonnades
sharpshooters scurry among the statuary setting themselves up
in the crowd rocher mutters into his radio and to undercover swiss guard scattered throughout
the crowd is unaware of them
langdon keeps walking turning in circles looking above him to the tops of the colonnades that border the square
there must be a hundred statues up there which one is it
how in gods name would anyone make a sculpture about air
and indeed there are
langdon looks at his watch
two minutes to nine
and then he freezes
staring down not up
he takes a step back
there is a fresco carved into the square beneath his feet or more accurately langdon contd bas relief
he takes a step back to look at the carving as does vittoria
langdon contd the other half of sculpture is bas relief
to vittoria look for more
something having to do with air
they move through the crowd pushing people aside causing a bit of a ruckus as they try to uncover the elaborate carvings in the stone of the square
if we are eagle eyed at this point we will see two robed men one helping the other who carries a cross as they pass through the crowd behind langdon
remembering something langdon rushes forward toward the center of the square uncharacteristically brusque with the crowd shoving his way through now
he draws close to one carving in particular slows to a stop and stares down at it eyes wide
its a carving of an angels face cheeks billowing outward as it blows a gust of wind symbolized by five vertical streaks
its title is
langdon contd west ponente
the west wind
an angels face and five streaks
so this is it but now what
they look around frantically scanning the crowd
so does rocher so does olivetti
the bells of st
peters start to toll the hour
a little girl dances with a doll
happily unaware of whats going on
some protesters tangle
some believe one thing others dont
swiss guard and vatican police race in to break it up
but theres no bloodshed
a robed man carrying a small wooden cross falls to the ground
somebody near him screams
the little girl is jostled by a homeless man drops her doll
is helped to his feet by the police
he wanders away holding his cross high
and as he passes us we catch just a glimpse of his face and recognize mr
bends down picks up her doll and sees she looks down at the ground sees a trail of blood follows it with her eyes to where the homeless man dressed
in torn rags leans against a fountain gasping for breath
vittoria and langdon hear the screams
theyre closest and theyre at the fountain in just a few seconds
langdon drops to his knees turns the homeless man over
through the mans torn shirt he can see a black and red brand burned into his chest
three letters ornate script reading the same front to back vittoria grabs his arm feels for a pulse
hes still alive
but the dying cardinal is gasping for breath his mouth opening and closing like a fish on a dock
she bends down arches his neck closes her mouth over his and blows air into his lungs
immediately a fog of red mist billows from two puncture holes in the mans chest covering langdon in blood his face his clothes
vittoria contd his chest
they punctured his lungs
langdon recoils in horror overcome completely out of his depth
rocher arrives as does olivetti as do a dozen more swiss guard and vatican police
rocher looks around defeated and enraged as the cardinal expires and the crowd panics fleeing in all directions
he presses his radio to his lips and keys the mic
clear the square
blood and water swirl down a drain
langdon looks up from the sink water rushing from his face
he dries himself looks in the mirror
he holds up his hands
hes standing in a lavish marble bathroom now cleaned up and changed into black pants and a black long sleeved shirt
no roman collar they dont just give you those but clearly the clothes of a priest
he steps out of the bathroom and into
the papal office where the camerlengo rocher olivetti and vittoria are gathered again as are half a dozen other security officers
its crowded busy little knots of jurisdictional arguments and competing theories around the room
the camerlengo at his desk is stunned speaking to olivetti
langdon edges close enough to hear but not too close
when did this call come in
three four minutes ago
the same voice as on the tape
were analyzing the accent now alsatian is our best guess at the moment
and he actually claimed responsibility for the death of his holiness
not personally but he said it was the illuminati
he said they murdered him
thats ridiculous the holy father died of a stroke
did he say how they claim to have done it
the popes own medication
a drug known as heparin
there is silence for a moment
rocher looks up
the pope took heparin
he had thrombophlebitis
he took an injection once a day
but no one knew that
his holiness had health concerns he was subject to seizures as well
but he took steps to make sure he was watched
thats all he wished to be made public and thats all we should discuss
ignoring him heparin is lethal in the wrong dosage
an overdose would cause massive internal bleeding and brain hemorrhages
at first it might look like a stroke but in a few days his body would show signs we could easily rocher spins on her livid
vetra in case youre unaware papal autopsies are prohibited by vatican law
we are not about to defile his holinesss body just because his enemies claim to of course were not
well make a public announcement refuting this absurd claim
father simeon cardinal mortatis aide steps forward
im afraid thats out of the question
cardinal mortati has insisted this entire matter be kept internal
cardinal mortati shouldnt even be aware of this hes locked in conclave
his final instructions before sealing the doors were very clear no outside communications unless absolutely necessary
cardinal mortati will remember that he is dean of the college of cardinals not his holiness himself
as you say
yet technically now that conclave has begun it is his privilege and duty to control public announcements
ive drafted a short release about the incident in the square but any other statements are specifically prohibited
for that the cardinal has asked me to remind you we have a chimney
the camerlengo just stares at him a power struggle
which he is going to lose
as you say
turns away commander rocher the search for the device
weve turned the power off and on to about twenty percent of vatican city
nothing on the video yet
langdon youve been right so far if belatedly about the path
its now nine fifteen how quickly can you find the next church
langdon refers to a map spread out on the desk
the line of the breath in the carving points due east directly away from vatican city but there are five lines so theres room for error
while he talks an aide in a business suit is ushered quietly in the door by a swiss guardsman
hes carrying a satchel
vittoria recognizes him and he goes to her
langdon contd there are about twenty churches that intersect it
none of their names invoke fire but there must be a bernini sculpture inside one of them that does
im going to need to get back into the archives to find it
to olivetti escort him
langdon looks to vittoria you coming
she looks up from a table where shes opened the satchel brought in by the aide
she holds two leather bound books in her hand
the journals i asked for
id like to stay here and study them
if leonardo told anyone else about our project that could be the killer
the group starts to break up half of them headed for the doors
as langdon rolls up the map on the desk the camerlengo notices his black clothes for the first time
camerlengo contd professor would it surprise you to find those clothes suit you
langdon manages a sliver of a smile starting to like this guy
it would surprise the hell out of me
peters has been cleared out the throng moved to barricades at its edges so that the crime scene can be properly investigated
flashbulbs pop everywhere
the row of tv reporters is nearly shoulder to shoulder and we move along them first up is an italian reporter a statement just released by the vatican expressing sympathy
for the family of the mugging victim a tourist from dusseldorf still moving we pass a chinese reporter
who is now confirmed dead
vatican police have a suspect in custody and after photographing the crime scene still moving a french reporter
will allow the crowds of faithful back into st
peters square where security will be doubled
still moving a bbc reporter in english
sadly the vatican spokesman points out where crowds go and finally an american
so often follows crime
were trying now to get the name of the tourist who was wait a the american reporter looks confused somebodys talking to her in her earpiece
american reporter contd were getting word now of smoke smoke from the sistine chapel chimney apparently theres been another vote i and almost as one the row of tv cameras
all swing away from the crime scene in the square and up to the sistine chapel chimney where there is indeed a thick cloud of black smoke
still no new pope and the subject is effectively changed
langdon and lt
chartrand the young swiss guardsman walk quickly down the row of hermetically sealed vaults in the vatican archives
langdons leading looking at the names on the outsides of each of the individual vaults
what are you looking for this time
i beg your pardon
artwork is valuable and corporations tend to keep track of their holdings
the catholic church is not a corporation signore it is a beacon a source of inspiration for one billion lost and frightened souls
sure sure i get that
he stops pointing up at a sign on the end of one of the vaults langdon contd but its also a bank
he takes one last breath of oxygen rich air pushes through the revolving door and comes through the other side eyes scanning the place
a moment later chartrand follows him through the door
langdon looks at him youre coming in too
cfmmander olivetti said i was not to leave your side this time
a mutter wasnt me it was her moving fast along the leather bound volumes langdon searches the place as fast as he can
a book drops onto a table pages flip by langdon studies it slams it shut
two more books flipped open compared pages rifled nothing
his hand finds a five inch thick ledger marked bernini
it smacks down and opens to the first page
langdon sits begins turning the pages one by one
his vision momentarily blurs
he rubs his eyes it clears again
he looks up at a vent over the doorway
thin ribbons flutter in the breeze of the minimal oxygen thats being pumped in
he goes back to work
chartrand watches him
looking out the window of the papal office we see the barricades removed from the edges of st
the crowds return
pulling back we see the camerlengo looking out at them thinking troubled
there are still half a dozen security officials in the papal office but the camerlengo turns and looks at vittoria working alone at a desk on the far side of
vittoria pores over the journals sent from geneva
sensing something she looks up
the camerlengo is standing over her
he speaks quietly
what sort of signs
the camerlengo looks over his shoulder to make sure their conversation is private
if the holy father were given an overdose of heparin
what signs would his body bear
bleeding of the oral mucosa
off his questioning look his gums
postmortem the blood congeals and turns the inside of the mouth black
even though he died fourteen days ago
it wouldnt show up until at least a week after his death
he looks around the room once more
then back to her
very important to me
he thinks for a long moment then please come
turns and leaves the room
she makes sure no ones looking then follows him out
she leaves the journals behind
close on the bernini ledger which langdon is now almost halfway through
he tiyrns a page scans the list of items written there then moves on to the next
he blinks his vision blurring again
he looks over at chartrand whos suffering even worse panting for air hands on his knees
you dont smoke do you
yes a lot a little bit
sit down before you fall down
chartrand half stumbles into a chair on the opposite side of the table
langdon goes back to what he was doing flipping a page and then immediately flipping it back
there is a hand written notation alongside one of the entries
langdon contd my italians no good what does this note say
next to the entry for the ecstasy of st
chartrand leans over the ledger squinting hard trying to focus
moved at suggestion of the artist
moved to another church
at bernini s suggestion
chartrand really suffering for air cant follow it
i dont know
langdon flips the page back to a photograph of the sculpture in question
is of a woman seemingly in the throes of ecstasy while an angel hovering over her holds a spear aloft
langdon raises an eyebrow
the word seraphim jumps up from the page words in quotes after it seraphim meaning the fiery one
more words pop out at us his great golden spear
filled with fire
langdon contd fire
still more woman inflamed by passions fire
and now a close up of her enraptured face
and now three things happen in quick succession langdon slams the ledger shut the ribbons on the air vent fall as the oxygen into the vault is cut off and
one by one all the lights in the archives go out
total silence for a moment
langdon and chartrand look at each other in the darkness
langdon contd the door
thats too bad
the camerlengo flanked by two swiss guardsmen escorts vittoria rapidly across the deserted floor of st
where are we going
to see my father
i dont understand
they circle past a pillar and she sees an orange glow up ahead seeming to emanate from beneath the floor in the center of the basilica
i was orphaned when i was nine years old
a bombing in madrid basque separatists protesting the visit of a catholic archbishop
as they draw closer she sees its the entrance to a sumptuous underground chamber surrounded by scores of glowing oil lamps
camerlengo contd the archbishop felt responsible and he adopted me the following day
i was raised by him and by the church
the camerlengo starts down a winding stairway rimmed by the lamps they descend lit by the spectral glow of the oil lamps
camerlengo contd he was the wisest man i ever met even with my youthful foolishness
he always saw the middle way
i wanted to be ordained but i also refused to be excused from military service
so he suggested i fly rescue missions helicopters bringing the wounded to hospital
he stops at the bottom of the stairs and looks up at her
camerlengo contd he was a great man
fourteen days ago
vittoria stunned realizes who hes talking about
emergency lights switch on in the vatican archives casting a weird reddish glow over everything
but the ribbons at the oxygen panel remain limp
below langdon pushes again and again on the deadened exit button trying to activate the doors
hes weak weaving barely on his feet
chartrands already slumped against a wall his radio in hand keying it over and over again but getting only static
chartrand gestures weakly around the room
langdon blinks his vision becoming seriously impaired
he holds his eyes closed for a moment opens them its not much better
langdon looks at the glass wall on the far side of the vault
then at the row of bookcases
gets an idea
he goes to the last bookcase which is about six feet from the glass wall
he hoists himself up on the shelf of the bookcase opposite it wedges himself in
and pushes with one leg
the giant bookcase teeters but just barely
langdon hoists himself further up gets both legs up against the bookshelf
pushes again more movement this time
now he puts everything he has into it straining like hell
the bookcase starts to tip goes just past the point of no return starts to fall gloriously headed straight for the glass wall which it slams into with enormous power
leaning against the wall
forget cracks theres not even a scratch
langdon curses under his breath looks around for another idea
he hears a soft thud from the other side of the room sees chartrand has slumped over unconscious
but his jacket has fallen open revealing the sidearm he carries in a shoulder holster
slips the gun out of the holster and hefts it
safe bet hes never held one of these before
he staggers over toward the glass wall raises the gun and pulls the trigger
trigger doesnt even move
after a moment of oxygen poor thinking he figures out how to click off the safety
the sound of the shot is barely audible to langdon
his brains going fast
if he was hoping to bring the whole wall down he failed but theres a faint hissing sound coming from the bullethole and he goes to it and takes a
deep breath of air from the outside
he stands back his brain clearing momentarily
seized by an idea he looks up at the wall at its four corners and at the tiny web of cracks radiating out from the hole he just made in
he raises the gun again and fires off four shots in quick succession
theyre in an odd pattern upper left corner upper right not quite as high lower middle left and the very lower right corner
now there are four new holes each hissing slightly and the first hole in the center
shaking his head once more to clear it langdon steps forward to the glass wall but instead of barreling against it or throwing a chair he simply raises one hand
places it flat over the first hole he made the one in the center of the glass wall and presses gently
almost immediately a sharp sound comes from the hole beneath his hand and a jagged crack leaps out from the first hole shooting up to connect with the hole in
the upper left corner
he presses just a touch harder and a second crack starts shooting down to the lower right
then a third and a fourth the glass is cracking like ice in springtime all four extremities connecting with the central hole and with a huge groaning sound the entire
glass wall falls to pieces at his feet
air rushes into the vault
and wouldnt you know it the power comes back on in the archives
vittoria the camerlengo and the two swiss guard reach the entrance to the holy vatican grottoes just as their power goes out
two flashlights click on and the guardsmen lead the way in
on both sides hollow niches line the walls
recessed in the alcoves as far as the flashlights let them see the hulking shadows of sarcophagi loom
on top of each tomb are life sized marble carvings of each pope shown in death and wearing full papal vestments arms folded across their chests
if the holy father was murdered the implications are profound
vatican security is impenetrable no one from the outside could have gotten anywhere near him
meaning it was someone on the inside
we can trust no one he steps up his pace taking the lead knows exactly where hes going
the others fall behind as everyone slowly realizes what he intends to do
and theyre not at all sure theyre up for it
the camerlengo closes the last few feet alone
he knees down in front of the bright marble carving a likeness of the late pope
you told me when i was young that the voice in my heart was that of god
you told me i must follow it no matter what painful places it leads
i hear it now asking me the impossible
give me strength
what i do i do in the name of everything you believe
the others watch as he finishes his private prayer stands and turns to them
camerlengo contd remove the covering
just stares at him
camerlengo contd did you hear me
signore by law we are at your command
but we are also bound by i ask your forgiveness for putting you in this position
vatican laws are established to protect the church
but it is in that very spirit that i command you to break them now
a moment of silence and then they step forward
set their flashlights on the floor
and step to the tomb
bracing their hands against the marble covering near the head of the tomb they plant their feet and push
it doesnt move
they push harder
vittoria and the camerlengo join them
with an almost primal growl of stone on stone the lid slides rotating off the top of the casket and coming to rest at an angle
the camerlengo picks up a flashlight and shines it in the crypt
vittoria leans forward
the light creeps up the popes body over his burial vestments past his folded hands and finally to his face
his cheeks have collapsed the popes mouth gapes wide and his tongue is black as death
the face of langdons mickey mouse watch is smeared with blood from a cut on his hand but we can still read the time
langdon and chartrand stagger down the front steps of the vatican archives where theyre immediately met by three vatican police cars
olivetti leaps out of one and meets them at the base of the steps holding his hands up in defense almost before langdon can lay into him
are you out of your minds
in the car
someone tried to kill me
do you know where the next church is
then get in the car
langdon jumps in the back seat of the car with olivetti and they squeal away from the archives
they continue as the driver tears through the streets of rome
we had no idea that you heard me ask permission
you assigned me an escort
dont try to tell me you didnt know i was in there
let me finish of course i knew but we had no idea that portions of our white zones are
olivetti contd cross wired with that building
commander rocher was extending the search if hed known the archives were on that grid he never would have killed the power
langdon looks at him evenly sees in olivettis eyes that they may be thinking the same thing
or there is the other possibility
olivetti doesnt answer
but hes thinking about it
langdon contd infiltration is the illuminati specialty why not the head of the swiss guard
i want to speak to the camerlengo
il camerlengo is unavailable unavailable
hes found evidence that the holy father was indeed murdered
he is seeking guidance
olivetti looks at him what are you an idiot
make an effort
vittoria escorted by the two swiss guardsmen from the grottoes returns to the papal office
she goes to the desk where she was sitting earlier to resume her examination of the journals
but the desk is bare
where are they
the guardsmen look at her blankly
vittoria contd who took the journals from this desk
the camerlengo in deep meditation slowly descends the stairs that lead to the sistine chapel
at the bottom four swiss guard in traditional garb guard the locked doors
the camerlengo reaches them
looks heavenward for one last word of encouragement and then unseal the doors
there is an audible gasp from the assembled cardinals as the heavy locks clunk open the chains rattle away and the main doors of the sistine chapel sweep open
the camerlengo walks in a stark presence in his black cassock amid the sea of red robes
cardinal mortati steps from behind the altar to meet him
signore do you realize that for the first time in vatican history a camerlengo has just crossed the sacred threshold of conclave after sealing the doors
there has been a development
olivettis alfa romeo races through the streets of rome trailed by three other cars
the camerlengo has just passed on the shocking news and the whispered word murder can be heard in several languages
even mortati is shaken
the camerlengo speaks to the cardinals
he strides quickly up the steps of the altar to address the group again to the shock and surprise of this most conservative and rule bound group
but no one stops him
camerlengo contd it is true we are under attack from an old enemy
and this time theyve struck from within murdering our holy father and threatening us all with destruction at the hands of their new god science
so what are we to do
close on the dashboard clock in olivettis car which now reads
langdon looks up from it staring intently through the windshield
on the horizon he sees a faint orange glow
the camerlengo continues and the cardinals are listening
since the days of galileo the church has tried to slow the relentless march of science sometimes with misguided means but always with benevolent intention
still they call us backward ignorant
camerlengo contd but who is more ignorant
the man who cannot define lightning or the man who does not respect its awesome power
through the windshield of olivettis car we see that orange glow closer now
its a building on fire
the camerlengo continues growing passionate
the promises of science have not been kept
were a fractured and frantic species moving down of destruction in the name of progress
the police cars come to an abrupt stop in front of the church of santa maria della vittoria
flames glow like evil eyes through the stained glass windows fifty feet above the ground
a small crowd has gathered stabbing at their cell phones
a siren wails in the distance
mortatis aide father simeon takes advantage of the open sistine chapel doors and slips inside
he takes a place just behind mortati as the camerlengo goes on
science and religion are not enemies
but there are things that science is simply too young to understand
we are here to lead but how
with three sharp cracks olivetti fires into the lock in the front door of the church
he kicks it open and flame rips out into the night air
the camerlengo speaks faster now
shall we cloak ourselves in silence and secrecy as in the past
or do we open the doors take down the blackened curtains and speak to our flock
olivetti langdon and four other vatican police make their way into the burning church
there is a massive pile of church pews in the center aisle burning wildly
the camerlengos wrapping up signores i ask no i pray that you break this conclave
open the doors
in the burning church two heavy incensor cables run from the walls of the church and rise above the burning pews at an angle strung tightly to a center point
langdon follows the wires up with his eyes evacuate st
the wires meet at a center point just above the roaring flames where tell the world the truth
the third cardinal still alive is suspended over the searing flames
a word is branded into the center of his bared chest
vatican police led by olivetti and vincenzo race into the building and draw their weapons
olivetti shouts to them in italian looking for a way to cut down the agonized cardinal
langdon races toward the pyre but is repelled by a wall of heat ten feet away
the cardinal screams and langdon looks to the sides following the cables that reach to the walls
one of the vatican cops ducks which is lit only by the wild orange flames
he creeps forward gun in front of him toward a fire extinguisher mounted on the wall
he reaches for it but a hand reaches for him from behind hes pulled off his feet and olivetti and vincenzo whirl as two gunshots come from the darkened side
they race toward it
langdon shouts to two more vatican cops pointing upward
the cleat on the wall
get something to stand on
hes pointing at a cleat maybe ten feet up on the wall where the right guide wire is attached
vatican cops drag a half burned pew out of the fire and pull it underneath leaning it against the wall for greater height langdon starts to climb it to uncleat
olivetti creeps forward gun at the ready vincenzo close behind him
they see a form on the floor in front of them and olivetti bends down its the first vatican policeman
dead in a pool of his own blood
vincenzo standing behind olivetti looks down horrified and in that moment of distraction a figure creeps up behind him and twists his head degrees with one smooth motion
olivetti whirls but his gun comes around a split second slower than he does and in that split second a shadow falls over him something slashes through the air and
langdon struggles to climb the pew thats leaned against the wall as vatican cop finds a long handled candle snuffer and races toward the edge of the fire with it
blinking back the intense heat he manages to hook the cardinals manacled foot with it he turns to langdon who stretched as far as he possibly can just manages to
loose the wire from its cleat holding tightly to it so as not to let the cardinal go into free fall
but the pew on which hes balanced starts to wobble then two gunshots thud into the chests of vatican cops who were supporting the pew
they fall the pew tips and langdon falling loses his grip on the chain
the cardinal falls toward the flames
vatican cop tries to pull him to safety but doesnt have enough of whirrs through the pulley until it reaches its the cardinal to an abrupt stop six feet lower
and directly in the middle of the bonfire
his shriek of agony echoes through the burning church
langdon slams to the floor just at the edge of the burning church pews maybe cracking a rib on the hard floor of the church
a figure steps out of the shadows looming over him langdon looks up expecting a gunshot but instead sees the bleeding figure of olivetti staggering toward him clutching his slit
throat in his last moments of life
vatican cop is desperately trying to pull the cardinal from the flames the end of the candle snuffer is now hooked around the cardinals foot he pulls him closer reaches
out can almost grab his ankle until he is shot in the back
he falls to the floor drawing and dropping his gun in the process losing his grip on the long handled pole as well
on the ground bleeding he sees his gun just a foot away from his hand
he reaches for it
and a foot steps on his wrist breaking it
gray stands over him implacable
we see mr
gray fire two shots into the ground where cop is lying
then he turns toward us
langdon still on the ground looks up at the sound of the shots
through the burning church pews he can see mr
gray starting toward him
langdon crawls on all fours through the outskirts of the bonfire toward a recessed part of the wall ten or fifteen feet away
gray steps up behind him raises his gun polizia
two more cops roman carbinieri have run into the burning church and are making their way down the center aisle straight toward him
gray raises his left non gun holding hand displaying a leather billfold with a badge in it
good italian accent gendarmeria vaticano
recognizing the id the two cops glance away for a second to search the rest of the church
gray blasts two shots into each of them
they drop dead but one of them squeezes off a single round before falling
gray looks down at his right shoulder where a dark red stain is spreading on his suit
he touches it more annoyed than anything
langdon has crawled as close as he dares to the raging fire and the sleeve of his shirt is ablaze
he rolls out the other side of the embers stamping out the flames gets to his feet and takes off running
gray pursues only slowing his gait slightly to double tap two shots into the head of a dying vatican cop
langdon hurls himself over a balustrade and into a chapel on the far side of the church
bullets shatter the glass of an elevated crypt three feet off the floor
inside is a superbly detailed wax statue of a saint in death
langdon dives under it and crawls backwards staring in horror at mr
grays feet as they approach the chapel from across the church
langdons back thuds into a wall
but theres an old wooden grating in the wall
he turns kicks it with both feet
the grating crunches into pieces revealing a narrow crawlspace langdon army crawls through it
grays face appears in the entry to the crypt
he pauses to change clips on his handgun the floor beneath langdon abruptly runs out mr
gray raises his gun and langdon disappears
the gunshots thud into cement wall where he was not where he is
langdon crunches to a hard landing on a subterranean stone floor rolls over and sees mr
gray above him now pointing down
but theres another crawl space and langdon scurries into it
its hopelessly dark an even tighter space than the last one filled with cobwebs that langdon blindly claws his way through
he hits another hole in the floor falls a second time and lands on top of a pile of long decayed skeletons in the nearly black bottom of the churchs
underground warren of hiding places
he looks up
hes ten feet from the nearest handhold only a fool would follow him down here and mr
gray is no fool
he steps back over the balustrade and leaves the chapel
the waxen face of the carving in the sarcophagus melts in the intense heat of the out of control fire
in the salon outside the sistine chapel the camerlengo waits alone
from inside can be heard the sound of voices in debate
finally the big doors open and cardinal mortati emerges goes to him
god answers all prayers
he puts a hand on the camerlengos shoulder
mortati contd but sometimes the answer is no
the camerlengo closes his eyes this is a terrible terrible mistake
the college will not break conclave
we cant hide this anymore
the burning church a despicable act of terrorism
father simeon will make a suitable announcement lamenting the loss of life
may i suggest you direct your energies to helping the swiss guard confront the possibility of this explosive device and leave church leadership he gestures to the open doors to
the sistine chapel and the assembled cardinals within
mortati contd to its leaders
the camerlengo looks at him for a long moment then turns and wa ks away
father simeon who had been lurking in the open doorway to the chapel now glides up beside him and touches mortatis arm
there is a growing fear that without the four prefiriti a two thirds majority for any candidate may be impossible
unless he trails off gestures vaguely
it is the recommendation of many that you ask to be removed from your post as great elector mortati raises an eyebrow seeing where this is going
simeon contd thereby making yourself eligible to wear the ring of the fisherman
mortati looks at him for a moment then looks back over his shoulder where a small knot of cardinals who have clearly discussed this are looking at him in confirmation
if it is gods will may his will be close on a handwritten page half filled with mathematical computations the other half with a scratchy handwritten prose
if were eagle eyed well notice the phrase we move past just as we cut into the scene is may his will be done the same phrase we just heard
commandante rocher is at his desk vittorias leather bound journals on the desk in front of him
hes studying them carefully and seems troubled by what he reads
through the glass walls of his office we can see a commotion in the still chaotic swiss guard headquarters
someone is walking toward us briskly a womans voice complaining loudly in italian
rocher calmly places the journals on top of the screen of the video monitor inlaid in his desk the one we saw earlier with a keyhole where a power switch
he pushes a button and the monitor rotates shut into an inlaid panel in the desks surface
it closes just after those journals are private property
vittoria arrives in the doorway livid
vittoria contd i demand that you return them to me
no attempt at a they are material evidence in a vatican investigation
i am an italian citizen and i have a right to
this isnt italy
it isnt even rome
the vatican is its own country with its own laws and when those journals crossed our border they became our property
you will get them back when i have decided they contain nothing of value to this investigation
she looks at him then down at the desk where the outline of the hidden panel is visible in the veneer of the wood
do you have something to hide commandante rocher
do you doctor vetra
he stresses her title as if it offends the burning church now mostly extinguished
but a large crowd has gathered along with a dozen police and fire vehicles
as firemen put out the last of the flames not using water but halon gas which creates no steam a metallic tapping sound comes from somewhere
one of the firemen approaches another gets his attention stop what youre doing and listen
they shut down a hose and stop listening
there it is again
they shout in italian to the others now everybody shuts down their hoses and listens
the metallic tapping echoes in the smoldering church
they walk toward it its coming from an oval plate in the floor like a manhole cover heavy and carved
weve seen one of these before it leads to a demons hole
the tapping is louder now rhythmic
somebodys down there
crowbars are produced the cover of the demons hole is pried off and shoved aside revealing
robert langdon wedged into the top of the opening holding a rock in one hand as he clings precariously to the walls he has climbed
strong hands reach down haul him to his feet and those same feet hurry to the front of the smoldering church coming to a stop in front of berninis ecstasy
the statue he came here to find
now as the italian speaking police and firemen work around him langdon moves as if in his own world
he looks to the statue repeating fragments of the poem he has by now memorized let angels guide you on your lofty quest
directly over the recumbent saint against a backdrop of gilded flame hovers berninis angel
the angels hand clutches a pointed spear of fire
langdon contd cross rome the mystic elements unfold
langdons eyes follow the direction of the shaft arcing toward the right side of the church
a roman policeman a member of the carbinieri comes up to langdon discussing him in italian with two other cops as he approaches
langdon is it
langdon ignores him pointing at the wall instead
what direction is that
west i think
langdon weve confirmed with the vatican that they invited you into this investigation but what i
as if by command a map crinkles out on the floor of the church
its detailed a fire department map and langdon drops down on all fours studying it
langdon whips a glance over at the angel gets bearings and rotates the map to match
his finger travels over the map and we watch as his finger crosses church after church after church tiny black boxes with crosses in them
there must be two dozen
he sits back for a moment
the roman cop bends down next to him
treats him like a crazy person
professor i need to know what you saw here
fire and death
show me where santa maria del popolo is
the cop doesnt the church it was the first altar of science
the cop points to a spot at the top center of the map
langdon contd and st
the cop points to a spot at the bottom center
langdons eyes widen he grabs the cop by the lapels and pulls a pen from the mans pocket
he turns back to the map and draws a straight line from north to south connecting the two churches the cop just pointed to
langdon contd and were over here he puts the pen on a point on the eastern side of the map
langdon contd and west is he draws a line straight across the map to the west sucking in his breath as he realizes something
langdon contd cross rome
now he stands slowly and as he stands we rise up to get a birds eye view of the map on the floor
on which he has drawn a perfect cross
langdon contd its a cross
the poem meant it literally
the four altars of science form a perfect cross
the cop who has no clue what hes talking about gets a call on his radio and turns away to take it
langdon contd muttering to himself which means the fourth element water should be right about he drops to his knees again and traces the horizontal line to where it stops
on the western side of the city exactly as far from the center line as was the church on the eastern side
langdon contd here
behind him professor i am asked to escort you to the vatican immediately
commander rocher has asked to see you
ignoring him water
as langdon peers down we see the line on the map comes to a stop in the center of a place called piazza navona and as we go in closer
on the map an odd shaped object in the middle of the piazza starts to move to ripple right there on the map and we hear the sound of running water as it slowly dissolves to berninis spectacular fountain of the four rivers in the piazza navona
there is a black van parked beside the fountain and we drift over toward it
passing through the passenger window we go inside to find mr
gray facing the rear of the van his jacket off and his shirt open engaged in battlefield surgery on his injured right shoulder
using a long handled tweezers he digs into his own flesh gets a hold of the bullet that pierced him and tosses it onto the metal floor of the van
with a ting
it lands beside a lumpy tarp and as metal hits metal the tarp jumps
theres a human being in there
gray speaks to the lump
were it up to me it would not be this way
it is a sin to kill with pain
but i am a sinner
we pan off him quickly and look out the drivers window up at a clock tower on the far side of the plaza
its sixteen minutes to eleven
langdon hurries down the steps of the still smoldering church followed closely by the roman cop and two other cops
the vatican insists that
turning on him the vatican is about to see its fourth cardinal murdered tonight
he realizes he spoke too loudly and there is quite a crowd assembled outside the smoking church
langdon lowers his voice and presses in
langdon contd now you can either do what they tell you and force me to go to the vatican where we can all mourn his death together or you can
show them how real cops act and take me to the piazza navona where we might be able to stop it
the cop looks at him thinking confers with another cop in rapid italian
langdon checks his watch
langdon contd by all means talk it over
but in fourteen minutes hell be dead
peters square is even more crowded than before
another move down the row of international television reporters but this ones about twice as fast as the last one
anybody not speaking english is subtitled
possibility of terrorism as the church has now confirmed arson at one of its oldest and holiest churches moving on to an asian reporter resulting in at least six confirmed
deaths to a brazilian initial rumors that one of the dead was cardinal ebner of frankfurt to an american
been refuted by the vatican which has asked international media not to engage in quote wild speculation and to a french woman as conclave goes on with no sign of
agreement on a new pope yet
in the papal office the camerlengo sits alone in front of the fireplace staring into the flames thinking
behind him a small knot of swiss guard debate their next move in italian
he speaks softly to them in italian subtitled
at if the church is still in peril give the order to evacuate the cardinals
but with dignity let them exit into st
peters square with their heads held high
i dont want the last image of this church to be frightened old men sneaking out a back door
if cardinal mortati protests escort him bodily
do you understand
the guardsmen are uncomfortable with that idea
if you think it is the right thing signore
im certain its the wrong thing and i will be removed from my post for it
but i also know we have no choice
they just look at him
youre the boss
camerlengo contd please clear the room so that i may pray on the matter
they get out
he stares into the flames
piazza navona is lightly peopled on this soft summer night with so much attention directed toward the vatican
the hood of a car glides into view nearly silent on the far side of the fountain
langdon and the two roman cops step out and survey the area
langdon looks to the fountain
its central core is twenty feet tall a rugged mountain of marble with caves and grottoes through which water churns
atop it stands an obelisk that climbs another forty feet
eyes searching let angels guide you
but theres no angel anywhere
he turns to the first roman cop
langdon contd isnt there an angel on this fountain
the markers no good without an angel pointing to the final blame mussolini
he wanted it for his summer but the cop stops mid sentence as he notices the black van parked on the far side of the fountain
silently the cops gesture to each other to go opposite ways around the fountain and to langdon to stay where he is
langdon frustrated but no action hero watches them as they slowly encircle the van
the first cop approaches the drivers window sees mr
gray sitting implacably behind the wheel
he taps lightly with a knuckle his drawn gun at his side just out of view
gray opens the window
the roman cop looks down ever so briefly at a small spreading bloodstain on mr
when he looks back up there is a silenced pistol pointing directly at him
he takes a bullet in the forehead slumps forward against the window and we see his body pulled rapidly into the van through the drivers window
whole thing took about three seconds
diners at an outdoor cafe dont even notice
on the other side of the fountain the van rocks slightly but he cant see anything out of the ordinary
he turns looks to the second cop who is just now approaching from the rear of the van
this ones got his gun in front of him hes ready for anything
we creep around the back of the van with him and just as he comes around to where he can see the drivers side the barrel of the silencer presses
into his forehead
a quick exchange in italian per favore
another bullet another slumping cop and the van rocks again but he cant see anything more detailed than that
all he knows is the two cops arent coming out from the other side of the van something is going on
and the bell in the clock tower starts to bong
the sliding door on the fountain side of the van slams open revealing the figure of the fourth cardinal wrapped in chains and with manacled hands and feet
he thrashes against the iron links but the chains are too heavy
one of the links bisects his mouth like a horses bit stifling his cries for help
gray hovers over him
langdon gasps and mr
gray shoves the bound figure roughly out of the van
the cardinal rolls falling into the fountain with an enormous splash
his weighted body sinks immediately to the bottom
there is a moment frozen in time in which langdon locks eyes with mr
gray still hunched in the back of the van as the clock tower continues to bong the only sound we can hear
langdon looks at him then down at the body in the fountain then back up at mr
gray who salutes him the van door slams shut and the van tears ass out of there
langdon looks from its receding taillights to the idling police car its door hanging open he could jump in and give chase but then his eyes go back to the
fountain where the drowning cardinal must not have much time left and its really no decision at all
langdon covers the distance to the fountain in two quick strides and leaps in
the water is waist deep and like ice
steady streams of bubbles rise up from the bottom churning it
langdon reaches the body of the cardinal plunges in and struggles to get both arms underneath the drowning man
through the watery haze we can see the mans bare chest branded with the final ambigram
langdon struggles to lift him but the weight is too much he can barely get him a few inches off the bottom of the fountain much less all the way
to the surface
langdon running out of air bursts to the surface and on the takes a deep breath then plunges back but he still cant move the cardinal
he makes eye contact with the dying man who seems to be accepting his fate maybe even welcoming it
langdon changes his grip strains like hell and actually gets him a few inches higher this time but nowhere close to the air supply
but with the new position his eyes fall on something behind the cardinal a plastic tube six inches across streaming bubbles into the fountain
he goes back takes another breathy and sees the fountain of bubbles rising up to the surface just above the tube
several passers by notice the commotion in the fountain as langdon dives back under the water
langdon drags the body of the cardinal a few feet across the bottom of the fountain and rips the tube free from its mooring pulling it to the cardinals mouth
he clamps it down over the mans lips and the cardinal sucks a few greedy breaths from it
enough to keep him alive
langdon takes the tube and draws a couple breaths of his own then digs his hands back underneath the cardinal to lift him but this time six more hands come
in from all sides
several passers by have jumped into the fountain to help and as they all strain together
the cardinals bound body breaks the surface and he gulps deep lungfuls of air
he is saved
langdon sags against the side of the fountain exhausted and freezing as the others pull the cardinals body to safety
in the distance sirens
langdon gathering himself goes to the cardinal speaks in rapid spanish subtitled
the church of illumination
its where you were being held isnt it
guidera nods weakly as around them it seems like everybody arrives at the fountain carbinieri swiss guard vatican police paramedics car after car after car
langdon contd still to guidera where is it
close on a row of weapons in a cabinet in the office of the swiss commander rocher selects a pistol and slips it into a harness
while his back is turned to the room lt
chartrand the young swiss guardsman who escorted langdon to the archives hurries up behind him
langdon says cardinal guidera will be killed in piazza navona
hes on his way there with two carbinieri
send everyone we can spare
he closes and locks the cabinet heads for the door
staying here to continue the search for the explosive
chartrand looks back at the weapons cabinet
sees the space from which the pistol was taken
we fly over a bridge flanked by a dozen angel statues standing sentinel on either side leading directly toward the castel santangelo castle of the angels its ancient stone ramparts
lit by floodlights
soaring swiftly up its facade we close in on a mammoth bronze angel standing atop the citadel
it points the way all right its sword aimed directly downward at the castle itself as if to say youve found it
several police cars come to a stop in front of the castle at the same time
langdon climbs out the back of one just as vittoria gets out of a car driven by a swiss guardsman
langdon grabs her thrilled to see her
youre all right
im all right what about you
cold and wet but alive
i dont know
he took the journals hes hiding something
more cops arrive and a security guard is pressed into service behind them opening the massive front doors to the castle this is it
the church of illumination is somewhere in the castle
cops pour into the courtyard of the castle
langdon and vittoria follow
they dash around the outer bulwark of the castle
the courtyard beneath them looks like a museum of ancient warfare catapults stacks of marble cannonballs fearful contraptions
as the cops quickly and silently search every nook langdon and vittoria follow closely
the vatican used this place for centuries as a hideout a prison for enemies of the church there are passages and catacombs everywhere
it makes sense the illuminati infiltrated the churchs own stronghold
bernini was chief architect here he left clues everywhere its even surrounded by a pentagonal park
they reach the central core of the castle
another angel statue similar to the one atop the citadel stands in front of them its sword held in the same position pointing downward at an angle
langdon studies it follows the line of the angels sword and sees a gated drive that cuts across the courtyard itself
langdon contd there
he and vittoria are down in the courtyard at the mouth of the gated drive
the gate is open and leads to a tunnel a gaping entry in the central core
commanders on horseback used them to ride directly into a castle from the outside
he gestures to the nearby cops who are already on it and they all head into the darkened tunnel
police flashlights switch on and their beams bounce crazily off the walls of the tunnel
footsteps crunch as they all press in langdon and vittoria content to let men with guns lead the way
it gets darker as they descend and then by the echo of their footfalls they can tell theyve entered more lights are switched on illuminating the space which terminates in
three stone walls
its a dead end
but the police attention is focused on the black van parked in the center of the room
roman police snap into action flashlight beams bounce everywhere guns point in every possible window of the van shouts for whoevers inside to get the hell out now now now
the doors are flung open
the van is empty
except for the two dead policemen from the piazza navona
the police frenzy reaches an even higher level urgent messages passed along on radios half the cops turning and heading back out of the tunnel
langdon contd where are they going
vittoria listens to the orders being given in italian
back to search the outer castle
no it has to be here
but theres no stopping the cops and the only two that remain are posted outside the van guarding their fallen colleagues
robert its a dead end
langdon walks forward to the stone wall at the end of the tunnel and feels his way along it
it joins smoothly with the wall on the right side
vittoria contd robert
but he waves her off this has to be it
he feels all along the wall toward the other corner and as he looks down at the ground his eyes widen
bring a flashlight
vittoria borrows a flashlight from one of the two remaining cops who now get a crackly message on their walkie talkies and race out of the tunnel toward the top
leaving langdon and vittoria alone in the dead end
she brings the light to langdon who shines its beam down at the floor
there in the corner is a granite block
langdon contd none of the other blocks are granite
and theyre all square
he bends down looks closer
langdon contd this ones a pentagram
it points sure enough the block is carved in the shape of a pentagram with the tip pointing into the corner
langdon contd at nothing
but as he shines the light theres something off about the shadow it casts in the corner of the room
it creates an odd dark slit
langdon crouches in the corner and slides his hand along the back wall of the chamber
when he reaches the point at which it should intersect the side wall
his hand disappears
langdon contd the walls overlap
he flattens himself against the back wall shining the light straight at what should be the intersection of the walls
half the flashlights beam falls on the side wall and the other half shines through into the secret passage behind the wall
langdon draws in his breath and forces himself through the tiny slit just wide enough for a determined person to squeeze through
they look ahead shining the light
theyre in an extremely narrow passageway
they start carefully down it flashlight in front of them
do you still have the gun
you told me to give it back
she pulls the gun from her waistband
vittoria contd i ignored you
ignore me any time you like
to their right they pass half a dozen tiny jail cells the iron bars on most eroded away
several of the larger cells are intact and on the floor of one they see black robes and red sashes
they approach an iron doorway in the wall
the door is ajar and beyond it there is some sort of passage
langdon squints at two words above it ii passetto
vittoria gestures that way
langdon shakes his head no
langdon contd leads to the vatican
or from it
an ancient escape route
they round a corner where the tunnel takes a ninety degree turn to the right
at the corner langdon notices another pentagrammal block in the floor
he bends studies the direction its pointing feels the wall langdon contd another overlap
and finds another overlapping angle this one even smaller than the last
the wall is actually joined at the floor seems to open out at the middle in roughly the shape of a human form turned sideways and joins again at the
and finds himself at the base of a set of steep spiral stairs
langdon looks up to the top of the stairs
there is an archway adorned with a tiny carved angel
vittoria slips through the gap sees the carving too
langdon sensing theyre close starts up the stairs
commander rocher eyes dead set walks down a hallway in the apostolic palace
he passes two swiss guardsmen with radios
get on the radio and put the word out
conclave is to remain sealed
but the camerlengo gave the order for evacuation at eleven fif im countermanding it
that door stays shut
do you understand
rocher keeps walking
langdon and vittoria creep into the church of illumination and we get our first good look at it
the embellishments though faded are replete with familiar symbology
we have thirty minutes left i can still change the battery if we can find the cannister
langdon nods but hes fascinated by the place
in the center of the room there is an open fireplace its embers still smoking
the four illuminati brands their faces wiped clean have been placed back in a molded velvet case
langdon fascinated spots an empty slot in the very center of the case surrounded by the four used brands
but this ones missing
vittoria arrives over his shoulder having completed a quick search of the place
vittoria contd it isnt here
theres a fifth brand
he touches the indentation in the velvet puzzling it out
two crossed keys
the symbol for the vatican
theyre going to kill him
before they blow up the vatican theyre going to kill and brand the pope himself
but there is no pope
technically there is
we have to please place your gun on the floor
vittoria looks at langdon who nods youd better do it
gray contd now turn around
they turn and face mr
he looks quite dapper and not too much the worse for wear
there is a briefcase on the ground beside him and hes changed into a fresh shirt
gray contd kick it to me
he picks it up ejects the clip and the round in the chamber pockets them and tosses the gun into the smoldering fire
you could have been long gone by now
some do gods work for love others for money
which do you take me for
as if to answer his own question he picks up the briefcase from the floor beside him
then studies langdon for a moment
youre not one of them
neither are you
i was expecting a fanatic
when they call me and they all call me it is so important to them that i know what they ask is the lords will
or allahs or yahwehs
and i suppose theyre right
because if he were not vengeful i would not exist would he picks up his briefcase
gray contd be careful
these are men of god
he turns to go
langdon cant help himself why didnt you kill us when you had the chancer vittoria looks at langdon like hes nuts
gray turns back seems puzzled by the very thought
because no one asked me to
langdon and vittoria pause for a moment look at each other weve got to get to the vatican
rocher reaches the office of the pope
two uniformed swiss guard are stationed outside
another swiss guardsman steps out of the office reporting back from within
the camerlengo says he will grant you an audience
id like to see him alone
the swiss guards look at each other
thats impossible sir
no one have you forgotten who you work for
rocher is truly intimidating when he wants to be
he nods to the other guards who raise their swords allowing access
vittoria and langdon barrel down the stone stairs into the passage and through the open doorway to il passetto
the passetto is narrow and dark lit only by streaks of moonlight coming through the vertical slits in the walls
but up ahead theres light
they race for it
the camerlengo kneels in prayer in front of the fire
he hears a sound behind him and turns as the door to the papal office opens
rocher enters closes and locks the door behind him
have you come to make me a martyr
vittoria and langdon race up a flight of stairs and the passetto comes out into the open for a hundred yards or so as it leaves the castel santangelo
ahead they see a rope ladder over the side
they look down
directly below them mr
gray is getting into an alfa romeo parked discretely at the end of a dead end street making his escape
the car door slams
gray turns the key
langdon and vittoria are running toward the vatican again when the explosion rips through the still night
they stagger and turn back in time to see mr
grays car go up in an enormous fireball
men of god
langdon grabs her arm and they take off
the passetto descends again into another underground space
the outline of a steel gate looms ahead blocking their way
but as they draw closer they find the ancient lock hanging open and the gate swings freely
this tunnel has been used and recently
they plow onward and now there is a low roaring sound from above them
langdon pauses looks up
were under st
they keep on
in the hallway outside the popes office there are raised voices from behind the closed door
chartrand approaches nervously
he and the guards look at each other dont know what to do
from the other direction father simeon cardinal mortatis aide strides toward them
i demand to speak to the camerlengo
an angry shout from behind the door draws their attention what the hell is going on in there
langdon and vittoria hit another gate this one heavier but it too is unlocked
the sound of st
peters square fades behind them now
they turn a corner and without warning the tunnel ends
there is only a thick iron door and as langdon searches it with his flashlight he finds no handle no knob no keyhole no hinges
a one way portal the only access is from the other side
with a roar of anger he starts to pound on the door
vittoria joins in
close on a watch
outside the door to the popes office lt
chartrand is desperate
while father simeon attempts to argue with him in italian chartrand turns hearing the pounding coming from down the hall
he heads toward it rounds a corner and steps into the popes private library where the pounding is louder
he steps to a heavy door in the wall looks unused for a century but its clearly the source of the sounds
he looks down sees three keyholes in the door and an ancient key in each of them
chartrand puts his ear to the door hears voices and on the other side langdon and vittoria squint at the light as the heavy door is hauled open before them
chartrand looks at them in amazement howd you get here
the camerlengo is in danger
chartrand langdon and vittoria round the corner and race down the hallway toward the popes office just as a bloodcurdling scream comes from behind the closed doors
the swiss guard move fast throwing open the door
langdon and the others race into the popes office and find a truly bizarre scene
rocher is near the fireplace brandishing his sidearm aimed at the camerlengo who lays on the floor writhing in agony
his cassock is torn open and his bare chest is seared black
a large square brand is on the floor at rochers feet
two of the swiss guard act without hesitation they open fire
two bullets slam into rochers chest and he crumples
father simeon bursts into the room and as he does the camerlengo rolls over onto one side points his index finger at simeon and cries out a single word you
you sanctimonious he rushes at the camerlengo and chartrand reacts on instinct putting three bullets in father simeons back
he falls to the floor dead
chartrand and the guards dash to the camerlengo who clutches his chest convulsing in pain
langdon walks toward him stunned as the guards pull the camerlengos hands away from his wound revealing the fifth brand
the crossed keys seared into the flesh of his chest
langdon looks at rocher in utter disbelief
rochers still alive trying to say something holding out a hand
everyone else in the room is focused on the camerlengo so langdon bends down takes the dying mans hand
rocher looks up at him desperation in his eyes trying to communicate something but too weak to say more than for safety
and his eyes close
langdon withdraws his hand from rochers and finds the dying man has pressed something into his palm
langdon looks at it and it gives him a thought
he turns looks at the camerlengo whose chest is exposed
the crossed keys are indeed branded there but theyre upside down
langdon slips the key in his pocket and approaches the camerlengo as chartrand gets to his feet on his radio
i need a medevac to st
peters square right now
the camerlengo struggles to a sitting position
order the evacuation
we only have nineteen minutes
theyre upside down
you think its a sign
everything has been a sign why should this be any different
he looks at rocher dead on the floor
back at the branded keys
langdon contd crossed keys the symbol for the papacy upside down
the first pope he was crucified upside down on vatican hill
right beneath where were standing
upon this rock i will build my church
or bring it down upon itself
he looks back at rocher and at father simeon dead on the floor
langdon contd they were conservatives the former pope was becoming more and more liberal
maybe they loved their church so much they were willing to destroy it
thinking repeats upon this rock i will build my church
peters tomb is the very core of christendom
the bomb is in st
almost admiring it the ultimate infiltration
i can still change the battery if we hurry
the square is more crowded than ever and now the helicopter
chartrand called swoops in low overhead as vatican police frantically try to clear a landing area
langdon vittoria the camerlengo and two swiss guard are hurrying across the deserted floor of st
peters basilica when the lights go out
the grid is still cycling the power to this section must be down
they race down the center aisle to the candlelit balustrade which surrounds the winding staircase into the grottoes
they do and run down the center stair
on the staircase the ninety nine burning oil lamps throw exaggerated shadows on stone walls
whats down here
city of the dead
the camerlengo drops to his knees and opens an iron grate in the marble floor
vittoria langdon the camerlengo and chartrand drop down through an open hole and into an underground city of ancient winding streets
part museum part ruin they run past ancient structures some hundreds some thousands of years old
the rectangular tombs are similar to little houses complete with doorways thresholds windows and terraces
the camerlengo seems to know exactly where hes going he leads them down a narrow stone passageway
they hurry up a small hill
at the top of the grade there is a stone grotto toward which the camerlengo is racing
he reaches the grotto searches but finds nothing
langdon and vittoria come to a stop behind him breathing hard
it must be here
it must be
he rips aside some protective tarps finds that underneath the actual burial site is an underground area part of a dig in progress
he climbs down into it we see just the top of his head as a soft glow seems to emanate from beneath him
the camerlengos head is wreathed in light for a moment and then as he climbs out we see that hes holding in his hands the glowing canister of anti matter
vittoria drops to her knees a tiny silver pellet in one hand two wires leading from opposite ends of it
set it down flat
the camerlengo does
langdon bends close
vittoria checks the timer
vittoria contd we still have seven minutes
she leans down reaching for the canisters baseplate
as she does a drop of sweat rolls to the tip of her nose she freezes
wipes the sweat away thinking about it vittoria contd its hot down here
heat decreases battery life
we may have less than five minutes
if i pull the power with less than five minutes the residual charge wont hold suspension
we should leave it and get clear if we can
at least if it goes off down here the damage will be and with that he snatches up the canister and takes off running back the way they came
but hes already gone around a darkened corner
peters square the helicopter that was brought in for the camerlengo waits propellers spinning
the crowd seems even bigger now and a reporter tells us why in st
peters square where despite a bomb threat and order of evacuation the crowd is actually growing in size as we await
the camerlengo emerges from the spiral staircase accidentally kicks over one of the oil lamps spilling its burning oil on the floor of the basilica
he ignores it racing for the front doors
langdon and vittoria come around a corner in the necropolis having taken slightly longer to find their way
langdon spots the circular entry by which they first came in
there it is
they race toward it and climb up
they hurry across the floor of st
peters basilica and burst out the huge doors that open onto st
peters square just as the helicopter lifts off
the crowd watches in amazement and the pilot stands in the square talking animatedly to two swiss guard gesturing toward the helicopter
but if hes not flying it
langdon looks up at the helicopter as it climbs straight upward
oh my god
the camerlengo is indeed at the controls of the helicopter piloting it upwards and away from the crowd below
the canister is beside him on the passenger seat
the crowd falls silent all eyes turning upward watching the helicopter recede into the clouds
the canister beeps on the seat beside the camerlengo still a few minutes left on its timer but the urgently flashing red power light cant be considered a good sign
the camerlengo looks at it
raises the crucifix from around his neck and brushes it against his lips
all eyes are upturned all voices have fallen still watching as the helicopters anti collision lights disappear into the clouded night sky
high above the square the helicopter still climbs rotating in circles
close on the canister as the red light flashes even faster and a shrill beeping fills the cockpit
in the crowd faces turn people point
theres something in the sky above them
langdon and vittoria see it too a faint white speck far up in the sky
this is the explosion
no the faint white speck is a billowing parachute and the camerlengo dangles at the end of it
the helicopter continues to climb far up into the night
and in the canister the beeping sound becomes continuous and the light winks out altogether
the shimmering bead of anti matter falls out of suspension and drops slowly toward the bottom of the canister it barely touches the surface and the helicopter explodes in a
blinding pinpoint of white light
up in the sky over st
peters square the pinpoint of light is tiny at first then it shoots out to either side in a searing white line then the white line balloons out on either
side expanding into a gigantic ball of hot white light
and then the sound hits
this is the explosion and it is so much more ferocious than we could have imagined
the entire image is bleached white with only the faint outlines of people visible within it
and then concussive force of the blast hits like heat waves rippling everything in its way
screaming and panic
the camerlengo clinging to the parachute is buffeted wildly spun over and over tangling him in his cords which makes him fall faster
the second wave of the blast comes and this ones ten times as powerful as the first
everything standing is flattened people camera trucks the fountain in the middle of the square collapses in a shower of marble and water
ceiling tiles fall and smash on the floor inside st
peters statues topple
the camerlengo falls unconscious now tumbling over and over dropping too fast
he slams off an angled rooftop headed for the ground
in the square langdon and vittoria dodge falling debris
vittoria loses her footing as a chunk of plaster crunches off a building plummeting toward her
langdon pulls her to safety as the plaster pulverizes itself in the square
the camerlengo crunches off the side of another building and drifts downward fast toward the crowd in st
his unconscious form smashes through a dozen people before slamming to the ground at one edge of the square
the blast suddenly turns inward on itself the heat and light and sound all seeming to suck back up into a perfect horizontal line which then collapses in from the
sides until once again it is just a speck of white hot light that disappears into the night
the only sound that remains in the square is a soft night wind
the wounded pick themselves up off the ground
the crowd realizing the blast is over turns its attention to the body of the camerlengo on the far side of the square
langdon and vittoria try to make their way toward him but the crowd surges past them and we soar over the heads of the crowd wanting to get there first
wanting to be the first ones to see his eyes open
a great cheer rises up from the crowd
the cheers from outside are clearly audible in the sistine chapel where the doors have been thrown open and they have gotten the news
a swiss guardsman runs in finds cardinal mortati
signore mortati he is alive
the camerlengo is alive
but he looks around him the cardinals have split into small groups theyre discussing something with great animation amongst themselves
mortati watches doesnt like what hes seeing
langdon and vittoria on a bench in the office of the swiss guard are having superficial wounds treated
the buzz in the office is intense just as excited as in the square and the sistine chapel
langdon looks over at vittoria
are you okay
she looks back at him nods
he reaches over interlaces his fingers with hers and takes her hand
langdon contd thank god
she smiles turns his hand noticing the glass on his wristwatch is broken
he notices seems distressed
do we have time for that story now
do i have someone to tell it to
she smiles and kisses the back of his hand yes
a roar comes from outside and we see the crowd in st
peters square in rapture
there is singing theres chanting of the camerlengos name
its exactly midnight
in the sistine chapel cardinal mortati is in hushed urgent conversation with a group of seven or eight cardinals
you are no doubt aware that by holy law the man is ineligible for election to the papacy
he is not a cardinal he is a priest a chamberlain
and there is the matter of his inadequate age
im sorry the protocols of conclave are not subject to modification
i will not call a ballot on this matter
the african cardinal who cast his vote earlier speaks up
but signore you would not call the ballot
surely you remember you gave up your post as great elector
mortati looks at him
boxed into a corner
outside the crowd in st
peters can be heard singing joyously
a second cardinal steps forward
they are singing in st
what happened here tonight transcends our laws
is it gods will that we abandon reason and give ourselves over to frenzy
discard the rules of the church
a third cardinal now a peacemaker perhaps they need not be discarded
they all look at him
third cardinal contd i am thinking now of romano pontifici eligendo numero
most of the cardinals look puzzled but mortatis face darkens
third cardinal contd balloting is not the only method by which a pope can be elected
there is another more divine method
acclimation by adoration
the second cardinal sparks to this idea
answering those around him who look confused election by adoration occurs when all the cardinals as if by inspiration of the holy spirit freely and spontaneously unanimously and aloud proclaim
one individuals name
and the law states that adoration supersedes all other eligibility requirements
the candidate need only be an ordained member of the clergy
they listen he must be present in the sistine chapel at the moment of election
many cries now of bring the camerlengo to us
mortati looks deeply troubled
bandaged now langdon and vittoria are ushered into rochers office by a swiss guardsman
please wait here while we arrange your transportation
may i get you anything
they shake their heads no thanks
settle into chairs to the side of rochers desk
they look uncomfortable its weird to be in a dead mans office
vittoria looks at his desk
thinks of something
she gets up and goes to it running her hand lightly over it
what are you doing
i want them back
she feels in the surface of the desk and finds the square outline of the inlaid panel where rocher hid the journals
she tries prying it open but that doesnt work she tries pushing down on the front of it and the panel slowly rotates open
the journals which were laid on top of the television monitor slide out and onto the desk
vittoria scoops them up and is about to close the panel again when wait a minute
he looks down at the monitor
at its odd key shaped on off switch
he pulls something from his pocket the key rocher gave him just as he died
he sees rochers face looking up at him dying for safety
langdon looks at the key and its odd shape
looks down at the monitor the same odd shape where its switch should be
theyre back in the popes office but rocher is alive and saying words he said earlier the holy father was subject to seizures
but he took steps
rochers voice continues over but langdon mouths the words as he remembers them rocher is back in the office again finishing his sentence for safety
langdon holds the key up repeating those last words for safety
he lowers the key to the monitor extending it toward the keyhole and its a perfect fit
he twists it
and with a zzzzt of power the monitor winks to life
an image comes into focus
is the papal office
on the monitor they are indeed looking at an image of the popes office
there are two dead bodies on the floor covered with sheets and vatican police are photographing everything
must be live
langdons figuring it out
the pope spent a lot of time in contemplation alone
if he was worried about seizures he must have asked rocher to install a camera without telling anyone
to keep an eye on him
and maybe he reaches down to the screen toward a touch panel at the bottom
you dont have to be a symbologist to understand these symbols play pause fast forward
langdon touches it
the image zips backwards rapidly to the shooting and the all the way back to when rocher and the camerlengo were alone together
rocher stands just behind him the camerlengo still kneels before the fireplace
as the image starts to play forward in real time we go in close on the monitor and come out in the papal office to watch the scene in person
the scientist kept journals
you figure prominently in them
the camerlengo turns his eyes back to the flames stirring the embers with a poker
leonardo wasnt just a physicist he was a catholic priest
deeply conflicted about the implications of his work and in need of spiritual guidance
about a month ago he requested an audience with the pope
but youd know that because you granted the audience and were present during it
the camerlengo twists the poker in the fire
the fool thought he had duplicated the moment of creation
and the holy father urged him to go public
his holiness thought the discovery might actually prove the existence of a divine power begin to bridge the gap between religion and science
the new god
ignore the weapons and chaos and madness
the camerlengo looks up at him and his expression is different than weve ever seen it
camerlengo contd his work was not religious it was sacrilegious
but you saw the popes position as a softening of church law
an old mans weakness
your fathers weakness
he raised me to protect the church
even from within
so you brought an old enemy back from the dead to frighten people
nothing unites hearts like the presence of evil
it didnt work father
it isnt finished
ive informed father simeon of what i learned and hell get word to the cardinals the moment conclave opens
the camerlengo looks at him calmly for a moment
i was planning on doing this alone
and then removes the poker from the fire
but it isnt a poker its a long handled brand with a cross of some kind at the end
rocher pulls his gun holds it at his side
put that down
the camerlengo rips open his cassock with his free hand
but perhaps its better that youre here
raising the gun put it down
but the camerlengo rams the red hot brand into the exposed flesh of his bare chest
his skin sizzles and smokes rocher shouts the camerlengo screams in agony and we know the rest the door bursts open swiss guard pour in rocher is shot father simeon
races toward the camerlengo you bastard
you sanctimonious and the camerlengo rolls over pointing one long finger at father simeon and crying out as we saw before lt
chartrand fires three times killing father simeon in his tracks we pull back the image turns to video again and as we complete the move out from the monitor we
see it isnt langdon and vittoria watching the image this time but cardinal mortati flanked by two other red robed cardinals and a half dozen swiss guardsman
langdon and vittoria stand to one side as mortati turns and looks at them
suddenly he seems very very old
the camerlengo escorted by two swiss guardsman descends the royal staircase that leads to the sistine chapel
though he is injured and limping he radiates confidence even benevolence a man certain this is the greatest day of his life
he approaches the chapel doors speaks to the swiss guard posted there as he approaches
i have been summoned by the college of cardinals
oh they know all about it
they lift their swords the doors sweep open the camerlengo strides boldly across the threshold and stops right there the look of imminent ascendancy frozen on his face
the cardinals are looking at him all right but not in joy not in wonder not for leadership
one hundred sixty one faces are turned toward his with an expression of utter condemnation
he stands there for a moment searching their faces trying to figure out what could possibly have happened
but it doesnt matter
and he knows they know
he takes two steps backwards almost involuntarily
starts to teeter balances himself in the doorway
then straightens himself smoothes his cassock
and turns and walks away back up the staircase
two swiss guard move to go after him quickly but cardinal mortati gestures to them
but within our walls
the swiss guard follow the camerlengo up the staircase
the camerlengo comes out of a doorway and into st
he heads for the main doors just as half a dozen swiss guard step in from outside blocking his way
some murmur softly into their radios
he stops turns around to come back the way he came but two swiss guard appear in that doorway also with radios
he turns again no way to go but toward the front of the basilica
he sees the candlelit balustrade near the front the one that leads to the grottoes and the necropolis
he picks up his pace
the swiss guard follow at a slight distance
the camerlengo reaches the spiral staircase and stops looking down seeing the oil lamp he kicked over earlier
he picks up a fresh lamp holds it to his face and blows out its flame with a soft puff
were with the swiss guard as they walk slowly toward him
but they hear a cry from ahead hes gone down the stairs a short distance and they can hear the sound of liquid sloshing
they break into a run as they realize what hes about to do theyre twenty feet away then ten then just close enough to see the camerlengo as he smashes
a burning oil lamp at his feet
the flames leap onto his oil soaked clothes and close on a bundle of one hundred sixty one slips of paper pierced by a needle and strung together
theyre tossed into the fireplace in the sistine chapel where they too burst into flame
we rise up again ahead of the smoke this time all the way up to
the chimney above st
peters square where the throng is still gathered waiting for some word as the sun rises on the horizon
and this time the smoke that billows from the chimney is white
there is a new pope
the crowd roars its approval bells begin to toll the red silk sash covering the doors to the papal apartment is sliced apart the wax seal breaks as the doors
are flung open and we st
peters square later the same day
the crowd if you can believe it is even bigger
a string of reporters fills us in for the last time non english speakers subtitled
church sources now confirm that camerlengo father sebastian guttierez has died of internal injuries sustained in his heroic fall which has spurred calls for his immediate canonization and sainthood
the vatican also announced the death of three of its cardinals in the fire at santa maria delia vittoria an american reporter but all eyes here are on the papal
balcony as we await the appearance of the new holy father who despite terrorist attempts at disruption we move off the reporter and up toward the papal balcony its doors hanging open curtains billowing
american reporter contd seems to have been selected in one of the swiftest and smoothest conclaves in modern church history
inside the papal apartments robert langdon sits stiffly on a straight backed chair in a hallway
couldnt look more uncomfortable if he tried
a swiss guardsman stands on either side of him
the door to his right suddenly opens another guardsman nods to him and langdon gets to his feet straightening his jacket
langdon is shown into the office where a robed figure is being dressed by two vatican attendants the clothes he dons are unmistakably papal vestments
the figure his back to us gestures to a nearby table
one of the swiss guardsmen goes to the table and picks up an envelope hands it to langdon
a token of thanks from his holiness
langdon puzzled opens the envelope and lets the contents fall into his hand
its a thin volume but a familiar one the only surviving copy of galileos diagramma
langdon nearly gasps
the figure in the papal robes turn around
it is of course cardinal mortati
this should help you complete your scholarly work professor
langdon is too stunned to speak mortati contd i ask only that in your last will and testament you ensure it finds its way home
i yes i of course
mortati takes a few steps forward studying langdon when you write of us and you will write of us may i ask one thing
langdon looks at him questioningly
mortati contd do so gently
religion is flawed mr
langdon but only because man is flawed
including this one
he touches his chest lightly
the aides now pick up the miter the spade shaped papal hat
he stands still while they place it on his head completing his attire
i hear youve chosen the name luke
there have been marks and johns but never a luke
its said he was a doctor
is that a message
science and faith all in one
the world is in need of both
science can heal or science can kill
it depends on the soul of the man using the science
langdon looks at him
likes the sound of that
youll lead wisely
im an old man
ill lead briefly mortati comes closer to langdon raises his right hand and makes a gentle sign of the cross over him murmuring softly
mortati contd thanks be to god for sending someone to protect his church
i dont believe he sent me father
oh my son
mortati contd of course he did
he turns and his aides part the billowing silk curtains that lead to the papal balcony
we move forward with him as he steps out over st
peters square and a great roar rises up from below
cardinal mortati pope luke i holds his arms out to his sides an embrace to take in the world and behind him hidden in the shadows of the papal apartment
just behind the billowing curtains robert langdon folds his hand in front of him and bows his head
