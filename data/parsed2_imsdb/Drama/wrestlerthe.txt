written by rob siegel over opening credits a montage of old wrestling magazine photos
action shots of randy the ram robinson taking on a keffiyeh wearing heel named the ayatollah before screaming fans at madison square garden
the sounds of a screaming cheering crowd overwhelm us
over the images ringside announcers boom commentary oh my
ram hit with a devastating piledriver
ive never seen a guy get fired into a buckle that hard
the ayatollah taking it to the ram outside the ring
ram absorbing tremendous punishment
how much more can he take
wait a minute
look at this
the ram is getting up
hes coming back
i dont believe it
randy the ram robinson giving absolutely everything hes got
this is the very definition of heart
just listen to this crowd
the entire garden people are on their feet
ram climbing to the top rope
the crowd going wild
they know whats coming
a photo of randy standing on the top rope his bent arms pressed against the sides of his head like rams horns
uh oh the horns are out
here it comes
we freeze on a final image of randy flying high above the canvas horns out poised to crash down on the ayatollah
over this the sound of the crowd going crazy
the def leppard song rings out as we
randy pushing still with the same long dyed blond mane sits on a bench in the boys locker room of a wilmington delaware high school
he pulls off his purple spandex wrestling tights
lime green rams horns run up the sides
theyre the same kind of tights as in the s pics and may well be the actual same pair
naked except for a jockstrap randy takes a breath
achy sweaty saggy exhausted
a battered warrior
scars all over his body
despite the rough shape hes in its clear hes just given it his all in the ring
he swigs down a few pills with a beer
promoter scott brumberg a heavyset man in a mets jersey with brumberg on the back approaches
great show ram
ya turned it out
a little sad as always
he hands randy some cash
randy counts it
its not much
i was sure the gated be bigger
randy just shrugs resignedly
randy changed into his street clothes limps out of the school each step labored and painful
waiting near the entrance are two fans both men in their s
think you could
fan holds out a sharpie and an old wrestling program from the s
on the cover is a shot of randy wrestling corporal punishment a heel in a drill instructor get up
randy takes the program happy to oblige
i was there
randy hands back the program
fan hands him a mini poster
the faded mid s poster features randy biceps bulging crushing a head of broccoli between his fists
across the top it says eat your vegetables punk
as randy signs my first match ever was you versus davey diamond at the spectrum
randy smiles a little
he remembers too
he hands back the poster
fan looks fondly at randy a part of his boyhood
vaguely sad you were awesome
randy nods a bit uncomfortably
the two fans muttering thanks drift off into the delaware night
randy is left standing alone still holding fan s pen
he walks over to a beat up old conversion van and climbs in
turns on the engine
music starts up on the stereo mid song
randy is driving
on the dashboard is an old action figure of himself from his wwf days
on the stereo a different song plays later in the same album
randy pulls into the entrance gate of paradise oaks trailer randy parks in front of his trailer
he gets out and heads toward it
a dismayed look comes over his face
randys pov the door is padlocked
he tugs on the lock
tugs on the door
he violently kicks the padlock in a moment of rage
randy resignedly climbs into the back of his van
randy lies on a scrunched up mattress on the floor unable to sleep
the van wall is decorated with a mini shrine randy has built to himself
old magazine and newspaper clippings mini posters etc
a few changes of clothes lie in a messy heap in the corner
he grabs a bottle of pills and pops a few washing them down with a beer
he closes his eyes trying to unwind
randy is asleep in his clothes from the night before
hes stirred awake by the sound of kids yelling and banging on the outside of van
he slowly sits upright massaging his pain wracked knees
every inch of him feels like shit
randys pov through the front windshield two year old kids boosted by two other kids are peering in
randy is playfully tussling with the four kids
he picks one of them up and bodyslams him
announcer voice oh my
he picks up another one and fake drops him on his head
he slams a third one
the kids are squealing with delight
randy sees a car drive up and park by the managers office
he watches it with interest
catch you maniacs later
the kids moan with disappointment as randy heads off
randy glares at len the trailer parks manager
dont be such a fuckin ballbreaker
youll get in when i get my rent
you know im good for it
youre good for it every time this happens
randy sigh groans in frustration
can i at least park in back
len looks at randy
a wave of pity comes over him
randy sits on a milk crate by his parked van
on the ground in front of him is a blender connected to an extension cord stretching to another trailer
he pours a protein shake packet into the blender
the trailer door opens
a woman comes out
lighting a cigarette she looks up at the cloudless starry sky
she gives randy a small you got it wave
randy enters a suburban shop rite
randy sticks his head in a door marked managers office
sitting behind a desk is store manager wayne
he looks up at randy irked
do we not know how to knock
wayne casually clicks a porn site closed on his computer
lets try that again
randy steps out and closes the door behind him
oh hi randy
what can i do for you
randy groans privately
he really hates wayne
do you have any extra shifts you could throw my way
whats the matter they raise the price of tights
randy is not amused
wayne grabs a looseleaf binder
lets see what we got
wayne starts flipping through
pretty much anything weekday
randy working alongside some mexican guys lifts a stack of boxes off the back of a boars head delivery truck
he carries the boxes through a rubber strip curtain into a walk in cooler
he puts them down and heads back out again
randy stands with gregg a huge bodybuilder whos counting off some bills
randy growls with displeasure at the small liquid filled glass bottle in his hand
angle on bottle the label says sustanon
the rest of the label is in spanish
im tellin ya bro its identical to the german
i tried mexican sus once

randy finds a bottle with german writing on it
thats my own stash

randy puts the bottle of mexican sustanon in the locker and walks off with the german
randy underwear pulled down plunges a needle into his ass cheek
randy is benchpressing
he grunts loudly as he squeezes out one more rep his spotter urging him on
push it out you got this
a strip mall tanning salon
randy breezes in nodding hello to the front desk woman whos on the phone
how ya doin glor
cupping phone hey babe
angle on an upright tanning pod
inside the pod randy is standing naked baking under the uv lights
randy sits in a chair as a korean lady wearing latex gloves bleaches his roots
his hair is full of plastic clips
dont leave it in too long
all those pieces broke off last time
okay okay no problem
randy is driving along route
once bitten twice shy is blasting on the stereo
one hand on the wheel he bangs out the songs piano riff on the dash with the other
he passes cheetahs a strip club
he keeps an eye on it as he drives past
the song fades out
he pops the tape out of the deck and tosses it on the passenger seat
on it is a messy pile of old cassettes
guns n roses
he sifts through the selection one eye on the road
randy is still driving
ac dcs back in black cranks loud
he pulls into the parking lot of a vfw hall and parks
a makeshift locker room staging area
randy and or so other wrestlers stand before the events sleazy tracksuit clad promoter nick volpe

third frankie cirillo and rob dynamo versus j
anvil and the ultimate freak
fourth teddy brewski and lex lethal
fifth samoan savages versus the disco brothers
sixth the irish warrior and vyper
seventh sandman steve sambuca versus hollywood
last but not least for the strap kid loco versus randy the ram
volpe walks off
randy sits alone a table toward the back
he takes a roll of athletic tape out of his supplies filled wheelie travel bag
he starts wrapping his knees and ankles
he does it in a slow methodical manner
it feels almost ritualistic
randy is hashing out the match with his opponent a wiry puerto rican kid whose shiny vinyl pants identify him as kid right there you post me
i show color
kid loco nods listening closely deferential to the legend
you post me again
kid loco nods youre fuckin whalin on my ass
randy turns and sees fellow wrestler lex lethal sticking his head into the cafeteria door
theres some chick out here looking for you
i dont think so
randy emerges from the cafeteria
a look of pleased surprise comes over his face
whats up kiddo
randys pov standing there in an otherwise empty hallway is a plain ish young woman
she looks at him with an unsmiling expression
this is stephanie
long time no see
randy pulls her in for a hug
she doesnt really hug back
she steps back breaking off the hug
a brief awkward pause
whatcha doing here

she shakes her head no
thats okay as long as youre not rooting against me
she is irked by his jokiness
is there someplace we can talk
im on in a sec
it wont take much of your time

stephanie gathers herself
this isnt easy for her
i came to make amends
im supposed to talk to people ive hurt
randy is puzzled for a moment
then it clicks in

im sure you mean that
she smile nods insincerely
sos that it
i need to apologize
for anything ive done or said over the years
all the anger at you
like the last time i saw you
im sorry for what i said
dismissive wave dont worry about it
stephanie is irked by his lack of engagement
she looks at him with suspicion
do you even know what i said
what did i say

vague flailing like how i was bad
you have no idea
randy turns and sees two meathead fans down the hall headed his way
randy the ram
meathead gives randy an excited high five
we gonna see some action tonight
sly grin tonights forecast calls for severe butt whoopins with a percent chance of pain
s from the meatheads
stephanie is pissed at the interruption
and even more randys embrace of it
could we get a picture
the two meatheads flank randy their arms around his broad shoulders
meathead looks tentatively at stephanie holding up his digital camera
think you could
she coldly takes it
she looks into the camera
the meatheads stick their tongues out and throw up devil signs
randy flexes theatrically making his best aaargh
stephanie snaps a shot
meathead takes back his camera
he and his buddy pat randy heartily on the back
thanks a lot yo

you know it broski
the meatheads excitedly head off
randy turns his attention back to stephanie whos glaring at him with cold disgust
same old shit
im in the middle of saying something important and you drop it for the fucking wrestling
i didnt ask them to come over
its like im all over again
are we almost done with this
she looks at him calmly
she walks off
randy smashing kid loco in the face with a flying drop kick
kid loco falls to the canvas
randy struts around the ring exhorting the crowd soaking up their cheers
distracted randy doesnt notice kid loco peeling himself off the mat
kid loco sneaks up behind randy and smashes him in the head
randy goes down
kid loco lifts randy up
theyre both on their knees chest to chest
kid loco steps to his feet lifting randy with him
kid loco tightens around randys arms arches his back presses out his chest and
he and randy fly with a lateral drop
randys head hits the canvas hard as he slams down on his back
as randy writhes on the mat kid loco heads for the randys pov kid loco is untying the turnbuckles padded cover
randy clutching his back discretely reaches into the waistband of his tights and pulls out a razor blade
he tucks the blade between two fingers in his cupped palm
kid loco heads back to randy
he picks up him by the hair and drags him to the turnbuckle throwing him head first into the exposed metal post beneath
randy clutching his smashed head discretely runs the blade along his hairline
no one sees it happen
blood streams down randys forehead
the crowds electrified
kid loco slams randys head into the metal post again
randy slumps over the corner ropes
kid loco cockily struts around the ring
look at this loser
angle on randy
the taunting stirs something in him
a look comes over him like hes bruce banner about to become the hulk
kid loco saunters back over to randy
he grabs his head for another post smash but he cant
randys neck and arm muscles bulge
his neck veins pop like hes suddenly super charged
a look of fear comes over kid loco
he knows the tide is about to turn
randy reaches over his shoulder and grabs kid loco by the hair
he pulls him in close
under breath lets go home
randy juts his hips back and bends over gaining the leverage he needs for a throw
kid loco shakes his head begging no
randy straightens his legs raises his lower back and yanks down on kid locos head
kid locos feet fly off the canvas as his head gets buried into the mat
he gets stuck upside down with his feet over the ropes
randy holding onto the top rope with both hands thrusts his knee into kid locos stomach
kid loco somehow manages to untangle himself from the ropes
he scurries away
randy goes after him
randy hits kid loco with everything hes got
he pours it on unstoppable
randy drags kid loco into the middle of the ring
he looks out at the crowd
randys pov a trio of fans are chanting
randy cups his hand to his ear
the chant quickly spreads
randy mulls it over
he looks at his laid out foe
he looks at the corner
he heads for the corner
randy climbs to the top rope
he looks around at the crowd like hes still undecided
randys pov the fans are cheering wild with anticipation
randy bends his arms pressing them against the side of his head like rams horns
just like in the photo in the opening montage
the leap is not terribly high or graceful
he crashes down onto kid loco horns first
kid locos whole body convulses
the fans lose it
this is what they wanted
the ram jam
the money shot
randy on a post match high sits on a cafeteria table enjoying a beer as a pseudo medic stitches up his hairline gash
nick volpe wanders over
ram man you popped that crowd
randy smiles contentedly
he sure did
got a sec
nick volpe comes over
for you needledick

randy looks at him unsure
randy racks his brains
he has no idea
th anniversary of you and ayatollah at the garden

randy sees an excited smile creep across volpes face
two words re

hundreds thousands of screaming fans watching you two make history for the second time

randys mouth is practically watering
a spring in his hobbled step randy gets out of the van and heads toward cheetahs the strip club he passed earlier
manning the door is big chris a huge bouncer doorman

yo big chris
they chummily shake hands
big chris pulls randy in tight
into randys ear hey can you get me any more of that igf

a crowded not very glamorous jersey strip club
randy stands over by the bar
the female bartender slides him a beer
randy takes a swig looking around the club
i think shes vip in
randy nodding takes his beer and heads over toward the stage
he settles in at an open table
a young stripper works the pole grinding lewdly to stuntin like my daddy a bass heavy dirty south rap song
randy watching her quickly grows bored
he finds the stripper like the song crude and soulless
randy is at the urinal
he flushes and heads over to the sink
he washes his hands checking his look in the mirror
he primps a little
randy exits the bathroom and heads back toward the table
en route he passes a curtained off vip room
trust me babe
youre gonna be happy
randy hearing this slows
we said the other one
with the belly chain
randy peeks through the curtain
inside he sees cassidy a sexy tattooed aging rocker chick in a white spandex dress
with her are six hair gelled goombah wannabe bachelor party dudes early s
the bachelor is sitting in a chair in the middle
sorry guys shes on break
well im sorry but we dont want you
how old are you anyway
youre like my moms age
stifled laughter from his buddies
randys anger builds as he watches
cassidy trying to salvage the gig straddles the bachelor
theres nothing like experience
into his ear seductive ive done things your little fiancees never dreamed of
yeah like graduate in
this cracks his friends up
randy bursts through the curtain
to dude apologize to this lady
everyone is taken aback including cassidy
who the hell are you

cassidy wedges herself between randy and dude
i got this
no its not okay
this is definitely not okay
he turns to the bachelor
i guarantee this womans times hotter than whatever goombah skank youre about to marry
to dude you hear what he just called gina
thats my fuckin sister
dude steps to randy chest puffed out
randy whips around and grabs the chair out from under the bachelor
he wields it menacingly at dude who backpedals terrified
randy makes like hes going to hit the guy with the chair
instead he flings it at the wall
what the fuck
the entire bachelor party rushes for the curtain
just like that theyre gone
randy looks at cassidy expecting a hearty thank you
instead he gets a pissed off shove
thanks a lot
that was bucks just walked out
randy is totally taken aback
i was just trying to help
did i ask for help
did i need help
randy looks down silent and sheepish
then dont fuckin help
cassidy calms down a little
she looks at him with a warm smile
good to see ya man
randy is getting a lapdance from cassidy
she plants her hands against the mirrored wall behind him her body just inches from his face
were talking one of the historic matches in history
another million and a half watching at home on pay per view
she turns giving him a nice view of her writhing behind
on the small of her back is an ac dc tattoo
we were going back and forth just killin each other for a half hour
any wrestling fan they know all about it
million and a half
yeah it was big
so a rematch
smiles contemplating the history all over again
cassidy turns around again
randy looks her body up and down savoring her curves as she dances just for him
goddamn you are smokin
cassidy smiles a little
this makes her feel good
my neck my back ends
cassidy pulls back on her dress and casually sits down next to him
a new song comes on
they look toward the stage where a puerto rican stripper shakes her ass to the staccato abrasive latin rap song
i put on a good show
cassidy nods supportively sincerely
could be the thing that gets me back on top
you never know whos in that crowd
an alarmed look comes over cassidys face
randy follows her eyes to his hairline
a small amount of blood is trickling down from his stitches
he grabs a cocktail napkin and casually dabs it
got cut tonight
ah its nothing
small chuckle and they say wrestlings fake
randy proudly holds out his arm
hows this for fake
cassidys pov a long ish scar on randys bicep
whats that from
billy bob banjo hit me with his two by four
loose nail tore the bicep open
i got even better
he pulls down his shirt collar revealing a nasty collarbone
magnificent tossed me out of the ring
landed on my shoulder clavicle snapped in half
doesnt it hurt
not when theyre going crazy for you
cassidy stands up and straddles him gazing soulfully at the scar
he was pierced for our transgressions he was crushed for our iniquities
the punishment that brought us peace was upon him and by his wounds we were healed
randy contemplates the quote
he likes it
its from passion of the christ
you never seen it
randy shrugs no
dude you gotta
she sits down next to him again
its like so inspiring
they throw everything at him
whips arrows rocks
just beat the living fuck out of him for the whole two hours
and he just takes it
ill have to check it out
cassidy lightly traces a finger along randys bicep scar
the sacrificial ram
the pitbull song ends
a new song begins
and now please welcome to the cheetahs stage
cassidy stands up
the lovely cassidy
randy reaches into a pocket and pulls out some bills
what do i owe
just gimme for three
randy peels off three s and hands them to her
youll wait til im done
randy just smiles
she gives him a small peck on the cheek and heads off
cassidy bursts onto the stage
she owns it with rock n roll energy
angle on randys face as he enjoys the dance
randy is driving over the throgs neck bridge
the van pulls up to a two family house in working class queens
out steps lex lethal from the passaic vfw show
randy heads down a highway entrance ramp lex lethal riding shotgun
thanks for the lift bro

randy merges into traffic on the long island expressway
so how bigs this place
two two fifty

difusco says hes gotten like calls last two days alone
randy chuckles cynically
god bless hardcore
a long island strip mall cent store
randy and lex browse an aisle
randy is holding a tin cake pan
he bangs it against his forehead testing it out
it makes a loud clang
lex takes the pan testing it against his own head
cookie trays were better
lex spots something exciting on another shelf
he grabs a pack of steel wool pads
randy nods in approval
lex tosses them into the shopping basket randy is holding
angle on basket
its full of all sorts of supplies cookie trays lightbulbs thumbtacks cheese graters wire hangers cutlery sets pizza cutters etc
lets see if they got extension cords
they head off in search
randy stands behind a curtain as his entrance song plays
he sneaks a peek through it
randys pov a rowdy crowd of about fills a community center gym
the vibe of the crowd is a bit rougher than previous events
a banner on the wall reads echw east coast hardcore wrestling
pressed against the outside of the ring are a folding table and a foot metal ladder
an announcer stands with a microphone
ladies and gentlemen
randy stands quiet and peaceful head lowered slightly
from elizabeth new jersey weighing in at pounds
the former wwf superstar and wrestling legend
the one the only
randy the ram robinnnnsonnnnn
randy explodes into the gym full of fire and showmanship
he does a lap around the outside of the ring
his hand is raised high in the air index finger and pinky curled into a set of rams horns
fans do the same
kids rush toward randy reaching out for high fives
he obliges as many as he possibly can
fans hold out folding chairs in front of him
just like in the opening montage
he rams each one with his forehead
if you want blood you got it
if you want blood you got it
he does a lap around the perimeter of the ring enthusiastically head butting chairs the whole way
blood on the streets blood on the rocks blood in the gutter every last drop if you want blood you got it
randy climbs into the ring
he does a few neck rolls and knee bends limbering up
the song fades down
a new song rises
ugly plodding hardcore death metal
and his opponent from hampton virginia weighing in at pounds
the boos begin to rain down
through the curtain hellbilly cannibal emerges
a huge overalls clad mangy wild eyed masochist
crumbs cling to his scraggly beard
hes dragging a heavy canvas sack
a teenager in the crowd holds up a sign reading hellbilly hellbilly cannibal climbs into the ring with his sack and a folding chair
he heads to the center of the ring where randy awaits
they sit down on chairs facing each other
under hellbilly cannibals chair is his canvas sack
under randys is his dollar tree plastic shopping bag
hellbilly cannibal punches randy
randy punches hellbilly cannibal
they take turns punching each other each shot a little harder than the last
its like a violent game of slaps
after a stretch of this hellbilly cannibal reaches into his sack and pulls out a can of bug spray
he sprays it in randys face
randy falls off his chair
he staggers around the ring clutching his face howling in agony
hellbilly cannibal smashes the blinded randy over the head with his chair
randy falls to his knees
hellbilly cannibal reaches into his sack and pulls out a fluorescent light tube
wielding it like a bat he smacks randy in the face
the tube explodes with a pop
grabbing a folding chair hellbilly cannibal charges toward randy
he takes a flying leap riding the chair like a boogie board
just as hes about to crash down on randy randy rolls out of the way
hellbilly cannibals spine gets a violent jolt as the chair hits the mat
randy reaches into his dollar tree bag and pulls out an aluminum cookie tray
he smacks hellbilly cannibal in the face with it
the tray makes an awesomely loud metallic clang
randy hits him a bunch more times
randy is starting to get winded
his heart beats faster
he picks up hellbilly cannibal and flings him toward the ropes
hellbilly cannibal bouncing off ducks randys awaiting forearm
he bounces off the opposite ropes and crashes into randy knee first
hellbilly cannibal grabs randy by the hair and smashes his face into the corner post
he scoops him up and flips him over the top rope out of the ring
randy lands hard on the concrete floor
hellbilly cannibal hops out of the ring with the folding chair
he whales randy in the face with it
randy stumbles backwards toward the metal barricade between the ring and the fans
hellbilly cannibal kicks him in the chest
randy flips over the barricade into the crowd
fans scatter in an exhilarated panic
hellbilly cannibal throws randy into a row of empty chairs
randy goes sprawling
chairs fly everywhere
randy gets up
his heart is beating loud
randy dazed heads toward the snack bar area
hellbilly cannibal follows after him
randy grabs a metal garbage can and whips around with it smacking hellbilly cannibal square in the face
hellbilly cannibal goes down
randy shakes out the cans contents over hellbilly cannibal showering him in trash
he shoves hellbilly cannibals head into the can and falls on it ass first
randy grabs the ladder resting along the base of the ring
he pounds the garbage can with it making an unholy racket
with the can still over his head hellbilly cannibal rises to his feet
he headbutts randy with the can
randy stumbling around gets headbutted again
hellbilly cannibal throws off the can and drags randy back to the ring by his hair carrying the ladder in his other hand
plopping randy down on the mat hellbilly cannibal sets up the ladder in the middle of the ring
he heads back out and grabs the folding table setting it up by the ladder
he reaches into randys dollar tree bag and pulls out a box of thumbtacks
he scatters the tacks all over the table
hellbilly cannibal grabs randy and pulls him up the ladder with him
they stand at the top perched high above the table
just as hellbilly cannibal is about to push off randy surprises him with a vicious head butt
hellbilly cannibal is caught totally off guard
randy headbutts him again
randy grabs hellbilly cannibal and pushes off
in mid air randy does a twist causing hellbilly cannibal to crash through the table with randy on top of him
hellbilly cannibal rolls around the mat in a daze his back bloodied and covered with tacks
he staggers to his feet
randy hits him with a dropkick
randys heartbeat is deafening
all other sounds drop out
randy pulls hellbilly cannibal off the mat
as he gears up for another dropkick his knees buckle
a look comes over his face
he drops to his knees one hand on the mat
randy grabs his arm
he massages it
he flops over clutching his chest
he lies on his back gasping for breath sucking at the air
randys pov the fans are unaware anything is wrong
they assume its part of the act
hellbilly cannibal sees a look of fear in randys eyes
he knows this is real
he looks out at the crowd
is there a doctor
few fans look around
most of them still think this is a gag
among those who sense its real is jerry difusco the events promoter
he climbs into the ring
kneels over randy
randy is gasping
difusco turns to hellbilly cannibal
lex lethal and some of the other wrestlers climb into the ring
they huddle around randy
lets get him up
with no small effort they lift randy
they carry him to the ropes
they slow unsure how best to get him through
put him down
they lower him to the mat
lex hops out of the ring and grabs randys ankles
several of the other guys hop out of the ring supporting randys underside as they carefully awkwardly pull him out
by now the crowd realizes this is real
they surge forward as difusco and the wrestlers carry randy toward the exit
get back get back get back
randy is carried down a long hallway trailed by curious and concerned fans
lex is closest to randys head
youre okay buddy
they reach a door and enter
the wrestler holding randys feet shuts it behind them
randy lies on a table his eyes rolling back in his head
lex squeezes his hand trying to keep him conscious
stay with us bro
ems workers come rushing in
randy lies unconscious
theres a breathing tube in his mouth and another tube going through his chest wall
hes hooked up to a mechanical ventilator
randy lies asleep
the breathing tube is out
the chest tube is still in
his eyes slowly open
he looks around disoriented
confused by all the wires on him he starts pulling things off
nurses rush into the room calming him down as they try to reattach the wires
randy transferred to a regular hospital room is watching all my children on the wall mounted tv
the chest tube is out in its place a large bandage
slight indian accent mr
randy looks up
tarachandani enters the room

the doctor nodding looks down randys folder
so how we lookin doc
a lot better than before the bypass

from the doctors face its not quite that simple
youre going to have to start taking much better care of it
for starters you must take your medication every day
i could handle that
randy nods and no cocaine
defensive offended i dont do coke
its all over your blood work
sheepish busted maybe once in a while
well it has to be never
randy gives him a reluctant nod
as for exercise its still okay as long as its moderate
so like wrestling

what if i do it moderate
i could hold back on certain moves
theres always ways to fake mr
edgy glare randy
randy a man with your heart should not be flying around a ring crashing into people
randys nostrils flare
with all due respect dr
reads name tag trachanani id like a second opinion on that
but i promise you any doctor i showed your file would say the same thing
randy lets out a skeptical sarcastic snort
you almost died
the next time you wont be so lucky
i want a second opinion
your hearts been through a lot
even before the heart attack it was significantly i want a second opinion
randy is checking out of the hospital
this is your copy
the admissions desk woman hands him some paperwork
he folds it up and stuffs it in a pocket
this was left for you
she hands him a plain white envelope
randy opens it
inside is a note randy looks into the envelope again and pulls out
he looks at the money chuckling ironically
its his biggest payday in years
he tucks it in a pocket
you have somebody picking you up
randy steps out of the hospital into the bright light of day
he squints his eyes adjusting
he stands there looking around a lost animal
a cab pulls up to randys van still parked in the community centers lot
randy steps out of the cab and limps to the van
he gets in
randy sits in the van in the otherwise empty lot pondering his next move
randy roams an aisle killing time idly browsing the selection of deodorants
randy looks up
he heads down the aisle toward the voice
he comes to the
a female pharmacist stands holding a small pharmacy bag
randy heads toward her
is that you
he gives her a small embarrassed nod taking the bag
randy hands len the manager a bunch of cash
len notices he seems a little off
len removes the padlock from randys trailer door
a messy junk filled trailer
randy stands at the kitchen counter with the cvs bag
he opens the bag and takes out four prescription pill bottles
we catch a glimpse of the drug names on them he gazes at the patient name on all of them
randy is taking a shower
on his chest is a surgery bandage
he soaps up careful not to get the bandage wet
randy collapses on the bed exhausted
randy lies on the bed gazing off
something catches his eye
randys pov on the floor in front of the tv is an old nintendo videogame system
the game cartridge in the console is wrestlejam
randy sticks his head out of his trailer
randys pov in front of the opposite trailer adam one of the kids he was play wrestling with is idly throwing a tennis ball against a car
adam turns and looks toward randy
wanna play nintendo
randy and adam sit on the floor playing wrestlejam
cyber randy is wrestling the ayatollah at a packed madison square garden
the graphics are late s crude
randy flies all over the ring devastating his foe with a series of acrobatic leaps and kicks and flips
randy wears a look of intense concentration
adam makes a scrunched up face at the screen
whats that square
that youre hitting me with
its a folding chair
thats a chair
yes its a chair
randy grunts annoyed
they play for a stretch in silence
this is old
that was like years before i was born
shut up and fight
outside trailer ad aam
adam looks toward the window
randy hits pause
adam turns back to the tv
adam nods yeah
randy un pauses
cyber randy drops the ayatollah with a knee to the chest
the ayatollah goes down
randy heads to a corner and he raises his arms sticking his elbows out pressing his fists to the sides of his head to form a set of rams horns
he flies high in the air soaring over the mat and crashing down on the ayatollah horns first
he pins the ayatollah as the ref counts to three for the victory
the crowd goes wild
randy does a little celebratory fist pump
he hits reset
i gotta go
dont you wanna get even
i whipped your butt
adam gets up and scampers out of the trailer
randy suddenly alone looks at the tv
he gazes at the words on the screen he selects player
a new match begins
randy plays without much enthusiasm
after a few halfhearted kicks and punches he tosses the randy standing in the middle of the trailer does a jumping jack
he does another
a few more
he feels himself getting winded
a little woozy
he sits down
he sits still trying to slow his heart
he starts to cry
angry bitter frightened tears roll down his cheeks
randy enters the club
its crowded tonight
he looks around for cassidy
he spots her in a corner offering a customer a lapdance
the customer passes
she moves on
randy heads over
she gives him a friendly little cheek peck
youre back soon
ah i was just in the neighborhood
cassidy nods oh
hey feel like maybe grabbing a burger
cassidy finds the offer a little odd
this isnt how they operate
how bout later then
she looks at him puzzled
he seems off
can we talk for a sec
someplace more quiet
randy glances toward the door
cassidy catching his drift looks at him a little gravely
randy i cant leave with a customer
i had a heart attack
i needed to talk to somebody
you cant talk here
just a couple minutes
randy i dont do that
cassidy looks at him torn
she sees the need the fear in his eyes
where are you parked
another pause of hesitation from cassidy
this is big
go to your car
ill meet you out there in minutes
randy sits in the van staring at the clubs rear emergency exit
cassidy emerges a jacket covering her dress
spotting him she comes over climbing in the passenger side
i appreciate it
she looks at his vulnerable expression
thats fucked up dude
when was it
feelin much better
it was while i was wrestling
i collapsed in the ring
yeah it was pretty fucked up
he chuckles a little perversely
tell ya though it was a big hit with the fans
amused grin promoter told me everybody was hanging around wondering if i was okay they wound up buying up all of his t shirts and shit
whole merch table got cleaned out
randys grin fades
his expression turns melancholy fearful
doctor says i cant wrestle no more
what are you gonna do
i dont know
i dont know what to do
if i cant wrestle
he loses himself in some bleak thought
it just happened
you dont have to figure everything out this second
give yourself some time
times all i got
i just sit there all day
he stares off bleakly again
you really shouldnt be alone right now
he turns to her looking her in the eye
thats why i came to see you
a little unnerved randy
she looks at him with sympathy
i feel bad what happened
but you and me
i cant go there
randy gives her a sour disappointed look
you should be with family now
you have a daughter right
where is she
we dont really get along too good
it doesnt matter
you need her
bitter chuckle she dont need me
everybody needs a father
randy shrugs not so sure
cassidy glances at the dashboard clock
i gotta get back in
she puts a sympathetic hand on his knee
you take care of yourself
she gives him a peck on the cheek
he lingers there for a second
a weird tentative moment
you gonna be okay
he nods putting his brave face back on
im randy the ram
ive taken bigger bumps than this
maybe ill give my daughter a call
why the fuck not
im her father
a person only gets one father in this life
unless youre adopted
she gives him a friendly pat on the shoulder
youre gonna be just fine
cassidy climbs out of the van
randy watches as she heads back into the club
his cheery expression fades
he is alone again
randy sits on his bed sifting through a messy junk filled shoebox
he pulls out an old photo
randys pov its a mid s photo of randy and his infant daughter stephanie in front of the family christmas tree
randy wearing a santa cap is smiling and laughing stephanie perched on his huge steroid pumped bicep
he flips the photo over
on the back are a bunch of scribbled phone numbers
theyre all crossed out except the last one
the numbers get progressively more faded from bottom to top as if theyve been written down over the course of years
randy stands at a pay phone with the photo ringing phone cradled to his ear
this is stephanie you know what to do
answering machine beep randy listens to the silence
he hangs up
randy sits in his van by the curb of a modest lower middle class house
he looks at the house working up the nerve to approach
randy stands at the doorstep of the house
steeling himself he rings the bell
a woman appears at the door in a t shirt and panties
a little thrown hey
is stephanie home
the woman looks at randy a little coldly sensing who he is
who can i say it is
she disappears into the house
a few moments later stephanie emerges with a backpack slung over her shoulder
in her hands is a textbook
she heads straight down the driveway blowing past randy
where you going
he goes after her
he catches up
what do you want
can we talk
nows really not a good time
she resumes walking briskly
chasing after her where ya going
he looks at the textbook in her hands principles of child you in school
she turns down the sidewalk
he continues following
middlesex county community
thats kind of a hike
wheres your car
no response you taking the bus
lemme give you a lift
its no problem
im parked right by
stephanie picks up the pace trying to lose him
youre walking pretty fast there
you running late
no answer i could help you with that
no answer give you a ride
she keeps right on walking
new jersey transit sucks
the buses smell like piss
she fights off an amused smile
she slows a tiny bit
randy is driving stephanie
left at the second stop sign
he slows at the second stop sign which is at a bigger four lane street
he makes the left
they drive for a stretch in awkward silence
randy seems a little nervous
you gonna talk
a pause as randy gathers his words
theres something i wanted to tell you
i had a heart attack
he looks at her earnestly
i wanna try to fix things
stephanie sits there in calm silence processing all of this
you are such an asshole
taken aback why
now you wanna fix things
now that suddenly youre all scared and alone from your heart attack
its not like this is so fuckin you
you only come around when you need something from somebody when they can do something for you
she suddenly opens her door as the van is moving
she hops out
randy hits the brakes alarmed
what are you doing
stephanie stumbles and falls
she gets up
walks off in the direction they came from
he angrily punches the steering wheel
randy lies on his bed gazing off depressedly
on his chest is a well worn day planner open to a marked up page
angle on page
scribbled in marker in one of the boxes is
randy standing at a folding table in a gym unzips a duffel bag
he pulls out a stack of x glossies of himself
its a high flying mid air ram jam photo from the height of his s glory
he puts them on the table
looks around the gym
randys pov hes at an autograph show that hasnt started yet
around the perimeter of the gym ten folding tables are set up
at each one a beat up worn out old wrestler is laying out his wares x s old match tapes etc
didnt think id see you here
randy looks up and sees scott brumberg the promoter from the beginning
hes wearing the same brumberg mets jersey
heard you collapsed at the difusco show
sounded pretty scary
randy smiles coyly
sold the shit outta that one
i gotta give credit
difusco came up with the idea
were setting up an angle for a grudge match
dude you are good
randy gives a proud hey what can i say
i was sure id have to cancel the minivan
the one i rented for fanfest
randy looks at him surprised
me and a whole gangs driving down
i am so fuckin psyched
you see the flyer
randy looks at him blankly
brumberg walks over to a nearby table where theres a stack of bright orange flyers
the same flyer can be seen scattered around the room on chairs the floor etc
he grabs one and brings it back over
volpe gave me an assload to pass out
he hands it to brumberg
that is gonna be epic
randys pov the flyer
randy nods vaguely at the flyer his feelings hard to read
brumberg looks around the room as the wrestlers set up shop
should get a pretty good crowd today
randy holds up his hand wiggling his fingers for brumberg
ill start loosening up
brumberg walks off
randy looks at the flyer again
a sour expression comes over his face
the signing is underway
five or so fans mill about the room drifting from table to table getting autographs and taking photos with the motley assortment of washed up aging wrestlers
randy is sitting behind his table signing one of his x s for a fan
he hands it to the guy who hands randy a bill
you got it broski
the fan walks off
randy tucks the fiver into the fanny pack hes wearing
theres not much in there just a meager few ones and fives
randy zips up the fanny pack
he looks up ready to sign more autographs just as soon as somebody comes over
randy sits at his table bored
there are no takers
he looks around the room at the other wrestlers
randys pov one is asleep
another looks borderline homeless
across from him is a something wrestler in a wheelchair
attached to his calf is a urine bag
a feeble stream of urine trickles into the bag
randy looks down at the stack of randy the ram x s on the table
he gazes numbly at the high flying image of himself from years earlier
randy looks up and sees brumberg
i was sure the turnoutd be bigger
randy shrugs resignedly
randy pulls up to his trailer
he sits there with the engine idling staring at his trailer scared to go in alone
he pulls back out again
cassidy roaming the room approaches a customer sitting near the stafe
she leans in to his ear her hand on his arm
would you like a lapdance sweetie
cassidy moves along
she approaches a pair of guys
she leans in to one of them
would you like a lapdance
not right now
she looks toward the other guy
before she can even ask im good
cassidy heads off rejected
she turns and sees randy
shes happy to see him after the string of nos
how ya feeling
she leads him over to a table
howd it go with your daughter
randy dodges her eye contact
not too good actually
she tore me a new asshole
he nods dispiritedly
you cant give up
you gotta keep trying
another half hearted nod
a brief conversational lull
i was thinking about maybe getting her a present
thats a great idea
whats she into
im not sure
how old is she
what kind of music does she like
i dont know
is she into books
randy just looks at her blankly
how could you not know
shes your daughter
im a shitty fuckin father
cassidy feeling bad is hit with an urge to help
you should get her some clothes some kinda clothes
all girls like that
that could work
i know the perfect place
this kick ass little vintage shop in westfield
saturdays the best time to go
thats when they get the new stuff in all these boxes full of great shit
ill write it down
cassidy grabs a pen and a cocktail napkin off the bar
im pretty sure its on
she scribbles down yesterdaze westfield
hands it to him
you got it
cassidy starts dancing for him as is their routine
randy doesnt seem into it
im gonna grab a drink at the bar
randy gets up and heads off toward the bar
she watches him go feeling rejected
cassidy gets up
camera stays on her face as she does a lap around the club
she glances back toward the bar
cassidys pov randy is sitting at bar
she scans the room
a customer is looking her way
she starts to approach
then she stops
she looks back toward randy again
hes sitting at the bar alone
she heads over to him
he looks up from his drink
that was fast
cassidy pauses hesitant
she takes the plunge how bout i meet you there saturday
help you out
im actually gonna be running around right in that area anyway so its not really a pain
you got it
she gives him a chummy arm tap and walks off
randy knocks on waynes door
wayne looks up at randy mildly annoyed by the disruption
on his computer screen is an online poker game
got a sec
i was wondering if you had something more steady
only thing i got right nows got weekends
isnt that when you sit on other dudes faces
what is it
randy seems a little hesitant
so like working with customers
all day long hot horny housewives begging for your meat
and prepared salads
randy thinks it over
thats the only thing you got
at the moment
randy stands alone in front of yesterdaze a strip mall vintage clothing store
he looks at his watch almost thinking of leaving
randy looks up
he seems slightly thrown by what he sees
randys pov its his first time seeing cassidy in street clothes and in daylight
shes not wearing makeup and her hair is pulled back in a ponytail
shes also a good three inches shorter out of her stripper heels
they shake hands a bit awkwardly
i almost didnt recognize you
you look all
nah nah i dont mean that bad
i like it
its like in grease where she turns into the hot rock n roll chick at the end
randy looks at her sneakers a far cry from the clear heels hes used to
should i call you cassidy or pam
she gives the question genuine thought
playful finger wag but dont get used to it
randy follows cassidy toward the back of the store
he looks around taking in the array of funky s s s clothes
this is awesome
rubs hands together we are gonna find something great
cassidy is less loose and playful than randy much more in business mode
they come to the back where against the wall she finds what shes looking for a bunch of cardboard boxes bursting with a wildly eclectic assortment of tops skirts pants
she starts sifting through
do you know her size
shes kinda skinny a little shorter than you
cassidy spots a fun multi color mini skirt
she pulls it out
could you see her in this
im not sure
cassidy tosses it back in
she unearths a flashdance style what about this
randy makes a sour face
she tosses it back
so like what is she
randy ponders the choices
cassidy lets out a good natured groan of frustration
randy watches as she continues searching
thank you very much
cassidy looks at him
she can feel his sincere appreciation
she returns to searching
sift sift sift sift
i think she might be a lesbian
cassidy stops sifting
she looks up at him
does that help
cassidy leads randy by the arm over to the
cassidy heads to a rack of clothes
she quickly zeroes in on a retro bowling shirt
she holds it up to randy who makes a scrunched up face
ah maybe shes just a friend
cassidy puts the bowling shirt back
as she does something catches randys eye
cassidy holds up the item for randy
an excited look comes over randys face
randys pov a satin green roller disco jacket
embroidered on the left breast is a big s in purple script
cassidy looks at the jacket
she clearly finds it awful
she looks at randy whos beaming with excitement and pride
she finds it very endearing
yesterdaze bag in hand randy opens the door to his van
he and tosses the bag inside
hes on a post shop high mission accomplished
you found it
i never woulda known about this place
okay ill give you that
a tentative pause
cassidy looks at him ready to part ways
man i worked up a pretty good thirst in there
what say we grab a beer
i gotta get going
we gotta re hydrate
cassidy seems torn
i really cant
i got a kid at home
you have a kid
i had no idea
cassidy shrugs casually
boy or girl
i had no friggin idea
its not something i usually tell customers
not exactly a turn on
randy looks off at something by his van
an idea hits him
he unlocks the door
leaning into the van he tears the randy the ram action figure off the dashboard
he proudly excitedly holds it out to cassidy
now both our kids got something
she looks at the action figure reluctant to take it
youre gonna turn this down too
man youre rough
cassidy chuckles a little
she takes it
thats very nice of you
tell him to take good care of that
bucks on ebay
cassidy laughs a little
she cant help but be charmed by his sweetness and earnestness
after a pause
randy and cassidy are having beers at the bar
hes holding her cellphone looking at pictures of her son
he moves on to the next one
hes a good lookin kid
i think so
i see where he gets it from
cassidy smiles flattered
he sure doesnt get it from his douchebag father
randy skips to the next pic
its a shot of an under whats that
just this condo thing down by trenton
you moving there
working on it
its a great area
and the schools are awesome
what about cheetahs
a little disappointed oh
nods to self okay
randys ears perk up at the song on the jukebox
he stands up reaching out for cassidys hand
she doesnt give it
this isnt a dance place
fuckin def lep
ive danced to this plenty
then im dancing for you
randy starts dancing in front of cassidy whos sitting on a barstool
is this a lapdance im getting
randy goes into lapdance mode seductively writhing for her silly and self aware
just sit back and enjoy
he turns around wiggling his ass a little for her
he runs his hands up and down her sides
he drapes his long blond mane over her shoulders running it over her face
she laughs charmed and amused
he gazes into her eyes intensely
the lapdancer has become the lapdanced
he continues dancing totally unembarrassed
i think we can get you a shift
randy bobs his head along to the kick ass def leppard tune really loving it
the song builds to its chorus
randy sings along
take a bottle shake it up break the bubble break it u up
pour some sugar on me
in the name of love
cassidy unable to resist the call of the lep joins in
pour some sugar on me
cmon fire me up
pointing at each other pour your sugar on me
i cant get enough
eye contact sultry im hot sticky sweet from my head to my feet yeah
from here the song veers off into a guitar part
randy nods along savoring the awesome hair metal riffing
they dont make em like they used to
fuckin eighties man
best shit ever
def lep gunners
then that cobain pussy had to come around and ruin it all
like theres something wrong with having a good time
fuckin mopey douchebag
ooh look at me
i wear flannel
im all depressed
im from seattle
i like rain
randy shakes his head sourly
nineties fuckin sucked
their eyes meet
a moment of chemistry
randy moves closer his eyes locked on hers
he leans in for
they make out for a few seconds
cassidy pulls back
she gives randy a playfully scolding finger wag masking her fear and discomfort with what just happened
no contact with the customers
he keeps right on dancing totally unaware of the shift that just occurred in her
glancing at watch i totally didnt realize the time
we just got here
i should get home
she stands up
randy is very disappointed
you said one beer
randy points toward her almost full beer on the bar
she picks it up and chugs the whole thing
she slaps the empty bottle on the bar
she gives him an arm pat and walks out of the bar
randy is impressed
its randys first day of work
he slips into a deli coat
tucks his hair into a hairnet
pulls a shop rite baseball cap over the hairnet
he walks over to a mirror to see how he looks in his new uniform
he feels a little silly
here ya go
he turns and sees wayne who hands him something
randy looks at the item in his hand vaguely bothered
i thought it was gonna say randy
angle on item a shop rite name tag
the name on it is robin
guess they got it off your w
do i really even need to wear one
are you gonna be interacting with our valued shop rite customers
yeah but i then yes
could they maybe re do it
just wear the fucking thing
wayne walks off
randy pins the name tag to his apron
he takes another look in the mirror sighing unhappily
randy looks up at the employee room clock
he heads toward a rubber strip curtain leading to the deli counter
standing before the curtain he pauses a moment gathering himself like before a wrestling match
he steps through
about customers hover in front of the deli counter with take a number tickets
randy manning the counter hands an old guy in a wwii veteran baseball cap a packet of roast beef
the guy shuffles off
randy looks up at the take a number sign
a woman s steps forward holding a and a shop rite circular
she carefully surveys the turkey breast selection in the case
the hudson acres are they all on sale or just the regular
randy looks clueless
holding up circular its a little unclear
she hands the circular to randy to take a look
randys pov it says hudson acres turkey breast
he still has no idea
id prefer the maple glazed but if its full price
randy briefly catches eyes with another customer a big haired semi hot party chick in her forties
the kind of woman randy would hit on in a bar
he dodges her eye contact embarrassed by the context
to circular lady hang on let me
randy picks up a phone behind the counter
into phone over wayne please come to the deli counter
he cringes a bit as his voice booms over the store speakers
he hangs up and returns to the customer
itll just be a minute
the woman nodding looks into the deli case again
which in your opinion is the best smoked ham
i guess it depends what you like
i tried the apple valley farms once and it was very salty
do you find that
randy steals a self conscious glance at the party chick
angle on take a number sign
it says now serving
a woman in workout clothes steps forward with a
could i get a half pound of the pesto pasta salad
randy grabs a plastic container
pesto change o
the woman smiles at randys little offhand pasta pun
this pleases him
randy scoops pesto pasta salad into the container
he puts the container onto the scale
i am good
this gets randy a small chuckle from the woman
randy slaps a price tag on the container
can i get you anything else
he hands her the container
you have yourself a nice day
friendly smile i will
the woman heads off
randys spirits are lifted by the exchange
randy looks up at the take a number sign now serving
a housewife type steps forward with the number
the housewife smiles
whats my prize
anything in the case sweetheart
a pound of chopped liver and a half a pound of egg salad
i think that can be arranged
he grabs a plastic container and throws it in the air catching it behind his back
stephanie emerges from the middlesex county community college building
a look of surprise comes over her face
stephanies pov randy is standing there waiting for her by his van
under his arm is a lumpily wrapped present no box
what are you stalking me
do stalkers bring presents
well i aint a stalker
he excitedly hands her the present
she looks at it warily
she opens it
inside is the green satin jacket
she holds it up trying to process
the s is for stephanie
she looks at the jacket
its nothing she would ever wear
i got it just for you
i see that
whats it for

she looks at randy
he is excited and proud
i was looking in this store and saw it and i just said that is it
stephanie nods smiling politely
so what are you doing now

we have an old favorite spot
youll remember when you see

cmon give an old man a break
he giver her his biggest most charming puppy dog smile
randy and stephanie walk along the boardwalk
its a charming little jersey shore boardwalk beach lined with skee ball games ice cream parlors t shirt shops etc
its a bit cold and not very crowded still out of season
you really dont remember
guess you were pretty young
they walk for a stretch in silence
he points to a spot
there used to be this funhouse
the monster motel
randy chuckles at the memory
they had this cheesy ass skeleton that popped out of a coffin
youd get so scared youd cry
then youd beg to go in again
chuckles to self always was a glutton for punishment
youd hop on my foot and wrap your arms around my leg
id have to walk you the whole way through like that
i totally dont remember
looks at her sweetly i do
randy and stephanie sit on a bench facing the ocean eating mint chocolate chip ice cream cones
randy is quiet and contemplative not in his usual on mode
he takes a deep breath
i accept your apology
she shoots him an irked look
not like that
i just mean
you made amends
i free you
her expression softens
anything youve ever done or said or thought i forgive
youve done nothing wrong to me
and anything ive ever done
stephanie is surprised by his emotion and sincerity
i was young
my career was booming
all those lights the fans the crazy shit on the road
i wasnt thinking about my kid
or my wife
my priorities were all fucked up
i know that
i wanna try to make things right
i wanna try to get to know you
lump in throat i just hope its not too late
randy gazes off at the ocean filled with fear and love and regret
a tear starts to gather in his eye
he wipes it away before it has a chance to form
stephanie looks at him moved
randy and stephanie play skee ball side by side father and daughter
randy stands with stephanie in front of her house dropping her off
hope that wasnt too painful
it was okay
randy unsure what to do extends his hand
he pulls her in for a brief mechanical hug
how about dinner sometime
stephanie thinks it over
i dont think so
nodding casual or not
thats cool whatever
wednesday would work better
randy is surprised and happy
randy sticks the old christmas photo of stephanie and himself on the fridge
randy stands at the pay phone ringing phone to his ear
in his hands is his day planner open to a page marked up with upcoming gigs

momentous pause im retiring
hey how ya doin frank
randy is holding the fanfest flyer
you know id kill to do it
its time to move on
cassidy is up on stage doing her thing for a sizable crowd
she slinks up to a customer whos holding out a dollar bill for her
she pulls on her g string band snapping it shut on the bill
she moves over to another customer holding out a dollar and does the same
she looks toward the voice coming from another side of the stage
cassidys pov standing there is randy holding out a purple envelope
he looks toward her g string like he wants to put it in like a dollar bill
she takes it with her hand instead
randy and cassidy sit together at a table
cassidy is holding the purple envelope looking a little uncomfortable
ill do it later when its quiet
i wanna watch
reluctantly cassidy opens it
inside is a greeting card
cassidys pov on the cards front a cartoon monkey is holding a big bunch of bananas
across the top it says randy watches excitedly as she reads the inside
she puts the it down after reading it
thats very sweet
i couldntve done it without you
im glad i could help

she nods politely reservedly clearly trying to pull back
another guarded nod
hey you ever been to mother kellys

randy is confused and disappointed

i dont think you wanna get with that
what if i do

a long wounded pause from randy
i got it
he takes a out of his pocket holding it out to her
whats that for
he slides it across the bar to her
she slides it back
youre refusing a customer
he slides the back to her
gimme a lapdance
she slides it back again

he waves the tauntingly in her face
she pushes it away
whats the matter

he tauntingly dangles the in front of her again
it doesnt mean anything
she looks away trying to ignore him

he starts slicing
wow thats freaky

angle on the block of cheese as randy slices
theres only a small chunk left
the chunk dwindles getting smaller and smaller
the cheese separating randys fingers from the blade grows thin
he almost seems tempted
randy unable to sleep sits shirtless on the couch staring blankly at the tv
an nba highlight clip of a ferocious dunk
the crowd goes wild
the player roars as he runs back up court full of macho swagger
randys eyes drift downward toward his chest
he gazes at the still fresh scar
touches it tenderly
he takes a big swig of wine polishing off a bottle
he pops a cassette into the boombox on the floor
guns n roses randy cranks up the volume and hits play
the song begins with the sound of a roaring stadium crowd
a chant begins guns
randy starts to prowl the floor like its a wrestling ring before a match
he waves his arms exhorting the crowd on the song as if their cheers are for him
cups hand to ear whats that
randy works the crowd
he points at a fan in the back row
bangs his head on pretend chairs
randy grabs the top rope and gives it a hard shake
loosening up with some neck rolls and trunk twists he heads to the center of the ring
folks we are ready to rumble
the song which starts with a slow bluesy guitar intro kicks in
fast raging hard rock
randy stares down his invisible opponent
the opponent sucker punches him
randy drops to the ground
randy lies on the floor getting kicked and punched
he knocks his opponent down with a leg sweep and pops up
randy hits his opponent with a flurry of backhand chops
ive never seen such determination
randy immobilizes his opponent in some sort of headlock
randy flips his opponent upside down his head between his knees
he drops him headfirst onto the bed mat
just listen to this place
randy scoops up his opponent again and slams him to the mat with another fancy move
the song reaches its frenzied chant like chorus get in the ring

randys temptation grows with each shot
he cant resist any longer
randy pushes booker d out of the way

booker d spots something intriguing by the bar entrance
randy and mcpride follow his gaze there
randys pov two women late s frosted hair tight denim miniskirts just walked in the bar
he catches the twosome stealing a glance in their direction
ring rats oclock
randy and mcpride seem to agree with his assessment
the wrestlers are dancing with the women melissa and alyssa on the bars dance floor
melissa is sandwiched between booker d and mcpride shaking her ass for them like a year old spring breaker
alyssa is paired off with randy grinding her ass against him
she turns facing him
looks at him with a coy smile
i know who you are
she slowly runs her hands up randys sides
my brother used to have your poster on his door
randy smiles pleased
dudes got taste
alyssa notices something intriguing over randys shoulder
randy turns to see what shes looking at
randys pov standing by the bar is a man

randy and alyssa are doing bumps of
randy is fucking alyssa from behind over the bathroom sink
alyssa moans loudly
theres a knock at the door

randys pov his eyes slowly open
staring down at him from a white stucco ceiling is a poster of a hunky shirtless fireman with a pair of suspenders stretched across his oiled up six pack
across the bottom it says five alarm fire
randy looks around disoriented
he is naked in a strange bed in a strange bedroom
his clothes lie on the floor next to a randy wearing only a pair of bikini briefs staggers into the kitchen
a roommate in a tweety bird nightshirt is pouring herself a bowl of honey nut cheerios
she looks at randy with a casual wassup head nod
alyssas in the shower
randy emerges from alyssas building in the previous nights clothes squinting at the blinding sunlight
randy enters his trailer chuckling amusedly
he tosses his keys on the table
he heads over to the fridge and grabs a beer
as he closes the fridge his expression changes
a look of deep dismay comes over his face
randys pov the old photo of him and stephanie on the fridge door
randy rings the bell
stephanies friend answers the door
she stares at him coldly and unnervingly
is stephanie home
she goes into the house closing the door behind her
randy stands there awkwardly unsure what that meant
he thinks about knocking but doesnt
he carefully turns the knob leaning into the house
from somewhere inside he hears the muffled sound of stephanie and the friend talking
stephanie and the friend are arguing in the living room
you dont have to go out there
you dont owe him shit
i know that
then why would you even looks up toward front who said you could come in
the friends stephanies pov standing there is randy gazing guiltily at stephanie
please leave my house

the friend disgusted grabs her coat and storms off out the front door
randy and stephanie are alone
she glares at him for what feels like a long time
youre such a fucking asshole
i feel horrible
i waited in that restaurant two hours

i know i fucked up

a walking living breathing fuck up
im trying to change
i cant stand when i just please shut the fuck up
because i cant even stand the sound of your voice
i thought about having a drink for the first time in months last night
thats what you do to me
she grabs a small potted plant off the table and throws it at him
it narrowly misses his head exploding against the wall
fucking piece of shit asshole
she grabs a can of soda off the same table and throws it
it nails him in the thigh exploding open on the floor
soda sprays everywhere
she looks around half crazed searching for something else to throw
he rushes toward her wrapping her up in his arms
get off me
he squeezes tighter
she thrashes around fighting it
thrashing violently you dont mean that
suddenly she stops resisting
a strange and unexpected calm washes over her
i dont mean it
she is silent and still
she shakes her head placidly gazing off
i dont know why i got so hysterical
theres no reason
i dont hate you
i dont love you
i dont like you
i was stupid to think you could change
i can change
i dont care
i know i can
i dont care

she turns and looks him in the eye
i dont want to ever see you again
i dont wanna see you i dont want to hear you
actually i dont care if you understand
she walks toward the front door
opens it wide
randy steps out the front door
stephanies cellphone rings
she looks at the caller id and picks up
you can come home
she closes the door on him disappearing inside the house
randy stands there alone on his daughters front step
unsure what to do
he starts to cry

wayne gives him two quick claps and walks off
randy adjusts the machines setting and begins to slice
he isnt moving much faster
while were young
any year now
randy keeps right on slicing at his unhurried pace
he gets in a nice meditative groove
slice slice slice slice slice
he watches as his thumb inches closer to the spinning blade
he stares at his thumb
at the blade
he jams his thumb into the blade
blood squirts everywhere
on his coat
on the deli meat
randy stares at the deep gash watching as blood pulses out in crimson surges
he smiles strangely at it
a customer gasps
a commotion quickly spreads
randy turns and sees a shocked wayne rushing toward him
wayne takes randys arm and tries to lead him into the back out of view
conscious of customers lets get that patched up
randy roughly shoves him away
wayne stumbles backwards
randy turning toward the onlookers raises his thumb to his face
he dramatically smears the blood across his mouth
a woman shrieks
randy drags the gash across his cheek
he smears a line of it under each eye like warpaint
striking wrestling pose lets get it onnn
somebody call the cops
randy roars at wayne
wayne jumps back frightened
randy rumbles out of the deli area laughing
randy dashes down an aisle
he dodges a woman pushing a shopping cart purposely over dodging her so he crashes into the shelves and sends stuff flying
he dodges another shopper dramatically crashing into the shelves again
randy charges past the cashiers out of the supermarket
randy sits in the van in the shop rite parking lot
he gazes at himself in the rear view mirror dried blood caked on his face

he pulls out his wrestling tights
randy wearing rubber gloves and a towel around his neck combs peroxide through his hair
randy is shaving his chest
the hair has grown in since he last wrestled
randy stands in the middle of the trailer in just a pair of bikini briefs
in his hands is a product called tan in a can
he gives the can a good shake and starts spraying his body
randy puts a snacks and soda filled plastic bag in the front of the van
he is surprised to see cassidy pull up in her car
she gets out

walks outside toward his van

he grabs the fanfest flyer off the passenger seat and hands it to her

she watches him go the van kicking up dust in its wake
she looks at flier
a look of concern comes over her face
randy is driving south on the new jersey turnpike
cassidy grabs her purse and car keys off the kitchen table

the babysitter nods at the instructions
cassidy heads toward the
she is struck by what she sees
cassidys pov daniel is on the floor playing with the randy the ram doll
she watches as he makes the randy doll climb up the couchs armrest
the doll takes a flying leap off the couch onto a star wars figure laid out on the floor below
daniel makes an explosion sound as randy slams down on his foe
cassidy looks at the doll worried
cassidy is dancing onstage
she has a distracted faraway look in her eye
she abruptly walks off mid song
she heads toward the dressing room disappearing through the curtain
cassidy where ya goin baby
cassidy unlocks her locker
she throws everything in it into a duffel bag
she grabs the master lock off the locker door and throws it into the bag too
cassidy wearing her coat steps through the curtain with the bag
she cuts across the empty stage toward the exit
cassidy steps out of the club

the ayatollah chuckles
randy walks off highly annoyed

cassidy pulls into a gas station
she rolls down the window
a gas station attendant looks her way
do you know where the civic auditorium is
the card is underway
through a wall we hear the muffled sounds of a match in progress cheers boos crashes etc
randy sitting alone on a bench in just his jock strap tapes up his legs
his focus and intensity builds
cassidy pulls into the lot
theres a lot more cars than when randy pulled in
the buildings outer concourse
a handful of fans mill about at a concessions stand and a souvenir table
cassidy handing a ticket to an usher enters the building
she looks around the concourse not quite sure where to go
randy suited up in his tights paces the floor gearing himself up for the match
the only other wrestler in the locker room at the moment is the ayatollah doing neck rolls nearby
randy catches his eyes
ready to do this
through the wall arabic music starts to play
the ayatollah grabs a large iranian flag leaning against the lockers
he heads toward an entrance curtain randy close behind
through curtain from the islamic republic of iran weighing in at pounds
the tehran terror the beast of the middle east
the ayaaa tooo laaaaaah
the ayatollah steps through the curtain iranian flag raised high
he is promptly greeted with lusty boos
cassidy is walking around the concourse with a mounting sense urgency
she spots a security guy in a yellow windbreaker sitting by an unmarked door
she heads toward him
randy is peering through the narrow gap in the curtain watching the ayatollah make his entrance
faint amidst the boos death to america
randy turning is surprised to see cassidy standing there
she looks tired and worried and scared
what are you doing here

randy looks away unable to hold her gaze
through the curtain we hear the arabic music die down
from auditorium and his opponent
a new familiar song rises on the auditorium speakers
the crowd roars
points to curtain listen to them
this is where im great

randy looks at the curtain
he looks at cassidy
from elizabeth new jersey weighing in at pounds

he turns away from her toward the curtain
a true wrestling immortal one of the greatest of all time
randy the ram robinnnnsonnnnn
he steps through
randy bursts through the curtain to huge cheers
theres probably people there in the seat facility
seated at a ringside table are the matchs commentators a pair of wannabe marv alberts in their s
a sign taped to the table reads carolina wrestling network
next to the table is a videocamera on a tripod
there he is folks
randy the ram
randy raises a set of rams horns high in the air
fans do the same in tribute
history about to be made here at the greenville civic auditorium
randy takes a long lap around the ring ramming chair after chair
his head gets a little bloody
the fans eat it up
randy climbs into the ring where the ayatollah awaits
the cheers continue
loving appreciative sustained cheers
randy stands there soaking it in basking in their love
he grabs the microphone from the ring announcer
he looks around
a hush comes over the crowd
i just got one thing to say to you people
randy looks toward cassidy standing over by the entrance curtain
he looks out at the larger crowd
randy takes a contemplative pause
you take your lumps and bruises in this game
but you know what
its all worth it
because of you guys
your cheers keep me young
they make me feel alive
in the year i wrestled my first professional match i was six foot one
by i was five foot eleven
three back surgeries in years knocked two full inches off my height
i may be down to five eleven but performing in front of you people has always made me feel feet tall
and thats the way its always gonna be
randy looks toward cassidy whos standing over by the entrance curtain
their eyes meet
randy lowers the mike finished
the fans cheer wildly the loudest cheers yet
as randy nods appreciatively at the crowd the ayatollah sneaks up behind him with a folding chair
fans shout trying to warn randy about the sneak attack but he doesnt hear them
the ayatollah smashes him over the head
randy goes down
the match is on
the ayatollah picks up randy and throws him into the ropes
randy bounces back toward the ayatollah who lazily puts up an elbow for randy to run into
randy practically has to lead his face to the elbow
hitting the mat randy pops back up and grabs the ayatollah
the ayatollah phoning it in throws randy into the ropes again
this time the ayatollah has a raised knee waiting for randy
randy runs into it doing his best to sell the shot
under breath youre workin pretty light here
randy gets up and grabs the ayatollahs arms
with a nifty move he flips the ayatollah over his shoulder slamming him hard into the mat
randy falls on top of him pressing the ayatollahs face into the canvas
randy flips the ayatollah over onto his back pinning his shoulder blades
the ref swoops in
the ayatollah kicks out
they both get up
the ayatollah jogs toward the ropes
he bounces off
randy braces for something good but all he gets is a feeble chest slap
randy grabs the ayatollah and puts him in a headlock
anytime you wanna join in
randy scoops up the ayatollah and drops him over his knee with a backbreaker
the ayatollah grimaces in pain as he hits the mat
before he has a chance to get up randy hits him with a flying elbow drop
the ayatollah gets up pissed at the rough treatment
randy goes for a dropkick but the ayatollah catches his ankles in midair
he jerks upward on randys legs sending randy crashing to the mat on the back of his head
the ayatollah falls on randys throat with his knee
he grinds randys face into the canvas as randy did to him
cassidy is cringing
its hard for her to watch this
the ayatollah picks up randy and throws him into the ropes
randy bounces back flinging himself sideways at the ayatollah
the ayatollah catches him in mid air cradling him in his arms
the ayatollah drops randy onto his bent knee
randy falls to the canvas clutching his side
the ayatollah falls on top of him
forgot how much fun this is
the ref swoops in
randy kicks out
as randy recovers the ayatollah jumps out of the ring and grabs a folding chair
the ayatollah climbing back in props up the chair in a corner
he picks randy off the mat and flings him at the chair
randy vaults over it sailing through the ropes and out of the ring
he hits the concrete floor crashing against the metal barricade
she starts to tear up a little
the ayatollah hops out of the ring
he stands over randy kicking him repeatedly
he grabs his iranian flag waving it tauntingly at the crowd
fat piece of shit
the ayatollah looks down at randy
spits on randy pitiful godless infidel
boos rain down on the ayatollah
the ayatollah takes the butt end of his flag pole and jabs it into randys side
randy grimaces in pain
the ayatollah unties the flag from its pole and wraps it around randys neck
he jerks upward on the flag lifting randy off the mat by his neck
randy thrashes around fighting for breath
the ayatollah releases randy from the choke
randy crumples to the ground gasping for air
the ayatollah picks up randy by his hair and flings him back in the ring
the ayatollah grabs the folding chair from the corner
he smashes randy over the head with it
randys forehead is bleeding
the ayatollah hits him again taking dead aim at the forehead cut
randy crumples to the mat
cassidy alarmed instinctively goes halfway toward the ring
the ayatollah scoops up randy and bodyslams him
he falls on randy knee first and starts punching him repeatedly
under breath wanna take it home
randys eyes drift in cassidys direction
randys pov cassidy is crying
stop it randy
randy turns back to the ayatollah
all you bro
lead the way
randy flips the ayatollah over
randy struggles to his feet
he picks up the ayatollah and levels him with a dropkick
a second one and another
a third one and another
his heart is pounding
the fans sense its near the end
a chant rises ram jam
randy falls on top of the ayatollah putting him in a rest move headlock
just listen to this crowd
the ayatollah can hear how labored randys breathing is
if you aint up to it
randy looks around at the crowd chanting hungry for the ram jam
he looks the ayatollah in the eye
lets do this
randy gets up
he lifts the ayatollah off the mat locking up with him chest to chest
he arches his back and thrusts his hips
the ayatollahs feet fly off the canvas as his legs whip into the air
his body does a complete flip as he slams onto his back
randy stays with him his body contorting in a tight back flip as he crashes down on top of him
randy gets up
his heart lurches
he lowers himself back down to his knees
puts his hand to his chest
something just happened
randy looks out at the crowd
the whole place is on its feet
randys heart lurches again
the ayatollah sees hes clearly not
just pin me
randy looks out at the crowd again
the fans are in a frenzy
randy is torn
randy staggers to the corner
his heartbeat is unnatural and cassidy cant take any more
she turns and walks
randy plants a foot on the bottom rope
he looks toward cassidy
randys pov he catches a glimpse of cassidy disappearing through the curtain into the locker room
randy looks out on the crowd
he starts to climb
standing on the top rope he looks again at the curtain
cassidy exits the arena sobbing
the ayatollah lies on the ground in pain
randy raises his arms and sticks his elbows out pressing his fists to the sides of his head to form a set of rams horns
uh oh the horns are out
randy takes a long look around the auditorium lingering on the fans faces savoring their cheers
here we go
freeze on randy in mid air glorious and immortal
