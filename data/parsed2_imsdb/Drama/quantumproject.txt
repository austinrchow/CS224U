b if window
href b b a violent electrical storm
veins of light pulse outward branching off into a spidery network of we are inside a human brain
a pack of neurons fire off to the left and rocket their way across synapses to the optic nerve
passing the eye socket they speed toward a silky curvilinear membrane the retina on which we see an image projected neurons ping into the membrane the picture suddenly flips right
side up and we follow the light flashing in a blur through the iris and cornea until exiting the eye we reverse pov and deep deep blue
radiating more intelligence than wisdom
inside each pupil is the reflection of a computer screen
a deferential voice sounds from off camera
twenty nine athletic owlishly handsome
multi tasking again
pentcho raises his blue eyes from the computer screen and up at arlette s his mannish swiss assistant
we can start the descent now
as pentcho and arlette stride through the facility
they pass a group of green tagged visitors and their swiss accented guide
two hundred feet below us is the worlds largest particle accelerator
his voice continues on overlap as they reach a hallway
kilometers in circumference the beam pipe actually runs beneath the borders of switzerland and france
did you get that data off to braverman at cal tech
they are facing the capsule elevator that leads to the tunnel
next to the elevator two plants are dying in their pots their growing lamps off
pentcho looks around finds the plug pushes it into the socket
the lights glow
he peers at a leaf a tiny bug crawls across
at the moment of impact the electrons inside the pipe are travelling six hundred sixty six million miles per we need to progress
he breaks out of it swipes his i
the capsule doors whoosh open
pentcho nods at the man inside
this is jacque his accent heavily italian
hey it is p o
p p p
professore paulo pentcho
thats not an official nickname jacque
pentcho looks from jacque to arlette who blushes
pentcho sits down in the heavily consoled captains chair
eets just tun nel humor
the giant lab disappears from sight as they drop twenty stories below the earth
did they recalibrate the k turn
they hit bottom
pentcho keys in data on the console computer as the capsule moves laterally on a track parallel to the beam pipe stopping in front of the rf cavity bursting with
a billion dollars worth of nanotechnology
give me more angle control on the bounce
on pentcho a little bored manning the console
fifteen seconds arlette
the camera surges forward into pentchos eyes we see an image draw itself on the empty page of the field accompanied by the following thought text
two spatially separated particles will irresistibly attract
wide set brown eyes brimming with emotion
a hint of a song playing somewhere in the bg
to the previous page where the loop has formed into a sheet moving through space followed by the floating thought text
until the force of the collision fuses them into
ten nine eight
the brown eyed woman her face dreamy her body naked beneath silk sheets
pull back shes floating on an enormous renaissance mural a wedding scene that is a bedroom floor
off in the corner pentcho sits hunched over a clunky laptop his fingers dancing dervish like across the keyboard
four three two
suddenly the woman drifts away
pentcho looks up their pentchos finger depresses the start button
as we follow the pulse signal from the keyboard to the cpu across the local area network to the mainframe in the rf cavity sending its own signal into the
beam pipe where two soon to be accelerated electrons are released like horses bolting from the same starting gate but in opposite directions
the roller coaster ride begins
blasting through the beam pipe like a comet fused inside of a looping twenty seven kilometer single lane race track
as the electron accelerates so too does the sound rushing to gut splitting ear wrenching dbs
heading around the turn it barrels straight into the path of the second electron on its own speed of light power surge
here comes the impact point
what disc brakes might sound like slammed to the floor of a vehicle travelling six hundred sixty six million miles per hour
its phosphorescent glow trained like a spotlight on the dual computer screens reflecting out of his pupils again
a voice speaks from nowhere sonorous and packed with reverb the camera surges into pentchos eyes as the brain field opens to the sounds of a nine alarm fire
ding ding ding ding ding
the thought text marches by in giant attention getting letters electrons dont more thought text scrolls by on the field now in red letters im having a psychotic episode
the field collapses back into pentcho ashen faced watching his computer screen and seeing the cursor electron blinking
suddenly we are back inside the pipe hurtling toward a particle meteor shower of magnificent proportions
they glow and charge off and disappear as the laws of e mc take visual flight inside this billion dollar kaleidoscope
staring out the window not really seeing the clouds as we surge into his eyes and click stacking up windowlike flashbacks with startling ferocity
the glowing electron click arlette multi tasking again
click the capsule doors closing click youre having a psychotic episode click the echo of the electrons voice what do you puts down a drink glass on the tray table
of the seat next to him
places headphones onto his ears
fiddles with the music channels country stand up classical
stays put on a mozart concerto
he gazes back out at the clouds fails to notice that sliding slowly across the tray table
it stops near the edge and waits as pentcho looks up from the window
as his head drifts back toward the clouds outside pentchos plane touches down
on the freeway heading for berkeley in eternal rush hour
stop go sixty miles per hour then five then thirty
pentcho drives distracted stares at his own eyes reflected in the rear view mirror
the camera surges in click its pentcho himself on the airplane listening to mozart
in the foreground the tray table and glass
in the bg his eyes fixed aimlessly on the clouds outside
suddenly pentchos face one stays focused forward while the second one turns to the side and watches in amazement as suddenly a horn blares and crash
slams into the car in front of him triggering a three car collision with pentcho in the middle an object lesson in physics seen from ten different camera angles bumpers
crumple metal tears human molecules snap forward
pop pop pop
like gunfire bullet airbags clamp the drivers heads back against their headrests
the field rocks sideways in total overload so flooded with messages that each one is undecipherable
the three cars form a tangled metal sculpture
incredibly as pentcho himself sees they are all red vw beetles
he sits in a daze
a mans voice interrupts scaling up into a shout
what the hell were you thinking
i want to know
this is will s a scratch over one eye peering in at pentcho still behind the air bag steering wheel craning his stiffening neck forward and back at the crumpled
row of red automobiles
he blinks then answers in an eerie voice
probability of this happening same make model color and year is less likely than the proof for the existence of god
seething sorry i asked
beat you got insurance
a tow truck backs up to pentchos car
he stands dazed off on the shoulder luggage next to him
his eyes drift toward will giving instructions into his cell phone
up the ramp
ill he turns there you are
they wont let you in
here i am
he waves at a red dodge durango on the street below
pentcho stares idly at the durango as we the picture is blurry but the song clear
i know this world is kil
on a man and a woman making love on a big brocade couch
their bodies rock in unison faces unseen
my aim is true ooooh
the field collapses closed upon a woman from the durango is approaching as will back on the phone argues with his boss
ill be there trent
will reddens sees the sunglassed face of the woman looking past him and over to pentcho signing the tow truck papers
the battered front end of his beetle cranks upward
son of a bitch
as if it was my fault i got rear ended by
the woman stares curiously at pentcho
some schmuck dreaming about god
she doesnt hear him
takes off her sunglasses slowly
wide set brown eyes
finished now with the tow truck driver
his head turns
she moves closer
wills voice protests from the bg
overlapped by another photograph that slowly comes into focus top third middle third bottom like a downloading internet image from his personal files
pentchos heartbeat pounds louder drowning out the whisper then goodbye
they lock into a stare the molecules around them swirling with emotion
barely audible less likely than the existence of god
mia brushes back a strand of hair
bites her lip
ive been dreaming about you
day or night
pentcho loses himself in her brown eyes
atoms are vibrating interchanging by the billions
another voice gets in the way
is that your
beat not yet
she shifts her weight from one slim leg to the other
could we go somewhere
im heading out of town
deep breath okay
mia does a tiny double take
its very sexy
i could go out of town
this is so preposterous
nodding where to
a place youve never been
thats the physicists playground
will slams the durango door shut and stalks into the store
as the durango motors into the alpine landscape
mia turns looks at her former lover
he stares back smiles
why am i doing this
its an experiment
mia turns onto a private road
a mansion appears in the distance cresting the hill
a ext int
xanadu night a a massive wooden door
mia holds a flashlight slips an oversized key into the lock and turns
an enormous hall
scaffolding rises from the stone floor
forty foot high walls are draped in thick sheets of plastic
they enter like thieves
xanadu a short time later b mia stands on top of an eight foot riser
pentcho passes up harnesses and rope to her outstretched hands
we flopped the first time out
at the sub atomic level particles obey their own logic
they connect in unimaginable ways
mia slings the gear over her shoulder
looks very much in her element
and you think this is relevant to our relationship
pentcho starts his own climb up the scaffolding
reaches the first plank
wryly what universe are you in paul
a quantum one
a higher scaffolding a short time later c pentcho clips a safety line to his belt
the two of them wear yellow hardhats and climbing harnesses
they suddenly kick off the scaffold and dangle twenty five feet above the stone floor
hand over fist they start to ascend hoisting themselves up the tug ropes
the shorthand is when you send electrons through space its impossible to say precisely what they are particles or waves
they spin around slowly like tops as they hoist themselves up
they come into being as one or the other at the moment we observe them
his words echo off the giant walls
nothing is real until its perceived
the buddhists have been saying that for a millennium
mia reaches an electric box hanging a yard below the ceiling
baby reality is what you choose to make it
she flips the switch
a set of lights flare on
pentcho swallows a breath
flocks of angels fly above a goddess
pentchos face flushes
she takes note but only if you live your life that way
if you experience every moment as discovery
pentchos already there
he kicks his legs out
joyrides on the tug rope arcing back and forth like a mad pendulum
youre restoring heaven with dabs of paint
youre bringing new order to the universe
she beams from his excitement
i always said we were in the same business
his wayward motion swings him straight into her
they lock arms
the ropes shudder
if youre right we have a chance
beat to be together
pentcho reaches out to kiss her
doesnt see that their collision has jogged the clutch on his harness rope
now it opens all the way
in an instant hes gripping air falling at the speed of newtons discovery
he hurtles downward in slow motion
theres a sound rushing in behind him the rumble of a mega earthquake
pentcho catches a glimpse up over his shoulder the angels the goddess mia all of it has been as pentchos eyes stare for a millisecond at and then hes falling
again accelerating toward his own last particle collision when a voice murmurs from somewhere
im not done
the safety line holds dangling pentcho a meter above the stone floor
xanadu some time later d they camp on old couch cushions side by side staring up at the illuminated fresco
pentcho is bruised battered vulnerable
when i was a kid i used to snap my head back like a gunfighter on the draw hoping to catch a glimpse behind me
mia props her head up on one elbow
the eternal nothingness
its a plea
she turns stares directly into his eyes
the universe is snapping my head back
im losing my focus
mias face fills with light
her best smile
she traces a line from his forehead to the bridge of his nose quoting yeats from the second coming as a celebration things fall apart the center will not hold
mere anarchy is loosed upon the world
he pulls her close to him
they lie spooned together breathing in unison gazing up at the painted heaven
a firefly enters from outside flutters in the air above them blushing a trace line of yellow light
an electron spoke to me yesterday
beat i swear
mia tries to suppress a giggle
what did it want
thats what it asked me
what do you want
i didnt answer
i was in the middle of an experiment
he hesitates then surrenders to the fact
the firefly dances above them
pentcho sits up and away from her
mock serious did you know electrons have lovers
mia notes his distance
faces him cross legged
dryly im listening
inside every semi conductor
you have two particles with opposite charges separated by an impassable barrier
she looks sees him disappear into his head
a strip of silicon which for you and me would be like
the vulnerability is gone
and mia with it
shes in l
hes in the bay area plowing ahead a five hundred foot thick steel wall
but the connection between these two electrons is so dysfunctional that they tunnel magically through any obstacle defying the practical laws of physics in order to end up together and
glow happily ever after
the story hangs between them like a fog
dont science me paul
beat what do you want
on pentchos face its blank
mia looks up at the angels closes her eyes turns away
the durango pulls up stops
pentcho gets deposited on the curb
barely closes the door before the car speeds away
he looks up
sees the sign on the bus stop bench love never fails corinthians storm clouds gather over the ocean
a taxi stops in front of a two story cottage looking abandoned in the wet weather
pentcho walks out passing his dented vw beetle in the driveway
ascends a flight of brick steps to the an alternately stark and cluttered space less lived in than occupied by a man on the run between his office and his
rivulets of water run from an open window across a large desk and down onto the wood floor
pentcho scans around unfazed
locates a towel
dries off the computer and keyboard
bag still on his shoulder he fires up the machine and logs e mail
lots of it
hundreds and hundreds of messages scrolling by on the screen
he turns away sees his own rain soaked clothes forming a puddle on the floor
lightning cascades across the sky visible through the large bay window behind the desk
pentchos eyes stray back to the screen as the thunder follows almost immediately
he looks up veins of light pulse outward branching into a spidery network a voice sounds from somewhere non local paul
pentcho leans toward the glass looking out as we reverse pov a single lightning bolt descends from the heavens on its own speed of light path straight at
it strikes the beetle dead on slow motion scorching the roof
reverse pov on pentcho pupils dilated as we surge inward to wild white einstein hair
he clutches suddenly at his chest like a heart attack victim
his lips call out but no voice follows
he fades ominously to black at the sound of pentcho blinks once his face illuminated by a dozen flashes of lightning
he touches his fingers to the glass on the exact same path toward
the red beetle
a plume of smoke rises out of the punctured roof
pentcho sits in his window seat staring at the open tray table next to him
theres a glass
it doesnt move
stock shot landing in lax a the plane touches down
we see the landmark spider restaurant
pentcho crosses the lot with the rent a car employee
rented every last ve hicle
ill take it
its a red beetle
the sign says hollywood north
long beach san pedro south
the rain has stopped
the red bug parks in front of a ditto the neighborhood
a eleven sign blinks on the corner
pentcho walks up the cracked sidewalk to a sagging wooden porch
looks for signs of life
he pushes on the front door
rummages through his key ring in the dark
slides one into the top lock
tries another key
he pulls it out
presses his face close against the window
pentcho turns his eyes lit by the flashing bubble lights
crumpled on the floor hands still clutching his chest
the screen collapses at the sound of foreign voices jabbering at high speed
policemen bark back on loudspeakers
pentcho raps on the glass
a thunk sounds from inside
or was it
he picks one last key out in the glare of the blue lights
jams it in the lock
twists and bursts into the darkened foyer
his foot catches on a thick doormat
he sprawls forward as he drops convulsed with fear
snaps his head back to see in bathrobe and slippers hands shaking around a shotgun
pentcho struggles to breathe
i thought you were dead
alexander drops the gun
in shock a whisper i must be
alexander recomposed marches to the burners
theres anger in his every movement
this is no feeble old man
he pours tea like he was filling shot glasses
look at me
pentcho stirs in a lump of sugar first
raises his eyes
contemptuous alexander the great
he lifts a kitchen chair spins it around straddles the back
i built the first machine to transfer digital bits over a land line
i wrote the tcp ip protocol before thirty
this mind tapping his temples the one and only was obgyn at the birth of the internet
and where has it taken me
he shoots upright
peers out the row of double sash windows covered by impenetrable iron grates
to an armed camp
to a biblical spoof of a crazed father firing a gun at his only son
you taking any medication
alexanders eyes flare in anger
dont waste it pauly
this is not an everyday talk
just input the information and ask relevant questions
one how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me pulling the gun out to this particular switching station
he shoves the shotgun into an open trash can
two what if i didnt miss
spare me your classical answer
what if i didnt miss
you did miss what if your seven and a half precious liters were downloading over the parquet floor
softer what did your life mean
beat who did you nurture pauly
who did you love
pentcho shifts uncomfortably in his seat
ditto alexanders mood
he does a startling one eighty into nonchalance
what was her name
what was her name
the one i met
alexander reaches out a finger touches the dab of paint on pentchos forehead
he rubs the paint between his fingers
now he wanders off disappears into the dark
on pentcho wired incredulous heart thump thump thumping
he calls out after his father
i need some air
beat dont shoot me
pentcho paces in front of the open window stops
he turns to walk out is surprised by standing in the dark
weve been kidding ourselves pauly
until you look for it it doesnt even exist
pentcho slogs down the wharf
running from it
looking for it
past homeless people slipping in and out of the shadows
he snaps his head back over his shoulder sees an old woman playing the accordian
her eyes bore in on his own
you would have a son with me
the woman is suddenly fifty years younger and his name would be hope
numbers fly up on the field are inscribed erased considered and measured
pentchos own voice is heard on overlap if you could look back fast enough at near to the speed of light then there would be no reality behind you because
it hadnt yet been created bellows in the dark
pentcho twists his head forward spots blinking above a tatto parlor
his eyes lock on see the heart its electric pulse mimicing the beating of a real organ
running from it
looking for it
he stops dead in his tracks tries one last time to play gunfighter with the quantum reality and we see him making the same move from four different camera angles
from his left his right from the top of his head and looking up from ground zero as the rumble of a mega earthquake is unleashed
here it comes rolling in with a giant whooshing sound
the ships the dock the harbor obliterated by an onrushing transparent cloud of nothingness emptiness a tabula rasa superimposed upon the disappeared wharf
hammered by his own victory numb from shock and ecstasy staring into the void as we surge forward its completely blank just like the void
the vitals are flatlined
a single piece of thought text floats across the emptiness almost like a screen saver say uncle
a face peering down at pentcho
the face belongs to the magic man in a mad hatter hat and a potpourri of found item clothing
like a baptist preacher on his sidewalk pulpit can you feel it uncle
can you feel it right down to your bones
inside each pupil is the reflection of the neon heart
we pull back on pentchos face
beat yes i can
pentcho turns the key effortlessly opens the front door
he stands beneath the stream of hot water cleansing himself of a day that began a very long time ago
pentcho dresses taking in the smell and texture of fresh clothes against his body
he sits down on the bed
sees a clock
tugs up one of the double sash windows that faces the eleven
voices rise from the parking lot
pentcho stretches out on the musty bedspread eyes on the carved plaster ceiling
suddenly floating up through the open window what do you want
pentcho cranes his head
the old sash falls shut
its like a dam bursting inside him only the flood is laughter that starts deep in his belly as a giggle then a chuckle that cascades upward and out into
the sound rocks the house
pentchos smile is a mile wide
his eyes sparkle then tear up as the he jumps off the bed and bounds down the stairs
alexanders already there ushering mia inside to pentcho arrives
he stops incredulous at the sight of her
guess whos coming to dinner
mia jumps right in
to pentcho i didnt want to leave things the way we did
not this time
i want to tell you something
he takes her arm steering her away from alexander into the living room
she stops cold at the sight of the mural
ive been dreaming about this
excited then you get it
his face has the look of the little boy who has just stumbled upon the pirates treasure
i know what i want
i let go and a second later you materialized at the door
feeling the feelings
i can create reality
beat i can choose to love you with all my heart
tears pool along the rims of her eyes
she stares straight at him hiding nothing
you know those people who wont be photographed because theyre afraid youre stealing their souls
long beat i came to take back my picture
the one i keep leaving with you
his heart deflates
his voice follows
barely audible why
so i can move on
a horn blares from outside
be who you are paul
i love who you are
she turns and runs out the front door
mia runs down to the curb where where boyfriend will holds open the passenger door of the red durango
she circles the car disappears behind the wheel
will gets in his side
pentcho agitated pushes open the door
alexanders already outside watching mia motor off
he turns stares at his son
do you want to think about it some more
pentcho sprints down to the curb
jumps into the beetle
the headlights flash on in the pre dawn night
mia grips the wheel with two hands
will feigns nonchalance
they merge onto the highway
pentcho grips the wheel
we surge into whose shape recalls the original brain field
thought text scrolls below accompanied now by pentchos own inner voice
each part of physical reality is constructed of all the other parts
inside of which the entire strand is reflected
a web of connections created by the interdependence of all things
the field collapses back into eyes on the rear view mirror as a horn blares from the entrance to the long beach bridge
she re checks the mirror filled with bobbing headlight beams
one beam locks on straight into the center of the glass blinding her for a split second
gasps to herself as the beam seems to and train its phosphorescent glow on the point of light reflecting out of her pupils
pentchos voice speaks from nowhere sonorous and packed with reverb what do you want
mia blinks again
the beam is gone
she looks over at will oblivious checking his watch
the understanding flooding her eyes as and we see her making her move from four different camera angles from her left right up above and from the back seat of
the car as the rumble of a mega earthquake whooshes by
all sucked out of existence until nothing remains but triggering a chain reaction of vehicles fish tailing across the bridge
in quick succession come a stream of images the pearls colliding
mia and will exchanging a look
traffic halting on the bridge
will getting scorched by the man they plowed into
mia exiting her side looking back behind her
pentcho ditching his beetle ten car lengths south
he runs forward straight down the path of a tunnel like headlight beam
mia picks up speed churning from the other direction
as the two of them move toward the same point
suddenly tiny sparks of light glow and jump from portions of the bridge cable
gliding still closer
a voice sounds impact
their bodies connect arms intertwine lips touch lips
