pause man contd two lumps
close in on two couples in the audience beth and calvin and their friends
the women are amused the men trying to keep awake
so i dont know everything about you
i dont know your favorite movie stars
i cant remember the name of your favorite perfume
i have racked my brain and i cant remember
its my sin
audience laughs alvin wakes up and behaves
gives a conventional smile to his wife beth
but i do know in the last twenty four years that i have never been out of love with you
the four of them come out of the theater
the women walk together in front men behind

car door alarm on car door alarm off as car doors open and close
beth goes upstairs and directly into her bedroom
calvin notices this then notices the light under his sons bedroom door
conrad is lying on his stomach on his bed thinking
he composes himself grabs his book as if he had been reading
calvin opens the door but does not enter the room respecting his sons privacy you okay

calvin shrugs as if to say so and so
burning the midnight oil
pause calvin contd you thought about calling that doctor
well the months up

the plan was if i needed to call him

by the way i am working on those michigan state tickets
calvin closes the door
conrad reflects then shuts off light
calvin shuts off bedside lamp
then kisses beth
beth prepares the breakfast table geometrically cu

beth contd because i want to get away

you talked to him about it
does he want to go to london
i dont think he knows what he wants to do

beth joins the two women and man what are these hushed tones all about
he just told the funniest joke
calvin laughs with two male guests
man with grey hair passes him im not talking to you

calvin talks with man red tie striped cream wearing glasses i ran into billy white
bob mc leans leaving coles and johnson
where is he going
he doesnt know
beth is laughing adressing man with grey hair no
youre so mean
isnt he the meanest man youve met
a guest man talks golf with a woman
when a ball is in play if a player his partner their equipment or their caddies accidentally move it
birthday cake comes in with candles cu hes a jolly good fellow for hes a jolly good fellow wont regret cant forget what we did for love beth and other
women and gathered around the piano
they are a little drunk are singing a little false
annie a guest with red blouse is sitting on the steps of the stairs eating out of her plate
calvin comes and sits next to her
whats your boy up to these days
they wont tell
hows conrad doing
i asked donald and he says they havent talked much
i said maybe hes a little self conscious
a woman in green going upstairs drunk trips over calvin oh
the woman goes upstairs
calvin contd no no
beth not far listens
calvin contd theres a doctor in highland park
that he sees a couple of times a week
that kinda cuts into his social life
calvin contd hes great

oh no no
nothing like that
no no just somebody to talk to
kind of polish off the rough edges thats all
beth joins in to cut him off
how are you
is he falling asleep on you yet
beth looks uptight and scornful
calvin notices it
you drink too much at parties calvin
im not drunk
why did you tell annie marshall that conrad is seeing a psychiatrist
well for one thing i dont think people hear that kind of thing very easily
come on for most people its a status symbol right up there with going to europe
well i thought your blurting it out like that was in very bad taste
i did not think it was that
not to mention a violation of privacy
beth is strangely vehement
the familys privacy
i think it is a very private matter
bergers office day conrad sits in an armchair very nervous scratching his leg
so what do i do
tell you my dreams
i dont hold much stock in dreams
what kind of a psychiatrist are you
they all believe in dreams
whats going on
i just feel
i feel so
i dont know
i do believe in dreams
only sometimes i want to know whats happening when youre awake
come on somethings bugging you making you nervous
youre making me nervous
maybe i need a tranquilizer
what do you think
i think you came in here looking like something out of the body snatchers
its not my impression that you need a tranquilizer
conrad notices a cube on the table
what is this
oh i see
so you get to tell the time but i cant
is that it
so you know when the hours up
fifty minutes fifty five minutes
what is it
dr berger doesnt answer
conrad contd maybe
maybe i dont want to swim anymore
you know i mean my timing is for shit
you know hes got two guys that swim the fifty theyre better than me and
theyre a bunch of boring ass jocks
i cant stand him
hes a tight ass son of a bitch
have you ever thought about quitting
are you telling me to
it wouldnt look good
forget about how it looks
how does it feel
how does it feel
how does it feel
how does it feel
how does it feel
its the same thing that happened last year
its the same damn thing i did last year
are you the same person you were last year
i dont know
thats why you need a tranquilizer
you tell me
its up to you
fifty bucks an hour cant you decide if i should have a pill or not
i mean youre a doctor im supposed to feel better
dr berger contd how is it with your friends
is it getting any easier
its still hard

waiter brings two cokes karen contd thank you

you dont miss leos corny jokes
she looks at him sternly
are you seeing a doctor
im seeing a doctor
uh well dr
crawford gave me a name and i went for a while
it just didnt work for me i guess
he just kept telling me all the things i already knew and uh
finally i decided
the only one who can help me is myself
at least thats what my dad says
i dont mean its not right for you conrad
i mean i think that if its something you want to do thats what you should be doing
well ya i dont know how long ill keep it up
i sorta got shoved into it
pause your hair grew in
that was such a dumb thing to do
i like it
i dont know i just
i miss it sometimes the hospital
things have to change
but thats where we had the laughs
but that was a hospital
this is the real world
yeah yeah i

she gets up karen contd mmm

you mean it
you look good
then stops a few steps away and shouts hey
a customer is startled
karen contd would you cheer up
conrad sits there with a strange feeling of embarrassment reflecting
from inside beth stares outside in the garden where conrad is lying on a chaise lounge
she comes out
its cold out here
you should put that on or do you want a sweater
do i need one
beth is taken off guard by conrads reaction doesnt know what to do
what are you doing
not about anything
your hair is starting to grow out
pause i was thinking about the pigeon
you know the one that used to hang around the garage
how it used to get on top of your car and he take off when you pulled out of the driveway
yeah i remember
i remember how scared i used to get
flap flap flap flap
every time i started the car
that was the closest we ever came to having a pet
you remember buck asked you he tried to talk you into
getting a dog
do you remember that
how about it if its the size of a little football
that animal next door that pepper or pippin whatever its name is
hes not a very friendly dog
i dont care what mr
what he really wanted was a everytime time that dog retriever
it was down the comes into this backyard i street for sale
thats what try to get him out
he barks arf
beth stops in her tracks startled but doesnt show it
put that on if youre gonna stay out here okay
conrad stays alone a while and stares
then goes inside
conrad enters hesitantly back from garden
beth is busy dressing up the table
can i help
oh you mean with this
casually no i tell you what you can do though
you can go upstairs to that room of yours and clean out the closet
because it really is a mess
they stand there facing each other uptight
the telephone rings
beth goes over to it picks it up seems suddenly delighted
beth contd hello
yeah no i didnt get there
i was swamped with work
how did it go
no no im not doing anything just getting ready for dinner
beth laughs to a gossip
conrad is devastated
beth contd did she really
beth laughs again
echo effect to get into flashback beth is laughing at buck story
she is lying leisurely on a mattress on the lawn
buck is standing telling his story
oh anyway mary ann ramon started to just scream just cry right
it was crazy
we got so drunk that we couldnt talk to each other
it was the last day
the last day of school
a younger conrad sitting aside is listening too amused
buck contd we walked out of the building in the middle of the class
conrad stares at beth laughing on the phone
the gossip gets too funny
bergers office evening what do you expect from her
we just dont connect
i dont know
we just dont
silence what are you thinking
that i jack off a lot
so what else is new
does it help
for a minute
silence what now
you know in the waltons
what about him
my father came into my room and he didnt know what to say
this is right after buck died
and he came over and sat on the bed next to me put his arm around my shoulder
we just sat there
i remember i was watching his shoe
cos his shoe was turned over on its side
i was thinking hes so uptight its gonna crack off
dr berger listens carefully
conrad contd and i knew i should have felt something
but i didnt know what to feel
i kept thinking what they say on tv you know stuff like
conrad contd oh no noo
ooh my god
but i didnt say that
because i didnt feel sad
so much as
so much as what
i kept thinking that john boy wouldve said something
about the way he felt you know
what would john boy have said
i dont know
conrad seems lost
dr berger is on to something
dr berger contd come on
come on what
dont hold back
silence calvin walks with his business partner ray hanley seen at the party
at least shes an improvement
she doesnt crack gum in your face
thats what you get when your partner does the hiring and firing
oh im sorry
thats my fault
i just can never seem to tell anybody that theyre not making it
hold hold it
wait a minute
thats not the problem
where are you
ive been losing you these days
oh im sorry
you off the track
ive known you for twenty years
you think i cant tell when somethings wrong
connies all right
look i am sorry its none of my business but i think you worry too much
youve been on the rack about him long enough
youre making it a habit
youve gotta let him go sometime
im not on the rack about him
the thing about it is in a year hell be gone
off to michigan or harvard or wherever in the hell he gets it in his head he wants to go
maybe hell decide to take a tour of europe for a year and not even go to school at all
i cant argue with who knows
im just try giving you the benefit of my experience
with valerie its more than her living away from home
got her own friends her own life
she breezes in
for a couple of days on vacations but
i dont know maybe girls are different
or maybe she was too aware of what was happening between nance and me
but they leave
and all that worrying doesnt amount to a hill of crap

calvin is troubled
going home on the commuter calvin is thoughtful
he remembers his sons when they were kids

calvin realizes he has to get off
another training session at the swimming pool
conrad is heavily swimming in his lane although he looks tired and bored not really fit for training
he stops exhausted at the end of a row looks at his friends happily discussing by the side of the pool then at coach salan in his office glass booth
overlooking the swimming pool
coach salan is sermonning conrad in his office glass booth overlooking the swimming pool

beth gets up goes to the table and starts preparing the sandwiches
beth contd that was dumb

beth shows her mother the two pieces of the plate and puts them together
you know i think this can be saved
its a nice clean break
the choir is rehearsing
altos that last e natural could be just a little higher
officers dont forget your meeting tonight
jeannine looks at conrad
jeannine in school corridor still singing
mmm mm mmm mmm mm mmm mmm mmm mmm mm mmm
jeannine stops to drink some water at the tap of the fountain
conrad see her when he is already too near and has almost his coat on
seeing an opportunity to talk to her he steps back takes off his coat while she is not looking then passes her putting on his coat as if he was
naturally on his way out
jeannine notices conrad passing by
you are really a terrific tenor
you should be doing the solo in that russian thing
you really sing well
im getting to know your voice
how can you hear me sing if youre singing
i dont always sing
sometimes i just listen
for instance marcia blair cant sing a note
janet fox only mouths the words and never sings
ha a detective

what kind of music do you like
spoon on a glass
spoon on a
jeannine contd oh you mean like

why is it so hard
the first time you talk to somebody
you make it look easy
jeannine is touched
jeannine looks at him then jeannine contd oh thats my bus i got to go
she runs and gets into the bus
conrad follows and see her gets into the bus
jeannine contd ill see you later
and youre really a terrific tenor
singing like a tenor ah
youre just saying that
bus goes away
conrad contd alleluia
conrad goes home through park
ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha alleluia
conrad enters his room still singing in a low voice
he browses quickly through a pocket book finds the piece of paper inserted in it picks up phone and dials the number written on the paper hello
is karen there
whos calling please
its a friend of hers from hillsboro
not home from school yet
just tell her i called
this is conrad
just tell her i called and im feeling great and i just wanted to talk to her
conrad walks nervously around to and fro for a while then looks up into directory
he finds jeannine number writes it down pratt then picks up the phone
all right conrad hangs up and rehearses what he is going to say but he is yet too shy to call
conrad contd hello
this is conrad
jeannine this is conrad
this is conrad
what a dumb name
this is bill
conrad takes courage and dials jeannine number
hello this is conrad calling
realizing more enthusiastic oh
i was wondering if maybe youd like
to go out sometime
you mean with you
like on a date
well yeah we wouldnt have to call it a real date
we could fake it sort of to see how it goes
that was dumb
just forget it
now start over
hi this is conrad jarrett
interrupting id love to
happy music calvin and conrad happily come back home with a christmas tree on top of car
christmas tree standing in living room ready to be decorated
bet silently comes in
calvin finally notices she is here
i didnt see you there
what do you think
rawlins used to have such great scotch pines
and they all look like skeletons this year
conrad comes in with a box of chritsmas tree decorations hi
what do you think
cold very nice
conrad and calvin stop at the tone of her voice
cold why dont you ask him whats wrong
maybe you wont have to hear it from carol lazenby
dad i quit the swim team
carol thought i knew
cos why wouldnt i
it happened over a month ago
where have you been every night
the library mostly
why didnt you tell us connie
i dont know i didnt think it mattered
what do you mean
why wouldnt it matter
of course it matters
interrupting no that was meant for me calvin
what was meant for you
its really important to try to hurt me
dont you have that backwards
and how do i hurt you
by embarrassing you in front of a friend
she has no idea what her son is up to
he lies and she believes every word of it
i didnt lie
you lied everytime you came into this house at
if its starting all over again the lying the covering up the disappearing for hours i will not stand for it
i cant stand it
i really cant
well dont then
go to europe
cos the only reason she cares the only reason she gives a fuck about it
is because someone else knew about it first
just stop it connie
you tell her to stop it
you never tell her a godamn thing
and i know why she never came to the hospital shes busy going to goddamn spain and
why should she care if im hung up by the balls out there
maybe this is how they sit around and talk at the hospital but were not at the hospital now
you never came to the hospital
how do you know she never came
you know she came but she had the flu and couldnt come inside but she came
she wouldnt have had any flu if buck was in the hospital
she would have come if buck was in the hospital
buck never wouldve been in the hospital
conrad takes his head between his hands and runs upstairs
that is enough
i wont do it again
i really wont do it
what in hell has happened
upstairs conrads bedroom door slams
calvin contd somebody better go up there
oh god thats the pattern isnt it
he walks all over us and then you go up and apologize to him
i am not going to apologize
yes of course you are
you always do
youve been apologizing to him ever since he got home from the hospital only you dont see it
i am not apologizing
im trying to goddamn understand him
dont talk to me that way
dont you talk to me the way he talks to you
lets not fight
lets go upstairs
calvin goes but beth doesnt and turns away
calvin enters conrads bedroom and closes the door
conrad is lying on his stomach feeling all crooked
his voice is muffled by his head between his arms
i want to talk to you
i need to sleep
in a minute
i didnt mean it
i didnt mean any of it
i am sorry
please dont be mad
im not mad
im just trying to figure out what happened down there
i dont know what happened
i am sorry about it all
i am sorry about the whole thing
what i said i didnt mean it
just please tell her
tell her im sorry will you
why dont you tell her
oh god no i cant
dont you see
i cant talk to her
because it doesnt change anything
it doesnt change the way she looks at me
she was upset conrad
your mother was hurt because you quit the swim team
i dont understand it myself
i dont mean just now
dont you see
i dont mean just today
explain it to me
everything is german pudding with you dad
you dont see things
calvin contd what things
please i want you to tell me
that she hates me
cant you see that
your mother doesnt hate you conrad
all right all right
please leave me alone now
then calvin stands up and goes to the door
what about this dr
do you think hes helping you
dont blame it on burger its not his fault
calvin opens the door
ill be downstairs if you need me
conrad remains lying on his back with his arm over his eyes
bergers office evening tuesday you felt great
you bought a christmas tree it was all hunky dory
youre the doctor
dont take refuge in one liners like youre the doctor
because that pisses me off
so everything was fine till you had the fight with your mother then everything was lousy
yeah but i dont blame her
i mean shes got
shes got her reasons
its impossible after all the shit ive pulled
what shit have you pulled
im talking proportion here
now what shit
dr berger contd come on
you must be able to come up with at least one example
and dont give me i tried to kill myself thats old turkey
what have you done lately
hey come on if you
listen im never gonna be forgiven for that
you know you cant get it out you know all the blood in her towels in her rug
everything had to be pitched
even the tiles in the bathroom had to be regrouted
christ she fired the godamn maid because she couldnt dust the living room right
if you think im gonna forgive
that shes gonna forgive me
berger looks at conrad to signal him he just said something conrad realizes he just made a freudian slip looks at him what
conrad stands up reflects looks outside window
i think i just figured something out
who it is who cant forgive who
well a real problem
a real problem has a real solution
ive heard this all before
doesnt make it any less true
im so tired
thats a hell of a secret youve been keeping on yourself
so what do i do now
recognize her limitations
you mean like she cant love me
oh kiddo no
like she cant love you enough
like dont blame her for not loving you more than shes able
but she loves my father
i know she loved my brother
now were back to the rotten kid routine
she cant love you because youre unlovable
where does that leave your dad
how come he loves you
youre a rottenkid doesnt he know that
he feels responsible
besides he loves everybody
ho i get it
the guys got no taste
he loves you but hes wrong
maybe she just cant express it the way youd like her to
maybe shes just afraid to show you what she feels
what do you mean
i mean theres someone besides your mother youve got to forgive
you mean me
conrad is wondering
conrad contd for trying to off myself
dont you sit there and stare at me
why dont you give yourself a break
let yourself off the hook
what did i do
conrad contd what did i do
well talk about it on thursday
what do you mean
youre gonna pull the plug
what did i do
come on con
you know the rules
cant i have a few minutes
you think about it
just think about it
conrad is out of breath
calvin and friend are jogging in sportswear
calvins friend explains a stock market deal he made
after going to a new high it falls to and then rallies on good volume
i shoot an order to buy at the market
if i get the shares at i know somethings wrong
friend contd but suppose the order to buy the shares i put in at the price of i get at at and the rest on the way up so the
last shares i pay then i know im right
im going to peel off here
friend leaves calvin and runs toward his home
ill see you cal
see you later
now calvin is running through the park alone
different voices are echoing off screen
suppose the order to buy at
he walks all over us and you go up there and apologize to him
its all german pudding with you dad you dont see things
youve been apologizing to him ever since he came home from the hospital
and you just dont see that
tell her to stop it
you never tell her a godamn thing
buck never would have been in the hospital
she hates me
cant you see that
calvin trips and falls in dead leaves
he sits up thoughtfull
i want to be clear
bergers office evening calvin laughs nervously all smiles
in the car i was thinking be clear
i suppose thats what psychiatrys about
being precise and clear
and honest of course
ill level with you
im not a great believer in psychiatry
i know what happens here is only between you and him and
i like that i respect that
hes better i can see that
i am not trying to put you down i just dont believe in psychiatry as a panacea for everybody
neither do i
i wish i knew what the hell i was doing here
well you said you
thought you could shed some light on some things
what did you mean by that
i dont know actually im not sure i think i meant in terms of conrad
you see i knew something was wrong even before he tried to
to kill himself
but i thought that
its clear that hes very smart
hes been an a student ever since he started school and naturally i thought that
intelligent people could work out their own problems
but you still feel responsible
yeah sure i do
its hard not to
it was luck
it was just luck that i happened to be there when he tried it
i could have been at a meeting
we both couldve been away
it was luck
you think of yourself as a lucky man then
i used to
i used to think
that i was a lucky person
mmm i guess the whole of life is nothing but an accident is it
what happens to you
i should do with it
that sounds more like the philosophy of a drifter than a tax attorney
maybe maybe i am drifting a little
i can see myself
and i can see the two of them drifting away from me and i just stand there watching
what would you want to do about that
i gotta do something about it
i dont know what
calvin contd i feel like im sitting on a fence and i dont like it
and you see them as on
opposite sides of this fence
i dont know
i see her not being able to forgive him
oh i dont know exactly
being too much like her
people always think that she and buck are
were were alike
but its really she and conrad
they were the only two that didnt cry at the funeral you know
its not easy for me to admit this but uh
his mother doesnt show him a great deal of affection
im not trying to put her down in any way at all
she is a wonderful woman huh
did she give buck much affection to buck
oh god yes she loved buck
bucky got so much
i think what she felt for him was special
you know he was her first born
thats not unusual is it
i loved buck
what i mean is your wifes affection
for me you mean
theres no problem with her for me
weve been married nearly twenty one years
everybody loves beth
for conrad its been difficult
he didnt talk about that
we dont know what happens here
it doesnt come up
i guess thats what it is
its private here
i think i know why i came here
i think i came here to talk about myself
why dont we
calvin sits in the dark in his car behind the wheel not looking too happy
door to garage opens and beth appears
calvin slowly opens the door
car buzzer alarm
calvin heavily comes out
beth contd calvin
buzzing continues beth contd whats the matter
calvin heavily comes out of the car and finally closes door
this will sound strange
what im gonna to say will sound strange
could we talk about bucks funeral
i know itll seem trivial but its on my mind or has been and id just like to talk about it
when i was getting dressed for bucks funeral i was
calvin whats the matter with you
just let me get it off my chest ok
what could getting dressed for bucks funeral possibly have to do with anything right now
i was wearing a blue shirt
and you said wear a white shirt and the other shoes
it was nothing at the time
but its always seemed to stay with me
and i for some reason been thinking about it and it suddenly occured to me what difference did it make what i wore at bucks funeral
beth retreats inside the house to the kitchen
just hear me out beth
it wont hurt you to listen
i wont listen to that
no one in their right mind would listen to that
i just want to talk about something i always remembered
why do you want to remind me of it
because ive always wondered in some needling way what it mattered what i wore
i was crazy that day
we were going to our sons funeral
and you were worried about what i wore on my feet
im sure it sounds like nothing to you but it sticks with me and i just wanted to
tell you about it
she comes to him and takes him into her arms
its all right
two stairways one going down one up cross each other in the middle space of the mall
on the one going down is beth caroll beths friend is on the other
they have to shout
how are you
how are you
i havent seen you
im so busy
i promise ill call you soon and well have lunch
give him my love
is everything okay
beth gestures to the crowd in the mall
isnt this madness
it gets worse every year
beth is spacing seemingly gazing at a dress
may i show you this in your size
may i show you this dress in your size
beth and conrad are having lunch at a table in the diner
beth is summing up the birthday presents she bought
weve got bennetts and grants and foleys
ha conrad should get something for my mother and father
hes not supposed to get something for his doctor is he
i dont think so
i think we should go see him beth
i think we could all go and see him together
he thinks its a good idea
he thinks its a good idea
what does he know about me about this family
ive never even met him
thats the point
wouldnt it be easier if we all talked about it
in the open
what are we gonna talk about
dont try to change me calvin
i dont want anymore changes in my life
for gods sake hasnt enough happened
lets just hold on to what weve got
darling that is what this is for
maybe youll get a surprise
i dont want any surprises
i know im not perfect
and if i cant go around hugging everybody all the time the way you do then im sorry
i am not asking you to be perfect youre missing the point
i dont want to see any doctors or counselors
i am me
this is my family
and if we have problems then we will solve those problems in the privacy of our own home not by running to some kind of specialist everytime something goes wrong
interrupting are you folks ready to order
could you give me a couple of minutes please
running to experts every time something goes wrong
silence beth contd i know you mean well
i want this to be a nice christmas
i do too
i want all of them to be nice christmases we need time together calvin
you and i

calvin seems doubtfull
beth goes softly
beth contd i have already talked to mother about it and conrad can stay with them
please dont worry about it
please for his sake dont indulge him
we need time together
beth takes his hand but it seems almost like a handshake
i love you
i love you too
beth stares at him
lets just give things time
calvin doesnt say anything
conrad came to pick her up they both come out
conrad fetches his car keys while she closes her door
i dont bowl

jeannine enters frame looking very focused ball in hand
she shoots but the ball drops and goes into the gutter to the end
conrad does not react
the skittles are intact
jeannine is eating a hamburger

jeannine giggles with laughing eyes
conrad contd anyway

and youre the hole and youre trapped and its all over
something like that
and its not really scary except it is when you think back on it
cause you know what you were feeling stange and new
a group of noisy students enter the diner
singing and horsing around
students contd like mcdonalds can nobody can do it

so get up and get away
the manager tries to calm them down
a student comes to conrads table and steals some fries

some students grab jeannine and dance around put a mac donalds hat on her head
what are you doing
the manager pushes them towards the exit
hey whats your problem

jeannine laughs a bit stupidly
conrad notices it
she sees that
conrad drives sadly
he is disappointed and acts as if he was sulking
jeannine tries to make it up
not believing yeah they were pretty funny

the result of opposites will overturn the small boat

dr berger comes out of the lift and finds conrad waiting in the dark corridor in a state of emotional shock

lets talk about whats really bothering you
lets talk about whats bothering you
cos thats what you want isnt it
jesus what have i done to make you so angry with me

you blame me for the whole thing
cant you see anything except in terms of how it affects you
and neither can you and neither can anybody else
only maybe im just a little more honest about it
well stop being so godamn honest and start being a little generous
and start thinking about him for a while
i dont know what he expects from me
i never have known
well ill tell you what he expects
he wants me to throw my arms around him everytime he passes an exam
well i cant do it
i cannot respond when someone says here i just did this great thing
all he wants
all he wants is to know you dont hate him
how could i hate him
mothers dont hate their sons
is that what he told you
do you see how you accept what he says with no questions and you cant do the same thing to me can you
i just try to keep this family together
she shouts i dont know what everyone wants from me anymore
beth nobody wants anything from you

ward and his wife just stand there
beth stares away from calvin as in a void
she sighs closes her eyes calvin turns away from the window looks at beth and remembers
when they were happily dancing
to and fro twice calvin in his plane seat reflects
beth checks a pile of mail
conrad comes in
i think im gonna turn in
dinner was good
its pretty early
it was kind of a rough week
i hope your grandmother wasnt too tough on you
she was fine
im glad youre back
conrad gives his mother a hug but she is like made of stone
calvin sees it
conrad contd good night
beth remains transfixed as if she didnt know what it was all about
calvin sees it
beth is not sleeping she looks up sees her husband wrinkled pillow but he is not in bed
she looks at the time gets up puts on a robe
beth goes downstairs tying up her robe
she stops hearing someone sobbing in the dark in the dining room
beth enters the dining room in the dark
calvin is sitting at table in the dark sobbing his head in his hands
beth contd why are you crying
calvin doesnt answer
beth contd can i uh
can i get you something
calvin mutters in a very low voice
what did you say
calvin sits back in his chair
beth contd calvin
what did you say
calvin produces a very deep sigh
beth contd tell me
calvin looks up at her with a sad expression
you are beautiful
and you are unpredictable
but youre so cautious
youre determined beth
but you know something
youre not strong
and i dont know if youre really giving
beth is looking at him not knowing what this is about
calvin contd tell me something
do you love me
do you really love me
i feel the way ive always felt about you
calvin is disappointed by the answer but not surprised just sad
we wouldve been all right if there hadnt been any
but you cant handle mess
you need everything neat and easy
i dont know
maybe you cant love anybody
it was so much buck
and buck died it was as if you buried all your love with him and i dont understand that
i just dont know
calvin contd maybe it wasnt even buck
maybe it was just you
maybe finally it was the best of you that you buried
calvin contd but whatever it was i dont know who you are
i dont know what weve been playing at
so i was crying
calvin is overcome by sadness calvin contd t know if i love you anymore
and i dont know what i am going to do without that
beth does not know what to say or do
she turns away and goes upstairs
beth enters kind of reflects then goes open a closet takes out some luggage
a sudden burst of emotion overcomes her she cries but does not seem to identify the emotion then restrains it
in his bed conrad is not sleeping
he hears the door of the house close then someone walking outside on the gravel
he gets up go look out of the window
ouside a taxi leaves
he goes downstairs
conrad goes downstairs curious
looks around sees nobody
from inside conrad finally sees his father in the garden reflecting
patches of snow
conrad puts on his coat over his pyjamas and joins him
the yard looks smaller without leaves
your mothers going away for a while
back to houston
i dont know
i know why
yeah it is
its my fault
dont do that
dont do that to yourself
its nobodys fault
things happen in this world people dont always have answers for them you know
calvin sits down
calvin contd i dont know why im yelling at you for

the way you used to for him

i never worried about you
i just wasnt listening
well i wasnt putting out many signals then
i dont think you could have done anything
no no no i should
i shouldve got a handle on it somehow
you know i used to figure you had a handle for everything
you knew it all
calvin looks at him and laughs briefly at himself
conrad contd i know that wasnt fair but you always made us feel like everything was gonna be all right
i thought about that a lot lately
i really admire you for it
calvin is moved
well dont admire people too much
theyll disappoint you sometimes
im not disappointed

calvin looks at him cries and takes him in his arms
