malcom x fourth draft screenplay by james baldwin arnold perl and spike lee based on the autobiography of malcolm x as told to alex haley it is a bright sunny
day on a crowded street on the black side of boston
people and kids are busy with their own things
shorty bops his way down the street
he is a runty very dark young man of with a mission and a smile on his face
he wears the flamboyant style of the time the whole zoot suit pegged legs and a wide brim hat with a white feather stuck in the hat band
shorty dodges through the crowd with his packages
his smile is one of anticipation
he nods to a pal without stopping eyes a couple of chicks dancing on the street but is not dissuaded
shorty has his jacket and hat off his sleeves rolled up
he is like a surgeon preparing for an operation
his equipment is spread out on a table can of lye large mason jar wooden stirring spoon knife the eggs
his actions have the character of a ritual each thing being done just so in time honored fashion
he slices the potatoes and drops the thin slices into the mason jar
he adds water and makes a paste of the starch
behind shorty is a spirited barbershop conversation
one man is getting a haircut two others are watching toomer jason one of them from behind a newspaper
a middle aged barber cholly is doing most of the talking
after i hit the number that woman wasnt no good to me at all
the men laugh
angle shorty pries open the can of lye whiffs it
its good and strong
he pours some in the mason jar stirring with the wooden spoon
he cracks the eggs into the mixture and stirs
he waits as fumes rise and feels the outside of the jar as it gets hot
another angle the barbershop seen from a door slightly ajar
a woolly head entirely in shadow peers out
she says im cheap cuz i wont cop her a diamond ring
had the indignation to call me a cheap black sunovabitch to boot
and when a black woman call you a cheap black sunovabitch youve been called a cheap black sunovabitch
cholly is annoyed
its his story
will you let me tell it
on shorty he opens the bulky package he has been carrying unfolds a large rubber apron and gets into it
now he dons a pair of rubber gloves
he is all ready one of his hands is filled with a huge glob of vaseline
his manner is indignant as if he were asking the whereabouts of an exasperating child
reds in the head man
you mean hiding in the head
your mans here and waiting on you
his hands full cholly opens the door with his feet and malcolm comes out a big gawky bright faced country boy wearing downhome clothes and an expression of apprehension
gonna get that first conk laid on hunh homeboy
man dont scare him more than hes scared already
aint too bad
malcolm allows himself to be led to an empty chair where cholly drapes him with a double sheet tucking it tightly around his neck and adding a protective collar of
like anything else
first time a chick gets her cherry popped she might put up a little fight
but pretty soon you cant give her enough
malcolm gulps his eyes on the fuming mason jar
shorty starts massaging a great quantity of vaseline into malcolms scalp covering his neck and ears as well
all the men have gathered around involved in the ritual
for malcolm it is closer to being a kind of execution
git his forehead and eyebrows
i know what im doing
shorty applies the vaseline to that area
now he brings over the steaming jar and places it nearby
shorty contd listen
you pull my coat if its still stinging when i get through cause this shit can burn a hole through cement
hold tight baby and keep your eyes shut
malcolm nods his head clenches his eyes and grits his teeth
shorty applies the congolene with a comb working it into malcolms hair
i thought you said it was gonna sting
this aint nothin
for a moment nothing happens then the heat hits him
he yells tries to catch his breath his head is on fire
malcolm contd you motherfucker
youre killing me
im burning up
my damn head is on fire
he nearly leaps out of the chair but the barber restrains him
shorty utterly unmoved by the outburst continues working the congolene into his hair
malcolm breaks out of the chair wildly
but the three men drag him to a basin where shorty has attached the shower spray
his cries filling the room malcolm is ducked under the spray
shorty starts rinsing out his hair
dont fight me man
let me git it out
malcolm is a little relieved he tentatively opens his eyes then he feels the congolene again and there is another outburst
shorty forces his head under the spray spurts the water all over his head wetting malcolm and the shop in the process
well homeboy you almost there
shorty is supervising as malcolm tries on a zoot suit
he slips into the jacket
shoes off malcolm steps into the tight fltting peg legged pants
dons a wide brimmed hat with a bright blue feather
finally fully outfitted he leans forward toward his new image in the full length mirror twirling a long dangling key chain
well all right then
well all reet then
the transformation is complete
the two laugh and slap hands
malcolm and shorty come strutting down the street two conked zoot suited sharpies
hometown boy has departed
and the chicks on the street notice them especially malcolm the taller of the two the lighter skinned the more dominant
they walk imperiously past fully aware of their impact
he becomes a still
when my mother was pregnant with me she told me later a party of klansmen on horseback surrounded our house in omaha
klan on horses in front of house
voice of malcolm x contd they brandished guns and shouted for my father to come out
my mother went to the door where they could see her pregnant condition
a pregnant louise little on porch
voice of malcolm x contd and told them my father was in milwaukee preaching
the klan breaks all the windows in the house then rides off into the glorious d
griffith birth of a nation moonlit night
voice of malcolm x contd the hooded klansman said the good white christians would not stand for his troublemaking and to get out of town
the terrified little children look out a broken window at their mother
voice of malcolm x contd they broke every window with their rifle butts before riding off into the night their torches flaming
voice of malcolm x contd my father was not a frightened negro as most were then and as many still are today
he was six feet four and very black
he looks directly into the camera wearing a baptist ministers robe
voice of malcolm x contd and had a glass eye
he believed as did marcus garvey that freedom independence and self respect could never be achieved by the negro in america
he wears a garvey hat ornate with gold braid
voice of malcolm x contd that therefore black men should leave america and return to the land of their origin
earl little in a wagon with little malcolm
voice of malcolm x contd my father dedicated his life to his beliefs because he had seen four of his six brothers die violently
e wider angle
we see earl in front of a podium in church
he is preaching
voice of malcolm x contd three killed by white men and one lynched
there are nine children in our family
the nine little children
she is a pretty mature woman and white looking
voice of malcolm x contd my mother was an attractive woman an educated woman a strong woman
a posed wedding picture serious but sweet
voice of malcolm x contd she was very light her mama was raped by a white man
one of the reasons she married my father was because he was so black she disliked her complexion and wanted her children to have some color
flash bulb of camera flashes
they both were posed for a picture
the music flying home is blaring as lionel hampton and his band is killing
the music is wild the dancing is frantic the clothes are out and the crowd is predominately black although there is a peppering of whites especially white chicks
and malcolm is a little bug eyed as he nudges shorty watching mixed couples on the floor
a boy in extreme zoot suit flips him a white girl in long blond hair wigs him
malcolm is a little open mouthed
people start moving off the floor making room for the dancers
the music begins to get faster and more furious
it is a fast lindy
people start clapping to the beat as they form a u around the dancers with the band at the open end
two couples are on the floor dancing wildly
they are quickly joined by a half dozen others
these are the best dancers and constitute the main event of a saturday night black dance
people crowd and push to get better vantage points and the competition is under way
it is dominantly black but there are some whites in the audience mostly women
one is sophia a spectacular blonde with a degree of refinement something of a thrill seeker
many of the men try to catch her eye but for the moment sophia is just watching looking for no one in particular but nonetheless looking
getting ready to enter the fray the girl takes off her shoes and bounces out on the floor barefoot with her partner
their advent is greeted with cheers and ad libs
clearly the crowd has its favorites
the music gets faster and the dancing takes on a more frantic and more remarkable quality
he is looking for his partner the girl he brought and now he sees her
he makes his way through the watching audience
she is a fine chick cool and beautiful
she smiles as she sees malcolm approaching
laura and malcolm stand together delighted to be with one another starting to move to the music as they watch the dancers
come on baby lets show em how
laura smiles shyly shes willing
malcolm contd you better get out of them shoes girl
laura laughs goes quickly to a bench and changes into a pair of sneakers
because of the competition laura and malcolm begin at high speed
in a moment they are executing the most intricate steps of the flapping eagle and the kangaroo
malcolm starts boosting her over and around his hips then boosting her over his shoulders
laura is the perfect partner
she loves it
so does the crowd who loves new stars
there are ad lib remarks go man go
a big fat hefty black woman takes shorty out to the dance floor and she takes the lead
as they do the lindy she is slinging shorty around like a rag doll
this woman slides him through her legs and shorty has had enough he runs off the dance floor and hides
laura and malcolm are in the phrase cooking on all burners now and when they execute an especially intricate step even hamp waves over
malcolm is sweating and flushed and enormously elated
he sees that people are watching him goading him on
he notices that sophia in particular has not taken her eyes off him she is clapping in time to his steps
seeing new stars in the making the other dancers move to the side of the floor marking time yielding the dance floor to them
laura and malcolm go into a solo
the crowd loves it
malcolm and sophia are very aware of each other
the finale is the classic drag with laura hanging limp around malcolms neck as he capers off the dance floor to the spontaneous applause of the audience
clapping enthusiastically in open admiration
waiting to catch them as they come off
shorty is whistling and shaking his hand appreciatively
he is also looking out for his dance partner
hey man gimme some skin
shorty this is laura
laura is flushed and out of breath and joyous
ive got to freshen up
now you come back
laura laughs as she goes
she surely will be back
thats a fine chick
fine as may wine
except she live on the hill and got a grandma
make it too easy and it aint no fun
then his vision catches sophia who is approaching him
she makes a simple direct gesture want to dance
malcolm eyes shorty and wordlessly glides into sophias arms
immediately from the glances of the other men at the dance he is the cynosure of all eyes
he has new status
its a heady feeling because she is the first white girl he has ever been with socially who is not an obvious whore
he begins to show off a little cuts a few fine steps
they are dancing closer than before
sophia begins to rock his black world
trying to play it cool but he is beginning to pant
not from the dancing but from the situation a gorgeous white chick asking for it
why dont you take your little girl home red and come on back
he stops in his tracks
he cant believe it
sophia contd just walk
itll be here when you get back
he can only grin
the porch of a respectable house
malcolm with laura he anxious to get away
i better not come in
i aint stupid
i mean its late baby
i know where youre going
im going to bed
i gotta work tomorrow need my rest
laura walks to the door
malcolm contd baby ill call you tomorrow
i aint white and i dont put out
the front door opens its lauras grandmother mrs
he runs down the porch steps
the lone light emits from the car radio which plays the inkspots if i sophia pulls her tight sweater over her head to expose two full ripe white breasts
malcolms eyes are popping out of his head
note its very unusual for women not to wear a bra back in that day but you might say sophia was way ahead of her time
malcolm look at them
have you ever seen white breasts like these
he shakes his head
sophia contd put your black hands on them
he is paralyzed
sophia contd please do as i say
malcolm mumbles something
he then kisses sophia as if his black life depended on it and he commences to kill it
sophia contd hey baby
she stops him for a moment but he buries his head in her long neck
sophia contd am i the first white woman youve been with
she already knows the answer
sheeet you aint
i had aplenty
that isnt a whore
knowing shes right sophia becomes the aggressor
a beat both panting then malcolm stops abruptly
he raises his hand to his face then to sophias hand which is still caressing him
baby take your time
sophias not going anywhere
i told you to walk dont run
i dont like women that talk
she shrugs then moves to embrace him
who wants to talk
the couple starts at it again
on the screen bogart and cagney are blasting away the dirty flat footed coppers with machine guns
its one of those great warner brothers gangster b movies maybe the roaring twenties
malcolm and shorty sit transfixed in their seats
dont you know you cant hump the bogart
eat lead coppers
a bright sunny day long shadows in the park
the commons is almost empty
two improbable zoot suited blacks race past trees and run over the grass
malcolm and shorty are playing cops and robbers while passersby stare
naw you missed me copper
try this on for size
malcolm fires an imaginary tommy machine gun at shorty
i forgot to tell you im wearing a bulletproof vest
the hell you are
im tired of always playing the cops
i wanna be bogart sometimes
youre too small to be bogart
im not too short to be cagney
shorty shoots malcolm from behind
shorty contd pow
malcolm acts as if hes been hit
you got me you dirty filthy rotten stinking copper only a low down yellow rat bastard would shoot a man in the back
malcolm starts to stagger this is a long drawn out hollywood drawn out death a la cagney death in public enemy
malcolm falls directly into the camera face first and shorty stands over him
he use to be a big shot
earl littles face is in the same exact position as malcolms from the previous scene
his mouth opens in terror as the moving trolley comes closer and closer to the black man lying on the tracks
a room clinically empty table chair and mr
he is putting papers into his briefcase the hearing is concluded
what you mean took his own life
im sorry maam
you heard the verdict
a man bash in the back of his head with a hammer lay down on the tracks and kill himself
we merely act on the verdict
we dont make them
he is nearly out the door

it clearly states
malcolm lies in bed naked under the sheet
a half empty whiskey bottle and an ashtray full of butts are on the night table last nights partying

she shrugs shuts off the burner smiles and ambles toward him

she starts to sit down on the bed next to him
malcolm contd sit over there
he points to a nearby chair
sophia makes an amiable hand shrug and complacently goes

he goes right on malcolm contd you one of them white bitches cant get enough black dick

she aims to please
malcolm smacks the bed next to him
she gets up and comes over
malcolm contd take it off
she takes off the apron
malcolm contd now kiss my feet
as sophia bends to do so
sophia now has the scrambled eggs on a plate at malcolms side
she spoons some into his mouth
he chews and swallows slowly then grabs her head and brings it to his
a long brutal kiss
then he pulls her head away by the hair
she looks at him anything he wants
yeah girl thats your story

malcolm lays back on the pillow and she holds out the eggs to him

malcolm and laura are on a deserted cape beach
they are dressed but have their shoes and socks off and he has his trousers rolled up
they walk like birds avoiding getting their feet wet as the waves roll in
malcolm you can be anything you want
you got class and youre smart
all them books you read and you still dont know nuthin
i do know i love you
laura stops him and moves to him
her kiss is a tender one exploratory
then malcolm responds embracing her fully
her arms go around him as they both drop into the sand

malcolm turns his head from her he gets up

louises hand reaches for a small sack of flour stamped not for sale
she brings it down on the table with a hard controlled whap
i did knock
louise doesnt look up

widen to show louise with a white social worker miss dunne complete with pad pencil and goodwill
huddled out of sight but nonetheless visible are five small black children

louise is very aware of the children and struggling for self possession
as you nice enough to ask well git you one
one of the children brings over a chair
miss dunne sets out her papers
its the same questions mrs

there is a serious question as to whether these are my children

angle louise starts to sing a negro spiritual
he has been standing there in deep pain all along
the crack train of the new york new haven hartford speeds through the new england countryside
three elderly black waiters and malcolm wearing a sandwichmans uniform are crowded around a portable radio in the galley where food is prepared

malcolms mood is exuberant the fight is still in his ears

a insert fantasy projection
malcolm picks up a slab of cream pie and pushes it in blades face
normality again malcolm finishes serving him with complete servility
he pulls out a bill
keep the change
and takes a satisfying bite out of his thin sandwich
as the clipper surfaces in harlem pulls up to the th street station
malcolm out of uniform and dressed in his zoot suit comes down from the park avenue station in harlem
he is hit with the sights and sounds
everything delights him the noise the lights the women the pimps the signs the windows the crowds the laughter the music
a crowd of people run by malcolm yelling and screaming
the brown bomber the brown bomber joe louis the heavyweight champion of the world

the citizens of harlem are hugging kissing drinking dancing folks are hanging from street lamps yelling out their windows holding up hand made joe louis banners everyone has great reason
to be joyous

malcolm quickly looks at his watch hes running late for his train as he fights his way through the crowd like a salmon going upstream the camera cranes up to
see him eventually get lost in a sea of black humanity cutting loose
malcolm newly conked and sharp as a tack zoot suit trouser crease like a knifes edge orange knob toed shoes walks toward his goal smalls paradise
the street is crowded with people kids and hustlers

before entering malcolm sharps himself a bit picking off some lint cocking his hat
the restaurant is crowded both at the bar and at the tables beyond
the immediate impression is of subdued well being of decorum of easy affluence
this is the world malcolm wants into
he digs it drinking in its details
a big man fox accidentally bumps into malcolm almost knocking over
the word is excuse me
look country boy you shouldnt have been in my way
everyone becomes quiet in the bar
fox contd so what are you gonna do

malcolm grabs a bottle off the bar counter and with lightning speed brings it crashing down on foxs head
as he lays on the floor with head bleeding malcolm kicks him in the stomach two times
its done the fight is over and people pull him off of fox

malcolm is looking at himself in a mirror in archies room
he has on the full outfit now together with a new white on white shirt and a sulka tie

malcolm buttons the jacket and turns around demonstrating for archies inspection
archie contd you looking good little

archie has walked over to him

malcolm frisks him carefully pats his sides his pockets under his arms his legs
archie is clean to the touch
archie contd triumphantly and im still carrying

then reaching under his coat he takes a revolver out from the middle of his back
and hands it to malcolm
holding the deadly instrument fascinated by it hefting it feeling its power

malcolm slips it carefully into the small of his back behind his trouser belt
his first gun the feeling shines in his eyes bogart has become a black man

malcolm scribbles the number onto a piece of paper
ringing up an amount
malcolms hand writes out the number

archie with malcolm as the latter writes down

we are tight on malcolms intense face he is pulling on a fat joint
we hear bogart blasting his way out of a police blockade
a phone rings
there is music playing
wordlessly archie sprinkles a few grains of fine crystal onto a round shaving mirror
he slides it across a table to malcolm and hands him a short straw
sophia sits next to malcolm she and archie are already high
malcolm leans over the mirror placing the straw in his nostril
in the mirror something satanic about him as he sniffs the cocaine well into his nose
a beat as he leans back waiting for the drug to take hold malcolm looks into dressing mirror
malcolm with gun in hand does his bogart gangster imitation
aint nuthin in the world to give you that real deep cool

she continues to laugh

malcolm slides his tongue down sophias throat
a miserable night raining and cold
malcolm turns into the bar
shaking off the rain as malcolm walks through
he is now a familiar figure to the bars denizens
he is met with ad lib cries hey little have a taste from the men and from the women come here sugar where you been
malcolm acknowledges the greetings strolls down in the bar
its immediately clear that a subtle change has come over him
he is no longer the neophyte but a well groomed smooth fully polished hustler
malcolm sits into the booth and motions for the waitress
a fine copper tan waitress comes to him
i thought you said we were going to the movies last night
i say a lot of things
and like a fool i believe it
do your job get me a bourbon on the rocks and a pack of luckys
honey stares at him
malcolm contd i said now
he leans his head back against the booth daniel come in yet honey
malcolm turns his head sharply at the sound of the voice
its familiar a sound from the seemingly distant past
he looks toward the bar and sees the women who asked the question
its laura but not the laura we last saw
she is still young still vulnerable but she is bolder more self assured more vividly dressed
she is unaware of malcolm
aint that him now
angle favoring daniel
he is a young cocky nervous gingerbread colored boy who comes over to her quickly
he goes to the corner of the bar and quickly grabs lauras neck and kisses her hungrily
hey gorgeous how you been
lemme see you
its obvious hes a junkie
and in need of a fix
honey places his drink and cigarettes before him
hes watching taking it all in immediately
laura is clearly crazy about daniel
he looks then belts down his drink
daniel motions to her pocketbook and she takes out a five dollar bill
he grabs it and bolts for the door
she has been watching malcolm
you know that gal
mind your own goddamn business
she comes in a lot
bout every other night red
malcolm contd she know
if she got eyes she do
walking toward the door looking for daniel
she leaves the bar
is she hooking
but the way things going that boy gonna turn her out any day
malcolm smacks the table in frustration
honey contd you stuck on her
malcolms glass on the table is trembling
shut up bitch
he raises his arm to hit her and it is held back before it can find its mark
dont do that
archie is standing above him
malcolm nods and archie lets his arm go standing next to him is sophia
archie contd honey he didnt mean it
archie wiggles his fingers and honey goes but not before throwing daggers at malcolm and sophia
archie sits down takes out a cigar
for a good beat there is a coolness between them
then malcolm reaches over and lights archies cigar
sophia stares at her man he then motions for her to sit down beside him
archie contd thanks

the father son thing is back but malcolm will never again be the student

archie is controlling himself
everyone in smalls is all ears a falling out between malcolm and archie their reps are at stake
archie looks at sammy
sammy is neutral
archie digs in his pockets comes up with a roll
he peels off six bills and throws them on the table in front of himself as he gets up
oh sit down man

malcolm contd come on sweetlips i got us some g i r l girl

the well known nd street nightspot features billie holiday
a stand up cutout of her is outside
this is a plush nightclub with a mixed black and white audience
some of the hustlers from smalls are in evidence
lady day starts into you dont know what love is
malcolm and sophia high as a kite and on the town
he makes his way toward malcolms table
there is murder in his eyes

archie contd you took me you bastard and now im taking you

malcolm looks sammy at the nearby bar his hand in his coat pocket
his hand is also in his pocket
and every cats watching aint they
its a toe down
thats what it is
walk on out

archie backs away from the table his gun on malcolm
as sammy moves a step toward malcolm malcolm rises in his seat
you had the number
baby i got to let this old man win
keep the faith and tell billie ill see her later
she knows whats going on
angle sammy and archie are walking behind malcolm when he pushes a waitress into their path with drinks flying everywhere malcolm darts away
he races into the mens room
archie and sammy run after him
there is an open window
archie is leaning out looking both ways
a tiny alleyway
no one is visible
the dirty yellow rat bastard
dont push it
you way ahead
you back on top
that boy loves you man
what you say
he gave it to you archie
malcolm comes running out of an alleyway and onto the street
he stops to catch his breath to regain his composure
he is shook up frustrated but mostly saddened
he then runs down the block and into a earl is sitting up in bed he wakes his sleeping wife louise next to her is a baby in a crib
malcolm sleeps between earl and her
outside the house are members of the black legion
they are dressed in the style of the kkk but in black sheets rather than white
we see gasoline cans being passed around
somebody out there
wake the children
earl starts to put on his overalls and reaches for his gun which sits on a nearby chair when an explosion of flames greets the house
earl contd everybody out
get the kids
flames roar through the room and the little kids are hysterical
louise rushes in and pushes them past the fire she has infant in hand covered in a blanket
the entire house is in flames
the little family stands in front of it just out of harms way
they sit on their horses watching the results of their work
boy good thing were good christians
nigger its time for you to leave this town
this here is pose to be a free country
rev we warned you bout that garvey preaching stirring up the good nigras here
boy next time youre a dead nigger
i aint a boy
im a man and a real man dont hide behind no bedsheets
earl takes his pistol out from behind his back and fires above their heads
earl contd take these here bullets for dem sheets
the bullets send the black legion flying into the glorious d
griffith moonlit night
the burning house collapses behind the little family
earl i know you a better shot than that
you shoulda killed em all shot em dead
just wanted to scare em they wont be bothering us no more
young malcolm stares at his father while the house still burns behind him no doubt drawing on the great courage displayed by his father
they wont be here no time soon
im a man
its raining cats and dogs and its foggy
we hear a big thud then a grunt and earl little falls across the trolley tracks the sound of men running away is heard in the distance
he has been beaten to a bloody pulp
he opens his one good eye
he sees something ahead in the fog and rain
winces and then makes the sign of the cross
jumping out of the streetcar to attend to earl
somebody get a doctor
no doctor get him a priest
my fathers skull on one side was crushed in and then laid across some tracks for a streetcar to run him over
his body was cut almost in half
my father earl little lived two and a half hours in that condition
negroes were stronger than they are now
shorty is driving with sophia in the front seat
malcolm is in the back
they are in the country outside new york
man im glad we got you out of there
with west indian archie on your ass your name on the wire boston the best goddam place in the world for you things are too hot and its not even
malcolm has withdrawn within himself
he takes out a packet of cocaine and sniffs it
well take it easy
i got a place fixed up on harvard square
hows that sound
cool it and lay dead for a while homeboy
and dont worry none
the drug takes hold
malcolm is out of it
shorty contd ill stake you baby

im blowing great sax
hell you aint even heard us he and sophia keep talking it up trying to bolster malcolm
stoned his nose running malcolm stares out of the window at the receding landscape
like every hustler i was trapped
cats that hung together trying to find a little security to find an answer found nothing
cats that might have probed space or cured cancer hell archie might have been a mathematical genius all victims of whiteys social order
music of a dance combo heard in bg
voice of malcolm x contd three things i was always scared of a job a bust and jail
i realized then i wasnt afraid of anything

shorty reaches into his pocket

he takes out his gun a

malcolm contd palmed it right in the goddam chamber

malcolm starts laughing a silent hysterical laugh
the robbery in quick cuts a door lock is picked by sophia
a pencil flashlight passes an upstairs window
b rudy in the car
c silver removed from a drawer by shorty
d peg walking down the street as lookout
e malcolm takes off his shoes
f the sleeping old man old talcum powder as malcolm takes a watch a wallet from within inches of his pillow
then more boldly picks up the mans hand and removes a ring from one of his fingers
shorty watching with bated breath hes about to have a heart attack
a boston matron mrs
crawford is showing the girls her collection of u
in a fine new england home
beacon hill survey
were doing a survey for the athenaeum society we wondered if youd permit us to include your collection in the catalog of great new england antiques
now these are my prizes
my paul revere silver coffee service
lovely just lovely
sophia is casing the room carefully as the matron continues
and my husbands collection of scrimshaw should be included
may we see it
wont you step this way
the prisoners face the bench peg sophia shorty rudy and malcolm
the average first offender gets two years for burglary
we were all first offenders
thats what sophia and peg drew two years in the womens reformatory at framingham
but our crime wasnt burglary
it was balling white girls
they gave us the book
burglary count one to years count two to years count three to years
he continues giving them to years behind malcolms comment fourteen counts of to years
the sentences to run concurrently
shorty thought he hit us with years till i explained what concurrently meant
it meant a minimum sentence of years hard labor at the charlestown state prison
the date was february
i wasnt quite
i had not yet begun to shave
camera has gone in for a tight close shot of malcolms face a hardened hustler pimp dope peddler and now jailbird at the ripe old age of
it is the afternoon lockup about p
the line of prisoners stands in front of their cells as two guards wilkins and barnes one white one black slowly walk past the p
the procedure is routine done without emotion as it is done three times a day the black guard calls out the prisoners name the prisoner answers with his number then
steps into his cell
whereupon the white guard slams the door shut and locks it
door is slammed and gate locked
each time a gate is locked his tension increases
his face is a mask hiding his fury violence and the hunger of an advanced junkie who has not had a fix in over a week
shooting past malcolm favoring two other prisoners
the guards are approaching malcolms cell
past malcolm are two experienced prisoners who have been watching malcolm during the scene
they whisper surreptitiously without moving their bodies and barely moving their lips
one of the prisoners is pete a huge barrel of a man a lifer beaten by the system and a lifetime of incarceration
the other is bembry a man of no great physicality but who possesses immediately the gift of leadership
it is clear that pete and others look up to him with great respect
i see him
bembrys language is very unhip
he speaks carefully
he respects words and he respects himself something which sets him apart from all the other prisoners
he bout to bust
no hes not gonna bust
but hes not gonna fix his face to please them neither
the check in has reached the man next to malcolm
door slammed and locked
the guards are now in front of him
malcolm doesnt move
state your number
malcolm doesnt answer doesnt blink
bembry in the fg of the scene
hes a new fish mr
give him a break
its a bold step by bembry and the prisoners look over at him with admiration
barnes accepts the irregularity and calls over to bembry
kay ill give him a break
now state your number little
i forgot it
shaking his head in anguish
he knows whats coming
barnes makes a small gesture and wilkins seizes malcolm grabbing his head and uniform at the same time
stenciled on the chest of his faded dungarees is malcolms number
the guard bends malcolms head to the number shoving the material in malcolms face
can you read boy
thass your number
now say it
im malcolm little not no goddam number
oh yes you is baby thass all you is
and slams malcolm hard
he slumps to the floor
two days in the hole
wilkins drags malcolm off as barnes resumes the roll call
guard barnes contd burnham
only the faintest light comes into the hideous room which consists of a mattress and a slop bucket
if malcolm were to stretch out his arms he could touch both walls
he lies half on the stone floor half on the mattress
a clang as the heavy door is opened
get on your feet
guard cone contd little state your number
a beat as malcolm stares at the man refusing to answer
guard cone contd you just drew two more days
and slams the door shut
it is almost pitch black
we can almost smell the stench of the room
malcolm sits stony faced his back against a wall
the long spigot of a watering can is pushed through an opening in the cell door
malcolm animal like leaps at it and bends the spout wrenching it off in his fury
do you know what a friend you have in jesus son
preacher take your tin jesus and the virgin mary both and shove em
malcolm is alone at the bars the hope of freedom filling his mind
malcolm pulls at the bars tries to shake them in impotent fury
he pounds the walls
empty sick defeated his nails scratching the walls he slides to the floor of the cell
it is the low point of his life nowhere to turn nothing to hope for
guard cone is shaking him into consciousness
all right little
malcolm just about makes it
the guard is in half focus
guard cone contd state your number
he is beaten
a shower is heard
malcolm stands with bowed head as the hot water cascades over his broken body
he lets it run and run but it cannot really touch his problems
on a nearby bench are his clothes his towel and the makings for a conk lye vaseline comb etc
he turns for a moment as he sees he is being watched by someone
its bembry standing nearby
malcolm turns away trying to find solace in the water
he wants no part of the world or anyone just to be left alone
i know how you feel
like you want to lay down and die
malcolm shows no flicker of interest or understanding
bembry contd i brought you something
he puts down a small matchbox on the bench next to malcolms things
malcolm eyes him like a snake but the punishment has reduced him to deep insecurity and his belligerence is more cautious than angry
who the hell are you
put it in a cup of water
man what do you want
you need something
its not a reefer but itll help some
man get outa my face
i aint nobodys punk
but he steps out of the shower fills a tin cup with water and empties the contents of the matchbox into it
and drinks it down quickly
sit down or it might knock you down
malcolm sits toweling himself as the spice hits him
for the first he smiles this is the first relief he has tasted in prison
he at bembry wonderingly unable to figure him out
if you aint trying to punk me whats your hype
i can show you how to get out of prison
and its no hype
talk daddy im listening
hey that aint bad
you got some more
thats the last stuff youll ever get from me
what did you give it to me for then
cause you needed it
cause you couldnt hear me without it
this is a new breed of cat malcolm has never met anyone like him
he eyes him closely as he slips into his clothes
what in the hell are you talking about
he begins to conk his hair but is paying attention to what bembry is saying
i think you got more sense than any cat in this prison
how come you are such a fool
malcolm looks over piqued
bembry contd nobody can bust out like bogart does it in the movies
because even if you get out you are still in prison
malcolm is putting the conk into his hair now
you aint lying
when you go busting your fists against a stone wall youre not using your brains
cause thats what the white man wants you to do
look at you
these last words are spoken sharply with disgust
malcolm turns his hands massaging the conk into his hair
bembry contd putting all that poison in your hair
man you been locked up too long everybody conks
all the cats
why does everybody conk
cause i dont want to walk around with my head all nappy looking like like what
looking like me
like a nigger
why dont you want to look like what you are
what makes you ashamed of being black
i aint said im ashamed
he turns the water on to wash out the conk which has begun to burn
bembry restrains him holding his arm
i got to wash it out
let it burn
maybe youll hear me then
but it is burning now
man you better get off me
he wrenches away from bembry and puts his head in the water
sure burn yourself pain yourself put all that poison into your hair into your body trying to be white
man i dont want to hear all that
i thought you was smart
but you just another one of them cats strutting down the avenue in your clown suit with all that mess on you
like a monkey
and the white man sees you and he laughs
he laughs because he knows you aint white
malcolm is drying his hair finishing his conk
but some of what bembry has said disturbs him
who are you
malcolm is completely humiliated
bembry sees this and stops the barrage
the question is who are you
you are in the darkness but its not your fault
elijah muhammad can bring you into the light
elijah muhammad can get you out of prison
out of the prison of your mind
maybe all you want is another fix
i thought you were smart
and he is gone
malcolm stands looking after him a long thoughtful moment
he is pulling the comb through his hair
prisoners are working on a beltline that stamps out and finishes license plates
bembry is on the stamping machines working as he talks to the other prisoners
malcolm is painting the plates a little removed from bembry but listening with interest
barnes with rifle idles by a window
a whistle sounds ending the work shift
the inmates quickly file out into the yard
malcolm is half decided
you taking the yard
barnes gestures to malcolm
what you sniffing around for
i told you i gave you your last fix
i aint never seen a cat like you
aint you scared talking like that in front of an ofay
whats he gonna do to me he aint already done
you the only cat dont come on with that whatcha know daddy jive and you dont cuss none
i respect myself
a man cuss because he hasnt got the words to say whats on his mind
tell you this you aint no fool
dont con me
dont con me
what do you do with your time
because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself
respect his body and his mind
quit taking the white mans poison into your body his cigarettes his dope his liquor his white woman his pork
thats what mama used to say
your mama had sense because the pig is a filthy beast part rat part cat and the rest is dog
malcolm has been pondering all this and now grows animated as he thinks he has come to the essence of a hustle
come on daddy pull my coat
what happens if you give all that up
you get sick or somethin
i pulled a hustle once and got out of the draft
im telling you gods words not no hustle
im talking the words of elijah the black mans god
im telling you boy that god is black
everybody knows god is white
bembry contd but everything the white man taught you you learned
he told you you were a black heathen and you believed him
he told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light
and you believed him
he taught you to worship a blond blue eyed god with white skin and you believed him
he told you black was a curse you believed him
did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary
did you ever study anything wasnt part of some con
what the hell for man
go on fool the marble shooters are waiting for you
show me man
we can read the fine print of the definition black blak adj
destitute of light devoid of color enveloped in darkness
hence utterly dismal or gloomy as the future looked black
you understand them words
pullback to show bembry and malcolm in a small prison library
no one else is in the book lined room
i cant make out that shit
soiled with dirt foul sullen hostile forbidding as a black day
foully or outrageously wicked as black cruelty
indicating disgrace dishonor or culpability
see also blackmail blackball blackguard
hey theys some shit all right
now look up white
bembry turns the pages of the dictionary to w
bembry contd read it
white whit adj
of the color of pure snow reflecting all the rays of the spectrum
the opposite of black hence free from spot or blemish innocent pure without evil intent harmless
honest square dealing honorable
malcolm stumbles through the definition as well as he can
bembry takes over the reading giving it ironic emphasis
thats a white mans book
aint all these white mans books
they sure aint no black mans books in here
then what you telling me to study in them for
you got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him
the truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words
its buried there
you got to dig it out
man howm i gonna know the ones worth looking at
bembry smiles at malcolm
he is a remarkable man who always takes careful measure of his listener
he never talks down to his audience he talks to them
a manner malcolm later will adopt
bembry can talk funky or salty or as we will see in the cadence and eloquence of the bible
right now he goes into street talk
ill pull your coat daddy
cause lots of these cant nobody read be he black or white or a ph
with their suspenders dragging the ground with degrees
he likes and admires the man
then caught by a passage he does not understand man im studying in the mans book
i dont dig half the words
look em up and and out what they mean
where am i gonna start
start at the beginning
page one the first one
here as bembrys hand opens the book to page one
an earth pig an ant eating african mammal
man that sounds like the dozens
read it and keep on reading
malcolms finger runs down to the next definition abacus noun
an ancient and primitive chinese counting device
if you take one step toward allah he will take two steps toward you
he is reading on his bunk as barnes walks by
the lights in the cell go out
malcolm looks up annoyed at being interrupted
he shifts his position to the floor of the cell so that he can catch the dim light coming from the corridor and goes on with his reading
malcolm is studying the dictionary the last of the as the words azimuth azores aztec azure etc
he reads a word then holds his hand over the printed definition to test himself half mouthing its meaning
malcolm is also copying the dictionary in a school book word for word
there are several books on the desk before malcolm
we see their titles w
duboiss the soul of black folks carter g
woodsons journal of negro history durants story of philosophy h
wellss outline of history spinoza thoreau etc
knock it off
malcolm is surprised the time has gone so fast
he gathers up his books with care
he cherishes them putting them back on the shelf carefully
you studying to be the first colored president of the states
the machines are idle no one is in the room but malcolm
he starts to reach inside his jacket when barnes sticks his head in
you taking the yard or not
then give me a butt
malcolm takes out a half filled pack of cigarettes about to offer one then pauses
malcolm hands him the pack of cigarettes
i dont smoke no more
he takes the pack happily and goes
malcolm reaches into his jacket again takes out a book
we see its title mahatma gandhis my struggle
he sits next to the license press to read
a baseball game is in progress
a black team is playing a white one
most of the convicts are watching the game partisanship at every pitch
a base hit gets a big reaction
they are out along the right field wall
they walk throughout the scene
angle the ball is hit over the fence for a home run
there is a big cheer from the black prisoners
pete the batter trots proudly around the bases
ole pete aint much in the head but he can lay in there with the wood
lemme tell you about history black history
two shot malcolm still watching the game
you pitch baby ill ketch
the first men on earth were black
they ruled and there was not one white face anywhere
but they teach us that we lived in caves and swung from trees
black men were never like that
malcolm is listening to bembrys intent statement
bembry contd we were a race of kings when the white men went around on all fours
there is a crack of the bat and malcolm turns to watch another base hit by a black convict stir the crowd
this a helluva game
somethins going on
he sees a black convict chuck nearby and calls over malcolm contd hey whatsa score
to we murdering them dint you hear
the brooklyn dodgers brought up jackie robinson and we pounding the hell out of them celebrating
how bout that
sure white man throw us a bone and thats supposed to make us forget years
a black man playing big league ball is something
i told you to go behind the words and dig out the truth
they let us sing and dance and smile and now they let one black man in the majors
that dont cancel out the greatest crime in history
when that blue eyed devil locked us in chains of us broke up our families tortured us cut us off from our language our religion our history
in the stands cheering and joyous
bembry contd do they know who they are
do you know where you came from
we are the original people
malcolm is listening to him now
bembry contd whats your name boy
malcolm is startled answers like a boy
thats the name of the slave master who owned your family
you dont even know who you are
less than nothing
who are you
wrapped in thought
im not malcolm little and im not satan
who are you
malcolm cannot answer because he truly does not know
a ball is hit
malcolm watches its flight but his face is fixed somewhere between understanding and anger it is the face of the future leader
i told you we are a nation the lost tribe of shabazz in the wilderness of north america
the rays of the sun come through bars that cut across malcolm and bembrys face
allah has sent us a prophet a black man named elijah muhammad
for if god is black malcolm then the devil is white
i knew youd hear me
the white man is the devil
all white men are devils
i sure met some
elijah muhammad does not say that white man is a devil
he teaches us that the white man is the devil
all white men
have you ever known a good white man in all your life
think back did you ever meet one who wasnt evil
a prison whistle is heard
malcolm and bembry standing close together
the feeling is of someone taking communion with bembry the minister and malcolm the communicant
their voices are little more than whispers
the body is a holy repository
i will not touch the white mans poison his drugs his liquor his carrion his women
a muslim must be strikingly upright
so those in the darkness can see the power of the light
malcolm lifts his head
i will do it
but the key to islam is submission
that is why twice daily we turn to mecca to the holy of holies to pray
we bend our knees in submission
bembry kneels in a praying position
for evil to bend its knee admit its guilt implore his forgiveness is the hardest thing on earth i want to bembry but i cant
the hardest and the greatest
for evil to bend its knee admit its guilt implore his forgiveness is the hardest thing on earth i want to bembry but i cant
the hardest and the greatest
i dont know what to say to allah
have you ever bent your knees malcolm
malcolm laugh snorts yeah
when i was picking a lock to rob somebodys house
tell him that
i dont know how
you can grovel and crawl for sin but not to save your soul
pick the lock malcolm pick it
i want to
god knows i want to
malcolm holds a letter in his hand
he reads it carefully
he has read it several times before
i received a letter that day from the honorable elijah muhammad
the messenger of allah wrote me a nobody a junkie a pimp and a convict
i have come to give you something which can never be taken from you i bring you a sense of your own worth the worth of one human being
the knowledge of self
the room becomes transformed
it is suddenly suffused with light
and standing in the cell with malcolm is elijah muhammad
he has materialized but he can be seen through
he is malcolms it was like a blinding light and i became aware that he was in the room with me
he wore a dark suit and on his face i saw a pain so old and deep and black i could scarcely look at him
i knew i was not dreaming
he was there
i tell you that the most dangerous creation of any society in the world is the man with nothing to lose
you do not need ten such men to change the world
one will do
the earth belongs to us the black man and whatever is around it and on it and in it
praises are due to him forever for bringing to us again our self and our property the universe of sun and suddenly as he came he was gone
the hallucination disappears
voice of malcolm x contd and then i could do it
malcolm goes down on his knees
there are tears in his eyes as he begins praying allah akbar all praise to him who is all seeing all understanding
he continues to pray
we are told that saul on the road to damascus heard the words of truth he fell from his horse
i do not liken myself to paul but i understand
it happened to me
a poorly furnished small but immaculate room
there are two couches a table set for eating and on the walls a portrait of elijah and a muslim banner
it is dinner time in a muslim home
sidney aged a perfect specimen of the fruit of islam stands behind his chair waiting
their mother lorraine a woman of bembrys age is seated but she too awaits bembry
in the name of allah the beneficent and the merciful to whom all praise is due
at the window bembry saying the evening prayers
dear brother malcolm i am back in the bosom of islam praise allah
he comes to the table nods and sits
sidney respectfully sits after him
food is passed
it is simple fare natural foods milk greens
the portions are small
they eat in silence but there is warmth and love at this table
bembrys voice contd we dont have much but what we have is yours
lorraine and my two sons join with me in saying that when you come out which will not be too long come straight to us
malcolm is reading bembrys letter as he waits his turn
there is a white convict in the chair just being finished by a white barber simmons
a black barber slim sits by
both are convicts
note malcolm now wears glasses all that reading in his badly lit cell has ruined his eyes
you write thanking me
dont thank me
he did it all
malcolm starts for the chair
simmons moves away to light a cigarette as slim takes over
please thank the honorable elijah muhammad for the money and tell him i have not written him because i have not yet proven myself
archie and cadillac are reading a letter they have received
they look at each other incredulously
but i have written everyone else
shorty is waving a letter he has received to his cellmate
look like homey got himself a brand new hype
an immaculate room well furnished
elijah sits in a chair as bembry stands reading malcolms letter
i wrote the mayor the governor and the president but for some reason i havent heard from them
bembry laughs elijah smiles
tell the messenger of allah that i have dedicated my life to telling the white devil the truth to his face
i greet you with the ancient words as salaam alikum
wa alaikum salaam
i finally worked my way through the zs
a group of prisoners mostly white but with a goodly smattering of black convicts are listening to a lecture by chaplain gill
are there any questions
malcolm seated next to a black convict raises his hand
its the only hand up
the chaplain searches for another questioner but there arent any
pete sitting next to malcolm whispers
watch out baby this cat is heavy on religion
i see this has become a struggle between good and evil
satan has a question
there is laughter from the convicts
yes it is chaplain gill
but i wouldnt want to say which one of us is what
laughter especially from the black convicts
why dont you just ask your question
youve been talking about the disciples
what color were they
i dont think we know for certain
there are reactions from the convicts
malcolm is sharply challenging a white man about color
they were hebrew werent they
as jesus was
jesus was also a hebrew
just what is your question
what color were the original hebrews
i told you we dont know for certain
then we dont know that god was white
there is a strong reaction to this
now just a moment just a moment but we do know that the people of that region of asia minor from the tigris euphrates valley to the mediterranean are dark
ive studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels
i have never seen a native of that area who was not black
just what are you saying
im not saying anything preacher
im proving to you that god is black
note try to get footage from the last temptation of christ willem dafoe god is black
malcolm opens the door the room is dark and he sees a small slight man standing against the window he doesnt move
this is the same man who appeared in malcolms cell this is the honorable elijah muhammad
malcolm slowly moves toward him he is completely humbled in his presence
he turns from the window to malcolm
my son youve been a thief drug dealer and a pimp and the world is still full of temptation
when god bragged how faithful job was the devil argued that only gods protective hedge around him kept him pure the devil said remove the hedge and he will curse
malcolm your hedge has been removed and i believe you will remain faithful
he cannot say anything and he drops his head he is overwhelmed with heartfelt emotion
in contrast to the peaceful family scene the room is a beehive of activity
sidney is turning out leaflets on a mimeograph machine lorraine is busy making up a mailing list using x file cards bembry is recruiting on the telephone
how many you turning out
we got a lot of fishing to do
brother malcolm i want you to meet brother earl
he just joined the nation
earl moves toward malcolm and extends his hands
malcolm shakes it warmly
we can always use another good brother
im a willing servant for allah
sunday service has let out and malcolm earl and sidney are fishing
theyre trying to convert the black christians
malcolm speaks while the others hand out leaflets
you think you are christians and yet you see your so called white christian brother hanging black christians on trees
you say that white man loves you and yet he has done every evil act against you
he has everything while he is living and tells you to be a good slave and when you die you will have more than he has in beulahs land
we so called negroes are in pitiful shape
get off your knees praying to a picture of a white pale blond and blue eyed jesus
come out of the sky
build heaven on earth
islam is the black mans true religion
malcolm is talking to a crowd from a ladder
and that the white man is the devil
yes god is black and you are made in his image and dont know it
thats how brainwashed you are
the crowd is listening caught up in malcolms intensity
malcolm contd my brothers and sisters they tell you you will sprout wings when you die and fly to heaven
the honorable elijah muhammad tells you thats pie in the sky
amid the listeners watching their response
have you ever seen a black man who wasnt down on his knees begging the lord to give him in heaven what the white devil enjoys right here on earth
they turn from malcolm moving a few steps away and now are the audience on an adjacent speaker
he is a young firebrand the harlem council fights for rat control for rent control and for community control of our schools
pan continues to take in another speaker a few feet away
we see the street corner is harlems hyde park with half a dozen speakers haranguing the crowd with half a dozen panaceas
that malcolm is just one among many if the man behind the counter aint black dont go in
boycott the man
come to our temple and hear the truth
because brother and sister you are dead
yes you are mentally dead spiritually dead morally dead
and we are here to resurrect the black man back from the dead
a place where black women come to offer themselves for day work
several are seen
a white women comes up to one to interview her bargain with her
malcolms voice is heard before he is seen speaking to the women from a ladder
my beautiful sister for you are beautiful
beautiful because you are black
because black is beautiful
you work in the white folks kitchen so i dont have to tell you that theyre devils
malcolm contd and you are putting yourselves on the auction block letting them examine you like a horse like a slave
the honorable elijah muhammad teaches that you are black and should be proud
face of one black woman beginning to shake her head in accord
the same woman now at a muslim meeting
the faces of other listeners from the church and from the maids market are scattered in malcolms audience
the headquarters itself shows the progress malcolm has made
it is better furnished larger and the chairs are filled
bembry sidney and lorraine are in the back of the room pleased with the growth
malcolm stands at a podium
were not american were africans who happen to be in america
we were kidnapped and brought here against our will from africa
we didnt land on plymouth rock brothers and sister
plymouth rock landed on us
reactions laughter interest
ad lib thats the truth
put an end to your begging
no more please mr
white man lawdy boss brush me another crumb from off your table kindly sir
we are a nation a great nation and dont need a thing from them
malcolm scanning the faces of his audience as they react
he sees someone he knows and blurts out boyishly and winningly malcolm contd shorty
the crowd turns to shorty sitting embarrassedly in the audience
malcolm contd come on up here man and give us some skin
heres a man brothers and sisters who shot up with me who robbed with me and did time in the white devils jailhouse
stand up shorty and be counted but shorty is trying to hide from the spotlight
malcolm comes down from the platform and walks to him
malcolm contd folks the brother is shy and needs special attention
so would you excuse us while brothers sidney and earl take up the collection
he embraces shorty as the crowd laughs appreciatively and brothers sidney and earl have a chuckle themselves
shortly and malcolm sit at a table
shorty has a cup of coffee in front of him
i got to hand it to you homey
thats the best preacher hype i ever did hear
it isnt a hype shorty
and i meant what i said join us
come on baby

all the vigor is gone all the life has ebbed out

door opens malcolm enters
archie sits up from his bed and stares
he tries to bring back some of his old juice tries to stand up

malcolm has to help him lie back

the contrast is shocking malcolm tall and straight archie ruined

i aint got much but no man im doing okay
take it easy
lay down and dont think about it
you could of been something archie but the devil got to you
the old man is asleep
malcolm contd you know all the angles except how to live
malcolm walks thoughtfully down the street archie is still on his mind as he passes prostitute after prostitute
once beautiful women now selling their bodies
he passes laura she has been turned totally out and she looks the part there is no way he can recognize her
we do though
she has just gotten a white john and leads him into an alley
women who could be mothers teachers scientists
laura kneels down to unzip her johns pants
malcolms voice contd who is going to raise our children
men who might have been astronauts composers engineers who is going to be the head of the households
malcolm is addressing a huge audience
his tone is more intense more personal than before because of his recent encounters
in the audience sitting with bembry is betty a lovely dark skinned woman
her interest in malcolm true also for most of the other unmarried sisters is more than religious
and what has the white devil made of them dead souls
oh my he has no conscience
he should fall on his knees and say my kind commits historys greatest crime against your kind every day of your life
but does he
he scorns you splits your head with his nightstick and calls you nigger
if youve had it then stand up and come forward
if not us then who
if not now then when
many stand some walk toward the podium speaking his name im with you brother malcolm praise allah me brother malcolm
there is applause some of the audience get to their feet malcolm acknowledges their approval trying to quiet them but caught up in the heady excitement of leadership
both are moved by malcolms performances
whispering he ought to try to make it a little easier brother bembry
why dont you try telling him that sister betty
the muslim movement has grown enormously
the activity in this anteroom leading to other rooms off it shows that
betty and bembry stand before a directory announcing activities in the temple monday fruit of islam meeting tuesday unity night wednesday student enrollment thursday muslim girls training friday general civilization
class saturday swahili etc
a stir of people and activity as malcolm enters the anteroom
he excuses himself from a group of muslims making his way toward bembry
little out of breath brother bembry can we fix it so our loudspeaker is heard on the street
im sure we can
this is a new sister sister betty
malcolm nods at her she nods in return
bembry contd the sister lectures our muslim women in hygiene and diet
malcolm mutters very good but his mind is clearly on a million other details
bembry contd the sister stresses care of the body and regular eating habits
malcolm is still distracted
the sister wonders if the brother knows what harriet tubman did between taking souls to the promised land
malcolm is stopped
he looks at betty
betty contd and the sister suggests he put his actions where his mouth is
malcolms laughter is heard in response
sure ill speak to your class
but im a hard man on women
you want to know why
if you want to tell me
malcolm sits next to the honorable elijah muhammad
the student and the teacher
if you want to tell me
women are deceitful
they are untrustworthy flesh
ive seen too many men ruined or tied down or messed up by women
betty says nothing she merely pushes the salad plate a little toward him
the food has thus far gone untouched
women talk too much
to tell a woman not to talk is like telling jesse james not to carry a gun or a hen not to cackle
and samson the strongest man that ever lived was destroyed by the woman who slept in his arms
shall i tell my sisters that we oppose marriage
we are not catholic priests
we do not practice celibacy
if a woman is the right height for a man the right complexion if her age is half the mans plus seven if she understands that mans essential nature is
strong and womans weak if she loves children can cook sew and stay out of trouble i think youve made your points brother malcolm
that you havent time for either marriage or eating malcolm chuckles a bit
betty contd and that women arent the only ones who talk a lot
now he bursts out laughing
they are alarmed at brother ministers behavior
if youll start eating there is a question i have
he takes a forkful of the salad
betty contd considering todays standards of animal raising and curing meats i dont fully understand the restriction on pork
let me explain
ill do better than that
ill show it to you
but its demonstration purely in the interest of science you understand
yes i understand brother malcolm
before a comparative evolutionary display showing the skeletons of various animals malcolm is holding forth
betty is dressed in a vivid becoming red dress
notice especially the claw the jaw and the skull formation
this is the rat
this the mole
here you have the aardvark and the boar
all members of the pig rodent family
i see your point
so it is not a matter of the breeding conditions or preparation of the meat
the meat itself is foul
as they saunter out passing the huge skeletons of prehistoric animals now
could we sit down someplace
ive had you on your feet for hours
youve been on your feet for days
and didnt even finish your salad
youre the strawberry soda and youre the hot fudge sundae
he plunks down the order before betty and malcolm
malcolm takes a long long satisfying pull on his straw
then he sighs thats something i havent done in fifteen years
sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda
how do you like it
malcolm contd lets talk about you for a change
theres nothing to talk about
h yes there is
i know a lot about you
brother bembry briefed me
purely scientific interest im sure
a beat youre from detroit near where i come from
you majored in education at tuskegee
youre studying nursing and having trouble with your family
i can handle it
they want you to quit the muslims or they wont pay your tuition isnt that it
you have enough worries of your own
no good sisters are rare
we need every one
tell me something how tall are you
why do you ask
just an idle question
if its just idle i wont answer it
she takes a bite of her sundae
betty contd but brother bembry says im tall enough for a tall man
how old are you betty
theres a few things you dont know about women brother malcolm
theyre possessive and vain
and dogged when i set my mind to something
what have you set your mind to
being a good muslim a good nurse and a good wife
malcolm takes a good look at the lovely woman in front of him then a long sip from his ice cream soda
betty sees him first
as sidney runs to them at the table brother johnson was attacked by the cops
there was a scuffle
the brother was watching
malcolm listening as several witnesses simultaneously describe the attack
a small angry crowd has gathered
the most animated one is benjamin a very dark young black teenager we will soon meet him later
the cop says move on
the brother didnt scatter fast enough for the ofay
he bled like a stuck hog
watcha gonna do
deprecatingly hell rap a little
hes a muslim
and make a speech
muslims talk a good game but they never do nothing unless somebody bothers muslims
malcolms face goes taut
he nods sharply at sidney as benjamin watches them both
i demand to see brother johnson
malcolm facing a desk sergeant two uniformed cops and a plainclothesman off to one side
who the hell are you
im from muslim temple
never heard of you
where is he
the police respond with a squeeze play intended to intimidate malcolm nobody here by that name
whats your name feller
he feels the power play and stiffens in resistance
im minister malcolm x
two witnesses saw him brought in
he was not brought out
you heard the sergeant
malcolm stands his ground coolly
take a look out that window
i intend to see brother johnson
the cops eye each other
plainclothes walks to the window
across from the station is a phalanx of some fifty men of the fruit of islam
all are dressed in dark suits with white shirts
they stand in military formation eyes forward every face burning
people from the neighborhood have formed a crowd behind and around them
we make out benjamin among the crowd
who the hell are they
brothers of brother johnson
eddie lets see that blotter
as the cops examine the police blotter
we got a muslim
the relief must of put it down
but you cant see him
you aint his lawyer
no lawyer no see
until im satisfied brother johnson is receiving proper medical attention no one will move
cops eye each other
plainclothes nods slightly he has to give in malcolm is not playing
the back of malcolms head as he examines brother johnson
as he comes up out of frame we see that johnson has been badly beaten
shaking only a pig could do a thing like that
watch your tongue boy
dont you call me boy you pig
letting a man bleed like that
sergeant puts a restraining hand on plainclothes
malcolm contd that man belongs in a hospital
get an ambulance
as johnsons body on a stretcher is hurried into an ambulance
the crowd has grown in proportions
there are ad libs goddam pigs damn police brutality least they got him out of the meat house
malcolm with the sergeant and a lieutenant as the ambulance pulls away
all right break it up
you got what you wanted
im not satisfied
malcolm starts walking down the center of the street after the ambulance
malcolm contd to the hospital
the fruit of islam fall in behind him marching slowly
it takes on the start of a march as the neighborhood people fall in behind them
people especially kids race with them on the street and on the sidewalk
benjamin fights his way through the crowd trying to walk beside malcolm the brothers in the fruit stop him and benjamin drops back
now the march has taken over the broad avenue
cops are forced to redirect traffic holding up crosstown cars as the group walks solemnly by
the people walking behind have swelled it to a huge demonstration
their faces reflect their anger and their satisfaction that for once something is being done about what has happened
long shot shows the muslim men in perfect order calm with their arms folded across their chests waiting
their eyes are on malcolm as he walks toward the hospital entrance
of the growing crowd
of the nervous cops including some big brass
of kids watching from a rooftop
of benjamin trying to emulate the fruit of islam
malcolm is standing in front of the fruit of islam men as highranking police officer green comes over
all right thats enough
i want these people moved out of here
theyre all disciplined men
theyre doing nothing except waiting
the unruly crowd behind the fruit of islam
they are restive milling ugly
what about them
thats your headache captain
and if he dies i pity you
hes getting the best care we can give
thank you doctor
i had to put a plate in his head
to captain you bastards
all right okay
now disperse this mob
its clear the decision is in one mans hands malcolms
he makes a gesture with his hand the fruit of islam disperse
people moving away going home
only one person remains from the fruit of islam and the crowd its benjamin
thats too much power for one man to have
everyone is in a somber mood over the evenings events
malcolm sits with brothers earl and sidney
brother minister we need to strike back
put fear into those devils
i want to also but until we are instructed by the messenger to do so we will just wait and pray
im tired of praying
thats enough brother earl
benjamin comes into the cafeteria and everyone looks at him
he sees malcolm sitting and moves toward his table
brothers sidney and earl get up to intercept him but malcolm waves him through
sit down son
malcolm pours some cream into his cup of black coffee then also some white sugar
malcolm contd there is only one thing i like integrated
malcolm contd what can i do for you
x i was out there tonight
i saw what you did
i want to be a muslim
i aint never seen a negro stand up to the police like that
they exchange dubious looks
do you know what it means to be a true muslim
malcolm contd do you
not exactly but i want to be one like you
i admire your enthusiasm but you should never join any organization without first checking it out thoroughly
benjamin is crushed and he starts to get up
malcolm contd we need more young warriors like yourself stick around and we shall see if your heart is true
x i wont make you out a liar
an aide of elijah puts down the newspaper and shakes malcolms hand
the honorable elijah muhammad would like to see you now
elijah is sweeping the floor with a plain hand broom
malcolm enters the room is surprised and waits at the door
the two are alone together
if i surprise you let me explain
menial work teaches us humility
let me do it then
no each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing
allah has given you a great gift
use it wisely never forgetting that we are nothing while he is all
the sweeping done they stand together near a table at a window
tonight i shall introduce you as my national representative
it will be a difficult task
your assignment is to build temples all over this nation
more work than you have ever done in your life and you will be in the public eye
my son beware of those cameras they are just as bad as a narcotic
angle aides and others come into the room now
they are listening
elijah contd yes the white devil will watch your every step
even your own brothers will become jealous and hostile go slowly
so i offer you a parable regarding your work
elijah picks up a glass and sets it before malcolm
elijah contd here is a glass dirty and its water foul
if you offer it to the people and they have no choice they must drink out of it
but if you present them with this glass he is holding a clean glass with clear water in it
elijah contd and let them make their decision they will choose the pure vessel
islam is the only religion which addresses the needs and problems of the so called negro especially in the ghettos islam is the only way out from drugs crime unemployment
prostitution alcohol gambling fornication and adultery
elijah holds up the clear glass
this sweet gentle man gave me the truth from his own mouth
and i adored him in the sense of the latin root of the word
adorare to worship and to fear
he was the first man i ever feared not fear such as the one has of a gun but the fear one has of the power of the sun i
pledged myself to him even if it cost me my life
betty is administering to a patient as a phone is heard ringing
another nurse motions betty to the phone
she finishes with her patient and goes quickly
im in detroit
at a gas station
a beat will you marry me
did you hear what i said
yes i did
did you hear my answer
i think so
can you catch a plane
did you eat
i love you
betty and malcolm sit on the floor in the dimlit room very close
it wont be easy
just hold me
it will be rough
hush your mouth
ill be away a lot
youre with me even when youre away
he embraces her
then betty laughs
betty contd i never told you but when i first saw you on the podium cleaning your glasses i felt sorry for you
nobody as young as you should be that serious
but i dont think that anymore
what do you think
the simplest thing in the world i want to have a lot of babies with you
dear heart i love you
were waiting on you folks
you trying to starve us
malcolm has just cut the cake and handed a slice to betty
amid laughter and great warmth sidney unfurls the front page of the messenger the muslim newspaper
headline reads malcolm x weds betty saunders
betty kisses her husband and bembry lorraine earl sidney peter and various brothers and sisters applaud
we notice the subtle change in the apartment it is more comfortable there is even evidence of some small luxury a tv set a new settee etc
malcolm is speaking to a good sized audience i must emphasize at the outstart that the honorable elijah muhammad is not a politician so im not here this afternoon as
a republican nor a democrat not as a mason nor an elk not as a christian nor a jew not as a catholic nor a protestant not as a baptist nor a methodist not even as an american
for if i was an american the problem that confronts our people today would not exist
so i stand here as what i was when i was born a black man
malcolm contd before there were any such things as democrats or republicans we were black
before there were any such things as masons or elks we were black
before there were any such things as jews or christians we were black people
in fact long before there was ever any such place as america we were black people
and after america has long passed from the scene there will still be black people
he is neatly dressed in white shirt jacket and tie a fine young muslim
take your time
the honorable elijah muhammad sits on the stage to the right of malcolm
this is a larger audience
what kind of black people does the honorable elijah muhammad speak for
black people who are jobless
the black masses who are poor hungry and angry the black masses who are dissatisfied with the slums and ghettos in which we have been forced to live
the black masses who are tired of listening to the promises of white politicians to correct the miserable living conditions that exist in our community
the black masses that are sick of the inhuman acts of bestial brutality practiced by these semi savage white policemen that patrol our community like the occupation forces of a
conquering enemy army
the black masses who are fed up with the anemic uncle tom leadership set up by the white man to act as a spokesman for our people and to keep
us if the black man cannot go back to his own people and his own land elijah muhammad is asking that a part of the united states be separated and given to the muslims so they can live separately
malcolm contd the honorable elijah muhammad is the only man the white people can deal with in the solving of problems of the so called negro
malcolm contd as elijah muhammad knows his problems
a modest room
she is rocking a cradle with her foot as she writes attallah is fine
our firstborn is an angel and a beauty
and misses you as i do
but the news that youve dedicated four new temples is almost as good as having you with us
malcolm sits in front of a television screen and watches the evening news
the following speech will be intercut with newsclips from birmingham selma mississippi and elsewhere b police using dogs against demonstrators
c the reverend dr
martin luther king marching
d cattle prods used against men women and children
e the reverend dr
martin luther king singing we shall overcome

the white people who are guilty of white supremacy try and hide their own guilt by accusing the honorable elijah muhammad of teaching black supremacy when he tries to uplift
the mentality the social and economic condition of black people in this country
and the jews who have been guilty of exploiting the black people economically civilly and otherwise hide their guilt by accusing the honorable elijah muhammad of being anti semitic simply
because he teaches our people to go into business for ourselves and trying to take over the economic leadership in our own community
the black people in this country have been the victims of violence at the hands of the white man for years and following the ignorant negro preachers we have thought
that it was god like to turn the other cheek to the brute that was brutalizing us
years ago they use to put on a white sheet and use a bloodhound against negroes
today theyve taken off sheets and put on police uniforms theyve traded in the bloodhounds for police dogs
and just as uncle tom back during slavery used to keep the negroes from resisting the bloodhounds or resisting the ku klux klan by telling them to love their enemy
or pray for those who use them as spitefully today
the honorable elijah muhammad is showing black people that just as the white man and every other person on this earth has god given rights natural rights civil rights and
any other kind of rights that you can think of when it comes to defending himself
with a studio mike around his neck hes on a panel show
x before we start our discussion tonight the black muslims hate mongers would you mind explaining for us the meaning of your name which is the letter x
opposing malcolm is dr
payson a naacp type negro
as you know during slavery time the slavemasters named most of the so called negroes in america after themselves
elijah muhammad teaches us once you come into the knowledge of islam you replace your slave name with an x
since weve been disconnected cut off from our eastern culture for so long that we dont know the names we originally had we will use x until we get back
to the east
x is a demagogue
he has no place to go so he exaggerates
hes a disservice to every good law abiding negro in the country
can i ask you a question
please go ahead
malcolm x why do you teach black supremacy
why do you teach hate
for the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped or the wolf asking the sheep do you hate
the white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone of hate
x you must admit there has been progress
ill talk about progress in a minute but let me finish with my brother
malcolm gestures to the negro panelist
the black members of the tv audience are lapping it up
betty and earl also sit in the tv studio audience
malcolm contd stop me if im wrong
i polarize the community
i erroneously appraise the racial picture
you put it very well
you left one phrase out
another educated kneegrew said to me and i quote brother malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the negro subculture
would you agree
well i have this to say
do you know what a negro with a b
and a ph
is called by the white man
ill tell you
hes called a nigger
there is some blanching and guffawing from the audience
the moderator is totally embarrassed betty roars
malcolm contd and im not finished
to understand this man he points a sharp finger at the negro panelist
malcolm contd you must know that historically there are two kinds of slaves
house negroes and field negroes
the house negro lived in the big house he dressed pretty good he ate pretty good and he loved the master
yeah he loved him more than the master loved himself
if the masters house caught fire hed be the first to put the blaze out
if the master got sick hed say whats a matter boss we sick
if someone said to him lets run away and escape
hed say man are you crazy
whats better than what i got here
that was the house negro
in those days he was called the house nigger
well thats what we call them today because we still got a lot of house niggers running around
there is applause from the blacks in the audience
moderator tries to regain control
he is enjoying this display by his prize student the camera pans to a close shot of bembry and the same cannot be said
i think perhaps dr
payson has something to dont you want to hear about the field nigger
let him finish
now the negro in the field caught hell all day long
he was beaten by the master he lived in a shack wore castoff clothes and hated his master
if the house caught fire hed pray for a wind
if the master got sick hed pray that hed die
and if you said to him lets go lets separate hed yell yeah man any place is better than this
youve got a lot of field negroes in america today
theres another one
the majority of black americans today are field negroes
they dont talk about our progress about our government our navy our astronauts
hell they wont even let you near the plant
bembry turns off the tv set and he commences to plant the seeds of betrayal
your holy apostle dear messenger i am your true servant and the brothers asked me to tell you malcolm is getting too much press
the brothers think he thinks he is the nation of islam that he has aspirations to lead the nation
it was you who made malcolm the man he is
you lifted him out of the darkness
go and tell the brothers what brother minister is doing has done has been of great benefit to the nation
great benefit for himself
malcolm is walking the streets of harlem like he is campaigning for office
he has brothers sidney earl and benjamin at his side a crowd follows him
malcolm sees a wino
brother man put that bottle down take that poison away from your lips
thats what the devil wants you to do stay high out of your natural mind
i know ive been there
the wino looks at malcolm and continues to drink his wine
h malcolm emerges from a doorway to be met by an army of tv reporters armed with microphones
he walks they follow
i malcolm walking in harlem urging people to lift themselves up come to the meetings etc
malcolm sits with benjamin
its time you received your x
but first you must copy this letter exactly as i give it to you down to the dotted is crossed ts everything
and you must go on a fast just water and juices thats it
he takes the letter from malcolm and looks at it
ill have it tomorrow
brother benjamin do not rush it has to be exact
benjamin goes off in a corner and very quickly copies the letter hes so anxious
benjamin hands malcolm his letter malcolm shakes his head and hands it back its not exact
malcolm is talking to a group of people who are having a rent strike
when you live in a poor neighborhood youre living in an area where you have poor schools
malcolm hands him back his letter again
the fast is getting to benjamin
malcolm contd when you have poor schools you have poor teachers
when you have poor teachers you get a poor education
malcolm contd poor education you only work on poor paying jobs and that enables you to live again in a poor neighborhood
malcolm contd so its a very vicious cycle
weve got to break it
benjamin weakly walks toward malcolm and gives him his letter which he takes
the fast is wearing him out
malcolm is inspecting it
his face is filled with apprehension
you are now benjamin x
all praises are due to allah
thank you brother minister
come sit with us
benjamin x sits with malcolm and brothers earl and sidney
we are now sitting with brother benjamin x
you will be good
brother minister can i have something to eat
lets get this man some food
a crowd of students outside the law school
the setting is the same as the last time we saw malcolm and shorty here except now the students part for him
malcolm walks slowly toward the entrance looking up at the latin inscription of the building when he is stopped by a white mr
x ive read some of your speeches and i honestly believe a lot of what you say has truth to it
i have a good heart
im a good person despite my whiteness
what can the good white people like myself who are not prejudiced or racist what can we do to help the cause
he stares at her
she is absolutely crushed and runs away in tears
speaking to a packed student audience
my high school was the black ghetto of roxbury
my college was the streets of harlem and i took my masters in prison
if you look out the window you can see my burglary hangout
i lived like an animal
had it not been for the honorable elijah muhammad i would surely be in an insane asylum or dead
angle the audience carefully listening
muhammad is trying to get us on gods side so god will be on our side to help us fight our battles
when negroes stop getting drunk stop being addicted to drugs stop fornicating and committing adultery
when we get off the welfare then well be men
earn what you need for your family then your family respects you
theyll be proud to say thats my father
shes proud to say thats my husband
father means youre taking care of those children
just cause you made them that dont mean youre a father
anybody can make a baby but anybody cant take care of them
anyone can go and get a woman but anybody cant take care of a woman
this is the type of teaching that the honorable elijah muhammad teaches us so we can build the moral fiber of our people
beginning to scribble furiously
i can see the gentlemen of the press also the fbi and cia
are with us
get it straight cuz if i said mary had a little lamb theyd write malcolm x lampoons poor mary
loud laughter from the audience
but this response is overwhelmed by the response of another larger audience
malcolm is talking before an all black audience
it is the largest rally yet the hall is packed to the rafters
we have built temples in boston in detroit in atlanta philadelphia washington temples in fifty states
from a handful we have grown to scores of thousands
hawkers selling the messenger faces of fruit of islam near the podium lorraine sidney earl benjamin and bembry
for the first time a new note is seen in bembrys face reserve bordering on resentment
when others around him cheer malcolm bembry is cool
sidney notices this from his father but makes no comment
the honorable elijah muhammad teaches us that god is now about to establish a kingdom on this earth based on brotherhood and
against peace his history on this earth has proved that
nowhere in history has he been brotherly toward anyone
the only time he has been brotherly toward you is when he can use you when he can exploit you when he can oppress you when you will submit to
and since his own history makes him unqualified to be an inhabitant or a citizen in a kingdom of brotherhood the honorable elijah muhammad teaches us that god is about
to eliminate that particular race from this earth
so since they are due for elimination we dont want to be with them
malcolm contd if the so called negro were american citizens we wouldnt have a race problem
if the emancipation proclamation was authentic you wouldnt have a race problem
if the th th and th amendments to the constitution was authentic you wouldnt have a race problem
if the supreme court desegregation decision was authentic you wouldnt have a race problem
all of this is hypocrisy
these negro leaders have been telling the white man everything is all right everything is under control
and theyve been telling the white man that mr
muhammad is wrong dont listen to him
but everything mr
muhammad has been saying is going to come to pass is now coming to pass and now the negro leaders are standing up saying that we are about to have
a racial explosion
were going to have a racial explosion and thats more dangerous than an atomic explosion
malcolm contd its going to explode because black people are dissatisfied
theyre dissatisfied now not only with the white man but with these negroes who have been sitting around here posing as leaders and spokesmen for black people
anytime you put too many sparks around a powder keg the thing is going to explode and if the thing that explodes is still inside the house then the house
will be destroyed
so the honorable elijah muhammad is telling the white man get this powder keg out of your house let the black people in this country separate from him while theres
and if the black man is allowed to separate and go on onto some land of his own where he can solve his problems then there wont be any explosion
complete a wave of cheers as people explode
the rally is over
a small room packed with people congratulating malcolm trying to touch him
he is the hero of the hour
sidney earl and benjamin with him enjoying the accolades and trying to help malcolm make his way out
bembry stands apart removed and silent
thank you brother sister how are you
please make way please angle
a well known personality dick gregory is at the door
he and malcolm know each other well
malcolm extends a palm but gregory doesnt slap it
can i ask you something
are you elijahs pimp
scornfully his greatest greatness
say what youre saying
if you dont know man then i feel sorriest for you
betty pregnant with child is in a chair a newspaper in her lap
malcolm is in the other room putting his last daughter to sleep
we hear him
okay last hug
as he enters a smile on his face but the concern of the evening clearly imprinted
he sits down heavily
betty watches him carefully
long ten years
malcolm contd why are you looking at me like that
because youre in trouble
how do you know
dear heart because i know you
i dont want to bring my troubles home
you know that
im not made of glass
i just want to sit here and be still
weve never had a fight
not a real one
but were going to have one right now if you dont talk about it
talk about what
the talk is everywhere
theres always talk always been talk and always will be talk
dont they say how im trying to take over the nation how im getting rich off the nation
well get to that too but this isnt just talk any more
she picks up the newspaper and reads from it betty contd los angeles upi elijah muhammad year old leader of the black muslim movement today faced paternity suits from two
former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children
there are always slanders always lies
youre reading the devils lies
cant you see theyre trying to bring us down bring down the messenger
both women in their s charged they had had intimacies with elijah muhammad since
i was going to talk to bembry about it tonight
is bembry your friend
woman have you lost your mind
whats the matter with you
betty gets up goes to him gently
no whats the matter with you
are you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself
are you so committed you cannot face the truth
bembry is the editor of the newspaper you established
ask him why your name hasnt been in muhammad speaks in over a year
ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the country but not a single sentence in your own
rationalizing im not interested in personal publicity
our people know what im doing
do you know what bembry is doing
youre so blind everyone can see this but you
bembry saved my life
the honorable elijah muhammad saved my life
a long time ago
youve repaid them many times over
ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture
is that what this is about
what do we have malcolm
a broken down jalopy and the clothes on our backs
we dont even own our own home
what about our children
what about me
you dont even own life insurance
the nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me
are you sure
are you sure or are you blind
she touches him very gently
betty contd dear heart you have to help me
im raising our kids practically by myself while youre running all over the world
you dont know how many times the girls ask me when is daddy coming home
what do you want me to do
our people need me
we need you too
what do you want me to do
open your eyes you can face death hours a day but the possibility of betrayal never enters your mind
if you wont do that for yourself do it for us
malcolm knocks on the door of evelyn williams one of the two secretaries wives
she opens the door and has child in her arms
her name is eva marie shes years old
brother minister i did nothing wrong
i did nothing to be put in isolation
i believed in him
i believed in the honorable elijah muhammad
he cannot believe what he is hearing but he must
the truth is before his eyes
sister evelyn believe in allah
malcolm is sitting holding both of the children
sister lucille who is pregnant with rd child waddles across the room to sit down on the sofa with him
she picks up one of the kids from him
this is saudi shes and you have lisha shes
brother minister the honorable elijah muhammad is the father of my children
she touches her pregnant stomach
sister lucille contd brother minister he often talked about you
he loves you loves you like his own son
says you are the best his greatest minister but that someday you would leave him and turn against him
he told you that
are you sure
yes i am brother minister
all i want is support for my children
he should provide for his children
thats all i want
allah will provide
he has said everything on his mind and waits for bembrys answer
what are you talking about blackout
some of the brothers are a little jealous
maybe they think you been a little overpublicized
malcolm is listening closely
bembry puts an arm around him man to man
bembry contd now about our coming up in the world a little
youre not naive
youre a man of the world
the movements grown weve grown with it
you know folks
they want their leaders to be prosperous
one hand washes the other
quoting bembry back to himself im telling you gods words not to hustle
you want a new car
you want a new house
is that it
its the money right
malcolm has to control his rage
we tell the world were moral leaders because we follow the personal example of the honorable elijah muhammad
its hard to make a rooster stop crowing once the sun has risen
the sun is up
we hear rifle shots
malcolm a last minute replacement for the ailing honorable elijah muhammad speaks before a huge crowd
and what do i say of this so called national mourning
the white mans acts are condemned not only by our beliefs but by his own
both his bible and the holy koran say as you sow so shall you reap
both say sow the wind reap the whirl wind
malcolm contd in the soil of america the white man planted the seeds of hate
he allowed the weeds that sprang up to choke the life out of thousands of black men
malcolm contd now they have strangled one of the gardeners
this is the justice of allah
wa salaam alaikum
alaikum wa salaam
dont you have even a little bit of remorse
saddened by president kennedys assassination
assassination might be too good a word and might i add an arabic word at that
this was a prime example of the devils chickens coming home to roost
being an old farm boy myself chickens coming home to roost never did make me sad
it always made me glad
on his desk is the black headlines malcolm x calls assassination chickens coming home to roost
elijahs health is getting worse his coughing is frequent
did you see the papers today
yes sir i did
that was a very bad statement
the country loved this man and you have made it hard in general for muslims
he knows what is coming
elijah contd we must dissociate ourselves from your terrible blunder
ill have to silence you for the next ninety days
you are not allowed to make any statements to the press nor are you to speak at any temples
he looks at elijah his leader his friend his father and speaks with total sincerity
i agree with you sir
i submit percent
malcolm turns around and leaves the room
as the door is being closed we see bembry kneeling before elijah and kissing his hand
the door closes the screen is black
sidney is playing on the floor with the kids
betty scoops them up
cmon girls its bedtime
the phone rings
malcolm answers it
from his expression we know it is a threat call
he hangs up
betty leaves with the kids
how long has this been going on
all day since you and betty left
brother minister i have to level with you
they gave me a mission
but i couldnt do it
i love yall
to wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition
the ministers say you are spreading untruths about the messenger
the ministers say you are a great hypocrite judas benedict arnold
the ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the messengers doorstep
what does sidney say
im with you brother minister
youll be marked for death
let me die then
i wont let myself come between you and your father
youre my father
and dont come back
sidney reluctantly leaves walks out the door past betty
she looks at him then malcolm
malcolm backed by brothers earl and benjamin x faces a roomful of supporters and reporters
because threatens to be a very explosive year on the racial front and because i myself intend to be very active in every phase of the american negro struggle for
human rights i have called this press conference this morning in order to clarify my own position in the struggle especially in regards to politics and nonviolence
in the past i thought the thoughts spoke the words of the honorable elijah muhammad that day is over
from now on i speak my own words and think my own thoughts
internal differences within the nation of islam forced me out of it
i did not leave of my own free will
but now that it has happened i intend to make the most of it
now that i have more independence of action i intend to use a more flexible approach toward working with others to get a solution to this problem
i do not pretend to be a divine man but i do believe in divine guidance divine power and in the fulfillment of divine prophecy
i am not educated nor am i an expert in any particular field but i am sincere and my sincerity is my credentials
im not out to fight other negro leaders or organizations
we must find a common solution to a common problem
i am going to organize and head a new mosque in new york city known as the muslim mosque inc
this gives us a religious base and the spiritual force necessary to rid our people of the vices that destroy the moral fiber of our community
our political philosophy will be black nationalism
our economic and social philosophy will be black nationalism
the muslim mosque inc
will remain wide open for ideas and financial aid from all quarters
whites can help us but they cant join us
there can be no black white unity until there is first some black unity
a host of questions fired all at once how many of elijahs followers will join you
etc etc etc
malcolm calms them malcolm contd there is one further preparation i need
it is a return to the source of our great religion
i will make a pilgrimage to mecca
malcolm at the window as his plane takes off
he is watching betty and the children on the visitors ramp
he sees her become a tiny figure waving a vivid bandana
the plane is out of sight
betty gathers up her children
as they leave she is subtly surrounded by the protecting band of supporters led by earl and benjamin x
my darling betty
everywhere i go i am welcomed as the representative of our people
he watches as malcolm walks between the two pyramids
malcolms voice contd our fight is known and respected worldwide
incidentally theres a little white man who follows me wherever i go
on a camel as he rides toward the sphinx
i wonder who hes working for
if i was a betting man id say cia
whats your guess
i arrived in jedda saudi arabia
i have never witnessed such sincere
betty is reading malcolms letter to a large audience
betty contd hospitality and true brotherhood as practiced here in the ancient home of abraham mohammad and the great prophets of the scriptures
malcolm wearing the garb of a pilgrim walks with a vast throng of others similarly clad around the great temple
he wears two white towels one over his loins the other over his neck and shoulder leaving the right arm and shoulder bare
he wears simple sandals
the other pilgrims are of various colors from white to yellow to darkest black
a malcolm and other pilgrims kneeling together on a praying rug
b malcolm and several white pilgrims eating muslim style breaking a chicken and shaking it
c malcolm and others walking around the great kaaba a black stone set in the middle of the great mosque
he falls to his knees
we see what he describes today with thousands of others i proclaimed gods greatness in the holy city of mecca
wearing the ihram garb i made my seven circuits around the kaaba i drank from the well of zem zem i prayed to allah from mt
ararat where the ark landed
it was the only time in my life that i stood before the creator of all and felt like a complete human being
elijah and a group of black muslim leaders
bembry among them it looks like he is the number two man now that malcolm has been jettisoned
the messenger lies in bed he is having a coughing fit this is the worst condition hes been in
a doctor orders everyone out the room
you may be shocked by these words but i have eaten from the same plate drunk from the same glass and prayed to the same god with fellow muslims whose
eyes were blue whose hair was blond and whose skin was the whitest of whites
and we are brothers truly people of all colors and races believing in one god and one humanity
once before in prison the truth came and blinded me
it has happened again
betty is with brothers earl benjamin x and the children
there are now four including another baby gamilah in the past i have permitted myself to be used to make sweeping indictments of all white people and these generalizations have
caused injuries to some white folks who did not deserve them
because of the spiritual rebirth which i was blessed to undergo as a result of my pilgrimage to the holy city of mecca i no longer subscribe to sweeping indictments
of one race
i intend to be careful not to sentence anyone who has not been proven guilty
im not a racist and do not subscribe to any of the tenets of racism
in all honesty and sincerity it can be stated that i wish nothing but freedom justice and equality life liberty and the pursuit of happiness for all people
malcolm is bent over in prayer lone figure in a huge mosque
my first concern of course is with the group to which i belong the afro americans for we more than any other are deprived of these inalienable rights
malcolm on a plane headed home
i believe the true practice of islam can remove the cancer of racism from the hearts and souls of white americans
a tight two shot of malcolm and betty in an embrace
she breaks from him and whispers go ahead
i can wait now
a large press conference mikes of every network every newspaper and wire service present
malcolm sports a beard
malcolm you said on your trip abroad you sensed a feeling of great brotherhood
as i recall i pointed out that while i was in mecca making the pilgrimage i spoke about the brotherhood that existed at all levels among all people all colors
who had accepted the religion of islam
i pointed out that what it had done islam for those people despite their complexion differences that it would probably do america well to study the religion of islam and
perhaps it could drive some of the racism from this society
muslims look upon themselves as human beings as part of the human family and therefore look upon all other segments of the human family as part of that same family
today my friends are black brown red yellow and white
malcolm are you prepared to go to the united nations at this point and ask that charges be brought against the united states for its treatment of the american negroes
the audience applauds
malcolm contd the audience will have to be quiet
yes as i pointed out that during my trip that nations african nations asian latin nations look very hypocritical when they stand up in the un condemning south africa and
saying nothing about the racist practices that are manifested everyday against negroes in this society
i would be not a man if i didnt do so
i wouldnt be a man
are you prepared to work with some of the leaders of some of the other civil rights organizations
certainly we will work with any groups organizations or leaders in any way as long as its genuinely designed to get results
does the new beard have any religious significance
no not particularly
but i do think that you will and black people in america as they strive to throw off the shackles of mental colonialism will also probably reflect an effort to
throw off the shackles of cultural colonialism
and then theyll begin to reflect desires of their own with standards of their own
one of your more controversial remarks was a call for black people to get rifles and form rifle clubs sometime back
do you still favor that for self defense
i dont see why that should be controversial
i think that if white people found themselves victim of the same kind of brutality that black people in this country face and they saw that the government was either
unwilling or unable to protect them that the intelligence on the part of the whites would make them get some rifles and protect themselves
what about the guns malcolm
has the white man changed since i went away
have you put up your guns
the day you stop being violent against my people will be the day i tell folks to put away their guns
then youre still an extremist
git your hand out of my pocket
everyone turns around to the back to see what the commotion is about
the man who yelled out leaves quickly we will see him later on very soon
malcolm looks out the living room window he has a rifle in hand
note this is the same pose as the famous photograph of him
he doesnt see anyone and closes the curtain
the phone rings
malcolm picks up the receiver
youre one dead nigger
betty has picked up also and shes listening
youre days on this earth are numbered brother
he hangs up
malcolm enters the room and gets into the bed with betty he puts his ear down on his wifes pregnant stomach
she kisses him
get some sleep
you have to sleep for three
malcolm pulls betty closer to him
i havent been the best husband or father
families shouldnt be separated
ill never make another long trip without you and the kids
well all be together
dear heart i love you
we had the best organization that black people ever had and niggers ruined it
it is a cold winter night
a molotov cocktail is lit and hurled through the front picture glass window
one of the children screams
malcolm grabs his pistol and quickly throws a coat over betty
she is half asleep frightened trembling and disoriented
walk out the back dear
malcolm runs back for the children
he reassuringly leads the four children in their pajamas through the smoke filled house
theres nothing to be afraid of
it might be a little cold
well be fine
we cut back to earl little getting his family out of the burning house in lansing michigan
it should be the same exact scene we saw before earlier in the film
get the kids
neighbors lights have gone on
there are shouts what is it
bring those children in here
call the fire department
a hose is playing on the fire
police cars have arrived
there are two reporters with the cops
malcolm faces them furiously
and the fire hit the window and it woke up my second oldest baby but the fire burned on the outside of the house
it could have fallen on six four or two year old girls
and im going to tell you if it had done it idve taken my rifle and gone after anybody in sight
are the muslims behind this
it was bombed by the black muslim movement upon the orders of elijah muhammad
do you know what muslim headquarters is saying
with total contempt i can imagine
i did it myself
for the publicity
bembry is being interviewed by a reporter
we feel this is a publicity stunt on the part of malcolm x
we hope this isnt a case of if he cant keep the house we wont get it either
a car comes roaring down the street with rifles sticking out the windows and pulls right up in front of malcolms house
brothers earl and benjamin x run out of the car up to malcolm
we called your house operator said you had requested that your phone be turned off
give us the command malcolm
i dont care about myself my wife and four children were sleeping in their beds they have nothing to do with this
lets get out of this cold
brothers earl and benjamin take off their coats and put it over malcolm and lead him to a police car
five black men sit around a table
they do not speak
they are thomas hayer ben thomas leon davis william x and wilbur kinley
all are muslims all are the assassins
he puts a roll of exposed mm film into a sock
malcolm is checking in when he is approached by a young white coed
i have a good heart
im a good person despite my whiteness
what can the good white people like myself who are not prejudiced do to help the cause of the negro
he looks at her
let sincere white individuals find other white people who feel as they do and teach non violence to those whites who think and act so racist
i will mr
x i will
lets all pray without ceasing
may allah bless you
malcolm lies on his bed and for the first time we see the strain in his face it has begun to take its toll hes a haunted man
a doomed man
malcolm dials the phone
malcolm where are you
weve been calling all over the city
intercut between malcolm and brother earl
im gonna try and get some work done tonight
let some of us come down there
no that wont be necessary
ill be all right
i wish youd listen to us
what about the meeting tomorrow
we need to frisk people
i dont want folks to be searched it makes people uncomfortable
if i cant be safe among my own kind where can i be
allah will protect me
there is silence on the other end
the five assassins are casing ballroom
they check the different entrances the exits the bathrooms staircases while the jam packed crowd continues to dance the night away
betty is putting her four daughters to sleep when the phone rings
she picks it up
that red nigger of yours is dead and so are your bastard children
betty hangs up the phone and it rings again
stop calling us
leave us alone
leave us alone
ill kill you

betty its me
intercut between between malcolm and betty
malcolm they keep calling threatening us
im going crazy when is this going to stop

its all right
its all right
nothing is gonna happen to anybody
dear heart where are you
at the hilton
the girls asleep

i dont think thats such a good idea
a blue cadillac passes a sign that says patterson new jersey
the assassins are on their way to the audubon ballroom wilbur kinley is behind the wheel no one is talking
betty is driving to the audubon ballroom her four daughters are in the backseat making a racket
malcolm drives to the audubon ballroom
brothers earl and benjamin x along with some others are putting the folding chairs in place for the coming meeting
the audience has not started to come in yet
the assassins are driving over the george washington bridge
brothers the time is fast approaching its the hour of the knife
betty is trying to quiet down her daughters as she drives
malcolm is in deep thought as he drives
betty and her four kids walk into the ballroom and move down the center aisle
one of the girls drops her black doll and a young man picks it up
the young man is thomas hayer he gives it back to her
say thank you
you are welcome
the rest of the assassins come in and go to their positions along with the rest of the crowd the place is starting to fill up
no sign of the minister yet
hell be here like clockwork
malcolm drives past the audubon ballroom people are going in but no cops are present
malcolm drives by
malcolm parks his car its four blocks away
he turns off the ignition and sits there
its as if hes frozen in his car
malcolm finally gets out of the car locks the door and walks a couple of steps then stops
malcolm has stopped in his tracks like some unseen force has overcome him which prevents him from moving
malcolm is paralyzed
his eyes are closed and the street noise begins to build to a deafening roar
then all of a sudden it stops
son you all right
malcolm opens his eyes she has brought him out of it
he looks at her but doesnt answer
old woman contd are you okay
malcolm looks at this old woman who slightly resembles his own mother
maam im fine
we need you
i recognize you dont pay them folks no never mind you keep on doing what you doing
may allah bless you
ill pray for you too son
jesus will protect you
she walks away carrying her two shopping bags full of groceries
malcolm walks in
present are brothers earl benjamin x and a secretary sister robin
is the program ready
no brother minister
youve had ample time you and the sister
i apologize brother minister well have it next week
he is pissed

benjamin you better go out there and explain why the program isnt ready today
benjamin x gets up to leave
sister please go with the brother
they both exit
brother minister what is wrong
the way i feel i ought not to go out there today
in fact im going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself thats all a part of the white mans big maneuver to
keep us fighting amongst ourselves against each other
im not fighting anyone thats not what were here for
is my family here yet
down front as always
a lone cop in uniform stands in the shadows with a walkie talkie
malcolm is about to go on stage when he sees sister robin
youll have to forgive me for raising my voice to you
brother minister i understand
to himself i wonder if anybody understands
the place is filled
betty and the girls sit in a boxed off section near the platform
malcolms bodyguards stand on and around the stand
benjamin x is finishing up his speech when malcolm walks onto the stage and sits down
make it plain
and now without further remarks i present to you one who is willing to put himself on the line for you benjamin x contd a man who would give his
life for you
i want you to hear to listen to understand one who is a trojan for the black man
a roar greets malcolms intro
he shakes hands with benjamin x then steps toward the podium
he starts to rearrange his x index cards in his hands
brothers and sisters wa salaam alaikum
alaikum wa salaam
there is a commotion in the rear of the audience
git your hand out of my pocket
the bodyguards move toward the rear
hold it brothers
dont get excited
lets cool it he stands up from the fourth row with gauge sawed off shotgun blasting
throws up his hands grabs his chest and is knocked backward
people hit the floor knock over chairs stampede for the exits
wilbur kinley ignites a smoke bomb
thomas hayer and leon davis stand up run toward the stage and empty their
s and luger into the fallen body of malcolm
she is on the floor covering her children
hayer and davis charge up the aisle toward the rear exit shooting at the crowd
he stands in hayers way hayer fires he turns the bullet misses and the bodyguard gets off a shot which hits hayer in the leg
he stumbles momentarily then limps on
hayer is running down the staircase when he is tripped and goes flying through the air to the bottom of the landing
the crowd starts to beat the shit out of him kicking him in the head etc
theyre about to tear him apart from limb to limb when a patrolman enters with gun drawn
he shoots gun into air and the crowd backs off and he takes custody of hayer
one of malcolms bodyguards brother gene is over him giving him mouth to mouth resuscitation
brother gene stops betty moves in and hugs her dying husband
somebody call an ambulance
somebody call an ambulance
thirty cops walk in like its a spring sunday stroll in central park
his eyes are glazed over
they killed him
they killed him
the person you know as malcolm is no more
ossie davis speaking behind the above here at this final hour in this quiet place harlem has come to bid farewell to one of its brightest hopes extinguished now and
gone from us forever
c dolly shot of the long line of people outside the funeral parlor waiting to see malcolms body where it lies before burial
ossie daviss voice contd for harlem is where he worked and where he struggled and fought
his home of homes where his heart was and where his people are
and it is therefore most fitting that we meet once again in harlem to share these last moments with him
for harlem has ever been gracious to those who loved her have fought for her and defended her honor even to death
it is not in the memory of man that this beleaguered unfortunate but nonetheless proud community has found a braver more gallant young champion than this afro american who lies
before us unconquered still
many will ask what harlem finds to honor in this stormy controversial and bold young captain and we will smile and we will answer and say unto them ordinary people
in ordinary pursuits of life black people still struggling to stay afloat in a racist white america that does not have their best interests at hand years of reagan and now at least years of bush
ossie daviss voice contd did you ever talk to brother malcolm
did you have him smile at you
did you ever listen to him
did he ever really do a mean thing
was he ever associated with violence or any public disturbance
ossie daviss voice contd for if you did you would know him and if you knew him you would know why we must honor him
ossie daviss voice contd malcolm was our manhood our living black manhood
that was his meaning to his people and in honoring him we honor the best in ourselves
a picture collage of malcolm x
it reads p
harlem honors malcolm on his birthdate may
ossie daviss voice contd and we will know him then for what he was and is
a prince a black shining prince who didnt hesitate to die because he loved us so
its a fourth grade class
im malcolm x
im malcolm x
im malcolm x
im malcolm x
im malcolm x
im malcolm x
im malcolm x
im malcolm x
camera pans slowly to head of class where the teacher stands its as brother malcolm said we declare our right on this earth to be a man to be a
human being to be respected as a human being in this society on this earth in this day which we intend to bring into existence by any means necessary
