written by david loughery october a two story california craftsman with a sold sign in the front yard
yukon suv pulls into the drive and stops
the drivers door opens and derek charles steps out a handsome and likable african american in his early s a guy whos fought hard to make himself a success in
business and life
derek wears a business suit and the first thing he does is cross the lawn to the sold sign
with a new homeowners look of satisfaction derek grips the sold sign and pulls it out of the ground
d erek looks over to where his pretty wife beth is standing beside the suv holding their cute year old son kyle in her arms
beth shakes her head with amusement
what are you going to do with that
the sold sign now in pieces burns brightly in the fireplace
the rest of the room is empty except for kyle who is nearby asleep in his stroller
derek and beths voices drift down from upstairs
this is coming down
do you want people to think we put it up
soft chuckle i dont know
i kind of like it
please tell me youre joking
derek and beth stare up at their own reflections in a huge ceiling mirror
the rest of the room is vacant
all im saying before we take it down
maybe we should try it out
christen the new house
and what do you suggest we use for a bed
what do we need a bed for when weve got a fine shag carpet
because im gonna have fine shag carpet tattoos all over my derek puts his arms around her waist and pulls her close
beth resists but only slightly
beth contd dont you have to go to work
nuzzling her neck told em id be late
that boy wouldnt wake up if a nuclear bomb went off
maybe not but the movers
wont be here for another hour
beth smiles giving in
they look up at themselves in the mirror like naughty teenagers
derek you are so bad
isnt that why you married me
as they begin to kiss passionately
distorted images of derek and beth in the mirrors reflection naked bodies intertwined making love on the carpet
kyle continues to snooze in his stroller
outside the window a moving van arrives and blows its horn
beth drowsing in dereks arms
they stir at the sound of the horn
want me to stay
crack the whip on these guys
go to work and earn that promotion
somebodys got to pay for all this
they share a quick kiss and then beth swings over to find her clothes
as beth dresses derek stares up at himself
he smiles with satisfaction
life is good
overs bring in furniture placing a big glass table in the dining room area below the stairs
nearby beth opens a box and removes family pictures
she arranges them with loving care on the mantle above the fire place
framed photos of derek and beth in their early dating days at their wedding celebrating holidays beth pregnant the birth of kyle photos illustrating the history of this happy family
picture of beth and kyle smiling at him from the dash derek drives the freeway toward the skyscrapers of downtown
he listens to the stock and financial report
then switches over to cd and gnarls barkleys gone daddy gone blares out
the two sides of derek charles
c angling down from a towering glass and steel office building as dereks yukon enters the parking garage
derek and several others ride up from the parking garage
derek scans the business page of a folded newspaper
he elevator stops on the ground floor the door slides open and more people get on
the doors shut and the car ascends
t other floors people get on and off until its just derek and one other passenger lisa sheridan balancing an arm load of thick files
shes in her mid s white beautiful glasses and hair pulled back projecting an efficient smart and sophisticated look simple blouse and skirt high heels great legs
lisa glances over at derek intrigued
derek looks up from his paper with a distracted smile
i couldnt help but notice were both going to seven
i work there
i thought you might
do you have an appointment with us
do i look like a client
actually you do
pleasant laugh ell i hate to shatter the illusion but im just a lowly temp
genuinely surprised youre a temp
just here for the day
well you could have fooled me
lisa shifts on her feet
im beginning to think these heels were a big mistake
derek glances down at her shapely legs
lisa contd i should have worn my track shoes
theyve got me running all over town picking up these disclosure thats when the pile in her arms slides south
the files fall to the floor and spread out in a mess
lisa laughs and drops to her knees
lisa contd god im such a klutz
derek bends down to help
their hands touch briefly
happen to anybody
they straighten up look at each other
he door slides open revealing the sleek and vast offices of thanks
i owe you one
camera follows derek through a warren of cubicles where staff workers attend phones and computers
he becomes aware that lisa is right behind him
with humor are you following me
im taking these files to mister charles office
they said it was this way
i guess you probably know him
oh yeah i know him
lowers his voice kind of an asshole takes himself waaaay too seriously
but dont tell him i said that
l i could get you into trouble
approaching a desk where dereks assistant a mild looking man in his late s named patrick looks up and smiles
across from patrick is another desk and another assistant a middle aged woman named marge
hows the new house
lucky for me i sneaked out as soon as the movers showed up
beth must have loved that
if she calls mad and she will tell her im in a meeting
remember who used to sit at this desk
shell know i am lying
with a smile good point
patrick chuckles as derek enters his office and vanishes inside
patrick notices lisa standing there with her arm load of files
to lisa can i help you
lisa stares at dereks office
thats derek charles
lisa breaks into a smile obviously charmed
patrick takes amused notice of lisas interest in derek
patrick contd watch it girl
the good ones are always married
dramatic sigh or straight
derek sits at a long table with his silver haired boss joe gage and his best friend and co worker ben kingman
one wall of the room is glass giving a view of the outer office activity
g to derek did you talk to our german friend herr ganz
matter of fact i just got off the line to berlin
ganz doesnt like the way the stock markets been gyrating and he thinks the hedge fund wave is about to crest
you think hes right
i think hes a hundred percent wrong
we havent even gotten close to that point yet
hedge fund demand is coming from individual investors which is why its gaining mainstream acceptance
you know ganz
he gets paranoid when anything goes mainstream
he started making auf wiedersehen noises but i managed to talk him into a private equity portfolio instead
to the tune of mil
i knew there was a reason i promoted you
no offense ben
none taken joe
im just honored to be allowed to exist in dereks world
derek looks over at ben who winks at him
theyre friends and good natured ribbing is part of their relationship
i want you to throw derek all your support on this one
hats when lisa walks by on the other side of the glass
gage perks up
gage contd whose legs are those
never seen em before
i think shes one of the temps
you mean temptress
remind me to call that agency and have them send over a couple more just like her
doesnt hurt to have a little eye candy around the office does it boys
derek merely nods
hes not comfortable with this tone of sexism
end of the day
workers are leaving
derek passes an open office door
ben sticks his head out
i scored an extra lakers ticket for tomorrow night
think you can get free
im moving into a new house
do i look like a man who wants a divorce
i could call and say its a work emergency
thanks but i think ill stay married instead
ben ducks back into his office
derek walks past a cubicle on their way to the elevator
good night mister charles
derek stops turns and sees lisa sitting at a computer station
l isa contd you punkd me
sorry but you set me up
with humor dont worry
ill get my revenge
and by the way you might like to know everybody who works here strongly disagrees with you
about derek charles being an asshole
they all say hes the nicest guy in the firm
well that just proves hes got em all fooled
and hes humble too
im lisa by the way
well it was nice to meet you lisa sheridan
good luck with your next job erek continues on to the elevator
lisa calls after him
actually theyre keeping me on a few more days so ill probably see you on monday
cant tell if he heard
lisa watches him go out of sight then curious she turns to her computer and pulls up dereks bio and picture on the company web site derek charles graduated from
ucla with a major in finance
began his career with major wall street brokerage firm before joining gage bendix working with clients to help them accomplish their investment objectives
from asset allocation and investment planning pension analysis etc
kyle is asleep in his crib
derek and beth look down on him smiling then move quietly toward the door
before they can sneak out kyle lets out a cry
they look at each other
almost made it
erek returns to the crib and picks up kyle
hey little man
you should be
feeling him uh oh
in the doorway with a laugh ive been changing him all day
derek carries kyle over to the changing table opens kyles diaper and turns away
whats that woman been feeding you
derek and beth sit at a table on the outside deck that overhangs a sheer drop to the canyon below
in the distance the la basin sparkles like a diamond in the night
derek and beth are happy but exhausted
in front of them is an empty pizza box
derek picks up a bottle of champagne and pours some for beth and himself
theyre both a little drunk
well we toasted the house toasted kyle your promotion but ive saved the most important toast for last
raising his glass to my beautiful wife who i love and adore more than anything in the world
and to my handsome husband
i asked for the moon and he gave me the stars
hey clink glasses and drink
beth contd derek
how would you feel about trying out that mirror again
this time in our own bed
perks up yeah
give the magic mirror another test drive
you know how i like looking at your sexy butt
beth you are so bad
isnt that why you married me
derek arrives to find lisa sitting at his outer desk in patricks place
she looks up and smiles
shes not wearing her glasses and her hair is down giving her a softer less severe look
lisa sheridan girl temp
out with the flu
i did some trading with the other temps and wrangled your desk
i hope thats okay
looking over at the assistant outside the other corner office
derek contd hey marge
good morning derek
back to the temp
grab your pad and follow me
derek goes into his office
lisa collects her things and does as told
derek goes behind the desk as lisa enters and sits down on the couch
she crosses her legs
those great legs
i put a memo on your desk about the christmas party this friday
is it that time already
derek picks up the memo and scans it
why dont they invite spouses
to the christmas party
it says for employees only
its like that in most companies
they think people are more inhibited in front of their spouses less likely to kick back and enjoy themselves and mingle with co workers which is what the party is
so does this party get pretty wild
just the opposite
well thats no fun
derek notices a container of starbucks coffee
lisa contd called patrick
he said you like it black with two sugars
derek is impressed
he opens the container
lisa contd if its cold i can run down and nuke it in the break room
takes a sip no its perfect
lisa is pleased
she raises her pad and pencil
well its monday and first thing on monday
i took care of that
took care of what
on mondays you always send your wife a dozen long stemmed red roses
off dereks look of surprise i called to confirm theyve been delivered
i think thats incredibly sweet
how long have you two been married
three years in march
and you still send her flowers every monday morning
its kind of a tradition
patrick said you started sending them back when beth worked here as your assistant
is that how you won her heart
well it took a little more than roses
getting down to business we need to run some calls
ready when you are
are you always this efficient
does that surprise you
well its just that most of the temps we get here
i think youll find im not your typical temp
okay not your typical temp
start with phil trendle at emerson
set up a lunch for end of the week
wherever he wants but push the water grill
then terry mills at imagio
am i going too fast for you
i can handle it
beth is feeding kyle while talking on the phone to derek
its a beautiful little park with a duck pond and close enough to push kyle
intercutting derek in his office while he listens and goes over reports
beth contd ive already met a dozen other women with kids the same age
one of them lauren something asked if wed like to come over for a barbecue on saturday
i dont know
its shaping up to be a work weekend
outside at her desk lisa eavesdrops on her headset listening with interest
you can work at home and then well go to the barbecue
s beth chats on derek gets a weird feeling
still on the phone he slowly gets up from his desk and moves quietly to the door
he looks out expecting to catch lisa listening in
instead shes not at her desk
shes standing several feet away at a file cabinet
she turns and smiles at him
do you need me
derek shakes his head no and steps back into his office
derek finishes some work on his home computer
in the background beth sits in bed reading a book
work at the office
this is home
come to bed
in a sec
he rises walks over to the bed and climbs in beside beth
she puts her book on the night table and switches off the light
they cuddle together
beth the card that came today with the roses
was addressed to betty
with humor your other wife
blame it on the new girl
patrick called in sick and i had a temp on my desk
i thought we had a deal
no female assistants
honey i dont control the temp pool
derek gives beth a look
eth contd just asking
yeah shes pretty
i dont care
i want her fired immediately
actually she did a great job
aside from the card
they get comfortable
beth puts her head on dereks chest
beth laughs gives him a playful punch
two delivery guys come out of the stairwell struggling with an undecorated christmas tree
marge directs them to a spot to put it
beth and kyle are visiting
derek has kyle on his desk letting him play with his keys
hope you dont mind us dropping in unannounced
this is a treat
sheilas meeting us for lunch at central market
then im taking kyle to the grove
to kyle and who are we going to see at the grove
to derek you want to come
get your picture taken on santas lap
id love to but im all jammed up
but say hi to your sister
that guy she was seeing the one we met at thanksgiving
the one she said was perfect
apparently hes not so perfect
he told her he just wants to be fwb
friends with benefits
what does that mean
sex but no commitments
and sheilas got a problem with that
lisa appears at the door
lisa smiles sweetly
lisa this is my wife beth
shes temping for patrick
friendly but checking her out hi
its great to meet you mrs
eyes lighting up and this must be kyle
i can already tell hes going to grow up to be a heartbreaker
lisa comes over
kyle presses shyly against derek
lisa contd hi kyle
when kyle doesnt respond
kyle say hello
he can say hello
hes usually not this shy around strangers
what a handsome boy
to derek he looks just like you
actually most people think he takes after beth
talk about the perfect family
the three of you should be on a magazine cover
i hope my husbands not working you too hard
cheery tone he is
but i like it
im learning a lot
to derek joe gage needs to see you when you get a minute
well thats our cue to leave
we just dropped in to say hi
taking kyle from derek come on big boy
lisa steps back moves off to the door
it was great to meet you
she did it on purpose winking at derek
you said laura
if lisa knows shes being fucked with she doesnt show it
beth contd sorry
say hi to santa for me
to beth that was intentional
so whats the deal with her
what do you mean
she knew i was taking kyle to santa
so she was obviously listening at the door
well she probably didnt know when to come in
i thought you said she was plain
derek that girl may be a lot of things but one of them is not plain
how would i know
i only have eyes for you
b oh you are so slick
they put kyle in his stroller
ill walk you to the elevator
you can say hi to the old gang
ever miss it
i like to think i traded up
they share a kiss
derek beth and kyle are surrounded by office workers making a fuss over beth and kyle
even joe gage comes out of his office to embrace beth and chat
lisa watches from a distance
her face betrays no emotion
after a moment she turns and enters dereks office
isa sits behind the desk in dereks chair and look at a framed picture on dereks desk derek beth and kyle the perfect happy family
nearby lisa sees a pile of cds
she looks through them and smiles with an idea
a warm la morning with a hot sun coming up
derek drives to work listening to gnarls crazy
workers hang bulbs and decorations on the christmas tree
a festive holiday spirit is in the air
derek exits the elevator heads to his office
patrick is back at his desk
d hey patrick
you know its going to take more than the flu to keep me away from that christmas party
not sure we can say the same for marge
derek turns to see lisa now sitting at marges desk
you get around dont you
poor thing called in with a fever
shes not speaking to me at the moment
he three share a laugh
you two behave yourselves out here
erek goes into his office
we stay with patrick and lisa
whispers to lisa so how many times did you get busted listening in on dereks calls
light laugh im way too devious to ever get caught
besides i thought all you assistants listened in
with a smile we do
lisa wonders if she might make a friend here
how long have you worked here
ten years this spring
ill bet you know more about what goes on behind these closed doors than anybody
oh you got that right girl
i know all the dirty little secrets
well maybe we should grab a drink some night after work for a little girl talk
lonely guy flattered by her listen honey if you think you can buy my silence with a couple of cosmos
they share a laugh bonding
deserted at lunch hour
derek in shirtsleeves emerges from his office and approaches the break room
derek enters opens the refrigerator and takes out a lunch bag
he hears a slight sniffling noise turns and is surprised to find lisa seated a corner table a little tearful
lisa looks up quickly wipes her eyes with her hand and puts on a smile
i thought everybody was at lunch
an awkward moment
lisa starts to rise
lisa contd i should go
i was just gonna take this back to my office
lisa sits back down
derek starts to leave hesitates
derek contd anything i can do to help
if you want to talk about it
most people i know dont cry over nothing
with humor you think i was crying
this is just my allergies
what are you allergic to
actually its more like theyre allergic to me
lisa hesitates wondering if she can confide
its stupid really
a beat this guy ive been seeing just calls and dumps me
middle of the day
just i dont think we should see each other anymore
thats pretty cold
how long were you together
small laugh actually it was one of my longer lasting relationships
i dont know what it is but sooner or later i just seem to scare men off
im starting to think theres something wrong with me
derek sits down beside her
he puts a comforting hand on her shoulder
like a big brother nothing wrong with you
your boyfriends a fool thats all
i wish i could believe that
maybe you just havent met the right guy yet
im beginning to think all the good ones are taken
d look im no expert but if it didnt work out maybe it wasnt meant to be
when the right guy comes along
youll know it
she looks up at him smiles
is that how it was with you and beth
we both knew pretty quick
love at first sight
it does happen
now im jealous
shes got it all
perfect husband perfect child perfect marriage
there are problems in every relationship
the important thing is to keep moving forward
trying to buck her up dont get down on yourself
youre a bright attractive girl
any man would be lucky to have you
if i was single
but youre not
i just meant
youre just trying to make me feel better
touches his hand and you have
lisa gets up
lisa contd thanks derek
hang in there
she smiles and exits
ncident forgotten derek opens his lunch bag and takes out a sandwich
en appears in the doorway grins at derek
what was that all about
poor kid got dumped by her boyfriend
i wouldnt mind taking up the slack
that is one hot piece of ass there
off dereks look like you havent noticed
hey im a happily married man
and so are you
doesnt mean we cant look
ben goes to the refrigerator opens it and starts rooting around
ben contd not like the old days back when you could get away with a little office nookie on the side and not get nailed for it
turns and gives him a grin dont give me that im appalled look
thats how you got together with beth isnt it
ben if youre looking to start something with that girl
you saw her first
besides i dont think im her type
now you on the other hand
ben do me a favor
all im just sayin is a lot of these single gals see the work place as a hunting ground
cocking his finger like a gun and this ones got you in the cross hairs
with a grin ben pulls the trigger bang
derek looks a little annoyed
c derek at his desk
he notices an envelope with his name on it
he opens the envelope
a note and a home made cd slide out
thanks for the shoulder lisa
thought you might like these
curious derek feeds the cd into his computer lowers the volume and is hit with gnarls barkley in concert
he turns down the volume and smiles continues to listen
he hear the ding of an im on his computer
its from derek considers types back
reply concert bootleg
we could be he responds worth the risk
i luv gnarls
reply me he responds thanx

she replies gone daddy gone
derek smiles then goes back to work
beth and derek at the table
derek is feeding kyle
we can see a naked undecorated christmas tree in the next room

ill have to do it tomorrow

well if you drink too much take a cab okay
if its anything like last year ill be home early
kyle i want you to eat this
kyle shakes his head no and points at the christmas tree
and hes coming soon
dont you know santa only brings presents to boys who eat all their food
kyle considers then furiously eats
derek and beth laugh
derek sits at the bar by himself reading the paper
he looks up and sees lisa come in
lisa catches dereks eye surprised
then she smiles starts to make her way over
gesturing to the empty stool next to him this seat taken
always a good guy no
be my guest
lisa is sitting next to derek at the bar
the food has come
derek contd still the best burger in town
lisa chews and nods in agreement
erek contd contd and the best margarita
raises her eyebrows really
we used to cut loose here after a long day at work
work hard play hard
back in the day
hows that boyfriend trouble coming

how about you derek
whats the grand plan

not with me in charge
they both smile
you want one
oh i dont know
cmon big talker
its christmas time
works dead dereks not sure
lisa contd i wont tell if you dont
what do you like
the christmas party is in full swing with music two bartenders and lowered lights
the tree is all lit up
the mood is happy and playful and people are getting a little tipsy
a male worker gives a female worker a back massage with a computer mouse
joe gage in a santa suit is passing out gag presents
lisa is in a group with patrick and some other women chatting
she glances over and sees derek
hes off to the side with ben sipping drinks
esks and furniture are shoved back and workers are free style dancing crowding into the center of the room
arge grabs derek by the arm and pulls him out
derek makes some half hearted dance moves then gets into the spirit
its crowded people are close together and a moment later derek finds himself dancing face to face with lisa
with humor well if it isnt the office asshole
thats mister office asshole to you
you can dance
all those years watching soul train
i wasnt sure i was going to come tonight
well its not like ive been here that long
im sure everybodys glad you decided to show up
what do you mean even me
im your number one supporter around here
this makes her smile happily
looking up uh oh
derek looks up too
theyre under the mistletoe
how did that get there
they look at each other smile
an awkward moment
derek laughs it off
maybe a quick one on the cheek
if we dont people will really suspect theres something going on
but derek steps away
guess well just have to take that chance
good natured laugh coward
the music changes breaking the mood
derek smiles at lisa and slips away rejoining ben
erek looks at his watch
youre not thinking about bailing are you
funs just getting started
remember last year
sally sloane did a table dance
e indicates a pretty secretary laughing and accepting another drink
ben contd i give her one more drink then stand back
how about you buddy
need a re fill
come on wheres your holiday spirit
with beth and kyle
im gonna take a piss and sneak out
youre no fun
derek heads down the hall a little unsteady
no one else around
he goes to the urinal and begins to unzip
about seconds later he hears the door open and close but thinks nothing of it because it is a large public mens restroom in the workplace with urinals and stalls
but suddenly a hand snakes around his waist and grabs his crotch
derek whirls around face to face with a brazen smiling lisa who dangles a sprig of mistletoe in her free hand
her eyes flash with desire
what are you doing
lisa tries to kiss him
he staggers away from the urinal with lisa still holding him
derek contd lisa they knock open a stall door and fall in
derek goes back against the toilet and lisa is now practically straddling him
d erek contd lisa stop why
are you out of your thats when someone comes in
derek kicks the stall door shut with his foot just in time
he and lisa freeze pressed close together as a drunk male worker staggers to the urinal and unzips
lisa hides a giggle
derek is horrified theyll be discovered
the drunk begins to piss
and then begins to sing santa claus is coming to town
even more loud
in the stall lisa and derek are face to face
his hand grabs her wrist as she squeezes his crotch
he tries to remove it but her grip is like a vice
derek contd for gods oh come on
hearing something the drunk hesitates in mid piss looks back over his shoulder
hey whos there
derek is trapped
lisa gives him a naughty smile
shes in control and enjoying this turned on by the thrill of getting caught
drunk contd somebody in there
lisa is about to answer
derek hushes her
when theres no reply the drunk resumes pissing
lisa smears the mistletoe sprig against dereks face then starts to go down on him
he clutches her head with both hands forcing her to stop
she looks up at him eyes gleaming with passion
dont do this
the drunk continues his piss
he clumsily zips back up lurches over to the sink
he looks at himself in the mirror runs his fingers through his hair smiles at himself and then stumbles out the door
the stall door bangs open as derek pushes lisa aside and staggers out trying to zip up his fly
where are you going
youve got the wrong idea
lisa doesnt seem to understand but shes amused
derek is already out the door
its a wilder scene now
sally sloane is doing an uninhibited table dance to the delight of everyone gathered
atrick standing off sees derek hurry down the hall and head for the elevator
moment later he sees lisa come down the hall and rejoin the party
a little tipsy he walks over to her
living dangerously arent we
oh patrick youre such an old queen
dance with me
lisa pulls patrick out with the other dancers
lisa contd as they dance teasing ll bet youve never been this close to an actual woman
honey ive never been this close to an actual man
derek drives home
hes agitated trying to calm down trying to make sense of what happened
thats when he hears a siren
dereks eyes go up to the rear view mirror in panic as a police car with flashing lights gains on him
derek pulls over heart pounding
this is all he needs right now
the police car flies by on its way to some emergency
derek closes his eyes lets out a deep breath
swept by headlights as derek pulls into the drive
derek looks in on his sleeping son
derek approaches the bed where beth sleeps
he slips in beside her
how was the party
i only stayed for two drinks
that dull huh
a long beat
derek considers telling her
not tonight honey okay
im really tired
and beth is already back asleep
derek lies there in hell
he looks up and sees his own dark reflection in the ceiling mirror
c derek gets off the elevator and walks to his office turns a corner and sees lisa coming the other way carrying files
derek tenses and stops expecting the worst
lisa merely gives him a pleasant smile and walks by
like the other night never happened
lisa continues on her way delivering the files to a co worker
erek stands there observing lisa wondering
ben appears beside derek
you okay bro
derek turns a little startled
he registers ben
you should have stuck around
the christmas party
hank in human services tossed his cookies on the christmas tree
barely registering really
sorry i missed that
derek goes to his office
ben goes to his
erek is at his desk working
lisa appears in the doorway
derek looks up tensing
joe wants to know if youre done with the ganz portfolio
tell him hell have it end of the day
starts to go thanks
youre working joes desk
just for today
light laugh hes a real screamer isnt he
dont let him fool you
his bark really is as bad as his bite
lisa smiles and exits
derek is thinking great maybe she doesnt remember
derek is at his desk working
its the end of the day and workers are leaving
patrick appears at the door
okay if i take off
yeah go home
see you tomorrow
through the open door derek can see other workers leaving getting on the elevator
lisa is one of them
she doesnt even look his way
derek relaxes goes back to his work
derek walks to his yukon suv the only car remaining
he beeps it and the doors unlock
as derek opens the drivers door and slides inside the passenger door opens and lisa slips in wearing her overcoat and an intimate smile
what are you i owe you an apology for the christmas party
i think i sort of took you by surprise
we both had a few drinks
just forget it
l what if i cant
all right have it your way
lisa lets the front of her overcoat fall open
shes naked underneath
jolt of panic you really need to get out of my car
this is so not right
nobodys around to see us now
god i almost went insane today didnt you
having to go pretend like i was concentrating on work when all i could think about lisa get out of my car
startled confused derek whats wrong
what did i do
derek suddenly reaches across her and throws open the passenger door
i dont know if youre just dense or whats wrong with you but i want you to understand something
theres nothing going on between us
i would never never jeopardize my job with a co worker
maybe you are an asshole
derek physically forces her out
derek quickly turns the key in the ignition revs the engine and peels out in reverse
the passenger door bangs shut
lisa stands there in her overcoat staring in mute disappointment as derek speeds out of the parking garage
derek lets himself in determined to tell beth everything
derek heads for the dining room
theres something i need to
he stops seeing beth at the table looking upset with a bottle of wine and a glass
derek contd whats wrong
ive been on the phone for the last hour with rachel more hendricks
beth contd she found out tims been having an affair with a neighbor and its been going on for the last year and a half
stops dead tim
derek sits down at the table
at first i couldnt even conceive of it
theyve always seemed to be so much in love totally devoted to each other
just blurted it out last night when he came home from work
then he said he was moving out
you know theyve got three kids
poor rachels a wreck
its a disaster
if it was me
beth you know id never cheat on you
derek reaches across the table and takes her hand
e moves closer and puts an arm around her
tims an idiot
hes a son of a bitch
beat then what did you want to tell me
theres no way he can tell her now
just a little problem at work
derek contd nothing i cant take care of
derek agitated has confided in ben whos both concerned and a little turned on
why didnt you tell me
there was nothing to tell
nothing to tell
she grabbed your cock
flashed her tits in your car
come on man
i thought i was your best friend
you think this is funny
i mean i kinda got she was interested but i never figured shed
what the hell did i do
i was nice to her thats all
sure you didnt lead her on
just a little
i mean a pretty girl
it would be normal
i didnt do a damn thing
maybe she thinks she can make the jump from assistant to wife too
youre a big help
what are you going to do
report it to human resources
get her fired
i dont have a choice
id be very careful if i were you
what if she makes trouble and says you came on to her
erek gives ben a look
ben contd contd look
its not like you dont have a history of behavior here
whens the last time you had a female assistant on your desk
people are going to wonder
then i need to get my side on the record first
they look at each other
a beat making a joke wouldnt it be cheaper to just have her killed
derek frowns at him
a determined derek arrives and enters the offices of henry truman in charge of human resources
a secretary looks up from her desk
morning mister charles
is hank in
i need to talk to him
from the inner office derek
derek enters hanks office and closes the door
well its sort of a personal matter
i need to talk to you about one of the temps lisa sheridan
she worked your desk for awhile
about to confess listen hank this going to be a little awkward
if youre here to file a complaint about her performance save your breath
her agency called this morning and said she wouldnt be coming in any more
they already sent over a replacement
hiding is surprise she quit
they give a reason
did you have some kind of a problem with her
well i just thought she was unqualified sort of in over her head
but if she already quit
looks like she beat you to it
absorbing this yeah
i guess not
hows the new house
new house is great
a smile couldnt be better
tell beth i said hi
well have you and kathy over some night when were more settled
sounds like a plan
derek opens the door and exits
outside down the hall ben is waiting
he raises his hand for a high five
come on bro
thats good news
as his good luck sinks in looks that way doesnt it
not a bad little christmas present
derek happier now returns the high five
hrough the window we see derek beth and kyle under the tree unwrapping presents having a great time
for derek all troubles are forgotten
c derek at his desk in a good mood on the phone
how was your christmas
well you people invented it
you got the prospectus
look it over
i think its gonna be a happy new year for all of us
derek looks at the doorway where ben is standing
derek gives ben the thumbs up
ben beams and does a little victory dance
derek and beth come in dressed in tux and gown exhausted from a new years party
god its after three
thats the last time im going out on new years eve
next year well celebrate here at home
just you me and kyle
a you have mail ding comes from dereks home computer on the other side of the room
im just gonna check my e mail and come to bed
cant it wait
its already tomorrow in berlin
ganz was supposed to send me his approval
thats probably him
beth goes into the adjoining bathroom
with a yawn derek sits down at his computer and goes to e mail
he scans it and is instantly confused
dozens of e mails all from the same sender tempgirl
little fearful derek pulls up the first e mail
it opens up to reveal a self taken photo of lisa looking sexy and inviting on a bed smiling seductively and wearing skimpy lingerie that shows off her sexy body
nder her photo see you in the new year
derek feels a jolt of panic
he deletes it brings up the others
ts the same photo lisa on the bed over and over
derek stares at lisa on screen feeling sick and invaded
he isnt aware of beth coming out of the bathroom behind him
she approaches as he continues to delete
shes about to peer over his shoulder
derek hits the delete key and the last photo of lisa disappears
beth contd what was that
acting perturbed nothing
i gotta get a new spam blocker
beth gives him a kiss on the cheek
hell call you in the morning
come to bed
beth goes away
erek stares at the computer screen saver a picture of beth with kyle sitting on santas knee at the grove
derek is at his desk tensely typing on the computer sending an e mail to tempgirl
derek types leave me alone
he sends it and sits back
almost instantly theres a reply
then tentatively he opens the new e mail
tempgirl has replied with one of those annoying yellow smiley faces
it winks at him
derek is chilled
the withered christmas tree waits at the curb for pick up
beth helps derek pack a bag
remember the last time joe had one of his weekend work retreats
how could i forget
i had a hangover for a week after
any women coming this year
no just the usual suspects
joe says its going to be a male bonding experience
i can just picture you guys in the hotel jacuzzi getting in touch with your innermost feelings
zips up his bag hopefully theyll all get drunk and crash early
or if im really lucky
drown in the jacuzzi
call me tonight
erek gives her a kiss
their image is reflected in the overhead mirror
a cocktail waitress delivers drinks to derek joe gage ben talbot and three other men smoking cigars and relaxing after dinner
the mood is rowdy
theyre all a little toasted
a drink is put in front of derek
i didnt order this
the cocktail waitress leans down and whispers in his ear its from the lady at the bar
erek turns and peers at the crowded bar area
he catches a flash of a young woman in a tight dress seated on a stool
but a crowd of people move into his line of vision and when they clear the woman is gone
derek you okay
just thought i saw somebody
somebody you know
or somebody youd like to know
the other guys chortle
you cant tempt this guy
who could blame him with a wife like beth
speaking of beth i said id give her a call before she puts kyle to bed
ill be right back
derek picks up his drink and leaves
this partys just getting started
derek comes out flips open his cell to call home
he puts his drink down on a table
intercutting with beth in kyles bedroom putting him to sleep
hows the male bonding
theyre all getting wasted
any minute now joes going to suggest the jacuzzi
well if your future depends on putting on a bathing suit and hot tubbing it with a bunch of drunks
across the patio he sees a figure slowly approaching
its a woman back lit a silhouette
but as she passes into the light from the bar shes revealed as lisa transformed into an alluring femme fatale
i have to go
kyle wants to say good night
theyre yelling for me to come back
itll just take a second
beth picks up kyle
beth contd say good night to daddy
as lisa comes closer
beth ill call you later
ill be in bed derek
derek clicks off and pockets his cell
on the other end beth looks perturbed
now lisa comes face to face with derek smiling
she boldly picks up his drink and takes a sip
i can always tell from the pained look on your face when youre talking to beth
how did you know id be here
ive got my sources
slight frown whats wrong
you dont look happy to see me
why did you come here
you said you could never be with someone you work with
when he doesnt seem to get thats why i quit
so we could be together
derek looks at her astounded
holding down panic lisa you need to leave
teasing smile or what
youll make a scene
lisa contd call security
what would joe and ben and the others think
ill tell you what theyd think
theyd think we arranged it
and in a way we did
lisa turns aside
out of dereks sight she slips a capsule into his drink then puts it back on the table
lisa contd this hook up was on the books from the day we met
what are you talking about
one of us has to take control and i guess its me
so you go back say your good nights to the boys and ill be waiting in my room
im not coming to your room
would you rather i came to yours
you need help
i need help
moves closer seductive help me derek
she presses against him
stay away from me
lisa emits a musical little laugh and smooths her dress
she registers dereks angry face and clenched fists
all right derek
you play your games
turning away and ill play mine
lisa disappears into the darkness high heels echoing
derek feel his cell phone vibrate
he pulls it out
beth im sorry
where the hell are you bro
im right here
coming back in
agitated derek picks up his drink downs it and re enters the bar
erek and ben get off the elevator
ben is slightly drunk but derek is farther gone wobbly on his feet bleary
come on its early
well go to my room and plunder the mini bar charge it all to joe
d cant man
that last drink totally kicked my ass
i need to lie down
all right be that way
but dont forget
nine oclock in the california room
joes big rah rah to the troops
ben goes one way derek the other
derek feeling more and more disoriented makes his way to his room
he fishes around in his pockets and finds his key card
he slides it and pushes open the door
derek lets himself in doesnt even click on the lights
theres enough moonlight coming through the window to lead him to the bed where he flops down on his back
he doesnt even bother to undress
derek closes his eyes then opens them
he feels sick
sound and perception are playing games with his head
the room begins to spin and he can hear a sound a rushing noise
is it the shower in the bathroom
the bathroom door is shut but theres a crack of light around the edges
is someone in there
derek is too out of it to care
he just wants to sleep make it go away
he closes his eyes begins to drift off
the bathroom door opens letting in a cloud of steam and a shaft of light
a womans silhouette appears naked
she moves to the bed
erek feels the bed move
feels a tug on his trousers
then an amplified zzzziiippp
dereks eyes open in shock
he cant believe what he sees lisa naked straddling him
her hand caressing his face
its like a dream
lisa smiles seductively and puts a finger to her lips
groggy can barely get the word out no
her voice seems distorted like its coming from another world
lisa contd im going to take real good care of you
derek tries to resist but finds he has no control over his body or mind
all he can see is a shifting distorted image of lisas face
the blazing look of sexual desire in her eyes
and somewhere in those eyes he can see himself
and thats the last thing derek sees before he passes out and the entire world goes black and silent
c dazzling sunlight
derek wakes up startled by a pounding on the door
derek blinks blinded by the sun
his brain is fogged and hes disoriented
it takes him a moment to realize where he is
a hotel room
naked under the covers
how did he
womans voice contd housekeeping
the door begins to open
come back later
i come back
the door closes
erek glances over at the clock
hes overslept and now hes late for the seminar
derek starts to get up looks over and his heart stops
theres lisa sprawled beside him on her stomach naked under the covers
she opens her eyes and gives him a sexy sleepy smile stretching her body like a cat
derek goes into panic mode jumping out of the bed like its on fire
youve got to get out of here
what are you talking about
youve got to go
derek grabs lisa by the arm drags her out of the bed at the same time gathering her clothes from the floor and thrusting them into her arms
derek come on
i want you out of here
you worried somebodys gonna catch us
just get the hell out
we woke up a little grumpy this morning didnt we
lisa barely manages to slip into her dress before derek opens the door and pushes her out into the hall
isa contd derek what is wrong with you
derek slams the door
on the other side we hear lisas musical laugh
lisa contd all right
have it your way
derek locks the door
shaking he goes to the bed sits on the edge and buries his throbbing head in his hands
in hell fuck
derek slips in and takes a seat next to ben at the end of a big table
the other guys are there also a little under the weather
they take notice of his late arrival
interrupting his talk thank god
we were about to send out a search party
derek glances over at ben who frowns at him
derek looks over at the wall clock as joe resumes talking
while joe continues his talk a hotel clerk quietly slips into the room goes over to derek and whispers to him
derek perks up with concern
he leans over to ben derek contd its beth
what about her
ill be right back
derek gets up and leaves
derek follows the clerk
as they turn a corner
heres your wife sir
derek stops dead
its not beth waiting for him
its lisa dressed sexy casual bright smile
the clerk goes away
i thought you might need an excuse to get out of there
how about some lunch
its gorgeous outside and i made a reservation at derek grabs her by the elbow and hustles her out of sight trying to keep his voice down
what do you think this is
the morning after
we didnt do anything last night
lisa gives him a sly smile
but you cant remember can you
it didnt happen
derek not so loud
youll cause a scene
thats exactly what we right
derek hauls her roughly back down the hall
what are you doing
what i should have done last night
taking you inside to tell joe and the others whatever you want
theyll know youre out of your mind
e yanks her toward the door
trying to pull away why are you trying to ruin this
dont say that
derek throws her roughly against the wall
she hits her head a little stunned
derek steps back surprised by his own violence
derek contd im sorry
whats wrong with you
youre acting like a stranger
thats exactly what i am
a stranger a person you dont know
now either go inside and tell them your bullshit lies or get the hell out of here
flaring ugly tone you think you can use me then throw me away
im not some piece of garbage derek
im a human being
lisa reaches out to him
derek in frustration raises his hand as if to strike her
her eyes flash with excitement
derek stops himself revolted by his own behavior
lisa contd do it
you can do anything you want to me
dont you know that
derek stares at her like shes a thing an object
he shakes his head
isa contd dont look at me that way
how else do you look at somebody who sickens and repulses you
i dont care what you do or what you say
what goes on in that twisted mind of yours
it doesnt matter because the truth is theres never going to be anything between us
so go ahead lisa
do your worst
they stare at each other
then derek turns and goes into the seminar room closing the door behind him
with a heartbreaking expression of hurt lisa stares at the door for a long moment wipes a tear from her face and walks away
derek ben joe and the others eat dinner
a lively atmosphere
derek seems apart from the others lost in thought
derek you drinking
not tonight man
im sticking to ice tea
derek gets off on his floor and heads to his room
derek steps inside and freezes confronted with his worst nightmare
high heels and a path of discarded clothing leads to the bed where lisa lies in bed naked under the covers her eyes shut seemingly asleep
anger rising no
no fucking way
derek moves toward the bed and the sleeping girl
erek contd goddamn it lisa
her head is cocked to one side and her skin is ghostly pale
derek leans over and shakes lisas naked shoulder
derek contd lisa get up
its like shaking a doll
derek contd get up or ill drag you out and throw you in the hall
thats when derek sees it
on the night stand an empty bottle of prescription pills
derek picks up the bottle and looks at the label ambien
derek grabs the bedside phone and punches desk
derek contd fighting panic this is
theres a woman in my room shes taken an overdose of prescription pills ambien
you need to get the paramedics and security up here right away
derek hangs up
now he puts one knee on the bed and takes lisas face in his hands turning her head
he might as well be handling a marionette
derek contd lisa
he puts his ear to her naked chest trying to detect a heartbeat
if there is one he cant hear it
derek gently slaps her cheeks
rolls back her eye lids
derek contd oh god
now derek begins to perform cpr
he tilts lisas jaw back clears her mouth and begins to breathe into her alternating chest compressions
erek contd lisa
wake up goddamn it
c in a corner derek looks haggard being interviewed by a veteran police detective monica reyes
reyes looks more like a middle aged suburban mom than a cop but shes very good at her job
all right mister charles let me get this straight
reyes contd this girl you barely know works in your office fantasizes youre having an affair and when you reject her she tries to commit suicide in your bed
i know how it sounds but yeah thats pretty much it
there was no affair
so she just
made it up in her head
with no help from you
maybe i was too nice to her said something she took the wrong way i dont know
all i know is i did not lead her on
and you had no idea shed be at the hotel
i dont even know how she got in my room
apparently she told one of the housekeepers she was your wife and lost her key
doesnt that prove she did this on her own
all it proves is she lost her key
she never had a key
look mister charles i dont care if you were or werent banging this girl
i just need to get your version for my report
reyes contd besides if its a question of innocence im not the one you have to convince
what do you mean
lets just say i wouldnt like to explain a situation like this to my husband
before derek can respond reyes sees an er doctor signalling
reyes contd ill be right back
reyes goes to talk to the doctor
derek watches them talk
the doctor hands reyes a piece of paper
derek cant stand the suspense
he walks over and interrupts
how is she
reyes nods to the doctor and takes derek aside
they pumped her out in time
doctor says shes groggy and disoriented
probably tomorrow theyll move her out of icu and up to the fifth floor for a psychiatric evaluation
all suicides are put on hour hold its standard
did she say anything
as a matter of fact she was lucid long enough to give the doctor a name to call in case of emergency
he wrote it down
reyes hands derek a piece of paper
written on it is derek charles and his phone number
reyes contd still want to stick to your story
dawn is breaking as derek guides the yukon into the drive
he steps out hesitates
the front door of the house opens to reveal a very tense looking beth in a robe
they look at each other across the distance
derek walks to her
a little cold tell me everything
from the beginning
this is not going to be easy
erek has told it all
beth looking stunned stares at him uncomprehending
a long beat then
how could you let this happen
you think i encouraged it
maybe you liked it
what man wouldnt
the attentions of a pretty young girl
i can just see those adoring blue eyes batting at you every time you told her how pretty she looked or what a nice dress stop it beth
you know i never said those things
you must have said something
done something to give her the idea
if i did it wasnt intentional
she was in your bed derek
you spent the night together and you want me to believe nothing happened
i was passed out
damn you derek
beth turns away her face burning
i love you beth
i love kyle and the life we have together
i would never do anything to screw that up
this girl is disturbed
shes seriously disturbed and for some reason she fixated on me
i dont know
you should have told me
from the very beginning you should have told me
why didnt you
at first i thought it was no big deal
i was just embarrassed
i didnt know how to explain it to you without looking
i said i was wrong
did she know about us derek
how we met
dont do this beth
youll make yourself sick
im already sick
honey i know i screwed up
derek reaches out
derek contd but ive told you the truth
i have to know you believe me
weary sigh i dont know what to believe
all i know is i need to be alone for awhile
beth dont i need to be alone beth moves quickly upstairs
leaving derek there
he sits back on the couch head in his hands
at a loss
after a beat derek makes a determined rush up after her
only to find the bedroom door locked
resigned he makes his way over to he grabs a pillow
punches it twice
knows hes in the dog lisa is propped up in a hospital bed a dark brooding expression on her face tangled hair hanging down
just staring eyes wide a little dopey looking
monica reyes appears in the doorway
im monica reyes
isa looks up
her face transforms into a bright smile
im sorry im such a mess but they wont let me take a shower or wash my hair
dismissive laugh apparently im still on suicide watch
im a police officer assigned to your case
how are you feeling
well still a bit groggy from the medication
but it isnt stopping me from feeling ashamed for all the trouble ive caused
do you feel like talking about the other night
have you spoken to derek
and hes all right
when can i see him
im afraid thats not possible
miss sheridan i dont think mister charles wants to speak to you or continue any kind of contact
lisa looks at her oddly
then why did he send these
lisa indicates a bouquet of flowers in a vase nearby
keeping the surprise out of her voice he sent you flowers
reyes inspects the attached card
lisa darling the other night was just a misunderstanding
dont ever leave me
love always derek
when did these show up
a few hours ago
theyre lovely arent they
eyes decides not to push it goes into her q a can you tell me what happened at the hotel why you were there
didnt derek tell you
id like to hear your version
theres not a lot to tell
we got together at the hotel and you can guess what we did
derek denies it
hes just being a gentleman trying to protect me
the next day when derek told me his wife wouldnt give him a divorce and that we could never see each other again i guess i over reacted
i didnt realize he was just being noble
he was thinking about his little boy kyle
what the breakup might do to him
hes not even two you know
my parents broke up when i was pretty young
it leaves a scar that never really heals
so you believe mister charles is in love with you
l read the card
derek and i belong together and nothing can change that
but i do feel bad about his wife
im not a home wrecker
im not stealing him away
their marriage is dead and beth is in denial
it cant be easy to find out that the man she loves is in love with another woman
i just hope she doesnt do something foolish
strange smile you know the old saying
hell hath no fury like a woman scorned
lisa could almost be talking about herself
reyes nods but shes chilled
you take it easy now
well talk again
she excuses herself
lisa goes back to happily smiling at her flowers
derek and joe gage
i dont have to tell you how an incident like this could impact the company
even the slightest whiff of impropriety
there was no impropriety joe
this is just the sick fantasy of a very disturbed girl
who might retaliate by hitting us with a sexual harassment lawsuit
there was no sexual harassment
if anything im the one who was sexually harassed
i cant believe this is happening to me
its like a nightmare
by now youre probably wishing you had fucked her
erek gives him a shocked look
oe contd for all the trouble its costing you
goddamit joe if theres an injured party here its me
derek calm down
i believe you and you know ill back you up all the way
but if i find out there was something going on i wont have a choice
thats not going to happen because theres nothing to find out
then you have nothing to worry about
meantime im going to put ben on the ganz account
but ganz is my client look maybe you should take some time off
just til this blows over
marge sticks her head in
sorry to interrupt
derek theres a detective reyes here to see you
joe and derek exchange looks
derek and monica reyes face each other across dereks desk
she obviously ordered the flowers for herself
with your credit card
my secretary keeps all my personal information on her computer
lisa must have accessed it when she was working my desk
reyes gives him a blank look
derek contd you think i sent the flowers
id have to be as crazy as she is
reyes opens a bag
this is a print out of lisas blog
its sort of a diary she was keeping
reyes puts a large pile of papers on dereks desk
reyes contd its a rather graphic and detailed account of your various sexual liaisons together
you can read them for yourself but i should warn you theyre a little
derek pages through growing more alarmed
we see thing like this is
none of this ever happened
i was never at her apartment
i never even touched her let alone did any of this
according to those entries youre quite the accomplished lover mister charles
and you made promises to her promises to divorce your wife and marry her
you cant possibly believe this
whether i believe it or not is irrelevant
the only thing that matters is that she believes it
theres got to be something i can do to protect myself
you could file a restraining order
but that may not be necessary
lisas left town
she was released in the custody of an older sister yesterday
her sister flew down from san francisco and took her back
lisas agreed to check herself into a neuropsychiatric hospital up there
some relief well i cant say im unhappy to hear shes gone
maybe now she can get the help she needs
ith any luck mister charles youll never hear from her again
beth moves through the room stopping to pick up one of kyles toys
she looks through the sliding glass window and sees derek on the deck holding kyle in his arms
theyre playing a game
derek points to objects in the distance and kyle identifies them
and so on
a tear in beths eye
she comes closer
they dont see her
singing to kyle four little ducks went out one day
over the hill and far away
a few days later
a year old baby sitter samantha walks beth and derek to the front door
theyre dressed for a night out
youve got our cell numbers so if theres any problem dont hesitate to call us okay
come on honey
samantha knows what to do dont you
ive got four little brothers
im really good at this
ut beth remains concerned
to derek i dont know
maybe we should

come on we agreed
this is an important night
and i am not gonna waste you in that outfit
to samantha she looks fantastic doesnt she
like a movie star
erek takes beth by the arm
everythings gonna be fine
giving in to samantha okay but you call us
derek grins and leads her out the door calls back to samantha
well be back by ten
samantha closes the door behind them and locks it
derek and beth sit together in a romantic candle lit booth working on a bottle of wine
i havent seen you looking this relaxed and beautiful in weeks
id forgotten what this was like
the two of us out together
its been awhile
he looks at her
its been awhile since theyve touched or had sex too
beth smiles a little shyly drops her eyes
derek contd so

i need you to believe me
derek pours the last of the bottle into beths glass and signals the waiter
derek contd could we get another bottle please
derek smiles at beth
she looks at her wine glass
derek not everybody gets drunk and does things they regret
derek looks like hes been punched in the face
i keep telling you i didnt do any thing to regret
beth looks up and gives him a hard cold look
i am telling you
amantha is sprawled on the couch
the tv is going shes listening to music on her i pod while texting a friend on her phone and paging through a teen magazine all at the same time
she doesnt hear the door bell ring the first time
or the second
then theres a loud knocking
samantha becomes aware looks around then sees a shadowy figure through the frosted window next to the door
with a sigh of annoyance samantha gets up and goes to the door
she unlocks and opens it
lisa is standing on the threshold looking fresh and pretty and smiling
super friendly hi im beths friend allie
shes expecting me
lisa breezes right in
mister and mrs
charles are out
they went to dinner
beth told me to drop by

to samantha holding out the oh wait

samantha shakes her head no
lisa contd into cell beth ill call you tomorrow
lisa clicks off
lisa contd to samantha great
this will only take me a minute
lisa crosses to the stairs and goes up
samantha returns to the couch and resumes texting
yle is asleep in his crib
the door cracks open emitting light from the hall turning lisa into a silhouette
she enters the room silent as a ghost and approaches kyles crib
she stands over him smiling down at the vulnerable sleeping child
then lisa turns away and looks at herself in a mirror
she takes out a tube of red lipstick and applies it to her lips
samantha is listening to i pod music texting watching tv
in the background out of focus lisa comes down the stairs
nice meeting you
preoccupied doesnt even you too
samantha sends a last message then thinks she ought to check on the baby
she gets up starts for the stairs when she gets another text message on her phone
she checks it laughs and returns to the couch to text her friend back
c derek and beth drive home in tense silence
finally beth speaks
its his birthday tomorrow
i told him wed take him to legoland
ill go on line tonight and order the tickets
unless you think you should take him alone
whatever were going through he needs us to be together
derek turns the corner to their street
the house comes into sight
the garage door goes up
derek pulls into the drive and guides the car into the garage
a key in the lock
the door opens
derek and beth enter
on the couch samantha ends her texting and greets them with a bright smile
you guys got back so fast any trouble with kyle
he was a doll
but you just missed your friend
beth and derek freeze turn and look at each other
she was just here
called you on the cell
nobody called me
someone was here
inside the house
to beth you said it was okay
she said she had something for kyle
instant panic oh my god
in his crib
beth streaks for the stairs
how long since she was here
a couple minutes
derek runs for the stairs
samantha contd calling after them now you said it was okay
beth runs to the crib
to her horror its empty
lisa lets out a cry of anguish
derek appears in the door
lisa turns to him in desperate panic
she took him
she took my baby
derek tears back down the stairs shouting to samantha
he bursts out the front door
derek races into the garage yanks open the drivers door and gets in
he starts the engine turns to back out and surprise
theres kyle is in the backseat strapped into his car seat smiling at his daddy
derek gets out pulls open the back door and unstraps his son then hesitates
what derek sees makes his blood run cold
on the childs forehead
a perfect red lipstick kiss
kyle is being examined by a doctor while derek and beth comfort him
we pumped his stomach
x ray and cat scan came back normal
well wait for the blood work but it appears hes completely fine
i dont see any reason why you cant take bhim home in a couple hours
tearful relief thank you doctor
monica reyes appears in the doorway
erek and beth confer with reyes
beth is very agitated
apparently lisa stole her sisters id to buy a ticket and board a plane to la earlier today then used her sisters credit card to rent a car
the sister didnt even know she was gone until a few hours ago
she said lisa had been doing well in therapy
she didnt know she checked herself out this morning
she was in our house alone with our son
he doctor says hes fine
well im not fine
to reyes demanding i want you to find her
she violated the restraining order so we can arrest her
charles i know youre upset
im a mother too
how would you feel if it was your child
exactly the same as you
beth goes back into the examining room to join kyle
am i supposed to go out and buy a gun or something
she didnt physically harm him
no but she could have
is that the message shes trying to send
either that or
maybe she was trying to show you she could love him
off dereks sickened reaction people like lisa
their emotions can turn on a dime
what you dont want is her feelings for you to change to rage
i dont know
but theres a good chance shell try to get in touch
if she does you need to call me right away
meanwhile you might want to beef up your home security
the suv pulls up and parks
derek and beth get out
derek removes the sleeping kyle from his car seat and carries him to the front door where beth waits
kyle is asleep as derek tucks him in
beth cries out from another part of the house
derek races out of the room
the bedroom has been trashed
the bed has been stripped
the ceiling mirror is now a spider webs of cracks
the closet is open and clothes are strewn about
derek discovers beth on her knees holding up a family photograph in which beths head has been torn off
she never left
she was here the whole time
beth scrambles over and finds a wedding photo of herself and derek
again her head has been removed
eth contd what kind of sick person
derek crouches down and holds beth who begins to cry her body shaking
its all right its all right
its not all right
we have to do something
we cant live like this
as he holds his wife derek looks up and sees their reflection in the mirror twisted and distorted like lisas mind
derek and kyle watch baby einstein on tv
in the b
a security man installs a new alarm system
beth is on the phone talking to someone
derek keeps an eye on her
into phone right
beth clicks off starts dialing a new number
who are you calling

beth clicks off gives derek a defiant look
derek doesnt know what to say
the security man appears
youre all set folks
you want me to show you how the system works
derek lies in bed wide awake on guard
he hears a car engine outside gets up and goes to the window
derek looks out and sees a police patrol car in front of the house
a moment later it drives off
derek goes to kyles room
hes sleeping safely
he goes to the master bedroom and observes beth from the door way
derek returns to the guest room
a sudden sound
he hops up and goes to the window
its just the sprinklers going on in the front yard
derek is leaving for work
he points to the security pad
make sure you set this
you dont have to tell me
it cant go on much longer
theyre bound to pick her up soon
look if you want me to stay ill call in
go to work
if anything happens the security patrol can be here in two minutes
off his look go

derek opens the door and exits
beth closes it behind him then touches the keypad
beth watches from the window as derek drives off to work
kyle is nearby playing
the phone rings
beth goes over and picks it up a little wary
oh hi dad
as she listens with mounting concern we
patrick is at his desk
the phone buzzes and he picks up
derek charles office
oh hi beth
patrick perks up at the tone in beths voice
derek is concentrating at his desk when his phone buzzes
he answers quickly
kyle is playing on the floor
beth is on the phone

beth clicks off and turns to kyle
beth contd come on sweetie

beth almost laughs
she holds him close

kyle toddles over to his toy box
at his desk patrick answers the phone
derek charles office

her mother is having some tests done
derek is driving down first thing in the morning to be by her side
when she doesnt respond lisa

i wanted to tell you about my date i last night
the one my friend set me up with
the graphic artist
lisa youd be so proud of me
i met him for drinks at patrick
i really dont care whose dick you sucked last night
i have to go
the line goes dead
poor patrick looks like hes been hit in the face with a bag of shit
she puts her cell phone in her pocket
iden to reveal that shes standing in a grove of trees looking down at the charles house
beth goes out the front door arms full with kyle and overnight bags
she sets the alarm and shuts the door behind her
only to realize she forgot her purse
beth punches back in grabs the purse from inside and closes the front door again behind her
forgets to re set the alarm
beth secures kyle in his kiddie seat then walks around to the drivers side gets in and drives away
pan up to lisa watching
lisa approaches the back of the house carrying a paper bag
she steps up on the deck and goes to the kitchen door
she doesnt even check to see if its locked
she takes the bag which contains a bottle of champagne and uses the bottle to break a pane in the kitchen door window
then she reaches inside and unlocks the door
lisa steps inside and looks around at the cheerful room kyles high chair the places set for three at the table
isa puts the champagne bottle on the counter then humming happily she begins to open shelves until she finds two crystal champagne flutes
she takes them down
now she looks for an ice bucket and finds it
beth drives down the hill calling derek on her cell
answering his cell hey
we just left the house
did you set the alarm
i think i did
i had to run back in and i cant remember if i re set it
look dont worry about it
no im barely down the hill
ill do it and call you back
beth clicks off
she slows down and pulls into a driveway
she backs out and returns up the hill
lisa enters carrying the ice bucket with the champagne bottle in it and the two flutes
she smiles excitedly like a woman preparing for her lovers return
lisa places the champagne on the night table
she removes her coat to reveal a sexy white nightgown then reaches into the coat pocket and takes out a paper bag
he upends the bag and with a giggle begins to sprinkle red rose petals on the floor making a trail to the bed
beth drives up the winding road to the house
the ice bucket and champagne sit on the night table
lisa stretches out on the bed amid the rose petals leaving a space for her lover beside her
she gazes up at the cracked ceiling mirror
she smiles at herself and thanks to the cracked mirror her smile is distorted scary and insane looking
beth pulls into the drive
on the bed lisa hears the car
she rolls off the bed and crosses to the window parting the curtains to look out
beth stepping out of the car
barely audible to kyle mommy will just be a minute
lisa tenses suddenly fearful
he cant work glancing at his cell for beths call
beth lets herself in
shes about to set the alarm when she hears the floor creak above her
she waits listens
no further sound
but beth knows
beth goes to the front door as if to leave
she opens the door and closes it as if she left the house
lisa standing very still near the window hears the sound of the door opening downstairs then closing
relieved she moves to the window and peers out expecting to see beth getting into the car
but theres no sight of her
beth pulls off her shoes and lays them by the door
she begins to quietly tip toe up the stairs certain to be as quiet as she can
beth enters to see lisa peering out the window
girl youre even dumber than my husband said you were
or did you just forget to take your meds
lisa whirls around
beth is standing in the doorway giving lisa a deadly look like a cat whos just trapped a mouse
beth takes notice of the rose petals on the bed and floor
lisa is wide eyed terrified caught
lisa begins to edge her way around the room
beth contd you really fucked up this time
coming back to my house
didnt you get my message
lisas eyes dart around for escape
beth seems remarkably calm
beth contd you can look all you want but youre not getting out of here
ot until ive given you the beating of your life
and she means it too
lisa tries to dart around her
but beth cuts her off grabbing lisa by the throat and forcing her back slamming her hard against the bed post
isa bounces off the post stunned
beth is on her slapping her hard grabbing a handful of lisas hair ripping it out by the roots as lisa tries to get free
lisa lets out a subhuman shriek of pain
beth tosses the hank of hair aside keeps on coming
shes beyond pissed
beth contd think you can walk into my house
beth slaps and punches lisa
beth contd my child
lisa tries to fight back but beth is a tiger beating the hell out of her knocking her around the room
in pain terrified please
please dont hurt you
as beth pummels her lisa stumbles retreats into the adjoining bathroom
she slams the door shut and throws the lock face bleeding looking around for a weapon something to protect herself with
the bathroom door comes off its hinges as beth barges in
beth grabs lisa by the head and slams her face into the bathroom mirror
lisa is wobbly unable to stand
her face is a bloody mess
but before she can collapse beth props her up
we need to wash that off
beth forces lisa down shoves her head into the toilet and flushes it holding her there as lisa flops and chokes
beth contd dont worry
im not going to drown you
jerking lisas head up no no
im just getting started
too late bitch
sorry wont cut it
beth kicks lisa out of the bathroom
lisa lands on the floor and gets up rose petals sticking to her gown
as beth comes out of the bathroom lisa lunges for the night table and grabs the bottle of champagne
she swings it and hits beth is the side of the head
the cork pops and champagne goes spewing everywhere
stunned beth goes down on her knees
lisa wipes blood from her face circling beth lips drawn back and teeth showing like an animal
he doesnt love you
im the one he wants
crazed screaming why cant you get that through your head
lisa raises the bottle to hit her again
beth lunges forward and tackles her
the bottle goes flying as the two women thrash around on the floor
derek dials beths cell
kyle snoozes in his car seat
inside beths hand bag on the front seat her cell phone trills
beth and lisa fight on the floor like two she demons
lisa breaks free from beth
she crawls to the head of the stairs and grabs the post pulling herself to her feet eager to escape
suddenly behind her careful
you dont want to fall down the stairs
beth gives lisa a shove
lisa goes crashing down the stairs and lands at the bottom in a heap
beth contd did that hurt
because it looked real painful
managing to sit up defensive please
oh its beth now
what happened to betty
lisa rises to her feet wobbly
she raises bloody hands in surrender
i swear ill never bother you again
you got that right
lisa turns and desperately hobbles for the front door
but beth easily beats her to it knocking lisa aside and throwing the chain
eth turns and faces lisa with a murderous look
hugging the wall for support lisa back away leaving a bloody smear
in the kitchen the phone rings
both women freeze
hone rings again
hi youve reached the charles residence
were not here right now but if you have a message for derek
kyle say hello
please wait for the beep
with concern beth
are you there
lisa tries to make it to the kitchen to get the phone
beth grabs her by the sleeve and pulls her back
the sleeve tears loose in beths hand
lisa stumbles back toward the stairs
she scrambles upward thinking maybe she can get to the phone in the bedroom
lisa reaches the top step just as beth snags her ankle stopping her
lisa rolls around and viciously kicks beth in the shoulder with her other leg
beth falls back tumbles halfway down the stairs
ereks voice contd beth pick up
lisa makes it to the bedroom
she sees the phone on the night stand
dereks voice contd beth
are you there
lisa desperately grabs the phone
oh derek thank god
reacting in surprise and panic
before she can answer beth is suddenly there
she rips the phone from lisas hand and strikes her with it
as lisa stumbles back into the hall landing beth speaks calmly even sweetly into the receiver
derek im right in the middle of something
let me call you back
beth beth hangs up the phone
alarmed derek hurries out of the office punching a number into his cell as he runs to the elevator
a nervous patrick watches derek exit
erek contd i need to speak to lt
its an emergency
beth goes out into the hall and lisa springs on her
he two women fight going up against the bannister
they claw and punch at each other
with renewed strength lisa forces beth up against the bannister
beth looks over the side and down
fifteen feet below is that large glass dining table
lisa bangs beth against the bannister
a few feet away is a heavy crystal chandelier suspended from the ceiling by a metal chain
he bannister rail begins to crack
lisa tries to force beth over then beth suddenly swings them around reversing positions the bannister cracks breaks apart and lisa topples over the side
as shes about to fall lisa reaches out and grabs the chandelier with both hands
by a miracle it supports her and she swings back and forth like a human pendulum but now the chandelier is beginning to pull loose from its ceiling mount
plaster cracks and rips away
lisa swings back and forth dangling
beth stands on the landing
she looks at terrified lisa then up at the ceiling mount
it wont take lisas weight much longer
and both women know it
lisa hangs by one hand reaching out with her other hand to beth who could pull her to safety
then as if coming out of dream she slowly reaches out to lisa
their hands lock together
beth slowly pulls lisa toward her toward safety
quiet voice let go of the chandelier
let go lisa
he chandelier is about to break loose
eth contd motherly concern listen to me
you have to let go right now
and trusting lisa lets go
but so does beth
with a look of horror on her face lisa falls through space
the soundtrack goes dead silent as we go into slow motion
down down down lisa falls
her arms and legs flop around like a marionette with its strings cut clawing the air
the fall seems endless
lisa hits the glass dining table with her back
her whole body buckles
the surface of the table ripples
in slow mo the glass shatters and explodes around lisa framing her entire body forming a halo around her head
sound returns the sound of breaking glass and its deafening
the table gives way and lisa lands hard on the marble floor her skull cracking
her back is probably broken but shes still conscious
ying there lisa stares up at beth on the landing as glass bounces and tinkles around her
the two enemies lock eyes
beths face is impassive
lisa opens her mouth trying to speak
and thats when the chandelier breaks loose
beth watches without emotion as the chandelier plunges downward and hits lisa in the chest with a radiantly beautiful shower of crystals
it kills her on impact
e come out of slow motion
real time resumes
on the landing beth stares down at lisas body splayed under the chandelier like a broken doll
lisas eyes are open but theyre dead
beth stoic just stands there looking down
as derek speeds through traffic desperate to get home
beth comes down the stairs taking no notice of lisas lifeless body
she goes to the foyer unhooks the chain and opens the front door
outside a car pulls up and monica reyes jumps out
reyes hurries up the walk and meets beth standing in the open door
is everything alright here
very calm im fine
lisa had an accident
moving past reyes i have to go
my mother needs me
reyes looks into the house and sees lisas body then turns back as beth goes to her car and opens the drivers door
beth i need to speak with you
beth turns back to reyes
call me on my cell
what happened here
i think you know what happened
a beat ore
beth contd now my child has been waiting too long
i am sure my husband will be home soon
beth and reyes lock eyes
reyes nods her understanding
beth nods back gets in the car starts the engine and backs out of the drive
reyes watches her exit
he dials his cell
she picks up her ringing cell phone looks at the caller id and glances at kyle in the rearview mirror
tears start to well its daddy
beth i spoke to reyes
are you okay
its over derek beth
a pause tell me baby are you hurt
i should have believed you
its gonna be okay honey
were gonna be okay long beat i love you derek
and i love you derek continues on against the traffic
the dashboard picture of beth and kyle still smiling back at him
as beths car drives away passing police cars on their way to the house
