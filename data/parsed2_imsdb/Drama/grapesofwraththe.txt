b if window
href b b screenplay by nunnally johnson based on the novel the grapes of wrath by john steinbeck an oklahoma paved highway in daylight
at some distance hoofing down the highway comes tom joad
he wears a new stiff suit of clothes ill fitting and a stiff new cap which he gradually manages to break down into something comfortable
he comes down the left side of the road the better to watch the cars that pass him
as he approaches the scene changes to a roadside short order restaurant on the right side of the road
from it comes the sound of a phonograph playing a popular song
in front of the eatery is a huge diesel truck labeled oklahoma city transport company
the driver a heavy man with army breeches and high laced boots comes out of the restaurant the screen door slamming behind him
he is chewing on a toothpick
a waitress appears at the door behind the screen
when you be back
couple a weeks
dont do nothin you wouldnt want me to hear about
we see him climbing into the cab of the truck from the right side
getting behind the wheel he is releasing the handbrake when tom appears at the drivers seat window
how about a lift mister
cant you see that sticker
he indicates a no riders sticker on the windshield
sure i see it
but a good guy dont pay no attention to what some heel makes him stick on his truck
after a moment of hesitation the driver releases the brake
scrunch down on the running board till we get around the bend
as tom scrunches down on the running board the driver throws the truck into gear and it moves
the scene dissolves to the cab of the truck
it is day and tom is seated beside the driver who is surreptitiously eyeing him trying to confirm some suspicion an inspection which tom ignores at first
shaking his head just a few miles
id a walked her if my dogs wasnt pooped out
lookin for a job
no my old man got a place forty acres
hes a sharecropper but we been there a long time
after a curious glance oh
cautiously the drivers eyes drop to toms feet
we see toms shoes
they are prison shoes new stiff and bulky
curiosity is in the eyes of the driver as they shoot a swift glance at tom
tom is looking straight ahead with the dead pan look that prisoners get when they are trying to conceal something
the drivers eyes take in toms hands and the stiff coat
been doin a job
i seen your hands
you been swinging a pick or a sledge that shines up your hands
i notice little things like that all the time
after a pause got a trade
evenly why dont you get to it buddy
uneasily get to what
you know what i mean
you been givin me a goin over ever since i got in
whynt you go on and ask me where i been
i dont stick my nose in nobodys business
naw not much
a little frightened i stay in my own yard
without emotion listen
that big nose of yours been goin over me like a sheep in a vegetable patch
but i aint keepin it a secret
i been in the penitentiary
been there four years
like to know anything else
you aint got to get sore
coldly go ahead
ask me anything you want
i didnt mean nothing
im just tryin to get along without shovin anybody around thats all
after a pause see that road up ahead
thats where i get off
with a sigh of relief the driver puts his foot on the brake
the truck stops and tom gets out
he look at the uneasy driver contemptuously
youre about to bust to know what i done aint you
well i aint a guy to let you down
the driver throws the truck into gear
he doesnt like this at all
i never asked you
as the truck moves away sure but youd a throwed a fit if i hadnt tol you
he looks indifferently after the truck and then starts on foot down the dirt crossroad
a wind has begun to blow
the scene dissolves to the roadside under a willow tree in daylight
the wind is still blowing
sitting on the ground his back against the tree casy a long lean man in overalls blue shirt and one sneaker is fixing something on the other dirty sneaker
to the tune of yes sir thats my baby he is absent mindedly singing
mmmmm hes my saviour
mmmmm my saviour mmmmmmmmmm my saviour now
looking up as tom comes down the road howdy friend
carrying his coat under his arm tom wipes his face with his cap as he cuts off the road to acknowledge the greeting
he stops grateful for the momentary relief of the shade
say aint you young tom joad ol toms boy
on my way home now
well i do declare
grinning i baptized you son
staring why youre the preacher
used to be
not no more
i lost the call
reminiscently but boy i sure used to have it
id get an irrigation ditch so squirmin full of repented sinners i pretty near drowned half of em
sighing but not no more
i lost the sperit
with a grin pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher
i got nothin to preach about no more thats all
i aint so sure o things
maybe you should a got yourself a wife
shakes his head sadly at my meetins i used to get the girls glory shoutin till they about passed out
then id go to comfort em and always end up by lovin em
id feel bad an pray an pray but it didnt do no good
next time do it again
i figgered there just wasnt no hope for me
i never let one go by me when i could catch her
but you wasnt a preacher
a girl was just a girl to you
but to me they was holy vessels
i was savin their souls
fervently i ast myself what is this call the holy sperit
maybe thats love
why i love everybody so much im fit to bust sometimes
so maybe there aint no sin an there aint no virtue
theres just what people do
some things folks do is nice and some aint so nice
but thats as far as any mans got a right to say
after a moment figuring there is no percentage in continuing this philosophical discussion pulls out a flask which he extends have a little snort
holding the flask course ill say grace if somebody sets out the food shaking his head but my heart aint in it
he takes a long pull nice drinkin liquor
ought to be
thats factry liquor
cost me a buck
handing back the flask been out travelin around

no i never
i been in the penitentiary for four years

i dont mind any more
id do what i done again
i killed a guy at a dance
we was drunk
he got a knife in me and i laid him out with a shovel
knocked his head plumb to squash
and you aint ashamed
shaking his head he had a knife in me
thats why they only gave me seven years
got out in four parole
aint you seen your folks since then
putting on his coat no but i aim to before sundown
gettin kind of excited about it too
which way you going
putting on his sneaker it dont matter
ever since i lost the sperit it looks like i just as soon go one way as the other
rising ill go your way
they pause at the edge of the shade squint up at the sky and then move off
the scene dissolves to the surface of a dirt road by daylight
leaves are scuttling across it
the top soil begins to fly up
it is not a hard wind as yet but it is steady and persistent
toms and casys feet walk into sight
maybe mall have pork for supper
i aint had pork but four times in four years every christmas
ill be glad to see you pa
last time i seen him was at a baptizin an he had one a the bigges doses of the holy sperit i ever seen
he go to jumpin over bushes howlin like a dog wolf in moon time
finly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an he let out a squawk an took a run at that bush
well sir he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two
they was a travellin dentist there and he set her an i give her a prayin over but they wasnt no more holy sperit in your pa after that
this winds fixint to do somepin
shore it is
it always is this time a year
tom holding his cap on his head with his hand looks up
the tops of the trees are bending before the wind
tom and casy continue walking
is it fur
still looking back just around that next bend
tom and casy are almost being blown along and dust is rising from the road
lifting his voice above the wind your granma was a great one too
the third time she got religion she go it so powerful she knocked down a full growed deacon with her fist
pointing ahead thats our place
the joad cabin is an ancient bleak sway backed building
there is neither sign of life or habitation about it
looking back and it aint any too close either
we better run
a dust storm like a black wall rises into the sky moving forward
tom and casy are running but looking back over their shoulders as the dust storm nears
dust rises from the ground to join and thicken the black wall
tom and casy are seen racing down the road to the cabin the wind whipping up the dust
the two men smack open the door and slam it shut after them
the screen begins to grow dark as the storm sweeps over the land
it becomes black
in the cabin it is black too but the sound is different
in addition to the sound of the wind there is the soft hissing of sand against the house
aint nobody here
after a long silence somepins happened
you got a match
there was some pieces of candle always on a shelf
presently after shuffling about he has found them and lights one
he holds it up lighting the room
a couple of wooden boxes are on the floor a few miserable discarded things and thats all
toms eyes are bewildered
theyre all gone or dead
they never wrote you nothing
they wasnt people to write
from the floor he picks up a womans high button shoe curled up at the toe and broken over the instep
this was mas
had em for years
dropping the shoe he picks up a battered felt hat
this used to be mine
i give it to grampa when i went away
to casy you reckon they could be dead
i never heard nothin about it
dropping the hat he moves with the candle toward the door to the back the only other room of the cabin
he stands in the doorway holding the candle high
in the back room the scene moves from tom at the door across the room to the shadows where a skinny little man sits motionless wide eyed staring at tom
his name is muley
wheres my folks muley
dully they gone
irritated i know that
but where they gone
muley does not reply
he is looking up at casy as he enters
to casy this is muley graves
to muley you remember the preacher dont you
i aint no preacher anymore
impatiently all right you remember the man then
glad to see you again
glad to see you
angrily now where is my folks
gone hastily over to your uncle johns
the whole crowd of em two weeks ago
but they cant stay there either because johns got his notice to get off
bewildered but whats happened
how come they got to get off
we been here fifty years same place
everbody got to get off
everbody leavin goin to california
my folks your folks everbodys folks
after a pause everbody but me
i aint gettin off
but who done it
impatiently tom listens to the storm thats some of what done it the dusters
started it anyway
blowin like this year after year blowin the land away blowin the crops away blowin us away now
angrily are you crazy
simply some say i am
after a pause you want to hear what happened
thats what i asked you aint it
muley is seen at close range
not actually crazy muley is a little touched
his eyes rove upward as he listens to the sound of the storm the sough of the wind and the soft hiss of the sand
the way it happens the way it happened to me the man come one day
the scene dissolves to muleys dooryard
it is a soft spring day with the peaceful sounds of the country
seated in a three year old touring car is the man a city man with a collar and tie
he hates to do what he is doing and this makes him gruff and curt to hide his misgivings
squatted beside the car are muley his son in law and a half grown son
at a respectful distance stand muleys wife his daughter with a baby in her arms and a small barefooted girl watching worriedly
the men soberly trace marks on the ground with small sticks
a hound dog sniffs at the automobile wheels
fact of the matter muley after what them dusters done to the land the tenant system dont work no more
it dont even break even much less show a profit
one man on a tractor can handle twelve or fourteen of these places
you just pay him a wage and take all the crop
but we couldnt do on any lessn what our share is now
looking around the chillun aint gettin enough to eat as it is and theyre so ragged wed be shamed if everbody elses chillun wasnt the same way
irritably i cant help that
all i know is i got my orders
they told me to tell you you got to get off and thats what im telling you
muley stands in anger
the two younger men pattern after him
you mean get off my own land
now dont go blaming me
it aint my fault
whose fault is it
you know who owns the land the shawnee land and cattle company
whos the shawnee land and cattle compny
it aint nobody
its a company
they got a presdent aint they
they got somebody that knows what a shotguns for aint they
but it aint his fault because the bank tells him what to do
angrily all right
wheres the bank
but whats the use of picking on him
he aint anything but the manager and half crazy hisself trying to keep up with his orders from the east
bewildered then who do we shoot
stepping on the starter brother i dont know
if i did id tell you
but i just dont know whos to blame
angrily well im right here to tell you mister aint nobody going to push me off my land
grampa took up this land seventy years ago
my pa was born here
we was all born on it and some of us got killed on it and some died on it
and thats what makes it ourn bein born on it and workin it and dyin on it and not no piece of paper with writin on it
so just come on and try to push me off
the scene dissolves to the back room
the sound of the storm is heard again as tom and casy watch muley
without emotion they come
they come and pushed me off
we see muley at close range
they come with the cats
the cats the caterpillar tractors
the scene dissolves to a montage of tractors tractors looming over hillocks flattening fences through gullies their drivers looking like robots with goggles dust masks over mouth and nose one
after the other crossing and recrossing as if to convey the impression that this was an invasion of machine men from some other world
and for ever one of em ten fifteen families gets throwed outa their homes one hundred folks with no place to live but on the road
the rances the perrys the peterses the joadses one after another they got throwed out
half the folks you and me know throwed right out into the road
the one that got me come a month ago
the scene dissolves to muleys farm
we see the backs of muley and the two younger men standing shoulder to shoulder watching a lumbering tractor headed straight toward them
it is at some distance
muley holds a shotgun
his son has a baling hook
the son in law has a two by four
behind them is their cabin
frightened and huddled together are the women and children
the roar of the tractor comes closer
shouting you come any closer and im gonna blow you right outa that cat
he lifts his shotgun the tractor continues to lumber along its driver goggled and black of face where his dust mask doesnt cover
muley lifts his shotgun to his shoulder and aims
i tol you
the tractor stops
the driver takes off his goggles and dust mask
like the others hes a country boy
his face is sullen
muley is lowering his shotgun
there is a surprise in his face as he recognizes the driver
why youre joe daviss boy
he moves forward followed by his son and son in law in the tractor
davis is wiping his face as they walk toward him
i dont like nobody drawin a bead on me
then what are you doin this kind a thing for against your own people
for three dollars a day thats what im doin it for
i got two little kids
i got a wife and my wifes mother
them people got to eat
fust and ony thing i got to think about is my own folks
what happens to other folks is their lookout
but this is my land son
dont you understand
putting his goggles back on used to be your land
blongs to the compny now
we see the womenfolks
a small girl pulls her mothers dress
whats he fixin to do ma
back to the tractor and the men grimly have it your own way son but just as sure as you touch my house with that cat im gonna blow you
plumb to kingdom come
contemptuously you aint gonna blow nobody nowhere
first place youd get hung and you know it
for another it wouldnt be two days before theyd have another guy here to take my place
and the tractor roars into slow motion again
we see the house and tractor
the womenfolks scamper out of the way as the tractor heads for a corner of the house
it goes over a ramshackle fence and then a feeble little flower bed
muley and the two younger men walk along
breathing hard frightened and desperate muley is shouting warnings at davis but the roar of the tractor drowns his voice
the dog barks excitedly snarling at the tractor
the womenfolks stand watching terrified but dead pan until a cry bursts from muleys wife
the little girl begins to whimper
im tellin you
the tractor moves across the yard nosing a chair out of the way and with a rending of boards hits a corner of the house knocking a part of the
the corner of the house sinks
muley lifts his shotgun aims it holds it and then slowly lowers it
as he stands looking at what has happened his shoulders sag
he seems almost to shrink
the scene dissolves to muley once more in the back room of toms old home as the sound of the storm continues
dully what was the use
he was right
there wasnt a thing in the world i could do about it
bewildered but it dont seem possible kicked off like that
the rest of my fambly set out for the west there wasnt nothin to eat but i couldnt leave
somepin wouldnt let me
so now i just wander around
sleep wherever i am
i used to tell myself i was lookin out for things so when they come back everthing would be all right
but i knowed that want true
there aint nothin to look out for
and aint nobody comin back
theyre gone and me im just an ol graveyard ghost thats all in the world i am
tom rises in his agitation and bewilderment
you think im touched
youre lonely but you aint touched
it dont matter
if im touched im touched and thats all there is to it
still unable to grasp it all what i cant understand is my folks takin it
i seen her nearly beat a peddler to death with a live chicken
she aimed to go for him with an ax she had in the other hand but she got mixed up and forgot which hand was which and when she got
through with that peddler all she had left was two chicken legs
he looks down at muley
just a plain ol graveyard ghost thats all
his eyes are dull on the floor
the sound of the dust storm continues strongly
the scene dissolves to the exterior of the cabin at night
it is several hours later and the sound of the storm has faded out
now all is silence as first tom then casy and finally muley steps out of the cabin and looks around
there is still a slight fog of dust in the air and clouds of powderlike dust shoot up around their feet
all three men have wet rags tied over their mouths and noses
what you figger to do
its hard to say
stay here till mornin an then go on over to uncle johns i reckon
after that i dont know
grabbing tom listen
faint sound of motor thats them
come on we got to hide out
angrily hide out for what
we aint doin nothin
terrified youre trespassin
it aint you lan no more
an thats the suprtendant with a gun
come on tom
youre on parole
a car approaches at some distance the headlights moving up and down as the car rides a dirt road
a part of the cotton field muley leads the way
all you got to do is lay down an watch
as they lie down wont they come out here
snickering i dont think so
one come out here once an i clipped him from behin with a fence stake
they aint bothered since
the exterior of the cabin the car stops
a strong searchlight flashes on and goes over the cabin
in car muley
after a pause he aint here
the car moves on
tom casy and muley lie flat listening to the sound of the car going away
anybody ever tol me id be hidin out on my own place
he whistles as the scene fades out
dried cornstalks seen by daylight fade in
the cornstalks their roots blown clean and clear of the earth lie fallen in one direction
this is what has happened to farms that were once rich and green
then uncle johns cabin comes into view
it is just after sunup
the air is filled with country sounds a shrill chorus of birds a dog barking in the distance
the cabin is of the same general appearance as the joad cabin but even smaller
smoke curls from the chimney
we see a platter on a table inside the cabin
the platter is filled with sidemeat
over the scene comes ma joads voice
lord make us thankful for what we are about to receive for his sake
as she speaks a mans scrawny hand reaches forward and sneaks out a piece of sidemeat
five people are seated around the breakfast table on chairs or boxes
they are pa grampa granma noah and uncle john
two children ruthie and winfield stand to the table because there are no more chairs
their heads are all bent as ma standing with a fork in her hand between the table and the stove ends the grace
heads lift and there is a bustle as ma turns back to the frying pork on the stove and the others truck into their food
granma points a spiteful finger at grampa
i seen you
you et durin grace
indignantly one little ole dab
one teeny little ole dab
ruthie and winfield though they are shoveling it in are grinning at grampa
in a snickering whisper to winfield aint he messy though
viciously i seen him
gobblin away like an ole pig
whynt you keep your eyes shet durin grace you ole
noah is solemnly studying a handbill
over his shoulder the handbill can be read pickers wanted work in california we see noah and uncle john
who is a half wit whats it say again
says plenty work in california peaches
eight hundred pickers needed
noah frowns at the print
who has mush on his mouth waitll i get to california
gonna reach up and pick me an orange whenever i want it
that theres somethin i aint never had enough of
gonna get me a whole bunch a grapes off a bush and im gonna squash em all over my face and just let the juice dreen down offen my chin
in a feeble bleat puh raise the lawd for vittory
expanding maybe i get me a whole washtub fulla them grapes and jest sit in em and scrooge around till they was gone
sighing i shore would like to do that
ruthie and winfield are snickering
ruthie has smeared her face with mush
she pulls winfield around to see
she begins to slobber in mimicry
at that instant ma enters unobserved and without a word give ruthie a fine wallop
nobody else pays any attention to the slap as ma a bucket in her hand moves on toward the door
we see her now in the backyard first at the door then moving toward the well
she stops dead still her eyes gazing outward
tom is looking at the household goods piled around the yard to be taken to california
casy is in the background
then tom looks up and see ma out of the scene
his face softens
he moves toward her
softly her eyes closed thank god
oh thank god
in sudden terror as he approaches tommy you didnt bust out didya
you aint got to hide have you
i got my papers
with a sigh and a smile and her eyes full of wonder she feels his arm
her fingers touch his cheek as if she were blind
swelling with emotion tom bites his lip to control himself
i was so scared we was goin away without you and wed never see each other again
id a found you ma
casy with great politeness turns his back to the scene and keeps well away from it
tom now looks around at the dusty furniture piled around the yard
muley tol me what happened ma
are we goin to california true
we got to tommy
but thats gonna be awright
i seen the hanbills about how much work they is an high wages too
but i gotta fin out somepin else first tommy
breathlessly did they hurt you son
did they hurt you an make you mean mad
puzzled mad ma
sometimes they do
gently no ma i was at first but not no more
not yet quite convinced sometimes they do somethin to you tommy
they hurt you and you get mad and then you get mean and they hurt you again and you get meaner and meaner till you aint no boy or no
man any more but just a walkin chunk a mean mad
did they hurt you like that tommy
grinning no ma
you dont have to worry about that
i i dont want no mean son she loves him with her eyes at the door pa is staring toward them his mouth open
almost to himself its tommy
then shouting inside its tommy back
heading for tom whatd you do son bust out
inside uncle johns cabin all but granma are staring toward the door
then all but granma scramble to their feet headed for the door
in an excited chant toms outa ja ul
toms outa ja ul
i knowed it
couldnt keep him in
cant keep a joad in
i knowed it from the fust
the children and grampa scramble out first followed hurriedly but less rowdily by uncle john and noah
granma aware only that there is some excitement looks interestedly after them but decides against any activity
vaguely puh raise the lawd for vittory
she resumes eating in the backyard the prodigal son mother and father proudly beside him is having his hand wrung by grampa who vainly tries to button various buttons of
his shirt as always
the two children jump up and down excitedly but are too shy to force themselves into the reception
to pa you know what i alays said tomll come bustin outa that jail like a bull through a corral fence
cant keep no joad in jail
grinning i didnt bust out
they lemme out
howya uncle john
glad to see you
to anybody i was the same way myself
put me in jail and id bust right out
couldnt hold me
as tom chucks the two children under the chin the rattling roar of a jalopy causes all to turn to look
confidentially bust out
shaking his head parole
the roar increases
a home built truck comes around the corner of the house
once a hudson sedan the top has been cut in two and a truck body constructed
it is driven now by al and on the front seat with him are rosasharn and connie
the arrival as the truck moves into the yard increases the excitement and the scene is a little incoherent with the talking and shouting and the noise of the jalopy
surprised and pleased rosasharn
wildly the jailbirds back
the jailbirds back
to tom thats connie rivers with her
theyre married now
confidentially shes due about three four months
marveling why she wasnt no moren a kid when i went up
eagerly as he jumps down you bust outa jail tom
they paroled me
let down oh
proudly this is connie my husband
shaking hands if this dont beat all
chuckling well i see you been busy already
gasping you do not see either
at the whoop of laughter that goes up from all she turns in a fine simulation of maidenly mortification and throws herself into connies arms hiding her face against his
after a moment of surprise a slow happy fatuous grin begins to broaden his face
he beams whereupon their delight increases the men roaring and jeering and slapping their legs the women making modest efforts to suppress their amusement
lookut his face
ysee his face
yever see anything like her face when tom said it
look around rosasharn
lets see it again
an automobile horn sounds sharply
their laughter halted as though cut by a knife they look off
a touring car has stopped in the road by the house the engine still running
one man drives the other talks
in the backyard the people are silent their faces without expression as all gaze toward the touring car
aint forgot have you
we aint forgot
comin through here tomorrow you know
we be out
we be out by sunup
the touring cars engine is still heard after the men drive off
the joads watch the car their heads turning their eyes following expressionless
the scene dissolves to the backyard just before dawn
now and then a rooster crows
a couple of lanterns light the scene as the man load the truck
it is nearly done the body piled high but flat with boxes and more tied on running boards
al has the hood open and is working on the motor
noah casy uncle john connie pa and tom are at various tasks
they talk as they work
to pa how you get all this money
sol things chopped cotton even grampa
got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol
shucked out seventy five for this truck but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on
i figger we oughta be able to make it on that
after all they aint but about twelve of us is they
proudly closing the hood shell probly ride like a bull calf but shell ride
reckon we better begin roustin em out if we aim to get outa here by daylight
how about it john
how you boys comin
he casts a critical eye over the truck inside the cabin ma sits on a box in front of the stove
the fire door is open and the light shines out
the room itself has been pretty well stripped with only trash and discarded things left
in mas lap is a pasteboard shoebox and she is going through the meager treasures stored in it to see what must go and what she can take with her
her eyes are soft and thoughtful as each item brings a memory but not sad
occasionally she smiles faintly
she pulls out a letter looks at it starts to throw it into the fire then puts it back in the box
her hand pulls out a picture postcard
we see it in mas hand
it is a picture of the statue of liberty
over it greetings from new york city
she turns it over
it is addressed mrs
joad rfd oklahomy territory
in the space for a message hello honey
ma after a moment of studying it throws the card into the fire
she lifts the letter again puts it back
she pulls out a worn newspaper clipping
we see it in mas hand
the headline is joad gets seven years
ma drops the clipping into the fire
rummaging around she pulls out a small china dog
we see it closely as before
on it is printed souvenir of louisiana purchase exposition st
ma studies the dog smiling remembering something that it meant in her life
then she puts in in a pocket in her dress
next she pulls out some pieces of cheap jewelry one cuff link a babys signet ring two earrings
she smiles at the ring then pockets it
the cuff link too
the earrings she holds for a moment longer then looks around to make sure nobody sees then holds them to her ears not looking into any kind of a mirror
just feeling them against the lobes of her ears as once perhaps she wore them
her eyes are grave
from the door how about it ma
ma looks at the earrings and then at the contents of the box
she lifts out the letter again and looks at it
then without drama she drops it into the fire
she watches it burn
her eyes are still on the flame as she calls
wake up the chillun
were fixin to leave
the flame dies down
in the backyard it is grey dawn
there is a thrill of quiet excitement as they all stand around the loaded truck hats on putting on coats
the ones missing are ma rosasharn the children and grampa
pa is in charge
as ma comes out of the cabin wheres grampa
al go git him
trying to climb in the front seat im gonna sit up front
somebody hep me
tom easily lifts her up the step
the two children come running out of the house chanting
goin to california
goin to california
you kids climb up first on top
all obey as he directs als gonna drive ma
you sit up there with him and granma and well swap around later
i aint gonna sit with grampa
connie you hep rosasharn up there alongside ruthie and winfiel
looking around wheres grampa
with a cackle where he alays is probly
well leave him a place but noah you and john yall kinda find yourself a place kinda keep it even all around
all have obeyed and are aboard but pa tom and casy who is watching the springs flatten out
think shell hold
if she does itll be a miracle outa scripture
lemmo go gol dang it
lemmo go i tell you
in a corner of the house al is pulling grampa gently but firmly the old man holding back and furious
he flails feebly at al who holds his head out of the way without effort
he wasnt sleepin
he was settin out back a the barn
theys somepin wrong with him
ef you dont let me go al permits grampa to jerk loose and sit down on the doorstep
the old man is miserable and frightened and angry too old to understand or accept such a violent change in his life
tom and pa come up to him
the others watch solemnly from their places in the truck
whats the matter grampa
dully sullenly aint nothin the matter
i just aint a goin thats all
what you mean you aint goin
we got to go
we got no place to stay

he notices nothing
he takes another dram of the coffee

the scene dissolves to the truck
it is just after dawn
pa tom and noah are lifting grampa into the truck
he mumbles angrily but is unconscious of what is happening
fretfully easy easy
you wanta bust his head wide open
pull his arms john
mumbling aint a goin thas all

looking around everbody set now
a chorus of responses awright al letta go
the engine rattles and roars shakily
grinning with excitement pa sits down and pats grampa clumsily

the truck starts to move heavily
casy stands watching it
good by an good luck
hold er al
the car stops aint you goin with us
after a pause id like to
theres somethin happenin out there in the wes an id like to try to learn what it is
if you feel you got the room
he stops politely
pa looks from one face to the other in the truck a swift silent canvass and though no one speaks or gives any other sign pa knows that the vote
heartily come on get on plenty room
sure come on casy plenty room
quickly he climbs aboard
the truck rattles into motion again
excitedly here we go
grinning california here we come
as they all look back the deserted cabin is seen from the departing truck
now we see the family in the truck as it snorts and rattles toward the road a study of facial expressions as the joad family look back for the last
time at their home
connie and rosasharn whispering giggling and slappings are oblivious of the event
ruthie and winfield are trembling with excitement
but toms and pas smiles have disappeared and all the men are gazing back thoughtfully and soberly their minds occupied with the solemnity of this great adventure
in the front seat of the truck
al is driving
granma is already dozing
ma looks steadily ahead
grinning aint you gonna look back ma
give the ol place a last look
coldly shaking her head were goin to california aint we
awright then lets go to california
sobering that dont sound like you ma
you never was like that before
i never had my house pushed over before
i never had my fambly stuck out on the road
i never had to lose
everthing i had in life
she continues to stare straight ahead
the truck is lumbering up onto a paved highway
the scene dissolves to a montage almost filling the screen is the shield marker of the u
superimposed on it is a montage of jalopies steaming and rattling and piled high with goods and people as they pull onto the highway to indicate as much as possible
that this departure of the joad family is but part of a mass movement of jalopies and families
the signs of towns on u
highway flash past this dissolves to a highway
it is late afternoon
the joad truck pulls of the paved highway and stops
the men leap down quickly from the truck all but pa who lifts grampa in his arms and then lowers him slowly gently into toms arms
in toms arms grampa is whimpering feebly
aint a goin
aint a goin
s all right grampa
you just kind a tard thats all
somebody fix a pallet
with a quilt pulled from the truck ma runs ahead as tom carries grampa toward a clump of woods back off the highway
the others get down soberly from the truck all but granma who is dozing
cars pass a fast car passing a jalopy
tom is letting the old man down gently as ma adjusts the quilt on the ground
death is in grampas eyes as he looks up dimly at them
a whisper thas it jus tard thas all
he closes his eyes the scene dissolves to an insert of a note
it is written awkwardly in pencil on the flyleaf of a bible
toms voice recites the words
this here is william james joad dyed of a stroke old old man
his folkes bured him becaws they got no money to pay for funerls
nobody kilt him
jus a stroke an he dyed
a grave at night
in the clump of woods lighted by two lanterns the joad tribe stands reverently around an open grave
having read the note tom puts it in a small fruit jar and kneels down and reaching into the grave places it on grampas body
i figger best we leave something like this on him lest somebody dig him up and make out he been kilt
reaching into the grave lotta times looks like the govment got more interest in a dead man than a live one
not be so lonesome either knowin his name is there with im not just a old fella lonesome underground
straightening up casy wont you say a few words
i aint no more a preacher you know
but aint none of our folks ever been buried without a few words
after a pause ill say em an make it short
all bow and close eyes this here ol man jus lived a life an jus died out of it
i dont know whether he was good or bad an it dont matter much
heard a fella say a poem once an he says all that lives is holy
but i wouldnt pray for jus a ol man thats dead because hes awright
if i was to pray id pray for the folks thats alive an dont know which way to turn
grampa here he aint got no more trouble like that
hes got his job all cut out for im so cover im up and let im get to it
the scene fades out
highway in daylight fades in an oklahoma stretch revealing a number of jalopies rattling westward
the joad truck approaches
in the front seat of the truck tom is now driving
granma is dozing again and ma is looking thoughtfully ahead
what is it ma
wasnt that the state line we just passed
after a pause yesm that was it
your pa tol me you didnt ought to cross it if youre paroled
says theyll send you up again
forget it ma
i got her figgered out
long as i keep outa trouble aint nobody gonna say a thing
all i gotta do is keep my nose clean
worriedly maybe they got crimes in california we dont know about
crimes we dont even know is crimes
laughing forget it ma
jus think about the nice things out there
think about them grapes and oranges an everbody got work waking suddenly i gotta git out
first gas station granma i gotta git out i tell ya
i gotta git out
foot on brakes awright
as the truck slows to a stop a motorcycle cop approaches after them
looking back tom sees him bearing toward them
he looks grimly at ma
they shore dont waste no time
as granma whines take her out
astraddle his motorcycle save your strength lady
to tom get goin buddy
no campin here
relieved we aint campin
we jus stoppin a minute lissen i heard that before i tell ya i gotta git out
the cop looks startled puzzled but tom shrugs a disclaimer for responsibility in that quarter
mildly shes kinda ol whimpering i tell ya okay okay
triumphantly puh raise the lawd for vittory
as ma helps granma out the other side tom and the cop exchange a glance and snother shrug at the foibles of women and then look studiedly into space
the scene dissolves to a montage superimposed on the marker of u
highway an assortment of roadside signs flashes by bar b q joes eats dr
pepper gas coca cola this highway is patrolled end of mile zone lucky strikes used cars nutburger motel drive inn free water we fix flats etc
a hand painted sign reads camp
it is night
we hear the sound of guitar music
in the camp ground a small wooden house dominates the scene
there are no facilities the migrants simply pitch makeshift tents and park their jalopies wherever there is a space
it is after supper and a dozen or more men sit on the steps of the house listening to connie play a road song on a borrowed guitar
the music softens the tired drawn faces of the men and drives away some of their shyness
in the dark outside the circle of light from the gasoline lantern on the porch some of the women and children sit and enjoy the luxury of this relative gaiety
the proprietor sits tipped back in a straight chair on the porch
we see the joad tent
behind their truck a tarpaulin is stretched over a rope from tree to tree
granma lies asleep on a quilt stirring fitfully
ma sits on the ground at her head fanning her with a piece of cardboard
rosasharn lies flat on her back hands clasped under her head looking up at the stars
the music comes to them pleasantly
all this will it hurt the baby
now dont you go gettin nimsy mimsy
sometimes im all jumpy inside
well cant nobody get through nine months without sorrow
but will it hurt the baby
they use to be a sayin a chile born outa sorrowll be a happy chile
an another born outa too much joyll be a doleful boy
thats the way i always heard it
you dont ever get scairt do you ma
only it aint scairt so much
its just waitin an wonderin
but when sumpn happens that i got to do sumpn simply ill do it
dont it ever scare you it wont be nice in california like we think
no it dont
i cant do that
i cant let mself
all i can do is see how soon they gonna wanta eat again
theyd all get upset if i done anymore n that
they all depen on me jus thinkin about that
after a pause thats my part that an keepin the fambly together
as the music ends we see a group on the porch steps
the men murmur approbation of connies playing
with quiet pride thas my son in law
sings real nice
what state yall from
had us a farm there share croppin
till the tractors druv us out
we from arkansas
i had me a store there kind of general notions store but when the farms went the store went too
sighing nice a little as you ever saw

profoundly wal ycaint tell
i figure when we git out there an git work an maybe git us a piece a growin lan near water it might not be so bad at that
payin good wages i hear
everbody got work out there
cant be no worse
as they talk a second man standing on the edge of the group begins to grin bitterly
he is much more ragged than the others
you folks must have a pot a money
the group turns to look at the man
with dignity no we aint got no money
but theys plenty of us to work an we re all good men
get good wages out there an put it all together an well be awright
the man begins to snigger and then to laugh in a high whinneying giggle which turns into a fit of coughing
all of the men are watching him
good wages eh
pickin oranges an peaches
quietly we gonna take whatever they got
whats so funny about it
sniggering again whats so funny about it
i just been out there
i been an seen it
an im goin back to starve because i ruther starve all over at once
angrily whatta you think youre talkin about
i got a hanbill here says good wages an i seen it in the papers they need pickers
awright go on

pulling out handbill but what about this
i aint gonna fret you
wait a minute buddy
you jus done some jackassin
you aint gonna shut up now
the hanbill says they need men
you laugh an say they dont
now which ones a liar
after a pause how many youall got them hanbills
come on how many
at least three quarters of the men worriedly reach into their pockets and draw out worn and folded handbills
but what does that prove
look at em
same yella hanbill pickers wanted
awright this man wants men
so he prints up a them hanbills an maybe people sees em
an maybe two three thousan starts movin wes account a this hanbill
two three thousan folks thats crazy with worry headin out for jobs
does that make sense
there is a long worried silence
the proprietor leans forward angrily
what are you a troublemaker
you sure you aint one a them labor fakes
i swear i aint mister
well dont you go roun here tryin to stir up trouble
drawing himself up i tried to tell you folks sumpn it took me a year to fin out
took two kids dead took my wife dead to show me
but nobody couldnt tell me neither
i cant tell ya about them little fellas layin in the tent with their bellies puffed out an jus skin on their bones an shiverin an whinin like pups an
me runnin aroun tryin to get work shouting not for money not for wages jus for a cup a flour an a spoon a lard
an then the coroner came
them children died a heart failure he says an put it in his paper
with wild bitterness heart failure
an their little bellies stuck out like a pig bladder
he looks around at the men trying to control his emotions and then he walks away into the darkness
there is an uneasy silence
well gettin late
got to get to sleep
they all rise as at a signal all moved and worried by the second mans outburst
tom pa and casy move away worry on their faces
spose hes tellin the truth that fella
hes tellin the truth awright
the truth for him
he wasnt makin nothin up
how about us
is that the truth for us
i dont know
worriedly how can you tell
the scene dissolves to a montage superimposed on the shield marker of u
highway and the rattling joad truck the signs of towns flash by amarillo vega glenrio
the truck is seen on the highway
it is now mountain country new mexico
then it is seen at a gas station
it is a cheap two pump station hand painted dreary dusty
huddled next to it is a hamburger stand
in front of the hamburger stand is a truck labeled new mexico van and storage company
the joads are piling out of their truck
directed by ma noah lifts granma out
the two children scamper around shrieking because their legs have gone to sleep
al is preparing to put water in the radiator
pa takes out a deep leather pouch unties the strings and begins calculating his money as the fat proprietor advances
truculently you folks aim to buy anything
need some gas mister
got any money
whatta you think wes beggin
i just ast thats all
evenly well ask right
you aint talkin to bums you know
appealing to heaven all in the worl i done was ast
inside the hamburger stand a standard cheap eatery bert is doing the short orders and mae is handling the counter
a nickel phonograph is playing a tune
bill a truck driver sits at the counter his partner fred is playing a slot machine
kinda pie ygot
banana cream pineapple cream chocolate cream and apple
cut me off a hunk a that banana cream and a cuppa java
make it two
two it is
smirking seen any new etchins lately bill
grinning well heres one aint bad
little kid comes in late to school
teacher says he stops
pa is peering in the screen door
beside him ruthie and winfield have their noses flattened against the screen
mae looks at pa
could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf of bread maam
this aint a grocry store
we got bread to make sanwidges with
i know maam
ony its for a ole lady no teeth gotta sofn it with water so she can chew it an shes hongry

embarrassed i shore would like to do that maam but the fack is we aint got but a dime for it
its all figgered out i mean for the trip
you cant get no loaf a bread for a dime
we only got fifteen cent loafs
an angry whisper give em the bread
well run out fore the bread truck comes
awright then run out
mae shrugs at the truck drivers to indicate what shes up against while bert mashes his hamburgers savagely with the spatula
pa and the two children come in as mae opens a drawer and pulls out a long waxpaper covered loaf of bread
the children have been drawn to the candy showcase and are staring in at the goodies
this heres a fifteen cent loaf
would you could you see your way to cuttin off ten cents worth
a clinched teeth order give im the loaf
no sir we wanta buy ten cents worth thas all
sighing you can have this for ten cents
i dont wanta rob you maam
with resignation go ahead bert says take it
taking out his pouch pa digs into it feels around with his fingers for a dime as he apologizes
may soun funny to be so tight but we got a thousan miles to go an we dont know if well make it
but when he puts the dime down on the counter he has a penny with it
he is about to drop this back in the pouch when his eyes fall on the children staring at the candy
slowly he moves down to see what they are looking at
then is them penny candy maam
the children look up with a gasp their big eyes on mae as she moves down behind the counter
there them stripy ones
mae looks from the candy to the children
they have stopped breathing their eyes on the candy
well no thems two for a penny
well give me two then maam
he places the penny carefully on the counter and mae holds the sticks of candy out to the children
they look up at pa
beaming sure take em take em
rigid with embarrassment they accept the candy looking neither at it nor at each other
pa picks up the loaf of bread and they scramble for the door
at the door pa turns back
thank you maam
the door slams
bill turns back from staring after them
them wasnt two for a cent candy
belligerently whats it to you
them was nickel apiece candy
we got to get goin
were droppin time
both reach in their pockets but when fred sees what bill has put down he reaches again and duplicates it
as they go out of the door
hey wait a minute
you got change comin
from outside whats it to you
as mae watches them through the window her eyes warm bert walks around the counter to the three slot machines a paper with figures on it in his hand
the truck roars outside and moves off
mae looks down again at the coins
playing a machine what ya want
as he looks we see the coins on the counter
they are two half dollars
reverently truck drivers
there is a rattle of coins as bert hits the jackpot
in his left hand on the machine is a paper with three columns of figures on it
the third column is much the longest
he scoops out the money
i figgered no
was about ready to pay off
the scene fades out
the arizona border in daylight fades in
it is in a gap in the mountains and beyond can be seen the painted desert
a border guard halts the joad truck
he is not as tough as his words indicate just curt and matter of fact
where you going
who is driving california
how long you plan to be in arizona
no longern we can get acrost her
got any plants
putting sticker on windshield okay
go ahead but you better keep movin
we aim to
the truck rattles into movement
the scene dissolves to a montage superimposed on the shield marker of u
highway and the joad truck
signs flash by flagstaff water a gal water a gal water a gal and finally needles calif
in the foreground their backs turned the joads stand on and about their truck looking in a long silence at what can be seen of california from needles
their silence is eloquent
the faces of the joads are blank with dismay for this is an unattractive sight indeed
finally there she is folks the land a milk an honey california
sullenly well if thats what we come out here for
they look at each other in disappointment
timidly to connie maybe its nice on the other side
them pitchers them little poscards they was real pretty
rallying them aw sure
this heres jus a part of it
aint no sense a gettin scairt right off
come on lets get goin
she dont look so tough to me
the joads and the landscape are seen again
then the scene dissolves to the bank of a river
the camp at needles is on the bank of the colorado river among some willows
we see the man of the family sitting chest deep in the shallow waters talking occasionally ducking their heads under reveling in this relief
in the background are the towering mountains
got that desert yet
gotta take her tonight
take her in the daytime fella says shell cut your gizzard out
to al hows granma since we got her in the tent
shes off her chump seems to me
shes outa her senses awright
all night on the truck keep talkin like she was talkin to grampa
shes jus wore out thats all
worriedly i shore would like to stop here a while an give her some res but we ony got bout forty dollars left
i wont feel right till were there an all workin an a little money comin in
lazily after a silence like to jus stay here myself
like to lay here forever
never get hungry an never get sad
lay in the water all life long lazy as a brood sow in the mud
looking up at the mountains never seen such tough mountains
this heres a murder country just the bones of a country
thoughtfully wonder if well ever get in a place where folks can live thout fightin hard scrabble an rock
sometimes you get to thinkin they aint no such country
they look up as a man and his grown son stand on the bank
hows the swimmin
we aint tried none
sure feels good to set here though
mind if we come in an set
she aint our river
but well len you a little piece of her
they start to shuck off their clothes
the man excluding those undressing form another scene
we come from there
goin back home
panhandle come from near pampa
in surprise can you make a livin there
the man and his son sit down in the water
continuing but at leas we can starve to death with folks we know
there is a long silence among the joads as the man and his son splash water over their heads
slowly ya know youre the second fella talked like that
id like to hear some more about that
me an you both
the man and his son exchange a glance as though the joads had touched on the deadliest of subjects
finally he aint gonna tell you nothin about it
if a fellas willin to work hard cant he cut her
i dont know everthing
you might go out an fall into a steady job an id be a liar
an then you might never get no work an i didnt warn you
all i can tell ya most of the folks is purty misable
sullenly but a fella dont know everthing
there is a disturbed silence as the joads study the man but he obviously has no intention of saying anything more
finally pa turns to his brother
john you never was a fella to say much but ill be goldanged if you opened your mouth twicet since we lef home
what you think about this
scowling i dont think nothin about it
were a goin there aint we
when we get there well get there
when we get a job well work an when we dont get a job well set on our behins
thats all they is to it aint it
laughing uncle john dont talk much but when he does he shore talks sense
he spurts water out of his mouth the scene dissolves to a gas station at night
the joad truck loaded with goods and people is last gas and servicing before the desert
two white uniformed boys handle the station
a sign reads last chance for gas and water
al is filling the radiator
tom is counting out the money for the gas
you people got a lotta nerve
what you mean
crossin the desert in a jalopy like this
you been acrost
sure plenty but not in no wreck like this
if we broke down maybe somebodyd give us a han
doubtfully well maybe
but id hate to be doin it
takes more nerve than i got
laughing it dont take no nerve to do somepn when there aint nothin else you can do
he climbs into the drivers seat ma and granma are seen lying on a mattress in the truck
granmas eyes are shut
actually she is near death
ma keeps patting her
softly dont you worry granma
its gonna be awright
i want grampa
dont you fret now
the truck moves off
we see the gas station again with the truck pulling away
the first boy a lad who knows everything stands looking after them shaking his head
his assistant is cleaning up the pumps
holy moses what a hard lookin outfit
all them okies is hard lookin
boy but id hate to hit that desert in a jalopy like that
contentedly well you and me got sense
them okies got no sense or no feeling
they aint human
a human being wouldnt live like they do
a human being couldnt stand it to be so miserable
just dont know any better i guess
noah is seen hiding behind a corner of the gas station
peering out he sees that the truck has gone
he turns to walk away into the darkness
the scene dissolves to a river bank at night and noah is once more seated in the shallow water splashing looking up at the mountains content
the truck is rattling along u
highway across the desert in the night
in the drivers seat tom is driving al and pa are by his side
what a place
howd you like to walk acrost her
people done it
if they could we could
lots must a died too
after a pause well we aint out a it yet
ruthie and winfield huddle together in the truck eyes wide with excitement
this heres the desert an were right in it
trying to see i wisht it was day
tom says if its day itll cut you gizzard smack out a you
trying to see too i seen a pitcher once
they was bones everplace
some i guess but mosly cow bones
ma and grandma are seen again
the old woman lies still breathing noisily
ma continues to pat her
whispering s awright honey
everythings gonna be awright
then we see the truck still churning along highway by night
casy is asleep in the truck his face wet with sweat
connie and rosasharn are huddled together damp and weary
seems like we wasnt never gonna do nothin but move
im so tard
sullenly women is always tard
fearfully you aint you aint sorry are you honey
slowly no but but you seen that advertisement in the spicy western story magazine
dont pay nothin
jus send em the coupon an youre a radio expert nice clean work
pleadingly but we can still do it honey
sullenly i ought to done it then an not come on any trip like this
her eyes widen with fright as he avoids meeting her glance
ma and grandma lie side by side
mas hand is on grandmas heart
the old womans eyes are shut and her breathing is almost imperceptible
whispering we cant give up honey
the familys got to get acrost
you know that
everthing all right
ma does not answer immediately
her head lifted she is staring at granmas face
then slowly she withdraws her hand from grandmas heart
slowly yes everthings all right
i i guess i dropped off to sleep
her head rests again
she lies looking fixedly at the still face
the scene dissolves to an inspection station near daggett california at night
obeying a sign that reads keep right and stop the joad truck pulls up under a long shed as two officers yawning come out to inspect it
one takes down the license number and opens the hood
the people aboard the truck bestir themselves sleepily
whats this here
we got to go over your stuff
got any vegetables or seed
well we got to look over your stuff
you got to unload
ma gets down off the truck her face swollen her eyes hard
there is an undercurrent of hysteria in her voice and manner
we got a sick ol lady
we got to get her to a doctor
we cant wait
almost hysterically you cant make us wait
well we got to look you over
i swear we aint got anything
i swear it
an granmas awful sick
pulling him to the truck look
the officer lights his flashlight on granmas face
shocked you wasnt foolin
you swear you got no fruit or vegetables
no i swear it
then go ahead
you can get a doctor at barstow
thats just eight miles
but dont stop
dont get off
ma climbs back up beside granma
the truck starts
to john tell tom he dont have to stop
granmas all right
the truck moves away on highway
the scene dissolves to the tehachapi valley by day
taking it from the book there is a breath taking view of the valley from where highway comes out of the mountains
this is the california the joads have dreamed of rich and beautiful the land of milk and honey
it is just daybreak with the sun at the joads back
they have pulled off the side of the road and stopped just to drink in the sight
they are looking almost reverently at the sight before them as they climb stiffly out of the truck
will ya look at her
shaking his head i never knowed they was anything like her
one by one they climb down
i want ma to see it
come here ma
he starts back
ma is holding to the rear of the truck her face stiff and swollen her eyes deep sunk her limbs weak and shaky
shocked ma you sick
hoarsely ya say were acrost
eagerly look ma
an were still together most of us
her knees buckle and she sits down on the running board didn you get no sleep
was granma bad
after a pause granmas dead
since before they stopped us las night
an thats why you didnt want em to look
nodding i was afraid theyd stop us an wouldnt let us cross
but i tol granma
i tol her when she was dyin
i tol her the fambly had ta get acrost
i tol her we couldnt take no chances on bein stopped
with the valley for background ma looks down on it
softly so its all right
at leas shell get buried in a nice green place
trees and flowers aroun
smiling sadly she got to lay her head down in california after all
the scene fades out
a town street by day fades in
down a town or small city business street with quite a bit of traffic comes the joad truck being pushed by the joad men
at the wheel aiming at a corner gas station is rosasharn frightened and uncertain with ma beside her on the front seat
in the back ruthie and winfield are delighted with this new form of locomotion
crossing the street a policeman falls into step with tom
how far you figger you gonna get this way
we give out a gas
it is a two pump station and one of the pumps has a car with the attendant servicing it
the joad truck stops by the other pump and tom wiping his face with his sleeve grins and address himself to the policeman
the others stand listening solemnly in the background
wheres the bes place to get some work aroun here
pulling out the handbill dont matter what kin either
patiently if i seen one a them things i must a seen ten thousan
aint it no good
shaking his head not here not now
month ago there was some pickin but its all moved south now
wherebouts in oklahoma you from
i come out from cherokee county two years ago
pleased why connies folks from cherokee county stopping her wearily okay maam lets dont go into it
i already met about a hundred firs cousins an it mus be five hundred secon
but this is what i got to tell you dont try to park in town tonight
keep on out to that camp
if we catch you in town after dark we got to lock you up
worriedly but what we gonna do
about to leave pop that just aint up to me
grimly he points to the handbill but i dont min tellin you the guy they ought to lock up is the guy that sent out them things
he strolls away the joads looking concernedly after him just as the gas station attendant comes briskly to them after disposing of the other car
brightly how many folks
after a pause one
the attendant regards him in disgust
the scene dissolves to hooverville by day
a large migrant camp a typical shanty town of ragged tents and tarpaper shacks jalopies and dirty children
a dozen or more children pause to watch as the joad truck lumbers down a dirt incline from the road and stops at the edge of the camp in front
of one of the most miserable of the shacks
the joads regard the camp with dismay
shaking his head she shore dont look prosperous
want to go somewheres else
on a gallon a gas
as tom grins at her lets set up the tent
maybe i can fix us up some stew
the truck moves into the camp through a lane of children
the scene dissolves to the joad tent
in front of it ma is on her knees feeding a small fire with broken sticks
on the fire is a pot of stew
ruthie and winfield stand watching the pot
about fifteen ragged barefooted children in a half circle are now around the fire their solemn eyes on the pot of stew
occasionally they look at ma then back at the stew
presently one of the older girls speaks
shyly i could break up some bresh if you want me maam
gently you want to get ast to eat hunh
simply yes maam
didn you have no breakfast
they aint no work hereabouts
pas in tryin to sell some stuff to get gas sos we can get along
didn none of these have no breakfast
there is a long silence
then boastfully i did
me an my brother did

then you aint hungry are you
the boy chokes his lip sticks out
doggedly we et good
then he breaks and runs well its a good thing some a you aint hungry because they aint enough to go all the way roun

las night come out an say they got chicken to eat

pa and john enter
how bout it
to ruthie go get tom an al
looking helplessly at the children i dunno what to do
i got to feed the fambly
whatm i gonna do with these here
she is dishing the stew into tin plates
the childrens eyes follow the spoon and then the first plate to john
he is raising the first spoonful to his mouth when he notices them apparently for the first time
he is chewing slowly his eyes on the children their eyes on his face when tom and al enter
standing up you take this
handing plate to tom i aint hungry
whatta ya mean
you aint et today
i know but i got a stomickache
i aint hungry
after a glance at the children you take that plate inside the tent an you eat it
wouldnt be no use
id still see em inside the tent
to the children you git
go on now git
you aint doin no good
they aint enough for you
the children retreat a step but no more and then look wonderingly at him
we cant send em away
take your plates an go inside
take a plate to rosasharn
smiling to the children look
you little fellas go an get you each a flat stick an ill put whats lef for you
the children scatter but they aint to be no fightin
dishing plates for ruthie and winfield i dont know if im doin right or not but go inside everbody stay inside
the children are back they aint enough
all you gonna get is jus a taste but i cant help it i cant keep it from you
she goes in the tent hurriedly to hide the fact that tears have come into her eyes
the children pounce on the pot silently too busy digging for the stew to speak
inside the tent they have all finished their stew already
bitterly i done fine
now nobody got enough
at the road a new coupe drives off the highway and into the camp and stops
it contains two men
one gets out
a group of men are squatting in a half circle the usual pattern for conversation but they are silent now as their eyes fix on the man approaching
he is a labor agent
outside the joad tent the men are looking in the direction of the group
they start to walk toward it
at the group of men the agent wearing a flat brimmed stetson and with his pockets filled with pencils and dog eared booklets looks down at the silent men
all of the men in the camp are approaching slowly silently
the women give their anxious attention in the background
among the men who walk up is floyd a grimly disappointed young man
you men want to work
sure we wanta work
wheres it at
fruits opening up
need a lot of pickers
you doin the hirin
well im contracting the land
whay you payin
well cant tell exactly yet
bout thirty cents i guess
why cant you tell
you took the contrac didn you
but its keyed to the price
might be a little more might be a little less
quietly all right mister
you just show your license to contrack an then you make out a order where an when an how much you gonna pay an you sign it an well go
ominously you trying to tell me how to run my own business
f were workin for you its our business too
an how do we know pulling out a handbill you aint one a the guys that sent these things out
tough listen smart guy
ill run my business my own way
i got work
if you wanta take it okay
if not just sit here thats all
the squatting men have risen one by one
their faces are expressionless because they simply dont know when one of these calls is genuine or when it isnt
floyd addresses them
twicet now ive fell for that line
maybe he needs a thousan men
so he gets five thousan there an hell pay fifteen cents a hour
an you guysll have to take it cause youll be hungry
facing the agent f he wants to hire men let him write it out an say what hes gonna pay
ast to see his license
he aint allowed by law to contrack men without a license
the other man gets out of the coupe
he wears riding breeches and laced boots carries a pistol and cartridge belt and there is a deputy sheriffs star on his brown shirt
he smiles thinly and shifts his pistol holster as he starts toward the group
the men are watching the deputy approach
angrily you see
if this guy was on the level would he bring a cop along
entering whats the trouble
pointing at floyd ever see this guy before
whatd he do
giving floyd a looking over seems like i have
seems like i seen him hangin around that used car lot that was busted into
yep id swear its the same fella
sharply get in that car
you got nothin on him
open your trap again and youll go too
to the men you fellas dont wanta lissen to troublemakers
you better pack up an come on to tulare county
the men say nothing
might be a good idea to do what he says
too many of you okies aroun here already
folks beginnin to figger it aint maybe safe
might start a epidemic or sumpn
after a pause wouldnt like a bunch a guys down here with pick handles tonight would you
as the agent gets into the coupe floyds thumbs hook over his belt and he looks off away
toms look away is an answer
his thumbs also hook over his belt
to floyd now you
he takes hold of floyds left arm
at the same time floyd swings smacks him in the face
as the deputy staggers tom sticks out a foot and trips him
floyd is already running through the camp
the deputy fires from the ground
there is a scream
a woman is looking down at her hand the knuckles shot away
the coupe is seen as the agent steps on the gas to get away
as floyd gets in the clear the deputy sitting on the ground aims his pistol again slowly carefully
behind him casy steps up gauges his distance and then kicks him square in the base of the skull
the deputy tumbles over unconscious
tom picks up the pistol
gimme that gun
now git outa here
go down in them willows an wait
angrily i aint gonna run
he seen you tom
you wanta be fingerprinted
you wanta get sent back for breakin parole
hide in the willows
if its awright to come back ill give you four high whistles
as tom strides away there is the distant sound of a siren
casy empties the gun and throws cartridges and gun aside
the men aghast have been standing back worried and excited and apprehensive
they wish nothing like this had happened
the women have gathered around the wounded woman who is sobbing
now at the sound of the siren everybody begins to move uncomfortably toward his tent or shack
al looks admiringly from casy to the unconscious deputy
everybody has disappeared into his tent but al and casy
the siren draws nearer
get in your tent
you dont know nothin
how bout you
grinning some body got to take the blame
they just got to hang it on somebody you know
shrugging an i aint doin nothin but set around
but aint no reason savagely lissen
i dont care nothin about you but if you mess in this your whole fambly lible to get in trouble an tom get sent back to the penitentiary
i think youre a darn fool though
al heads for the joad tent and casy kneels down and lifts the deputy
he wipes his face clean
the deputy begins to come to
an open car curves off the highway stops in the clearing and four men with rifles pile out
the deputy sits rubbing his eyes and casy stands
whats goin on here
this man a yours he got tough an i hit him
then he started shootin hit a woman down the line so i hit him again
well whatd you do in the first place
i talked back
two of the men have helped the deputy to his feet
he feels the back of his neck gingerly
theys a woman down there like to bleed to death from his bad shootin
to assistant take a look at her
to deputy mike is this the fella that hit you
dazedly dont look like him
it was me all right
you just got smart with the wrong fella
shuddering dont look like him but
maybe it was
i aint sure
get in that car
with a deputy on either side of him casy climbs in the back seat
the sickish deputy is helped into the car
the other man comes running back
proudly boy what a mess a
they got a tourniquet on
well send a doctor out
the car starts
casy and two deputies beside him are revealed in the back seat
casy sits proudly head up eyes front
on his lips is a faint smile on his face a curious look of conquest
angry at the whole business but what you gonna do
must be thousands of em around here sore and hungry and living in them dumps
what you gonna do about em
you gotta hold em down
hold em down or theyll take over the whole country
thats all you can do
grimly well they aint gonna take over my country
i been livin here too long for that
maybe some a the boys better drop around tonight and give em something to think about
casy sits with eyes front
at the willows screened by trees or brush tom looks off at the car taking casy away
starting at a sound he withdraws into the brush as the scene dissolves
in front of the joad tent at night ma stands facing pa and al
rosasharn lies on a pallet her face in her arms while ruthie and winfield look on wide eyed at the family quarrel
to ma leave him alone ma als just billy goatin around sure
i was just aimin to meet up with a couple girls i know

sullenly id come back eyes on pa but ef you do whup me i swear you better not ever go to sleep again because the minute you go to sleep
or youre settin down or your backs turned im gonna knock you belly up with a bucket
they stand staring at each other in silence
at the edge of hooverville tom is heading for the joad tent warily glancing around constantly but not running for that would draw attention to him
in front of the joad tent again helplessly jus sassy thats all
angrily sassy my foot
im jus sick and tard a my folks tryin to bust up

in the shadows twenty feet away from the tent tom whistles softly

quietly connies gone

angrily glad to get shet of him
never was no good an never will be pa
how come i got to shh

he kneels beside rosasharn
gently dont fret honey

uncovering her face tom i jus dont feel like nothin a tall
without him i jus dont wanta live
maybe hell be back
well leave word for him
jus dont cry
he pats her awkwardly the scene dissolves to hooverville at night
the jalopies are lumbering up on the road one after the other as the migrants scatter before the threatened invasion
in the joad truck tom is helping rosasharn into the front seat beside ma
the others are aboard except al
tom hands al a wrench
just in case
sit up back an if anybody tries to climb up let im have it
from truck i aint got nothin in my han
to al give im a fryin pan
he gets into the drivers seat and starts the truck in the front seat of the truck tom drives ma sits in the middle rosasharn on the other side
hopefully maybe connie went to get some books to study up with
hes gonna be a radio expert ya know
maybe he figgered to suprise us
maybe thats jus what he done
ma they comes a time when a man gets mad
tom you tol me you promised you wasnt like that
you promised me
i know ma
im a tryin
if it was the law they was workin with we could take it
but it aint the law
theyre workin away at our spirits
theyre tryin to make us cringe an crawl
theyre workin on our decency
you promised tommy
im a tryin ma
honest i am
you gotta keep clear tom
the famblys breakin up
you got to keep clear
whats that detour
as he slows down the truck we see that half of the road is blocked with boards and red lanterns
a group of men swarm around the joad truck as it stops
a leader leans in toms window
where you think youre goin
in the front seat of the truck toms hand reaches for the jack handle on the seat at his side but mas hand clutches his arm in a steel grip
well then in a servile whine were strangers here
we heard about theys work in a place called tulare
well youre goin the wrong way an whats more we dont want no more okies in this town
we aint got work enough for them that are already here
toms arm trembles as he tries to pull it away but ma holds on tight
which way is it at mister
you turn right aroun and head north
an dont come back till the cottons ready
the truck turns around
in the front seat tom is almost sobbing with anger as he maneuvers the truck around
whispering dont you min tommy
you done good
you done jus good
the truck is going back down the road as the scene fades out
a montage fades in superimposed on growing fields hand made signs flash by no help wanted keep out this means u no then we see the joad truck pulled up
off the paved highway and jacked up while tom and al fix a puncture
ma is seated in the front seat with rosasharn
pa and uncle john are puttering about worriedly
thoughtfully sumpn got to happen soon
we got one days more grease two days flour an ten potatoes
looking at rosasharn an rosasharn we got to remember shes gonna be due soon
shaking his head it sure is hell jus tryin to get enough to eat
fella tells me theys three hunerd thousan aroun here like us a scrabblin for work an livin like hogs
cant figger what it is but sumpns wrong
a buick roadmaster which has been speeding toward them stops suddenly
driving it is a husky man named spencer whose manner is amiable and disarming
you people looking for work
mister were lookin even under boards for work
can you pick peaches
we can pick anything
well theres plenty of work for you about forty miles north this road just outside pixley
turn east on and look for hoopers ranch
tell em spencer sent you
this is electrifying news as their faces show
mister we sure that ya
as they snap into action to get under way again the scene dissolves to the front seat al driving with ma and tom beside him
they are all smiles their faces glowing with excitement
excitedly fust thing ill get is coffee cause everbody been wantin that an then some flour an bakin powder an meat
better not get no side meat right off
save that for later

rosasharns got to have some milk
get some sugar too for the coffee
you know i jus cant remember when i felt so good before
know what im a gonna do
im a gonna save up an go in town an get me a job in a garage
live in a room an eat in restaurants
go to the movin pitchers ever night
the scene dissolves to the entrance of the hooper ranch in daylight
a gravel road leads from the paved highway to the big wire gates which are enclosed
along the side of the paved highway are parked a dozen jalopies the migrants sitting soberly in them
fifty or sixty other migrants line the gravel road and the junction with the paved highway
five jalopies are in line waiting to enter the gates
and the scene is overwhelmingly policed
there must be ten motorcycle cops around
six are dismounted and strolling to keep order among the migrants along the road
three their motorcycles roaring flank the line of five jalopies
as the joad truck drives up we see the front seat
tom al and ma are beholding the scene with bewilderment
what is it a wreck
on motorcycle where you think youre going
fella named spencer sent us said they was work pickin peaches
want to work do you
pull up behind that car
calling okay for this one
take em through
the truck moving whats the matter
little trouble up ahead but youll get through
just follow the line
the motorcycle escort forms around the line of six cars and a deafening din is raised of motorcycles sirens and an inexplicable blowing of horns on the jalopies
at the same time as the gates open and the six cars start through flanked by the motorcycle cops the migrants begin spasmodic shouts but what they say cannot be
as the cars move slowly tom and al in the front seat are puzzled and worried at the demonstration
maybe the roads out
i dont know what these cops got to do with it but i dont like it
looking out an these here are our own people all of em
i dont like this
at the gates the heckling from the bystanders is spasmodic not continuous as the six jalopies in line pass through the gate into the hooper ranch
two men stand beside the gates with shotguns
they keep calling
go on go on
the joad truck passes through the gates
in the hooper ranch the six jalopies are halted at the end of a camp street
the houses are small square blocks set in line
one a little larger is a grocery store
casually about are men in pairs with metal stars on their shirts and shotguns in their hands
two bookkeepers are already passing down the cars and jotting down information
want to work
sure but what is this
thats not your affair
how many men
can all of you work
why i guess so
wages cents a box
no bruised fruit
move along and go to work right away
he moves to the next car
the joad truck starts
at house as the joad truck pulls up two deputies approach
they look closely into each face as the joads pile out
one of the deputies has a long list in his hand
say what is this here
consulting list not here
take a look at his license
aint got it
guess theyre okay
to tom now you look here
we dont want no trouble with you
jes do your work and mind your own business and youll be all right
the deputies walk away they sure do want to make us feel at home all right
ma and rosasharn step inside the house
it is filthy
a rusty tin stove resting on four bricks is all the one room contains
ma and rosasharn stand looking around at it
finally we gonna live here
after a moment why sure
it wont be so bad once we get her washed out
i like the tent better
this got a floor
wouldnt leak when it rains
outside a clerk with glasses appears pushing a cart loaded with three gallon buckets
patiently its still joad
doling out the buckets how many
at the door six
to tom all yall go
me an rosasharnll unload
with their buckets they shuffle away toward the peach trees tom pa uncle john al and the two children struggling with the enormous containers
the scene dissolves to the interior of house at night a lantern lighting the scene
sitting wherever they can the joads have finished their supper of hamburgers
and grateful they are too for the meat
wiping his mouth got any more ma
you made a dollar an thats a dollars worth
they charge extry at the compny store but they aint no other place
i aint full
well tomorra youll get in a full day full days pay an well have plenty
rising you wouldnt think jus reachin up an pickind get you in the back
think ill walk out an try to fin out what all that fuss outside the gate was
anybody wanta come with me
im jus gonna set awhile an then go to bed
think ill look aroun an see if i cant meet me a girl
things been workin on me what they was yellin about
got me all curious
i got to get a lot curiouser than i am with all them cops out there
i be back a little later
you be careful tommy
dont you be stickin your nose in anything
leaving okay ma
dont you worry
in the ranch street
there is a faint moonlight but not much and little sound from the other houses as tom strolls down the street
near the gate beyond cars pass
as tom approaches the gate a flashlight plays on his face suddenly and a guard rises from a box
where you think youre going
thought id take a walk
any law against it
well you just turn around and walk the other way
you mean i cant even get outa here
not tonight you cant
want to walk back
or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back
ill walk back
the guard watches him as he walks back and then douses his flashlight
at a section of wire fence watching his chance moving silently tom drops on the ground on his back gets his head under the bottom wire and pushes himself under
rising he crosses the paved highway
an embankment across the road from the wire fence tom clambers down it moving quietly
he picks his way down the shallow ravine
a tent there is a light inside and there are the shadows of figures
in the background beyond the tent is the silhouette of a small concrete bridge spanning a small stream
following a trail tom enters and approaches the tent
the opening is away from him
in front of the tent a man sitting on a box looks up suspiciously as tom enters
his name is joe
who are you
jus goin pas thats all
know anybody here
jus goin pas i tell you
a head sticks out of the tent
until he speaks tom does not recognize casy
whats the matter
what you doin here
well if it aint tom joad
how ya boy
thought you was in jail
no i done my time an got out
come on in
he pulls tom into the tent
inside the tent three other men sit on the ground as casy brings tom in
ones name is frank
this the fella you been talkin about
this is him
what you doin here tommy
but i seen a bunch a fellas yellin when we come in so i come out to see whats goin on
whats it all about
this heres a strike
puzzled well fi cents a box aint much but a fella can eat
they pain you fi cents
we made a buck since midday
after a long silence lookie tom
we come to work here
they tell us its gonna be fi cents
but they was a whole lot of us so the man says two an a half cents
well a fella cant even eat on that an if he got kids
after a pause so we says we wont take it

an rosasharn needs milk
think mas gonna starve that baby jus cause a bunch a fellas is yellin outside a gate
sadly got to learn like im a learnin
dont know it right yet myself but im tryin to fin out
thats why i cant ever be a preacher again
preacher got to know
shaking his head i dont
i got to ask
sticking his head in tent i dont like it
whats the matter
seems like i hear sumpn an then i listen an they aint nothin to hear
rising taint outa the question yknow
he exits all of us a little itchy
cops been tellin us how they gonna beat us up an run us outa the country
not them reglar deppities but them tin star fellas they got for guards
after a pause they figger im the leader because i talk so much
franks head sticks in the door
his voice is an excited whisper
turn out that light an come outside
theys sumpn here
quickly casy turns the light down and out
he gropes for the door followed by tom and the other man
softly what is it
there are night sounds but little else to be distinguished
cant tell if you hear it or not
you hear it tom
softly i hear it
i think theys some guys comin this way lots of em
we better get outa here
whispering down that way under the bridge span
casy leads the way softly
the bridge span is seen from the stream as casy tom and the other man wade carefully toward it
under the bridge it is almost black as they creep through the culvert
just as casy and tom step out from under the bridge on the other side a blinding flashlight hits them lighting them like day
there they are
stand where you are
halted uncertain they stand as three men with stars on their coats and pickhandles in their hands slide down the embankment
two of them hold lighted flashlights
that one in the middle the skinny one
here they are
we got em
there are faint responses from a distance
casy and tom are alone
the others have fled
the deputies approach their lights on casy and tom
listen you fellas
you dont know what youre doin
youre helpin to stave kids
shut up you red he swings the pickhandle
casy dodges but the stick cracks his skull
he falls face down out of the light
the deputies watch for a moment but casy doesnt stir
looks like to me you killed him
turn him over
put the light on him
bending over their bodies hide casy
tom seen close is breathing hard his eyes glistening
serves him right too
as the deputies straighten up tom steps forward grabs the pickhandle from the man who felled casy and swings
the blow strikes the deputys arm sending his flashlight flying and the scene is in semi darkness as tom swings again
there is a grunt and a groan as the deputy goes down
then all is confusion
backing away swinging the pickhandle tom bolts splashes a few yards through the stream turns and gains a better start by throwing the pickhandle at his pursuers
they duck and tom disappears into the night
the other men rush through the scene in pursuit
the second deputy is seen bending over the body of the man tom laid out
wheres that flash
the light flashes on the mans face
awed boy hes good and dead
you see that fella that done it
i aint sure but i caught him one across the face and believe me i give him a trade mark he aint gonna be able to shake off easy
tom is seen crashing through the bushes his face bloody
the scene fades out
the exterior of house fades in
it is day
ma comes down the street with a bundle under her arm and enters the house
inside house rosasharn sits by the window as ma enters
anybody ask anything
stand by the door
rosasharn takes her post at the door as ma kneels on the floor beside tom puts down the rag bundle and gets a basin
tom who is under a quilt is with his back alone visible
she speaks softly guardedly as she bathes his face
hows it feel tommy
busted my cheek but i can still see
whatd you hear
looks like you done it
soberly i kinda thought so
felt like it
folks aint talkin about much else
they say they got posses out
talkin about a lynchin when they catch the fella
they killed casy first
that aint the way theyre tellin it
theyre sayin you done it fust
after a pause they know what this fella looks like
they know he got hit in the face
slowly im sorry ma

outside house the bookkeeper has encountered the newcomers

at night the truck is backed up to the door of house it is already loaded
ma is speaking in a low voice to tom who is peering out from under a mattress in the truck
its jus till we get some distance
then you can come out
id hate to get trapped in here
whats goin on here
ma turns her back to the truck
the guard plays his flashlight on the joads who stand watching him ominously
were goin out
we got a job offered good job
lets have a look at you
he plays his flashlight on the truck wasnt there another fella with you
you mean that hitch hiker
little short fella with a pale face
i guess thats what he looked like
we just picked him up on the way in
he went away this mornin when the rate dropped
thinking hard whatd he look like again
was he bruised up this mornin
about the face
i didnt see nothin
quickly al is in the drivers seat with ma and pa beside him
the truck rattles into motion and moves down the street
at the gates to the ranch another guard flashes a light as al stops the car
goin out for good
got a job
he opens the gate and the truck goes through
it turns from the gravel road onto the paved highway
you done good al
al shows his pleased pride in her quiet approval
know where were a goin
shaking her head dont matter
just got to go an keep a goin till we get plenty a distance away from here
the truck is rattling along the highway
next it is day and the truck is still churning along
in the front seat tom is driving his cap pulled as far down as possible over his wounded cheek
rosasharn has taken pas place and is leaning wearily against mas shoulder
you know if connie was here i wouldnt min any a this
i know honey an just as soon as we get settled als gonna set out an look for him
how bout gas tommy
uncle john come through with five bucks he been holin out on us since we lef home
the truck keeps moving along
then it is night and the truck is still making distance
on a country road in grey dawn with a deafening clank under the hood the joad truck pulls to a stop off the side of the road
al is driving
asleep in toms arm in the front seat ma stirs awake as al turns off the ignition and gets out
he lifts the hood
shes hottern a heifer
fan belts shot
he pulls out the pieces
tom gets out and takes off the radiator cap
there is a geyser of steam
in the back of the truck the others stand looking on sleepy eyed
looking around picks a nice place for it too dont she
they all look around
at first they find nothing in sight
al and tom look at each other in disgust
gallon or two
whistling well looks like we done it this time awright
standing in truck tommy
pointing some smoke up there
tom climbs on the running board the better to see
looks like about a mile
reckon shell make it
she got to make it
as they get back in what is it
dont know but its bettern this
as al starts the truck the scene dissolves to a weather beaten wooden sign permanent camp no
of we see the gate to the government camp a wide gate in a high wire fence with a caretakers shack to one side of the gate
the caretaker stands beside his shack as the joad truck swings off the road hits an unnoticed rut that bounces the whole truck off the ground and stops
mildly you hit er too fast
in the front seat al leans angrily out of the drivers window
tom is keeping his face away from the caretakers line of vision
whats the idea of that
chuckling well a lot a kids play in here
you tell folks to go slow and they liable to forget
but let em hit that hump once and they dont forget
al starts climbing out
pa jumps down from the truck
got any room here for us
nodding youre lucky
fellow just moved out half hour ago
pointing down that line and turn to the left
youll see it
youll be in no
toilet and showers and washtubs
you mean you got washtubs
an runnin water
to al camp committeell call on you in the morning and get you fixed
folks here elect their own cops
to ma the ladies committeell call on you maam about the kids and the sanitary unit and who takes care of em
to al come inside and sign up
as ma pa and al look at each other in almost incredulous bewilderment tom climbs out of the truck
take er on down al
we gonna stay aint we
youre tootin were gonna stay
he follows the caretaker into the shack inside the shack tom enters warily alert for any indication that either his name or his scar may have been learned and telegraphed
but the caretaker obviously attaches no significance to either
the shack is bare but for a cot a table a chair and an electric light
the caretaker is seated at the table pen in hand a soiled ledger open when tom enters
i dont mean to be nosy yunderstand
i just got to have certain information
whats your name
watching him joad
writing how many of you
the joad truck is seen in front of its camp site as the joads descend
how bout it uncle john
gotta pitch this tent
groggy with sleep im a comin
you dont look so good
i aint so good but im a comin
camp site costs a dollar a week but you can work it out carrying garbage keeping the camp clean stuff like that
well work it out
whats this committee you talkin about
we got five sanitary units
each one elects a central committee man
they make the laws an what they say goes
are you aimin to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus fellas campin here
thats the way it is
after a pause an you say no cops
shaking his head no cop can come in here without a warrant
marveling i cant hardly believe it
camp i was in once they burned it out the deputies an some of them poolroom fellas
they dont get in here
sometimes the boys patrol the fences especially dance nights
you got dances too
we got the best dances in the county every saturday night

leaving mas shore gonna like it here
she aint been treated decent for a long time
as tom is at the door that cut you got
evenly crate fell on me
better take care of it
store managerll give you some stuff for it in the morning
as he exits we see the government camp with tom coming out of the shack amazement still on his face
as he walks slowly down the main camp street we share the revelation of the place to him
it is nearly daylight
roosters crow in the distance
the street is neat and orderly in a military way its cleanliness in sharp contrast to anything he has known before
inside the tents people are stirring
in front of one tent a woman is cooking breakfast
a baby is in her arms
as he walks on tom draws a breath of exultation
as he moves on looking around we see the exterior of sanitary unit no
a cheap frame building the purpose of which is pretty obvious
ruthie warily alert lest she be caught is peering in the door
she looks a long time and then she runs out of the scene
winfield is seen asleep in a quilt on the ground when ruthie enters and rousts him out
in an excited whisper git up
i got sumpn to show you
sleepily whatsa matter
tugging him its them white things made outa dish stuff like in the catalogues
he stumbles after her
the exterior of sanitary unit no
ruthie is putting on a bold front as she leads winfield into sight but she is still alert for interference
aint nobody gonna say anything
wont they ketch us
he follows her into the unit big eyed with excitement and apprehension
there is a silence
then thems where you wash your hans
then whats these
uncertainly well i reckon you stan in them little rooms an water come down outa that there little jigger up there take a bath
then excitedly jes like in the catalogues aint they
proudly i seen em bfore you did
in alarm now dont you go monking there is the sound of a toilet flushing
it is a cheap toilet and it is a loud flush which eventually ends in a long refilling of the tank just as loudly
there is a paralyzed silence
then now you done it
you busted it
i never terrified winfield comes dashing out of the unit but ruthie grabs him just outside the door
beginning to cry he struggles to get away
i didnt go to do it
fiercely keep quite will ya
shet your mouth
weeping i never knowed it
all i done was pull that string
you done busted it
they listen to the refilling of the tank but lissen here
i wont tell nobody yunderstan
i wont craftily if you wont tell what i done
he nods quickly
then ruthie begins to walk away with what she fancies is an innocent nonchalant stroll yawning casually
sniffling a little winfield mimics her a very innocent walk and yawn indeed
the scene dissolves to a ditch
alongside the ditch are some lengths of concrete pipe
tom and the two wallaces are in the ditch tom and tim picking wilkie shoveling
exulting if this dont feel good
chuckling waitll about leven oclock see how good she feels then
seems like a nice frienly fella to work for too
lotta these little farmers mighty nice fellas
trouble is theyre little they aint got much say so
shore looks like my lucky day anyway
gettin some work at las
thomas the farmer a stock man wearing a paper sun helmet enters
his face is worried as he squats down beside the ditch
what he has come to say has taken some effort and he is still uncertain and annoyed
the men stop work
maybe im talkin myself outa my farm but i like you fellas so im gonna tell you
you live in that govment camp dont you
stiffening yes sir
and you have dances every saturday night
smiling we sure do
well look out next saturday night
suddenly tense what you mean
i belong to the central committee
i got to know
dont you ever tell i told
what is it
angrily well the association dont like the government camps
cant get a deputy in there
cant arrest a man without a warrant
but if there was a big fight and maybe shooting a bunch of deputies could go in and clean out the camp
unfolding a newspaper like last night
citizens angered at red agitators burn another squatters camp warn agitators to get out of the county
sick of the expression listen
what is these reds
evertime you turn aroun somebody sayin somebody elses a red
what is these reds anyway
chuckling well i tell you
they was a fella up the country named king got about acres an a cannery an a winery an hes all a time talkin about reds
drivin the country to ruin he says
got to git rid of em he says
well they was a young fella jus come out an he was listenin one day
he kinda scratched his head an he says mr
king what is these reds you all a time talkin about
well sir mr
king says young man a red is any fella that wants thirty cents a hour when im payin twenty five
fretfully i aint talkin about that one way or the other
all im saying is that theres going to be a fight in the camp saturday night
and theres going to be deputies ready to go in
those fellas aint botherin nobody
ill tell you why
those folks in to being treated like humans
suppose the government closes its camps
suppose too many people pass through em
well when those people go back to the squatters camps theyll be hard to handle
wiping his brow go on back to work now
maybe ive talked myself into trouble but youre folks like us and i like you
extending his hand nobody wont know who tol
we thank you
grimly an they aint gonna be no fight either
they shake hands
the scene dissolves to the gate to the camp at night
it is saturday evening the night of the dance
glaring electric lights hang over the open gate
parked jalopies line the highway as the invited guests small farmers and migrants from other camps and their families arrive to be greeted and checked by a committee of three
whod you say invited you
mister an mizz clark they ast us
come right in maam
there is an air of eager anticipation of gay celebration and everyone is in his or her best the men in clean washed overalls clean shirts some with ties their
hair damp and slicked down the women in their nicest
through the gate inside the camp can be seen the outdoor dance floor brightly lighted with the camp musicians already tuning up and around the dance floor scores of wide
inside the gate to the camp we see wilkie and a dark complexioned man named jule standing among a group inside watching the arrivals
they watch sharply eyeing everyone listening to every credential
as his employer thomas comes through the gate with his wife wilkie grins and greets him with a handshake
hidy mizz thomas
sotto voce you watching out aint you
grinning dont you worry
aint gonna be no trouble
i hope you know what youre talking about
he moves away wilkie grinning after him we see the dance floor and after three pats of the foot to get the tempo the home talent dance orchestra swings into
inside the joad tent rosasharn dressed in her nicest sits gripping her hands together the music seeming to bring her to the verge of tears
ma turns from drying dishes ma i i cant go to the dance
i jus cant ma
i cant hardly stan it with connie not here an me this way
trying to cheer her why honey it makes folks happy to see a girl that way makes folks sort of giggly an happy
miserably i cant hep it ma
it dont make me giggly an happy
drying her hands ma sits beside rosasharn and takes her in her arms
tenderly you an mes goin together jus you an me
were a goin to that dance an were a goin to jus set an watch
if anybody says to come dance why ill say youre poorly
but you an me were gonna hear the music an see the fun
an you wont let nobody touch me
no an look what i got for you
smiling mysteriously ma fishes in a pocket in her dress and brings out the envelope of her treasures
from it she produces the earrings and holds them up in front of rosasharns wide eyes
softly i used to wear these when your pa come callin on me
then as she puts them on rosasharns ears youll look pretty in em tonight
they smile at each other proud in the luxury of ornaments
down the road from the gate a touring car with six men pulls of the pavement and stops
three men get out
they are bareheaded and dressed similar to the other migrants
they stroll down the highway toward the gate
the other men deputies sit watching them
they tell me youre half injun
you look all injun to me
no jes half
wisht i was full blooded
govmentd be lookin out for me an id be ridin around in a buick eight
the three men from the touring car are at the gate
wilkie and jule watch them
who give you the invitation
fella named jackson buck jackson
come on in
the three men stroll past wilkie and jule whose eyes follow them
thems our fellas
how you know
jes got a feelin
theyre kinda scared too
follow em an get a holt of jackson
see if he knows em
ill stay here
wilkie moves after them
we see the dance floor
the musicians are at it and the fiddler is calling turns
swing your ladies an a dol ce do
join hans roun an away we go
swing to the right an a swing to the lef
break now break back to back
well in front among the older folks and children who surround the floor are ma and rosasharn clinging close
a young man stops in front of them
quietly thank you kinly but she aint well
as rosasharns eyes drop
ma bends toward her a shy smile on her face
maybe you wouldnt think it but your pa was as nice a dancer as i ever seen when he was young
with a little sigh kinda makes me think a ol times
the three men stroll into sight and stand watching the dancing
one glances at ma and rosasharn but does not speak
ma has smiled back at him
wilkie and jackson are seen removed somewhat from the dance floor they are peering in the direction of the three men
i seen em before
worked at gregorios with em
but i never ast em
keep your eye on em
jus keep em in sight thats all
he moves quickly away we find ourselves inside tim wallaces tent
the five members of the central committee tim wallace chairman look grave as a year old boy reports
i seen em mr
a car with six men parked down by the euclyptus tree an one with three men on the main road
they got guns too
i seen em
thank you willie

as willie exits well it looks like the fats in the far this time
angrily what them deppities want to hurt the camp for
how come they cant leave us be
what we oughta do we oughta git us some pickhandles an quickly no
thats what they want
if they can git a fight goin then they can run in the cops an say we aint orderly he stops as wilkie enters followed by tom theyre here
we got em spotted
there is a grim pause at this news
tims eyes go hard
to tom you sure you got everthing ready
calmly aint gonna be no trouble
worriedly you aint to hurt them fellas
grinning you dont have to worry
we got everthing arranged
maybe nobodyll even see it
just dont use no stick nor no knife no piece a arn
an if you got to sock em sock em where they wont bleed
an if she gets outa han ill be in the right han corner this side the dance floor
blandly aint gonna get outa han
wilkie makes a mocking military salute as he and tom exit
the committee men look worriedly after them
mighty sure a themselves looks like
all i hope i hope they dont kill nobody
in front of the joad tent dressed to kill is al ready for the festivities
he wears a tight fitting wool suit a tie on his shirt yellow shoes and his hair is damp and slicked down
he rubs his hands together in anticipation as he strolls in the direction of the dance floor
at another tent a blonde girl sits on a box as al enters
casually he throws open his coat revealing a vivid striped shirt
this is designed to stun his quarry
gonna dance tonight
the girl ostentatiously ignores him i can waltz
aloofly thats nothin anybody can waltz
shaking his head not like me
a fat woman thrusts her head out of the tent
you git right along
this here girls spoke for
shes gonna be married an her mans a comin for her
shrugging al winks at the girl and moves on stepping and moving his shoulders and snapping his fingers in time to the music a very gay fellow indeed
the blonde girls eyes follow him
then she turns and glances cautiously toward the tent
on the dance floor we see ma and rosasharn as tom enters and stands between them
this is during a pause between dances and only a few couples stand on the floor waiting for the music to begin again
we also see the three men very casually looking around but no more casual looking than wilkie standing just behind them idly whistling
grinning shes gettin prettier ma
as rosasharn hides her face girl with a baby always gets prettier
the music starts again once more the dancers move onto the dance floor
the three men exchange a glance and step casually to the edge of the dancing space one in the lead
they survey the scene but for the moment make no further move
the atmosphere is tense
softly excuse me ma
he moves quietly out of the scene toward the three men al taking the blonde girls hand steps onto the dance floor
encircling her waist they begin to dance
they are a smooth rhythmic couple who move as one being
well you said anybody can waltz
howm i doin
dont hold me so tight
tongue in cheek why i aint hardly touchin you
squirming youre ticklin me
grabbing her still closer that comes from not holdin you tight enough
complaining but loving it now i cant breathe
at this moment the leader of the three men the other two directly behind him enters the scene
ill dance with this girl
angrily you an who else
behind the three men a solid wall of migrants are closing in quietly tom and wilkie in the middle
dont gimme no argament a shrill whistle sounds in the distance you little his fist goes back his left hand reaches for als collar
at the same instant tom grabs him wilkie claps his hand over the leaders mouth at least fifteen other men have similarly collard the other two invaders and they are
all lifted bodily
there is not a sound as the three men held in iron grips are whisked from the dance floor and into the crowd
two touring cars have stopped in front of the closed gate and the deputies have drawn guns
we hear you got a riot
i dont see no riot
got a warrant
we dont need a warrant if its a riot
well i dont know what you gonna do about it because i dont hear no riot an i dont see no riot an whats more i dont believe they is
waving toward the dance floor look for yourself
as the deputies puzzled and uncertain look toward the dance floor we see the music the dancing the gaiety continuing as if nothing had happened
within the joad tent at night several hours later the tent is black tom strikes a match
from a piece of wood on the ground or floor he selects one from several cigarette butts and lights it
while he is doing so he lifts his head suddenly and listens
in the camp street we catch sight of legs walking the ground lighted from a flashlight
two pairs of the legs wear state policemens leather leggings
the third pair are the caretakers
they stop behind a car
the flashlight plays on the license plate
one of the state cops leans down to copy the license number in a booklet
then they move on
tom has lifted the edge of the tent a trifle enough to see out by flattening his head on the floor
the legs are now seen at the joad jalopy
the light is on the license plate
the cop leans over and copies the number
they move on
tom lowering the edge of the tent sits up
quietly he pushes aside the piece of carpet that covers him
he is wearing his clothes
we see the policemans car at the caretakers hut
the two policemen get into the car
you got no right to arrest anybody without a warrant you know
well have a warrant just as soon as we check with headquarters
the car drives off leaving the caretaker looking somberly after it
within the joad tent his cap on fully dressed for travel tom is tieing the ends of the carpet into a shoulder bundle
rising he slings it across his shoulder
as he tiptoes toward the door aint you gonna tell me goodbye tommy
for a moment he looks into the darkness in her direction
i didnt know ma
i didnt know if i ought
she has risen pulling the quilt around her
he takes her by the hand
they go out
tom leads ma around behind the tent to a section of wire fence
there is a bench there
tom leads ma to it and sits her down
he sits beside her
they was some cops here ma
they was takin down the license numbers
it looks like somebody knows sumpn
softly it had to come i reckon soon or later
id like to stay
id like to be with ya smiling an see your face when you an pa get settled in a nice little place
i sure wish i could see you then
but shaking his head i guess i wont never be able to do that
i could hide you tommy
touching her hand i know you would ma

touching his face with her fingers awright tommy

worriedly but i aint thought it out clear ma

laughing uneasily well maybe its like casy says a fella aint got a soul of his own but ony a piece of a big soul the one big soul that
belongs to everbody an then
then what tom
then it dont matter
then ill be all aroun in the dark
ill be everwhere wherever you look

rising its jus stuff i been thinkin about
gimme you han ma
he climbs over the fence good by tom
later when its blowed over youll come back
youll try to fin us
good by tommy
he walks away
she stands looking after him
hes leaving her forever she knows it
she lifts her hand and waves
she tries to smile
tom turns waves smiles
his lips form the words good by ma
then he strides away into the darkness
the scene fades out
the joad truck fades in
it stands loaded in front on the joad tent while al pa uncle john ma and the little fellas pile in the last article in a fury of excitement
beyond in the background another jalopy is being prepared for travel with the same feverish haste
it is day
ad lib get them buckets on
somebody tie down the mattress
you little fellas keep outa the way
from the other truck gaily what yall hurryin so for
tell me they got twenny days work
yes sir an we aim to git in all twenny of em
other jalopies in the background are being readied for leaving an excited hopeful exodus on a new report of work
ill get rosasharn
beaming all aboard everbody
all aboard for fresno
ma comes out of the tent supporting rosasharn tenderly
for the plumpness has gone from the girl and she is thin again her face drawn and unhappy her eyes swollen with weeping and suffering
softly try to be strong honey
someday itll be diffrent someday youll have another one
youre still jus a little girl remember
pa takes rosasharns other arm
he and al and uncle john help rosasharn onto the truck
she lies down on the mattress her face away from them
make her easy john
shell be awright
in the drivers seat ready pa
as he and ma climb in the front seat let er go gallagher
the truck wabbles into motion
al races the engine
it nearly crashes another wheezing jalopy at the corner
when it turns the corner we see the gate and a line of loaded jalopies that ride out to the highway
the caretaker waves and the migrants wave back
good luck to you
good luck everbody
good by mr
much oblige to you for everthing
the joad truck turns onto the highway
in the front seat al is driving ma in the middle pa on the outside
twenty days work oh boy
be glad to get my han on some cotton
thats the kin a pickin i understan
maybe twenny days work maybe no days work
we aint got it till we get it
grinning whatsa matter ma
smiling faintly no

it made me feel bad an scared too like we was lost

watch me pass that chevvy
soberly you the one that keeps us goin ma
i aint no good any more an i know it

ma places her hand on one of pas and pats it
woman can change bettern a man
man lives in jerks baby born or somebody dies thats a jerk gets a farm or loses one an thats a jerk
with a woman its all one flow like a stream little eddies little waterfalls but the river it goes right on
woman looks at it like that
at the jalopy ahead look at that ol coffeepot steam
thinking of what ma says maybe but we shore takin a beatin
chuckling i know
maybe that makes us tough
rich fellas come up an they die an their kids aint no good an they die out
but we keep a comin
were the people that live
cant nobody wipe us out
cant nobody lick us
well go on forever pa
were the people
she says this with a simple unaffected conviction the truck steaming and rattling and churning passes the chevrolet and al leans out of the window and waves a jeering hand
as the joad truck pulls in front we see ruthie and winfield laughing with excitement over the triumph
even uncle john shares the general satisfaction
grinning he waves
as the truck moves away along the road all three and beaming and waving
further along the truck passes a sign on the side of the road
it says no help wanted
the scene fades out
