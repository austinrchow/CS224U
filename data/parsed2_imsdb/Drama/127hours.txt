written by simon beaufoy danny boyle a massive crowd it could be a sports stadium a u farewell show or new years eve on copacabana beach but whatever it is
there are thousands and thousands of us
a mexican wave erupts success celebration with so many involved its impossible to pick out anyone individually
critical mass cyclists easter crowds at st
peters basilica nyc marathon flash mobbers doing the silent disco at londons victoria station indias kumbh mela macys thanksgiving day parade raves subway parties the daytona
gradually the screen splits into and then though at times there appears to be no division at all
an overhead shot of a crammed freeway gives way to a single vehicle a toyota tacoma red and white with a topper
cut inside as aron ralston cuts off the freeway
the slickrock desert
the red dust and the burnt cliffs and the lonely sky all that which lies beyond the end of the roads
eventually arons truck is now alone on an interstate road
at the southwest edge of green river aron ralston drives under the interstate into a landscape of obscurity
he looks to his right and left not a single light perforates the absolute blackness of the san rafael desert
from high above three quarters of the screen is black and we see his trucks lights running parallel with the blackness
a sign flashes by next service miles americas challengers for the tour de france flash by in a pack of or so neon spirits
a blm sign indicates that horseshoe canyon trailhead is miles ahead through the desert darkness
from even higher above again we see him turn left into this black void
bang inside the truck now on a dirt road
music at ear bleed level
a yellow triangular sign cautioning roads may be impassable due to storms flashes past
jackrabbits dart onto the road racing him darting left and right as he chases them down
they finish the game darting back into the darkness
slowly images from the great gallery materialise on different parts of the triptych petroglyphs and pictographs dozens of ft high superhumans hovering over groups of indistinct animals dominating beasts and
onlookers alike with their long dark bodies broad shoulders and haunting eyes
billboards tv cinema www commercial america sells everything to us through every means
as many brand names as we can get
rushing across the desert grooves pulling snatching hard left and right the rear of the truck fishtails madly
curves swoops and sandy washes kick up dust clouds as everything in the truck flies all over the place
except his bike locked down and braced solid
music blazes on
another fence line
suddenly a small brown sign flashes past
he kicks down on the brakes and reverses back
its the sign pointing out the road spur to horseshoe and blue john canyons
nearly missed it
the truck turns sharp left
now a really bumpy road approaching the dirt parking area
ghostly but there are three other vehicles and two encampments at the trailhead despite signs prohibiting camping
he turns off the music and waits for a head to pop out or a light to come on but they have all turned in
he glides to a flat spot near the sign board welcoming visitors to the horseshoe canyon quadrant of canyonlands national park
he whips into the back of the truck and flings everything out of the way of his sleeping bag and pad
but no rest
the doors smash open to reveal a glorious day and arons bike careers into it
its still like a wild road movie but now on a bicycle
having parked his motorized transport he ploughs into the land like an ad for extreme sports
past bikers he vanishes temporarily in their dust cloud he wears a bandana across his face as the bikers pass by
a final telephone box past remnants of those who tried to settle or work this unforgiving land aborigines frontier settlers ranchers
all driven away from a heartland he ploughs into
cu on aron
wearing a pair of beat up running shoes and thick wool blend socks lycra biking shorts and a phish tee shirt he has a back pack with equipment but hydrates
through a gallon of water stored in an insulated three litre camelbak hydration pouch which he sucks on without stopping
his bike pummels the canyon landscape and you get a sense of the exhilaration this man gets from pitting himself alone against what nature can offer
hes clearly a fit and daring young man and these are his kicks
even uphill he hammers his way up the sandstone
gasping for oxygen his legs screaming for rest he pushes and pushes until the crest and then down down instant speed and he can suck on his water again
part of a massive clan who define themselves not by what they are but by what they do
in a way hes an action movie personified and the opening should be shot and cut to provide adrenaline in spadefuls
suddenly he hits a sand trap and hurtles forward over the handle bars face first into the sand his toe clips and momentum brings the bike with him
the bike has him trapped on the desert floor like a takedown in wrestling
he submits landing nose deep in the sand
he sits up looks around quickly to see if anyone saw
pulls out his camera from his bag and takes a a self portrait snap of the mess
at what seems like the only tree for miles he u locks his bike in the shade pockets the keys scoffs a muffin and heads off into the desert
he approaches the crest of a sand gulley and sees below him just yards down the canyon fellow hikers
he looks around
all of them in the middle of nowhere it seems
he can see now its girls passing a map back and forth between them
he rushes towards them initially above them as he walks along side
theyre aware of him before he arrives hey
are you doing the east pike
can i come along with you for a while
the girls dont reply just look at each other
im on my own
he slides surfs down so hes on the same level as them arriving in a haze of dust holding out his hand for the shake
looking at megan sure im kristi
nice to meet you
what a day
did you bike or come straight from the trail head
we left the car there
i left mine at the horseshoe canyon and biked here
you biked from horseshoe
thats miles or more
the girls exchange glances
i do this a lot
hes crazy but harmless
wasnt expecting to see anyone in the canyon today
yeah you surprised us sneaking up like that
its kind of nervy seeing a lone guy walking up to you in the middle of the desert
yeah i know i mean theres no one around for miles
and suddenly theres a guy right behind you and wait a minute why is he wearing a hockey they all laugh
let me guess
youre here for the paintings or the cathedral
weve got a bit disorientated and the map isnt great
where is it
the climbs a little tricky but its worth it
they all laugh
towards us comes aron upside down like a tiny fast spider talking all the time his voice echoing
theres thousands of holds but you cant see them until youre almost upside down and then they just keep appearing
its a bit of a act of faith so ill go first
take off as much as you dare as theres a bit of a surprise at the other end
you behave aron ralston or well tell your mother all about where you lure girls
i swear i wont look but i swear you wont care when you get out here
weve been moving towards him as he rushes towards us spider style
hes stripped to his underwear
hes lithe to say the least
we cant see the girls or whats underneath us but theres a feeling of the vertiginous as much from the weird echo and the sense of reflected light as from
the scale of the dome
and the thing is when you get to the middle
he lets go
there arent any more
we spin and watch him fall into the most exquisite emerald pool feet below
they cant see him
they can only hear the explosive crack of man on water
are you ok
of course hes ok
listen to him
aron fills the cathedral dome with his version of a phish song at the top of his voice
kristi strips to her underwear and traverses away from megan
got to be there meg
from the pool below with aron we see kristi in her underwear heading out arachnid style to the centre
before she gets there megan appears too
shes left everything on except her shoes
they crash into the pool one after the other
they bob together in the centre the light seems to come from beneath them and ripple over the heavenly ceiling
weve got to go again
and film it
eating and drying in the powerful afternoon sun
a little self consciousness has returned but its sweet natured and fun still
i really cant eat all this chocolate by myself
never mind yes i can
so have you got a girlfriend aron
well theres not really anyone special
ah so theres lots of girlfriends
theres always a girl you just dont know it yet
yeah we meet lots of guys and theres always a girl
with lots of characters in it
aron on top of a snowy peak
ive done of the winter solo ascents
wow highest person in colorado
well i figure no one else is mad enough to climb in the winter
you can be the highest person on the continent
megan shows the image to aron
didnt you see it
yeah its an old cattle guardians house the roofs caved in and someone spray painted motel on the side
smelled weird though
just like a motel then
why are you on your own
he indicates the wilderness
and i can sing phish songs as loud as i like
not those guys from
yeah i know i know
see thats why im on my own
nobody likes me or my band
they laugh as he goofs for them
he gathers all their packaging and stuffs it in his backpack
ill get this
leave no trace
theyre walking again
hey but i like a beer like the next man
you know end of the day
theyre negotiating a steep gulley
aron is way down megan at the top kristi on her way down to him
im not certified yet but thats what i want to do
an illegal instructor
its hard to get the hours to qualify
well well sign your time card today
now put your ass on my head
okay but dont look and no grabbing now if i do
oh whatever you love it
aron then quickly slips to the bottom
megan is way high kristi half way
at his most instructor ish talking all the time as he makes his way down youll have to chimney down a little ways like here watch one foot on each
wall then squat onto your right heel now your butts on the wall so you can move your right foot across now put your left foot under your butt lower down and scootch your butt down watch that black part its slick slime try not to get it on your shoes if you can get to these bomber handholds here its like an elevator shaft and just think friction to control the slide
this is a keeper so always have someone at the bottom to boost you out
he looks up to them
i didnt understand any of that
they come to a clear fork in the paths
he watches them turn their map round and round
kristi i think this is our way back
why dont you come with me to the big drop rappel
i can give you a lift back to your car
how far is it
he shows them on the map
about another miles or so i think
youll never get out before dark
no i really got to do this
anyway ive my miners lamp
you dont climb at night do you
no its great for seeing snakes in hand holds
can i get a picture then
they pose with raven feathers in their hair
listen my friends are having a party tomorrow night
you should come
yeah wed like that
drive on the east road and about miles out theres a huge inflatable scooby doo
you cant miss it
turn off and its about miles down that track
starts late and itll go right thru
lots of cheek kissing and his last picture of them
come on aron hike out with us well go get your truck hang out and have a beer
no i really got to do this
scooby doo yeah
thats the one
ill have cold beers waiting for us
and they separate down different canyons shouting to each other
vegetarian hot dogs
so thats cold beers and vegetarian hotdogs
i really cant eat all these vegetarian hotdogs by myself
never mind yes i can
the last of the dialogue fading away as they lose earshot of each other and we pull up out high over the meandering slits of sandstone
they are gone
he picks up the pace as he checks his watch
he loved them but now hes behind schedule and hes ruthless about his schedule
his sense of momentum is established again and its clear hes moving downhill into the fissure of the rock
without warning his feet suddenly slide forward from under him and he skates snap kicks trying to keep his balance on a floor of scattering pebbles left there by a
theres a flash of the sky and dazzling sunlight
only his arms and the proximity now of the walls prevent him landing hard on his ass
a small snake slithers away from his giant feet
easy aron easy now
he keeps moving descending still but a little more circumspect
he lets the change of pace allow him to whip round his pack and with the practice of thousands of times selects and plays a cd without stopping slipping the
headphones over his head
we see the cd begin to spin the display tells us theres to play before appears
suddenly louder than loud the sound of fanatical strong applause at the phish live concert in las vegas fills his head and ours
hes heard it many times as he alternatively anticipates answers all the dialogue preamble mixed over the applause
good evening las vegas
are you having a good time
are you ready for phish
whether we are or not the first song begins on a wave of adoration from his fellow phish fans
he sings along
aron keeps descending the canyon walls growing taller and closer into the narrowing slot canyon
a dry waterfall many months since its seen rain
a drop of maybe ft with no obvious climb down
way beyond his reach and jammed into the walls of the canyon is an enormous s shaped log sand bleached and wind dried it looks like a massive reptile making
its way down the canyon
beyond it aron can see his route down disappearing into narrowing darkness
to reduce the drop he scrambles down clinging to the edge pushes away and drops the final feet or so landing in a fine cloud of sand
nothing to it second nature
he snaps the log now arching above him well out of reach
sat april th
wont be coming back this way
he spins and continues seeing the first huge chockstones the size of vans their noses buried in the floor of the canyon like unexploded bombs
he easily scrambles over one and around another tight fit but hes skinny
the slot is now just ft wide and as he stops to look at massive tree logs jammed at strange angles high above him and silhouetted against the blue cloudless
sky he drinks deeply from his water bottle
on we go and so does the concert
he pumps the air unaware as we track above him its like the canyon in star wars and hes anakin feeling the force
one set of chockstones leads to another and he rapidly negotiates them like an obstacle race until theres one the size of a big refrigerator which has been stopped by
the walls inches from the floor
over or under
he drops to his belly and squeezes underneath rucking the sandy floor in front of him
hes halfway his chest rising out the far side when suddenly he cant move
the music jams and loops on notes like bad techno
he pushes but nothing
he reaches back with his hand and releases a part of his rucksack strap thats snagged
and the music releases too
he squat jumps out and brushes off the sand
no panic a nothing moment
now its steeper
were already ft below ground level and its falling away further in front of us
another drink and the map is out
we see a section of the canyon and the tiny figure of aron moving within it
we track in and elide into a graphic view of him chimneying his way along the canyon now only ft wide at most
its a chance to see his skill and thirst for climbing
and to see how deep hes going
he uses his legs back and natural body weight to body walk along and down the towering walls
hes moving towards a final chockstone below him jammed in the gap
you can see the way hes thinking its about the size of a bus wheel and used as a platform will help him reduce the foot drop and get quickly
down into the next section
he reaches it at the same time we do and kicks fiercely automatically to make sure its solid
and across he steps onto it
as before he squats and clambers down the back side of the stone to reduce his drop down
just as he dangles theres a scraping sound small but close too close and the stone judders towards him pulled by the torque of his weight on his side rotating
instantly and instinctively he lets go and drops
like hes trying to detach a mine dragging him to the sea floor
but it follows him down somehow hes released its latent energy
he watches the chockstone follow him not looking where hes going
the backlit chockstone falling towards him consuming the sky
his arms rise to protect his head but his eyes remain open and through his fingers we see the next seconds
the rocks face and his
it grabs his left hand and flings it against the left wall
he pulls it away as the rock ricochets against the canyon and careers towards his right arm which he raises to compensate for withdrawing the left and to protect his
the rock smashes the right hand and wrist against the wall and drags it down the remaining distance
like a cheese grater it tears the skin from the back of the hand and the forearm decorating the wall
aron is powerless to stop its force and he lands on his feet allowing the rock to jam in front of him with his hand held against the canyon wall
by the stone
all this happens too quickly
we can hardly register whats happened as everything stops
hes standing behind the rock
like hes in a line for a bus
like hes shaking someones hand
a hand shake with the canyon
adrenaline searing roaring pain and panic
fuck get your hand out of there
pulls and pulls yanks until his shoulder will dislocate but nothing moves
sweat anxiety flaring hot pain
pushing with his left hand desperate to reverse the action so simple to undo the moment to reverse gravity for a split second and pull his hand out
again and again thrusting up with knees thighs pelvis left arm head neck
then slam upwards harder than ever as though hes run at it from a hundred yards and its a door that will surely burst open
air exploding out of his lungs
and then a quiet hollow sound of the boulder shifting fractionally
a howl of phenomenal pain he reverses the fraction and collapses in sweat and blood knees bleeding good fingers lacerated
but he remains upright attached
unable to physically collapse
grabs his shirt and wipes sweat away and goes to drink
he hula hoops out of his backpack to get access to the water gulps down full throatfulls stops mid th and backwashes as much as he can into the bottle
he caps the lid tightly and drops it into his pack
he breathes and breathes taking stock for the st time
stares at it until it changes to
pm the watch is working
he examines the boulder at each point he can reach stretching and contorting to see into his crushed and wretched hand where his thumb is visible above and his little
no matter how much he touches them there is no feeling
he prods up and down to see what feeling is left and where it stops
comparing left hand to where the right hand is trapped to measure the width of his right wrist now smaller than the width of his little finger on his right
he can barely get the little finger of his left hand in the gap
we reverse back on him at each contortion
what the fuck
how the fuck did you get your hand trapped by a fucking boulder
its crushed its fucking dying man
he reaches up and touches the trail of blood hair and skin left on the canyon wall as the rock pushed him to where he is
looks under boulder no blood check
he hears the crowd cheering on his headphones
its been playing throughout
he switches it off he looks above for the first time
to see the slot canyon back and back and back nothing more than a dry crack in the surface of this massive land
gradually his cries for help become inaudible
he unpacks everything with great energy like a stocktake and lays it all out on the surface of the rock
chocolate bar wrappers and bakery bag with crumbs of chocolate muffin inside that he volunteered to take away on behalf of the girls small bean burritos cd player cds extra
aa batteries mini digital video camcorder small multi use tool and led headlamp
of all these elements these are now his only companions and their pov of him reflects that as he tests each one for its potential opening all the blades and
laying them out to look at them sunglasses scratched bike ulok key rock climbing harness cloth goggles bag rapelling equipment water bottle car keys plastic grocery bag empty de hydration pack money credit cards green and yellow climbing rope in black zippers bag a stick stones and sand
he stares at it all and it all stares back at him
inside the tiny gap we see
his headlamp flick on to let him assess the rock and the wall and his hand in between it
he picks a point and begins to chip away with the knife
hes back energy movement purpose action makes him happy
he occasionally stops to look at his left hand swollen and puffy and constantly in need of flexing
he gets into a rhythm of tick tick tick flex and back again tick tick tick
pm changes to
in a huge close up of this eye he can see in the foreground that theres a pile of steel filings from the knife itself almost as big as the
dust from the ground not good
he blows the whole lot into our face with a mighty gust
when in a hole
alternative he starts digging away at the wall instead same result
its hard as iron
youre gonna have to cut your arm off
as if to answer that idea we
tapping a rock in his hand onto the top of the knife as he balances it against the wall or with his mouth
weird close angles as he almost taps the side of his eye socket
suddenly he hammers down with ten times more force onto the handle of the knife the rock explodes in his hand showering pick dust over everything and bouncing the knife
off the rock
once again gravity takes over
the knife hits his shorts and as he moves to grab it he misses it and knocks it further round the back of his leg
he pivots and turns to try and catch it but gravity is quicker than his restricted twist and it falls into a hole between the rounded rocks near his left
foot the knife is visible in the crack below and behind his right leg but he cant twist to get anywhere near it
he tries to pull the canyon wall off balance to get closer
he pulls off his right sock and shoe and tries to squeeze his foot into the hole
he looks upward
he cant believe hes done it
were on a level with the knife in the little hole beneath his feet
an enormous overhead light switches on arons headlamp placed above to let him see
the stick enters from top of screen and nudges the knife in a semi circle
its a bit punch and judy if it wasnt so fucking serious
the knife remains where it is
maybe an ant races across it
the stick withdraws
the stick re enters with the top of it almost broken off acting like a hook we push in on the knife as the stick hooks through the little ring
at the end of the knife
looking down onto the ground around his leg his toes holding the stick like a chopstick lift the knife out and up tremulously breathlessly towards his good arm
he picks it off the stick gently
we pass through the transparent title on our way along the canyon
were on a wind blowing dust through the canyon walls to find a miner in the distance digging into the rock
its aron of course and his head lamp is filled with the dust swirling through
hes using the shorter file from the multi tool and has tied a shoe lace to his wrist and looped through the ring at the end of the tool
he pulls his cap down to keep most of the dust out of his eyes
his lips are caked but he keeps blowing on his arm to keep it clear
the watch now luminous changes to
midnight is celebrated with a tiny careful sip of the water
he holds it in his mouth
puffing his cheeks circulating the precious fluid around
daylight a lunar landscape almost though with patches of green and giant boulders aron whom we sense only by being around his shoulder is out walking with his friend mark
von eeckhout through this field of boulders
they come upon one the size of a house buried nose deep in the field
wow look at the size of this one
theres no cliffs or mountains anywhere near
we look at marks pleasant unremarkable face for far too long as he looks around how the fuck did this get there
its like were on the moon looking over buzz aldrins shoulder at neil armstrong it certainly sounds like that
chip chip chip stretches his arm flexes his legs tick tick tick
he changes the blade prising suddenly at a section of the rock with his file
it bites and a dime size shred chip of rock arcs through the night light
he catches it perfectly on his right elbow
he picks it off his arm and places it on top of the rock next to where hes working
its a grain of sand on the seashore but its something
boy his arm and his legs are aching now
hes stepped into his harness and is throwing ft of rope up towards us
theres a tangle of knots and carabiners looking for purchase close to camera
each time it falls back all the way
he persists each time varying his line of attack fractionally
finally it catches
he pulls gently at first then fiercely it holds and we slide softly and slowly down the rope and as we reach him he gently takes the weight off his
lovely relief for him light off his eyes close
a re run of the accident
he can now witness it in detail as though it were planned and his role is to point us where to look
we fall with his face in high definition slow motion watching his future
we fall with the rock pitilessly chasing him down to the floor of the canyon
as he lands
his eyes open and he stands unsteadily rubbing at his legs the lack of circulation has forced him up
doesnt think about the dream starts chipping again
lit only by his lamp the black shifts to grey and then theres light
he watches it arrive
a rush of wind
something flaps and he looks up sharply caw caw
a black raven flies symmetrically the length of the canyon slit above him
blue blue sky
as he stretches his neck to follow the path of the only other living thing he freezes stock still
the bird has gone
he switches his light off
on top of some x vehicles are ft huge easter island like masks multi coloured
multiple bikes are strapped to the backs of the vehicles too
more of arons friends including mark v
mill around their x s
there are multiple lights in the distance but its unclear what it might be
the vehicles own headlights illuminate rana a stunningly beautiful red haired woman in her mid s effortlessly organising the or so group
as before we remain behind aron
by the cameras virtually complete concentration on rana its clear hes a fan
ok lights off and line up alongside me
they turn off their vehicles headlights as she draws a long line in the sand and they join her standing on one side of it
on the other side of this line everything will be different
as they all hold hands and together step cross the line arons keen and ever so slightly ahead of everyone across the line the sparkling lights of the crescent shaped
town of vehicles and camps that is burning man are replaced by an astonishing sunrise in the nevada desert
they hoot and holler as rana smiles beautifully at aron
and remember stick together the desert wants to kill you
aron is very still looking at the rock and the open blade lying on top of it
suddenly he looks over his shoulder to see
a dagger of sunlight appear behind him
his won sunrise
am he looks at ithe sunbeam as though its his prey and it might run away
it makes its way along the canyon walls towards him
hes very still
but it shifts across the floor and its going to miss him
he whips off his left shoe and sock and pushes it towards the coming light
slowly it climbs and caresses his ankle and lower calf
he pulls the other sock off and alternates the feet
he looks like hes doing yoga
as it leaves him passing overhead it suddenly bursts into the opening in front of him
its a beautiful sight as the colors of the canyon reawaken but we can see from above that he appears to be behind a door with a room of life
its three oh five on sunday
this marks my twenty four hour mark of being stuck in blue john canyon above the big drop
my name is aron ralston
my parents are donna and larry ralston of englewood colorado
whoever finds this please make an attempt to get this to them
be sure of it
i would appreciate it
he takes long blinks and seems to avoid looking at himself though the screen is facing him
he looks alarmed and wide eyed startled in contrast to his slow slurred delivery
i was hiking blue john canyon yesterday
and this happened
he pulls the camera round to show where his forearm and wrist disappear into the horrifyingly skinny gap between the chockstone and the wall
as he does that we flashes of the accident almost in silhouette like an animatic side view
it freezes just before the moment of entombment
what youre looking at there is my arm going into the rock
and there it is stuck
its been without circulation for hours
its pretty well gone
if the colour doesnt come across on the video its grey and blue
im in deep stuff
so i have very little water
he cant help look in the camera towards those who know what that means in this place
yeah i have about a third of a litre left
he picks up the water bottle and shakes it for the camera
different angle on the freeze frame
so the way i see it
theres kind of four things happening here
i tried to move it with some rigging
and i tried chipping away at the rock
i think part of the problem is is that my hand is actually supporting the rock
which means every time i chip away the rock moves a bit and settles onto my hand again
i cant feel it happening but microscopically it seems to be because the little gap over there between the rock and the wall seems to be getting smaller
and this chockstone is the hardest thing here
a breeze slides through the canyon and he shudders involuntarily for five seconds
so the third thing left was to cut my arm off
i dont know whether i could do that but its pretty much suicide
its four hours to my vehicle that way and with very difficult climbing with one hand and the bike is like two two and a half hours that way but
fourth class climbing
which i think will be probably impossible with one hand
between the blood loss and the dehydration i think i would die if i cut off my arm
which means im waiting for someone to come along
he summons up the guts to let the evidence out
i didnt tell anyone where i was going and i didnt leave a note on the truck
the video whirrs on until he suddenly looks straight into the lens
he hears voices
we see his reaction to this sound through the video message
he puts the camera down and listens
people descending at the s log
he can hear them
he screams and screams and screams and then he stops
he listens again
the noise is there still
again he screams and screams
breathing hard heart racing he listens again
the noise is still there unchanged
he knows now its not people
they would have heard him
he looks above and behind and sees a kangaroo rat disappearing scuffling behind a chockstone
he stops staring at the camera still recording
he picks it up rewinds and
re runs the sound of him screaming for help
we just see an arbitrary view of the rock and sky on the video camera maybe with a bit of elbow but we hear his desperation screaming at no one
distorting on the tiny speaker
he stops it
the sound of his absolute helplessness and need freaks him out and threatens absolute despair
no ones coming aron
he rewinds to the end of the message and erases his futile calls for help
we sense him in the cab but were not inside with him yet
music loud and pulsing as we travel towards the inflatable scooby doo
its ft tall powered by a mini generator
aron swerves to affect the figure which buckles and flaps in his after draft
we stay with the dancing figure as his truck drives away into the landscape
the generator fan rattles on as the booming bass of the truck fades
you can see him thinking
will the girls go to the party
were now high above the desert and in the time lapse we see the soft grey endless line of darkness cross right to left a flashing strobe ing light arons
head lamp bouncing back and forth off the canyon walls but also as he continues to chip away
jump cutting strobe lit as though by flash of aron madly dressing for the night
we see the thermometer on his watch falling down and down from below
the whole thing is almost like stop frame animation
he cannibalizes everything he can using his knife his teeth he tears holes in a cloth camera bag hes frantically paced to occupy himself to pass time to create heat
from energy but he has to be careful not to stab himself in the eye
he thrusts his left arm into the newly fashioned sleeve pulling it up with his teeth
purple webbing around his right arm the insulated camelbak protects his upper arm from the chilling canyon wall
yellow webbing wraps a grocery bag that held the burritos round his upper right bicep
the dirty green and yellow ropes are curled round his legs like pythons
finally he puts his head inside the rope bag
its plastic inside and although its black the light from his head lamp suddenly lights him up alarmingly as we go inside with him
he looks like a multi coloured version of the michelin man only much thinner
he laughs as though he can see how ludicrous he looks
we return to normal speed as he turns the light off
black but we can hear his breathing close as in a space suit
god i am praying to you for guidance
im trapped in blue john canyon you probably know that and i dont know what i am supposed to do
ive tried everything i can think of
i need some new ideas
please show me a sign
pause just his breath
he switches on the head lamp and the inside of the bag explodes with light
theres enough light for any kind of heaven but its just aron in blue john canyon
he looks around his bag
only his breathing to listen to
ok then god since youre apparently busy devil if youre listening i need some help here
ill trade you my arm my soul whatever you want
just get me out of here
you want me never to climb again i can give that up
just show me the dotted line
ungg gggu ggga gggngh
his throat uncontrollably shudders and splutters as his teeth rattle with cold suddenly
it does sound like a demonic fit from the multi coloured headless man
not very funny
aron leaves work at no point do we see aron
hes there you sense him in reflective surfaces his arms particularly his right one and his feet occasionally come into shot
its not a strict p
v more like over the shoulder but without much shoulder
what you doin
still not sure
ill see you tuesday
have a good one
in huge luminous figures
he pulls his bag off and pulls his water bottle out of the ground where he has half buried it
it wont open
he cant unscrew it
he mutters cursing himself for tightening the lid too much
he puts it between his teeth and levers with his head but nothing
is his strength vanishing so quickly
he looks at his puffy left hand
theres a tremble in it
he shakes it to get rid of the tremble and jams the bottle between his legs
he uses a bit of cloth to give his hand better purchase on the top
were tight on the neck of the bottle as it releases finally and he lifts it slowly almost ceremonially
controlling the tilt a half mouthful of water slides onto his tongue
he tilts the bottle back towards upright but not the whole way
circulating the splash of water around his mouth
the bottle neck stares at aron
his eyes staring at the bottle neck
he still holds the water in his mouth as he rewinds the top onto the bottle and reburies it in the sand to stop any evaporation
he moves to pop his contact lenses into his mouth and wash them in the moisture
first one then the other as we
the images shift with the lens change back to his apartment daylight we sense him though hes probably in the shower
his ansaphone clicks in
aron its mom
hoping to catch you
dads in new york so itll be a quiet weekend
aron is clearly there but cant answer
lots of love
in front of his bathroom mirror hes slipping his lenses in for the day
it looks like the man who fell to earth
huge close ups that freak people out whove never worn lenses
mirror shots and lots of short soft focus
we hear a girl and a guy somewhere in the apartment
he closes the door
girl shouts that was your mom
and your dad called
see you next week
oh and rana called
he is absolutely still
flies buzz around him
indeterminate time passes
massive c u of an ant
huge high definition image more like a jcb digger than an insect and then more of them and all moving towards the mosquitoes which hover and land near the real
he watches them devour him and then he clears them away from his hand
suddenly breaks and hes busy now well before sunrise
in the grey white soft morning he is involved in recycling his overnight insulation gear into a crude lift and pulley
obsessive inventive analytical he constantly adjusts and adds and subtracts and cannibalizes
undoing and tieing knots with his teeth and hand
each time nothing happens to the rock
but each time he doesnt stop
he tries again and again and again looping and re looping throwing and catching ropes creating footholds and bouncing in them with his foot his knees his ass
finally he stops
he looks down
for a moment its as though he will cry
he looks up to where he came from and suddenly were moving retracing his journey at increasing and eventually staggering speed
through the slot canyon up and into the blazing light across the desert paths past his chained up bicycle and back to his truck waiting at the side of the
but we dont stop
we crash into the back of the truck and there lying on its side is an almost full bottle of gatorade and then theres a grapefruit and another one and
theyve got sparkly condensation on them like advertising spritzer mist all over them
and a water bottle and an orange
and high energy snack bars and another orange
the fruit seems to roll around the empty truck
the gatorade lies on its side and the liquid slaps slowly backward and forward like a lava lamp
the liquid literally bulges with wetness moisture texture and we
snap back to arons face
aron trying not to look at himself its freaking me out looking at myself so i hope you guys are ok with this we can see images of him when
we go behind the balanced video on the rock as he has deliberately turned the screen away from himself
its monday all day bummer
i spent the morning trying to create a system ration and lift the boulder but friction between the rope and carabiners is dissipating every bit of force i apply
all its good for is sitting in
we see a more objective view of his mornings activities as he describes them
we see him below us as the raven flies between us and him
theres a raven flies overhead i clocked it at
ill bet its there tomorrow too
ill film it for you tomorrow we see the raven and we see him check his watch
i have about one hundred and fifty millilitres of water left
thats four ounces
i cant believe it but i peed twice today within a few minutes of each other
how is this possible
its two days since i peed im dehydrated and i had to go so quickly i forgot to save the first
i saved the second in the camelbak
will i drink it
it smells foul and hot but itll settle
and i can chill it in the sand in the night
its like polar winter here for nine hours
we see his precious bottle of water
it looks back at him
next to it is the camelbak of his stored urine
no number twos
which will disappoint my insect friends
theyre gonna have to wait
the sunlight appears down here for a few hours
i get minutes of it at
and apart from chipping away uselessly at this rock thats pretty much my morning routine
aron is deathly still as we travel towards him with the dagger of light
his leg is stretched out and the only movement is the change of leg halfway through
he stays in shot throughout getting bigger and then smaller as the light approaches and recedes the sliver of light leaves the canyon
i keep chipping at the rock but just to generate warmth and give me something to do
i think its making it worse
i know its settling more on my arm as i remove material from it
the area where i chipped flakes off yesterday has already rotated down onto my arm
i cant feel anything
so i made a great tourniquet and i tried to cut it off
we see him pull the elastic neoprene tubing insulation from the camelbak
its stretchy supple and strong and emerges like a thin snake
he wraps the black neoprene around his right forearm inches below his elbow
simple overhand knot tightened with his teeth
nd knot rd knot clips the neoprene with a carabiner and twists times tight
now real pain in his right arm
weird smile at the success
the skin colour separates fish belly white below the tourniquet and bright red bunched up crushes of flesh between the elbow and the tourniquet
he takes out the multi tool and switches to the long blade
looks at it
then he presses the blade and draws it quickly across his forearm
repeats it harder
no cut no blood nothing
he switches to the short knife and saws viciously at the same point
he releases the tourniquet and as the blood flow returns a series of angry red lines establish themselves where he was sawing
he looks at them
pathetic aron pathetic
the blades are too blunt even to break the skin
i guess thats the chipping
its not even a proper leatherman
its a knock off one we got free in a gift pack with a torch
mom gave it to me
sonja im very proud of you
i didnt get to hear firsthand how your championships went but i heard from mom that you placed very well at the national competitions that you were tenth overall in
speech and debate in the nation
hot damn girl
im very proud of you
not just for that but for who you are
he looks directly in the lens for the first time
i can imagine you in your living room looking back at me
we see his sister on her living room sofa
the sofa sits in the open section of the canyon
ive been thinking about what my friend rob in aspen says to me several
several times that confusingly its not what you do but who you are
i kind of got hung up on that a lot because i always thought who i was was very much wrapped up with what i did
that i was happy because of the things that i did that made me happy
if things you do make you happy then they can also make you unhappy
i think thats why i found myself being as ambitious and energetic the wind interrupts him and he shivers
mutters bitterly its cold
this place is an ice box at night
and killing winds
he struggles to complete the sense of the to do all the outings that i did
as he loses track of what hes saying and then catches up the canyon has become noticeably darker
i did want to say on the logistical side of things i have some american express insurance that should cover costs of the recovery operation when that does happen
bank account balances should take care of my credit card debts
youll have to sell my house mom and dad
possession wise i dont know if sonja can use my computer and video camera
hes interrupted by a sudden realization as he looks first one way up the canyon and then the other
he looks up at the sky above
theres an angry looking black motherfucker of a cloud
a massive crack of noise like the land has split
his eyes staring up unblinking the corridor of light above him reflected in is contact lenses like mirrors
suddenly a drop of water hits his eye like an invisible bomb dropping from the sky
were many miles away the dust spits as though hit by silent bullet tracer fire
raindrops gathering and multiplying soaking and bouncing off the desert floor they skim and slip into a groove and then another the slit instantly fills and water drops crash on
the new surface
the spillage spreads and fills everything near it
we tilt up the sky is furious black and murderous
lightning arcs across hundreds of miles
arons sky darkens above him
instantly plunging him into a dark violet nether light
he looks up the canyon as he pulls at his arm in panic and tries to gather his laid out possessions into his backpack
simultaneously he opens his mouth to gather any drops he can into his parched throat
a channel fills now as the grooves spill and multiply
the water poured from above appears everywhere visibility is virtually gone whether its through mist or darkness its impossible to tell
another channel explodes like a volcanic surging mass in every direction
the camera literally slips and slides as the water now seems to take a direction towards deeper gulleys looking for something to fill for somewhere to escape to
the floor of the desert becomes a river careering towards the slot canyons
now carrying debris with it the water cascades into the natural pipe work of the desert
we see the s log from below as someone seems to pour unimaginable tons of water over the lips of the canyon above it
the walls glisten with force as the canyon becomes a ft wall of churning mud hurtling towards the chockstones
the smaller ones are picked up and tossed downstream smashing and breaking on the bigger ones
we can see aron in the distance pulling at his arm
without time to watch its journey towards him it seems to skip time and hit him like a tsunami under surging the initial push of water on the floor
in an instant it smashes into his chest scattering all of his possessions as he still tries to grab them
he pushes and pulls trying to gain height but is underwater almost immediately
he tries to take a huge suck of air before hes submerged but even that is compromised by water
we hear him choke and he disappears into the liquid wall of mud
were with him underwater
hes trying to switch his light on
we can see almost nothing in this washing machine of churning slush and debris and malevolent water
the light flicks on
he can see his arm and the rock
suddenly the water lifts the chockstone and his arm releases
he pulls it towards him luminous deathly white in the mud and flat and too big
were close on arons face at last free but now suffocating in darkness
aron gasps and throws his night bag off his head and to the floor
hes sweating and gasping thumped alert but
the canyon is dry as mars
he tries to control his breathing
head down sweat drips onto his arm he licks it off and lifts his head a sudden shiver looks at his watch
the display changes from
he cant believe so little time has passed
hes only just closed his eyes
its going to be a long night
the two bottles stand looking at him
he goes back in the head bag and we go with him
he holds the video camera at waist height and switches it to playback
he rewinds through his messages
stops switches off playback and rewinds the blue lcd screen to save battery
the light is surreal soft lcd hell
time rewinding hurtling backwards
megan and kristi
they clamber out in wet clothes its from after their first jumps
we see all three of them climb and fall and get out of the water and climb and fall smashing into the azure water
their faces are dripping wet beaming mad screaming and howling completely natural children really on their first helter skelter big dipper
he rewinds this time in vision
kristis bra and pants are soaking
megans top cascades water as she rises out of the water
for aron the volume of his and their shouting is deafening and the first human sounds he has heard for days
he watches staring laughing not laughing staring eyes tearing in self pity
theres water joy beautiful girls happiness sensuality company freedom
he looks at the picture and then into the bag
his breathing is hard pronounced
he carefully tells himself
he sees the moisture on the inside of the bag condensation
he licks it with his sticky tongue twice three times
he looks back at the lcd screen
the lcd looks back at him
he kills the image and snaps it shut
he emerges from the bag
and looks at the bottle
he takes the camelbak and saying
see you later
swallows quickly spoons of urine without disturbing the sediment
tangy and bitter the saltiness makes him wince
were in his truck again but this time over his shoulder and we can see the scooby doo figure dancing in the distance
its now lit up too as night is falling and were coming at it from the other direction
as he gets to it he swerves and follows its guide to the party
jump cut pulling up at the party
jump cut inside its nice full of ordinary decent people though no one acknowledges aron as we stay attached to his shoulder
theres a mini scooby doo dancing in the main room and theres a light early party atmosphere
aron searches for the girls approaching any cluster to see which girls they contain
rana is there but doesnt acknowledge him
theres no megan or kristi anywhere and we finally settle on the bar drinks table where there is an ocean of all kinds of drink
and melting ice in huge buckets with bottles of beer floating around in them
and orange juice and popsicles
and melon and lemon and lime
and grapefruit and oranges for margaritas are filling frosted glasses
during the ritual we
aron ducks out of his head bag and shakes his water bottle
something he always does to check the sound of real water
to make sure he hasnt drunk it all without knowing
he opens tilts and holds as always and then ritualistically removes his contact lenses and washes them in his mouth
suddenly a shiver tears across him like an attack dog
he coughs a lens out and as he tries to catch it before it goes into the sand he tips the bottle in his lap
he hasnt put the top on fully
it goes horizontal on his shorts and a leak of the sacred fluid darkens his tan shorts
he whips it upright
furious at himself fuck a nut aron
pay fucking attention look what you did
he stares at the stain with all the dirt on his shorts its already paste
he screws the lid on slowly and can barely be bothered to lift his lens into his mouth
with difficulty he puts the murky lens back in his bloody eye
the image shifts with the lens to night everything short focus
only one thing at a time clear everything else diffuse
no idea where we are
we come over arons shoulder and hes clearly in the deep background of a vehicle
in front of him a half a dozen of his friends boys and girls
and rana excitedly chatting
though we can hear nothing
gradually it becomes clear its night outside
they are all undressing in their seats until all are butt naked
the tone we cant hear is clearly more infantile than sexual
were beginning to see theres a ferocious blizzard outside
and we appear to be badly exposed to it
up a mountain on the crest of a high road
snow hail swirls savagely around all sides of the truck
we remain inside
its warm the heater blows
they prepare themselves for a mutual signal press their window buttons
all the windows open and a blizzard explodes inside the vehicle
one shot outside povs naked arms out the windows shaking and saluting the storm
their crazy happy faces through the windscreen as the weather invades the vehicle
aron very still listens to their screams
he looks at his knife dangling from his wrist by the shoelace
hundreds of miles of canyon sunrise
the inner canyons change from dark umbers and black shadows to immense bands of pastel yellow white green and a hundred shades of red a hallucinogenic movement towards light
good morning america
theres a chorus of good mornings from american tv radio shows
literally dozens of them from texas to oregon massachusetts to the carolinas
aron joins the morning chorus
good morning everyone
its tuesday morning in bj canyon
the weather is great
i figure by now that leona my housemate hi leona
has missed me hopefully since i didnt show up last night
another hour and a half theyll miss me for not showing up for work
hi brion at work
best case scenario is they notify the police and after a hour hold they file a report a missing persons report
which means noon tomorrow its official that im gone
i do still have the tiniest bit of water left
well actually ive resorted
ive had a couple pretty good gulps of urine that i saved in my camelbak
i sorta let it distill
it tastes like hell
so its hours since i left on my bike from horseshoe trailhead during which time i have consumed liters of water and a couple mouthfuls of piss
did i say the weather is great
well it is
though flash floods potential is still present
theres prong major canyons upstream from me that all converge in this foot wide gap where i am
the rock i pulled down on top of me it was put there by flood
still id get a drink
he shudders its ridiculous
then composes himself during a long blink and looks straight at the camera
mom dad i really love you guys
i wanted to take this time to say the times weve spent together have been awesome
i havent appreciated you in my own heart the way i know i could
mom i love you
i wish id returned all of your calls ever
i really have lived this last year
i wish i had learned some lessons more astutely more rapidly than i did
i love you
ill always be with you
switches off the camera
he charges into setting up the haul system again
much quicker this time
he clears the rope the rock of his possessions and puts his sunglasses on
ready for lift off
he bounces his full weight in the stirrups and pulls on the haul line
it looks a better set up
come on move dammit
and stares directly at the knife below him
not even the insects
the knife stares back
without warning he suddenly tourniquets his arm again
twice around the fore arm knotted twice and clipped with a carabiner that he twists times
he secures the fix by attaching the purple webbing
looks to his watch
he folds open the knife grasps it in his fist and picking a spot just above the rocks grip on his right wrist he hesitates and then violently plunges the
blade into his arm up to the hilt
he lets go leaving the knife embedded
he swoons and stares at it
he slowly grasps the tool more firmly and wriggles it slightly the blade connects with something hard
he taps the knife down and feels it knocking on the radius of his upper forearm bone
he puts his ear close and we can hear the little thocking sound
whoa thats the bone
he pulls the knife out opening the wound more
theres barely any blood
he pokes at the gash with the tool
he can see the epidermis thick and leathery rough
yellow fatty tissue under the skin in a membrane layer around the muscle
he thocks thocks again and some blood finally seeps out and blocks his view
he pulls the knife out and thinks
hes sweating and puts the tool on top of the chockstone
he immediately pulls up his water bottle and stares into it
with a little shake he opens it and drinks it all gulping open throated
he shakes any last drop down and runs his tongue up into the neck
he screws the lid back on and loosens the tourniquet
theres no discernible increase in blood loss
he picks up the video again
this next part may not be for all viewers at home
its a little after eight
at precisely eight oclock i took my last sip of clean water
hide your eyes mom
he pans across the boulder and zooms in on the wound smattered with bright red blood
i made an attempt a short career in surgery as it turned out those knives are just not anywhere close to the task
ive got about an inch wide gash in my arm that goes about a half inch deep
i cut down through the skin and the fatty tissue and through some of the muscle
i think i cut a tendon but im not sure
ill never saw through the bones with this knife
i tried anyways
it really just didnt go well
the tourniquet is relaxed at this point
which actually is a little bothersome considering im not bleeding that bad barely at all
its so weird
youd expect to definitely see more pulsing and bleeding but oh well
im really fucked now
im out of water
stops the video and rips a section of his t shirt to make an impromptu bandage to cover the wound
as he ties it with his teeth theres a rush of someone elses noise the swat of wings
he grabs the camera just in time to catch the very end of the ravens flight ft above his head
shit missed it
hes late and i still missed it
we can hear his heart racing
he holds his left hand to it hoping to calm it down
like the beginning there are thousands of fans filling the screen people everywhere maybe holding lighters
and again like the beginning the screen splits into
the rest of tuesday and night and wednesday and night play out through the triptych
repetition is used to create a trippy sense of losing coherence sometimes theres arons doing the same thing
it could be consecutive days or hes forgotten
at key moments it resolves to one image and then back again
things seem to loop and his close ups almost seem to watch the loops happening again and again
this is particularly true inside the head bag at night
when his light is switched on its bleached and monstrously overlit like cruel hd close up his disintegration is terrifying
when its off we establish a night vision of green of blue that allows us to witness him in hiding
the images sometimes of himself also play out on the interior surface of the bag
the effect is like wraparound imax multi screen technicolor
aron has his headphones on ext
stadium crowd listening to the live concert again
the laser in the cd the crowd smears skips
dragged and distorted
its been damaged by the time in the numbers skip on the the sand
as they stop
aron falls into the canyon
beyond the foot
in the sunlight aron falls again into the huge figures
we dont canyon replayed in slower see above waist motion v
o here he is height
someone aron lifts a carrying huge huge rock onto office water his shoulder dispensers by and heaves it their necks walks to crash on into the canyon the chockstone he
walks up to aron it shatters and puts them down into dust
his side and leaves
its like aron quarry mining
thanks he finds a adverts up etc
some putt sized televised some billboard rock and some radio pull tab cans begins split and spit slurpees hammering with grapefruit juice oj that popsicles
but he carries on
temperature shivers like huge a fit teeth figures chattering a figure starts body with a a small fire to furious comfort aron
perfect for bacon and beans
he pisses again
aron huge luminous figures on theres the i cant believe the inside of the black interior scooby this
doo waving at a decants the table in front sediment out of v
o there you are of it piled to camelbak
the creaking point stench of the with margaritas sediment makes the excess runs him retch and jerk down the table away
where is all legs
this coming from
we see it reflected that shit stinks on his eyeball the eyelid rustles back and forward
finished he tucks back in but video footage during this we theres a small aron rambling on video see pictures
aron only sometimes coherent unremarkable you can shake tom thanks for the lovely natural and you can dance fire last night
but the last my friend rob in aspen ones of erik drop is in the says to me several
jon kristi pants of pee frequently
several matt brent on his shorts
times confusingly gary judson int
rob in canyon on sofa
rachel angie rob its not what you do some take but who you are
their turn on erik rana the sofa in sonja jean marc the canyon soha craig aron falls brandon chip one of the things again the norm im learning here is
that i accident didnt enjoy peoples re runs in company that i was with silhouette enough or as much as i could have
a lot of really good people have spent time with me
very often i tend to ignore or dismiss their presence in seeking the he eats the essence of their presence
last bite of did that make sense
down with a swig of urine he switches off and applies winces and lip balm
aron he looks at it and bites a thats it
masticates it on im on the and on
urine diet now
well the chockstone its no waits and arons slurpee
foot kicks and then lands and they fall together
the raven flies
the accident runs in aron watches reverse the raven away desultory a slit of light in blackness reveals jon in work clothes
aron licks a light switch flicks on and moisture thin metal shelves full of condensation cleaning supplies appear he takes shots from inside the on sides industrial mop of himself
his head aron in his canyon gear with his still
lamp blinks right arm out of focus
camera and of unreliably
tries to knock on door with his hand and left arm
jon stops him and of the light indicates it wont do any in the canyon
o where are good
he takes one you going
with the flash video footage at night in aron im holding on but the canyon
its really slowing down and one inside the time is going really the bag slow but my heart rate is blinding int
going like crazy we hear himself
the were in the it pounding in contrast spots in his doorway of a to his slurring delivery eyes bleed garage with i swear its like x what across into
friends in the it should be
other shots background gathered and change around rana who colour
is working on one rewinded video of the giant megan and kristi easter island masks and back through for burning man
his life in the she chats away canyon and then carefree some of him shes in baggy climbing in snow dungarees or that existed on overalls with her the tape
triumphant hair falling around pose on top of the icy her face out of its wonder
all ice picks hairband
she brushes and gore tex
it back and flecks of plaster of paris dust her skin
she notices aron
o hes over here rana there you are
she shouts to someone rana here he is
mum and dad sitting on sofa
sofa sitting in canyon he imagines in front of him flash floods his head in of light the dagger of sunlight
ranas face is remaining in huge on the inside the light
an of his head bag smiling accelerating at him
her face in huge carousel of scale compared to his head
breathing close but shallow and rasping
god its aron again
i still need some help
its getting bad here
im out of water and food
give me the strength not to do anything against myself
i want to see this through whatever
a rumbling thunderous sound grows and the inside of the bag begins to bear the image of the top of the canyon at dawn but crumpled like paper creased like
the bag but stretched across screens
the noise grows and grows
when it can get no louder obscuring the light on a horse leaps the ft gap his face once theyve at the top of the canyon
gone and only dust its followed by dozens of falling lightly is horses stampeding across his evidence then
the raven beats its wings across the canyon
we tilt down the wall still reflected on inside of bag to see aron completing his obit
scratched on wall of canyon aron oct apr rip
as we reverse back on aron in the canyon theres a burst of light and color beyond him and on the sofa in the canyon a little boy sits
hes blond about and in a red polo shirt
he looks like aron
aron walks towards him the sunlight hits his face like a train and aron looks up to it but keeps moving towards the boy walking downhill towards the sofa
the boy leaps off the sofa and comes running to aron
he scoops the boy up with his left arm and balances him around his shoulders with his right handed stump
the boy holds arons arms in his little hands and they prance around the sofa they giggle and shout playing bulls giraffes elephants jousting knights pretending to walk downhill behind
like any father in any park
a perfect pop song blondie maybe plays in the distance
like any father in any park
aron watches the image begin to fade
he switches on the light but its low and feeble
as the images on the inside of the bag fade so too does arons lamp
he tries to warm it up but it fades to black
he holds his breath
its strangely still even by the canyons standards
he peeks out from his head bag his contacts are cloudy and sore to blink
you can hear him blink
eye socket rasping against eyeball
the head lolls like hes lost control of the neck muscles
his tongue rasps as he flexes his mouth to prevent sealing
thursday may st
he looks at his obituary on the wall
out of date
waits for the raven
its tough looking at him
so long without water
the dehydration is frightening
no raven today
if you still want me to play at your wedding
theres a tape in a box in the basement of mom and dads lounge
its me or
we hear the music
mozart beethoven bach chopin he can hear it as he played it until
there was a little boy and he looked like my cousin charlie but he was too young
and i dont want to die
but i really dont know what to do
quietly deadly i did this aron
i created this
the boulder did what it was here to do
it was waiting for me but it did the only natural thing it could do
i chose to come here i chose to do this descent by myself
i chose not to tell anyone where i was going
i chose to turn away from the women who were there to keep me from getting in this trouble
i wanted it to be like this
look how far i came to find this spot
its not that im getting what i deserve im getting what i wanted
hes empty now
he clicks the camera shut and puts it away
he looks at his good hand
its swollen and angry red like an inflated prosthetic on top and around of his real hand
he takes off his shoe and pulls the sock over his hand to cushion his palm and picks up the black rounded hammer rock again
ignoring the pain he starts hammering at the rock surface
i hate this rock
the rage blooms purple in his mind
i hate it
his face swells with anger nostrils flaring
i hate this fucking canyon
a small mushroom cloud of pulverized grit and dust erupts each time
i hate this cold slab pressing me against this damp fucking wall
smash smash smash
i know theres water near coz of these fucking mosquitoes
the sock quickly disintegrates with friction as he hammers and hammers
i hate this fucking mess
finally he stops but his fingers are paralyzed fused rigid around the rock
he pulls them off with his teeth and the stone drops to his feet
theres a thick layer of dust across the top of the stone and his right arm
he tries to blow it away
tired its too thick and hes too dehydrated
he picks up his knife and using this starts sweeping the grit off his thumb
as he cleans up he accidentally rips away a thin piece of decayed flesh
it peels back a long way like a skin of boiled milk
the insects start to gather
he pokes the thumb with the stubbed point of the blade
on the second prod the blade punctures the epidermis like soft butter
there is a clear hiss as gases escape
the stench is death
he looks at the gangrene attached to him poisoning him
get rid of it aron its dead its garbage
he drops to his haunches but the webbing stops him at his waist
he detaches it and drops down again almost able to squat
his trapped arm is the only thing preventing that
his face is suddenly open
he pushes and pushes with his left hand under the boulder to create maximum downward force on his right arm
hard harder harder
it looks insane unnatural and painful but he says nothing
like a gunshot in the canyon the bone breaks
the sound ricochets
he rises and sees the bone pushing up violently against the skin
he feels it
its a serrated but clean successful break
still he says nothing
now he humps his body up and over the chockstone smearing his feet one with a shoe one without against the wall he pushes grabbing further and further round the
dark side of the chockstone pulling with a silent furious intensity
hard then harder and harder
a second gun shot smashes around the canyon
hes sweating heavily and yet euphoric possessed
he checks the underneath of the arm
its broken too
around the same place
he can rotate his forearm like a shaft inside a housing
giving himself no time to wake up he grabs the knife looks at the watch
ok aron here we go
youre in it now
he pushes the knife hard to the hilt in between veins on his wrist
fuck knows where the sweat is coming from but its pouring out of him
sawing downwards he makes as large a hole as he can without tearing any of the noodle like veins
he puts the knife in his teeth and pokes his left forefinger and thumb inside his right arm
like a mechanic he looks to analyse and then he works by feel only
his sweat falls on his knife mixing with the blood
he pulls muscle nearer the surface allowing his knife to slice and pare away at a pinky finger sized fragment bit by bit
it takes a dozen actions each time the knife goes back to his teeth
theres not a lot of blood
but he keeps working and working
once the blood increases he puts the knife down on top of the rock and swiftly ties his tourniquet
hes silent refusing to verbalize the pain
he cant cut the tendon no matter how hard he slices
but nothing will stop his addiction to surgery now
he folds in and swaps the blade for the pliers
he uses them to bite into an edge of the yellowy tendon
then squeezing and twisting he tears away a fragment
finally he finishes the tendon
he returns to the knife
finally all that remains inside is a pale white strand
like swollen angel hair pasta
he touches it with the knife edge
he explodes internally with vocal pain through gritted teeth
the first time he has made any sound during the surgery
but its like hes been taser ed hes stunned still for a minute he looks at it
and the thin swollen wire of his own nerve looks back at him
for the final time he asks himself can you do this
he puts the knife in and pulls it toward him an inch two inches it lengthens like pulling a guitar string
unimaginable pain builds in his whole body like hes pushing his arm into a cauldron of magma
its difficult to tell because everything is so tight and claustrophobic but maybe the boy is there intermittently riding his shoulders slipping across and around him or obstructed by the
boulder and stopped from getting to aron until it breaks
he shudders in shock and drops everything for minutes
his head lolls forward dripping
his mind swarming with trauma
and then hes back on the last action stretching the skin of his outer wrist tight and sawing the blade into the wall
its a piece of gristle on a cutting board
everything now is forcing us towards the boulder cramping us in with him impossibly close hes sweating and heaving his vision blurring with tears his contacts failing his breath impossibly
dry and rasping and then as simply as this all began his shoulders open and hes free
he staggers back one two three steps away from his arm
his head swarming with colours swooning overpowering
he stares at his obituary as hes born again
his feet stagger under him like a new foal an involuntary dance we see colours bleeding and blending in his p
s and the colours invade our shots of him
spitting out this declaration at the rock
am hes busy packaging his stump in the plastic grocery sack and then wrapping that with the yellow webbing he wore as a chocker to keep his neck warm in
he stuffs the repackaged arm into the empty camelbak backpack and throws the straps over his neck to hold the arm in a makeshift sling
packs his bag water reservoir full bottle of shiny urine video pocket knife
grabs his climbing rope messy and knotted from its use as insulation and heads off down the canyon
stops almost immediately and hesitates for a beat
to take photos on his still camera of the rock and his hand
and now the motion and energy and life force of the action movie returns
its like ray liottas final day in goodfellas relentless frustrating pressure of life again now hes free from his tomb
deeper and deeper down and down into the swirling scoops of the sandstone
couple of difficult manoeuvres lots of slipping and bumping despite his best effort occasionally his right shoulder takes the brunt and he stops winces and grunts thru the pain
but on he goes ft of the rope trailing behind him
as we follow its progress snaking after him we see specs of blood on the lower walls
the canyon becomes a chute increasingly steep in which he ignores the shrinking daylight above because he has another target the twists and turns of the curricles of sedimented sandstone
lead to a soft glow red translucent growing and growing in intensity
he pushes forward the tail of rope whipping faster and faster along the walls and floor
finally we burst into the dazzling midday sun on a rock shelf halfway up a sheer walled amphitheatre ft high
the scale of the slated cliff face opposite is breathtaking the dazzling sunlight poaches the air he sucks in and burns his dry eyes
he sees for the first time in his new life green
the deep green of a healthy ft tree below him and to his left and he knows
he looks for the bolts drilled into the rock and he knows
now he can look down
right to the edge of vertiginous drop and there below is a puddle of shallow turgid water
he wanted it to be there and now hes mesmerized by it
a pair of swifts leave the tree and zig zag up and around him
he wobbles and has to stop himself lunging head first over the precipice
instead he drops to the bolts and kisses them like the pope arriving in a foreign land
unravelling the rope of its knots hes baking in blazing
he cant go yet every knot must be undone pulled open between his teeth and his hand
but hell die if he cant have moisture
he tips the saved urine over himself and licking and retching simultaneously he suddenly stops and listens
he can hear a shuffling a zip zip
the rope is uncoiling over the ledge
he put it down to drink
picking up speed the more it falls theres only a few feet left
he lunges across the ledge and catches it just in time
that was his future disappearing over the ledge
were far below storeys and see him inch over the edge
somethings not right
its a difficult overhang and hes awkward and vulnerable with only one useful arm
his bad arm catches horribly on the lip of the ledge
suddenly he starts coming fast faster and then hideously much too fast accelerating out of control and smashing into the water with deadly force
were underneath deep in the pool and he crashes in an explosive cascade of air forced into the water
his feet gently touch the sandy floor ft to the side of the pool
hes a great climber and even in his present condition has perfectly executed the descent
and the pool is a puddle swimming with dead leaves and insects inches deep at most
he falls on it with his bottles filling them and dipping his mouth into the water he washes his head drinks and fills drinks and gargles and drinks again insects
leaves tadpoles everything
blood splashes in beside him so out comes his map again as he plots his way out
he sees a great goose necked avenue before him bending to the right
checking the map
theres a long way to go and hes small nothing in this landscape
he walks shedding any weight that might reduce how long he can keep going his equipment carabiners headphones his harness left like a spent snake skin behind him
he keeps to the shadows of the huge monument valley like cliffs when he can
finally he comes to the great gallery that we saw in the opening titles
a ft huge wall with dozens of broad shouldered figures painted to enormous scale in all shades of tan and maroon
they seem to stare back at him
he salutes them in his own way and continues
he banks left beneath a colossal alcove high up in the cliff face and makes to the flattest ground theres no shade to hide in here
yards ahead aliens are walking away from him
tall one shorter
all with elongated bodies and tiny heads shimmering in the heat
he goes to shout but his voice catches
then a feeble effort is lost in the vast scale of the canyon
the figures walk on bending and disappearing in the light
he digs deep
and the figures turn
theres a terrible pause of uncertainty on both sides and then he pushes out another heartbreaking the figures begin to run towards him
we watch his face in close up as they come
if tears come then now they come at the sight of humans
he mutters to himself
hang in there aron
at they get closer he summons a surge of energy from somewhere
my name is aron ralston
i was trapped by a boulder on saturday and ive been without food and water for days
i cut my arm off this morning to get free and ive lost a lot of blood
i need medical attention
theres a pause as they look at this refugee from a low budget horror movie
he hungrily eyes the water bottles attached to their waist bands
this gives them a way in to his world
the moment is broken by their offering him their water
it pours down his throat bypassing the swallow mechanism
eriks english is almost perfect although accented and without humour
his family sit beside him on comfortable chairs in a tv studio
they are very pleased to we are the mejers from holland
at the start of the trailhead we talked to a ranger who told us about a car that was parked in the area already for several days and that the
owner might be missing in the canyon
we joked that we would keep our eyes open and that we would try to find him
after a hike of
kilometres to the great gallery indian rock art where we took some pictures we returned and suddenly heard a noise behind us and after that a voice that cried help
i need help
monique and i immediately realized that this had to be the missing person
we didnt find him he found us
we gave him our water and oreos
back now live as aron wolfs down the cookies and organises the mejers in a series of jump cuts pushing us through the final stages hes brutally practical
we are the mejers from holland
you should stop and rest
no we need to keep hiking
we need a helicopter who can run fastest
you go now fast
monique runs ahead with andy her son
they told us you were here
who told you
the police at the parking lot do you have a phone
theres no signal for miles
nobody for days and then like london buses another couple appears
they too are confronted by do you have a cell phone
i have some medical training
is it ok for me to drink so much water
sure so long as it doesnt make you vomit
aron drinks more and more he overhears
make sure he doesnt pass out
i gotta stop and empty my shoes
youll have to tie my shoe lace
as he sits his head slumps forward
hes absolutely motionless
wayne and erik try to talk to him but he can barely hear them
a pop song spins round and round distantly
he strains to pull his head up and staring drops forward to his knees
there it is
filling his vision like a god
whirling screaming in front of him dust blasting him as he kneels
a strange slightly formal man pops out of the helicopter
he almost looks like hes part of the matrix
are you aron
yes i am
can i get a lift
aron looks at the beautiful white leather seat before he gets in the back of the helicopter
its a startling contrast to his frankenstein and even now its not lost on him
im gonna make a terrible mess of your seat
just get in buddy
were all looking for you
the helicopter sucks upwards into the sky leaving wayne monique andy and erik far below
a figure dives in pulling strong breast strokes down and towards us
its aron fully recovered after surgery
eyes open he pulls and pulls down through crystal clear oxygenated water
as the helicopter and gurney staff transfer him into the medic room hes surrounded by vertical giants as he lies horizontal for the first time in days
thank you for bringing me back
the most senior of the burly men says thats all your miracle days used up kid
you need to rest
you can stand everyone a beer later
aron is greeted by medics
will you look after this for me please
he opens his fist and there is the small folded up knife
he pulls again releasing a huge chunk of air into a metallic bubble
a very soft voice reading
his love the peace that passeth all understanding
my only one
there you are
she strokes his head so gently
how are you feeling
are you okay
youve been asleep for days
we are so lucky
shes a decent woman and a devoted mum
she looks weary worn out with worry and love for her boy
mom im sorry i scared you
very soft voice again aron hears the same words as he drifts back into drugged rest
his love the peace that passeth all understanding
pull and kick
wanting oxygen now
all of this without flash of celebrity
his first press conference
and boy is there a lot of press there
aron of course has his camera with him as he walks out and takes a snap of the noise and light
we see his still its floor to ceiling wall to wall journalists
we can see him beneath swimming along the floor of the pool like a diver building lung capacity
the vast crowd again floodlit ready to begin their evening
in arons x somewhere in the endless parking lot outside the stadium
rana is wearing glasses reading an sms shes just received
ok hes got vegetarian hotdogs and the tickets and hell be outside gate in
so are you guys ok with me
we split up a while back when you were in hospital
christine told me
always to the point is that what this is about
she laughs at him
what about the climbing
aron reaches in his bag and pulls out his scary looking prosthetic arm axe
he clinks the points together
she doesnt laugh maybe a smile
im gonna finish the ers this winter or next
to change it well all i cant figure out is what took you so long to cut it off and get one of these
they both laugh
but he also answers
rana before i did it i was hallucinating i saw this child a little blond boy over her glasses not jesus please
no he looked like my cousin charlie but way too young
and i didnt know why but i knew he was mine and that this was what lay in front of me
he looks at her
she doesnt say anything
but its not going to be you is it
no aron its not
rana leans over and tenderly kisses his cheek
you know everyone who cares for you a little bit of them dies each time you go back
before he can work out how to answer she breaks the door open
lets go hero
if they do the fly first and we miss it well never be forgiven
the concert explode into life
a man will rise a man will fall
his face pushing for the surface
he surges up and out of the water to cling by his elbows on the side of the pool
from the sheer face of love like a fly from a wall there in front of him on the grass by the pool is the same sofa as in the
on it and around it his friends and family including rana
theres so many of them they fill the screen
tucked deep into the sofa is his son giggling away
they smile simple silent support for him
he looks right back at them
