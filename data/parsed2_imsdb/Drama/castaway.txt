b if window
href b b by william broyles march the texas plains horizon to horizon nothing but the browns and ochres of earth and the blue and violet of the sky
the sheer scope of it sinks in the blank slate of nature the absence of man
on the screen superimpose a plume of dust comes into frame
the dust is from a truck orange and white and violet with fedex blazoned across the side
the truck turns into a collection of ramshackle world war ii era quonset huts and outbuildings
around the outbuildings are large sculptures of wood and metal
the door is opened by a woman in her late twenties
hair pulled back casual an artist
she hands the driver a fedex box which is decorated with a drawing of two angel wings
the driver has a hand held computer a portable printer dangles from his belt
the driver scans the package with his hand held computer prints out a label and sticks it on the box ready to go
but something on the box catches her eye
she wants it back
he glances at his watch
she draws rings around the wings uniting them
she gives the box to the driver then hands him a cup of coffee
theyve done this before
he takes a sip of the coffee then runs for the truck
he jumps in and heads back onto the plains
the driver jams the distinctive angel wing box on top of a dolly and loads it into a container with clear plastic sides
a female loader slaps a large bar code label on the container scans it then pulls the container across a belt of rollers onto a larger truck
the doors of the truck close
the latch slams down
a forklift hoists the container to the cargo doors of a
one of a seemingly endless line of fedex planes our taxis to a gate at the fedex superhub
the hub is a vast living organism loud complex overwhelming as much a symbol of modern life as was the factory in modern times
five thousand people work in a frenzy of interconnected activity inside three vast hangers brightly lit
hundreds of forklifts and cargo pullers dart about their headlights crisscrossing like a laser show
loaders quickly roll the container onto a forklift
the forklift speeds inside one of the hangers to a loading belt where our box is spilled into a mississippi river of packages hundreds of thousands of them all shapes
and sizes from shoe boxes to engine blocks
large mechanical arms divert the immense flow of workers at dozens of stations
the packages surge and move
the workers place the packages label side up on new belts where theyre scanned by laser readers
picking up speed our box is shunted across the acres of interlocking belts
the box ends up in a much larger container labeled cdg
a forklift lifts the container to a door on a giant md
a jumbled room jammed with computers and dominated by a huge wall graphic that charts hundreds of airplanes
an operator moves a yellow strip labeled jumbo across the board
the giant place touches down in paris
the angel wing box moves quickly on another belt and disappears into another container which is loaded onto still another airplane
the plane lands
the container is unloaded down a belt
we see our angel box
directly in front of it is a dented box
the manic activity has come to a dead stop
our two boxes sit on a table in a corner not far from a small christmas tree
yuri a supervisor saunters over picks up the angel box sees an attractive co worker puts it down
a cat walks by the table where our two boxes have come to rest
a fedex truck pulls out of the warehouse
the walls of the warehouse are covered with graffiti
the streets are slushy the buildings blanketed in snow
the driver sits in the truck drinking tea
he takes a last sip sighs gets out with the angel box
walks slowly toward an apartment house
a beautiful young russian woman opens the door
a young american man comes up behind her signs the form and takes the angel box
we see christmas decorations inside
the woman puts her arms around him as the door closes
accented english its pretty
who is it from
we stay with the driver as he ambles back toward the truck
the driver has just delivered the dented box to aleksei russian businessman who closes the door of a czarist era building
aleksei checks his watch picks up the phone
chuck noland early thirties walks along a line of brightly colored jitneys each bearing the fedex logo
with him is a filipino fedex supervisor wearing a guayabera
chuck glistens with a thin layer of sweat
my guess is were talking fuel filters here fernando
the gas is dirty these jitneys get in the mountains their engines cut out
that could lose us half an hour
his beeper goes off
chuck is on the phone
so it finally turned up
chuck hesitates for a moment then looks at his watch
ill catch the sweep tonight
strapped into the jump seat behind the pilots chuck sleeps with a mask over his eyes
on his lap are some travel brochures
we see sailboats we see the florida keys
christmas in russia
brightly colored lights
chucks gets out of a volga with aleksei
he has a bag over his shoulder the dented package under one arm
the staff has assembled near the loading dock
yuri the station manager stands in front occasionally catching the eye of the attractive woman
chuck displays the fedex box
it took this test package thirty two hours to get from seattle to st
petersburg a distance of nine thousand miles
and then it took forty one hours to get from our warehouse in st
petersburg to here a distance of what six kilometers
so how are we going to get this place shaped up
theres a muttered chorus of answers
theres only one way
we have to work together
every one of us depends on everyone else
if one package is late we are all late
if one truck misses the deadline we all miss the deadline
lets start by taking a look around
chuck leads his team through the sorting area
yuri squeezes right next to him ostentatiously carrying a clipboard
here this table is too far from the wall
packages can slip down
pulls out a package from behind a table this
he hefts the package as if trying to guess whats inside
what could be in here
lets say one of you sent it
could be the closing papers on your dacha could be a toy for your grandsons birthday could be a kidney to keep your mother alive
i dont think you want your mothers kidney to end up behind a table
the sorter shoves the table against the wall
yuri says something to the translator
he says they have been very busy
it is hard to get good employees
he is sure you understand
wrong answer chuck glances sharply at yuri
aleksei appears with a cellular phone
chuck takes the phone opening his bag as he does so
im getting them
he pulls out a set of blueprints and tacks them to a bulletin board as he talks
im looking at the blueprints of k
the belts are too small for the sorters
yeah sometimes you never see whats right in front of your face
look its chuck keeps an eye on what is going on in the warehouse
then he notices something over by one of the trucks
to a loader hold it
hazardous material needs its own container
back on the phone three in the afternoon there right
that gives you five hours until the sweep comes through
do the sort by hand tonight then put in a new feeder belt say a twenty four incher
yes overtime is authorized
he hangs up the phone
he turns to the crew
im going out on every route im going to work every job here until i know enough to help you
the crew disperses back to work
chuck and aleksei walk toward the office
theyve done this before
chuck lets a corner of his command persona slip
worse than warsaw
nobody remembers that
the failures they remember
its the successes they forget
a fedex truck pulls out of the fedex office
chuck is inside
he notices the graffiti on the walls
chuck rides next to lev the driver a serious sort
the translator squats on some boxes between them trying to keep his balance
you sorted your packages before you left
none of the other drivers did
the translator and lev exchange a few words
he says he wants to be organized
do packages in order
chuck looks at lev with respect
so how come the other drivers havent left yet
the translator asks lev who looks at him as if he is crazy then snorts an answer
the translator blushes
he says he is a very rude fellow tell me exactly what he said
he says why dont his farts smell sweet
lev shrugs and says something else
he says thats just the way it is
lev its lev right
listen this is fedex
we dont have to accept the way it is
a weary chuck enters the hotel
in the sky above him we see the northern lights
he doesnt even look up
chuck is watching cnn on the television working his powerbook and holding the phone
no keep trying
a circuits bound to open up
he hangs up
to himself those damn northern lights
just then the lights go off
for a moment everything is darkness
then a small light switches on
chuck has a headlamp on
he gets up heads into the bathroom
we stay in the bedroom
after only a moment the light reemerges
it heads over to his bag
we go with it
chuck takes out a roll of toilet paper
the guy is prepared for anything
he goes into the bathroom closes the door
the lights come back on just as the phone rings
we hear scuffling sounds on the other side of the door
chuck charges out holding up his pants
grabs the phone
we hear an answering machine
this is kelly leave me a message and ill call you back soon as i can
this is not what chuck wanted to hear
kelly damn look this is chuck
im going to be a little late
well more than a little
i had to go to russia
couldnt be helped
could you call and cancel the trip
look well sail the keys in march
its better then anyway
ill be back before christmas
i mean i will
i uh hes stumbling over whether to say i love you
i miss you
he gently hangs up the phone
a surprised yuri stands with the attractive assistant as chuck takes his clipboard away
an even more surprised lev stands by his truck as chuck hands the clipboard to him
chuck and the loaders clean off the graffiti
working alongside the sorters as the packages come in chuck points out how to organize the inflow
chuck and lev go over large maps of st
petersburg with the drivers
a big semi is being loaded with outgoing packages for the airport run
aleksei chuck lev and the office executives watch as containers are rolled on
weve never got all the trucks in on time
chucks looks at the clock
only one still left
aleksei points at the big semi
if we dont send it now we may miss the connection in paris
the pressure in on
chuck looks around at his team
to aleksei give it five minutes
the last truck rolls in
the last truck enters and loading dock
a few loaders move toward it
the executives all stand and watch
but not chuck
hes hands on
he heads toward the truck and begins pulling off packages
all the other executives follow him
led by chuck who works like a man possessed they sort the packages
bermuda is in the memphis thru container
no azores is europe
he gestures at a closed container
the paris container
japan goes to memphis
chuck is everywhere setting the example
the whole office is energized working together
they load the last container on the waiting truck
chuck pounds the truck on the side
the truck roars out of the loading dock
everyone takes a breath
they are happy proud
we did it
all of them
great job everyone
remember work together
we are like a hand
theyve heard this before
lev holds up his hand just before chuck does
one finger weak
all fingers working together strong
this makes chuck smile
you got it
a fedex md is being loaded with huge containers of freight
chuck goes up the gangway next to the forklifts
the pilots jack and gwen are going down their check lists
chuck sticks his head in the cockpit
i absolutely positively have to get to memphis overnight
cant help you
jack gotta be something wrong with our physicals you keep getting certified to fly
gwen arent you worried
were on time right
on time chuck
chuck hands jack and gwen small packages
little present from the emerging republics
another fedex road warrior named stan gets on
he and chuck are obviously old hands at this
what connects the world
what makes it one
they ignore him we do
you are such a lifer
what do you expect from the guy who stole a kids bicycle when his truck broke down
i borrowed it
the two of them strap in
howd it go
the good guys won one for a change
hes finished a tough job
hes relaxed and on his way home
but stans his boss and stans got bad news
i had to bump your plane last night
chuck cant believe it
it was fifteen minutes late
the plane begins to taxi
i checked the weather you had the jet stream you could have made it up
but i might not have
i got it working
you have no idea how hard it was
theyre finally a team
you fucked us over
the point of fedex as i understand it is to make the damn connection
i was making a point
let paris hold its plane
let memphis take care of it
let somebody down the line clean up your mess
every person counts every package counts thats my point
you know what your problem is
you just see the packages in front of you
you dont see the big picture
i do see the damn big picture
the md takes off
chuck is focused on his powerbook with the screen away from us stan is doing tai chi amidst the fedex containers
it feels a little surreal all those containers surrounding them
stan comes over looks at the image on the computer
its a sailboat with some technical specifications under it
i didnt know we had sailboats
its a ketch kelly and i had chartered
for all those vacation days you got coming
chuck doesnt look up
and never take
look im sorry about your plane
but i couldnt risk being late into memphis
you know general mclelland he wouldnt attack unless he had everything just right
finally abe lincoln came to him and said general if youre not going to use my army could i borrow it for a while
so he gave it to grant and grant just said lets go
im from arkansas
tell me a story with robert e
lee in it and maybe ill pay attention
were warriors not desk jockeys
weve got to be bold
you always want all your ducks lined up
but nothings percent
its always maybe
hell id take
then roll the dice
thats why youre a gambling man
thats why im running foreign and youre not
thats why youre not married and i am
for the third time
take the plunge admit your mistakes move on to tomorrow
thats fedex thats women thats life
stan is so outrageous chuck cant help but laugh
you are one sick fucker
im trying to help you here
theres warsaw theres this this was nothing like warsaw
i held the truck then minutes its not that big a deal
but apparently it is
look that kids bike thats a guy wholl do what it takes to get there on time
live up to your legend thats all im saying
chuck reaches in his pocket pulls out a bill
a hundred rubles st
petersburg hits percent in a month
ninety five percent
just give me the money now
talk is cheap
are we on or not
chuck closes the powerbook
lets go off line
they both take out their valium the price they pay for being such road warriors
stan puts on his walkman
and the stones
got to be
its their ritual
chuck puts headphones from his walkman over his ears puts a mask over his eyes and leans his head back onto the headrest
we hear the rolling stones
the md arrives at its gate
the cargo doors open
forklifts and a gangway roll up to the side
stan stands smiling over chuck
wake up chuck
chuck pulls off the mask takes out the earplugs
he manages a groggy grin
you gotta do your own delivery from here
chuck walks through the extraordinary nexus of speeding packages that intersect in intricate paths above and around him
this is the beating center of the fedex world the crossroads the deep core where everything connects
in his still drugged state it all seems weirdly psychedelic
a christmas tree goes by then a huge plastic santa claus both with shipping labels
chucks car pulls into the driveway of a small cottage in an older memphis neighborhood
the radio is playing the news
chuck drops his briefcase and his bag
the place is a jumble of clothes papers books etc
in the living room is a tank of tropical fish
the water looks a little green
no bubbles are coming from the filter
chuck walks to the tank
he tightens a piece of tape that holds the power cord onto the filter taps the filter with his finger once twice
the bubbles start again
but for a couple of fish floating on top of the tank its too late
chuck gets out his scoop and slowly skims them off
sorry im really sorry
chuck digs a small hole in the back yard with a large kitchen spoon
drops the dead fish in
fills the hole
the cd is playing
chuck lies in bed switches on the tv
this is no good
he doesnt care how late it is hes going to find kelly
chuck drives in his car through the streets of memphis
chuck pulls up to a lab building at memphis state
two doctoral candidates are playing doom on their computers when chuck walks in
you seen kelly frears
one of them gestures toward a door
chuck makes his way in the semi darkness past rack after rack of specimens in bottles
ahead of him we see the flashing green light of a xerox machine
the light goes off
kelly leans over the machine bangs on it
hey be nice to it itll be nice to you
surprised kelly turns to greet chuck
she leaps into his arms
your eyes are puffy
did you take valium again
you smell like formaldehyde
kelly looks over at the xerox
my last chapters in there and the damn machines jammed
lets take a look
he lifts up the cover
how was russia
dont overwhelm me with details you know how i hate that
did you get it fixed
i thought i did
he pries up one feeder then another
got to follow the paper path here
chuck forget the xerox
so russia didnt turn out well
but chuck doesnt want to talk
hes focused on the machine
used to you could fix these yourself
she pulls him out of the machine
he has toner on his fingers
what do you want me to say
that i thought id done a great job but it all turned to shit
that i might as well have gone sailing for all the good i did
yeah tell me
tell me all of it
he suddenly looks really tired
you dont even know what time it is
what day it is
he turns to the xerox in frustration
and i cant fix this damn machine
she looks at him
a tiny cubicle with a door
she closes it takes some paper towels out of the desk wipes his fingers
were on the deck of the ketch the airs soft the waters clear as crystal
she licks the last bit of toner off his fingers
she ignores that stays with the fantasy
were covered with suntan lotion and sweat
our skin is so hot its glowing
and she comes closer to him
we could take a swim
shes really close now
on the other hand we could not take a swim
they squiggle themselves onto the desk
someone kicks the door shut
now the figures are in silhouette lit by the light in the office
and then the light goes out
a nondescript office park near the airport
chucks car screeches into the parking lot
he jumps out glances at this watch and heads for the building at a run
a large room dominated by an animated map of the world
lights at various locations blink and flash
above the map are a large sign saying here today gone tomorrow and two huge digital clocks one keeping time the other a countdown clock for that days package sort
at the superhub
the operations team of fedex sits around a large table
each has on a headset
becca twigg the business like senior vice president of operations addresses questions to a man colin parker bowles the european operations manager on a large tv screen in front of
london is superimposed on the screen
so why was milan late colin
one of the race horses coming from ireland got colic and had to be off loaded in brussels
that put the jumbo six hours late into charles de gaulle
customs had difficulty locating the dutiable items
colin continues as chuck out of breath slips under the screen and heads for the one remaining vacant seat across from stan
next to stan is maynard graham an mba systems man
becca addresses a question over to stan
stan can we get p a down to work with milan customs
were already on it
and lets look at our live animal policy
i dont think the income stream justifies delaying ip product especially at christmas
a red light goes on
becca pushes a button
another face comes on the screen
oakland appears under the face
stand by benson were still wrapping up foreign
she turns pointedly to chuck
chuck thanks for joining us
chuck swallows nervously tries to talk matter of factly
becca as you know st
petersburg was consistently running late by six to ten hours sometimes a full day or more
i replaced the station manager
we identified inefficiencies and worked out a quality improvement plan i believe can be met
you replaced the station manager with a driver
a local with no knowledge of our systems
shouldnt you have brought in someone from memphis
russia is priority one
james pottinger is available
the process is being ripped out of chucks hands
he struggles to get an answer
hes a numbers cruncher
chucks done all the right things here
stan is doing his best to back up chuck
jims a terrific financial man no question
but we cant always parachute in from memphis
weve got to build up our local staff
weve got to improve foreign on time thats what weve got to do
if this new guys so good how come the very first plane he sent missed the connection in paris
maynard knows how to go for the jugular
everyone looks at chuck
were building a new team here
we got every package on the truck for the first time ever
success is the best teacher
i dont call missing the plane a success
everyone looks at chuck
chuck lugs a big package up to the door knocks on it
kelly opens the door
merry christmas eve
not if you work for fedex
chuck enters as they keep talking
her house is cozy but also where she works
theres a computer specimen jars and some terrariums with frogs inside
a christmas tree with packages under it
you break four million packages last night
in the b
one of the packages by the christmas tree is starting to shake on its own
you dont seem too happy about it
ah the staff meeting could have gone better
let me guess russia came up
chucks attention goes to the tree
one of those packages just moved
the package turns over something darts out
its a puppy with a bow around its neck
chuck bends down to see the puppy
hey look at you
i figure if we could take care of a puppy we could you know take care of a baby she wants to say but thats going a little fast so
she catches herself
chuck picks the puppy up
he is a cute thing
hes your cute thing
i cant even keep fish alive
a puppys got a little more personality than a fish
and for you chuck hands over his present
so do good things come in large packages
kelly opens chucks present a very large box
its a piece of luggage
you know for when you travel
for when i travel
she cant believe it
its the exact opposite of what she wanted
you should have got me something that shows you want us to be together not apart
chuck is flummoxed
women read so much into things
i wasnt sending a message
i though youd like it
chucks beeper goes off
you should have got me a ring
he checks the number
i have to go
im on call for overflow down at the hub
i wanted a ring
what to do
look i love the puppy
i love you
but i have to go
you cant go now
i have to
you want to
chuck picks up the puppy
what should we call him
or is it her
how about jango
kelly is having one of those moments when everything comes clear
this isnt working out
were a little emotional here
its christmas maybe were over reacting
were not over reacting
could you watch jango
i cant take him to work
he hands her the puppy
well talk about it when i come back
itll all be fine
this is not a happy woman he is leaving behind
its dark now
the stars are putting on an amazing show but he doesnt notice as he heads for the door
the tree and the presents under it are gone
no answer nothing but the sound of jango who begins yelping in the kitchen
chuck picks up jango who is barricaded in the kitchen with some food some water and some wet newspapers
holding jango chuck walks out into the back yard
a fire still smolders
the packages have burned
the tree is a blackened mess
chuck stares at it
chuck gets into his car puts jango on the front seat next to him
pulls out of the driveway
chuck is in his car with the dog on his lap
chucks car drives up to a typical arkansas farm house
his mom is setting some christmas tree lights around the door
chuck gets out of the car
theres a large wet spot on the front of his pants
what happened to your pants
mom meet jango
chuck displays the puppy
chuck works on an old tractor in the shed
some small legs appear in his vision then a small face
this is amanda his niece
around the table are chucks brother roger his wife mary amanda and her two brothers
mom brings in the turkey places it on the table sits down
they all hold hands and bow their heads
chuck hesitates just a moment
bless us o lord and these thy gifts which we are about to receive from thou bounty through christ the lord
the children burst out the door shrieking chased by jango
the grown ups are cleaning up after christmas dinner
the scene moves between the table the kitchen counter and the refrigerator
its an old fashioned kitchen simply furnished
thought you were going to bring her
so did i
it seemed like she had such a good time last time
its nothing you did mom believe me
jennifers still down at the post office
and shes still got that crush on you
and shes still got those roger
you should have stuck around
this is an old sore subject
look i help take care of the place
you got my check didnt you mom
that new roof thats your doing
youre just allergic to farming thats what dad said
cant stand to be alone
cant stand to be in one place
cant stand the sight of
he drops the turkey giblets into the trash
rogers going to put chickens in here
chuck cant believe this
come on roger this is dad all over again
you already did beefalo chinchillas and what was that ostrich
they chased mom around the yard sprained her hip
mom goes to the freezer and takes out some frozen strawberries
it wasnt that bad dear
you cant make a living out of this place
sixty three pounds consumed per capita up from twenty seven in
going to pass beef
no religious taboos
you dont see your hindus and your muslims boycotting poultry
no sacred chickens nowhere so far as i know
rogers working at tysons now
mom mashes the block of frozen strawberries with a fork to separate the strawberries from the ice
come on down to the plant
its state of the art
were doing for chickens what fedex did for the delivery business
just dont count em before they hatch
roger grins at him
this is just how they are
ill try to remember that
they all sit down
mom brings the slushy frozen strawberries to the table squirts on some reddi whip
looks pointedly at chuck
speaking of hatching i could sure use some more grandchildren
not a timely topic with chuck
mom this is a farm
weve got real strawberries growing outside weve got real cream
oh no the prodigal sons home
we bring out the store bought
chuck takes a bite winces a little as the cold strawberries hit his teeth
chuck fixes the drain pipe while mom prunes the rose bushes around the porch
maybe i should take a few days off
rogers working now you could use some help around here
dont you even think about it
the place is falling apart
im doing fine
she looks pointedly at chuck
doing great mom dont worry about me
theres settled folks and theres nomads
youre just not a settled folk
you never belonged here
chuck finishes the drain pipe
gives it a thunk with his finger
come on inside mom
youve had a long day
in his boyhood room we see chucks laptop which is hooked up to the internet fedex homepage
all around him are models of boats and planes maps pictures of far off places
the room of a boy who always fantasized about getting away
chuck is beside it slumped down on the desk
his mom waves to him as chuck drives away
chuck enters his office on the go
his assistant leslie is waiting for him
i need the latest pdrs on st
and how was your christmas
she nods used to this
and get me in to the dentist
my tooths acting up
were meeting in ten in operations
to leslie get me everything on indonesia new guinea all the way to australia
chuck leslie stan and another executive from the meeting named dick are gathered around the tv screen
a squawk box is on the table
can you hear us
the box squawks
the tv screen rolls an imperfect image
cant we get this working
a technician is fiddling with the tv set
kamal youre breaking up
can you hear us
kamal is not here
who is this
where is kamal
it is ibrim i i am a sorter
whats going on down there
kamal is not here

the squawk box hums and crackles
chuck turns to the technician
we got telex e mail

chuck turns to leslie
whens the next jumbo
the regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow
theres a sweep leaving memphis in an hour goes through sydney
maybe you should get your ducks lined up first
chuck looks over at stan
get me on it
and stan is impressed
chuck leaves with his bag over his shoulder and the puppy under his arm
kelly opens the door
chuck is there with the puppy
thats your dog
its our dog
it belongs to us
there isnt any us
yes there is
kelly cant stay mad
im sorry about the presents
i got a little carried away
no it was great
maybe a little overkill i burned the christmas tree
shes half laughing half wanting to cry
why didnt you come over get mad at me tell me what a stupid bitch i was
i guess i hadnt thought through how i felt
what you were going to come over the next day all calm and say kelly that really made me mad
dont tell me youre mad

look well do our trip as soon as i get back

and then it hits her
theyre holding the sweep
she stares at him for a long moment then at the puppy
give him to me
he hands her the dog
chuck youre breaking my heart
a week max
well be fine
ill feed jango to the frogs
she kisses the puppy
chuck enters the cockpit where two different pilots are going through their checklists
chuck repeats his familiar patter
al gotta be something wrong with our physicals you keep getting certified to fly
john arent you worried
i disconnected his controls
he only thinks hes flying
chuck settles into his seat
youre on your way home al
al has an australian accent
down home down under
were on time right
on time chuck
settled into the jump seat chuck finishes up his notes on his powerbook and begins his flight ritual
he puts in his ear plugs and takes out his valium
he swallows one then thinks and swallows two more
then he turns on his walkman to the rolling stones puts the mask over his eyes and as usual goes to sleep
the plane is shaking badly
hear frantic garbled radio talk
chuck stirs struggles to his feet drowsy and drugged
everything is hazy out of focus as it was in his earlier drugged condition
but this is real haze
and the cabin also twists and tilts
chuck tries to steady himself against the wall
this is nightmarish
is this really happening
the pilots wrestle with the controls
they have their life jackets on
john glances back at chuck his face floating in a cloud of fear
chuck struggles to put on his life jacket
the plane is vibrating violently
he cant get the straps straight
he is knocked against one wall then another then to the floor
chuck tries to blow on the mouth tubes for his life jacket
cant do it
john motions frantically for chuck to pull on the automatic inflators on his jacket
chuck fumbles for them
huge palettes shift and groan one breaks free banging violently against the side of the plane spilling out its boxes
then it swings and knocks chuck on the head
he goes down
a controller mans the global operations desk
his supervisor stands behind him sipping some coffee
the mood is eerily calm
an assistant moves plane locator cards on a giant board
jumbo is overdue in sector k
where are they
another controller tracks a giant computer screen
somewhere east of port moresby
guam is getting a signal but no location
maybe the gps is out
the signal flashes but is strangely still compared to the others which are moving
the giant plane plummets down from the sky
chuck is semi conscious and bleeding from the head
john pulls the inflators on chucks life jacket which fills with a whoosh
sending chucks arms out to the sides
al struggles with the life raft
its all blurred frantic terrifying
the plane hits the ocean with a crash and a wave of water
the controller is speaking mechanically into the microphone
guam i need a fix on jumbo
shrouded with fog and surrounded by debris the tail of the big plane slowly sinks beneath the angry storm driven waves
a life raft is tossed on dark storm driven seas
inside it semi conscious chuck hangs on
we catch glimpses of the yellow lift raft in the dark as the storm continues
the storm has ended
waves lap gently on a beach cut like a scallop out of a rocky shore
on the beach we see scattered fedex boxes
and we see face down half buried in sand a man in a suit and a life jacket
the tide gently rocks him laps at his face
slowly he gets to his knees
vomits seawater big heaves
he rolls over sits down
where am i
chucks first instinct is to check the time
he looks at his watch taps it in frustration
then he looks around and we look with him
the fog has thinned
we can see palm groves and mangrove thickets leading back into a thickly wooded valley climbing up a steep rocky hillside
the rocks on the opposite point end in a barren ridge
clouds hide the top of the hill
as he takes in his surroundings
he licks his lips
but something he sees is even more important
we stay with him as he walks
he comes to a fedex package in the sand picks it up brushes off the sand walks farther
he picks up another package
chuck walks down the beach picking up fedex packages leaving a trail of footprints in the sand
ahead of him we notice a package decorated with angel wings
chuck has made a neat stack of fedex boxes under some palm trees at the rim of the beach
he examines the angel wing drawing with passing curiosity then puts it on the stack
chuck takes off his life jacket sits down in the shade makes himself comfortable and waits
chuck is still waiting
hes a systems man and the system isnt working
all right guys
check the gps get moving
the full moon shines a ghostly light on the beach
trees cast moon shadows on the sand
chuck seems very very alone
we hear from the dark thickets a strange noise
rustling in the leaves
something crashing in the trees or is it a wave
a jolt of adrenaline courses through chucks body
he lurches to his feet
we hear the noises again
chuck edges toward the rocks at the barb of the hook
keeping his eye on the thicket he bends down and picks up a stone
his first weapon
in the rocks he finds a piece of driftwood
he picks it up in his other hand
he backs between two rocks and stands facing the thicket every sense alert
a cloud passes over the moon
the shadow streaks across chucks anxious face
the morning tide is coming in
we follow the tide as it laps amidst the rocks and finds chuck staring out to sea
the empty sea
where the fuck are you
but now he is really thirsty
we walk with chuck up the beach
beneath the palms he sees a couple of coconuts
he picks one of them up and studies it
its heavy almost the size of a volleyball
how to get in it
he throws it down on a rock
the coconut just bounces off
he wedges the coconut between two rocks then throws a rock down on it
it bounces off
he throws down a bigger rock
it smashes on the rocks and chips
chuck picks up the rock
where the rock had chipped the edge is sharp
it cuts him
the blood stains the rock a bright red
chuck sucks on his finger then he gets an idea the same idea primitive man first got when he discovered stone tools
he picks up the rock test the edge
sharp really sharp
he throws another rock down but it doesnt break
he picks up another rock and strikes the first one
then again harder
a large flake shoots off
this edge is even sharper
he has a knife
chuck uses the stone knife to saw at the coconut
chuck clumsily sharpens a stick with the sharp rock
chuck brings the sharpened stick down hard on the coconut but the stick slides off sending the coconut rolling away
chuck positions the stick pointed end up in a hole then slams the coconut down hard on it
the green nut of the coconut splits
the brown inner nut is free
he smashes the nut with a rock but ow
he hits his hand
chuck licks his fingers but he is so thirsty theres no more saliva
he smashes again
the shell breaks to smithereens
coconut milk splashes everywhere
that was smart really smart
rotating a nut along its axis and carefully moving his fingers out of the way he smashes the nut again
the shell splits
the precious liquid splashes out
left inside is a swallow or two which chuck laps up eagerly
the milky white liquid dribbles down his face
chuck squints at the ocean
his sunburn is bad his lips are cracked
a stack of broken coconut shells is beside him
no ones there again
maybe the gps malfunctioned
that korean airliner did
clouds scud in front of the sun
beyond the reef the waves are high and churning
chuck can see them pound onto the reef
okay do the math
maybe they know where you are within say miles
thats a circle with an area of uh pi r squared
so uh times three point one four thats about square miles
three times the size of texas
this sinks in
then chuck gets an idea
they could use a satellite
but even that doesnt give him much hope
say each satellite photo is feet square thats uh
billions and billions of photos
that sinks in
aw someone will come
chuck sleeps by the coconuts
the tide is coming in
chuck stirs gets up staggers over to a palm tree to relieve himself
he stares idly out at the moonlight on the waves
then not so idly
somethings out there something floating on the tide
what the hell
chuck splashes into the gentle surf reaches the dark object
its a body
chuck turns it over
its al one of the pilots his face gray and waterlogged and very dead
chuck drags the body up on the beach and then collapses exhausted
he sits by it staring at it
im so sorry al
chuck has almost finished a grave in the sand back of the palm trees
hes been digging with a piece of driftwood sharpened with his stone knife
he drags the body into the pit
stares down at it
that could be me
got to cover al up
he wants to say more cant
he scoops some sand over the body
got to cover al up
he scoops in some more sand
its eerily like burying the tropical fish in his back yard
with a rock chuck hammers a crude driftwood marker into the sand
as chuck sits on the beach he half sings half talks yellow submarine very quietly to himself
we all live in a yellow submarine yellow submarine
he looks over at the deep woods and down to the rocky point
comes to a decision
he takes a drink of coconut picks up his club and a coconut sticks the stone knife in his pants
hes ready to go
chuck climbs over the rocks and disappears out of sight
hes still half singing to himself
we all live in a yellow submarine
chucks way is blocked by rocks and jungle
he picks up a rock and throws it to scare away all those bad things
it crashes into the ferns and palm trees
he takes a step into the jungle
chuck struggles through a dense thicket beneath a jungle canopy
vines and creepers reach out toward him
there is no path nothing to show him where to go
chuck climbs through a tangle of vines and ferns
he takes a drink from the coconut he is carrying
the last drink
should have saved some
he throws away the husk
he looks up but the only sunlight reaching him is dappled from the canopy above him
chuck emerges onto a ridge that leads to a summit
he climbs across a rocky lava field covered with scrub lichen and low ferns soil dark as coffee beans his way crossed by steep gullies that cut like dark fingers
into the lava
the lava field narrows forcing chuck closer to the sea
he passes a series of caves their mouths dark and mysterious and scary
he gives them a wide berth
the land narrows to a ledge that stretches across a high cliff perched over the ocean
beyond this rock bridge the path smoothes out to a summit
chuck stares at the narrow bridge then down at the waves breaking on the rocks far below
to get any view he will have to cross the bridge
the late afternoon sun is hot
other than that mrs
lincoln how did you enjoy the play
hugging the wall of the cliff taking each step with great caution he sets out across the bridge
step by step chuck negotiates the narrow bridge
he reaches a flume of polished basalt which cuts across the ledge like a slide in a water park except this flume ends high above the waves
chuck tries to step across it cant quite tries one foot first then the other
he looks back but that seems even scarier
got to get there
got to see
dont be such a wuss
he looks down at the ocean beneath him closes his eyes and jumps
its only a few feet but hes breathing hard when he lands on the other side
he hugs the rocks getting his breath
chuck looks to each point on the compass
he is on an island small inhospitable without sign of habitation or anything human
on three sides the waves break against steep hostile cliffs
a reef encloses the cove where he came from
no way on
no way off
chuck stares out to sea in every direction
this is bad
really really bad
the last rays of sun hit his face
the ocean turns a deep reddish gold
going down is even scarier
its dusk and the light is flat and gray
chuck stares at the ledge
crawl if you have to
chuck crawls on his hands and knees across the rock bridge
chuck stumbles over the rocks
the caves look ominous and primal
its getting dark now
the jungle seems impenetrable the dark wood of fable
chuck hesitates then plunges into it
the moon has just begun to rise casting eerie light into the jungle
the shadows reach out to grab chuck then real branches and vines tug at him
he heads into thick blackness
chuck emerges around the rocks
he reaches the stack of familiar fedex boxes ahh home
hes breathing hard from both fear and exertion
got to drink
got to drink something
with his last strength he opens a coconut on the stick
he bangs hard on the shell and gulps down the milk
he stares at the stack of fedex boxes
what could be inside
he reaches out and touches one
they dont belong to you
responsibility gets the better of necessity and he takes his hand away
face red from the sun chuck hacks at a palm frond with his stone knife
he saws the palm frond off near the base leaving it about a foot long
got to have shade
got to have a hat
he ties the loose fibers into a sort of circle then sets it upon his head
it looks amazingly like some sort of primitive cap
he grabs a couple of fedex boxes and heads for the beach
chuck finishes the p on h e l p which he has spelled out with the fedex boxes on the beach
chuck scrambles down a ravine
he kneels down and feels the ground
it is dry completely dry
chuck traverses the slope determined to find water
with a puddle of dirty water trapped in a tiny hollow
suddenly chuck flops down into frame
he tries to scoop up some water in his hands but he just splashes it around
he licks his fingers
then he gets down on his stomach and laps up the water with his tongue
like an animal
in the bottom of the small depression is some fine mud
he rubs it on his reddened face and across his burned lips
chuck lies in darkness his eyes reflecting the moon
chuck is drenched in sweat
he is at the bottom of a hole six feet deep
he takes one last dig with the flat stick then licks the moist clay that sticks to it
chuck breaks open another coconut and gulps down the milky liquid
with a stone knife he digs in the shell for some of the meat but its dry and chewy and fibrous
he spits it out then lies back on the sand and stares at the first stars
half sings to himself
you deserve a break today
he is desperately thirsty
hunger gnaws at him
holding a sharpened stick chuck wades in the shallows at low tide looking for fish
its difficult to keep his balance
suddenly a shadow flashes by glinting in the morning sunlight
chuck hurls the spear which ricochets off the water and floats away
chuck plunges into the water after the fish with his bare hands
the fish reverses direction
chuck leaps after it and goes under
he comes up spluttering on his hands and knees in the shallows
suddenly a whole school of fish swims by him moving in unison like one creature splitting around chuck like mercury
he grabs at them desperately
on some rocks he sees clusters of limpets
he takes a rock and tries to dislodge one but it smashes into a soggy mess
discouraged he sits down on the beach and gets his breath
idly chuck takes out his wallet
the money is soaked
he lays it out to dry
he finds a photograph of kelly soaked and mushy
he tries to smooth it out
for a moment he is overcome
his face tightens his eyes get moist
he stares out to sea
wait a minute
wait just a minute
he picks up his wallet again and takes out a credit card
chuck wades in the water stops by a rock covered with limpets
he uses a credit card to scrape off a limpet
dont leave home without it
with his finger he prods around in the mucous like meat then tilts up the shell and we see the gooey gray stuff slide off the shell into his mouth
he starts to spit it out
tries to make himself like it
and he swallow it
chuck sits in the shade of a palm tree surrounded by a pile of smashed coconut husks and a stack of limpet shells
he checks his watch for a moment
got to get this fixed
but whats the point
everything that was so valuable before is useless now
chuck digs yet another hole
he chants to himself almost delusionally
water water everywhere water water everywhere
covered in sweat desperate and exhausted he throws down his wooden spade
wheres the water on this fucking island
he lies on his back breathing hard
pulls his hat over his eyes
just rest a minute
chuck is lying in the hole
we find his feet
slowly water is oozing out of the clay a puddle is building around his toes
chucks eyes snap awake
he looks down at his feet
theres a pool of muddy water there
he dips his hand in it touches a finger to his lips to be sure hes not dreaming
he grabs his sharpened stone begins to attack the clay
oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
chuck carefully makes marks on a palm tree with his rock knife
one for each day
lets see i waited two days
makes marks then i buried al
slowly makes another mark al
you never made it home buddy
then american express got me those clam things
makes another mark i dug all those damn holes the clouds over the moon
makes more marks and today the historic discovery of h two oh
makes a tenth mark and underlines it ten days
for a moment he feels the weight of his isolation
then he allows himself a deep breath
there is order now after all
time is under control
very carefully but standing this time chuck makes his way across the ledge
he emerges on the top takes a drink from a hand made canteen and looks in all directions
again he sees nothing but ocean
he resumes his efforts at fishing
a shape scuttles raggedly beneath him
a crab its a crab
he freezes holding his spear motionless
then he jabs at the crab misses
the crab scurries away toward the rocks
chuck splashes after it stabbing as he goes falling getting up stabbing again
suddenly one stab feels different
chuck carefully lifts up the spear
on the end is a squirming crab
i did it
i did it
he walks carefully with it to the beach
lowering the spear he lets the crab slip off
it darts toward the water
chuck heads it off trying to avoid the snapping claws
he kicks it back toward the beach then slams a rock down on it
he twists off a crab claw expecting to see flaky white meat
but a crab has an exoskeleton
the flesh simply pours out like mucous
this is too much
he needs the next step from the raw to the cooked
the crucial next step from primitive man to the beginnings of civilization
chuck rubs two sticks together
chuck positions a makeshift drill in a hole he has scooped out in a piece of driftwood
he spins the drill with great effort
stupid fucking thing
he quits exhausted
he looks at his hands
they are raw and blistered
he feels like job
i dont know what i did god but whatever is was i am really really sorry
you hear me
chuck emerges from the jungle and walks to the edge of the ocean
he dips his blistered hands into the sea water then looks over at the fedex boxes that spell out h e l p
dont have a choice do i
he walks over and picks a few boxes up from the p
with his stone knife and spear to help him
chuck begins to open the fedex boxes
chuck rips open the end of one box and shakes it
out tumble some videotapes
chuck looks at them what good are they
chuck tears another box open
out slide some legal papers covered with post its
in quick cuts we see him dump out computer memory boards some designer dresses flowers a pair of roller blades a script with a red cover which he never reads
by now he has taken all the boxes in the p
only h e l remains
he pauses to let the irony of that sink in then collects more boxes
he is even more exhausted
two boxes remain
one is the box with angel wings
chuck sets it aside
he opens the other box
out tumbles a doctors bag
chuck cant believe it
he opens the bag
its full of great stuff
hands bandaged chuck tries to strike a spark on the roller blade wheel housing
tries over and over
he takes a long drink from his canteen and flinches
his tooth is starting to hurt
he fishes some tylenol out of the surgeons bag and takes two
chuck picks some berries and gingerly tries them
theyre not bad
he eats more
what a relief
chuck lies on his palm fronds groaning and holding his stomach
he drags himself to his knees crawls a few feet and throws up in great violent heaves
still looking a little green chuck marks another day on his tree calendar
he stares out to sea
chuck lies on his belly and drinks from the well which has filled with water
then he washes his face and splashes water over his neck
the surface of the well stills bringing chucks reflection into focus
he stares at himself
very carefully chuck shaves with the surgeons scalpel
chuck checks out his new appearance in the water
a clean start now
he sits in front of his failed efforts to make fire
youre not getting it hot enough
got to hold the heat
got to hold the heat
chuck carefully shaves some tinder
puts it under a piece of bamboo split lengthwise with a notch cut across it
chuck uses a bamboo stick to try to make friction in the split half of the bamboo
he saws back and forth with all his might pressing it down in the groove
chuck gives one last saw with his bamboo and stops utterly defeated
its all too much
he starts to rub again
he breathes hard sweat pours off his face
he is really going for it what the hell
a tiny wisp of smoke appears
chuck saws with even more energy
the smoke increases
chuck rips away the bamboo grabs the nest of shavings and blows on it frantically
the smoke flickers and dies
chuck cant believe it
chuck lies in his bed of palm fronds shivering
he looks up at the stars which blaze furiously
thats the big dipper
or is that the southern cross
kelly would know
and he misses her so much
a shower of meteors streaks across the sky as if the very heavens are raining down on chuck
chuck readies his two sticks of bamboo again and begins sawing with tremendous energy
he smells something
is it smoke
he pulls off the log and looks eagerly at the nest of tinder
theres nothing there
he replaces the log and starts wearily to saw again
the sun has moved in the sky
chuck is still sawing
again the smoke appears
again sweat pours from his face
the smoke increases
he saws even harder
his breath comes in anguished gulps
smoke is curling up now
chuck tears away the bamboo picks up the nest of kindling and blows on it gently
the smoke increases
he blows some more
a fragile crimson spark appears
careful now careful
he gently places the nest of shavings in the kindling then blows on it with utmost care as if he were holding life itself
he shreds his money and business cards over the tiny flame
suddenly the evening breeze lifts the nest out of the kindling
desperate chuck grabs it
trying to shield it with his body he grabs some palm fronds and jams them into the sand trying to make a windbreak
they rustle and shake and blow over
the wind blows harder
chuck jams some rocks in a circle to make an eddy
but the fire is out
no words now just a loud primal groan of pure despair
and then into his vision floats
chuck looks down
a wisp of smoke curls up from the nest of tinder
chuck blows on it gently
suddenly a tiny tongue of flame flickers and catches on the kindling
he feeds in some more twigs more tinder
the flames lick out catch grow
if i ever forgot to thank you god and i am sure i did thank you now
the fire burns on the beach
chuck rushes about piling on driftwood
chuck darts into the jungle and returns dragging a huge log
he throws it on the fire
we see his face in the light of the fire
he is exultant
he sings at the top of his lungs
papa ooo mow mow
chuck throws another huge log on the fire
papa papa papa oooo
the log splutters and explodes sending up a huge shower of sparks that climb and sparkle in the darkness
until they merge with the stars
chuck makes a mark on the tree
around it he carves a flame the day he mastered fire
chuck sharpens his spear with his stone knife
then he sticks it in the flame to harden it pulls it out checks it scrapes some more
chuck wades in the water with his spear
suddenly he stabs it down
a crab is on the end
chuck removes a crab from out of the fire and breaks a steaming crab claw
chuck takes a bite of the flaky white meat
it tastes great
he takes another bite and flinches
he fumbles for his tylenol and takes two pills
chuck stands on the summit looking in all directions
then something on the island brings chucks eyes back from their distant focus on the horizon
from down on the beach beneath the palm grove there curls a thin column of smoke
chuck lets a bit of pride creep into his face as he sees it
he kneels down and begins to build a signal fire
chuck curls up in his bed of palm fronds
the fire burns
around it is a large stack of crab shells
he stares into the fire
chuck makes another mark on the tree
he has circled the tree with marks several times now
using a safety pin and some suturing thread chuck fishes carefully
suddenly he jerks his hand back
on the end is a flopping fish
chuck takes a cooked fish off the fire and mixes it with some breadfruit
he eats the soft mixture chewing carefully but his tooth hurts even worse
there are only a few tylenol tablets left
he carefully cuts one in half and swallows it
chuck arrives with the wood for the night
he stares out to sea as usual but this time he sees something different
he sees whales
water pouring off fins and flukes
chuck stares at them stares until the ocean darkens and he can see them no more
its late now
leaving he takes one last look as he always does
and another remarkable sight greets his eyes
there on the horizon just below the evening star is a
he stares at it fixed
its a star
but then he stares at it really hard
its a ship
a tree shakes and moves quivers
then slowly falls with a crash
i heard that
chuck holds his surgeons saw over the stump
he walks to another tree and begins to saw his way into the trunk
up above the high tide line chuck lashes a log to a row of five logs already joined with vines
no more waiting
chuck sews several designer dresses together with needle and suturing thread for a sail
he cuts bamboo for the mast
he carves driftwood for an oar
he fills gourds with water stores breadfruit and coconut as he sings fly me to the moon to himself
he ties the sail to the mast and extends it with a bamboo boom lashed on with palm fiber and video tape
he ties on the doctors kit and the fedex box with the angel wings
he examines his handiwork a finished raft
he brings out his old life preserver and puts it on then grabs hold of one corner of the raft to pull it down to the beach
it doesnt budge
he tries to pull it again
he leans his back into it and pushes with his legs
he collapses on the beach his breath coming in heaves
how could i be so stupid
he bangs himself on the head over and over
stupid stupid stupid
chuck throws new firewood on the dwindling fire
it comes back to life
meteors streak again across the sky
he stares at the indifferent stars
the moon is almost full
shadows of palm trees sway on the sand
chuck stands by the edge of the water which shimmers in the reflected light of the fire
a wave come in licks at his toes
lifts up a coconut husk sweeps it gently out
chuck watches gets an idea
he begins to dig in the sand by the raft
he grabs the oar and digs faster making a trench up to where the raft is
the rising tide floods water into the trench
chuck rocks the raft back and forth
as the wave recedes it takes the raft with it
chuck has to run beside it
over and over we see chuck capsize at the reef
the first time he has a bandage on his leg
he tries everything different rafts different approaches but each time the ocean spits him back
defeated and utterly exhausted chuck swims back from his latest failure
he wades back ashore with the fedex box and throws it on the ground by the palm tree
he has tried so hard to escape so incredibly hard done everything humanly possible and beyond
he rips off his life preserver throws it into the underbrush then collapses on the beach
youre too low in the water
too damn low
chucks shoulders begin to shake as he is racked with deep sobs of despair
and then he throws his head back and lets forth from deep inside himself a scream of rage and anger and pain
the scream pierces the indifferent natural sounds of the island the rustling of the breeze the lulling rhythm of the waves
it is powerful disturbing primal
the breeze picks up
behind chuck the palm trees begin to sway
the tide is reaching up toward the beach
the waves crash louder
the palm trees sway even more
chuck picks up some wet sand and rubs it on his body
dust thou art thats for damned sure and unto dust shalt thou return
a few drops of rain begin to fall splashing on chuck and sizzling in the fire
chuck looks up clouds have obscured the sun
the wind blows harder
the rain falls harder streaking the sand chuck had rubbed on his body
steam sizzles out of the fire
chuck looks up disbelieving
the bottom falls out of the heavens monsoon rain more rain than you have ever seen before
a long wave rolls up its frothy fingers reaching for the fire
forget the raft
the fire could go out
this is disaster
he springs into action
chuck grabs an empty fedex box
with his wooden shovel he frantically scoops some coals out of the fire as the rain hisses and pounds at them
he slides the coals into the fedex box grabs some sticks of driftwood and sets off on a run
chuck runs through the woods slipping and stumbling
vines grab at him
the rain is so thick he can hardly see
chuck bursts out of the woods into the lava field
smoke pours out of the fedex box
the coals are about to burn through
chuck stumbles up the slippery rocks dragging the smoking box
his face is drenched desperate
chuck tumbles into the cave just as the coals burn through the fedex box
using the remains of the box he desperately tries to scoot the coals into a dry spot
one by one the precious coals go out
dripping water off his hands and face he pushes a few together with his fingers ignoring the burns
he stomps on the driftwood and saws at it with his knife
he places this kindling on the coals
they sputter and sizzle
he fans them with the box
a tiny flicker catches then starts to grow
i need firewood
on the beach chuck desperately gathers more firewood in the driving monsoon
he can barely see
driven by the storm the waves are licking at the palm grove
he runs through the woods
branches whip at his face
roots tear at his feet tripping him
he stumbles up the lava field
barely able to breathe the rain is so strong
he dumps the firewood on the floor of the cave
but where the fire had flickered there is only a pile of wet black ashes
chuck lies on the floor of the cave shivering in the darkness as the rain falls
his fire is out his tooth is killing him he cant escape
chuck emerges from the cave
the rain has stopped
this is the absolute lowest
his face reflects his pain and despair
everything he tried to build is gone
chuck slowly walks out on the ledge
he stares down at the waves breaking on the jagged rocks far below
he lets go one hand
then lets go the other
he is barely balanced
it looks like a wisp of breeze would blow him right off
he slides one foot to the very lip of the precipice
suddenly his foot slips
instinctively he turns into the cliff grabs for a hold
one hand reaches for a nubbing of rock slips off
the other closes his fingers straining to hold him
he breathes in deep gasps
he had wanted to end it come so close
what the fuck are you doing
his deepest instinct was to survive
and that is what he is going to do
just hang on
slowly he pulls himself back from the edge
chuck walks aimlessly down the beach feeling the burden of starting over
the beach is littered with seaweed and flotsam bits of rope plastic bottles
he picks up a plastic bottle
that will come in handy
the chuck sees a soccer ball with wilson stamped on it in big black letters
he picks it up holds it tosses it up in the air
then he kicks it then kicks it again then runs down the beach trying to kick it and keep it out of the water
feeling joy again even here
the sun is setting on his darkened cave
the soccer ball sits in the corner by the black cold ashes of what was once his fire
chuck carves a bit of coconut meat takes a bite and winces as the meat hits his sore tooth
he tosses the shell on a small new pile of shells
chuck shakes out the last half tylenol tablet
he puts the tablet in his mouth then takes a sip out of his coconut canteen
when the water hits his tooth that hurts too
chuck mixes a mash of breadfruit and coconut
he tries to pack the tooth with the mash but its so sensitive that even this hurts
he pounds the floor of the cave in frustration
chuck holds a stone chisel and his hammer stone
he positions the chisel against his inflamed tooth
but the thought of what he is about to do is too frightening
he lowers the chisel
chuck tries to fill his mouth with sea water
the pain is so great his eyes water
he falls back in the water and floats there looking up at the sky
determined chuck hold the stone chisel again
he raises it slowly to his mouth and picks up the hammer stone
no pain no gain
he brings the hammer down hard on the chisel
the screen goes black as chucks scream continues under
the sky takes on the first colors of the day
the ocean is still dark but a few waves catch the first light
the sunrise touches the summit moves down the cliff then lights the cove
on the screen superimpose a spear shimmers in the calm morning water
attached to the spear is a man standing completely still
we move up out of the reflection to the real man
his legs are scarred
the remnants of a dress wrap around his middle
a stone knife on a neatly mounted haft is stuck in a belt made of videotape and woven fiber
necklaces of sharks teeth and shells hang from his neck
his hair is long
a coconut frond hat is on his head
the hand wrapped around the spear is scarred and brown as a berry
it holds the spear perfectly still
the watch is gone
we come around slowly until we see chucks face
the eyes say it all
they stare out with a survivors intensity staring at the water unblinking
this is the man who used to splash futilely about in the water trying to fish
this is the fedex man who was plugged into the tumult of activity and energy surrounded by technology and human activity at its most intense devoted to making seconds count
now he is utterly alone and utterly still
and now he has all the time in the world
suddenly without an once of wasted motion he shoots the spear forward at a low angle
it quivers stuck on the bottom
he pulls it out with a practiced twist
on the end is a struggling fish
but this isnt a thrill anymore
its another day at the office
chuck makes a mark on a palm tree
he has completely covered three other trees with marks
it sinks in how long he has been here
chuck carries the fish back from the beach
now there is a well worn trail
chuck enters with the fish
we are greeted with the well ordered lair of a primitive stone age man
clam shell spirals weave in and out around the fire hole
strips of eel jerky and fish hang drying from racks
tools are lined up neatly digging sticks stone hammers and saws spears neatly hafted onto shafts drills awls
bits and pieces of feathers skins bones rags leaves are all neatly arranged
strings and cords hang from hooks
coconut bowls and cooking rocks form a small kitchen
a raincoat and rain hat woven of palm fronds is neatly draped over a frame
evocative pieces of driftwood decorate the room
a wind chime of obsidian flakes sways gently
the watch hangs on a stick
the angel box has the place of honor on one side
on the other side the wilson soccer ball rests on a throne of rocks
seaweed has been placed on the ball as hair
clam shells have been stuck on for eyes other shells form a mouth
a tube shell and conch form a pipe
the fish are being smoke under a palm frond
eel skins hang from sticks roasting
chuck sits by the fire hafting a stone knife onto a wooden haft
he ties some fiber to a stick then braids it into string using both hands and his mouth for the three strands
he ties the string tightly around the shaft
he does his work automatically
chuck eats some fish and some mashed breadfruit
he chews each bite his eyes in distant focus
the firelight flickers on his face
chuck carries firewood up to the summit
he mechanically adds wood to the fire
as he does so something out to sea catches his eye
he stops and stands up
whales broach out past the rocky point
spouts of water shoot into the air
as he watches them a light comes back into his eyes
theres a big gap where his teeth had been
he turns and strides down the hill
he heads across the rock bridge that once had so terrified him without losing stride
its second nature now
chuck enters the cave picks up the ball and heads out
the signal fire burns
a spectacular cloudy sunset lights up the sky
chuck sits with wilson on the summit a bowl of mashed breadfruit in one hand a bowl of roasted eel skin in another
as chuck watches the sunset unfold watches the whales going by in the darkened water he takes some roasted eel chips dips them into the breadfruit paste and offers one
his voice is flat monotonal
but wilson declines
he takes a big crunchy bite
another fucking day in paradise
pull back as the sun goes down and chuck reaches into the bowl again and dips an eel skin chip in the dip
torch in one hand wilson in the other chuck walks across the rocky ledge
he passes the flume without even noticing
suddenly his shoe breaks
its sandal made of woven yucca leaves
he bends down and fixes it then heads on down the ledge
chuck makes a casual leap a leap he has made hundreds of times but this time the sandal comes loose
it catches on a rock and chuck falls
his hands are cut and bruised
he tries to get up cant
chuck sits back and examines his foot
his fingers come back covered with blood
he reaches out to steady himself and leaves a handprint of blood on the rock
chuck wraps his foot in bandages
chucks face is sweaty
he looks down at his foot
it is red swollen infected
he stands up tries to put some weight on it
the pain is intense
chuck sticks the scalpel onto some coals to sterilize it
he holds it over his foot takes a breath then jabs in into the wound
the pain is intense
chuck passes out
chuck stirs takes a drink weakly tosses on another log and collapses back on the floor
chuck wakes up trembling shaking wet with sweat
he staggers up
his shadow sways on the wall of the cave
he struggles to get another log on the fire
he squints at his only companion the soccer ball
help me wilson
he collapses again
chuck stirs and squints his eyes
he takes a drink of water
he is feeling better
he puts another log on the fire and slowly begins to chew on some breadfruit and dried fish
chuck slowly wades into the water favoring his injured foot
but something feels different
he glances around
what is it
and then he sees something perhaps the worst possible sight
a sail is moving steadily away from the island
throws down the spear and waves his arms
he runs into the water and starts to swim
he is so weak however he can only make a few strokes
he tries to yell as he swims
choking and weak he turns back and drags himself up on the beach
in the b
the sail dwindles into the distance
chuck struggles to the top of the hill
his fire has been extinguished by the rain
in the distance far against the horizon he sees a sail or is it a cloud
the whiteness shimmers against the horizon
whatever it was it is gone
above him some contrails from jets mark the sky
furious he kicks his signal fire scattering the burnt out coals
chuck makes a new mark on his calendar tree
then he stops
he cuts an angry big line under the last mark then hacks away at the palm tree slashing it with the stone knife ripping and marking through all his dates
finally the stone knife breaks in two
chuck drops the broken half and catches his breath
chuck enters the cave
no signal fires burn
the island is dark
chuck stands on the summit staring out to sea
nothing not even a contrail not even a whale spout
he is on his way down suddenly he sees something and stops
its the handprint the bloody handprint his own handprint
he slowly extends his hand and covers it then pulls it away
traces it with his fingers
chuck has the beginnings of an artists studio
several large clam shells hold paint
a few egg shells are lined up
brushes have been made from roots and feathers
chuck covers his hand with paint and makes a handprint on the wall of the cave
he stands back and looks at it
he chews some berries then holds his hand against the wall of the cave and spits a dark blue mist around it
when he takes his hand away the silhouette of his handprint remains
with the angel wing box as a model chuck dips one of his feather brushes in paint and make a tentative line on the wall of the cave
he works hesitantly rubs off a line tries again
chuck is finishing his first figure a crude portrait of a man himself
hard to tell
he examines his work
he takes some shells and sticks them on as eyes
chuck picks up wilson thinks
you old airhead you need a makeover
he takes some charcoal out of his fire and draws eyebrows on the ball
then he mashes some berries dips his fingers in the juice and makes lips
he sticks shells on with clay for eyes
then he looks at the face
wilson you bad
he sits back and regards his companion
he gestures around the cave at the new paintings
what do you think
but wilson doesnt have an opinion
you dont share much do you
idly chuck takes down the angel box
i guess i know how kelly felt
for a long time he studies the wings on it
with a stick he tries to draw a similar wing on the dusty floor of the cave
dissatisfied he wipes it away
he looks at the angel box
casually he reaches over and cuts it open with a stone knife
inside he finds two bottles of green salsa
and a letter
he reads over it
you said our life was a prison
i cant begin to tell you how much that hurt
i dont want to lose you
im enclosing some salsa the verde you like
use it on your sticky rice and think of home
then come home to me
well find the spice in our lives again
i love you
visibly moved chuck puts down the letter
he never got it
the monsoon pours down
wind whips the palm trees
the waves are gray and angry tearing at the beach
as the rain pours down outside chuck studies the sodden ruined photograph of kelly which is really only a gray mess
shes probably found someone else
i would have
chuck dips his finger into one of the bowls of colors and streaks it slowly across his face
to exorcise his loneliness he will paint on the most expressive canvas there is his own body
close up on scarred fingers as they paint on chucks face and body
color on skin
tight dramatic shots of chuck being transformed
chuck takes white paint and covers his hand
then he presses it into his chest and makes a handprint
he draws a yellow spiral on his leg then takes red and makes jagged lightning bolts on his chest on either side of the hand
shimmers in a gourd
chucks face swims into focus
it has been painted white
looking at himself in the reflection he dots on blue stars with dark blue from squid ink
the rains have stopped
the island is washed bright and green
as he stands up in the cove
his face is white with blue stars
handprints circle his torso flanked by red lightning bolts
braided cords circle his biceps
bone necklaces hang from his neck
feathers jut out from his hair
chuck goes from tree to tree making handprints along his path
chuck was here
this is his mark
he covers the calendar trees with handprints
eyes fixed on the beach he walks toward the shoreline
chuck emerges from the palm trees and now we see what he had seen
and another one
chuck stares at the barrels
chuck sits staring at the oil drums
its almost as if he is hesitating to take advantage of them
that he may not want really to leave now
then his inner struggle ends
what the hell are you waiting for
filled with determination chuck rolls a barrel up the beach
using a palm tree as a fulcrum chuck hauls hard on a rope made of vines pulling the barrel up off the beach
chuck throws aside palm leaves revealing
the remains of his raft
chuck is drawing with a purpose now
and we see what he is working on
the plans for a raft
chuck is making a list of what he needs
he works intently
got to weave rope
chuck lashes the barrels onto the raft
checks the knots
lashes more rope
he sews dresses together with handmade fiber string
he weaves videotape together to form a sea anchor
chuck digs a channel toward the raft
chuck constructs a water collection device with some fedex boxes some plastic weighted with a stone
explains it to wilson
now im hoping that if this is airtight ill get condensation down here a cup or so a day
if im careful it should be enough
chuck writes on the wall
if i never return know that here lived chuck noland for four years
i drew these paintings
i made these marks
and then i took my fate in my own hands and set forth to save myself god willing
chuck loads the raft which rocks gently in the cove
he has a sail made of designer dresses sewn together with fiber thread
a sea anchor secured by videotape woven together into a rope
plastic bottles filled with water
a signal kite made of fedex paper
then comes the fedex box with the angel wings
wilson my main man
time to go
and he gently leads the raft into the lagoon
wonder what odds stan would give me on this
he jumps onto the raft begins to paddle out toward where the surf crashes onto the reef
waves break against the reef
with his paddles chuck maneuvers the raft toward the cut in the reef
the wave crashes the water surges through the cut then recedes with a whoosh
chuck watches times the waves paddles like mad
scrape goes the first barrel then the second riding the receding wave
but the next wave is already surging forward
it smashes the raft against the reef
coconuts and foodstuffs hurtle off the raft
the barrels cushion the impact
the raft tilts spins but stays outside the reef
the ropes holding the jugs of water break
the water sweeps overboard
the wave recedes again
chuck recovers paddles with all his strength and then hes clear of the breakers
for a long moment he floats on the rollers getting his breath
the water jugs float away carried by the waves back into the lagoon
chuck could go back and get them
if he were being prudent he definitely would
but hes out
he might never get back out again
he stares at the lagoon and the receding water jugs
then he stares at the island
goodbye to all that
wilson were out of here
he turns and begins raising the sail
powered by its multicolored makeshift sail trailing its gently flapping signal kite of fedex paper the raft slowly moves away from the island out toward the open ocean
and we pull back until the ocean swallows the tiny raft and then we tilt down and
the ocean again low
the raft floats into frame
a trace of a breeze flaps the signal kite which barely stays aloft its rope frayed and tattered
the still is set up in the middle plastic with a rock weighting down the center
chuck is gaunt his clothes rotted
he lies looking over the side of the raft spear in one hand staring intently at the water
dorados swim like specters flashing and darting
chuck stabs with his spear
slow down damn you
exhausted he sinks back to the raft
two dorados leap into the air ahead of him
chuck tries to stare again into the water
he spots another fish a flash of silver under the surface
chuck struggles to his feet raises his spear
something strikes him in the chest almost knocking him into the water
on the raft we see flashes of silver and green and blue
a flying fish
chuck dives at it catches it loses it
catch it catch it catch it he catches it again just as it almost flops over the side
chuck sucks the juice out of the head
he chews meat off the tiny rib bones
chuck is in the stage of malnutrition vitamin deprivation salt insufficiency and exposure where the personality splits and becomes external
like all castaways he has conversations with the two sides of himself
save some for tomorrow
catch another fish tomorrow
chuck keeps eating
he stares up at the sun which beats down unmercifully
the raft drifts
chuck has taken down the sail and rigged it as a canopy
drenched with sweat chuck lies on the raft trying to sleep
he dabs at some sores that are ulcerating his body and wont let him get comfortable
plus theres a chaffing squeaking sound
he looks around for the source
we see it with him
one of the ropes is frayed and about to break
if it does the logs will come apart from the floats
stay calm identify the problem
problem rope fraying
solution fix rope
theres nothing to fix it with
this rope comes undone youre going to drown
just get up and fix it
feels so good to lie here
get up damn you
chuck comes to his knees
then sinks back down
youve had todays water
come on shape up get going you can do it
no water no work
chuck tries another tack
okay look i know youre tired i know youre thirsty but give it one more shot youve just got to do a little more
do too much ill die
do too little youll die
going to die anyway
that stops goodchuck for a moment
okay look have an extra swallow
he holds up the pathetic little jar with its few teaspoons of murky water
no more water you said
take it damn it
wilson do you believe this
take the damn water
slowly chuck gets up lifts up the water jar and takes a swallow
chuck works to braid a new rope
he is focused concentrating as hard as he can but everything is slow and hard and hes weak and clumsy
he tests the rope but it doesnt hold
got to use something else
he gets an idea starts to pull the signal kite in
if they cant see you whats the point
survive today thats the point
the kite rope is much thinner than the rope he had used to tie the logs but its all he has
he ties the log with the kite rope
exhausted he lies back down
the moon is full
the waves cast off shadows on the ocean
chuck is staring into the sky trying to find a star to navigate by
polaris where are you
maybe im too far south
you dont know where you are
you missed the shipping lanes
moons too bright
we hear the fraying sound again
chuck saws at the outer log with his stone knife
across the water comes a storm
we can see it like a waterfall moving toward us
youre putting off the inevitable
im putting it off
he looks at the deteriorating rope at the rotting sail
thats whats happening to you
chuck pushes the outer log away then takes the loose rope and begins to lash it around the center logs
youre rotting away
the raft is rocking
the waves are stronger
its hard to tie the logs together
rain falls like a sheet on chuck
fix raft first
water water water chuck works frantically in the rain trying to tie the rope
finally he does
then he scrambles for his water collecting funnel struggles to pull it up
one corner is stuck and collapses
desperately he rights it pulls the funnel up
drops begin to run down the sides and collect in the jar
soaked chuck stares at the water as it rises
then the rain stops
we see the line of rain recede away from chuck spattering the ocean
but all around him the ocean is calm again
and out comes the sun
the raft floats on quiet seas
the sky is blue with few high cirrus clouds so motionless they seem pasted on
chuck lies on the raft sick and weak
suddenly from the depths beside him silently rises a huge shape
a sperm whale still mainly submerged
the blow hole is near chuck wet and pulsing like giant lips
the eye of the whale is only a few feet away
it looks upon chuck out of an intelligence deep and alien
he slowly comes to his knees and stares at it
the blow hole opens and whoosh out shoots a geyser of fine spray which settles on chuck in a mist
the whale rises farther dwarfing the raft
from the whale comes a deep sound like a foghorn
startled chuck jumps back rocking the raft
he catches himself slowly reaches out and touches the whale
the whale blows again drenching chuck in more spray
chuck touches the whale again
you like that
very slowly it drifts along with the raft
lost your mate
we look right into the whales eye
beneath the surface we can see the huge jaws open and close
you idiot if he dives hell capsize the raft
very slowly the whale moves ahead of the raft its vast body passing chuck
no dont go
look ive got fish
chuck rips a fillet off the line and throws it in front of the whale which ignores it
please dont dive
the whale slowly sinks then suddenly arches its huge back and heads straight for the bottom
for a moment all that remains are the flukes black and vertical against the dark blue sky
with one swoop those flukes could destroy chuck and his raft
but they dont do anything except slowly sink
then it is gone
we are on chucks face as he stares at where the whale had been the surface marked only by a ring of concentric ripples that reach out and gently rock
chuck checks the water
it is green and full of floaties
it looks awful
he takes the jug puts it to his mouth and drinks
instantly he throws up back into the jug barely keeps from dropping it
look what youve done
he dips his hand into the ocean splashes some sea water on his face splutters it out then licks his lips
he is so thirsty
he looks at the water jug full now with his own vomit turns away begins to work on the sea anchor again
but the work makes him even thirstier
he looks at the jug again
picks it up
takes a long drink
the fish return
chuck gets up with his spear then puts it down
what are you doing
cant kill another one
cant kill my friends anymore
you fucking bleeding heart you kill or you die
why do they have to die for me
theyd eat you if they could
theyre laughing at you
doesnt hear anything
got to eat
chuck picks up the spear stabs it misses
suddenly he has a fish on the end of the spear
it struggles he scoops it onto the raft brutally pounds on its head twists the stone knife into its spine
the struggling stops
chuck looks at the dead fish and begins to sob
i am so sorry
he cries uncontrollably
as he cries he cuts off the head pulls out the eyeballs and eats each one
then he sucks the marrow out of the head
then takes the heart and eats that
then eats the liver
as he is chewing he cuts the meat into strips
when he is done he takes the backbone breaks it and sucks on it
fish scales shine in his hair blood covers his chest
the raft rocks gently
chuck looks up
the strips of fish are glowing
so is the deck where he killed the fish
he reaches out to touch the fish strips
his hand is glowing too
im an angel
suddenly he sees other lights
a ship is out there
and he hears it a humming in deep register
he waves his hands
his voice cracks we can barely hear it over the ocean
the lights move on
his raft is rocked by the wake rocked hard
chuck is thrown into the water
he comes to the surface sputtering
where is the raft
he looks one way then another
this is the worst
he turns again in the water
there dimly he can see the glow from the fish he killed
the glow saves his life
he swims toward it
he pulls himself back on the raft
he lies there exhausted the glow from the phosphorescence casting a greenish light on his face
clouds are building up
in the distance lightning flashes
the clouds come closer
little bits of electricity jump off the mast
saint elmos fire jumps around chucks hand
fascinated he holds out his hand
the fire jumps from his hand to the mast
suddenly lightning shoots from the sky and strikes the ocean
a huge spout of water explodes like a depth charge
the crack is intense then rolls away
chuck stares then realizes the danger and throws himself down on the raft
suddenly a wall of rain sweeps over him and the ocean begins to roll
the thunder is deafening
lightning flashes bursts through the rain
let out the sea anchor
frantic chuck lets out the sea anchor as the raft scuds down a huge wave
the anchor catches slowing the raft so that it rides the wave down
the waves come at him high as houses
the raft rides up one side then plunges down the next
all chuck can do is hold on
the storm has passed
the raft floats on big dark rollers
we hear the chirping and squeaking of dolphins
they come close to the raft
chuck watches them play
then realizes they are chasing his fish
they drive them along into the path of another dolphin who darts in and rips into the dorado turning the water around the raft into churning bloody foam
he takes his oar and begins beating the water
the killing continues
you fucking murderers
suddenly the water is still
one dolphin sticks its head out of the water and stares at chuck squeaking
another dolphin lifts its head up then another
they squeak to each other clearly communicating and talking about chuck
i know youre talking about me
he splashes the water with his oar
they dive then jump into the air squeaking as they go
very softly take me with you
why me god
he begins to laugh
listen to this wilson
deep voice god because you piss me off
chuck tries to stretch with some simple yoga
each movement takes forever
he rolls over onto his stomach and tries to do a pushup
collapses onto the raft
youre falling apart
tries to do another pushup
first you eat your fat then you eat your muscle
he rolls over
then you eat your mind
he looks at the ocean
theyre in a line of garbage a thick slick of debris dumped off of ships
roll on you deep and dark blue ocean roll
he closes his eyes
after a minute they come open
im late im late for a very important date
they slowly close again
his eyes come open again
look just slip off the raft
the ocean would feel so good the waters so soft and warm
take a little swim
you quitter you quitter you quitter
the sea is lovely dark and deep
but i have promises to keep
rolls over and miles to go before i sleep
props himself up and miles to go before i sleep
purpose now got to fix the sea anchor
use the sail
use the sail for a sea anchor and you wont move
if i dont have a sea anchor ill capsize
die tomorrow or die today
he hums beethovens fifth
ba ba ba bum
thats death knocking knocking on your door
crazy little woman come knocking knocking at my front door
grow up stop being such a baby
other people get through a lot worse
yeah sure what
he hums to himself begins to sing beatles
im so tired my mind is on the blink
he pulls in the loose sea anchor rope which is covered with barnacles
he scrapes the barnacle off the rope into the water jug then sips it
the sun is setting huge rays shoot out across the sky
out of the empty ocean the dorados suddenly appear leaping flashes of silver right by the raft
one dorado swims right by the raft broadside
chuck looks at it uncomprehending
then slowly reaches for his spear
are you sacrificing yourself for me
carefully he comes to his feet then shoots the spear into the fish
flapping and struggling it lands on the deck
chuck pounces on it
he cuts it open
the other dorados ram the raft in fury like a lynch mob
i had to do it
the banging continues
he concentrates on his work then sits back on his heels in amazement
theres another fish inside
he holds that fish up stares at it then cuts it open
theres a smaller fish inside it
i know theres a moral here god but right now im just going to eat
he pops out an eyeball then another and crunches them between his teeth
he takes the heart and liver starts to eat then stops
forgot to say grace
he struggles to remember
bless us o lord and these thy gifts and christ and the bounty about to receive or something
he eats them
chuck splashes sea water on his face
adjusts the water still
please dont leak
chuck picks up the smallest fish
its half digested
he washes it in the ocean trigger fish come up and nibble at his fingers
dont look at me
it was that dorado
he cuts the small fish and hangs it on the stays
you know wilson every now and then we should say thank you
thank you god
thank you for fucking up my life
suddenly something bumps the raft
fins cut the water
a big hammerhead bumps the raft
badchuck hums the theme from jaws
chuck takes his spear stabs at the shark
hes going to get you going to get you
another one circles in bumps the raft
get away from me
the shark circles again that big hammerhead like a nightmare
get him get him get him
he stabs at it with his spear
he might as well have stabbed concrete
the shark circle chuck stabs again
but the shark is gone
where are you
where are you
stabs again and again at the empty ocean
youre using energy
chuck kneels wavering on the raft
the ocean is calm
the raft tilts
chuck hangs on
then a shark appears just out of spear range
its lifeless black eyes seem to stare right through chuck
if the dorado was a gift from god this is a message from hell
then the shark is gone
chuck lies back on the raft
he is humming
what are you smiling about
theyll be back
im dancing on the roof of the peabody hotel
he smiles at the thought
the music ends
we go back to the table
the waiters have brought dinner
new york strip with bordelaise sauce
mushrooms in brown gravy
roasted potatoes with garlic and rosemary
green beans with almonds
fresh biscuits and cornbread dripping with butter
a nice salad with ranch dressing
a jumbo shrimp cocktail
thinks about that it spoils the picture
then we eat
he closes his eyes
this is the greatest fantasy
as the waiter for dessert we have pecan pie a la mode we have a double chocolate cake with creme anglaise we have a nice pear torte fresh key lime
pie or perhaps if you care to wait a few minutes a grand marnier souffle
chuck thinks over the options thinking of each one
why bring them all bring them all
he rolls over
there square in his vision is a ship its form coming in and out of a low haze
chuck jumps to his feet
the ship moves on
we can see the decks the rigging the vastness of it
chuck realizes he is naked
struggles to pull on the remains of his pants finally holds them like a diaper with one hand as he continues to wave
on the ship no one is to be seen
it is a spooky sight
the big tanker moves on
we are on chucks face
passed up again
then he realizes what is about to happen
he throws out the sea anchor
he throws himself onto the raft and grips it as tight as he can wiggles his feet into the ropes
then comes the wake of the ship
it rocks the raft like a piece of flotsam
the raft rides high up on the wave then shoots down it but the sea anchor holds and the raft slows and rides along with the wave
and then the sea is calm again
slowly chuck sinks to his knees
his hand lets loose his pants
he lies down on the raft and imagines the conversation with the ships captain
permission to come aboard sir
may i ask where are you bound
as it happens im headed for frisco myself
would you do us the honor of joining us
were just sitting down at mess
pork chops and gravy cranberries baked potatoes with all the trimmings fresh baked bread apple pie
no please join me
some sundried fish strips a few eyeballs some gills to munch on
the depression comes back again
theyre never going to see you
youre just another piece of trash in the ocean
theyre on autopilot
theyre always on autopilot
or else its night or youre in the sun or youre in the trough of a wave
theyll never see you
dont be so negative
chuck picks up wilson
wilson whats your story
he holds wilson close to his chest
end of story
im always going on about me me me
enough about me
its a fucking soccer ball you idiot
he lies on the raft and holds wilson close
we move up until we see chuck lying curled up on the raft wilson cradled in his arms and all around the vast empty ocean
chuck slowly wakes up
sets wilson aside
dont shirk dont procrastinate dont be lazy
were okay today
were okay today
and the other chuck begins to laugh
the laughter goes on
shut the fuck up
i mean it
he stands up and checks the horizon
whats so damn funny
suddenly chuck sees something on the horizon
a bank of clouds
a cone of land
he squints stares again
the clouds part
it looks like his island
chuck doesnt know whether to feel joy or despair
look again asshole
its a mirage
nothing out there but ocean
lets get a second opinion
what do you see
chuck picks up the soccer ball holds it up and stares out at
chuck slowly writes on the sail
died pick a date july
and now the epitaph
lost without a trace
he sits back looks at the mock headstone
what did it matter if fedex was five minutes late one day
the next day we just start over again
we do the best we can thats all we have
then weve just got shit
he goes on writing
i am writing this to remind myself to live a better life
if i am lost perhaps you who find this will be instructed to live a better live yourself
live each day
love your children
dont take anyone for granted
is that it
life is a fucking disney movie
the waves begin to grow the ocean turns a slate gray
far above him great frigate birds circle
suddenly one dives on a booby which has caught a fish
the great frigate bird swoops all around the booby until panicked it drops the fish which plummets toward the sea
with a graceful dive the huge bird grabs the fish and then soars up on a thermal high into the sky
lightning flashes back and forth across the horizon which is turning black and dark
the raft goes up and down huge waves
every few seconds lightning flashes illuminating the raft and chuck holding desperately to it his eyes wild with fear
the waves continue
chuck holds on his face pale
you cant make it
i dont feel like dying today
the sky clears
the waves are still big
the fish are back
and then come the sharks cutting through the water
chuck cant get up to get his spear he just has to watch as blood darkens the water
and then the sharks are gone
chuck comes to his knees slowly then a big wave hits
wilson is swept into the ocean
for a moment chuck is uncomprehending
he watches as wilson slowly floats away
please no sharks
then he dives in to the water
swims frantically after wilson
wilson floats away from him
he swims but hes so weak
finally he gets to wilson
he reaches out but only pushes the ball farther away
it bobs on the waves
chuck treads water exhausted
where is the raft
then he turns back the other way
the raft has drifted by him
he can go after wilson or he can go after the raft
he swims toward the raft barely moving
no matter how hard he swims the raft seems to recede from him
finally he reaches it hangs on the side breathing hard choking crying
he struggles to pull himself on board
but he is weak so weak
he cant do it
summoning some primitive reserve of strength he tries again
this time he slides on
he lies on the raft panting
then with all his strength he pulls himself to his feet holds on to the mast scans the ocean for wilson
nothing but waves
this is too much
chuck starts to cry
chuck takes a swallow of water washes it around in his mouth then swallows
with his wet tongue he licks his cracked lips
the sun breaks through the clouds
with what strength he has left chuck raises the canopy fastens it
he sits in the meager shade his head between his knees
closes his eyes
just for a minute
a different sort of shadow crosses chucks face
he opens his eyes
there riding right beside his raft is a ship a huge rusty tanker
someone shouts down in a language we dont understand
chuck sits up cant believe it
struggles to cover himself
chuck is lifted up the rusted steel side of the boat in a jacobs ladder
chuck steps on board cant support himself
the crew gathers around
none of them speak english but there is a spontaneous outburst of human connection
one man brings some water
another a blanket
another some warm tea
chuck sits there shivering now
oh thank you
a cavernous hanger sized ward brightly lit and filled with row upon row of hospital beds each with its table side chair and lamp each with a stainless steel bedpan
and neatly folded sheets and blankets stacked ready to use and each completely empty
except for one
and on that bed we see chuck in a blue hospital gown
an iv drips into his arm
he plays idly with the remote control of the bed
he raises the head then the foot
he pushes another button and the knee rest bends the bed again
a doctor enters carrying a thick chart
chuck gives him a big manic grin
malcolm macdowell in a clockwork orange
my favorite doctor
whats the verdict
under the circumstances your overall health is good
those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated but theyre healing nicely
he checks his blood work records
youre anemic thats why were giving you iron
potassiums low were giving you an electrolyte solution with your iv
sodiums over way too high
you may experience swelling in your extremities as you rehydrate and discharge the salt
in spite of your dietary deficiencies theres no sign of mental deterioration
chuck has been trying not to laugh
now he cant stop himself
whats so funny
chuck cant seem to help laughing at everything
why do my joints still ache
any or all of the above
all i ate was fish
thats solid protein
protein digestion is very costly in water usage
which i didnt have
and fish are very low in fat which is energy inefficient
so youre going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat
luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas which contain some vitamin c so you didnt get scurvy
chuck laughs again
i am one lucky guy
your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability depression anxiety periods of self reproach
its almost like schizophrenia
different sides of your personality might come to life speak out act out
but all thats behind me
im fine now
he starts to laugh again
if you say you are
i most definitely say i am
doctor hegel tells me he discussed the vietnam pow syndrome with you
chuck stifles his laughter
yes yes he did
you are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life
not to mention on me
the laughter again
you sure you dont want some counseling
chuck gives his biggest smile
doc im not on the island
im not on the raft
im so glad to be back i cant tell you
i just want out of here
well when that iv runs out youre through with us
just the dentist tomorrow
rolling his iv chuck walks very slowly out of the ward
every step is an effort
a small windowless room with only a desk and a phone lit by a fluorescent lamp
chuck is listening to the phone ring
chuck is overcome for a moment cant say a word
for some reason he cant keep himself from laughing
he covers the mouthpiece and laughs
and then we hear a dial tone harsh mechanical final
we can see chuck inside staring at the phone
we hear a faint persistent hum
chuck looks around trying to locate the sound
he looks up focuses on the fluorescent light that background sound he can no longer tune out then picks up the phone again
stan answers the phone
stan its chuck
the laughter again
whoever you are you are one sick fucker
and again we hear the dial tone
chucks on the phone again
two valium and the rolling stones
that ring a bell
theres a long silence
then we hear stans voice
chuck its you
youre fucking dead
im most definitely not dead
and as i recall youre the sick fucker
chuck begins to laugh a little too loud a little too shrill
hes on a high
a terrace by the ocean
tables filled with diners
food being delivered by waiters
so simple eating
so taken for granted
at one table sits chuck dressed in a hawaiian shirt and shorts with a half dozen plates in front of him
he gestures to the waiter
bring me more
it all tastes so damned good
behind him is the ocean
chuck doesnt glance at it
an attractive dental technician with an australian accent cleans chucks teeth with an ultrasound device
shes close very close
chuck looks up at her
she looks really good
she smiles at him then touches the gap where he knocked out his tooth
you sure you dont want to have the implant done here
we do quite good work
chuck shakes his head no
she scrapes behind his front teeth
hmmm you do have such a lot of tarter behind these front incisors
a little wider please
chuck opens his mouth even further
the technician talks on in the self absorbed way dental technicians sometimes do that constant babble of human contact which chuck has not heard for four years
anyway so the second prosthetic foot worked better but he still couldnt drive his new cortina it being a standard shift if you follow me
i follow you
but would he hear of me driving him around
not on your bloody life
stan bursts into the room
chuck struggles out of the chair
they are both almost overcome
stan holds chuck by the shoulders and looks at him
youre alive youre fucking alive
chuck laughs thrilled to see stan
i beat the odds
you beat em to shit pal
i still need to floss you
stan notices the technician
this is amber
her boyfriend lost his foot in a shark attack
he says this with an absolute straight face holding back the laughter with great effort
instantly theres this connection again between him and stan
and he and chuck make eye contact and we see a glimpse of their shared unspoken irony
uh theres somebody out here who wants to see you
chuck stares sharply at him
stan nods but theres something he wants to say
she thought you were dead
we all did
thats not all stan wants to say
but chuck is limping out the door
typical dentist waiting room
chairs tropical fish tanks magazines a few waiting patients
and kelly looking nervous
slowly and painfully chuck enters
hes quite a sight
she stands up
theres a long moment where they look at each other
then she comes into his arms
holds him tight
shes part laughing part crying
chuck is happy hes still riding the high
youre so thin
am i hurting you
well maybe a little but who cares
he hasnt been hugged or barely touched in so long
she disengages looks at him with that old smile
right back you said youd be right back
a few things came up
or went down
he meets her gaze looks her over with a smile
i like your hair
he notices the ring on her hand
i got married
i thought you might have
i would never i know
if id known you were alive i would have done the same thing
his responses come so quick
chuck seems blissfully sure of himself
i didnt want to
it just happened
one day gary was there
he took care of everything
he took care of me
i was a mess
you have any children
got a picture
kelly fishes for a photo shows it to chuck
its a little girl with a dog
her names hannah
is that jango
no this is jack
jango was hit by a ups truck
can you believe it
it is funny sort of
lifes just one big joke after another
stan appears takes in the scene
the few patients waiting are edged into the corners trying to look occupied with something else
how about we go somewhere else
want to see my raft
chucks raft sits up on a dock
kelly stands staring at it
how small and fragile it looks
this stinks really bad
you should have smelled me
stan examines the ropes around the logs
i braided them
must have taken a hell of a long time
time i had lots of
kelly points at something on the raft
thats my sea anchor
my second one
made it out of part of the sail
it keeps you from capsizing in a storm
picks up his still and this this i used to collect water
about half a cup a day
hes not feeling sorry for himself
its just a fact
you were how long on this
forty three days
they look at the tiny raft
it speaks for itself
all that time i waited to go on a cruise and you went without me
couldnt be helped
kelly notices the sail sees the writing on it
whats that written on the sail
kelly reads it to herself
her eyes are moist
bad body chemistry
made me a little morbid
but im all over that now
and he seems really to believe it
ill be at the car
to kelly take you to the airport
and he leaves
i buried you chuck
they had to pry my fingers off your coffin
this interests chuck to no end
there was a coffin
yeah coffin headstone the whole thing
what was inside
your calendar your cell phone your whoo pig sooey hat some pictures of that ketch you wanted
that about sums it up
maybe nows when you tell me about it
the plane went down
my friends died
i washed up on an island
then i found these barrels built the raft and here i am
the tide came in the tide went out
thats the headline
dont overwhelm me with the details
she smiles remembering you know how i hate that
he tries to put it into words isnt quite sure how
gently come on
dont take anyone for granted
dont sweat the small stuff
live each day like its your last
so simple to say so hard to do
not when you have no choice
kelly looks down at the raft
its so small
you hated being alone
couldnt stand it
busy every minute
always plugged into something
i didnt know what really being alone was
no one back here does
he has something more to say
were not meant to be alone
not like that
share life thats what came to me out there
be with someone
and thats the point isnt it
we are social animals
no man is an island
this is so unfair
thats what i told the fish i caught
but i ate them anyway
and the laughter comes again
kelly grins embarrassed a little worried
she stares at his face reaches out touches it again this time with great tenderness
he nods her touch feels so good
a wave of emotion comes over her pity
what will you do
i dont know
i really dont know
we hear a distant beep beep discrete as a car horn can be
ive got to get back to memphis
hannahs babysitter has finals
it means a lot
that you came
i had to come
to be sure you were okay
they hold each other
for a long time
i love you chuck
im so glad youre alive
then she heads for the waiting car
chuck stands by his raft watching her go
chuck and stan ride on the plane
chuck is coming down off his survival high
he has the angel wing fedex package with him
when i first showed up i thought youd lost your fucking marbles
i never thought it would end
then it did
it was so great to be saved i couldnt stop laughing
stan pulls a flask out of his bag
you need a drink
stan takes two glasses from his bag rests them on a fedex container and pours the whiskey
for years my only drinking buddy was a soccer ball
stan hoists his glass
nows when stan gets to the question hes been wanting to ask that kelly wanted to know that we all want to know
so whats it all about
chuck stares at him
youve been over the line and you came back
youve been saved hallelujah
stan looks over at him
the burning bush the big picture the words in neon
whats it all about
its about being so thirsty youd crush a fishs backbone to suck out the spinal fluid thats what its about
stan sits back repulsed but relieved
do what it takes
thats what i always told you
he pours another drink
fuck em if they cant take a joke
thats all there is
believe me i know
he takes a sip of his drink just savoring it thinking
but its not being bold or being in the game or rolling the dice
all those things stan used to tell him
when i was going crazy on the raft id argue with myself about everything
because everything had a price
to get anything a sip of water a little corner of shade an hours sleep i had to let go of something else
and then i could never get it back
he thinks some more
you dont win or lose
you win and lose
he looks out the window
you win and lose
and chuck has
a fedex md lands
the md taxis up
as usual the superhub is a frenzy of activity
a loading crew stands ready forklifts poised
even this plane carries packages
phil steele the chairman of fedex leslie becca dick and other executives wait on a special podium near the gangway
everyone looks different older a mustache here a thickening around the belly there
behind a barrier a cluster of cameras film the scene
the plane cuts its engine
the stairs are rolled out
forklifts and gangways move forward
cargo doors open
chuck appears in the door
he holds the fedex package and a small travel bag
chuck blinks against the lights and the glare
stan is right by him
everyone bursts into applause and cheering
after four years of total solitude this is completely overwhelming
and chuck waves
hes overwhelmed by all the input
stan steers chuck down the steps as the cheers continue
at the bottom of the steps roger steps forward
the two brothers embrace each other
after a moment roger disengages
mary gives chuck a hug
oh chuck wheres mom
waiting for you
at the farm
this was too much he looks around at the crowds
tell me about it
stan nudges chuck
time to go to the podium
glad you made it big brother
stan and chuck head for the podium
all the loaders and operators and package scanners begin to applaud
chuck smiles then laughs getting into the emotion
he keeps up an almost indecipherable babble underneath the cheering
occasionally he sees someone he knows
hey rasheed how you doing
thank you all
chuck makes his triumphant way through this amazing collection of cheering people like moses parting the red sea
with a big smile phil steele holds out his hand to chuck
he steps to the microphone and addresses the superhub
this is an extraordinary moment
and it should be marked in an extraordinary way
with something we have never done since this company was founded
pause stop the line
all over the superhub belts come to a halt
tracking stations shut down
the vast flow of packages is suddenly still
the incredible din of activity is suddenly quiet
the stillness and the silence are unexpected and palpable
thousands of workers stop as well staring either up at chuck directly or at his image on video screens
we hear phils voice piped in
phil holds a plaque
four years ago we placed this plaque in honor of charles noland and two just like it in honor of al morris and john durham the two brave pilots who
went down with him
as he talks we stay on chuck who is taking in this amazing scene not really listening
chuck endured years of hardship and loneliness
like lazarus chuck has come back from the dead
chuck this is your family all of us
so it gives me great pleasure
to take this plaque
and to present it to our long lost son
he hands the plaque to chuck
chuck acknowledges the cheers of the crowd
thank you very much
give me a minute
ive spent four years looking out at an empty ocean
he laughs a short brittle laugh composes himself
its all so big
you never think youll miss all this
but i did
i really really did
and i missed all of you
he looks over at the hub
youve added some new belts and whats that
he points at some high tech equipment on the edge of the shed
digital laser readers
digital laser readers
he looks around at everyone doesnt know what else to say
ive never heard it this quiet
shouldnt you all be getting back to work
the tension is broken
phil steele motions with his hand
let it be done
the vast incredible machinery creaks to a start
everyone shakes chucks hand as he leaves the podium
as he heads for the car reporters shout questions
we are assaulted by a surge of light motion activity
snaking lines of traffic in both directions big overpasses the city rising beyond
stan drives with a certain aggressiveness
chuck looks out at the traffic at all the activity at the vast intricate anthill of humanity going everywhere and nowhere
take your time
thats what its about
dont rush things
i get it
he swerves into another lane
not just that
take your time
deep real deep
he grins cuts across to the exit
so where to
chuck stares at him
are you kidding
deliver this package
then i dunno
re the package you want that delivered well deliver it
thats what we do
i need to do it
finish what you started
you havent changed chuck
its still you
you want to help help me find the woman who sent this
stan and chuck are in the office of a technician who is working away at his computer
the technician pulls the bar code from the angel wing fedex box up on his computer screen
after three years the ptr reverts to tape storage which is okay because we access it through the cpc
here it is
gestures at computer map ten packages from the same sender
the guy was a real road warrior
this package was kuala lampur
no activity in his account after this package
no forwarding addresses after k
what about the sender
lets run a current check
he works some keys waits
durango colorado asheville north carolina then
canceled her account
can you find her
youre looking at a level iii search
for your level iii you gotta have e authorization
i dont have it
he holds out a badge
okay lets let it rip
he starts to pull up the data
chuck leaves the motel the angel box under his arm
he ties it into a pannier on the side of a bicycle
chuck sneaks up to a craftsman cottage and stands by a tree with a swing on it
inside we see kelly making dinner for her husband who plays with their daughter
for a moment chuck watches through the window and we watch with him
then the dog begins to bark
chuck walks through the cemetery late at night
he comes to his gravestone stares for a long moment at the inscription then takes out a spray can of paint and puts a handprint on it
he gets back on his bicycle and rides away
chuck rides his bicycle down a road leading into the south
chuck negotiates an overpass crossing an interstate highway
headed in both directions cars whoosh by beneath him
chuck rides down a narrow road shrouded in mist
moss drips from the trees reaching over the road
a car goes by
then another their lights like halos in the fog
its a mystical scene a passage
chuck gets off his bicycle in the rain and walks toward a roadside cafe
chuck draws on a paper place mat as he waits for his meal at a counter
above the counter the television plays
and heres more from dingo dodd our australian correspondent on the extraordinary story of chuck noland the modern robinson crusoe
the waitress sets a plate down in front of chuck turns to watch
on the tv we see an australian correspondent standing on chucks beach
shark infested waters
a deserted island
surrounded by reefs
accessible only by helicopter
for four years chuck noland survived here alone eating fish coconuts and clams his only companion a soccer ball
chuck is staring at the screen seeing his cave seeing all those years
im now in chucks cave where he passed the lonely nights painting on the walls like some prehistoric caveman
what did chuck feel
these paintings tell the story but only chuck knows what they mean
and hes not talking
on the screen we see a photograph of chuck
the waitress looks over at chuck
the other clients look at him too
the waitress comes over
no charge honey
but could you just sign that place mat for me
chuck looks down at his doodling
then signs his name
thousands of chicken carcasses hanging on hooks circle through the huge processing plant a vast structure on the scale of the superhub or the hospital
chucks mom dressed in white with a hairnet enters a windowed office in the b
through the window we see her hug chuck
we are in the office now
chucks moms eyes are moist
whend you start working here
roger got me on
i wasnt doing anything and but youre back youre really back
i would have come to memphis but i wanted to come here
chuck eats a southern fried drumstick
the table is full of home cooked food
have some more potato salad
chuck gestures no im full
she puts down the spoon
that was great mom just great
he looks around the house everything in its place
his mother has been here for forty years
theres a big crack running down from the ceiling
ive got all this back pay coming
why dont you let me get you a place in town
this is my home
im part of the wallpaper
she studies him for a moment
you miss it dont you
you miss that island
he does but thats not it entirely
miss that island
mom come on
she looks at him
she knows her boy
what a journey youve had
it seems more than a person should have to bear
the tide saved me mom
i lived by it
im just wondering where it will take me next
she looks at him thinks about this
remember the family motto
it will come to you in time
chuck rides away from the small neat frame house down a country lane with trailers up on blocks
chuck leaves a cheap motel as the sun comes up
chuck rides on a ferry the wind blowing his face
the sky is gray and drizzly
he smells the salt water
watches the waves
chuck asks for directions
a kid in baggy pants and no shirt points him down the road
chuck pulls some clothes out of his saddle bags
chuck emerges from the restroom wearing a fedex shirt and shorts
a classic beach house
sand dunes stilts
carrying the angel wing box under his arm chuck checks the address in his hand
mounts the steps
a light mist falls
you can see the gulf behind the house gray and moody
a woman bettina answers the door the woman from the beginning
she wears cut off jeans and a blue work shirt covered with paint
theres a tattoo on her ankle
fedex for bettina peterson
the woman stares in disbelief at the package she hasnt seen in years and never expected to see again
where did you get that
chuck displays a fedex badge
fedex special projects
bettina notices chucks bicycle
you came on a bicycle
no wonder its so late
there was an unavoidable delay
bettina stares at the package her own memories coming back
well i have to say im impressed
you never gave up
she holds the box and studies him for a long moment
something the look on his face the extraordinary reappearance of this long lost package makes her curious
you know what happened to this
as much as anybody
want to come in
get dry for a minute
she lets chuck in the door
huge paintings are everywhere
paintings of wings and angels like the package
chuck stares at them
bettina watches chuck stare
ive got some coffee on
would you like some
bettina pours some coffee
the package sits in the counter
some magazines are spread around including a people magazine with chucks photograph on the cover
takes a sip its good
they smile awkwardly at each other
she starts to open it
feels like it might have gotten wet
so you did those wings
a long time ago
theyre harder to do than they look
well i do a little drawing shes opened the package
she pulls out the bottles of salsa and the letter
our apologies that it never made it to the recipient
he was a sorry sonofabitch and im sorry i ever married him
there is a moment where neither knows what to say
you look familiar
her eyes start to register recognition
she glances at the magazine with chucks picture on it
she picks it up
i cant believe this
i i they are
youre a gifted artist
youre into something very powerful
well not really i you are
yes you are
so many things she wants to say what gave you the idea to paint on that cave
chuck thinks about that
after a moment he grins
to tell you the truth you did
have any more packages to deliver
that was the last one
just sit here ill get us some lunch
chuck sits back on the couch taking in the sight of the ocean in the light rain
he looks over at all the canvases the easel the palettes
the wind rustles the palm trees around the house
the surf crashes and rustles
he relaxes a little
maybe the package with the wings was a sign he kept it all these years precisely for this
then theres a sound of a truck in the driveway
the engine cuts off
there are steps on the porch
the door opens
a tanned muscular man in neatly kept work clothes comes in hangs a tool belt on a hook by the door
he looks at chuck with a relaxed even stare as if seeing a man in a fedex uniform sitting on his couch is not an unusual occurrence
the man nods at chuck goes into the kitchen
we are on chucks face
we hear muffled laughter from inside
arms around each other the man and the woman say goodbye to chuck
in the front yard is a panel truck painted with two angel wings
the man grins at chuck an easy friendly grin
come back anytime
coffees always on
dont even have to bring us a package
that was my last one
bettina hands chuck a sheet of paper
the list of paints and brushes i did for you
he takes it not exactly sure he wants it
chuck rides his bicycle away along the shore
chuck rides along the beach
up ahead we see a fedex truck
chuck gets off his bike as a female fedex driver puts chocks under the wheels which have stuck in the sand
need some help
you bet i do
high tide comes right up to this road
chuck pushes on the truck as the driver gives it gas
the truck slowly pulls back onto the pavement
the driver gets out of the truck with a grin
she has an open friendly face
theres an instant connection between them
id never have got that out by myself
looks at his uniform
at the bike
youre not out of pascagoula are you
where is he from anyway
i used to drive one of those
a long time ago
hey once a driver always a driver
you want a lift
ive just got one more pickup
he picks up his bike
the fedex truck makes its way down the beach chuck in his uniform the driver in hers
two fedex people in a truck
the driver looks over at chuck
youre chuck noland
i knew it
youre a legend
well i knew i recognized you
my names erica
they smile at each other
then she smiles a little more
did you really steal a crippled kids bicycle to make your deliveries or is that just some bullshit story
i didnt steal it and he wasnt crippled
otherwise its completely true
and that makes chuck laugh really laugh for the first time
she looks over at him with a grin
what brings you out to the sticks
had a package to deliver
i had it on the island with me
must be a story there
theres a connection building here effortlessly
we are wide on the beach watching the truck move along the water kicking up wisps of sand
yeah a long one
ive got lots of time
so do i
the truck goes down the beach and then turns inland away from the ocean
away from all that
so do i
and we pull back taking in the sweep of the beach the estuaries and the green forest stretching back into america
the end is the beginning
