href b b the birds by evan hunter nd revision by evan hunter based on the novel birds by daphne du maurier final draft nd revision march it is mid
afternoon and there is a tempo and pace to the people walking the doorman hooting for taxicabs the policemen directing traffic
waiting at street corner for light to change
at the end of line of pedestrians
he is looking up at the sky
as she follows his gaze upward
with hundreds of gulls in it wheeling
as the light changes and people begin to cross
in the crowd walking the other way a man turns to look up at the wheeling gulls in the sky overhead
the camera locates in the crowd of pedestrians approaching davidsons pet shop
she is a young woman in her mid twenties sleekly groomed exquisitely dressed though hatless
she walks with the quick sureness of the city dweller a purposefulness in her stride a mischievous grin on her face
she continues toward the front door of a pet shop and enters
melanie opens the door and comes through still looking back toward the street and skywards
the proprietor a mrs
macgruder comes toward her
macgruder have you ever seen so many gulls
hello miss daniels
what do you suppose it is
macgruder takes a look out at the sky
a puppy is barking o
shaking her head there must be a storm at sea
that can drive them inland you know
they are climbing the short flight of steps into the bird department now
the barking of the dog segues into the clamor of innumerable birds tweeting twittering cawing as melanie and mrs
macgruder go to the counter at the far end
there is a circular cage in the center of the room and the walls are lined with wire mesh cages and smaller wooden cages so that the effect is one
of being surrounded by birds contained birds to be sure
the birds are quite beautiful mostly exotic birds small splashes of color behind the wire mesh cages larger bursts of brilliant hue on the parrots and parakeets in the bigger
as they walk i was hoping youd be a little late miss daniels
apologetically you see he hasnt arrived yet
you said three oclock
oh i know
she is more distressed now ive been calling all morning
oh you have no idea
miss daniels theyre so difficult to get really they are
we get them from india you know when theyre just little chicks and then we have to
well this one wont be a chick will he
this will be a full grown myna bird
and hell talk
well yes hell talk
well no no
youll have to teach him to talk
pause oh my i suppose i should call them again
they said three oclock
pause maybe its the traffic
would you mind waiting
judiciously i think maybe youd better deliver him
let me give you my address
she begins taking off her gloves producing pencil and pad oh
oh well all right
as melanie starts writing im sure theyre on the way though
could i just call
with a resigned sigh well all right but
she scurries out behind the counter and out of sight
melanie finishes writing her address and stands impatiently by the counter
she taps her teeth with the pencil
hello this is betty macgruder at davidsons
pause accusingly its past three you know
pause well how long do you think
all right would you check it please
yes ill wait
leaving her gloves and purse on the counter she begins wandering around the shop still tapping her lips with the pencil
there is no menace in the birds surrounding her
they are active and beautiful as they dart behind the bars and mesh of their cages
off screen the puppy begins barking again as the front door opens
melanie looks up
as he closes the entrance door behind him and starts up the steps to the bird department
he is a handsome man about twenty nine or thirty well dressed and carrying a felt hat
seeing him and then turning away to bend before the cage of strawberry finches
she pokes the pencil through the mesh
the birds are startled into scarlet flight
as they pass each other in the aisle
he gives a polite little nod and she gives a polite little smile
but as he passes her and unknown to her he turns for a second look and then vanishes behind the circular cage as he turns he corner
looking at her watch as she wanders around the other side of the cage and then comes face to face with mitch again
i wonder if you could help me
deliberately and with a touch of hauteur i said i wonder if you could help me
a trifle annoyed by his manner at first
she is about to inform him if you please that she is not a shopgirl
but then something rebellious flashes in her eyes and an idea comes to her
solicitously yes what was it you were looking for sir
i understand there are different varieties it that true
yes sir there are
these are for my sister
her birthday you see
as shell be eleven and
well frankly i wouldnt want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative
i understand completely sir
as the same time i wouldnt want birds that were aloof either
leading him around shop no of course not
do you have a pair that are just friendly
i think so sir
she looks around now then let me see
at the finches arent these lovebirds
no sir those are
the sign says strawberry finches
airily yes we call them that too
she moves away ahhh here we are lovebirds
and stops before a cage of canaries those are canaries miss
pause doesnt this make you feel awful
baffled doesnt what make me
all these innocent little creatures caged up like this
well we cant just let them fly around the shop you know
i suppose not
is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages
its to protect the species
i imagine thats very important
especially during the moulting season
yes thats a particularly dangerous time
are they moulting now
some of them are
how can you tell
they get a sort of hangdog expression
the bird is wearing a distinctly hangdog expression
yes i see
pause about those lovebirds miss
are you sure you wouldnt like to see a canary instead
we have some very nice canaries this week
he smiles she smiles back
he waits all right may i see one please
as she realizes she is expected to take one of the canaries out of the cage
she smiles feebly glances toward the counter where she expects mrs
macgruder to reappear momentarily and then takes a deep breath
she opens the door to the canary cage and cautiously puts her hand into it
feebly here birdie
here birdie birdie
one of the canaries suddenly flutters out of the cage and into the room
melanie leaps back startled
as the canary flies frantically about the room melanie and mitch in pursuit
macgruder appears at the counter finally confronted with the chaos shes been expecting all day
what is it
oh my one of the birds is loose
she joins in the chase around the room
the bird flutters up to the ceiling and then lands on the counter and watches them suspiciously
he tiptoes up to the bird hat in hand
quickly he covers the bird with his hat then reaches under to grab it
the canary in his hand
there we are
as mitch carries the canary back to the cage
he opens the door
putting the canary in back into your gilded cage melanie daniels
what did you say
savoring this i was merely drawing a parallel miss daniels
how do you know my name
secretly a little birdie told me
he smiles politely good day miss daniels
he bows to mrs
he starts out hey wait a minute
she goes after him
mitch turns stops smiles enjoying her bafflement immensely
melanie studies him
then i dont know you
ahhh but i know you
we met in court
we never met in court or anyplace else
ill rephrase it
i saw you in court
do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window
i didnt break that window
no but your little prank did
the judge should have put you behind bars
what are you
i simply believe in the law miss daniels and im not too keen on practical jokers
what do you call your lovebird story if not a practical
ahhh but i really do want those birds
you knew i didnt work here
i recognized you when i came in
i thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag
what do you think of that miss daniels
i think youre a louse
he tips his hat good day
and he goes down the steps and im glad you didnt get your lovebirds
breezily as he goes out ill find something else
he gives a slight bow see you in court some day
the door closes
the puppy begins barking
who was that
i have no idea
seething as she stares after him
suddenly she gets an idea
going down the steps and to the front door of the shop
she looks through the glass
getting into his car at the curb
looking after the car at the curb
seeing the plate giving a brief determined angry nod
she begins to repeat the numbers to herself as she turns
as she comes up the steps again and walks toward the counter
as she comes up to the counter
have you got a pencil
oh yes certainly
as melanie begins writing they said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon
if youd care to come back
no youd better send him
may i use your phone
bewildered by everything yes certainly
she puts phone on counter as she dials do you have any lovebirds
no not in the shop
but i can order them for you
well how soon would you want them
into phone is this the daily news
would you get me the city desk please
i might be able to have them by tomorrow morning
would that be all right
with an edged anger that would be just fine
into phone hello charlie this is melanie
i want you to do a favor for me
pause no this is a small one
pause pressure you
why charlie darling would i try to pressure you
will you call the department of motor vehicles for me and find out who owns this license plate
dkq dash one seven six
pause yes a california plate
pause no ill stop up there in a little while
is daddy in his office
no no i dont want to break in on a meeting
just tell him ill see him later
thank you charlie
she hangs up now
what time tomorrow morning
pulling up in front of mitchs building the top down
she glances up at the address gets out of the car comes around to the other side and opens the door
in a cage as melanie reaches for them
turning from the car and going into the building
she pauses in the lobby studies the names alongside the bell buttons
running down the list of names slowly
her finger beside it
close shot her gloved hand the forefinger extended as she runs it down over every bell button in one column and then does the same for the next column
as she turns from the bells to the inner door of the lobby grabbing the knob
a buzz sounds
she opens the door
coming through the door and into the lobby
she walks swiftly toward the elevator where a well dressed man is standing waiting
behind her the inner door is buzzing wildly with answering buzzes
melanie and the man stand waiting for the elevator silently
behind her the buzzing stops
the elevator doors open
the man smiles pleasantly and allows her to enter first
she does so with a small nod
the elevator doors close
the birds are chirping wildly in their cage
the man and melanie stand silently side by side
the mans eyes wander down to the bird cage
melanies eyes move toward him
self consciously she stands with the cage of chattering birds
the man is dead panned unsmiling
the elevator stops
the doors begin to open
stepping out of the elevator as the doors open
the man is right behind her
she begins looking for apartment b
the man is walking down the corridor beside her
she stops in front of the apartment hesitates hoping the man will turn the corner in the corridor
instead he stops at the apartment just opposite
he begins fumbling in his pocket for his key
he looks at melanie
smiling at him feebly
the man spread change and an assortment of junk on the palm of his hand as he searches for his key
impatiently melanie watches him
making a decision she puts the birdcage down before the door to apartment b and then opens her purse
reaching into the purse for a white envelope
written there in melanies handwriting mr
as she props the envelope against the cage and then hurriedly goes down the hallway intent on retreat
she stops distressed
the man at the one end key in his hand melanie at the other end near the elevator
is that for mitch brenner
hes not home
thats all right
she presses button for the elevator
he wont be back until monday
i mean if those birds are for him
i dont think you should leave them in the hall do you
trapped well i
the elevator doors open
well where did he go
he goes up there every weekend
up on the coast
about sixty miles north of here
her face falls oh
about an hour and a half on the freeway
or two if you take the coast highway
id hold the birds for him but im going away myself
someones got to feed them i suppose
in utter despair now yes
yes someones got to feed them
apologetically im awfully sorry
he puts the key into his lock opens the door and goes inside
the door closes
melanie is alone in the hallway
she looks at the open elevator
she turns to look at the birds
in their cage outside the apartment door chattering
surrendering with a gesture of resignation
she walks down the hall picks up envelope and puts it in her purse picks up the bird cage carries it back to the elevator
the birds are cooing and chirping madly
oh shut up
and she steps into the elevator
on the coast highway
it is a spectacularly beautiful day with a cloudless blue sky
the montage of shots that follow should alternate between the winding twisting road and the ocean below and closeups of melanie driving with the caged birds on the seat beside
the last shot should be a full shot of the car rounding a particularly sharp curve
she turns wheel forcefully
in the cage as the car rounds the bend
they lean to one side as the car turns come up straight again as the car rounds the curve
car approaching bodega bay seen high up
at the wheel she glances out toward the bay
ahead through the windshield as the car approaches
behind the wheel leaning forward slightly for a look at the town
through the windshield as melanie slows her speed
on right of the road as melanie enters the town
slow pan matching cars cruise past bakery shoe repair cleaners behind wheel
past the gas station and beyond to the parking area and the docks continuing melanies slow observation of the place
studying the town
the car turns into road by gas station
through the windshield
the car turns right
there is life in the town now fishermen crossing the road women with their hair in curlers old ladies carrying shopping bags
this is saturday morning and the town such as it is is alive with its inhabitants
we see them from melanies pulling in in front of the post office
melanie opens the door and steps out
she is smartly dressed in a traveling suit and sweater
she looks up at the sign and then walks quickly toward the front door
enters post office
behind cage as melanie approaches it
he is busy filling out a form of some kind affixing stamps to it etc
he does not look up as she approaches
through the bars of the cage
without looking up morning
i wonder if you could help me
try my best
im looking for a man named mitchell brenner
he is still busy with his form still does not look up
do you know him
where does he live
yes but where
right across the bay there
it seems as if the clerk will not answer her
suddenly he leaves the window
through the bars exasperated
as she tries to peek through the bars to see where hes vanished
a door to the left of the window opens and the clerk steps out
he walks a little distance as melanie watches him then stops turns and looks at her surprised as if hed expected her to be right behind him
he stands stock still looking at her saying nothing
she understands then that he wants her to follow him and she catches up neither speaking
they go to the front door
he opens it looks at her then looks out across the town and the bay
he extends his arm and points
see where im pointing
see them two big trees across there
and the white house
thats where the brenners live
nope just lydia and the two kids
the two kids
mitch and the little girl
how do i get down there
follow the road straight through town til it curves off on the left
thatll take you right around the bay to their front door
the front door
pause isnt there a back road i can take
thats the road
straight through town stay on your left right around the bay to the front door
you see i wanted to surprise them
i didnt want to come right down the road where they could see me
its a surprise you see
long pause course you could get yourself a boat cut right across the bay with it
the brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at
if thats what you wanted to do
where would i get a boat
down at the dock by the tides restaurant
ever handled an outboard boat
looking at him of course
looks back at her dyou want me to order one for you
surprised thank you
he nods briefly and goes inside
melanie looks across the bay
she gets a new idea
she reaches into her purse for the envelope
she looks at the envelope then tears it up and stuffs the torn envelope into her handbag
she turns back toward the post office
as melanie approaches the clerks window
he is still busy still does not look up
i wonder if you could tell me
the little girls name
the little brenner girl
alice i think
he turns shouts to someone in rear harry whats the little brenner girls name
shouting the little brenner girl
shouting its alice aint it
shouting no its lois
to melanie its alice
are you sure
well i aint positive if thats what you mean
i need her exact name you see
that case i tell you what you do
you go straight through town til you see a little hotel on your left there
not the motel thats the other end of town
this is the hotel
now you take a right turn there you got that
near the top of the hill youll see the school and right behind it the church
you head for the school
now just past the school youll see a little house with a red mail box
thats where annie hayworth lives shes the school teacher
you ask her about the little brenner girl
pause could save yourself a lot of trouble
her names alice for sure
can i have the boat in about twenty minutes
the clerk nods
how much for the phone calls
brushing this aside its nothing
grinning as she makes for the door and exits
getting into the car and slamming the door
long shot matte melanies car turning in school road
passing the school and pulling up outside the teachers house
with the name hayworth on it
pull back to reveal passing the mail box and going up the walk to the front door
the house is a two story frame with steps leading to the front door
there are white curtains in every window of the house and a sign in the window to the left of the doorway advises room to let
melanie rings the doorbell
she rings the bell again shouting yes
who is it
walking along the porch of the house
the walk in front of the house is lined with beautifully planted and cared for flowers
annie hayworth comes round from the back of the house as melanie reaches the corner
she is a woman of thirty two tall big boned with a strong beautiful face
her hair is disarrayed at the moment and she is dressed for the garden wearing slacks and a loose fitting sweater and earth stained gloves
but there is something about her a feeling of expansive comfort rather than sloppiness
im melanie daniels
im sorry to bother you but
she is puzzled by melanie who exquisitely dressed and groomed seems singularly out of place in bodega bay
she studies her openly
the man at the post office sent me
he said youd know the name of the little brenner girl
the one who lives in the white house across the bay
thats the one
smiling they seemed sure it was either alice or lois
which is why the mail in this town never gets delivered to the right place
she takes out package of cigarettes offers one to melanie did you want to see cathy about something
taking cigarette hesitating
studying her thinking she understands
are you a friend of mitchs
no not really
there is an awkwardness here
annie wants to know more
she puffs on the cigarette smiles tries a friendly approach
ive been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes but i couldnt convince myself to stop
this tilling of the soil can get a little compulsive you know
its a lovely garden
it gives me something to do with my spare time
pause theres a lot of spare time in bodega bay
another pause did you plan on staying long
just a few hours
youre leaving after you see cathy
something like that
pause im sorry
i dont mean to sound so mysterious
actually its none of my business
there is a pause
melanie by her silence affirms that it is none of annies business
putting out cigarette id better get on my way
thank you very much
not at all
they begin walking toward the car
still curious did you drive up from san francisco
its a nice drive
pause is that where you met mitch
hesitating then yes
i guess thats where everyone meets him
as she gets in behind the wheel
annies remark is not lost on her and a quick look of sudden understanding crosses her face
now you sound a bit mysterious miss hayworth
as annie leans over the seat
she shakes her head smiles wistfully no im an open book im afraid
pause or maybe a closed one
she smiles again sees the lovebirds pretty
what are they
taking this as a further indication of melanies relationship with mitch mmm
pause well good luck miss daniels
she nods pleasantly starts the car pulls away
watching the car a look of sad resignation on her face
coming out of brinkmeyers general store carrying a small paper bag walking toward her car out front
the camera follows her as she gets in
she opens her purse and reaches in for the paper bag
she pulls out a birthday card from the paper bag
reaching into her purse again for a fountain pen
she unscrews the cap braces the card on her closed purse
happy birthday the usual rhyming sentiments
the pen writes to cathy crossing the highway down into the parking area behind the tides close to the docks
she gets out of the car and walks onto one of the docks the bird cage in her hand
melanie approaches a waiting fisherman
she asks for her boat
the fisherman nods
he leads her to the dock and the waiting boat
she gets into the outboard motorboat the fisherman helping her
he hands down the lovebirds in their cage
pulling away from the dock heading across the bay
and the wide expanse of the bay as it heads on a direct course for the house on the other side
another spectacular shot of the small boat
coming head on toward camera melanie at the tiller
she cuts the motor
the motor drifts to a stop
the bay is silent except for the cry of the gulls
there is not a sign of activity as the boat drifts just a little closer
as melanie watches the front door opens and a woman comes out walks to a red pickup truck starts the engine
a little girl comes out of the house goes to the truck gets in
the woman shouts something to a man mitch brenner probably though it is difficult to tell from this distance and he comes over to the truck
the truck grinds into gear goes around the turnabout and heads down the road away from the farm a huge cloud of dust behind it
the farm is still again
mitch stands looking after the truck for a moment and then begins walking up toward the barn in the distance
watching biting her lip
mitch reaching the barn and entering
not a sign of life
picking up paddle from deck beginning to paddle in toward dock
edging in toward the dock
closer closer melanie puts down the paddle
the boat drifts in
leaping ashore tying up the boat reaching down for the cage
she climbs onto the dock and approaches the camera until she is in waist shot
the camera starts to recede in front of her as she walks forward
the barn door closed still no sign of mitch
coming off the dock and onto the lawn the camera still retreating in front of her
she makes her way carefully across the lawn glancing toward the barn carrying the bird cage
crossing the lawn the camera retreating in front of her
camera retreating in front of her excitement and anticipation on her face
she wets her lips
the camera pans with her as she goes to front door and lets herself in
as the door opens
melanie enters quickly and closes the door behind her
she glances around for a moment getting her bearings
the house is silent
entering the dining room
hastily she puts the cage on the dinning room table props the card up against it then glances through the lace curtains on the dinning room window
as the front door opens and melanie emerges
camera pans and follows her back down front walk
melanie glances over her shoulder toward the barn
mitch has not emerged
camera continues moving on melanies back toward the end of the dock
melanie again glances over her shoulder toward the barn
further along the dock toward the barn
still no mitch
camera continues on her back for a short distance and stops as melanie continues to the end of the dock and climbs into the boat
camera continues on her back for a short distance and stops as melanie continues to the end of the dock and climbs into the boat
camera follows melanie as she paddles away from the dock
as she looks toward the house and barn
she starts to duck down
as mitch emerges from the barn and goes toward the house
he goes inside
peering over the stern of the boat
mitch dashes out of the front door and looks around
as she watches mitch
as mitch runs back into the house
peering over stern of the boat
as he emerges from the front door and raises binoculars
as he looks towards melanies boat through the binoculars
the bay is reflected in the glass
she is pulling at the cord which starts the motor
she sits down and grabs the tiller
she looks back over her shoulder as the boat moves away
he is smiling with amused recognition he lowers the binoculars and dashes out of frame
the camera is moving with her as she looks toward mitch
mitch is running for his car
the car door slams
the engine starts
the car practically leaps out of the driveway
as she watches the car race along the shore
mitchs car racing along the shore
she looks off right toward car
mitchs car racing along the shore road turns inland at keesport
melanie looks camera right her eyes slowly turn camera left
mitchs car races past wrecked ferry boat
her head continues to turn camera left
she looks off and sees moves forward slower
mitch drives onto dock gets out of the car and stands waiting
partially posing for mitch her hair blowing in the wind her head tilted back a smile on her face
swooping down from upper lefthand corner of frame to lower as gull strikes the back of her head
she recoils and looks up with shock and pain
the gull soars away from lower righthand corner of frame to reacting to the sudden attack and looking after receding gull
blood is starting down her temple from her hair
as the boat comes closer
the boat drifts in toward a second boat tied up at the dock
mitch crosses the docked boat leaps into melanies boat
in the boat
that was the damndest thing i ever saw
what made it
it deliberately came down at you youre bleeding
a thin line of blood trickling from the cut on top of her head down onto her forehead and cheek
she seems dazed
she shakes her head in answer to him then touches the top of her head looks at her bloody fingers and then nods weakly
come on lets take care of that
as they climb onto it
a fisherman standing by looks at melanie curiously
what happened mitch
over his shoulder a gull hit her
the camera follows them as they walk across the parking area behind the tides and to the closest office
mitch tries the door knob
the door is locked
as he tries door of next office
it too is locked
come on wed better go up to the restaurant
they walk quickly up the slope to the tides establishing gas station across the road the collection of stores opposite the cars pulling in and out
mitch opens the door for her and they enter
this is a small neighborhood restaurant with the feeling of a local hangout
there are fishermen lounging at the bar and a teenage boy playing one of the pinball machines
two ladies in housedresses with their hair in curlers are sitting at one of the booths having coffee
the rear wall of the restaurant is almost all window looking out over the bay and the parking area below
a television set over the bar is going
the shots and horsehoof beats of an old western movie should be heard muted throughout following
deke carter who owns the restaurant with his wife alternates his attention between serving his customers and watching the western
he looks up immediately when mitch and melanie enter
mitch and melanie coming over to it
deke have you got a first aid kit back there
instantly alarmed what happened
young woman cut herself
shall i call the doctor
accepting the first aid kit i dont think its that serious
you want to sit up here
melanie climbs onto the stool
you cut yourself outside miss
stop worrying deke
she was in a boat
he is rummaging around in the kit
i had a man trip and fall in the parking lot once sued me before i could bat an eyelash
i dont think miss daniels is going to sue anybody
doubtfully well youre the lawyer
goes to other end of bar as he unscrews cap from bottle of peroxide
just some peroxide
i want to clean out the cut
he pours peroxide onto a gauze pad and begins swabbing the cut
they are silent for several seconds
then so youre a lawyer
what are you doing in bodega bay
do you practice here
no san francisco
what are you
what kind of law
is that why youd like to see everyone behind bars
not everyone miss daniels
only violators and practical jokers
as he swabs cut
pause what are you doing up here
didnt you see the lovebirds
you came all the way up here to bring me those birds
to bring your sister those birds
you said it was her birthday
besides i was coming up anyway
to see a friend of mine
she winces will you please be careful
pause whos your friend
pause stymied yes
blurting the only name she knows annie
well well small world
realizing this was a mistake yes
how do you know annie
the lie getting deeper we
we went to school together
how long will you be staying
just a few
just a day or two
i think well have to shave the hair
deke have you got a razor
pulling away oh no you dont
its still bleeding a little
here let me put this on
he takes up a tiny band aid and tearing the gauze off says bend your head down
this little band aid wont show
he presses the tiny band aid over the cut
melanie takes a mirror from her handbag and bending her head down looks at it
she covers her hair over it as mitch says so you came up to see annie huh
i dont believe you
grins i think you came up to see me
why would i want to see you of all people
shrugging i dont know
but it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who i was and where i lived and
it was no trouble at all
i simply called my fathers paper
besides i was coming up here anyway i already told you
grinning you like me huh
i loathe you
you have no manners
and youre arrogant and conceited and
i wrote you a letter about it in fact but i tore it up
what did it say
none of your business
pause am i still bleeding
she lowers her head
cant see a thing
i cant say i like your seagulls much either
i come all the way up here to
but you were coming up anyway remember
and all i get for my pains is a
a hole in the head
grinning right next to the one you already had
angrily look mr
they turn toward the door
closing the door behind her coming toward the bar
she is a woman in her late forties attractive wearing shirt blouse cardigan sweater low heels
there is nothing agrarian looking about her
she speaks with the quick tempo of the city dweller and there is lively inquiry in her eyes
puzzled i thought i saw your car
what are you doing in town
rising to greet her i had to acknowledge a delivery
grins mother id like you to meet
continuing melanie daniels
melanie my mother
her eyebrows raising ever so slightly not in displeasure but simply in enormous curiosity as she acknowledge the introduction
how do you do miss daniels
to mitch acknowledge a what

lydia looks at mitch inquiringly

lydia stares at her doubtfully
melanie is standing on the front steps a paper bag in her hands
she rings the doorbell
the room to let sign is still in the window
the door suddenly opens
surprised oh hi
pause did you find her all right
yes i did
there is a long awkward pause
annie smiles expectantly at melanie
melanie seems hesitant
i was wondering
pause do you think i could have the room for a single night
well id really hope to rent it for
i would appreciate it
ive tried everywhere in town and theyre all full
after a pause sure
you can have it
smiles wheres your bag
in the car
melanie holds up the paper bag
annie looks at it and then smiles
its utilitarian ill say that for it
smiling i just picked up some things for the night at the general store
you see i hadnt planned on spending much time here
yes i know
did something unexpected crop up
there is a moment where both women look at each other
when melanie answers it is abrupt and a trifle cold she is again telling annie to mind her own business
pause may i use your phone
id like to call home
there is another moment where annie appraises melanies attitude and then accepts it
she suddenly smiles warmly
why dont you come in then
i was just about to mix a martini
she is about to lead melanie into the house when they both hear a sound overhead
they turn to look skyward
flying in beautiful precise formation against the sky
shaking her head dont they ever stop migrating
but melanie is watching the sky and the birds with a curiously serious expression
long shot the approach road to the brenner house
melanies car is driving along the shore
behind her the sky is stained with sunset
there are gulls on the bay cawing into the silence
as it pulls into the brenner yard
reaching up for the rear view mirror tilting it to examine her lipstick touching the edge of her mouth with one hand
she gets out of the car camera following her to the house
she climbs the porch steps knocks on the door
there is no answer
puzzled she begins walking back into the yard
in the distance she sees mitch lydia and cathy coming from behind the chicken sheds
she raises her arm in greeting
in the distance
mitch and cathy raise their arms
she breaks into a trot toward melanie close shot cathy as she approaches
she is an eleven year old child clear eyed bright uninhibited wearing a shirt and blouse her hair cropped close to her head
she hesitates for just a moment
and cathy flings herself into melanies arms almost knocking her off her feet hugging her fiercely
theyre just what i wanted
is there a man and a woman
i cant tell which is which
well i suppose
coming up hi
annie had no plans huh
im glad you came
are you hungry
dinners just about ready
explaining we were out back looking at the chickens
something seems to be wrong with them
going toward house theres nothing wrong with those chickens mitch
im going to call fred brinkmeyer right now
as they follow into house i dont know what good thatll do
aside to melanie chickens wont eat
as they enter camera following them throughout into dining room where lydia dials phone talking to mitch all along
he sold the feed to me didnt he
caviat emptor mother
let the buyer beware
whose side are you on
im simply quoting the law
never mind the law
cathy you can start serving the soup
she has finished dialing now is waiting while the phone this wont take a minute miss dan
into phone hello fred
this is lydia brenner
i didnt interrupt your dinner did pause fred that feed you sold me is no good
pause the chicken feed
the three bags i brought
holding the telephone
well its just no good
the chickens wont eat it
pause theyre always hungry fred
i opened one of the sacks when i got home and i poured it out for them and they wouldnt touch it
now you know chickens as well as i do and when they wont eat theres just something wrong with what theyre being fed thats all
pause no theyre not fussy chickens
whats he got to do with it
pause fred i dont care how much feed you sold him
pause he did
pause this afternoon
pause well that only proves what im saying
the feed you sold us is

maybe i ought to go over to see him
you dont think theres something going around do you
pause no never
pause no fred they dont seem sick at all
they just wont eat
well ill try to get over to dans farm
all right fred thanks
she hangs up puzzled as lydia comes to the table
mitch and melanie are sitting opposite each other in the center chairs
cathy is serving the last bowl of soup
as she sits he got a call from dan fawcett a little while ago
his chickens wont eat either
its what you said mom
brinkmeyers feed is no good
slowly no cathy
he sold mr
fawcett a different brand
extremely worried you dont think theyre getting sick do you mitch
her eyes troubled as she picks up her napkin
the meal is over
the lovebirds in their hanging cage have been covered for the night
in the b
mitch and lydia are carrying the stacked dishes to the kitchen
in the f
cathy and melanie are by a small upright piano
melanie is playing a debussy arabesque she picks up a cigarette from the ashtray now and again to take a puff
i still dont understand how you knew i wanted lovebirds
your brother told me
as she goes into kitchen then you knew mitch in san francisco is that right
no not exactly
mitch knows lots of people in san francisco
of course theyre mostly hoods
from the kitchen cathy
well mom hes the first to admit it
to melanie he spends half his day in the detention cells at the hall of justice
coming from kitchen in a democracy cathy everyone is entitled to a fair trial
your brothers practice
mom please i know all the democracy jazz
theyre still hoods
to melanie hes got a client now who shot his wife in the head six times
six times can you imagine it
she starts for living room i mean even twice would be overdoing it dont you think
to mitch as he carries load of dishes out why did he shoot her
he was watching a ball game on television
his wife changed the channel
he goes into kitchen
melanie interrupts her playing to take another puff at her cigarette
is smoking fun
oh i suppose so
could i have a puff
i dont think your mother would like that
just a little one
they both glance conspiratorially toward the kitchen
quickly melanie extends the cigarette
quickly cathy takes a small puff
delighted why its just like air isnt it
determined when i grow up im gonna smoke like a chimney
ill be eleven tomorrow you know
are you coming to my party
i dont think so
seeing the childs face i have to get back to san francisco
dont you like us
touching her hair darling of course i do
dont you like bodega bay
i dont know yet
mitch likes it very much
he comes up every weekend you know even though he has his own apartment in the city
he says san francisco is just an ant hill at the foot of a bridge
smiling i guess it does get a little hectic at times
if you do decide to come dont say i told you about it
its supposed to be a surprise party
you see theyve got this whole complicated thing figured out where im going over to micheles for the afternoon and micheles mother is going to say she has a headache
and would i mind very much if she took me home
then when we get back here all of the kidsll jump out
pause wont you come
wont you please come
shaking her head glancing toward the kitchen
i dont think so cathy
mitch is helping her as she loads the dishwasher
shes a charming girl isnt she mitch
and certainly pretty
how long have you known her
i told you
we met yesterday
in a bird shop
she was selling birds
i only led her into believing i believed she was
mother its really very complicated
but she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way
mother where did you go to law school
laughing forgive me
i suppose im just naturally curious about a girl like that
pause shes very rich isnt she
i suppose so
her father owns a big newspaper in san francisco
youd think he could manage to keep her name out of print
shes always mentioned in the columns mitch
i know mother
she is the one who jumped into that fountain in rome last summer isnt she
perhaps im old fashioned
pause i know it was supposed to be very warm there mitch but
well the newspaper said she was naked
i know mother
its none of my business of course but when you bring a girl like that to
looking up yes
i think i can handle melanie daniels by myself
she sighs so long as you know what you want mitch
i know exactly what i want mother
as mitch and melanie cross it to her car
a wind is blowing off the water and high fast clouds are scudding across the face of the moon
youll be able to find your way back wont you
will i be seeing you again
san franciscos a long way from here
im in san francisco five days a week
with a lot of time on my hands
id like to see you
he grins maybe we could go swimming or something
mother tells me you like to swim
how does mother know what i like to do
i guess she and i read the same gossip columns
i like to swim
we might get along very
in case youre interested i was pushed into that fountain
without any clothes on
with all my clothes on
the newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my fathers paper
anything they said
you were just a poor innocent victim of circumstance huh
im neither poor nor innocent but the truth of that particular
the truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd
who didnt much care for propriety or convention or
the opinions of others and you went right along with them isnt that the truth
yes thats the truth
but i was pushed into that fountain and thats the truth too
do you really know annie hayworth
pause at least i didnt until i came up here
so you didnt go to school together
and you didnt come up here to see her
you were lying
yes i was lying
did you really write a letter to me
or was that a lie too
i wrote the letter
what did it say
it said dear mr
brenner i think you need those lovebirds after all
they may help your personality
thats what it said
but you tore it up
because it seemed stupid and foolish
like jumping into a fountain in rome
i told you what happened in rome
do you expect me to believe
i dont give a damn what you believe
angrily she gets into the car is about to slam the door when mitch catches it in his hands
id still like to see you
i think it could be fun
pulling the door shut
that might have been good enough in rome last summer
but its not good enough now
it is for me
but not for me
what do you want
angrily sarcastic i thought you knew
i want to go through life laughing and beautiful and jumping into fountains naked
as it pulls away
mitch yanks his hands back from the door
as he watches the car leave
the car turns the bend and disappears
only the long line of telephone poles and wires and
something strange on the wires
his attention caught by the poles and wires
hundreds of birds sitting on them
standing and watching
a wind blows off the water
he shivers suddenly turns up his collar and heads for the house
in an easy chair reading
she is wearing a robe and smoking absorbed in her book
she turns when she hears the front miss daniels
is that you
annie rises to greet her
as melanie enters the shot hi
seeing her face is something wrong
is that cut beginning to bother you
touching her head no its not the cut thats bothering me
concerned would you like some brandy
if you have some id
ill get it sit down miss daniels
do you want a sweater or something
as annie gets the brandy no thank you
pause wont you call me melanie
she smiles med
shot melanie sitting tucking her legs up under her
she is disturbed by her conversation with mitch and in fact by the way this entire trip has worked out
annie brings her the glass of brandy and she takes it gratefully
sitting opposite her it gets a little chilly here at night sometimes
especially if youre over near the bay
melanie nods and sips at the brandy
there is a long pause
well howd your evening go
did you meet lydia
or would you rather i changed the subject
with a tired smile i think so
nodding how do you like our little hamlet
i despise it
laughing well i dont suppose it offers much to the casual visitor
unless youre thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside
it takes a while to get used to
where are you from originally annie
howd you happen to come here
oh someone invited me up for the weekend a long time ago
there is an awkward pause
look i see no reason for being coy about this
it was mitch brenner
i guess you knew that anyway
i suspected as much
you neednt worry
its over and done with
a long time ago
annie theres nothing between mitch and me
she shrugs maybe there isnt
maybe theres never anything between mitch and any girl
what do you mean
i think ill have some of that too
she pours brandy drinks sighs i was seeing quite a lot of him in san francisco you know
she smiles weakly and then one weekend he asked me up to meet lydia
when was this
four years ago
of course that was shortly after his father died
things may be different now
pause did she seem a trifle distant
smiling a trifle
then maybe it isnt different at all
you know her attitude nearly drove me crazy
i simply couldnt understand it
when i got back to san francisco i spent days trying to figure out just what id done to displease her
and what had you done
i simply existed
so what was the answer
a jealous woman right
a clinging possessive mother
she shakes her head wrong
with all due respect to oedipus i dont think that was the case at all
then what was it
lydia liked me you see
that was the strange part of it
in fact now that im no longer a threat were very good friends
then why did she object to you
because she was afraid
afraid youd take mitch
afraid id give mitch
i dont understand
afraid of any woman whod give mitch the only thing lydia can give him love
annie that adds up to a jealous possessive woman
no i dont think so
shes not afraid of losing her son you see
shes only afraid of being abandoned
someone ought to tell her shed be gaining a daughter
she already has a daughter
what about mitch
didnt he have anything to say about this
apologetically i can understand his position
he went through a lot with lydia after his father died
he didnt want to risk going through it all over again
so it ended
not immediately of course
i went back to san francisco and i still saw mitch every now and then
but we both knew it was finished
then what are you doing here in bodega bay
you get straight to the point dont you
no thats all right i dont mind
i came up here for two reasons
to begin with i was bored with my job in san francisco
i was teaching at a private school there
well you know you probably went to one yourself
then you know
little girls in brown beanies
here i have a life
ill go into that classroom on monday morning and ill look out at twenty five upturned little faces and each of them will be saying yes please give me what
pause and ill give them what i have
i havent got very much but ill give them every ounce of it
to me thats very important
it makes me want to stay alive for a long long time
she sighs thats the first reason
and the second
simply i wanted to be near mitch
pause it was over and i knew it but i wanted to be near him anyway
she smiles you see i still like him a hell of a lot
thats rare i think
i dont want to lose his friendship
there is a moment of silence
into the silence the telephone shrills
annie hesitates a moment and then goes to answer it
at the phone
no no i wasnt asleep
what is it
pause yes just a little while ago
sure hold on
she turns to melanie its mitch
as they stare at each other across the room melanie hesitating
melanie rises and goes to the phone
the camera follows annie to the wing chair in the foreground and stays on her throughout following recording her reactions as melanie talks to mitch in the background
annie is not devastated by this call and yet there is a wistfulness to her expression as she realizes she may finally and irrevocably be losing mitch to another girl
at phone coolly hello
yes this is melanie
fine thank you
no no trouble at all
i simply followed the road
its a very bright night
well theres no need to apologize
i can understand
pause she listens well
she listens again thats very kind of you
no im not angry
she listens i couldnt
im afraid i have to get back to san francisco
pause no i wouldnt want to disappoint cathy but
pause i see
she is warming i see
well if you really
pause all right
yes ill be there
pause good night mitch
she hangs up and looks at annie in embarrassment
he wants me to go to cathys party tomorrow afternoon
pause i said i would
ill be going too to help out
it should be fun melanie
it seems so pointless
she sighs i think ill go to sleep
this has been a busy day
picking up her paper bag my luggage
she smiles takes out a flowered muumuu holds it up to annie
did you get that at brinkmeyers
melanie nods and drapes the muumuu over her arm
she is silent for a moment pensive
then do you think i should go
thats up to you
its really up to lydia isnt it
never mind lydia
do you want to go
the room is silent
melanie nods slowly and then smiles
thank you annie
suddenly into the silence comes a thump at the door startling them both
rising who can that be at this hour
she walks to door who is it
no answer is someone there
melanie goes to stand beside annie
puzzled annie unlocks the door and then opens it
she looks out into the night
there is nothing but the sound of the wind
to the emptiness outside is anyone there
pointing to the ground look
oh the poor thing
he probably lost his way in the dark
who stares at the dead bird as annie stoops to pick it up
and then slowly but
it isnt dark annie
theres a full moon
as annie stooping looks up at her
on their puzzlement and consternation high shot the brenner house the place is decorated with balloons strung from the house to various points on the lawn
the children in party clothes with their parents are clustered around a long folding table upon which are sandwiches ice cream and soft drinks
the parents are either helping the children to more or telling them they are having too much
there is a general sound of kids chatter and laughter
coming up the sloping path away from the party are melanie and mitch
the camera pans them up the slope and away from the party in background
as they turn the hairpin bend of the slope and come up toward the camera we see the entrance of the harbor and the pacific in the background
the camera pans them as they come near to us and once more the party is in the background
mitch and melanie pass the camera out to the left
melanie and mitch come into the picture from the right and stand against the sky
mitch takes a martini shaker from one of his pockets and two glasses from the other
he hands one of the glasses to melanie and then pours
i really shouldnt have any more
im a little tipsy already
im trying to get you to stay for dinner
were going to have a lot of roast left over
i couldnt possibly
i have to get back
with a shrug cheers
whats in this
why do you have to rush off
whats so important in san francisco
i have to get to work tomorrow morning for one thing
surprised you have a job
sipping at the martini i have several jobs
what do you do
i do different things on different days
hesitating on mondays and wednesdays i work for the travelers aid
at the airport
she hesitates for a moment thinking
she has never really considered before what she does with her time and now that she is accounting for it it sounds a little meaningless and unimportant
and on tuesdays i take a course in general semantics at berkeley
thats not a job of course
i just take it because
what about thursdays and fridays
on thursdays i have my meeting and lunch
pause im chairman of a group thats sending a little korean boy through school
we plan how to raise funds and
things like that
she shrugs and fridays
what do you do then
she smiles i go to bird shops on fridays
im glad you do
do you know what i was doing in that shop
i have an aunt you see
shes seventy years old and veddy prim and strait laced
she does an imitation shes coming back from europe at the end of the month and im going to give her a myna bird thatll talk to her
whatll it say
facetiously youll think me very bold sir
no tell me
she leans over and whispers in his ear
they both burst out laughter
but then suddenly a very serious look comes into melanies face
thats silly isnt it
teaching a bird to shock my aunt
thats just silly and childish
slight pause maybe i ought to go join the other children
as she moves abruptly away from him and starts toward where the children have begun playing blind mans bluff
mitch stares after her for a moment moved by this sudden glimpse of character and then follows her down the dune
the children are all in a circle
annie is busy changing the blindfold from michele to cathy
the camera is now on the lawn pointing up toward dunes
we see mitch and melanie descending
they are coming down by way of a short cut and are not on the zig zag path
as they reach the lawn they move along the side of it at the foot of the dunes
they are absorbed in each other
the camera pans off them and bring into the picture annie surrounded by the children
she is in the act of changing the blindfold from michele to cathy
she hands michele her glasses back
during this and while she is putting the blindfold round the eyes of cathy she is looking to her right and obviously is watching mitch and melanie
camera moves a little to her left camera right
at this moment in the background lydia is emerging with the birthday cake
the candles on it are unlit
lydia immediately also catches sight of mitch and melanie and she slows up somewhat as she walks to the long table her eyes still on the couple
during this we see annie in the foreground sending cathy off
all right then here we go
she spins her once
she spins her again twice
she spins her again three
go get em cathy
she says all this while still looking toward the couple
she turns her head away from the couple with a new expression on her face
she twists completely around to look at lydia as though she were wondering if lydia sees what she sees
suddenly we hear a little boys voice crying look
annie swings round and the camera rushes into her face as she looks up
a gull is swooping down
as she changes her tactics stops dead and then cautiously reaches out in front of her at the air
the gull suddenly swoops at her hitting her shoulder
no touching allowed
she almost falls
seen from cathys position
he flies off cycles and then returns
reacting to gull
she turns her head back to cathy
reacting to the gull hitting cathy
they start towards cathy
with cathy and the children around
the camera pans down as she ducks with two gulls swooping by
hurriedly putting the cake onto the table
she rushes round to the front of it
annie rising from the ground
cathy and the other children are running in the background
reacting to two more gulls diving
diving toward the children
she starts to run out camera right
she pushes her to the ground as a gull attacks
as a gull swoops between them
coming out of the house with a broom
swooping down at the childrens heads
swinging at gull and missing
running toward bank
gull swooping after him
falling forward against the bank as the gull smashes into him
running to the injured boy who is lying against the bank
they look up
against the sky flying away in formation
about to swing with the broom again but the birds are no longer there
a puzzled look crosses his face
he turns to melanie
are you all right
coming over thats the darnest thing thing ive ever seen in my life
are they gone
theyre gone mother
as the children begin drifting back toward the table and the cake
there is the curious feeling of lighting having struck very close by without having injured anyone
all that adrenaline has boiled up and now it has no place to go
well is everyone all right
with a small boy i think he got a little scratch mother
did you see them
they were hawks
they were bigger than hawks
children they were only seagulls
and then the meaning of what she has just said strikes her and she remembers the bird hitting her door the night before
as annie turns to look at her and they exchange a silent meaningful glance
they must have been after the food mother
they all turn toward the table
they didnt touch anything
trying to restore order well theyre gone now so
pause who was it
you were it werent you cathy
can i be it miss hayworth
as annie and the children begin the game behind them
you look a little shaken
pause mitch is
mitch this isnt usual is it
the gull yesterday when i was in the boat and the one last night at annies and now
what do you mean
a gull smashed into annies front door
concerned i dont know melanie
pause look do you have to go back to annies
no i have my things in the car
gently then stay and have something to eat before you start back
id feel a lot better
she nods and then looks up at the sky
suddenly she shudders
he is slicing the leftover roast beef
putting the meat onto plate turning over his shoulder to call into living room
the lovebirds in their cage are making a terrible racket
do you want some mustard with this
no thank you
coming from kitchen why didnt annie stay for dinner
she said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back east
where dyou want the coffee
take it into the living room would you hon
seeing the birds whats the matter with them
lydia turns from a side table where she is cutting some french bread
whats the matter with all the birds
she covers the cage
under the cover the birds are still tweeting madly
lydia stares at the covered cage for a moment and then signs heavily
hurry up with the rest mitch
im sure miss daniels wants to get on her way
as she moves into the living room
i think you ought to stay the night melanie
a sharp look at her daughter
pouring coffee into the cups set on coffee table
weve got an extra room upstairs and everything
coming in with two plates that road can be a bad one at night melanie
he picks up coffee cup hands it to melanie they are now all eating with plates on their knees buffet style
if i go across to santa rosa ill come onto the freeway much earlier
picking up a cup yeah and the freeways well lighted isnt it mitch
yeah but shell be hitting all that traffic going back to san francisco
did you put the cover on that cage mom
yes i did
just listen to them
to melanie some cream
ill get it
she reaches over for the cream pitcher
her eye is caught by something in the fireplace
a single swift is sitting on the hearth
turning to mitch
as dozens of swifts begin pouring from the opening
shouting it mitch
hundreds of birds pouring into the room
shrieking in terror dropping her coffee cup
full of birds swooping diving
mitch runs to the door throws it open
to the others get outside
he turns toward lydia close shot lydia in terror surrounded by birds
wrenching the cloth from the coffee table cups coffee pot sugar bowl creamer falling to the floor as he swings the cloth at the birds
covering her face
reaching for small fireplace broom
shrieking as the birds dive at her face
realizing its impossible to run
they must stay and fight
shouting cathy get some matches
running for the kitchen
birds swooping after her
swinging the fireplace broom
rushing to the fireplace
he is almost knocked over by birds coming out of the opening
he stuffs paper under the logs already in place there
she lets out a horrified scream
there are birds fluttering in her hair caught there
swinging the broom covered with birds
an enlargement of a photograph of cathy smiling
as a bird flutters against it
running into the room covering her face with bent arm rushing to mitch with the box of matches
taking the matches
he lights one
a bird hits his arm
he drops the match
he lights another one
falling onto the paper in the fireplace
it flickers for a moment then catches
birds are still pouring out past the paper beginning to catch
as a bird crashes through it
rushing to lydia swinging the cloth at her head
she is hysterics now babbling
the shriek of the birds is a wild cacophony
swooping out of the fireplace its wings aflame
less birds in the air now the single flaming bird flying toward the drapes
as the flaming bird lands on them
swinging the broom wildly
turning seeing his eyes opening wide
ripping at the flaming curtain
he throws it to the floor begins stamping on it
the fires working
only the blazing fire
no more birds entering
birds bursting through the panes leaving
as she beats away another bird
the birds leaving en masse now
windows broken furniture knocked over pictures askew the floor covered with birds and broken glass
in a corner of the room lydia crouches with her hands covering her face sobbing
the burnt curtain is still smoldering
mitch is covered with soot
melanie puts down the broom wearily
the attack is over
reaching down to pick up a dead bird
a plain man with a limited intelligence used to giving out speeding tickets or warning drunks
he holds the bird on the palm of his hand looks at it steadily nodding all the while
thats a chimney swift all right
we know what it is al
lydia is huddled in one of the easy chairs still in shock
well these birds live in chimneys you know
not by the thousands
no i gotta admit this is peculiar
pause did you have a light burning or something
yes but the curtains were drawn
cause sometimes birds are attracted by light you know
pause sure is a peculiar thing
what are we going to do about it al
i dont think i get you mitch
do about what
he feels a little foolish well
these birds attacked us
slight disbelief on his face
whats more likely they got in the room and was just panicked thats all
still a little hesitant all right ill grant you a birdll panic in an enclosed room
but they didnt just get in
they came in
right down that chimney
trying to make sense of this my wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once
shrugs didnt know how he got in there
had a broken leg turned out
just fluttering all around there
he shrugs again these birds were
what im trying to say mitch is these things happen sometimes you know
aint much we can do about it
he shrugs tell him about the party
we had a party here this afternoon for cathy
oh yeah yeah
he grins how old is she now
in the middle of the party some gulls came down at the children
and miss daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after
thinking were the kids bothering them or something
cause sometimes theyll do that you know
if you make any kind of disturbance near them theyll just come after you
i seen that plenty of times myself
the children were playing a game al
those gulls attacked without
now lydia attack is a pretty strong word dont you think
i mean birds just dont go around attacking people without no reason you know what i mean
the kids just probably scared them thats all
these birds attacked
nodding well what would you like me to do lydia
put out a pick up and hold on any suspicious birds in the area
he smiles now thatd be pretty silly wouldnt it
does this room look silly
no you got quite a mess here ill admit that
pause maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney pause seems a little pointless though
freak accident like this wouldnt happen again in a million years
pause you want some help cleaning up
i can handle it myself
giving a small moan
ill take cathy up to bed
are you staying
i think i should dont you
observing making no comment
putting her arm around cathys shoulders
ill get my things from the car
do you want to walk with me cathy
as cathy and melanie go out
well if theres anything else i can do mitch
well be all right
sure is peculiar i got to say that for it
it is silent
mitch looks across at lydia who sits as still as a stone in her chair
the door closes gently on a note of utter helplessness
melanie has just gotten out of bed
she is wearing the rather unsophisticated nightdress she brought at the store
her hair is loose
she wears no makeup
she is bent over a lavatory which has been installed in the bedroom
she is busily brushing her teeth
her head half turns as she hears mitch
mitch im going to drop cathy off now
ill probably drive over to the fawcett farm
do you need anything in town
melanie finished brushing her teeth
she goes to the window and looks out
outside we hear the sound of the pickup truck starting
as cathy carrying her schoolbooks runs to the pickup truck and climbs in
the truck moves out of the yard and down the road
it turns the bend and moves out of sight
turning from the window
she goes to the bedroom door camera following
she opens the door
there is no answer
coming down the steps from the attic room
the house is empty
the camera follows her into the dining room where she stops at the cage of lovebirds bends down to them with a smile on her face
she smiles and pokes her finger into the cage
the birds tweet at her
imitating them chee chee chee chee chee
leaving the cage
she walks to the sideboard upon which is an electric coffee percolator which is plugged into the wall
she feels it with her hand
it is hot
she pours a cup then peers out of the side window
mitch on the shore working with a rake in his hands
a thin column of smoke is climbing the sky
carrying the cup of coffee
she sets it down for a moment to put on her fur coat which is hanging on the hall stand
she picks up the cup again walks to the front door and exits
coming out of the house and into the garden carrying the cup of coffee
it is a beautiful day
she sips at her coffee and then breathes deeply of the air
there is a contentment in her which we have not seen before
she looks off toward the shore
on the shore working with the rake
the thin column of smoke is climbing the sky
she turns her attention away from mitch and walks to the end of the garden toward the shore
a wind is blowing off the water moving white puffs of cloud swiftly across the sky whipping the full short shirt of muumuu about her legs as she walks
she stands there silhouetted against the sky for a moment
as melanie scans the horizon
there isnt a bird anywhere in sight
the day is still and clear but somehow ominous in its silence
her gaze comes to rest on mitch and the thin column of smoke again
in the distance mitch sees her and raises his arm in greeting
she waves back at him
he puts the rake down and begins walking toward the house
there is anticipation on her face now
she watches mitch coming toward her her eyes glowing
closer to the house now
he stops looks at her and then turns toward the house
as first surprised and then puzzled
the back screen door clatters shut off screen
a small hurt look crosses her face
as she turns away from the house and begins walking in the garden sipping idly at her coffee
a screen door clatters again
mitch is coming out of the house from the front door wearing a different shirt buttoning it as he walks to her
i wanted to change my shirt
melanie is uncomprehending
it smelled of the fire
nodding its hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday isnt it
its so beautiful and still now
pause then sagely i think ive got it all figured out by the way
tell me about it
secretively its an uprising
certainly of birds
it all started several months ago with a peasant sparrow up in the hills a malcontent
he went around telling all the other sparrows that human beings werent fit to rule this planet preaching wherever anyone would listen
growing a beard
delighted yes of course he had to have a beard
birds of the world unite
he kept saying over and over
so they united
not at first
oh yes a few sparrows out for kicks
well theyll go along with anything
but eventually even the more serious minded birds began to listen
why should humans rule
they asked themselves
why should we submit ourselves to their domination
and all the while that sparrow was getting in his little messages
birds of the world unite
you have nothing to lose but your feathers
they both burst out laughing then fall into silence then laugh again and finally are silent
the garden is deathly still
attempting to be serious what it was probably
theyre probably hungry thats all
this was a bad summer
they eat berries and
and nuts you know and the hills are all burned out so theyre probably searching for food wherever they can get it
with my little sparrow leading team
she laughs and mitch joins her but it is hollow this time
like children who have told themselves a too realistic horror story they are becoming a little frightened
its so damn quiet out there
it was like that yesterday
what do you mean
after the gulls attacked
i hadnt thought of that
pause and then the swifts came
it makes you feel as if theyre
theyre waiting or
trying to make it light again no theyre having a meeting melanie
your sparrow is standing on a soap box and
her face dead serious
waving his little wings
his voice trails
his face becomes serious too
again the garden is silent
her face set and grim her eyes serious her words coming slowly and with the chill of horror on them
they were angry mitch
they came out of the chimney in fury
pause i had the feeling they wanted each and every one of us dead
he takes her in his arms suddenly to comfort her
she goes to him longingly
im frightened mitch
im frightened and confused and i
i think i want to go back to san francisco where there are buildings and
and concrete and
everything i know
she looks up at him suddenly
oh damn it why did you have to walk into that shop
they kiss suddenly and fiercely
on their kiss lydia at the wheel pulling into the fawcett farm the name of the farm clearly visible on a painted arch over the gate
lydia gets out of the truck and walks to the front door
there is no answer
she comes down off the steps the camera following back a little away from the house
there is no answer
she shades her eyes and looks out over the fields
as lydia crosses to a fence and cups her hands to her mouth
shouting hi there
he stops the tractor turns toward lydia shading his eyes
shouting is mr
shouting back i think so mam
his missus is in santa cruz but he ought to be here
have you seen him this morning
i reckon hes in there though
shouting it thank you
as she crosses the barnyard again
there are several chickens scurrying about
she walks closer to them sees an open bag of feed lying against the fence
getting an idea
reaching into the bag of feed
she scatters some on the ground
here chick chick chick chick
here chick chick chick chick
he struts up to the scattered grain
he seems to be examining the feed
then he turns away from it and struts off
a small knowledgeable nod of her head
the chickens reaction strengthens her determination to talk to fawcett
approaching the front door again
she backs away from the house again
the barnyard is silent
in the distance we can hear the sound of the tractor
are you home
a little annoyed
she glances at the ground floor window closest to the door
a small pane of glass is broken
going to the front door trying the knob
the door opening ahead of her as she pokes her head into the house
the house is still and silent
as lydia comes in
we can see the living room off to the right but it looks normal and untouched
lydia turns to her left and looks down a long corridor
a door at the end of it is partially ajar spilling artificial light into the corridor
a little troubled
she seems deciding whether or not she should leave
a determined look comes over her face
as she walks down it slowly toward the open door at the opposite end
outside the door she pauses
are you in there
lydia puts out her hand slowly begins showing the door open
coming into the room
her eyes begin to take in the room
starting to the right of the doorway as she enters and continuing a little below eye level the camera picks out a standing floor lamp the shade dangling but the
light still burning a picture hanging askew on the wall its glass shattered the window to the left of the picture every pane of glass shattered a dresser with two stuffed birds on its top both birds have been badly damaged the stuffing ripped out of them the head of one hanging at a crooked near decapitated angle the window to the left of the dresser all the panes shattered
the level of the camera descends and begins a slow pan of the floor
it picks out broken glass continues its pan to show scattered feathers continues its pan to show a broom feathers caught in the straw a single bedroom slipper continues to
show a pair of legs in pajamas one foot bare the other slippered and then immediately his face
covered with blood the eyes missing from their empty staring sockets
immediately a terrified scream erupting from her mouth
turning and running for the door
the camera follows her in an unbroken headlong flight the scream continuing as if she is incapable of stopping it as she stumbles runs trips her way down the corridor
and bursts out of the house still screaming into the pickup truck
the engine starts she backs the truck out at breakneck speed and hits the highway at the wheel her face stamped with terror her eyes wide
at breakneck speed negotiating the severe curves on the highway
it almost hits a small car coming from the opposite direction swerves screeches around the curve
behind the wheel unmindful of anything but flight
through the windshield blurring past
she turns the bend leading to the house
for an instant through the windshield there is a quick glimpse of melanie and mitch in embrace in the garden
then the tires shriek and the truck turns and barrels into the front yard
alarmed as he runs out of the garden and toward the truck just as it jerks to a stop
through the truck as he pulls open the door opposite lydia
alarmed what is it
as he sees his mother
slumped on the wheel of the car her head on her arms sobbing
on her sobs
at the kitchen stove taking a kettle of tea from the burner
she pours it into a cup puts the cup on a tray already set with sugar and creamer
she looks up as mitch comes into the kitchen
that was al on the phone
he wants me to meet him out at the fawcett place
says some detectives from santa rosall be there in a little while
pause will you be all right here
i was just taking her in some tea
he goes to her puts his arms around her from behind kisses her hair
but she turns in his arms suddenly and clings to him fiercely and then buries her head in his shoulder
she walks him to the door
at the door they kiss a long full kiss
as mitch goes out
melanie looks after him for a moment and then picks up the tray
outside we hear the sound of his car starting
the camera follows melanie out of the kitchen through the dining room and to one of the bedroom doors on the other side of the house
gently she knocks
this is lydias room and cluttered with the mementos of a life no longer valid
there are photographs of her dead husband souvenirs of trips taken together bric a brac of mitchs childhood
under it all there is a distinct femininity
she sits up in bed as melanie enters bearing the tray
no its me mrs
i thought you might like some tea
oh thank you
there is a long silence as melanie puts the tray on the bed arranges the pillows behind lydia
al malone wanted him out at the fawcett farm
didnt al believe my story
he was calling from the farm mrs
then he saw
he must have
he sent for the santa rosa police
what good will they do
she sips at the tea
there is a long awkward pause
melanie walks to the window and looks out over the bay
do you think cathys all right
at the school
at the window her face turned away from lydia
her expression clearly shows that she doesnt know whether cathy is all right
but when she turns to lydia there is a comforting smile on her face and her voice is soothing
yes im sure shes fine
do i sound foolish to you
i keep seeing dan fawcetts face
she shudders they have such big windows at the school
pause all the windows were broken
in dans bedroom
all the windows
try not to think of that mrs
i wish i were a stronger person
there is a long awkward silence
she sips at her tea reflectively
i lost my husband four years ago you know
pause its odd how you depend on someone for strength and then suddenly all the strength is gone and youre alone
pause id love to relax some time
id love to be able to sleep
pause the worried look again do you think cathys all right
shell be all right
im not this way you know
i dont fuss and fret over my children
pause when frank died
pause you see he knew the children he really knew them
he had the knack of being able to enter into their world of becoming a part of them
thats a rare talent
i wish i could be that way
there is another silence
a curious thing is happening in this room
lydia for perhaps the first time since her husbands death is discussing it with another person
curiously the person is melanie
honestly and simply i miss him
pause you know sometimes i wake up in the morning and i think i have to make franks breakfast and i
i get up and theres a
a very good reason for getting out of bed until
until of course i remember
pause i miss talking to him
pause cathys a child you know and mitch
she shrugs a little sadly mitch has his own life
pause im glad he stayed here today
i feel safer with him here
she sighs deeply would you like to rest now mrs
dont go yet
pause i feel as if i
i dont understand you
and i want so much to understand
because my son is
pause my son seems to be fond of you
pause and i
pause im not quite sure how i feel about it
i really dont know if i
like you or not
is that so important mrs
you liking me
yes i think so
my son is important to me
i want to like any girl he chooses
and if you dont
with a faint smile then i dont suppose itll matter much to anyone but me
i think it might also matter to mitch
shaking her head mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do
pause im not complaining
thats the mark of a man
pause you see i
i wouldnt want to be
be left alone
i dont think i could bear being left alone
this business with the birds has me upset
i dont know what id do if mitch werent here
going to the bed adjusting the pillow why dont you try to sleep now mrs
sighing i wish i were stronger
she pauses and looks toward the window
do you think shes all right
do you think shes safe at the school
would you like me to go for her
i couldnt ask you to
i dont mind really
id feel so much better
ill just clear up here and then dress
she picks up the tray and starts for the door
at the door melanie turns
her face soft
gently thank you for the tea
melanies car turns and goes up school road
closer shot of the car coming to a stop outside school
inside the school we hear the children singing
i married my wife in the month of june

smiling as she gets out of the car and heads for the school
i carried her off in a silver spoon
ristle tee rostle tee hey bombosity knickety knackety retro retroquo quality willoby wallaby quo mo mo mo

the childrens voices are louder now
she combed her hair but once a year
ristle tee rostle tee mo mo mo
with every rake she shed a tear
ristle tee rostle tee hey bombosity knickety knackety retro quo quality willoby wallaby mo mo mo
melanie is at the door to annies room now
she opens the door and looks in
leading the children in song
she catches sight of melanie at the door
melanie wiggles her fingers
annie points to her wristwatch indicating that shell be finished in a few minutes and motions for her to wait in the play yard outside
melanie turns and starts down the corridor again
melanie emerges and strolls up street toward annies house
inside the children are still singing
she swept the floor but once a year
ristle tee rostle tee mo mo mo
she swore her broom was much too dear
ristle tee rostle tee hey bombosity knickety knackety retro quo quality willoby wallaby mo mo mo

a nearer cut of melanie same angle as previous
again four more crows arrive
nearer shot of melanie smoking
just above waist bust shot
again five more crows arrive
head and shoulders of melanie as she sits smoking
there is no sound except for the faint voices of the children singing inside the schoolhouse
melanie is puffing away at her cigarette and occasionally glances in the direction of the school
we hold on this shot of melanie for a very long time so that we are able to express her ignorance of what is going on behind her with the
after a wait of about what seems to be a half a minute or more melanies attention is drawn to something above her
a crows is coming down
as her eyes follow the flight of the crow
crow moving down and left to right the sky and annies roof in the background
her head has twisted around to follow the flight of the crow
she is almost looking into the play yard
a crow slowly descends to the play yard and as the camera follows it down we see for the first time that the number of crows has increased to an
alarming number almost or even perhaps
this last crow settles down with the others
throughout preceding i asked my wife to wash the floor
ristle tee rostle tee mo mo mo
she gave me my hat and showed me the door

close shot melanie the camera whips up as she leaps to her feet in alarm
her body has turned but we are now facing the opposite side of the school yard
the play yard is full of crows
big head of horrified melanie
a closer view of the menacing birds
big profile of melanie
she turns with back to camera and goes toward school looking at crows as she goes away
the camera follows her for a few paces and then stops so that her image becomes smaller as she goes up steps into a side view of the crows as
seen by melanie
melanie in headlong flight toward annies room
all right children
now please put your books in your desks and bring the songsheets to the front of the room
no ones going out to play until i have all the songsheets
annie is lining the children up near the door leading to the play yard
were not going outside until we quiet down
did you hear me
the children mutter for a moment and then are still
all right now
she begins opening the play yard door
suddenly the door from the corridor bursts open and melanie rushes wildly into the room
she goes directly to annie shoves her out of the way and slams shut the play yard door
against a background of childrens voices as they react to this new excitement
weve got to get the children out of here
these big windows
theres no way to board them up
annie gives a quick nod understanding immediately
through the windows we can see the waiting crows
one moves restlessly into flight then settles on the equipment again
quiet down children
the children modulate into silence
miss daniels wants to see how we conduct ourselves during a fire drill
id like you to
grumbling in unison a fire drill
this is our play period miss hayworth
id like you to show her how quiet and obedient you can be
the children again fall silent
were going to go out of the school now
those of you who live nearby can go directly home
i want the rest of you to go down the hill all the way to the hotel
do you understand
all the way down the hill
gee miss hayworth we never
why do we
shushing them i want you to go as quietly as you can not a sound until i tell you to run
and then i want you to run as fast as you can
does everyone understand
pause silence all right
john would you lead the class please
the children walk two by two to the corridor door
john opens it and they begin filing out
melanie turns to look at the play yard
fluttering at the window almost in exploration
he hangs there for a moment then wings back to the playground equipment
straight on of all the crows
but a different angle
but a different angle from the others a low angle of five or six crows filling the screen
the screen is filled with crows
about fifty or more
all of a sudden we hear the distant pattering of childrens feet as they start running
immediately the crows rise and the camera pans up with them into the sky
the full shot showing the children running toward the camera annie herding them at the rear
the crows about two hundred rising over the schoolhouse roof and descending toward and reaching the running children
shot as a moving background with six or seven children in front on a treadmill with the mechanical birds coming into top of screen as though continuing on from the
the birds swing around and among the foreground children

big head of bird coming into camera
straight back close shot of annie dragging slow children
no birds in back but several wheeling around them
showing the crows chasing the children down the street with the bay in the distance
a bird dives to head of michele and she falls out of picture
of michele as she hits ground
her glasses smash
flash cathy she sees and runs back
birds swirling around
six birds descend on fallen michele legs running by
cathy rushes in
she disperses birds and bends to pick up michele
melanie stops looks back and sees cathy and michele heads of other children rushing by in foreground
melanie dashes out left
melanie reaches cathy and michele michele is now on her feet
birds swirling melanie looks about sees
station wagon across the street
birds swirling about and children running by
melanie drags cathy and michele to the station wagon
we see the bay in the distance and children running on the bottom of the street
shooting inside the wagon across the front seat
the three scramble in cathy first then michele and melanie last the door slams on crows swooping around
cathy and michele are screaming with fright
through the windshield we see crows attacking
bay and running children in distance
the faces of the three birds are fluttering on the rear window
wheel in foreground
she starts to slam hand on horn ring
crows attacking side window
hand on horn ring
cathy and micheles faces huddled together
melanies big head she looks down
knob of wiper her hand comes in and pulls it out
the three faces staring out
the crows are starting to go away
melanie looks out and sees through windshield
annie running back with stick
she beats the last of the crows away
melanie flops in exhaustion over the wheel as annie comes round to the side window and starts to open the door
it is lunchtime and there is a busy bustle to the place as deke carter officiates behind the bar and helen carter his wife rushes back and forth between diners
at the tables
a drunk sits at the bar old grizzled the weary wisdom of booze in him
in one of the booths sits sebastian sholes in his shirt sleeves eating a hurried lunch quickly and efficiently
a woman and two children are seated at another table about to order
a party of noisy salesman is laughing and clowning around throughout following at a table in the rear
the phone from behind the bar has been placed on the counter and melanie is speaking into it while deke listens
over her head the television set is blasting with its perennial western the gun shots punctuating her conversation
daddy there were hundreds of them
no im not hysterical im trying to tell you this as calmly as i know how
all right daddy
she takes a deep breath just now
fifteen minutes ago
the door to the tides opens and mrs
bundy sixtyish wearing walking shoes and a tweed suit a very masculine looking woman with short clipped white hair comes in passes through foreground goes to bar her attention slowly
caught by what melanie is saying
at the school
no i dont
just a minute
to deke whats the name of the school
just the bodega bay school
bundy help you mrs
i need some change mr
as deke opens cash register
the bodega bay school
to deke could you turn that down please
deke gives mrs
bundy her change turns off television
i dont know how many children
thirty or forty
bundy goes to cigarette machine pauses to listen to melanie
no the birds didnt attack until the children were outside the school
crows i think
i dont know daddy
is there a difference between crows and blackbirds
turning from machine there is very definitely a difference miss
theyre different daddy
bundy thank you
into phone i think these were crows
yes hundreds of them
yes they attacked the children attacked them
exasperated daddy a little girl was sent to the hospital in santa rosa
well all right but you act as if im
all right all right
pause no i cant come home now
i just cant daddy
how is it there
are there birds
in the sky
but no trouble
well i hope
pause i dont know when
i simply cant leave now
tell mother not to worry
all right daddy good by
she hangs up
bundy is at her elbow
theyre both perching birds of course but of quite different species
the crow is brachyrhynchos
the blackbird is cyanocephalus
to deke do you know dan fawcetts number
in the book right here miss
as melanie looks it up
bundy i dont see what difference it makes mrs
bundy crows or blackbirds
if they attacked the school thats pretty serious
with a superior smile i hardly think either species would have the intelligence to launch a massed attack
their brain pans arent large enough for such
dialing i just came from the school madam
i dont know about their brain pans but
birds are not aggressive creatures miss
they bring beauty to the world
it is mankind rather who
going to door leading to kitchen three southern fried chicken sam
baked potato on all of them
laughter from salesman at table
into phone hello may i speak to mitch brenner please
pause yes ill wait
continuing to deke insist on making it difficult for life to survive on this planet
if it werent for birds
bundy you dont seem to understand
this young lady says there was an attack on the school
in background mitch
im glad i caught you
something terrible has happened
her background conversation continues through following suddenly its the end of the world
whats this about the school
bunch of crows attacked the school helen
its the end of the world
suddenly quoting thus saith the lord god to the mountains and to the hills to the rivers and to the valleys behold i even i will bring a sword upon
you and i will destroy your high places
the lords not destroying anything jason
in all your dwelling places the cities shall be laid waste and the high places shall be laid waste
he nods ezekiel chapter six
quoting woe unto them that rise up early in the morning that they may follow strong drink
nodding isaiah chapter
its the end of the world
yes all right ill wait for you
she hangs up laughing i hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world
turning to her these werent a few birds
waiting for their lunch listening to the conversation becoming very nervous
i didnt even know there were many crows in bodega bay this time of year
the crow is a permanent resident throughout its range
in fact during our christmas count we recorded
suddenly from his table how many gulls did you count mrs
which gulls mr
there are several varieties
the ones thatve been raising the devil with my fishing boats
probably herring gulls
they arrive in november you know and dont migrate north again until march or
leaping upon this have you had trouble with gulls
one of my boats did last week
making a connection this young lady got hit by a gull only saturday
from kitchen pick up the chicken
now its gulls
a minute ago it was crows
she picks up tray shrugs goes to table deke im still waiting for those bloody marys
coming right up
as helen brings food
she is beginning to get really frightened
could you ask them to lower their voices please
theyre frightening the children
timmy has a canary
are you timmy
my cousin is timmy
leaving table coming to bar a whole flock of gulls nearby capsized one of my boats
practically tore of the skippers arm
coming back youre scaring the kids
keep it low
youre scaring me too
are you trying to say all these
he shakes his head that sounds impossible sebastian
im only telling you what happened to my boat
the gulls were after your fish mr
really lets be logical about this
what were the crows after at the school
what do you think they were after miss
i think they were after the children
for what purpose
she hesitates to kill them
there is a long silence
i dont know why
i thought not
birds have been on this planet since archaeopteryx miss daniels a hundred and twenty million years ago
a traveling salesman enters goes to bar listens
doesnt it seem odd that theyd wait all that time to start a
a war against humanity
no one called it a war
scotch light on the water
you and mr
sholes seem to be implying as much
are you finished here sebastian
let me have some apple pie helen
bundy who said anything about war
all i said was that some gulls
yelling to kitchen one apple pie
you want more coffee
came down on one of my boats
they could have been after the fish just as you said
your captain should have shot at them
gulls are scavengers anyway
most birds are
if you ask me we should wipe them all out
world would be better off without them
all they do is make a mess of everything
who needs them
we need them
not if theyre starting a war
they are incapable of organized warfare
have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest
i have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do
ornithology happens to be my avocation miss daniels
youre talking about preservation of the species a hen protecting her young
theres a vast difference between
maybe theyre all protecting the species
maybe theyre tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and
are you discussing gamebirds now
all birds are not gamebirds you know
i dont know anything about birds except that theyre attacking this town
then fight back
get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the earth
that would hardly be possible
why not mrs
because there are species of birds in the world today mr
its estimated that five billion seven hundred and fifty million birds live in the united states alone
the five continents of the world
muttering kill them all
get rid of them
probably contain more than a hundred billion birds
its the end of the world
well we seem to have more than our share of them right now mrs
maybe this young ladys right
maybe theyve all gone crazy
heres your pie sebastian
you want it at the table
he begins eating where are the bloody marys deke
angrily are we running a business here or a bird sanctuary
beginning to change his mind actually those gulls must have been after the fish
makes a lot more sense than
well an attack
of course it does
if we believe that birds are attacking why
why next well believe that grasshoppers and cockroaches are capable of
getting more and more anxious
finish your lunch
are the birds gonna eat us mommy
maybe were all getting a little carried away by this
admittedly a few birds acted strangely
thats no reason to believe
this isnt a few birds
i keep telling you that
these are gulls and swifts and crows and
is it impossible
i have never known birds of different species to flock together
the very concept is unimaginable
laughing why if that happened we wouldnt have a chance
how could we possible hope to fight them
youre right mrs
calling from table excuse me may i have a check please
concerned is everything all right maam
im anxious to get on the road
coming from kitchen whats the matter
something wrong out here
all this shouting

something like this happened in santa cruz last year
the town was covered with seagulls
cant you please finish your drink
thats right sir i recall it
a large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog and headed in for the town where all the lights were
they made some mess too smashing into houses and everything
shaking his head they always make a mess
were better off without them
the point is that no one seemed to get upset about it
they were gone the next morning just as if nothing at all had happened
are you coming
all right all right
he downs his drink hope you figure this out folks
its the end of the world
the tides is silent for a moment
well id better get back to the cannery
what do i owe you deke
scallops and coffee
hold it just a minute sebastian
sholes turns to him
his face very serious
sebastian im not an alarmist
no one ever said you were mitch

i dont know how or why this started but i know its here and i know wed be crazy to ignore it
sarcastically ignore what
the bird war

count on that
bundy why dont you go home and polish your binoculars

thoughtfully i like bodega bay as well as any man

im not sure but
if you dont even know what you want to do

taking position beside melanie you listen to him sebastian
i only know weve got to drive them away from town before they drive us away
bundy you said something about santa cruz
about seagulls getting lost in the fog and heading in for the lights
we dont have any fog this time of year mitch
well make our own fog
how do you plan to do that
theres an ordinance against burning anything in this town unless its
well use smoke pots
like the army uses
what goodll that do
smokes as bad as birds
birds are not bad
how can we go on living here if we blanket the town with smoke
can we go on living here otherwise
they are silent
slowly its worth a try sebastian
there is more silence as they all consider
and then suddenly look
they turn toward the window
viewed from the side window inside the tides we see three or four gulls diving down toward the highway over the roof of the tides office
two more swoop into the foreground of the window and out to the left
theyre only the usual
what are you
the first gull reaches the gas station but misses the attendant who is in the act of filling the car
the owner is seen disappearing into the mens room
a quick flash of the group of faces at the window of the tides restaurant
a nearer view of the gas station
a second gull hits the man on the back he falls hits his head on the pump and then collapses over the gasoline hose pipe pulling it out and causing
it to spill
the third and fourth gulls sweep by
the gas begins to flow away
inside the tides
mitch dashes toward the door melanie after him
through the glass windows into the street we see people dashing off to the right in the direction of the gas station
at the door mitch turns
to melanie stay back in here
deke carter comes running from behind the bar to join mitch
they both exit
melanie dashes back to her original place at the window
the camera retreating with her we come to the window and over melanies shoulder we see the men arrive to rescue the attacked gas station attendant
three or four gulls are still attacking and they flutter away as the men appear to beat them off
suddenly melanie in the foreground turns in full profile to her right and looks down
on the sloping pavement before her a stream of gasoline is flowing to the right into the car park
flowing down to the car park
through the window
she suddenly looks toward the gas station
along the flowing gas back to the station
she turns back to the car park
we see the flow of gasoline trickling toward the car parked below her
at this particular moment a car has pulled up has come to a stop and a man emerges
he is in the act of lighting his dead cigar but his attention is drawn to the happenings around the gas station
with this half drawn attention he strikes the match and holds it to the cigar
she quickly slides the window open and yells down to the man
the man looks about him holding the match i his fingers
as he catches sight of melanie the match burns his finger and he drops it
her horror stricken face
three fast explosions in a row as the mans car mitchs car and the one next to it go up in flames
the line of flame running swiftly from the burning cars following the gasoline on the ground directly to the pump which blows up as the men are jumping away with
the injured attendant
a very high shot shows the beginning of the people of the town rushing around the car park and the streets across the highway endeavoring to put out the two
we see automobiles coming to a stop on highway one and the oil smoke beginning to rise from the burning gas station and the parked cars
some men have managed to start a fire hose and have trained it on the burning cars
suddenly but slowly the foreground in the sky just below the camera begins to fill with wheeling gulls
the whole picture below becomes obliterated by the foreground birds who now begin to swoop down on the town
a raking shot outside the tides restaurant showing the phone booth and motel off in the background
people are rushing out from the restaurant and look up in the sky
gulls begin to descend into the scene driving the people back into the restaurant
melanie is seen in the distance calling for mitch mitch
we see her look up to the sky
the sky is full of seagulls
looking about her frantically
she turns her face up again to see the descending gulls
she is driven to take refuge in the phone booth
slams the door shut
gulls are now beating at the glass all around her
from melanies viewpoint inside the booth we see the people who have been rushing to put out the fire now faced with clouds of birds coming on them
looking out in terrified alarm but still searching with her eyes for mitch
in the phone booth
she turns and looks swiftly in the direction of the car park
some men have secured a hose and are obviously getting water from the bay
they are turning the stream onto the burning cars
at this time the birds are filling the area around them
they suddenly turn the hose up into the birds
her eyes turn up quickly
we see the stream of water swing to and from among the birds
melanie turns back from this at the sound of a roaring car
we see a car zig zag down from the town in a drunken manner coming toward her in the phone booth
we can see birds flying in and out of the windows of the car
we can see the arm and hand of the driver trying to beat them away
in the background of this scene we see the fire truck arrive
as the car comes toward her in the booth
at the last minute the car swerves away from the booth
a side view of the car after practically scraping the side of the booth
we see that its full of birds attacking the driver
as it goes by it near tilts over to inadvertently give us a view of its interior
watching the car
the car goes on and smashes into the other burning cars
suddenly she hears the firing of a gun
she sees a man with a gun shooting up at birds but to no avail
one or two descend upon him
he throws the gun down and rushes back into the tides office
melanie with a slight turn now sees the fire volunteers with birds descending around them drop their hose
shows the hose snaking wildly and jumping
at one moment the water turns and comes in a powerful stream hitting the windows of the phone booth
recoils from this water attack
through the streaming window she sees the fire volunteers rushing away for cover
to the left we see a horse with its head covered with gulls its palomino colored body covered with crows
it is bucking and leaping and kicking its van to pieces
at this moment the scene is obliterated by the appearance of a man groping his way closely past the phone booth windows
his face is poring with blood his head and shoulders are covered with attacking birds
he disappears from sight
melanie now almost in a faint opens her eyes to see tides town
through the booth window she sees mitch and deke carter the owner of the tides coming down toward the camera and waving the birds away from them with flailing arms
opens the booth doors and starts out with a cry of recognition but she has barely stepped out when more gulls crash around the booth causing her to go back
looking out again toward mitch
through window she sees deke carter run off in one direction while mitch suddenly sees a child at the window of the burning building adjacent to the flaming and smoking
mitch dashes across and goes up the short staircase into the smoking building
looking across in horror
for a moment there is no sign of anyone about then suddenly mitch appears with the small child at the window
he calls down
one man dashes from the direction of the tides office another from the tides restaurant
they both wait below the window as mitch drops the child
watching this breathlessly
the moment the child has dropped mitch suddenly looks up
he slams the window as two or three birds crash into the windows
they disappear into the building
holding her breath
no sign of mitch
getting more desperate
no sign of mitch
suddenly a chair flies through the window and mitch climbs out and drops to the ground
opening the door of the booth yells out to him
sees her and starts running toward the booth
beating his way through the birds
he reaches the booth
close to the tides restaurant entrance
we see mitch drag melanie from the phone booth and run with her toward the camera through the birds into the restaurant
there must be at least twenty people all looking toward the windows
it is as though they are hiding from a storm
the camera is high enough to see melanie and mitch come in very hurriedly close the door
we see the gulls wheeling outside
there is a kind of stunned silence among the people
we can hear the sound of the screaming gulls outside
suddenly a womans voice screams out why are they doing it
why are they doing it
some of the heads of the group turn
it is the woman who had the two children screaming at mrs
bundy who is seated in a booth table staring numb and helpless
bundy turns and looks at her and mutters some words
bundy offers a weak explanation of why the birds could have gone berserk like this
this information should be obtained from dr
looking across at this slight scene
they turn back and over their shoulders the gulls seem to be in much less quantity
looking up i think theyre going
melanie follows his look
at this moment there is a loud crash of glass
they turn their heads suddenly
and past the heads of the other people who have also turned we see one of the back windows of the tides restaurant has gone and gulls are coming in
two or three of the men who are on the edge of the crowd turn and go back toward the window beating them out
they succeed in doing this
they turn from the gulls in the restaurant to look to the street
i think its safe to get out now
dont lets take any chances
weve got to get cathy
they open the door and make their way out into the street running and looking about them desperately
there are one or two gulls flying around
others are perched on roofs as we see mitch and melanie dashing along the sidewalk
there are still one or two gulls or crows in evidence as they move along past the last street and come into the more countrified part of the town
we see them turn and dash up the road toward the school which we see in the distance
there are some birds perched on the school roof
going up the school road
he stops for a moment and looks up melanie following his look
of wheeling gulls
they move on and go past melanies waiting car outside the school
suddenly melanie brings him to a halt
there are a few blackbirds on it
the crows again
mitch starts off
melanie restrains him
the crows may be back in the play yard
they advance cautiously
when they are level with the play yard we see what they see
the camera dollies along the play yard
it is again full of crows
they walk stealthily past
camera panning along the waiting crows
shooting over the shoulders of melanie and mitch they approach annies house
melanie glances apprehensively over her shoulder toward the crows
melanie and mitch arrive
they come to a sudden stop
a woman is crumpled lifelessly on the front steps before the door
he reaches the body
he rolls it over
the shock registering on his face
realizing that annie is dead and wondering for a moment what mitchs reaction will be
he kneels silently by the body
gently he touches annies face and then gently and illogically takes off his jacket and covers her as if he is tucking a blanket around her to keep her warm
he turns away then
with its room to let sign
cathy is standing near the sign with her eyes peering at something outside
turning to follow cathys gaze
malevolent sitting on the fence the killers
as in fury mitch picks up stones and begins hurling them at the birds
melanie dashes forward
as the birds flutter into the air mitch
she runs to him grabs his arm struggles with him as he maniacally continues hurling stones at the birds who are now hovering flight
lets get out of here
her words reach him
breathing heavily he goes into the house and comes out carrying cathy who is dazed and in a state of shock
the camera pans him over to melanie who holds cathy to her
as melanie looks anxiously toward the house
mitch you cant leave her out there
he goes out of picture
melanie watches him
over her shoulder is the white face of cathy
we hear a dragging sound and then a door is closed
we see mitch emerging from the house
the body is no longer in the pathway
he comes toward the camera
he joins melanie and cathy
the camera moves ahead of the three of them as they silently make their way past the crows once more melanie holding cathy close to her
they look out cautiously to the right
camera dollying past the crows again
they move forward stealthily camera ahead of them
another dolly shot past the crows
the camera is now behind them
they move away from us and go toward the waiting car
they arrive at the car
you drive mitch
she goes round the far side and gets into the car
mitch slips in behind the drivers seat
the car turns into the camera and goes down the school road
mitch cathy and melanie facing the camera tensely
melanie looks over her shoulder
holding her breath i dont think theyre coming
cathy does not turn she is staring ahead of her her eyes wide her lip trembling
they drive in silence and then suddenly cathy begins speaking almost as if to herself as the camera comes in tight on her face in shock
on our way back from taking michele home
we heard the explosion and went outside to
what it was
pause all at once the
the birds were everywhere
all at once
she pushed me inside and
they covered her
pause she pushed me inside
as she takes the child in her arms to comfort her
close shot a lone gull flying low over the water the camera tracking it
the bay is silent
the gull spreads its wings to brake and then sits on the water
the camera continues low over the water going through thousands of gulls sitting there patiently as if it is threading itself through a crowd not a sound over the gulls
and then lifting to show the brenner house in the distance
behind the panes of glass we can see the boards mitch nailed across the windows
he is on the roof now testing the two attic dormer windows
he turns to look out over the bay
covered with sitting gulls
in the distance the town is still smoldering
but the sky is clear of birds
picking up his hammer sliding over the shingles to where the ladder leans against the side of the house
as mitch comes down the ladder and melanie turns the corner carrying a load of driftwood and old lumber
as she drops the wood outside the door and he joins her
she is looking out over the bay when he comes to her
this is not the melanie we saw at the beginning of the picture
her hair is disarrayed and her face and clothing are streaked with soot
but beyond a surface physical appearance there is a weary wisdom in her eyes and a strength to her as she stands looking toward the distant smoldering town
the town looks clear
the bay doesnt
how long have they been gathering there
the past fifteen minutes
pause it seems to be a pattern doesnt it
they strike and disappear and then they start massing again
they are both silent watching the bay
i keep thinking of annie
she squeezes her eyes shut after a long pause it
it doesnt look very different does it
a little smoke over the town but otherwise
looking even the birds sitting out there
it does look very much the same mitch
this could be last week
it may not be last week again for a long long time
they are both silent
theyre still coming
do you want to try your father again
melanie shakes her head
puzzled mitch looks at her i tried a little while ago
the phones dead
have we still got power
leaning against him im tired mitch
im so very very tired
im getting something on the radio
lydia is hovering near the radio
cathy is sitting on a footstool
the windows are boarded and the lights in the room are on
a tremendous amount of static is coming from the radio as mitch and melanie join them i cant get any of the local stations
i think this is san francisco
would include formulation of a central financing committee to handle credit and to allocate responsibility for the various facets of the project
a vote on the motion is expected early tomorrow morning
continuing with the local news police are still investigating the series of valuable jade burglaries in the chinatown area
the round up of known criminals has not as yet produced a suspect but commissioner nelson said today he was certain the burglaries were quote linked and the work of
the team of professionals unquote
pause in bodega bay early this morning a large flock of crows attacked a group of children who were leaving the school during a fire drill
one little girl was seriously injured and taken to the hospital in santa rosa but the majority of children reached safety in the town
pause on the national scene today the opening of the new session of congress was marked by a state of the union address that
is that all
drew a standing ovation for the president
the chief executive in discussing our relation to europe and the rest of the world community said these various elements of our foreign policy lead as i have said to
a single goal sighing were going to need more wood for the fire
we cant let it go out
continuing as drone in background the goal of a peaceful world of free and independent states
this is our guide for the present and our vision for the future a free community of nations independent but interdependent uniting north and south east and west in one
great family of man outgrowing and transcending the hates and fears that rend our age
we will not reach that goal today or tomorrow
we may not reach it in our lifetime
but the quest is the great adventure of our century
we sometimes chafe at the burdens of our obligations the complexity of our decisions the agony of our choices but there is no comfort or security for us in evasion
no solution in abdication no relief in irresponsibility
pause in assuming the tasks of the presidency i said that few generations in all history had been granted the role of being the great defender of freedom in its
hour of maximum danger
this is our good fortune and i welcome it now as i did when i first took office
pause for it is the fate of this generation of you in the congress and of me as president to live with a struggle we did not start in a
world we did not make
but the pressures of life are not always distributed by choice
and while no nation has ever faced such a challenge no nation has ever been ready to seize the burden and the glory of
pause did you you get the windows in the attic mitch
i got them all mother
when do you think theyll come
i dont know
if there are
larger birds mitch
theyll get into the house
thats a chance we have to take
maybe we ought to leave
not while theyre massing out there
i dont know when
well see what
where will we go
i dont know yet
i think well be safe here
pause lets bring that wood in
what happens when we run out of wood
music begins to play
the music is sweet with violins and long piano arpeggios almost too much to bear against the tension being played in front of it
i dont know
well break up the furni
shouting you dont know you dont know
when will you know
when were all dead
shrieking it her face white mother
at mitch if your father were here
im trying my best
shaking his head im
trembling nodding im sorry mitch
the strain showing on his face
he nods briefly
lets get the wood
why dont you make us all some coffee mother
as melanie and mitch come out and head for the pile of wood
there is a noise in the sky
startled glancing upward they begin to run back toward the house and then stop and slowly scan the sky
flying in tight formation
where are they heading
watching the birds
a look of utter sadness crosses her face
it is clear that she is thinking the birds will reach santa rosa and eventually san francisco as well
gently come on
lets get this wood in
but the look of sadness stays on her face and her eyes remain on the sky
lydia is pouring coffee into cups
in the dining room we can hear the chatter of the lovebirds
as lydia pours the sound distracts her
cathy is sorting candles at the couch
there is evidence of preparation everywhere flashlights kerosene lamps a butane burner
mitch is at the fireplace putting more wood on the fire
melanie comes into the room and dumps another load
thats the last of it
did you close the door
and locked it
mitch can i bring the lovebirds in here
snapping it no
mom theyre in a cage
studying his mother realizing how close she is to breaking
softly let them stay in the other room
her hand trembling as she pours the coffee
as they all sit and accept their coffee
the room is silent except for the crackle of the fire
mitch rises to put more wood on the fire
in the dining room the lovebirds still are chattering wildly
their chirping is the only sound in the house
why are they doing this
putting wood on fire i dont know honey
why are they trying to kill people
i wish i could say
but if i could answer that i could also tell you why people are trying to kill people
the room is silent again except for the tweeting of the lovebirds offscreen
and then suddenly the lovebirds fall silent
turning to look toward the other room her face going white her eyes widening
dead silent now
each of them is sitting on the edges of their chairs waiting
there is the sudden sound of splintering glass
into the silence another pane of glass shattering the thud of a bird against the boards
more panes of glass shattering
the sound of birds striking the boards and the outside of the house begins building almost like muffled drumbeats
thud thud with an irregularity of rhythm
interspersed like the counterpoint in an alien orchestration is the flutter of wings
and then like another section entering we begin to hear the scratching and clawing at the roof
looking up toward the roof the sound getting louder
she squeezes her eyes shut
as the child cuddles up into her arms
over the other sounds there comes a new sound the unmistakable rat tat tat tattat of a woodpecker
it begins again
rat tat tat tattat tat
tat in terror im
im sick melanie
i want to throw
her face pale she rises suddenly and starts for the bathroom
ill go with you
they leave the room
mitch and lydia sit in silence
we hear cathy retching offscreen almost drowned out by the shuffling of wings and the rasping of claws the incessant thudding of birds striking the house
mitch rises and puts more wood on the fire
the sound of the birds is still everywhere around the house
he looks at his watch
he rises walks into the kitchen to check the back door
it seems all right
the camera follows him into the dining room
he stops at the cage with the lovebirds
is there menace or innocence in their eyes
he cannot tell
looking at the lovebirds in puzzlement
there is suddenly a new sound offscreen the splintering of wood the tearing sound of bigger beaks
alarmed he turns
coming into the entry hall
the wood is beginning to splinter as the bigger birds outside assail the door
turning quickly the camera following him into the dining room
he pulls the cloth off the table begins moving it toward the door
in the entry he lifts the table on end and piles it against the door
he goes into the kitchen again camera following
he upends the enamel topped table drags it to the back door
he is piling chairs against the table when melanie comes in
she looks at what he is doing with alarm
mitch looks in the direction of where his mother is and then back to melanie with an expression almost of desperation
both turn back to the barricaded door
the clawing and the pecking fills the void
the noise is a din now insidious and increasingly more frightening
when will they stop
i thought theyd have stopped by now
what time is it
almost two a
you must be exhausted
how about you
she shakes her head
they both move into the dining room the camera following them
the lovebirds are sitting in their cage close together silent
mitch picks up a chair ready to carry it to the front door
he hesitates puts down the chair goes to the cage
looking at the birds wondering
looking back at him
again it is impossible to read their expressions
malice or benevolence
he raises his hand brings it toward the bars of the cage
as he thrusts it through the bars
the birds sit unmoving
one of them tweets
i wonder if cathy fed them
he turns away from her goes to the cupboard opens the door takes out a small box of bird feed
as his hand approaches the door
the birds are watching him
his hand hesitates
then his thumb and forefinger lift the small catch on the cage door
his fingers open the door
cautiously in tight closeup his hand goes into the cage
the birds sit and watch
one of them tweets
he removes the small feeding tray puts the bird seed into it replaces it in the cage
the birds hesitate another moment
then tweeting they begin to eat
as mitch closes the door to the cage
melanie is slumped against the wall
he goes to her and takes her in his arms
wearily she raises her head
the sound of the shuffling pecking clawing birds is everywhere around them
holding her you should have left when you wanted to
she shakes her head
youd have been safe in san francisco
i dont want to be safe
i want to be with you
there is something pathetically comic about her voice like a small childs confused but defiant
holding her close mitch laughs and she laughs with him
exhausted they stand in each others arms laughing in that weary silly dead of night sort of way
the lights go out
in the darkness the power
the screen is totally black for perhaps five seconds
in the blackness we hear the birds clawing and ripping and the sound is enormously magnified
a flashlight suddenly goes on
as he comes to her with the flash
we see them only dimly as he directs the beam upwards
wed better light some of those lamps
pause hold me
in the near darkness we see them embrace and kiss
it is almost black in the room except for the strange effect of the flashlight as he holds it behind her
i think theyre easing off
a kerosene lamp is burning
melanie is awake watching the fire
lydia has fallen into a semi recumbent position asleep on the couch
cathy is curled up in one of the easy chairs
mitch is asleep by the fire
the fire is burning brightly and steadily
the house is almost still
there is no longer the sound of the clawing and pecking but there is another sound now the sound of something falling or dropping in a steady dribbling difficult to
listening to the curious sound trying to fathom its meaning
as she turns toward him
still whispering mitch
seeing this making her decision
the sound is still coming from somewhere in the house
she decides to let mitch sleep picks up a very long flashlight
as she goes through the house checking
she stops in the entry hall plays the flashlight over the furniture piled against the door
everything seems all right
she goes into the kitchen again checks the door and then plays the beam on the boarded windows
satisfied she goes down the corridor outside the bedroom
she opens the first bedroom door enters goes to the windows plays the beam on them
everythings all right
she comes into the corridor again opens the second bedroom door again checks windows and leaves
climbing the steps to the attic
she stops outside the first door upstairs opens it goes into the room plays the light on the windows
she comes out into the corridor goes to the second bedroom opens the door enters walks to the windows
they are boarded securely
she is starting back toward the door when she stops
a pile of chipped and broken plaster
turning the flashlight up toward the ceiling
a huge hole in it showing moonlit sky outside
turning her eyes from the ceiling determination on her face and suddenly her eyes open wide
sitting in the darkness staring at her
wings spread in the beam of light
backing to the door
the owl hits her sends her staggering back causing the door to slam shut
she looks up at the a swarm of mixed birds coming through the hole and down toward her
in the room swinging the lighted flashlight as the birds attack her
in the room as the owl hits her full in the face
swinging the flashlight as the birds attack her
grotesque and silent as she struggles with them
the room is a crossing cacophony of mixed light beams and fluttering wings
melanie open the door
he hurls himself against it
inside the room where melanie struggles we hear his hammering on it
melanie is overwhelmed by the birds
she falls to the floor the flashlight beside her
in the spreading rays of the light we see the frantic fluttering of wings as the birds cover her
there is a stronger assault on the door by mitch outside
screaming mitch get her out of there
melanie collapsed at the base of the door is no longer in view
neither are the birds whose fluttering shadows we see on the door as mitch again hits it from outside
the door begins to open
as the door bursts inward and he stumbles into the room
he begins swinging at the birds immediately reaching down for melanie fighting off the attack at the same time
he begins dragging her out of the room
her clothes have almost been shredded from her body and her face is torn and bleeding
we catch only quick glimpses of her near nudity as mitch pulls her into the corridor and then holding the door shut behind him with one hand delivers swinging furious
blows at the few birds that have escaped into the corridor
mother get a rope
oh my god look at her
shouting get a rope
she rushes off
he struggles grotesquely with the birds
there is a wild fury in him and a methodical dedication
he will not allow them to defeat him
a large bird strikes his hand knocking the club from it
as the bird strikes at his face
he reaches out with his hands grasping the bird letting go of the door knob
another bird flutters into the corridor
in anger and desperation as he throttles the bird with his hands
he reaches behind him to grab the doorknob again and is immediately attacked by the other bird
as she runs up the steps and into the corridor carrying a heavy piece of rope
mitch grabs the bird and hurls it angrily to the floor
lydia is staring down at melanie in terror and compassion
he takes the rope from her loops it over the doorknob pulls it taut across the hallway and ties it to the bannister sealing the door
he turns immediately to melanie picks her up and carries her to the steps lydia following
as they go downstairs cathy
get a blanket and some bandages
at the foot of the stars on the verge of tears is she all right
cradled against mitchs shoulder her face bleeding profusely
as he carries her into the living room but her down on the couch
just lie there and keep still
cathy rushes to them with a roll of bandages and a blanket
by the light of the lantern mitch drapes the blanket over melanie and then begins unrolling the bandage
but his hands are trembling and he drops it
let me do that mitch
she picks up the bandage
i can handle it
i know you can
her eyes meet his but id like to
silently she begins working on melanie
weakly please dont mess me up with bandages mrs
but she begins cleaning the wounds taping bandages over the cuts
the house is still
she works silently and quickly
as she works im not very good at this mitch
youre doing fine
apologizing i mean
i want to
raising her eyes
the room is silent
there is nothing to hear
god have mercy theyre gone
as he goes to the front door and cautiously moves away the table and chair
he opens the door a crack
through the crack
daylight is almost here
there are no birds visible
from outside as mitch opens it wider
the door is scarred and splintered
as he opens the door one or two dead birds spill into the room
he steps out into the yard
lydia is directly behind him
a shambles all the windows broken
the same pattern
but theyll be back
we wont be here
where can we go mitch
theres no place to go
i want to try for san francisco
there are buildings there
steel and concrete
shaking her head wed never make it
theyre probably all over the road
we have to try it
a long silence we cant stay here
silence melanie needs help
silence mother the house wont take another attack
when we get to san francisco
pause if theyre already there
they wont be
if they are
well worry about that when we get there
im frightened terribly frightened
i dont know whats out there mitch
what do we have to know mother
were all together we all love each other we all need each other
what else is there
mother i want us to stay alive
nodding then after a pause i started to say
you dont have to
he holds out his hand to her
i think wed better get started
it is covered with the eerie half light that comes just before dawn a light that persists throughout all of the following until the penultimate shot in the picture
the silence is deafening
there is not a bird in sight
the door to melanies convertible are open as she and mitch come out of the house together and he helps her to the car
he puts her in the back seat tucks the blanket around her
in the background is the pickup truck too small to hold all of them
lydia comes to the door and quickly crosses the yard not looking down at the dead birds
cathy appears in the doorway to the house
she is carrying the cage of lovebirds
she hesitates just outside the doorway
she looks at mitch
looking back at her
across the expanse of the desolated yard
may i take them mitch
he does not answer
she continues looking at him
they havent harmed anyone
with a slow nod well put them in the trunk cathy
he takes the birds from her and goes to the back of the car
the camera stays on cathy who gets into the car on the front seat
mitch comes around the other side of the car stops and looks toward the trees
covered with waiting birds
getting into car
be careful with that door
cathy closes the door gently and almost soundlessly
mitch does the same with his door
weakly mitch if they hear the car starting
if they see movement
well take it slow until we get to the main road
pause are you ready
turning the key
the motor springs to life
anticipation on all the faces
he takes a deep breath here we go
from the outside as it creeps out of the yard
the bay is still the road is still the car makes barely a sound as it passes the gate and starts down the road
as they begin driving slowly
the wires are down
a small fire is burning in the brush where the wires made contact
the car continues to move
it turns the first bend in the road
she gasps quickly
standing waiting silently
as the tension begins to starts
as they approach the derelict barge
it is covered with waiting seagulls
her lip begins to tremble
turning toward the side of the road ahead
covered with waiting birds
whispering mitch lets turn back
as the car passes
a barricade has been set up on the front porch and a man is leaning over it dead a shotgun in his hands
the porch is covered with waiting birds
at the boarded window we see a woman and child peering from a gap
as it threads its way slowly and cautiously along the winding road to town
the birds are sitting on some of the still standing wires watching waiting
full shot the town approach through the windshield as the car turns a bend in the road
there are thousands of birds ahead on every gutted and smoldering rooftop on every pole on every fence
as he stops the car and looks ahead
in the middle of the road stopped
ahead are the birds
frightened try not to reveal her fear
can we turn back
i dont think so
if we get through town i think well be all right
there is a long silence
it is melanie who has the strongest reason for fearing the birds
it is melanie her fear growing who makes the decision
then go ahead mitch
as it begins moving forward again at an excruciatingly slow rate of speed into the town and the waiting birds
as she turns to look out the window on her side
as the car moves past them slowly
closing her eyes
through the windshield
the roof and sills are covered with birds
the window is smashed in canned goods are strewn all over the sidewalk bolts of cloth run in a riot from the open door and across the road dead people
are lying in the gutter
but in the hotel we see some faces behind broken windows
the tension on their faces as the car approaches them
the windows are all broken and merchandise is lying on the sidewalk
birds are everywhere waiting
lying on the sidewalk clutching a television set in his arms
strained looking at the road ahead
a clear sky a bird free stretch almost as a prayer here we go
he rams down on the accelerator as mitch rams the accelerator to the floor and it zooms ahead in a burst of speed
wrenching at the wheel as the car turns a bend
through the windshield as a flock of birds take wing immediately ahead
from the inside as birds flutter against it
from the inside as a beak slashes it letting in a thin line of light
wrenching at the wheel again another bend
navigating the sharp bends in the road as birds streak at it in straight lines
in the back seat as several slashes appear in the roof over their heads letting in more light
more slashes more light in scattered beams
her fear growing as the scattered light beams bring back the memory of the attic room and her flashlight battle with the owl
more slashes building the beak thrusts combining with the incoming beams of light in a weirdly horrifying way
almost a prayer dear god
please please what have we done
and then in anger at the roof and the birds cant they leave us alone
shrieking it med
shot the car interior all the passengers as the roof suddenly rips back
from inside the car hovering over it the moment the roof tears back
this is too much for her
she screams at sight of the birds and then turns her face into lydias shoulder
as lydia recognizes melanies need
she puts her arm around melanies shoulder and gently soothingly holds her close
racing along as the birds hover over it
his face screwed in anguish tears rolling down his cheeks as he grips the wheel and hits the gas pedal
streaming canvas ribbons behind it
it turns another bend in the road
it is arrow straight no curves
in a burst of speed as it hits the straightaway
it begins to outdistance the birds
the gap widens
a flock of birds attacks it from the side of the road but it speeds into them and through them
the gap grows wider and wider
they are well ahead of the birds now
were losing them
only a nod his face streaming tears
as they fall way behind now the car moving swiftly into the distance
on the back seat
melanie begins sobbing in a sudden release of tension
lydia in compassion and tenderly cradles melanies head on her shoulder
melanie her eyes glistening looks ahead through the windshield
all their faces visible
do you think theyll be all right
in the trunk
can they breath
with the faintest smile i think theyll be all right honey
there is hope on their faces as the car streaks into the wind
not a wild exuberance but a relaxation of tension
they stare ahead through the windshield and then they squint their eyes against the sudden sunrise ahead and mitch reaches up to turn down the sun visor
it looks clear up ahead
moving away from the camera fast into magnificent sunrise over the crest of the hills
further and further into the distance it goes
