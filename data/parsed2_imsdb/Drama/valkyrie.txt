written by christopher mcquarrie nathan alexander january i swear by god this sacred oath that i shall render unconditional obedience to adolf hitler the fuhrer of the german reich and
that i shall at all times be prepared as a brave soldier to give my life for this oath
and from out of the blackness a voice
a man speaking in german faint at first crackling over the radio
subtitles translate the voice of adolf hitler
once again i dont know how many times it has been now an attempt has been made on my life
i speak to you tonight for two reasons
first so that you can hear my voice and know that i am unhurt
and second so that you may know the details of a crime without parallel in german history
a lonely airfield
a nazi officer and his aide stand rigid by a gleaming limousine
the officers uniform denotes a man of high rank a man of weight
tresckow smokes a cigarette his arm the only movement in the frame
pull back to reveal the airstrip is surrounded by army group vehicles and personnel sd and ss escorts photographers aides nazi party dignitaries etc
all frozen like statues
whatever is going on its big
the faint sound of distant airplanes brings tension subtle but sharp
approaching the field are three focke wulf condors escorted by a formation of messerschmitt fighters
silence gives way to an escalating roar that seems to have no maximum
one by one the massive four engine condors land while the fighters roar overhead and circle the airfield
the condors come to rest and needing no introduction adolf hitler alights from the lead plane obscured by the surrounding platoon of heavily armed ss guards
note hitler is obscured throughout the entire sequence proving how inaccessible he truly was
tresckow and his aide step forward to greet hitler but they are pushed back by ss guards
the fuhrer marches past without so much a glance at his hosts or their waiting limo
to tresckows surprise a second limousine roars onto the airfield from out of nowhere
it is dirty the windscreen spotted with bugs from a long drive
hitler gets in the dirty car and speeds off
its not so much your car he doesnt trust
its your driver
tresckow and his aide turn
standing behind them is the consummate nazi he is always scribbling notes in a small datebook
without looking up brandt hops into the limo they brought for hitler
tresckow and his aide share a glance and get in
a beat later they are speeding after hitlers car
hitlers headquarters for the eastern front is bustling
security is tight everyone is on edge
long tables packed with soldiers straining their necks to get a glimpse of their leader at the head table but he is obscured by his detail of ss guards
one man dares to approach
the room falls silent
hitlers personal chef places a tray before the fuhrer producing a knife and fork cutting a bite
we think he is going to hand feed hitler until he places the food in his own mouth chewing slowly deliberately
we wait for him to die
when he doesnt hitler begins to eat
the rest of the room relaxes slightly and digs in
angle on seated further down the table are tresckow and his aide
between them once again is brandt eating like a pig still making notes in his book
managing the fuhrers security must be quite an undertaking
in between mouthfuls irregularity is the fuhrers precaution of choice
i can assure you hes safe here
enjoy your meal
brandts look says dont be ridiculous
he cleans his plate in seconds
then he gently dabs his mouth takes out his datebook and starts writing once again the precise man we saw on the airfield
i understand youre returning to berlin this afternoon
could i trouble you to deliver a package to colonel stieff
brandt nods again too busy writing to notice the knowing glance tresckow shares with his aide
tresckow and his aide are hunched over two bottles of cointreau on a large desk next to two pairs of british clams a small black plastic casing held together by
magnets and adhesive tape
tresckow inserts a short pencil shaped fuse through the narrow opening
all that remains exposed is a small glass capsule
tresckow turns his attention to the bottles of cointreau
the condors engines roar ready for take off
soldiers stand at attention as hitler boards
brandt is with him scribbling in his ever present datebook
tresckow and his aide approach
tresckow gently handles a carefully wrapped package
close on tresckow presses a key against the side of the package crushing the glass capsule inside
the explosive armed now he hands it to brandt
with my regards to colonel stieff
brandt accepts the gift looking up from his book
he studies the familiar shape
you better hope i dont get thirsty on the flight
tresckow politely smiles hiding his nerves having just handed a bomb to hitlers head of security
brandt unknowingly carries it onto the plane with hitler
the door to the condor is sealed behind him along with we hope the fuhrers fate
tresckow looks at his watch and we dissolve to a clock shows us that thirty minutes have passed
tresckow and his aide are seated on either side of a desk staring at the telephone
three hours later
the ashtray is overflowing but tresckow and his aide have not moved
the phone barely rings before tresckow answers
he doesnt say a word he only nods and hangs up
it takes a moment for the gravity of this to set in
what about the
tresckow is already dialing the telephone
get me colonel brandt
staying cool colonel
i trust you landed safely
i hate to trouble you but theres been a bit of a mix up
it seems you have the wrong bottles for colonel stieff
do still have the package
then i can be at your office first thing tomorrow morning to pick it up
terribly sorry for the inconvenience
tresckow slowly hangs up the phone
do you think he knows
tresckow shrugs opening a bottle of cointreau and pouring two glasses with a shaking hand
theres only one way to be sure
an early morning fog blankets the ground obscuring our view
footsteps echo through the cavernous hallways
tresckow marches with purpose through the numerous security checkpoints
it is a long suspenseful walk
he is aware of someone walking up behind him getting closer
we think hes done for but a bespectacled middle aged officer overtakes him and whispers what happened
i can only guess the altitude caused the fuse to malfunction
first the beer hall memorial day now this
someone is watching over that sonofabitch i swear it
weve been discovered
tresckow halts and faces olbricht expressionless
what makes you think osters been arrested
the gestapo came for him last night
tresckow thinks for a beat and resumes walking
olbricht hurries after him
did you hear what i said
the gestapo could have arrested him for anything
find a replacement
theres no one we can trust
not in berlin
then stop looking in berlin
just then they approach the final threshold a sentry guards an office marked olbricht stops regarding the door with dread
but tresckow presses on reaching the door about to enter when your pistol please
tresckow plays it cool removing his pistol from its holster and handing it over
and with a nod to olbricht tresckow squares his shoulders and enters brandts office
brandt is at his desk writing as always
tresckow notices brandts pistol sitting within arms reach
a clock ticks loudly
finally brandt puts his pen down stands and salutes but the gesture is almost casual
youll forgive me general
this little round up has had me writing reports all day
a plot against the fuhrer
tresckow makes a good show of laughing that off
who would even have the balls
youd be surprised the number of cowards in this army that would be willing to stand against the reich
only if the fuhrer were dead of course
its one thing to think you know whats right
what matters is having the strength to do it
brandt produces the package putting it on the desk in front of him
is this what youve come for
staying cool tresckow reaches for it perhaps we should open it
tresckow freezes studies brandts cold smile
i beg your pardon
brandt sits back smiles
does he know
youve come a long way
you must be thirsty
i wonder how the fuhrer who does not partake would feel about an officer who did so on duty
brandts smile fades
we cant decide why
he picks up the package carelessly
tresckow stays cool despite the armed explosive just a few feet away
i took you for another sort general
and we realize he really did just want a drink
he knows nothing about what the package hides
and i you
tresckow reaches out grabbing the package and bang
the sound of an explosion o
takes us to moving rapidly through an olive grove in the otherwise wasted desert
a column of tanks trucks and heavy equipment flow by with a sense of barely contained chaos
men dismantle tents from around others dumping documents into burning oil drums
in the middle of it we find a tall handsome young officer age
he wears an afrika korps uniform complete with colonels badges staying cooler than the other side of your pillow
he directs men this way and that holding back panic
a jeep speeds up to him from the distance driven by a young lieutenant
colonel stauffenberg sir
a new headquarters has been established at mezzouna
im to take you there
stauffenberg looks over the scene expressionless
now they tell us to disengage a day late
no matter how many times we tell command the reality they always manage to leave us but he stops himself containing his rage
colonel the enemy is less than five kilometers from here
youve done all you can
stauffenberg glances at his right hand contemplating a ring on his finger
after a beat i wonder
was there even a point in our coming to tunis
to get taken prisoner it seems
stauffenberg smiles bitterly and gets in the jeep as boom
the first bomb explodes before we even see the tight formation of british fire bombers overhead
fighter planes strafe with machine guns
artillery blasts strike in front and behind the retreating column
the th panzer division is trapped
panic hits the column like a tidal wave
stauffenberg taps the young lieutenant who drives into the melee
soldiers abandon their vehicles but cover is in short supply and many are left in the open
so they run
dozens are gunned down by the assailing fighters
the survivors watch in horror as the fighters slowly turn to make another run
in a panic the soldiers run the other direction halted by a jeep blocking the way
stauffenberg stands in the passenger seat
the men calm when they see the colonel trusting him
they turn and watch the formation of planes complete their turn and bear down gaining speed
knees tense some jerking from the natural inclination to flee
they do despite the menace of the planes engines growing louder meaner
the confused pilot takes in the mass of motionless men below
his finger tenses on the trigger and
the mob of soldiers breaks some right some left as the fighters open fire on what had been the center of their mass
unable to change course quickly enough they spray their lead into the sand
in that same instant stauffenberg drops into his seat the young lieutenant jams the jeep in drive and a wave of hot lead misses them by mere feet
stauffenberg watches his men regroup waiting out the turning squadron
theyve got the idea now
he turns to his lieutenant who smiles admiringly
but stauffenbergs eyes widen
he grabs his lieutenants head and jams it down revealing a stray fighter coming up from behind
stauffenberg ducks out of frame shielding the young lieutenant with his body
blood sprays across the jeeps windshield before bullets rip it to pieces leaving only clear blue african sky
and then the explosion
a fast clicking
heels on linoleum
a beautiful dignified woman keeps herself from running
she is nina von stauffenberg stauffenbergs wife and mother of his four children
beside her is berthold von stauffenberg stauffenbergs older brother
they reach the door of a private hospital room just as a doctor comes out
nodding gesturing to berthold the colonels brother berthold
perhaps before you see the colonel we should go to my office and i will see my husband now
the doctor wants to argue but ninas eyes shut him down
he opens the door and they enter to find a mass of mummy like bandages with only small openings around the mouth and one eye
the arms and hands are also wrapped in heavy dressing
no movement but for the rise and fall of the patients chest
berthold cannot look
holding back her anguish nina bravely turns to the doctor
hes been constant with fever but he refuses any pain killers
the right hand has been amputated above the wrist
hes lost the fourth and fifth fingers on the left
couldnt save the left eye
berthold covers his face
nina is a rock
he had a ring on his right hand
where is it
his hand was amputated in the field
im afraid thank you
as in that will be all
the doctor leaves
nina sits beside her husband
she shows him a photo of four beautiful children three boys and a girl
stauffenberg tries to speak but cant
his eye begins to tear
nina removes a ring from her finger placing it on a chain with a cross she takes from around her neck
it is identical to the ring stauffenberg wore in africa
close on the engraving inside the band finis initium end beginning
nina places the ring and chain on her husbands chest her hand lingering
she cannot hold the tears back any longer
she stands and turns away not wanting her husband to see
berthold takes her place
stauffenberg struggles to speak
berthold puts an ear to the hole where stauffenbergs mouth is making out his question even if we cant
berthold debates answering then weve lost north africa
close on that one eye staring at us closes
stauffenbergs bandages are gone a black patch covering what had been his left eye
the chain with the cross and ring from nina hangs around his neck
another patient lies motionless in the next bed
a mans belongings tell you more about him than he ever could
stauffenbergs side of the room is neatly arranged books of poetry and philosophy are well worn
beside them are his own writings the print meticulous and flowing
up to a certain date
after that a new child like hand has taken over
a family photograph shows the stauffenbergs of another generation wealthy aristocrats from a bygone era
he is a teenager in this photo and smiling broadly
a smile he left in africa
stauffenbergs three fingers push a cotton ball under his eyepatch to dab the empty socket
then he goes to button his shirt
holding his collar in his teeth he tries to do the buttons with the use of only three fingers on his left hand
it is heartbreaking to watch
he is about to give up when he notices a figure looming in the doorway
he winces at the sight of stauffenbergs deformities
i dont know what i ever did with ten
olbricht manages a smile he moves to speak but stauffenberg beats him to it
im wanted in berlin
are you asking as a member of the high command
olbricht contemplates his answer
he carefully closes the door behind him nervously glancing at the patient in the next bed
you can speak openly general
he died just before you came in
finally we could use your help
im a field officer
olbricht steps closer speaking openly now
this war cant be won in the field
thats unfortunate for me
you cant honestly believe youll make a difference on the front im a soldier general
i serve my country
it makes no sense
you opposed hitler you opposed the war
the people chose otherwise and here we are
now we have to win
you know what will happen if we dont
if we win it will still be hitlers germany
we all took an oath general
olbricht nods resigning
he realizes it is no use
finally he produces a blue velvet box opening it to reveal a brilliant gold medal
on behalf of the fuhrer
stauffenberg takes the medal and studies it
im a twin you know
olbricht is as confused as we are
my brother died the day after we were born
what the hell is he talking about
i was lying in the desert covered in blood sure i was going to die
i tried to think about my wife my children
but my mind kept drifting to my dead brother
how i would finally be with him
how i would finally be whole again
he snaps out of his thoughts holding up his arm
this is my reward for what happened to my men
its all i deserve
stauffenberg nonchalantly tosses the medal into a nearby bedpan
close on a field of white
a three fingered hand enters the frame gently placing a medal identical to the one just saw
pull back to reveal stauffenberg done up in his finest dress uniform placing said medal on an unconscious wounded soldier
an aide stands behind him carrying a silver tray stacked with many boxes containing such medals
pull back further to reveal stauffenberg stands between two long rows of beds each with a wounded soldier
those that can respond to stauffenberg do so with reverence
the ward is eerily silent
with only three fingers stauffenberg cannot pin the medals to his men
he has to settle for simply laying them on a each soldiers chest or a pillow
with each medal he presents the task becomes harder to watch
suddenly stauffenberg freezes finding himself looking at the young lieutenant his driver in africa
the young man is a mass of bandages his legs gone his face smashed
close on stauffenbergs face the reality of africa taking the wind out of him
over this we hear a familiar clicking of heels and
stauffenbergs boots pound the floor as he rushes for the door desperate to get out barely able to breathe
at first he does not hear colonel
a hand grabs his shoulder
stauffenberg turns ready to strike
he stops when he sees the doctor holding a small square box
another sort medal perhaps
i dont want the damn th the doctor opens the box to reveal a glass eyeball sitting atop a layer of satin staring blankly back at stauffenberg
when will you be going back to the front
stauffenberg just stares back at the eyeball
im not going to the front
im needed in berlin
the city sleeps
an unsettling image knowing that in war quiet can turn to chaos in the blink of an eye
soft knocking at the front door is further muffled by heavy black out curtains
a young officer enters the frame dousing the lights parting the curtains and opening the door to reveal a shadowy figure on the stoop
the figure steps into the half light to reveal his fresh scars and eye patch
and from the dark quiet of the foyer we cut to
the air is thick with cigar smoke and harsh words
a dozen men some officers some civilians are fighting bitterly everyone talking at once
stauffenberg enters unnoticed escorted in by the young officer who immediately ducks out again
stauffenberg scans the faces in the room
we recognize olbricht and tresckow
with them we find
a distinguished gentleman in his early sixties beside him is a rough hewn charismatic man despite his years
a face millions might follow
he is and finally a grandfatherly sort with surprisingly kind eyes sitting outside the fight tired and saddened by it
he is not a man hes a lunatic
he doesnt drink he doesnt fuck
he has no weakness to exploit no vice to manipulate
his only passion is complete control
how can you expect to reason with him
after this most recent failure id say weve no other choice
confront hitler now and youll end up with piano wire for a neck tie
our only option is the central solution
hes a man like any other
flesh and blood
take him head on and
ill say this for you doctor
youre certainly delusional enough to take hitlers place
eyes narrowing when that day comes ill be sure to remember you
i doubt youll remember much of anything
dammit tresckow and the shouting resumes
it is beck who finally sees stauffenberg
he touches tresckows arm
he in turn nudges olbricht and so on
a moment later the room is silent all eyes on the colonel
everyone is a little embarrassed
olbricht clears his throat gentlemen may i present colonel stauffenberg
hes been reassigned to my office at the war ministry
to stauffenberg colonel may i introduce these men need no introduction
beck stands shaking stauffenbergs hand
i apologize for this unfortunate
on behalf of everyone welc but before he can finish beck is seized with a gravelly cough that sends an uncomfortable chill through the room
he is very ill
to the others i havent welcomed him
where does he stand
for gods sake
re stauffenberg hes a field officer
he knows the army better than any of us
i want to hear his opinion
to stauffenberg all right
what do you think colonel
confront hitler force him to resign
or the central solution
but before stauffenberg can answer central solution
you soldiers are all the same
say what you mean
thats a laugh coming from a politician
the army will follow diplomats before they follow assassins
they follow a butcher now
what difference does it what makes you think the army will follow you at all
the room quiets down
beck hides a slight smile
he likes stauffenberg already
oust him kill him
that isnt what matters
how do you plan to take control of the government when hitler is gone
then a wave of laughter
the balls on this guy
i beg your pardon colonel but you are in the presence of men who would have been hitlers inner circle
instead we resigned
we put our principles above personal gain
we have the have the respect of the people
and the army
with all respect sir you put too much faith in your popularity
to goerdeler pointed all of you do
now see here colonel you said yourself im a field officer
you all may understand government but i know the men
a great many of them may hate hitler but they all fear him they fear himmler goebbels the whole of the reich
that kind of fear wont just die with hitler
and as for respect the army and the people respect only one thing
and if just one man questions that authority you can lose them all
to beck pointed they were fooled into following hitler
how will you fool them force them into following you
the conspirators look at one another again unsure of how to answer
for stauffenberg it is a dreadful revelation
a depressed stauffenberg walks down the deserted night streets
silent but for the echo of his footsteps
across the street an old woman peers nervously out her window
the instant stauffenberg makes eye contact she steps back drawing the curtains
he approaches a cozy brick cottage the berlin home he shares with his brother berthold
he is surprised when he looks through the window to find four children laughing and playing the sound of music on a phonograph
in the next house over he catches sight of a teenage boy the picture of aryan youth watching him suspiciously from the upstairs window
it seems everyone is watching everyone in hitlers german
stauffenberg comes through the front door the sound of the phonograph blaring now
meet the children they chase one another around the house in their pajamas making such a racket that the phonograph skips
it will do so throughout the scene
the children see stauffenberg and charge screaming he scoops them up one by one and kisses them instantly putting the days events behind him
berthold follows them into the room smiling
to children what are you doing here
i thought i left you in bamberg
to berthold its a wonderful surprise
thank you brother
nina nervously fixes her hair in the mirror
look down to reveal a small datebook with a smaller monthly calendar in the corner of the page
a red dot marks one date in particular followed by black dots for each day that has passed since
she turns sideways smoothing her dress over her belly
in every way she indicates to us that she is pregnant
she tucks the datebook under some sundries in her luggage and rushes down to greet her husband
we stay in the room hearing her greet stauffenberg o
laughter at childrens antics we cannot see
the phonograph skips
we want to go see them in their happiness
instead we linger on stauffenbergs dresser neat and orderly
we focus on a photograph of the family from happier times
beside it is a small box containing a glass eye
stauffenberg and nina dance with one another to the delight of the children
we gradually push in tight on their faces watching an entire conversation take place without dialogue
each has a secret the other can guess
stauffenberg looks at nina then her belly first realizing and then questioning
nina smiles and nods
stauffenberg hugs her delighted but his delight is tainted with worry
then the tables turn
nina looks at stauffenberg as if divining his secret
his face never changes a statue with that same tainted smile
in her face we see slow grim realization
she may not know exactly what is going on but she knows it is something
she does her best to keep smiling for the children
after the longest of moments she nods
then she puts her head on his shoulder hiding her fears
it is an important moment
read it again taking the time to picture it in your mind
then leave it alone
done right its a beautiful scene about a man his family and the fate of the world
nina reads a story to the children in the adjoining room an idyllic scene
the sound of the phonograph is soft and constant
stauffenberg picks at a late dinner now adept at the use of only three fingers
berthold sits across from him deeply troubled by whatever conversation we have just missed
they speak in hushed tones
what do you mean you quit
i came to join the resistance not some sewing circle of discarded generals and politicians
beck is a just and capable man
as for goerdeler well hes popular
hell make a good chancellor
like hitler before him yes
lately i have to wonder if germany is even fit to choose her own destiny
you cant blame the people for this
you have to see the beginning of something to know how itll end
its no different than a farmer watching the corn grow
one day its over his head
plenty of people thought the greatest offenders are not the ones who thought better but the ones who sensed better
what are you trying to say
i seem to remember you telling me about reports from the ukraine the ss forcing jews to dig their own graves
you said then that hitler should be removed
an officers duty you said
i said senior officers
the only men that can get to him
perhaps it doesnt matter that you succeed
stauffenberg looks at berthold like he is crazy but perhaps it only matters that you try
dont you see
someone has to stand up and show the world that not all of us were like him
even if they could remove hitler they cant hope to seize power
for gods sake they have no plan
then give them one
find a way
he puts a hand on stauffenbergs arm
evil happens when good men do nothing
before stauffenberg can answer new music comes blasting from the phonograph o
the unmistakable sound of wagners ride of the valkyries
children that is far too he is cut off by the appearance of his four children all wearing cloaks made of bed sheets pots for helmets and brandishing makeshift swords
they charge into the room singing loudly and attacking their father
he does his best to defend himself with one hand
their commotion causes the phonograph to skip
and youd think thats where it ends
we even pull back creating that effect
it takes a moment to notice the wailing sound were suddenly hearing is not on the phonograph
nina hears it first then stauffenberg and berthold
finally the children freeze and the phonograph skips without their help
the glasses on the table rattle
now we hear the wailing quite clearly
the adults herd the children out of the room
muffled concussions cause the phonograph to skip frequently turning wagners masterpiece into a stutter
the family rushes down the stairs huddling in a corner adults holding shivering children
the bombs are closer louder
the wagner the siren the explosions fray the nerves
stauffenberg reaches for nina in the darkness finding her belly
her hand clamps around his around their unborn child
so close the children scream
dust and debris fall from the ceiling
the needle rakes the phonograph upstairs going back to the beginning
close on stauffenberg on his eye
his thoughts as the bombs fall all around his home a moment of profound realization
move across the room to the phonograph looking down at the spinning on the turntable
the camera begins to turn until all the world around us is spinning and only the record is still
we read one word of the title of the quite clearly valkyrie
stauffenberg faces the top members of the resistance
weve already considered valkyrie
it isnt suitable
not as its currently written
what is valkyrie
tresckow explains even as he studies stauffenberg curious
what does he have in mind
the reserve army has thousands of men all over the city most of them not even in uniform
valkyrie is top secret plan to mobilize those men in a national emergency
hitler designed it himself to crush any internal unrest if hes cut off or killed
and what use is that to us
the orders could be rewritten
a few subtle changes would put those reserve units completely under our command
yes of course but now what would the high command do if they thought say the ss was staging a coup
they would declare a military state of emergency
and initiate operation valkyrie
hitlers own reserve army using hitlers own plan and under our command would automatically seize power in berlin
catching on while we put a new government in place
it will seem as though were fighting for hitler government not against it
but only if hitlers dead
all eyes turn to goerdeler
here we go
that is what youre saying isnt it
the central solution
how else will you make people believe the ss is trying to seize power
im afraid its the only way
im disappointed in you colonel
i thought a man of your background would appreciate a more im a soldier first an aristocrat second
yes but and youre neither doctor
now if you want to be chancellor youll do as youre told
a moment of tension
humiliated goerdeler nods
but he wont ever forget this
to tresckow can this plan be made to work
rewriting the order is one thing distributing it is another
a bomb can be disarmed recovered if it fails
in this case wed be willfully circulating written evidence of high treason
thinks its the best idea weve heard yet
there is one
who is fromm
commander of the home army
olbricht can put the reserve troops on alert but only fromm can actually initiate valkyrie
can we get to him
hes a careerist pig
but one whos gone as high as he can go in hitlers army
its no secret hes not happy about it
perhaps if we offered him a key position in the new regime he could be made to see the light
we dont seem to have a choice
without fromm there is no valkyrie
to olbricht and stauffenberg get him
we end on goerdeler a look of concern on his face
muted shouts from o
someone is getting reamed
fromms adjutant lieutenant franz herber a young dedicated soldier sits at his desk trying to ignore the screaming from the other room in between stolen glances at
pull back to reveal stauffenberg and olbricht waiting patiently sitting across from major john von freyend a dutiful nazi whose face we immediately dont like
he smiles coldly taking pleasure in the shouting o
he stares at stauffenberg studying him making us nervous
fromms door finally opens and a bigger than life nazi storms out
freyend stands holding keitels hat and coat for him
a perfect toady
youre a woman fromm
and a fat one at that
id have you sent to the front if i didnt think youd surrender just to be montgomerys whore
keitel storms out leaving a pall
freyend gives stauffenberg a last once over and follows
general will see you now
stauffenberg and olbricht step inside to find the haggard fromm sits at his desk rubbing his temples
stauffenberg and olbricht share a confident look
surely this guy hates the high command
without looking up to see them what is it you want
fromm looks up
i wanted to introduce you to our new man colonel stauffenberg
ah yes the hero from africa
id offer my hand but you might not give it back
id say the generals lost more important things this morning
but after a tense beat fromm relaxes and laughs taking a cigarette from a box on his desk and nudging it toward them
about time they put a man with balls in this office
have a seat
to olbricht you too if you must
fromm lights a cigarette leans back and exhales a cloud of smoke
we let things sit for awhile
the game of recruitment is about to begin and no one is sure where to start
the longer the quiet the more awkward things seem
finally they tell me youre critical of the war colonel
not that you dont seem to have good reason
i am critical of losing the war general
all wars as in africa are lost through indecision
in the field you mean
hes baiting stauffenberg to talk shit about hitler
i take it thats why youre here
to make decisions
ive made my decision general
i m here to help others make theirs
stauffenberg makes no attempt to shade his delivery
he is quite clearly indicating that he means more
fromm knows it but hes being coy
they say when theres no clear option one should do nothing
were at war
we must act
just what sort of rash action did you have in mind colonel
that would be a decision for the supreme military commander
fromm is getting the message
he takes a deep drag
supreme commander you say
second only to the chancellor
if only i were that man
this war would be going quite differently
we were thinking the very same thing
fromm frowns at olbricht
this was a bit too obvious
stauffenberg shoots olbricht a look
what the hell are you doing
fromm casually stamps out his cigarette in the ashtray and picks up the telephone
olbricht and stauffenberg steel their nerves certain they are going to be reported
but fromm doesnt dial
instead to our relief he disconnects the line
when he is certain that it is dead i dont need to remind you that weve all sworn an oath
that said im going to forget we had this conversation with the understanding that such speak will never occur under this roof again
am i clear
tell your friends that i always come down on the right side
and as long as the fuhrer is alive you know what side that is
raising his hand heil hitler
trying to be upbeat i think that went rather well
a car loaded with luggage
stauffenberg hugs his children one by one before placing them inside
then he turns to face nina
as always there is much to be said that they cannot say
she gently touches the silver chain around his neck the ring and the cross she gave him
they embrace tightly and kiss
she gets in the car looking at him through the back window as she is driven away
as our eyes adjust we realize we are in the middle of the woods
is this a dream
we are drawn toward a flickering light in the distance
from out of the darkness comes a candle held by a nervous almost mousy young woman fraulein von oven
walking just behind her is tresckow
he carries a small but heavy case in one hand
they come to a clearing in the woods and find a strange sight
in the center is a tree stump surrounded by papers including the original orders for operation valkyrie next to a leather valise marked with the seal of the reich
the orders have been meticulously annotated
were you followed
fraulein oven gasps
tresckow turns pistol drawn
the tip of his barrel comes up just inches from stauffenbergs eyepatch
stauffenberg smiles emerging from the shadows
you scared me half to death
well be closer than that before were finished
wearing white gloves fraulein oven opens the case tresckow brought revealing a portable typewriter
she carefully feeds a sheet of crisp parchment into the machine and sets the margins carefully
then she starts typing with remarkable speed
note the sound of typing runs throughout the scene punctuated by the crack of the carriage return each time a little louder
stauffenberg and tresckow carefully pore over the valkyrie orders scribbling copious notes
looking this over im not satisfied that the reserve army is enough to shut down berlin completely
handing over papers yes ive been giving that some thought
we should include any field units that are home on leave
before tresckow can respond more papers ive also drawn up an outline for orders to streamline combat groups in order to quietly concentrate forces at vital points state and government
buildings of course but also the radio and newspapers
tresckow can barely keep up
combat groups will be reorganized as reinforced grenadier regiments
one or two of them can be quickly mobilized eliminating the usual six hour lag
we blitz the government quarter arrest all ministers and party leaders surround all ss and police barracks
any officers who resist will be arrested
a carriage return as loud as a rifle shot
a truck full of soldiers roars past
stauffenberg tresckow and fraulein oven walk across a dimly lit bridge on a foggy night in berlin stopping in the middle
stauffenberg carries a leather valise with the valkyrie orders tresckow carries the typewriter case
they stop at the center of the bridge looking around carefully
no one is in sight but anyone could be watching from the shadows
to the fraulein if anyone comes to you play ignorant
just tell them ill tell that i was serving the german people
then ill tell them to go to hell
both men smile a bit taken aback
von oven shakes each mans hand and walks away swallowed up by the darkness
when she is gone to operation valkyrie
tresckow heaves the typewriter case over the railing and into the water below
they watch in silence as the water settles then
ive been transferred to the front
shocked why didnt you tell me
would you have stayed
then it occurs to stauffenberg
do you think fromm reported us
its more likely just
an unfortunate coincidence
anyway it doesnt matter
you wrote the orders
you know them better than anyone
you dont mean to say im appointing you military leader of the resistance
but olbricht we both know olbricht hasnt the wit or the spine
a million thoughts are running through stauffenbergs mind
but he knows what he must do
one more thing
you were right what you said that first night
its not enough to kill hitler
we need to isolate his chain of command
the slightest confusion could crush us
we need to be certain that no conflicting orders get out after the flash
stauffenberg considers this for a moment
that greatly limits our options of where and when to make our move but its the only way
how will you do it
perhaps its better i dont say
a sad smile and nod from tresckow a moment ago he was in charge
now he has no clearance
god promised abraham that he would not destroy sodom if he could find just ten righteous men
he puts a hand on stauffenbergs shoulder
i have a feeling that for germany it may come down to one
a wild party a small band german officers plenty of women
in stark contrast two gestapo men sip coffee at a corner table keeping a watchful eye on the crowd
a waiter carries a tray of drinks to a rowdy group in the corner who are immersed in the denial common to berlin these days
the waiter serves carefully making sure one particular drink goes to the group toasts and downs their booze
close on fellgiebels smile suddenly fades
he looks into his glass his good mood vanishing
he politely excuses himself over the noise of the rowdy mob and heads for the bathroom
he looks ill
fellgiebel walks to the sink and dumps what is left of his drink in the basin
close on mingling among the melting chunks of ice is a glass eye staring back at him
he scowls in the mirror at stauffenberg waiting
you realize how close i am to hitler
with one word i could have the gestapo make you disappear
why havent you then
fellgiebel checks the stalls to make sure they are empty
stauffenberg collects his glass eye from the sink dabbing it dry on a hand towel
none of my associates know weve been talking if thats what youre afraid of
but you know
and when the ss catch you theyll pull you apart like warm bread
itll be a crime just to have known you then
i warn you
if it means protecting myself i will expose you
do not try to contact me again
fellgiebel heads for the door but stops on you cant report me
maybe if you had when i first approached you youd have been keeping your oath
but now youre just as guilty as so you think that makes me a sympathizer eh
you give a man the choice of betraying a fellow officer or his fuhrer and assume his actions will show you his heart
its not that simple
it is to me
for the last time dont push me to make a decision
i have no choice
its clear now that without you we have no hope of success
fellgiebels silence speaks volumes
you want us to succeed
and what if you do eh
will you be any different from hitler
what of his reich his people the very momentum of history
will all of that let you be something he isnt
there it is
but my pregnant wife our four children the germany i first swore to defend
they demand that i be something different
they demand that i fight for their future even if it means
and for a moment his voice breaks and he chokes back what may be tears
even if it means that i never see them again
in that moment we see a side of stauffenberg we were starting to doubt existed
we see his humanity
this puts fellgiebel in his place
he adjusts his tie and we see the wedding ring on his finger
action is inevitable
as are the consequences
when they come for me ill do what i can to hide what you knew and when you knew it
stepping closer now but dont delude yourself
you were involved in a crime against your country long before you met me
theres still time to redeem yourself
only god can judge you now
the door bursts open startling them both
but it is only a drunken officer and a young woman looking for some privacy
are you two finished or just getting started
the woman laughs
stauffenberg walks out past them leaving fellgiebel with hitlers finest
what first catches our eye is the enormous portrait of hitler looming over stauffenbergs desk
stauffenberg sits before a mountain of paperwork surrounded on all sides by a flurry of secretaries and aides
he looks up to find olbricht hovering in the doorway with that look that says we need to talk
stauffenberg clearly doesnt have the time
leave us please
the staff instantly exits a well oiled machine
stauffenberg unplugs the phone
you play the part of bureaucrat beautifully
its the only time i can relax
theres a man here to interview as your adjutant
adjut what for
no one told you
obviously not youve been promoted chief of staff for the reserve army
some men might find a promotion to be good news
for christs sake
dont i have enough to do
unfortunately your nocturnal activities dont count as service to the reich
ill refuse the promotion
youll do no such thing
dammit i cant handle the work i already this is an opportunity we could never have dreamed of
youre in the inner circle now with genuine access to hitler his advisors his schedule
we need this
were not ready
were moving too fast
not half as fast as the allies
an invasion is coming colonel
any day now
we must act and we must act soon
tresckow may have left you in charge of the central solution but in this world i still outrank you
you will accept the appointment
is that understood
stauffenberg nods grudgingly
the new man is waiting outside
he comes highly recommended
he might even be an ideal candidate
smiling we still need an assassin
stauffenberg lets this sink in
he takes a seat and goes back to work
after a moment a handsome soldier quietly enters
haeften clicks his heels and offers the nazi salute but before he can say the words be seated
thrown haeften sits
stauffenberg continues writing ignoring him
haeften looks up at the portrait of hitler startled when stauffenberg finally speaks do you know how this war will end haeften
the portrait will be un hung
and the man will be hung
stauffenberg looks up looking for a reaction to such frank and treasonous talk
he gets none
he sighs too tired to play games
im engaged in high treason with all means available to me
can i count you in
and the strangest thing a reaction no one would suspect haeften relaxes almost sighs like someone who has at long last found a home
for anything sir
anything at all
anything is a very dangerous word
newsreel footage of d day
allied forces invade normandy
the liberation of europe has begun
but this is not the d day you learned about in history class
this is a german newsreel
in it hitlers forces have nothing to fear
subtitles the allied forces have blundered into the trap awaiting them on the beaches of normandy heroically repelled by the combined might of the german army
it is a glorious day for the reich
at long last the craven enemy has come to europe to face their inevitable defeat at the hands of five thousand ships one hundred thousand men from the combined allied
haeften and stauffenberg ride in a sedan
stauffenberg is in profile the entire time
what about the panzer divisions in they were never dispatched
word is hitler took a sleeping pill
his staff was afraid to wake him
first africa now france
the russians bearing down from the east
sometimes i wonder if hitlers real aim is to leave nothing but scorched earth for all of europe
stauffenberg rubs his forehead
the car stops
soldiers are waiting outside
stauffenberg gets out of the car wearing an ornate dress uniform and carrying a leather valise
he has arrived at a meeting of great importance
he turns to face haeften directly and we are surprised to see both of his eyes for an instant the young lion he once was
but a closer look is unsettling we see the faint scarring one eye glowing and alive the other cloudy and dead
his glass eye
stauffenberg only wore it on special occasions
this is one
maybe this is a blessing in disguise
maybe hell finally listen to reason consider a truce while he still can
well see if i cant convince him
hitlers forboding southern headquarters
stauffenberg walks up a flight of wide marble stairs at the top he sees a group of waiting adjutants quietly smoking cigarettes a clique of devoted nazis
in the group is major freyend the wormy officer we saw outside fromms office
he watches stauffenberg pass aloof
we hate him
just then stauffenberg is greeted by two ss officers who move to physically search him one his body the other his valise
you dont need to search him
angle on fromms adjutant lt
herber approaches waving off the ss
colonel stauffenberg is an honored guest
the hero of africa
the ss officers stand down
herber and stauffenberg share a friendly smile about to speak when fromm walks up on them for gods sake stauffenberg youre he pauses clearly caught off guard when he sees
stauffenberg with two eyes
theyre waiting for you
stauffenberg and fromm enter to the last thing we would expect
hitler and five men some of them almost caricatures their features so distinct
the first man we recognize as keitel the general who reamed fromm
the others we know from history and titles
we have arrived in the sanctum sanatorium of nazi germany on the day after the normandy invasion
but you would never know the tide of the war had just turned against germany
a series of situation maps are scattered before them ignored
only speer seems to be reserved smiling politely but clearly tuned into the present reality
looking closer at goering we see he is wearing heavy make up adding to the already surreal nature of the scene
it is also the first time we are allowed a clear unobstructed view of hitler
i wish to present colonel claus von stauffenberg our new chief of general staff for the replacement army
the laughter stops
hitler and his cronies turn toward stauffenberg looking him over
hitler stands and crosses to him
fromm meets him first whispering in the fuhrers ear perhaps reminding him who stauffenberg is
hitler nods ah yes
he takes stauffenbergs left hand with both of his
we are surprised by his charm
may i say i am honored to meet a hero who has sacrificed so much for germany
if only more of my officers were like you
hitlers cronies smile despite the subtle insult to themselves
to make it worse hitler turns to them
let this man stand as an example to all of you
he is the ideal german officer
fromm nervously clears his throat
mein fuhrer we have asked stauffenberg here today so that he might brief us on mobilizing troops from the home army to support those in normandy
oh yes normandy
that will no longer be necessary
general goering has assured me that normandy is under control
stauffenbergs good eye flickers
are you insane
normandy is a catastrophe
another glance at the situation map shows allied forces over running
but the painted on smiles of hitlers nodding cronies promote the lie
no one has the courage to tell hitler anything close to the truth
somewhere in their eyes is the fear that someone will
mein fuhrer if i may
the situation in normandy is youre dismissed stauffenberg
but send your man home fromm
then bring us some brandy
fromm is stung a man of his rank being treated like a waiter
stauffenberg steps back clicks his heels and salutes just managing to say heil hitler
hitler half waves walking slowly back to his seat
fromm and stauffenberg leave
fromm escorts a visibly shaken stauffenberg to his waiting vehicle
haeften opens the car door for stauffenberg to get in
fromm leans in
i dont know what youve got brewing and i dont want to know
but when the music stops id be much obliged if keitel should find himself without a chair
is fromm saying hes in
is keitels death a condition
hard to say and meant to be
before stauffenberg can inquire fromm slams the door shut and returns to the madness inside the berghof
stauffenberg leans back in his seat mentally calculating his next step
theyre all insane
every one of them except for speer and hes nothing but an architect
stauffenberg puts on his eyepatch before removing his glass eye
he polishes it with a cloth and now it stares at him from his gloved hand
tell beck weve found our assassin
off haeftens confused look ill do it myself
we find ourselves in an empty church
beck is seated in a pew staring straight ahead
stauffenberg sits directly behind him
they cant risk being seen together
they speak in hushed tones
the first thing we notice is how weak and ill beck looks
he struggles to hide a persistent cough
out of the question
it wont work
we need you here in berlin
who else then
who can even get as close
beck knows there is no other choice
valkyrie is very clear
once the order is given the reserve army will automatically seize control of the government with or without me
orders are not enough
they need a man to follow
the right man
stauffenberg knows hes right
the fucking pressure
he thinks for a moment then with a sigh olbricht will oversee operations in my absence
i can be back in berlin three hours after hitler is stauffenberg shuts up lowering his head in prayer as a clergyman passes
once they are again alone three very crucial hours
we both know theres no other way
beck nods resigned
ill tell the others as if on cue beck loses control of his cough
stauffenberg leans forward handing him a handkerchief and putting a reassuring hand on his shoulder until the old mans hacking subsides
im afraid whatever the outcome i wont be there to see it
youre stronger than you think
you might just be the strongest one of all
the sound of children at play takes us to once again the scene idyllic
the stauffenberg children play football in the distance
stauffenberg himself is out of uniform for the first time since the hospital but he does not seem relaxed
nina sits across from him half reading a book half talking to her husband
stauffenberg cannot hear a word she is saying he is miles away
he looks over at his children
one would never suspect that germany has waged a calamitous war and that the country is facing total devastation
after that i thought id take the children to the country for a few days to see my claus
he snaps out of his thoughts
have you heard a word i said
i want you to delay your trip
just for a while
she wants to ask he wants to tell her
finally does this have something to do with
i would just be more comfortable knowing where you are until im back from berlin
things will be different then
once again a couple who know each other well enough to not have to say things plainly
nina is worried but strong
how long until
until we see you
a few days
if all goes well
then we can travel as a family
and if things
dont go well
i love you nina
and i love you
what papa come and play with us
the children kick the ball toward stauffenberg the one sport he can play
he is about to say something to nina but she cuts him off
go be with your children
stauffenberg stands touching ninas cheek and kissing her forehead
we stay on her as he joins the children
she watches them play together seeing her husband laughing for the first time in a long while
her eyes well with tears a mixture of happiness and anguish
too good to last too much to bear
haeften olbricht and stauffenberg stand around a table giving their undivided attention to he empties the contents of two tawny leather briefcases onto the table along with a crude drawing
covered with calculations he produces two brick like lumps wrapped in butcher paper two small caps and two thin metal cylinders
two gram packs of plastic w
enough explosive to cripple a panzer
pointing to caps your detonators
pointing to cylinders your fuses
british time pencils
this acid capsule is your trigger
stauffenberg carefully studies the items before him
when youre ready to arm attach the detonator to the bottom of the time pencil like so
demonstrating insert the entire device into either end of the plastic w crush the acid capsule and youre live
when the acid eats through the wire holding back the trigger spring
youll want to be very far away
what if they search your bag
im one of the inner circle now
theyll make sure i am who i am
beyond that they wont touch me
to mertz how much time do i have
theoretically theres a minute delay
but with the kind of heat you can expect at the wolfs lair id give you minutes tops
this is state of the art
you can have small or precise
might this be just a little too small
the explosion wont do the killing
the air in the room will
he points to the drawing an overhead sketch of hitlers bunker is constructed of reenforced concrete
a steel door no windows
just one of these explosives in a space like that will cause tremendous air pressure
enough to instantly kill everyone present
the second charge will be entirely redundant
of course im all for redundancy
if by some miracle hitler does survive what then
we have an inside man at the wolfs lair in communications
hell notify you immediately following the flash and then sever all contact with the outside world
the others are stunned
just how did you manage that
its my job isnt it
while hitlers inner circle is still regrouping you will initiate valkyrie and seize control in paris and berlin
even if hitler survives well have momentum
to olbricht but as you said yourself it would take a miracle
anyone in that bunker when just one of these goes off is not coming out alive
haeften places the items back in the briefcases
himmler is expected to be at the meeting as well
dont proceed unless you can get them both
that could be difficult
why kill a madman just to have a lunatic take his place
this is goerdelers idea isnt it
the members are in total agreement on this
stauffenberg chews on this pissed
then fucking politicians
ill hold off if the decision is unanimous
and i want another man on the committee
a soldier himself olbricht is insulted
and just who this soldier be
stauffenberg glances at mertz sizing him up
pointing to mertz him
mertzs eyes widen
but stauffenberg and haeften pick up their briefcases and leave without another word
olbricht reaches for the phone and dials
this is general olbricht
order the guard battalion and all army schools near berlin to take up march readiness
stand by for operation valkyrie
a small bunker like room serves as the hub of all military communications
the walls are lined with chattering teletype machines and their operators
close on one teletype in particular
the words are clicking by quickly but we clearly make out
one sergeant helm leans in reading it curious
he tears the sheet out of the teletype and takes it to the officious lieutenant haans officer in charge
he likes his job and how well he does it
handing over the order lieutenant
what about it
this order is calling the reserve army for some sort of stand by action
shrugs looks like a drill of some kind
ive never heard of that
send the order through sergeant
a shrill whistle and a wailing siren take us to
shots of scattered elements of the reserve army coming together taking shape reservists and cadets from all walks of life rush to their homes hastily trading their civilian clothes for
stauffenberg and haeften board a waiting courier plane preparing for departure
both are clutching their briefcases faces like stone
stauffenberg is dressed once again in his ornate formal attire his patch gone glass eye in place
air sirens wail
a sculpted eagle and swastika loom over a large pillared stronghold
from out of the surrounding barracks reserve soldiers scramble to march readiness assembling on the center parade grounds awaiting orders
vehicles move into place along the perimeter
all in all a well oiled machine
hase issuing the alert signal
air sirens wail
reserve soldiers scramble into readiness
vehicles move into place a well oiled machine
we focus on two officers in particular major otto ernst remer commander of the deutschland guard battalion and second lieutenant dr
loyal nazis both
what do you suppose this is all about
probably just a drill
but remer doesnt seem convinced
shots of stauffenberg and haeften deplaning getting into a waiting car slowly making their way to their destination
finally they arrive at est
a acre compound hidden deep in the mosquito infested forests of wilhelmsdorf
security is tight barbed wire fencing checkpoints flak towers machine gun nests trenches land mines
the car carrying stauffenberg and haeften arrives at the first security checkpoint
two guards check identity papers and confiscate pistols from haeften and the driver
stauffenberg boldly extends his valise to one of the guards but rather than reach for it the young soldier snaps to attention and raises his hand in a nazi salute
eyes straight ahead stone like
after an awkward pause to the driver drive on
close on stauffenbergs bag
a series of jump cuts follow the bag through the extensive security layers one must endure before getting to the meeting
id is checked frequently
the bags not once
the men here are hitlers inner circle after all
finally stauffenberg and haeften are escorted toward the bunker where the meeting will be held
pausing stauffenberg looks back over his shoulder to find the communications hut through the open door of the small shack we see a mass of radios and telegraphs
a lone figure stands outside smoking a cigarette
whispering to haeften your man
and it is none other than general erich fellgiebel the man stauffenberg confronted in the bathroom at the officers club so long ago
he and stauffenberg share a long intense stare
finally fellgiebel nods dropping his cigarette and crushing it with his boot
stauffenberg and haeften head inside the impervious bunker through the heavy steel door
stauffenberg and haeften find themselves in a cramped hot windowless room filled with various officers waiting around a large conference table
a moment later hitler enters keitel and fromm follow close behind
heels click in unison
keitel starts the meeting but stauffenberg isnt listening
while all eyes follow hitler stauffenberg watches the door scanning the faces in the room
where is himmler
haeften doesnt see him either
now for the first order of business
fromm i believe you will brief us on blocking divisions for the eastern front
stauffenberg silently excuses himself from the room
we hold on his briefcase
remember where he left it
the phone rings
a waiting mertz grabs it
general olbrichts office
suddenly nervous hold the line
to olbricht stauffenberg says himmlers not at the briefing
he wants to proceed
all color drains from olbrichts face
mertz rolls his eyes and dials a second phone
beck and goerdeler sit impatiently by the telephone waiting for any word on the assassination and impending coup
when the telephone rings beck
he presses the receiver tightly to his ear a look of concern washing over his face
he turns to goerdeler
himmler is not in the briefing
goerdelers reaction is vintage politician
close on a cigarette
we watch as stauffenberg smokes waits looks at his watch the sounds of the meeting going on behind him
he drops his cigarette and we see a pile of three more
he has been waiting while the others deliberate
finally they say no
note intercut between mertz and stauffenberg
stauffenberg is furious
he calms himself
what do you say
mertz looks around makes sure he is alone
i say do it
stauffenberg hangs up the phone
the moment of truth
stauffenberg quietly slips back into the briefing unnoticed
he freezes close on the spot where stauffenberg left his briefcase
well its gone
he looks around frantically
some officers notice him
he gets haeftens attention
mouthing my briefcase
before haeften can answer fromm shoots them both a glare
what the hell are you doing
you are dismissed
and like that the briefing has ended
stauffenberg is sickened the opportunity lost
hitler exits walking right past him
keitel and the rest file out
the last to leave is fromm
that call better have been important
stauffenberg turns coming face to face with freyend keitels hateful toady
he holds the missing briefcase
for a moment were sure the jig is up
he hands it over and leaves
a military sedan skids to a stop outside the guard battalion headquarters
olbricht jumps from the car racing to get general hases attention
large formations of soldiers stand at attention in the hot sun awaiting orders
whispering what the hell is going on
my men have been standing here for an hour
i dont know what to tell them
close on remer the officer we told you to remember standing before the ranks
he eyes hase and olbricht suspiciously trying to hear what they are saying
after a moment hase addresses the men
at ease gentlemen
olbricht addresses the men trying unsuccessfully to hide his nerves
this has been a drill
youre all to be commended for your quick response
the men linger confused until and the men fall out nowhere to go so they just light up and shoot the shit
hagen approaches remer
what did i tell you
but remer is not so sure
the way he stares at olbricht makes us nervous
close on olbricht sees remer looking at him making note of the esteemed knights cross pinned to remers uniform
olbricht leans toward hase
that man there
who is he
he commands the deutschland guard battalion
what about him
get rid of him
dont worry about him
hes an order taker
to the bone
but whose orders
as usual lt
herber sits at his desk and as usual he tries to ignore muted shouts through fromms office door
pull back to reveal stauffenberg and olbricht waiting
they sit across from freyend
a beat later keitel storms out of fromms office his face red with anger
when keitel and freyend are gone herber looks up from his desk with a nervous smile
the general will see you now
stauffenberg and olbricht stand hats in hand
how dare you put the reserve army on standby without my knowledge
you damn near cost me my commission
what in gods name made you think you even had the authority
it was only a drill
dont lie olbricht
not to me
we both know it was no fucking drill
general if i may you may not colonel
you may not do anything
because now youve not only shown me you cant deliver youve painted a target on my back
if i so much as sense you trying to move the reserve army again ill personally have you both arrested
do i make myself abundantly clear
but stauffenberg turns to leave without answering
ill hear you say it colonel
stauffenberg stops glaring at fromm with his one eye
he squares his shoulders clicks his heels loudly and delivers a downright nazi like still managing to make it sound spiteful
he leaves without being dismissed slamming the door
it has been a long day the resistance leaders are all exhausted
beck olbricht witzleben haeften and mertz watch goerdeler circling a rigid stauffenberg
the point of your central solution is to replace hitler so that we can negotiate a truce with the allies
the allies i suspect would be more amenable to a truce
if we today was a matter of indecision nothing more
a military operation in the hands of a politician
stauffenbergs lack of respect infuriates goerdeler
i dont think i am alone when i say your judgement is in question
to the others i would like to take a vote
carl if i may have a word with you in private
if you have something to say ludwig say it here
say it now
theres no need to vote
beck turns to the bar pours two drinks
stauffenberg stiffens ready for the axe
i consider you a friend
and i look forward to the day when we can once again live as free men
but youve become a liability
goerdeler smiles smugly
but the smile fades when beck turns offering a drink to him
im sorry it has to be this way
what are you saying
fellgiebel informed me this evening
himmlers issued an order for your arrest
youll have to leave germany
when weve succeeded with the central solution youll return as chancellor
until then goerdeler stands confronting stauffenberg
this is your doing isnt it
you cant just get rid of me like this
i am the man germany will follow
stauffenberg says nothing
hes too cool
goerdeler looks at the other conspirators but no one is going to speak for him
finally almost in tears
ludwig i beck offers him an envelope
avoid contact with anyone
goerdeler snatches the envelope and sulks out
we could not be happier to see him go
beck coughs turns to stauffenberg
no more indecision
from now on stauffenberg has discretion
i cant issue valkyrie again unless we follow through
if he fails to ill do my job
you just take berlin
close on a telephone
stauffenbergs three fingered hand picks up the receiver and lifts it out of frame
id like to place a call to bamberg please
nina and her children eat supper around a single candle bamberg is experiencing a blackout
though nina manages a tranquil facade she is anything but
angle on the silent telephone in the foreground
we wait for it to ring but it never does
beck enters to find stauffenberg in the front pew staring at christ on the cross
have you made your peace with god then
as best i can
then you have nothing to fear
stauffenberg manages a smile as beck sits
i know the soldier inside me is a traitor
i wonder how ill be judged as a man
in the end we answer only to ourselves
stauffenberg fingers the cross and ring hanging from the chain around his neck
did you reach your wife
bombing in ebingen
i cant get through
ebingen is a long way from bamberg
youve seen to that
you came to us a wounded soldier from africa
now you are both the architect and the assassin
im still trying to understand how this came to be
more to himself like a farmer watching the corn grow
one day its over his head
and the two men look up at the cross in silence
in these waking hours berlin appears quite peaceful
only the distant sound of shelling reminds us that the city is surrounded by war
a tawny leather briefcase sits on a neatly made bed
stauffenberg freshly bathed and wrapped in a towel shaves in front of the mirror
for the first time we see his scars and deformities in full
he looks himself over finally focusing on the chain around his neck contemplating the small cross and the ring its engraving finis initium end beginning
though his face is clean shaven now he continues slowly running the razor down his throat
then he stops pressing the blade a little too hard and bringing blood
it almost seems intentional
close on the box that holds his glass eye staring
stauffenberg has since mastered the process of dressing himself
jump cuts take us from a wounded soldier to an officer of the general staff
close on his crisp white collar picking up a trace of blood from the cut on his throat
haeften holds the door for stauffenberg stepping into a military sedan
for the first time we see berlin in broad daylight the city in ruins
the drive through the rubbled smoky streets is particularly eerie today
haeften and stauffenberg board a three engine courier plane each carrying a leather briefcase
a moment later the plane is taking off
a group of resistance officers talk quietly smoking cigarettes and waiting anxiously
many of the faces we recognize some we see for the first time
we notice witzleben has donned his old military uniform looking a little too proud
beck looks over the faces of these men trying to contain his own fear
his eye catches the door opening and a man in a decorated police uniform entering the room
one by one the men in the room stop talking staring at the police officer
just as we think its over gentlemen may i introduce chief helldorf
hes guaranteed the full support of the berlin police
the men breathe a collective sigh of relief
many shake helldorfs hand
we can begin
beck moves to a table covered with maps of berlin paris and the wolfs lair
hitler has scheduled a military briefing for today at one oclock
stauffenberg will strike regardless of who else is present
as beck speaks we see how things should play out
stauffenberg and haeften are driven in a topless sedan
each carries his leather briefcase
once in position he will signal us once to alert the troops and again after the flash
stauffenberg and haeften quickly get in the sedan the concrete bunker just behind him its steel door closed
they speed out of frame a beat before a muffled explosion rocks the bunker the steel door bulges but holds fast
only a wisp of smoke escapes
soldiers burst into fromms office and arrest the bewildered general without incident
assuming fromm refuses to join us olbricht will take command of the reserve army and initiate operation valkyrie
olbricht takes fromms place and starts making calls
at least this is how it should happen
establishing shots of the idle troops and equipment as they are once again called into action
then hell notify all district commanders between paris and berlin that the ss is attempting to seize power
the reserve army will arrest all ss gestapo and nazi officials
the same soldiers are now storming government buildings and seizing personnel
witzleben and beck march in with armed soldiers
when the time is right witzleben and i will arrive at the war ministry and assume the roles of commander of the armed forces and head of state respectively
goerdeler stands at a radio microphone reading passionately from a prepared script with dramatic gestures painfully reminiscent of hitler
with berlin secured goerdeler will return and address the nation as our new chancellor
then god willing we can negotiate a truce with the allies and spare europe from total destruction
gentlemen this is the most important day of your lives
long live sacred germany
the conspirators salute and leave
beck places both hands on the table to support himself coughing and exhausted
then he looks nervously at his watch
olbricht paces before his desk
mertz watches him anxiously waiting for put the reserve army on standby alert
not until i hear from stauffenberg
not until im sure
but thats not what he noted colonel
the plane touches down and taxis to a stop
stauffenberg and haeften deplane and immediately step into a waiting courier car driven by a young dutiful nazi
second lieutenant kretz
even this early the heat is oppressive
we watch from a distance as the courier car is stopped at the outer checkpoint
once again the guard carefully examines stauffenberg and haeftens identification and takes their pistols before allowing the car to pass
field marshal wilhelm keitels office as the courier car arrives
stauffenberg and haeften are greeted by freyend who shows them to two officers are already waiting
gentlemen may i present colonel claus von stauffenberg chief officer of the reserve army
this is an honor
they say youre the man that will defend berlin from the red army single hand the officer realizes what a faux pas he has made as soon as he says
unfazed stauffenberg smiles raising his briefcase with his single hand
ive got the whole bag of tricks right here
the officers laugh nervously relieved he was not insulted
meanwhile freyend steps toward haeften reaching for the handle of his briefcase
let me take that for you
but haeften snaps the case back
freyend raises a suspicious eye
before he can press colonel stauffenberg
everyone turns to find general fellgiebel standing at the door
everyone stands at attention
at east gentlemen
to stauffenberg general fellgiebel communications
i just wanted to meet the hero of africa
and see if theres anything you need
yes sir there is
im expecting a call of the utmost importance
even if it comes when i am in conference with the fuhrer id appreciate it if you had a man come and get me
fellgiebel and stauffenberg share an instant look of understanding
of course colonel
stauffenberg and the others return it as fellgiebel departs
just then keitel bursts from his office fixing his tie
the meeting has been pushed forward to
mussolini is arriving on the afternoon train and hitler wants to have lunch with him
stauffenberg is excited by a potential bonus
will mussolini be in the briefing
i only wish he were
then some ambitious officer might take the opportunity to shoot the dago bastard
keitel makes a beeline for the door and the others follow like good sheep
stauffenberg holds back however attracting freyends attention
ill need a place to wash up change my shirt
stauffenberg points to the shaving cut on his throat and the tiny blood stain on his shirt
the cut was intentional after all
annoyed freyend motions to the adjoining anteroom
please do be quick
you heard the general
stauffenberg nods in appreciation
he motions for haeften to follow him
freyend watches curious
fast on stauffenbergs heels haeften closes the door
a large portrait of hitler looms watching
stauffenberg positions himself at a small desk with his back to the door
he removes a brick of plastic explosive from his briefcase
whispering youre arming them
stauffenberg quickly unbuttons his shirt taking a clean one out of his bag and putting it on as haeften assembles a fuse
no room for error this time
assume i have ten minutes in this heat
two minutes for the walk one for the security check and one to the bunker
three minutes for the walk back
leaving just three minutes to place the bomb
plenty of time
if the bomb goes off in ten
he carefully inserts the fuse into the explosive
the ring of a telephone startles us
close on the telephone
major freyend speaking
yes hes arrived
they are on their way now
freyend hangs up glancing impatiently at his watch
neatly dressed again stauffenberg carefully places the primed explosive back in his briefcase
he and haeften turn their attention to the second explosive assembling the fuse about to insert it when bang
the door swings suddenly open stopped short by stauffenbergs backside
he nearly drops the fuse
dammit man what is it
its freyend of course trying to peer through the partially opened door
stauffenberg hides the bombs with his body
general keitel insists that the colonel please hurry
haeften scoops the unarmed explosive into his briefcase
stauffenberg motions for haeften to leave
haeften comes out moving freyend back with his body and shutting the door behind him a charged moment
the colonel is changing major
you understand this can be difficult
freyend backs down
stauffenberg produces a pair of pliers one handle specially bent for easier use by a man with only three fingers
with some effort he manages to secure the pliers around the fuse
close on the acid capsule of the fuse
the jaws of the pliers gently squeeze crushing it
the bomb is live
there is no turning back now
stauffenberg closes his briefcase and opens the door greeted by freyend and haeften
freyend scurries trying to catch up with keitel
stauffenberg and haeften lag behind
to haeften see that the car is ready
haeften looks down at the briefcase in his hand the second unarmed explosive inside
but sir i have everything i need lieutenant
haeften reluctantly takes his leave just as freyend turns back eager for stauffenberg to pick up the pace
he reaches for the briefcase
let me help you with that
pulling it away i can manage thank you
freyend seems more than just a little peeved
but stauffenberg doesnt notice
he is focused straight ahead mentally calculating what time he has left
the bunker suddenly seems miles away
security perimeter i
keitel and his men file through the heavily guarded entrance
each man holds up his pass for the guards to inspect
stauffenberg is last
keitel heads toward a wooden structure up ahead away from the bunker
stauffenberg is confused
where are they going
its too hot
the briefing has been moved to the conference hut
angle on the conference hut
the door and many windows of the flimsy wooden structure are all open
not ideal for generating the deadly air pressure vital to stauffenbergs plan
but this obstacle only seems to strengthen his resolve
he is a soldier after all
and no military operation goes according to plan
making matters worse sir your briefcase
annoyed but not wanting to arouse suspicion stauffenberg finally acquiesces handing it over
he watches freyend carry the bomb into the hut
stauffenberg looks back over his shoulder to fellgiebel standing by the communications building
the man who will get stauffenberg out of the room before the bomb goes off
they share a nod
then stauffenberg steps into the hut
in the room beyond we see hitler at the end of a long table surrounded by ranking officers
one by one they present their individual briefings to the nodding fuhrer
stauffenberg whispers to freyend
my injuries left me a bit hard of hearing
see that you place me as near the fuhrer as possible
freyend nods but for now his concerns are elsewhere wrangling everyone into the meeting
like the other officers stauffenberg hangs up his belt and hat on hooks at the entrance to the briefing room
he catches sight of sergeant major adam the conference huts young telephone operator
im expecting an urgent call from berlin
a small room measuring by feet
we notice again that the windows are open to let in some air
hitler and his officers hunch over a long heavy table covered in detailed maps of eastern europe and the soviet union
lieutenants and sergeants continually tiptoe in and out of the room
a general stands beside hitler in the middle of his briefing the eastern front forces are assured a victory
but they need reinforcements
in other words they are getting pounded but he cant say that
the general is relived to be interrupted by keitels arrival
the briefing stops momentary as please pardon our tardiness
you remember colonel stauffenberg
hitler makes a deliberate effort to shake stauffenbergs hand their eyes lock an unnerving moment
stauffenberg has come to kill this man greeting him
the moment is broken when the general clears his throat continuing his presentation
as you can see mein fuhrer the situation in the east prussian sector is increasingly critical
and on and on
freyend startles stauffenberg slightly when he takes him by the arm moving him to his place at the table less than half a step from hitler
he is squeezed in between two other officers
we suck in wind when we see who one of them is
colonel heinz brandt the same brandt who carried the bottles of cointreau onto hitlers plane so long ago
he still scribbles in his damn datebook
freyend sets the briefcase beside stauffenberg bumping brandts leg
brandt looks down at the briefcase long enough to make us nervous
he watches as stauffenberg nonchalantly bends down sliding the briefcase as close to hitler as possible leaning it against the heavy wooden table support immediately to the right of hitlers
stauffenberg looks back at the open door glances at his watch
he can clearly see sergeant adam the telephone operator
where is his god damn phone call
around him generals talk hitler nods but we hear nothing
only the pulse of stauffenbergs heartbeat in his own ears the only thing betraying his otherwise outward calm
he looks down at the briefcase the bomb just under his feet
he looks at hitler nodding
the longer we stay the more excruciating it is
so we milk it
stauffenberg is startled when a hand touches his arm
the annoying freyend is there whispering in his ear
keitel sees this irritated by the interruption
stauffenberg makes a gesture to keitel with his hand indicating a phone call
keitel is not pleased
freyend leads stauffenberg to adam who offers the telephone receiver
general fellgiebel sir
he says its urgent
stauffenberg takes the phone and stares at freyend and adam they get the idea that this is a private call and leave
when they are gone stauffenberg simply lays the receiver down and walks out
a moment later adam returns to the room
he sees the receiver laying there
looking down the hallway he sees stauffenberg quickly exiting the building
then he notices stauffenbergs hat and belt still hanging outside the briefing room
colonel you forgot your hitler leans on his elbows carefully studying the map before him as the generals presentation drags on
brandt moves in closer filling the void left by stauffenberg
his foot hits something
he looks at stauffenbergs briefcase as it falls over
slowly brandt reaches down picking up the briefcase looking around for stauffenberg
he considers the bag for a moment and we are sure he is going to open it
but then he puts it back under the table
but now the heavy wooden support is between hitler and the bomb
and now i believe colonel stauffenberg will present us with his deployment for the replacement army should the unthinkable occur and the russians reach where is stauffenberg
keitel shoots freyend a look
freyend steps into the hall
no sign of stauffenberg
sergeant adam approaches looking confused
where the hell is stauffenberg
but adam shrugs holding out stauffenbergs hat
fellgiebel and haeften watch anxiously as stauffenberg clears the security checkpoint and walks toward them slow and deliberate eerily calm
hitler at the far end of the room bent over the conference table leaning on his elbows
a massive ear splitting explosion lifts the table up throwing hitler back and simultaneously vaporizing the men standing on either side of him
the hut explodes outward like a house of cards
bodies are thrown clear
everyone hits the deck except stauffenberg
he just keeps walking
a great cloud of smoke billows from the ruins
the sky is alive with a swirl of burnt paper scraps and ash
stunned officers are running about
even knowing it was coming haeften is stunned
stauffenberg walks up to the communications building and takes him by the arm turning to fellgiebel
contact general olbricht in berlin
tell him hitler is dead
proceed with operation valkyrie
then sever all communications
fellgiebel nods and rushes to make the call
stauffenberg leads haeften to their waiting car still driven by young lt
he too is stunned by the explosion so much so that he does not think to get out and open the door for his passengers
stauffenberg climbs in next to kretz pushing haeften in the back
to kretz drive
kretz lingers kretz snaps out of it and jams the car in gear speeding off down the forested trail
stauffenberg and haeften look back for a clear view of the total destruction
bodies are carried out of the demolished hut the grounds littered with the wounded
surly there is no way the fuhrer could have survived
fellgiebel holds a phone to his ear
i said olbricht
general olbricht at the war ministry
the call is urgent
a breathless communications officer enters pointing in mute shock to the ruin outside
what the hell just happened
what does it look like
the fuhrer is fellgiebel freezes something catching his eye
come around to his p
share his horror
through the window fellgiebel has a clear view of the conference hut or rather whats left
hitler limping dazed his clothes in tatters is being led from the smoldering ruins
he is very much alive
kretz brings the car to a sudden stop at the first checkpoint
a barricade is in place
a guard approaches
stauffenberg and haeften hold up passes
we have to get to the airfield at once
orders form the fuhrer
the guard signals his men to remove the barricade
fellgiebel waits to be connected to the war ministry in berlin
his communications officer awaits orders
this makes it hard for fellgiebel to speak plainly
he plays up his distress for his audience
i am calling from the wolfs lair with urgent news for the general
something terrible has happened
then he turns his back lowers his voice
whispering the fuhrer is still alive
please come again
but fellgiebels officer is watching him trying to hear
fellgiebel has no choice but to hang up
sever all communications
olbricht anxiously hovers over mertz who shouts into the phone
i didnt hear you
but its no use
mertz slowly hangs up the phone
well what did he say
couldnt be sure
it sounded as though he said
hitler is still alive
olbricht clinches his teeth and starts sweating
get him back on the line
the bomb did go off
that much was clear
fellgiebels next step will be to sever all communications
olbricht is confused
colonel stauffenberg was explicit
we initiate valkyrie regardless
only fromm can initiate
you know that
tell him hitlers dead
or arrest him
but do it now
but olbricht is frozen
did you hear me
you have to give the order to initiate valkyrie
this is our only im not doing anything until i talk to fellgiebel
get him back on the phone
mertz shakes his head bitterly and dials but hell never get through
stauffenbergs car presses on through the woods toward the last security checkpoint but numerous new road barriers are in place
this is not good
one sergeant kolbe and two armed soldiers step from the guardhouse signalling kretz to stop
no one gets in or out
were on orders from the fuhrer
we have to get to the airfield immediately
you will step aside
im sorry sir but my orders are stauffenberg steps out of the vehicle and makes a beeline for the guardroom
kolbe races after him
stauffenberg snatches up the telephone before kolbe and his men can stop him
get me general keitel
stauffenberg wipes a single bead of sweat from his brow
with the guards hovering over him he turns and casually sits on the desk blocking the phone with his body
he surreptitiously rests his hand on the telephone cradle hanging up
he talks to no one
i cant get past the outer gate
he looks at kolbe
sergeant kolbe says no one is getting out
maybe you can explain it to him
stauffenberg holds out the phone staring hard bluffing harder
kolbe considers the phone
finally that wont be necessary colonel
a humiliated kolbe watches stauffenbergs car speed away from the open barriers
silence but for the chattering engine
kretz is distracted by movement in the rearview mirror
in rearview mirror
haeften rummages through his briefcase removing objects kretz cant make out tossing them one by one into the woods
haeften realizes he is being watched by kretz in the mirror and shoots him a look
mind your own business
kretz returns his attention to the road
but something just isnt sitting right with him
stauffenberg and haeften climb aboard a waiting plane
a beat later it is rolling down the runway
every second we stand here arguing is a second lost
olbricht is calm in full denial
he straightens his tie in the mirror as mertz paces the room flustered
i cant initiate valkyrie without confirmation that hitlers dead
its too great a risk
what about stauffenberg
what about his risk
he did his part and now youre abandoning him
watch yourself colonel
shouldnt you be consulting beck
i know just what beck will say
hes a dying man
what does he have to lose
he puts on his hat and coat now turning to leave
at least put the reserve army on alert
i cant cover up another false alarm
when stauffenberg returns when he gives me confirmation
then well proceed
mertz is speechless
as olbricht walks out and where are you going
the same place you are
keitel sits at his desk listening intently to someone o
although his wounds are superficial he certainly took a beating in the blast
the one eyed colonel
he left the building very abruptly just before the explosion
several men left the building before the explosion
spit it out man
the colonel left his hat
keitels expression sours
is that all youve got for me
he is about to say so when that prick freyend barges in also banged up
with him is kretz stauffenbergs driver
pardon the intrusion sir but i think you will be most interested to hear what this man has to say
forty five precious minutes have slipped away
mertz sits alone at olbrichts desk lighting a fresh cigarette with the remains of another
the ashtray says hes been at this for quite a while
he stares at the clock as if attempting to will time forward
his eyes sweep across olbrichts desk past his files his stationery framed photographs of his family
then he looks up at a portrait of hitler
mertz is struck suddenly with a notion
he looks again at olbrichts desk
he grabs the stationery and feeds it into a typewriter
mertz approaches a lowly telecommunications operator
a struggle with the soul
then he hands over a sheet of paper
orders from general olbricht
again we are inside the nerve center of nazi communications
again the teletypes busily chatter away
and again sgt
helm is curious watching the teletype operator looks up at helm
what do i do
helm glances over his shoulder to the uptight lt
send it through
but keep me informed
a shrill whistle takes us to
once again reservists and cadets rush to their homes and scramble to put on their uniforms
the siren the sculpted eagle and swastika the pillared stronghold
tanks and heavy equipment are once again made ready
general hase issues the alert signal just as he did before watching the men of the reserve army scramble
in the melee we find lieutenant hagen
here we go again
he says this to
major remer the man who was so suspicious last time is even more suspicious now
a light drizzle
a man jabbering in italian o
we get our first good look at the demolished briefing hut
that anyone survived is a miracle
officers crowd around the smoldering ruins the fuhrer himself heading this procession
he wears new clothes nodding smiling politely to the jabbering italian o
a slight wince is the only indication that he was damn near blown to bits just hours ago
come around to reveal none other than benito mussolini speaking an incessant stream of italian
mussolinis blathering falls literally on deaf ears
three hours have passed since the explosion
stauffenberg and haeften alight from the plane
the airfield is surprisingly calm
no car to meet them
quiet isnt it
ill see where our driver is
haeften walks over to the office
stauffenberg looks around the airfield
the silence slowly becomes unnerving
he goes after haeften
stauffenberg enters just in time to hear you mean to tell me that the alert is only just going out stauffenberg swipes the phone from haeften
this is stauffenberg
get me general olbricht
olbricht storms in furious
he stands over mertz waving a document in his face the very same document mertz typed on olbrichts stationery
someone had to do something while you were playing dead
we dont know that the fuhrer is not alive
we dont know any before a fuming olbricht can respond the phone rings
both men look at it olbricht is afraid to answer
mertz shakes his head and picks up
general olbrichts office
he looks at olbricht grimly holding out the phone
stauffenberg for you sir
olbricht would rather take a live cobra than handle the phone right now
but take it he does
note intercut between olbricht and stauffenberg
its been three hours olbricht
what the hell have you been doing
weve had no confirmation that
dammit man i saw the explosion myself
nothing else matters now
we are committed
olbricht sits color draining from his face
a real what have i done moment
now where is fromm
is he with us or did you i no one has spoken to him yet
stauffenberg pounds his fist on the wall furious for the first and only time showing us a crack in his ultra cool exterior
he collects himself and looks at his watch
listen to me olbricht
never mind germany
never mind europe
your life is at stake now do you understand
if you want to live through the night youll do exactly as i say
the second you hang up the phone initiate operation valkyrie in fromms name
then go over to his office in force give him the choice to join us or place him under immediate arrest
do i make myself perfectly clear
i am at the airfield now
i will be in fromms office in fifteen minutes
be there when i arrive
he slams the phone down taking us to
with shaking hands olbricht moves the portrait of hitler exposing a hidden wall safe from which he removes at last a thick folder marked he looks at mertz
get beck and the others
tell them its time
relieved mertz nods and rushes out
olbricht picks up the phone and dials
after a beat he reads from the first page of the valkyrie order
this is general olbricht calling on behalf of general fromm commander of the home army
adolf hitler is dead
a group of radicals from the ss are attempting to seize control of the government
operation valkyrie is in effect
all military districts training schools and replacement troops are to take control of essential government offices at once
haans sits at his desk sensing someone over his shoulder
he turns to find sgt
helm a sheet of paper in his trembling hands
the fuhrer is dead
skeptical haans snatches the paper from helm
when he looks up the entire staff is looking at him some with tears in their eyes others perhaps hiding a sense of relief
a phone rings
the chattering teletypes seem to surge into another gear as news of hitlers death starts to spread
haans struggles with the sheer size of the moment
you all know your jobs
get to work
zombie like the operators go back to their teletypes passing orders along
but one operator the one helm asked to keep him informed notices something strange about one order in a stack of many he is sifting through
this order is signed by witzleben
taking the paper thats ridiculous
he s not even in the army anymore
but sure enough there is witzlebens name
helm looks over at the devastated haans wondering how to handle this
then like a good little nazi pass the order along
reserve soldiers are marched into readiness
vehicles moved into place
as they await further orders
who told you the fuhrer was dead
mertz and a sheepish olbricht stand before fromm
a stunned lt
herber hovers by the door
at the wolfs lair
fromm is at a loss for words
this just cant be so
he picks up the phone
this is fromm
put me through to the wolfs lair
theres no use calling all communication lines are yes
general fromm for field marshal keitel
mertz and olbricht are shocked that he got through
keitel is still nursing a few wounds
whats going on up there
the most incredible rumors are circulating in berlin
immediately suspicious keitel plays dumb leading
i dont know what you mean
everythings in order here
keitel looks out the window at the still smoldering ruins of the conference hut in the distance
theres talk the fuhrers been assassinated
another failed attempt
the fuhrer was never in danger
beat by the way where is your man colonel stauffenberg
on his way back to berlin i should think
at the very mention of his name olbricht starts squirming
let me know when he arrives
id like a word with him
after a beat fromm hangs up smug
a false alarm
the fuhrer is fine
herbers outward relief stands in sharp contrast to olbrichts barely contained dread
then thats a lie
all eyes turn to see stauffenberg and haeften appear in the doorway
mertz lets out a sigh of relief as they push their way past herber and march into the room
hitler is dead
operation valkyrie is in effect
fromm stands pounding his fist on the desk
be that as it may the reserve army is assuming control here in berlin
we trust youll join us
do you realize what youve done
the fuhrer is a i delivered the bomb myself
i saw the blast
he is dead
fromm is stunned on several levels
he slowly sits back in his chair
close on lt
herber who sees stauffenberg as the model nazi is more shocked by this than the news of hitlers death
this cant be happening
its some kind of joke
are you with us or not
colonel if what you say is true you should shoot yourself at once
to the others the rest of you are under arrest
and with those words haeften and mertz draw their pistols training them on the confused fromm
herber is paralyzed unsure of what to do
i dont know where you think this is going but i suggest you men change into civilian clothes and find a place to hide
to haeften lock him upstairs in his private quarters
make sure his phone lines are cut
stauffenberg mertz and olbricht march with great purpose
they are joined by beck coming the other way wearing a plain dark suit
it is moving to see the old man manage the long walk
youre not in uniform
this has to be seen as a movement of the people
then he takes stauffenbergs arm letting mertz and olbricht walk on lowering his voice
youre certain hes dead
stauffenberg can see the private fear in becks eyes
but before he can answer he is interrupted by a gasp o
as olbricht opens the door to his office stepping back in shock
the others turn to see what it is
looking out at the shocked faces of olbricht mertz beck and stauffenberg
pull back to reveal olbrichts office is packed to the four walls with german officers all of them standing in silence looking at the leaders of the resistance with great
stauffenberg walks in and the crowd parts solemn and silent nodding and whispering thanks
a young officer steps forward
he looks hauntingly like the lieutenant who drove stauffenberg in africa
colonel stauffenberg sir
were reporting for duty
stauffenberg is moved beyond words
suddenly what was once a small clutch of discarded generals and politicians is now a movement of motivated men
stauffenberg nods collects himself
in the crowd he finds helldorf the head of the berlin police whom we met earlier
at first he speaks quietly humbled
shaking hands helldorf im
glad to see you
were getting a late start and we need all of the manpower we can muster
can we count on the police
theres a lot of talk that hitler isnt really dead
is this true
the men in the room share nervous glances
then all eyes on stauffenberg
i cant offer you any guarantees
the decision is yours and yours alone
can we count on you
pan across the uneasy faces of the men in the room perhaps all of them waiting to see what helldorf does before making their decisions
finally im with you
stauffenberg can barely hide his relief
there is a palpable shift in the room
one by one the officers in the room reaffirm their commitment to the coup
have your men surround the building
no one gets in or out of here without my permission
to the others i want every available soldier on task we need simultaneous control of every government building in the city
the soldiers move but becks voice stops them surprisingly loud and clear for a sick old man
acts of vengeance will not be tolerated
we represent a different form of government
we represent what is good and just in germany
stauffenberg stands at his cluttered desk a flurry of activity surrounding him
he is frantically speaking into the phone and to those present
deploy troops to seize and protect all reich agencies
of most importance are communication centers newspapers radio stations telephone and telegraph offices
all nazi officials and government leaders are to be arrested at once
general hase the berlin commandant stands before a giant map of berlin addressing a roomful of nazi completely blockade the government quarters
everything from the brandenburg gate to potsdamer platz
nobody not even generals or ministers should be allowed to pass
beat you have your orders gentlemen
again we focus on major remer commander of the deutschland guard battalion and always suspicious
is there a problem major
it just all seems very
protocol dictates we should receive orders in writing these are the orders as they were presented to me major
just before the pause becomes insolent remer clicks his heels and salutes leaving
but the look on his face tells us hes hatching a plan of his own
you are right to be nervous
the city center is abuzz with soldiers and military vehicles as they frantically cordon off the streets
soldiers come out of various government buildings with several nazi generals in custody hands bound
they push them into waiting trucks
meanwhile passing civilians walk quickly by trying to pretend they dont see anything
years of nazi rule have told them to mind their own business
angle on a staff car major remer in the back watching the entire scene with cold eyes
hagen emerges from the chaos on the streets
weve just had orders from the war ministry
the battalion is to blockade the government quarter and place minister goebbels under arrest
remer does not move
he just thinks
what is it major
something just doesnt feel right about this
i would hate to find out im being taken advantage of
realizing a coup you think
of that i am certain
what i cant say is which side were on
as hagen does remer turns to his driver
take us to the reichministry
be quick about it
stauffenberg beck and olbricht lead a continued effort to manage the coup
each man shouts orders into the phone all the while signing dispatches sent by a steady flow of runners
fraulein von oven the secretary who worked with stauffenberg and tresckow to compile the valkyrie orders rushes in whispering to stauffenberg
send him in
oven hesitates its all right
send him in
she opens the door and motions to someone outside
after a beat the door is filled with an almost classic looking nazi a fat general bristling with medals
he enters the room confused when he sees olbricht at fromms desk
begging your pardon but i have orders to report to general fromm
general fromm is no longer in command
seeing beck beck
what are you what is going on here
the fuhrer is dead
the ss is staging a coup
weve initiated operation valkyrie to crush the uprising and save hitlers germany
the fat general assesses the scene with suspicion
id say there is a coup all right but its not the ss
olbricht offers a sheet of paper
you will present these orders to your troops
i will do no such thing without speaking to general fromm
i swore an oath you have your orders
join us or face the consequences
stauffenberg and olbricht take an imposing step in the fat generals direction
he carefully backs away
this is treason
i wont take part
the fuhrer is not dead
the fuhrer the fat general makes a break for it
the conspirators chase him out into
the fat general pushes past onlooking officers
but they just watch the commotion stunned
a ranking general being chased like a common criminal
haeften and mertz appear at the other end of the hall pistols raised blocking the generals path
with stauffenberg and olbricht they overpower the fat general who screams wildly to the amazement of the gawking officers
when they have him under control stauffenberg turns to the onlookers
he finds a familiar face in the crowd
a face he can trust
he finds lt
angle on lt
he reluctantly steps forward
lock him up with fromm
herber hesitantly takes hold of the general but the act of taking a general into custody is a strange one
herber is clearly conflicted
remer arrives followed by a wave of trucks
soldiers deploy surrounding the building
propaganda minister goebbels the most ghoulish of hitlers big six
his spooky deep set eyes watch the action on the street below
already he can hear troops coming down the hallway
he takes a pistol from his desk drawer and leaves it within reach
then he picks up the phone and dials
after a beat
i am ready to be connected
the sound of footsteps outside his door
it bursts open
remer enters followed by armed soldiers
what can i do for you major
minister goebbels my battalion has an order to blockade the government quarter and place you under arrest
remer sees the pistol on goebbels desk
but goebbels makes no attempt to grab for it
instead are you a dedicated nazi major
remer is caught off guard
with that goebbels turns his attention to the phone in his hand
we hear a faint voice hello
with an eerie smile goebbels simply extends his arm offering the phone to a confused remer
silence as the major takes it holding it to his ear
do you recognize my voice
remer is in awe for a moment unable to speak
then of course mein fuhrer
then listen to me very carefully
the communications staff busily connects calls and transmits orders
helm gingerly approaches lt
haans with two sheets of paper
what is it now sergeant
its just that now were getting conflicting orders sir
the wolfs lair says one thing stauffenberg another
haans sighs genuinely irritated now
our job is not to interpret the orders
our job is to pass them along
yes but sir is that perfectly clear sergeant
haans thrusts the orders back at helm who sheepishly walks back to his pool of radio operators
as day turns to night the soldiers surrounding the government quarters wait for further orders
major remer comes out a new man invigorated and focused
he walks over to a truck loaded with ranking prisoners turning to the soldiers guarding them
re prisoners release these men at once
but these men are part of a coup
ive just been on the phone with hitler himself
we are the coup you idiot
weve been duped
fromm is a prisoner in his own quarters staring at a portrait of hitler with equal parts disdain and reverence
the door suddenly opens
herber enters leading the handcuffed fat general
avoiding fromms gaze he removes the restraints and turns to leave
but the wily fromm can see the look in herbers eyes
what do you make of all of this
i dont know
i wont ask you to make a choice
thats for you and you alone
all i ask is that you observe and think for yourself
in time youll see things for what they truly are
you know where to find me when you do
herber nods hesitantly then turns to leave but lieutenant
as herber turns back heil hitler
herber raises his right arm just managing heil hitler
goebbels office is now the scene of great activity
soldiers rush in and out carrying orders
goebbels is on two phones at the same time
through the melee comes none other than heinrich himmler the bespectacled villain whose appearance is unmatched in fiction
his arrival cannot be good
have you seen the fuhrer
is he it seems the conference table shielded him from the blast
hes lucky to be alive
looking around do you want to tell me whats going on
everything is under control
ive taken charge of the guard battalion and given them new orders
were turning the tables on these cowards
ive been sent here personally by the fuhrer to collect the conspirators
he insists they be taken alive
goebbels and himmler two of the most evil men who ever lived smile coldly
being taken alive by this mob is obviously a fate worse than death
goebbels turns to a nearby aide
take this down
by order of adolf hitler
once again the operators are frozen looking at lt
he in turn looks at two orders in his hands
he is deeply confused
helm is not
its a coup all right
and when its over wed better wind up on the right side
now we cant afford to remain neutral any longer
we have to make a decision
close on haans
all eyes watch him weigh the decision of his life of many lives
millions in fact
finally he relents handing one paper to helm
send all communications from the wolfs lair
stop all communications from stauffenberg
the operators spring into action
today an attempt was made on the fuhrers life
stauffenberg works frantically in a room full of officers the energy here being the antithesis of goebbels office the morale quickly waning
he ignores the radio writing orders making phone calls fighting to keep the coup alive
but we know now his orders are hitting a dead end
the fuhrer himself suffered no major injuries and resumed his work immediately
stauffenberg turns off the radio grabbing haeften just as he is coming in
send the following teleprint to all army commanders
broadcast communique not correct
the fuhrer is dead
orders to be carried out with utmost dispatch
haeften nods and leaves
stauffenberg turns back to his work coming face to face with a deeply troubled beck
stauffenberg whispers frustrated
i saw the blast
what the hell kind of coup is this
all eyes turn to find witzleben
hours ago he was a civilian now he is a pompous know it all general
the military districts are receiving contradictory reports
ive got men sitting around joking about whose turn it is to arrest whom
neither the capital nor the radio network are under our control
and where are the troops
youd think there would be some activity going on in this city
to stauffenberg the word is all over the street that hitler is still alive
we trusted you and you failed us
you should have stayed
to be sure
and who would have led the men here in berlin
finding his balls olbricht confronts witzleben
the colonel did more than any man could have hoped
if anyone is to blame its field marshal witzleben is right
i am the officer in charge
i am the man responsible
no one else
olbricht is moved and rightly so
meanwhile im going home to await my inevitable arrest
witzleben turns marching out
the room remains ill at ease everyone having just witnessed a serious blow to the resistance
those anonymous soldiers present exchange glances of concern
im sorry colonel
after a beat olbricht turns and leaves
close on lieutenant herber tucked away in a corner of the office
he looks at stauffenberg in a new light now something darker no longer the admirer
he shares a look with two other officers
a wordless understanding
he leaves and they follow
herber and company march down the hallway in silence
they stop for herber to unlock the door to
the officers file in making a beeline for a locker in the corner of the room
inside are all manner of sub machine guns pistols grenades
under remers direction the deutschland guard battalion quickly surrounds the war ministry
we see a figure moving behind the windows up above
olbricht helplessly watches troops surround the building below
it is only a matter of time now
he sits at his desk
with a long trembling sigh he puts pen to paper and writes my dearest wife
a commotion from the anteroom startles olbricht and he drops the pen
a loud shrill scream follows
the door bursts open to reveal herber and his two cohorts
they are supported by a half dozen armed soldiers all training their weapons on olbricht
in the anteroom behind the soldiers we see fraulein oven quietly slipping out into the hallway
beck stauffenberg and haeften are still making calls and writing orders doing all they can to keep the coup alive
they are startled when fraulein oven bursts in
it is written on her face
stauffenberg and haeften rush toward olbrichts office stopping when they see a mass of soldiers surrounding the doorway
a chill runs down our spines when we see herber talking to none other than major remer
just then he spots stauffenberg and haeften
stauffenberg and haeften turn and run
a shot is fired
stauffenberg and haeften take cover in a nearby doorway
haeften returns fire
stauffenberg clamps his pistol under the stump of his right arm managing to cock it with the three fingers of his left hand
then he aims and fires
stauffenberg takes a bullet in the shoulder of his good arm
he drops his gun bleeding badly
but more soldiers appear at the opposite end of the corridor
the loyal haeften covers stauffenberg with his body aiming to fire
but stauffenberg stops him shaking his head
they toss down their guns
boot steps approach loudly o
as stauffenberg looks down at the cross and ring around his neck thank you colonel
stauffenberg is genuinely confused
better i die for germany than for hitler
stauffenberg turns to find remer standing there
youre under arrest
stauffenberg olbricht beck mertz and haeften the last of the conspiracy are held at gunpoint
a smug fromm enters followed by herber the fat general remer and numerous gun toting officers
if you have any last messages youd better write them now
my actions speak for me
to his men id rather my wife and children remember our last time together
the others bravely nod in agreement
but then id like a pistol please
stauffenberg looks at beck with surprise
for personal reasons
fromm thinks about it then matter of factly hands beck a pistol
remer quickly steps forward
general my orders are to deliver the prisoners alive
to beck get on with it then
fromm glares at remer who angrily backs down
then he turns to beck and with a casual wave of the hand continue
the moment is surreal
beck seated at the desk looks at each of his fellow conspirators
a look of thanks goodbye
with a badly trembling hand he places the gun to his temple
im thinking of earlier times
close on the conspirators turn away unable to watch
and as if none of the last minute has even occurred fromm turns to the other conspirators
very well then
a court martial convened by me in the fuhrers absence has pronounced sentence colonel mertz von quernheim general olbricht lieutenant haeften
glaring at stauffenberg and the colonel whose name i will not mention are condemned to death
to his men take them outside
remer is clearly upset by this
herber on the other hand seems clearer than ever
he nods to his men who drag the conspirators out
herber personally takes stauffenberg by the arm
the two men share a look
nothing needs to be said
each has found his place
stauffenberg turns to confront fromm
he is weak white from fatigue and loss of blood
the fuhrer will want to put us on trial make an example of us
this wont win you any favor
and it wont hide youre involvement
i dont know what you
you knew and you did nothing
youre just as guilty as we are
even more so
spare me stauffenberg
and those words bring a genuine smile to stauffenbergs face
he almost pities fromm now
no one will be spared
and as fromm motions for herber to take stauffenberg away we hear music faintly at first accompanied by the subtle hiss and crackles of a phonograph
it is the piece stauffenberg and nina were dancing to one night long ago
over this a voice
a man speaking in german faint at first crackling over the radio
once again i dont know how many times it has been now an attempt has been made on my life
a series of images of the coup being reversed as the nazis take back power made all the more poignant by the lonely sound of the phonograph the music slowly
rising growing clearer and eventually becoming score over the silent images of conspirators being rounded up and arrested
among them are faces we recognize
goerdeler dragged from a hotel bed by ss officers as his informing innkeeper watches from the doorway
witzleben is led in handcuffs from his home where he has been awaiting his fate
military vehicles are hastily arranged in a semi circle headlamps marking the scene in stark white light and long black shadows
stauffenberg haeften olbricht and mertz are marched into the courtyard squinting in the harsh light as they are placed against the wall of the war ministry
i speak to you tonight for two reasons
first so that you can hear my voice and know that i am unhurt
and second so that you may know the details of a crime without parallel in german history
fellgiebel is swarmed by ss in his office at the wolfs lair and summarily beaten
chief of police helldorf is caught by surprise as his own men burst into his office rifles raised
ten soldiers of the deutschland guard battalion scramble to form a line opposite stauffenberg and his conspirators
we can clearly read fromms lips shouting make ready
stauffenberg and haeften share a reassuring smile
remer watches bitterly from the shadows focusing his hatred not on the conspirators
but on fromm
berthold stauffenbergs brother is taken from his flat in berlin
fromm smiles to himself satisfied
a small clique of ambitious dishonorable stupid officers have conspired to eliminate me
except for a few bruises and burns i was completely untouched
fromm raises his arm his lips reading take aim
stauffenberg takes a breath and shouts defiantly his lips reading long live sacred german fromm drops his hand
ten rifles open fire
crane up and away as the music swells as what is left of berlin comes into view as the few lights that remain suddenly go out as if a dark
shadow were passing over the land
i see in this the hand of providence
directing me to complete my work
and the last strains of music resolve in a single sustained note as we crane up further looking at last to the overcast darkness of the night sky
the last note goes on as if it might play forever
until suddenly it dips and we realize we are no longer hearing music at all but the urgent wailing of an air raid siren the warning of allied bombers coming
to deliver their nightly assault on berlin
hitlers gift to germany
