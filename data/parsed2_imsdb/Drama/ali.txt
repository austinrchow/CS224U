written by stephen j rivele christopher wilkinson eric roth michael mann story by gregory allen howard in the dark
coming toward us
up and down in sync to an instrumental lead in from somewhere
a slip of light
a glimpse of somebody in shadow under a sweatshirt hood staring at us in and out of the dark as
a man walks into the shot grabs a microphone slips out of his jacket and looks at us
he wants to tell us something
hes in a lavender light
this is sam cooke
what he calls out
a throaty mixture of gospel soul and sex
is let me hear it
and women shriek
he says yeah
they answer shrieking oh yeah
up and down running along a dark road in the dead of night passing vacant lots with debris amid trees and faded buildings
he is cassius clay
he runs in construction boots
his eyes stare from under the hood
he passes the husk of an abandoned car a pastel storefront
were in overtown miamis inner city black neighborhood
shouts dont fight it
we gonna feel it
the women in the audience answer gotta feel it
now runs diagonally across nw th intercut with cooke shouting yeah
cassius runs toward us
off to the side in the black mirrored water of biscayne bay leaden clouds in a black sky
and now sam cooke sings
because you make me wanna mooove
and breaks into the first verse of feel it
but we see cassius eyes are focused concentrated elsewhere
to where is this man running
why is his expression so distant
a white light suddenly hits him from behind
he looks over at
thats slowed clocking the suspicious running black man
the driver starts to pull over to hassle cassius
then the cop riding shotgun gets a radio call
he taps the drivers shoulder
they take off the driver laughing
cassius looks after the white cops
he is neither relieved nor angry
and instead he sees something else
and six other patrician white business people of louisville in their green baize and wood paneled luxo boardroom
they speak soundlessly and patronizingly to cassius clay sr
seated at the foot of the table
it relates to the stack of contracts in front of him
he is in a suit and tie his hair and moustache are dapper
his ties a little loud
he has his hands folded deferentially in front of him
the successor trustee shall be fully authorized to pay or disperse such sums from the income or principal as may be required
beat do you understand so far mr
uh yes i do
we get the impression that if he doesnt understand what hes being told hes faking it
he is conforming delivering socially mandated deference
and beyond him seated against the wall is cassius jr
in sport jacket and tie
right now he looks to his left and to the right and only then do we notice the entire wall hes against is covered with pictures of thoroughbreds and studs
this louisville sponsoring group owns as well
he is one among their sporting possessions
he doesnt like it
he looks at the back of his father listening
are you sure sir
i follow you
cause id be happy to explain any of these terms
no thank you
thank you sir
back here now crossing through black night and over black water of the macarthur causeway
we start to hear pop pop pop pop pop pop pop over sam cookes music and sam cookes image superimposes as he segues from feelin to bring it on home
and the pop pop pop pop pop carries us into
cassius fists fly in a reeling motion hitting the speed bag
but its his eyes that arrest us
is a blur
and it slows and becomes a brown boxing glove driving in a slowed straight line right at us like a piston
over the glove pushing the fist at us is sonny liston
the brown glove hits
in a linear left jab
these punches are watched by cassius eyes in the fifth street gym
studiously studying listons feet
straight line movement
the jab linear and straight at us
but it slams into the boxer not cassius
down he goes
the referee pulls out his mouthpiece
its a bloody mess
teeth have been knocked out with it so devastating is sonny liston
a distant crowd roars
very close climbs into the crush with other contenders
victorious liston being escorted out passes very close to him on purpose to say
whispers low gonna fuck you up
gonna beat you like is your daddy
to cassius boxing is dangerous athletics but listons malevolence is straight from the street
hes painting a mural
its the face of white jesus with blue eyes and blonde hair
s eyes painting
eyes of year old cassius jr
watching white jesus go up on the negro baptist church in louisville become
the back of his own head moving through a tunnel of white faces holding his mothers hand passing the balloon faces of nice white passengers teenagers in athletic sweaters going
to high school some children all seated
moving through to the rear of the bus where standing are black women heavyset with heavy legs and middle aged black men with large rough hands crowded on their way
to the days labor or domestic jobs in the back of the bus
at a newspaper being refolded by one man in front of his face
published nationwide it shows his gouged out eye the barbed wire noose around his neck the mutilation to his face because at years old he winked at a white girl
is frozen by the image
it will haunt him for most of his life
the man holding the paper sees the boys fear and pushes the paper out at him as a rough joke
then the man rises and offers his seat to odessa
then someone shouts
past him a short man in a white shirt angelo dundee has entered with a folded newspaper under his arm
and cassius elsewhere slams the speed bag with a right hook and the bag becomes
in black glasses leaning against a wall
and those of you who think you came here to hear us tell you like these negro leaders do that times will get better and we shall overcome someday i
tell you you came to the wrong place
malcolm x is at the podium
we could be in tripoli
cause your times will never get better until yo make them better
and any of you who think you came here to hear us tell you to turn the other cheek to the brutality of the white man and the established system
of injustice in this country to beg for your place at their lunch counter i say again
you came to the wrong place
and cassius is there in a black shirt standing in the back
malcolm x sees him nods
the casualness attests their familiarity is close and extensive
beat cause we dont teach you to turn the other cheek
we dont teach you to turn the other cheek in the south
we dont teach you to turn the other cheek in the north
the honorable elijah muhammad teaches you instead to obey the law
to carry yourselves in a respectable way
and a proud afro american way
but at the same time
we teach you
that anyone who puts his hand on you
do your best
to see he doesnt put his hand on any
as first rays of golden light illuminate the jump rope spinning effortlessly over his head in a blur
dust dances in light through the two dirty windows with boxing gloves and fifth street gym painted on them
its that time of day jack johnson called the fighters hour
between the night and the light
and angelo dundee puts on a pot of coffee
he washes his hands in a dirty sink thoroughly drying them
alert and clean hes old school
he goes back to the edge of the ring reading his newspaper
now crossing past the white windows is drew bundini brown
he takes an orange out of his pocket sitting on a bench silently peels it
as cassius walks the rope jumping up and back
approving past newspaper yeah
like that daddy
dont jump in one place
bad for the heart
thats the most important thing
without looking cassius drops the rope where he stands and walks off as sam cooke
segues into bring it on home and women in the front row reach out for him
the heat between cooke and them is palpable
the first row is going crazy as
sits into our frame glistening with sweat directed through tortuous calisthenics by the hands of luis sarria
the place is rocking as
but cassius never throws a punch
he jerks back sliding away an inch away from being hit
he circles in a movement that seems off balance and then becomes fluid and changes rate faking out where you think hell be
his sparring partner throws a jab that misses and
follows with a hook
cassius slips it by an inch
entering the gym now is gregarious dr
ferdie pacheco with a young afrod howard bingham who starts photographing while luis sarria looks at us
none of the gathered crowd the greatest corner in boxing breaks his concentration
hes in his zone
were in the ring
cassius trance like hands down circles and slips in no predictable way as
zenned out in slo mo on the way somewhere in a suit and tie
people on the miami streets drift by
the slow moving limo floats on its soft suspension through the pastel heat of miami
while sam cooke
drives to the big climax of bring it on home to me
counter to the limos extreme calm as sam cookes medley ends and
in a terry cloth robe walks faster and faster as dundee and bundini bingham and his cameras pacheco and rudy race to keep up
and as cassius slams through a door into a large room
shout float like a butterfly
sting like a bee
rumble young man rumble
sonny liston you aint no champ
you a chump
beat you want to lose your money bet on sonny
he know im great
he will go in eight
press promoters and boxing people turn and stare
what you lookin at you ugly bear
liston a tree trunk in boxing shorts cant wait to pull apart this kid
i whup you right here
cassius pushes past people and leaps at sonny
he wants to rumble right now
bundini rudy dundee listons handlers struggle to keep them apart wrestle cassius onto the scale
cassius clay weighs pounds
changes down you sure you got that right
the man nods
cassius gets off is pulled aside
and liston gets on unremitting stare of death at cassius
the heavyweight champion of the world weighs pounds
pounds of what
and cassius goes off again
pounds of ugly
he so ugly sweat run backwards off his forehead to get away from his face
i turn you into a rug
rumble right now man
hes restrained by angelo and bundini
low keep talkin punk ass faggot
ill fuck you up like is your daddy
handlers break it up and hustle liston out of there
you whup me ill crawl out of the ring on my knees and catch the next jet plane out of the country
older reporter that a promise
to jimmy cannon you be the first eatin his words
a doctor claps a cuff around cassius arm taking blood pressure
alarmed to pacheco over
i cant let him in the ring in this condition
shout liston says hell talk with his fists
lip from louisville
laughter odds against you
big bets whether hell knock you out in the first round or third round or kill you altogether
you scared of him
im scared of no man
i give sonny liston talking lessons boxing lessons and falling down lessons
are you a black muslim
pat putnam in the miami herald said
black muslim s a press word
dundees defensive fast
mans religions his own business
what kinda questions that
does he hate white people
malcolm x was in town
then he left
was that so he wouldnt embarrass you
liston cannot stand you
cannot stand you cassius
he really wants to kill you
howard cosell is balding tall forties lugging a tape recorder
howard cosell you are an instigator
cosell smiles how you get that way
when im done with liston im comin for you
dundee uses that to end the conference before it strays into black muslim territory
meanwhile on the way out
to pacheco it doesnt come down i cancel this fight
you call me in an hour with his blood pressure
past guards bundini press starts to enter
inside clays on the sofa in his underwear watching the man with the x ray eyes who has the power to imbue and control from beams emitted from his eyes
dundee and bingham hang out
cassius mind is elsewhere
his eyes float to the corner of the doorway before we see pacheco even though from the outside has started to enter
cassius is asleep in a lounge chair
incongruously a tv is run from the house by an extension cord
his eyes say who are you
entering im called bundini rhymes with houdini
he was a jew too
some other people call me fastblack
or daddy mac
drew bundini brown early forties holds a hat in his hand his eyes always seem to be glistening ready to rage laugh or cry tentatively approaches
cassius flat eyes return to the television
motions at lounge chair shorty sent me to sugar ray robinson
i gave my power to sugar ray for seven years gave him my voodoo my magic
now shorty sent me to you
i call him shorty cause he like em circumcised
and i was a babe in a basket too
i was born on a doorstep with a note cross my chest that read do the best you can for him world
i had to suck the first nipple come along
i didnt run away from home
i been runnin to home
cassius should kick him out but bundinis got his foot in the door of cassius attention
beat and his raison detre now i gotta ask you
you fixin them fights
else no way you could tell great archie moore what round you droppin him in
all of them predictions you make comin true
never heard of nobody predictin the round like you
you either a phony or shortys in your corner
tell me the truth young man
cassius stretched out mumbles without looking at him
i study every fight
til i got a plan
wear him down two through four
drop him in the fifth round
so the pdiction aint a pdiction
its a plan
and cause of all the poppin off i do i know i gotta win
thats the truth
and why im tellin you
cause im gonna be your inspiration
in your corner
can i be in your corner young man
thinks then yeah
inexplicably moved covers aint spent much time in miami
where the water
cassius has drifted off back to watching tv
what he sees as his eyes close is the blur of pacheco taking his blood pressure
now cassius looks and his shaman bundini enters
re his blood pressure you should be asleep
the weigh in episode was an act
we take a different measure of this man
pacheco sits next to cassius and eats some of his potato chips
cassius shirt is off sitting on a bench in the dressing room
the ritualistic tradition having his hands taped
dundee expertly does it
in the background bundini pacheco bingham rudy and two men in dark suits someone from listons camp and a state boxing inspector watch
then the door opens for malcolm x in a dark suit thin tie
cassius lights up
dundee is done
the boxing inspector signs the tape
then dundee puts on gloves and laces them while
when you get back
im front row seat
im gonna find mom and dad
you could have stayed
nobody gotta hide when they with me
nothing wrong with being cool my brother
you been working toward this moment for four years
while tying hes right
dundee turns away to tear two strips of tape while cassius and malcolm face into a corner
sarria throws a towel over cassius shoulders
arms bent head down a true believer he silently stands in prayer bowing to the east with malcolm
during this dundee starts collecting his cut gear on table
its a crusade in modern times
and television is beaming if off telstar to the whole world
so allah has brought this about for a reason
time to leave salaam alaikum my brother
and as he goes leaving us not cassius incomplete cassius returns to dundee who ties gloves and puts tape over the knot
the inspector signs that too
a door slams open
cassius comes along the hallway his entourage surrounding him
three large middle aged white officials accompany him too
his face is set in stone
white towels are draped over his head onto his shoulders
bundini chirps in his ear
dundee like a plumber carrying the tools of his trade
a bucket his swabs and vaseline
and they seem distant to cassius
they reach the end of the corridor and against the wall stand three or four older bad cigar guys
the sounds from the arena drift into the hallway
cassius is on his toes now dancing dancing
and as if being drawn by a force we cant see he just goes
his entourage as if holding on carried along by him
he comes into the hall
there are shouts some scattered applause some booing growing and the sound moves through the arena
the sounds of expectations ridicule potential
but past the faces and the press whats arrested cassius attention and makes him oblivious in his solitude to all else is the bright by foot place he wants to
be most in all the world the ring
is struck by the brilliance
illuminated ready to go
counter to an expectation of anxiety cassius cant wait to get this on
other sounds happen
irrelevant to him
and now the distant sound of liston coming into the ring
his bulked up presence the roar he inspires somewhere over there
and all of a sudden cassius turns to face the angry man who wishes him death
cassius rocks left and right like a tough kid on a corner ready to rumble
the hysteria act is gone so is the boasting
instead there is only cassius stare
the effect is enigmatic what is going on here
a referee like a distant bird says something we dont hear
in the corner his feet float waiting
theres the bell for round one
right away throws a left that misses and attacks cassius throwing seven more that cassius with extreme awkward caution evades
he is fearful of the monster whose punches he has yet to feel
nevertheless he does his job measure listons range and speed
then a body shot catches him above the heart
cassius feels the real power of liston
it could stop your hearts beating
throws his long left jab
it keeps liston at a set distance
he has listons range now and he dances away from listons charges
then halfway through the round cassius eyes have hunted out an opportunity and he throws his first combination with a few hard shots that to listons surprise rock listons head
and then cassius easily evades
furious big misses to the left and right
keeps tagging liston with his long left
and now infuriates liston even more by merely walking away from listons big misses provoking even wilder and more inaccurate liston assaults
were aware that any liston shot could knock out cassius if it connected
then cassius soaks up a couple of body shots most flicks his jab slides dances clinches circles away
cassius launches a second combination slams a couple of big lefts listons way that rock his head back two times
listons so furious he flips charging cassius who hits and ducks at the same time
the bell rings three times before they stop
cassius says something we cant hear
he was supposed to kill me
well im still alive
angelo is talking to clay a mile a minute while clay mugs an open mouth
to the press ridiculing their accusation he was all talk
its clear he controlled round one to everyones surprise
we see press with typewriters ribbon microphones note pads massive tv cameras hang on platforms over two of the corners
its a desultory lower key version of round one
coverage segues to liston who throws and misses a few lefts
cassius tags him with a few rights
literally ambles into the corner
listons getting a lot of strident advice
comes in like a freight train
cassius merely leans away to avoid liston circles and now snaps off a flurry and opens a cut under sonnys left eye
then he splits out of there
at ringside on radio hes opened a cut on liston
listons never been cut
and cassius seizing opportunity hits liston with more combinations
if cassius won round one probably but not certainly won round two he now demonstrates he owns round three
its a symphony of classical cassius clay footwork flicked jabs that confuse and then hard hitting combinations that rock the presumably immovable liston
no one told sonny that cassius could hit
and at pounds he hits hard
liston angered panicked knows hes losing and goes after cassius and misses wildly as the bell ends round three
stands a moment before he sits
breathing heavily ignoring the stool and dundee and bundini looks around
this is what its like to be to be own the world
he looks over the crowd
only then turns and sits
to dundee hes nothin to me
the genius of cassius
and he knows it
slips a vial of some medicant from his pocket and rubs it into listons shoulder
the bell rings
clay peppers liston with jabs
liston pokes his left at cassius trying to reach him
liston gets his left into cassius face
its more a poke than a shot
blinks back something
were not sure what
it seems to go away
then its back
the fight continues
this time cassius violently blinks his eyes
a knife like pain
he cant see
hes getting beaten up
hes in trouble
shouting my eyes
i cant see
somethin in my eyes
dundee feverishly washes water to get the irritant out of cassius eyes
a buzzer sounds warning the bells coming for round five
now cassius stands saying
his gloves cut em off
dundees still in the ring
you quit its over
get out there
be a yardstick
this is the big one daddy
get out there and run
he literally pushes cassius into the ring
he knows this is his chance
cassius tries to tie liston up by holding onto the back of his neck but
liston pounds left and right hooks
if anybody wondered if clay could take punishment this answers that
wham wham wham wham wham
five huge hooks
liston is desperate to end it while cassius is in trouble
haymaker after haymaker some connect others are blocked but knock clay sideways
clay still blind keeps backing and dancing
with a minute left now he sees better
liston throws him into a corner still trying to put him away
but he cant and listons energy seems to deflate once he knows that
eyes are clear
in seconds he recovers his energy
cant wait to get out
he fires combinations
in the early rounds provoked by cassius listons anger caused him to abandon his fight plan
now having been proven futile listons confidence is gone
hes left with nothing
psychologically and athletically liston is defeated
listons eyes contemplate the inevitable face nine more rounds of this
waits for the seventh round bell
doing color radio commentary with les kelters blow by blow clay a round ago looked like hed about had it but in round six
then cassius knowing before anybody else suddenly rises as if on wings
both arms are in the air
followed by a roar from the crowd
realizing screaming sonny liston is not coming out
wait a minute
wait a minute
sonny liston is not coming out
and we can see liston still sitting on his stool in his corner spitting out his mouthpiece
and the new heavyweight champion of the world is cassius clay
cassius jumps onto the ropes in the corner rails the crowd i upset the world
i am the greatest
i am the greatest
all hell breaks loose
to press eat your words
eat your words
howard cosell the first to climb into the ring is on him
what made him so easy for you
i told you
didnt i tell you
bundini gives him a comb
cassius combing his hair
was there any single point you knew you had him
and he sees malcolm leaving his seat
they look at each other
malcolms huge smile
i had him in the first round
cause im the greatest
and seeing at ringside calling him up sam
let him up
and sam cooke climbs into the ring
i am the greatest
and he the greatest rock n roll singer
i want everybody to bear witness
they embrace i shook up the world
dont have a mark on me
i was burning
i was blind
im the prettiest thing that ever lived
i shook up the world
i shook up the world
as sam cooke embraces cassius
a small older man with fine features elijah muhammad the messenger sits on plastic covered furniture in his expensive living room
with him is an expressionless man who literally never smiles in a tailored dark suit
hes joseph x
as elijah muhammad the head of the nation of islam contemplates cassius victory like everyone else in america hes surprised
gordon davidson is from the louisville sponsoring group standing in the chaos with another partner and odessa and cassius sr
i dont care what should have been ordered
we need a victory party right now
pause i got national press the family the champ all kinds of folks
singing feel it
its packed with elated people
outside celebrations spill out onto the streets
through the club with lots of partygoers picks up chesterfields from the cigarette girl and goes out by pool around which we see women at tables in cocktail dresses and
good looking men
most of the rooms doors are wide open couples drinking celebrating
radios playing out into the floridian night
and others of the louisville sponsoring group in a crowd of predominantly white people drinking free drinks at the hastily arranged victory party wait
jimmy cannon red smith
they all wait
no sign of cassius
wheres your boy
a young new york times sportswriter robert lipsyte is there as well
he looks like he doesnt belong
his clothes are only perfunctorily conventional and hes a generation younger
enters and closes the door and greets malcolm x in a white shirt no tie and cassius eating ice cream in a pool of light from the tv
malcolms wife betty shabazz comes out of the kitchenette
a little girl runs from the bathroom back to cassius
the girl plops into his lap with much familiarity so we understand cassius is family and has been for a while
hes not at the fontainebleau or the roney plaza
it says cassius sense of himself is more about whats next than what he did tonight
whys he so scared
man look at that guy run
cassius feeds the girl some ice cream
i cant get away from the mummy
yeah but that mummy too slow to catch anybody
the mummy always gets his man
no he dont
to kid now dont believe that stuff on television
laughter from the outside
hes not drawn to all the partying
malcolm takes a picture with his contax
through the door enters jim brown
jim embraces malcolm and betty sam cooke and congratulates the new champ and helps himself to food
the rooms near dark
soft sounds from outside
a snatch of music
malcolms children are asleep on a cot
and we see cassius has fallen asleep on the sofa
a bedsheet is over him
malcolm and betty sitting at the table in the kitchenette quietly talking
an intimate laugh
and as cassius the new heavyweight champion of the world spends the first night of his reign asleep at home with this family
suddenly were in harlem
the streets are jammed
making them crazy causing a riot coming down the sidewalk looking like a rock and roll star in a black leather jacket is cassius clay and in an overcoat and
hat malcolm x
they own this day on th street
people are their army
the sea of people press close to their heroes
reaching out to touch the champ share a joke laugh
a girl runs up to hug cassius and runs off
we catch a glimpse on the periphery of joseph x
seven or eight reporters black and white and still photographers and bingham half with cassius half photographer in privileged position
the people look to you
do you plan on being a peoples champ like joe louis
i going to be a peoples champ
beat but not like joe louis exactly
and cassius drops it on them
and im not clay
clays the name of the people who owned by ancestors
i dont want to be called after that slave name no more
so im x
and im a member of the nation of islam
the honorable elijah muhammad is my spiritual guide
malcolm x is my mentor
this is hard news
all at once you a card carrying member
arent black muslims a hate group
droll card carrying
dont need no card
you got a christian card
million people believe in islam
im one of them
what about the reports of a split between you and elijah muhammad
joseph x we read his face listening to malcolm
this is the champs time
and im here as a friend to celebrate his victory
so i got nothing you want
im going to be a peoples champion
but i dont have to be the way you want me to be
im gonna be what i want
and im free to think any way i want
and as he goes on the crowd knows neither cassius nor malcolm will ever turn their backs on them
enters into the street with his bodyguard and looks up to a top floor window in which he sees a light is still on at a
asleep with the television on
theres a knock on the door
barely awake he gets up to answer it
still in his familiar hat and overcoat
he hasnt slept
i was leaving saw the light on
how come youre up
mumbles half asleep watchin a show on termites
they knockin down this house here
he goes back to lay on the bed
malcolm looks out the window
the wet streets at night
i been invited to speak at ibadan university in nigeria
cmon with me
six million in your house and you dont know it
you been there
yeah man lets go
nkrumah stayed with me when he was a student in new york so well stop in ghana
when we leaving
he fingers his glasses
sees what is it
you ever been so angry
have you ever been so angry that youd explode
after a beat tore out a picture of emmett till when i was little
couldnt take my eyes to it
couldnt look at it
barb wire around his neck to a pound cotton gin fan
took out his eye
the cruelty to it
i couldnt look at it
couldnt throw it away
i thought what i do wrong to be so low that people could do that to people like me
it made me feel ashamed
and that makes no sense
but thats what it was
when i heard about the four girls bombed in the th street church in birmingham
beat the prohibitions of the honorable elijah muhammad prevented me from speaking my voice in action
because birmingham was part of the civil rights movement begging for a place at the white mans table
but dead children
are dead children
so the anger i felt i had to contain
i locked that down
so tight my muscles seized
i lost control over the right side of my body
leg didnt work
right arm didnt work
im having a stroke i thought
i had to hold it in cause i wanted all i wanted was to break something
break a part
any part of this system
because you are so provoked as a human being
in your spirit
in your heart
at the death of children
but i could do
cassius is quiet
putting his glasses back on everyone knows
now im advocating more direct political action involvement with the international struggle
so elijah muhammad has suspended me as a minister in the nation of islam for days
you can fix that
i dont know
i will try when we get back
until then i will live each day as if i am already dead
that statement surprises cassius but he says nothing
malcolm x stands by the window and watches the day begin in harlem
approaches cassius in a suit and tie and beckons him into a living room in which sits elijah muhammad on a plastic covered white sofa
cassius is at his most deferential awed at being in this mans presence
elijahs power is the inverse of his size
hes short and delicate featured
he motions for cassius to sit beside him
joseph x sits across the room with two men
only after long service and high merit in the spiritual and physical rebirth of afro american people
is one granted an original name
but you are special
a world champion
so there is a gift i wish to give you
from this day forward you will be known as muhammad ali
which means one worthy of praise and ali means most high
a beat sounding it muhammad ali
humble worthy of praise
and hes genuinely moved
as elijah muhammad puts his small hands in muhammad alis hands
giving him his blessings
cautioning be very careful what you say
your words reflect on the nation of islam now
after a beat up until now i have entrusted your spiritual development to brother malcolm
beat i do not feel this is a wise course anymore
extremely emotional about malcolm tears come to elijah muhammads eyes
joseph x observes in the background
cassius is taken by surprise at the messenger s display
malcolm has gone off into the secular world and does not measure his words
i have decided to give you as your guide my very own son herbert muhammad
and he looks across the room
a roly poly man wearing a bow tie
he has a habit of nervously straightening his shirt
a seemingly mild pleasant man he is without self definition
below this avuncular surface he defines himself by quietly desiring and acquiring what is others
herbert will supervise all of your spiritual and material needs
not a thought this is a great honor messenger
elijah gives a subtle look and herbert retreats to where he came from sitting back on the couch by joseph x
weve entered mid scene
why you want to change
to ali could we get a picture with you
to cassius sr
you mind mr
a neighboring family coming to stand beside ali
cassius clay sr
a sport a flamboyant man is impatient
inside odessa clay and brother rudy are talking
whats wrong with the lawyers and managers you got
click thank you
i got you the best white men i could find
right here in lville
when the contract run out
i want black lawyers and managers
chauncey eskridge on north la salle street
angrily they saved you from the gangsters from the jackals and the hyenas of boxing
never cheated you
protected you with a trust fund
i dont need no protectin from myself
why i need protecting from myself by them
and now i got to go tell them piss off
cassius dont want you around no more

howard bingham and alis brother rudy are across the aisle from him asleep
the plane bumps in choppy air
muhammad unable to sleep a nervous flyer gets up
he wanders up the aisle to the front of the plane
a stewardess comes out of the cockpit
muhammad slows startled by the pilots

its a monumental expression of the force for the independence of black africa
accra is a wonder to ali
a third world showplace in ghana is alive with the optimism of emerging africa
and real estate are well managed
under nkrumah the city is in a frenzy of building public housing
in the three car caravan passes the huge triumphal arch with its giant black star on the top
thousands line the route to see the heavyweight champion and cheer him
for ali its another kind of parade
theyre stockbrokers and street cleaners salesmen and secretaries hotel managers and military officers
all is a contrast to the de facto apartheid of the middle america of alis experience
they all cheer his caravan as it passes
arrives with ali and entourage
its a modern hotel
meanwhile a different group are about to depart in limos
one among them a tall man in a dashiki and sunglasses and carrying a walking stick separates
he sees ali
so does the woman next to him
she is the poet maya angelou
shouts brother muhammad
taking off his shades we realize its malcolm x
he wears a goatee now

youll never guess who malcolm ran into

english translation into phone hold on a second
bradley an american in his late s whos balding and whose mouth is too wide sits at the teachers desk in an empty classroom
a heavyset american and two black african thugs with m carbines are with him
in french le ministere de defense vous remercie

eight uniformed soldiers are with them
in the sports court on their knees hands bound behind them facing away from us are six prisoners in business clothes
one is a woman
guarding them are bradleys guards
mobutus military aides soldiers take over the prisoners
mobutus military aide talks into a walkie talkie
listens to his walkie talkie
he has distant eyes
hes heard what he needs and walks up a staircase and around a corner
he is the beneficiary of this routine military coup
other uniformed officers at students desks now stand and applaud
mobutu will rename the congo zaire and well see him later
meanwhile in ghana

his thoughts shouldnt have quarreled with the honorable elijah
the rapport between them becomes fleeting
alis attention drifts away
he closes down
to himself you shouldnt have
vocalized quarreled with the honorable elijah muhammad
you shouldnt have quarreled with elijah muhammad
and ali separates
he turns away
malcolm calls after him
ali wont turn back from his rejection of malcolm
he shakes his head no and walks off
sings for your precious love and reveal ali sonji roi dancing

past a speed bag onto ali with dundee sarria on the exercise table
they do not see and we pass them and other training boxers and move in to a portable b w tv on top of a cabinet
exchange greetings and introductions as if in a first time meeting and king turns back to camera
mid statement i fear if this bill is not passed
beat our nation is in for a dark night of social disruption
as an anchorman pontificates
image suddenly becomes five different surveillance angles
king and malcolm have no clue how extensive is the fbi cointelpro surveillance and the operations mounted against them
and the image of the two of them becomes
on the front page of the washington post
reveal joseph x sitting next to joe smiley in a small washington d
why we meeting
the idea was
malcolm smaller you know
not to turn him into a messiah
the paper what i got now is malcolm shoulder to shoulder with martin luther king
beat and malcolm running all over the world getting ben bella and nasser to denounce racism in the u
while were competing over there with the soviets
a resounding success
we were better off before with malcolm inside the nation
we want you
to get elijah muhammad
to take malcolm back
joseph x stares at him slack jawed
thats a joke
dont you ever smile
joseph x doesnt say anything
he does not smile
were on a timetable
malcolms pal quaison from ghana is introducing malcolms resolution to the general assembly in washington
thats in five weeks
joseph x oddly gets up moving a stool over

smiley indicates the picture of ali in muhammad speaks identifying him as a militant and a revolutionary
when do i get my expenses reimbursed

with large glass what you wanted isnt it

this dress makes what she had been wearing look demure
tight angora sweater and a miniskirt

ali takes her back into the bedroom and closes the door

all except the dress
i aint puttin no bleached out double ugly bedsheets on this body honey
he picks her up
she moans and her tongue darts in his ear and theyre on the bed making out
and as camera drifts away we hear d
daddio daleys jazz patio
king of the city cruising through the pristine winter air of chicago
on radio hey there old aware ones
and you too my fair ones
this is daddios jazz patio
on kbca this fine day which is a okay
brubecks time out cruising
center punches the frame through the green glazed terra cotta hallway
he and his bodyguard come to a door
shedding his coat he hesitates and like a prizefighter gathering himself he goes inside
at a light waves to a cluster of girls waiting for a bus who recognize him go nuts
listening to brubeck
walks across the stage aware of every little sound every motion
he makes his way to the podium
peering beyond his glasses at the gathered
bodyguard goes to the side door instead of standing next to him
and malcolm notices that
as salaam alaikum
wa alaikum salaam
and two young black men talmadge hayer and norman butler immediately stand up in the back jostling each other
shouts what you doin in my pockets man
get your hand outta my pocket
hold it hold it brothers
pleading lets be cool
and the commotion in the back diverts bodyguards and towards the rear away from the stage and malcolm as
thomas johnson comes forward from a front row his coat flapping open revealing the gauge sawed off double barrel shotgun coming up
go to it
settle on it
he new it was coming as
johnson an indifferent expression on his face fires one barrel at
which rips through the lectern as if paper and slams a dead center into his chest a seven ring
pellets each the size of
seven destroy malcolms heart
five shred his aorta and burrow into his spine
malcolms hands fly back and he topples crashing off empty chairs onto the floor
as life exhales from his mouth and his eyes go grey dying indifferent to johnson emptying a second blast into him and the meaningless indignities of hayer and butler firing
and a mm luger at him
dave brubeck loud
malcolm on the floor
betty kneels over his body desperately trying to breathe life into it
an asian woman a disciple holds up his head
somebody shouts jesus god
but there is no god today
stops short at a light because a man runs across the street
loud brubeck in time
ali cant hear
from the bullet holes black eagles flew
they screaming through the streets
ali rolls down the window
dazed they killed malcolm
they shot malcolm
daddios jazz patio is interrupted
malcolm x has been killed
ali pulls over
not really parking
the world stops
the south side of chicago goes still
a young man sitting down on the curb crying
sam cookes a change is gonna come
i was born by a river in a little tent
and as ali sits in his car
he sees the face of malcolm
his thoughts you were the first
you walked me forward my brother
you were the first
hes overcome with a deep grief and a lack of confidence in the order of his world
sings been a long long time comin but a change gonna come yes it is
the arena is surrounded by fbi the stands are only half full the promoter has taken out a million dollar insurance policy due to cassius clays membership in the militant
and radical black muslims because of death threats
oh and by the way
sonny liston is here too
sees sonji enter in a sequined mini dress bouffant hair
she attracts attention and disapproval from herbert
she sits next to alis parents at ringside amid the large conservatively dressed muslim contingent
hes angry at her presentation
she looks like a girl singer from a doo wop group
he slips off his robe
ali raises his gloves in muslim prayer
meanwhile the bell rings
meets liston nails him with a straight right
ali begins baiting him dancing
liston tries to cut off the ring jabbing ineffectually
ali lets liston in pulls back then pivots on his right foot throws a short right and ramp into slo mo
to see liston not see it coming
the muscles of alis upper body contract and ripple in release after his short right catches liston on the point of his chin
liston drops to the canvas like a stone
liston is down
scarcely a minute into the first round i cant believe it
sonji is up
for some reason tears of worry stream absurdly from her eyes
the image ali standing over liston fist cocked bellowing get up sucker
get up and fight
no one gonna believe this
liston tries to get up rolls over
his left leg spasms
as the ref finally pushes ali to a neutral corner
its over its over
sarria bundini pacheco as dundee cuts the tape off muhammads hands
and sonji appears at the door
runs and embraces ali
hes cold whats wrong
why you done up like that
im dyin and
cause this is how i dress
i dyin for you out of worry
and all you care about is if i look dull enough
the world looks at me girl
what if i straightened my hair live in the white suburbs
how i am says something
quiet tough well sorry you dont like how i am
enters up the stairs
bundinis waiting for him as are reporters trying to ambush him
lots of activity in the motel forecourt
to bundini wheres herbert
bundini indicates and ali exits into herberts room
beyond is the holiday inn marquee clay vs
a few letters droop
what do i do
ali angry stands in front of herbert
if you want have no contact with her for ninety days
then you make a public statement of divorce in the mosque and islamic law will be satisfied
satisfaction is not makin it with the woman who send you to the moon
bundini has alis championship belt over his shoulder
man im the only normal person left around here and im a black jew who cant read and is half drunk
i gotta talk to you
bundini and herbert start to leave
please stay brother herbert
he aint your brother
your brother taking your wife back to chicago
shes crying like a widow
i aint dead
you might as well be
you dont remember your name or who you are
leaves the room
stands at the dresser
only his suitcase is there
she left her chartreuse blouse
he takes it and smells the scent of her cologne
he is torn with grief at the loss of her curling into a ball on the bed alone in the room
getting made up by a good looking asian cosmetologist
an assistant director lounges against the wall with headset reading the newspaper
you got the prettiest eyes
he so pretty when you look up pretty in the dictionary he too pretty to be there
she laughs and whispers something in alis ear holding his hand where the others cant see it and slips her phone number to him
a phone rings
bundini answers while
re newspaper to ali you gonna try for germany
you gonna try to get stationed in germany
what you talking about
ali didnt know they changed your classification
turns page its in the paper
youre gonna get drafted into the army
takes phone you know about this
but i think the governments looking to negotiate a deal
hears on headset here we go
wide world of sports is on the air
weve entered mid broadcast
i flunk their draft board test

and to think i gave up a lucrative practice for the likes of you
im the best thing that ever happened to you howard cosell
without me you be a tall white man with a microphone in his mouth
fast and without me
youd be a mouth
ali lifts howards toupee
into camera well be right back
ali pours three spoons of sugar in his coffee
sarcastic have a little coffee with your sugar
you were saying something half smart
they want to make an example out of you
im no stokely carmichael h
all they are is political
they tell people how they ought to be
but you are the heavyweight champion of the world
and they dont like your militancy your politics
so theyll make an example out of you
of a good ne gro who do what he told
or to demonstrate here is what happens to your ass if you dont
hes screwed either way
waits at the curb as ali and herbert pull up and get out of a car
move through the crowd
reporters shouting questions at him we dont hear go up the steps into the lobby joining other recruits and m
quietly you do six weeks basic
you go into the reserves
you dont go to vietnam
you get to box
you even get to keep the money
he gives ali a piece of paper signed by the justice department confirming the deal
lets him know the messenger would not object if you joined under these terms
i stay out of jail and i get to fight
nods all you have to do is accept the induction
and life goes on
they call your name
you say yes
were not sure what ali will do
lined up with the twenty five other inductees
being addressed by an induction officer naval lt
and you will take one step forward as your name and service are called and such a step will constitute your induction into the armed force indicated
claridge begins to read the names and services
the young men dutifully stepping forward
ali expects his name to be called
cassius marcellus clay
alis lips move
no sound comes out
we anticipate him stepping forward
clay i am required to inform you that refusal to accept a lawful induction order constitutes a felony under the universal military training and service act punishable by up to
five years imprisonment and a five thousand dollar fine
do you understand
two fbi agents in suits have appeared
repeats cassius marcellus clay
ali doesnt move
a third time cassius marcellus clay
ali stands his ground
and the die has been cast
presenting badge federal bureau of investigation
clay youre under arrest for refusing induction
as they turn around and handcuff him
approach from two vehicles
rudy and six large muslims escort ali through the crowd of media trucks reporters and conspicuous unmarked police cars and neighborhood people
waves in robert lipsyte the new york times sportswriter in his late s weve seen before
he and howard bingham waiting inside know each other
the phones already ringing
on the phone on a long extension joined by lipsyte and howard bingham while bundini keeps at bay reporters at the front door
it all feels like a rock group in town for a concert
listens to cam

wry playing to bingham yeah

ali hangs up
the phone rings again
frustrated what do i think about who
next is something ali has not deduced
ali perceives it intuitively and reflexively
as with other of his decisions once made he doesnt hesitate to speak them
and he wont waver
man i aint got no quarrel with them vietcong
it goes dead silent
lipsyte is stunned
no vietcong ever called me nigger
you know what you j j just said
he hangs up
from europe to china
every home in america
the worlds gonna know what the heavyweight champion of the world said about the u
beat i aint gonna be what anybody else want me to be
im not afraid to be what i want
and think how i want
and thats the real ali right there
laying on the sofa
dundee pacheco and rudy have joined
theres the feeling the house is a bunker
television is on
lipsyte taking notes watching walter cronkite on tv
he crosses to ali
dundees on the phone
reading nixon the republicans boxing commission in new york cleveland and l
a foregone conclusion but youre also getting attacked as unpatriotic by the naacp roy wilkins jackie robinson the new york times and joe louis
the expression on alis face is blank as if hes accepting a pounding he knows what it is its not a surprise
a very low ceiling were in a green lit cavern with a low ceiling
chauncey eskridge and ali wait
alis in the backseat of a lincoln
two foi guards stationed at the distant ramps allow a black oldsmobile to pass
a new york lawyer and promoter arrives and climbs out of the oldsmobile
ali opens the door
but doesnt get out
to arum people are following me
i got almost nowhere i can promote a fight for you
plus i think theyre going to vacate you from the crown
if youre convicted
they gonna take away what no fighter in the world can
and new york may revoke your boxing license
you sure you want to do all this
politics your next three to four years are every heavyweights prime
and there are few of those years
what bout terrell

terrells running his mouth
he said if youre called you should serve
he got a deferment for bein too tall or havin flat feet
why dont he serve for me
tellin me what i should do
to ali eskridge i got to get you some fights
alis quiet not really listening anymore
wearing a suit and a narrow tie at a table in front of daley machine apparatchiks
a bald man angrily you understand we could take away your license to fight terrell in illinois
are you prepared to apologize
about your unpatriotic remarks that you made
you said that you were the peoples champion
angry yes sir
do you think youre acting like the peoples champion
i am not going to apologize to you
this isnt a courtroom
and i dont have to sit here and answer your questions
ali gets up and walks out on them
eskridge and noi men in black suits follow
march through the lobby
ali gives a walking interview
he wont slow down
i aint draft dodgin
i aint goin to canada
i aint burnin my draft card
i aint burnin the flag

here at home
ernie terrell is taller than ali
the empty stadium has a scale and press at one end
girls in cowboy hats and lone stars say were in texas
ali is distracted
getting on scale tell clay he can get on after me
get on the scale after
cuts in what you call me
terrell wrongly thinks theres psychological value in provoking ali
only thing i knows you as cassius clay
infuriated announce it right here or from flat on your back
ali throws a punch that doesnt land because hes separated
whats my name
something else in his eyes
hit four times by ali wham wham wham wham
in the glaring lights
whats my name motherfucker
and ali flicks out punches
ali hits him five times
terrell ties him up
ali throws him off slips two jabs and snaps his left into terrells face
whats my name
ali at the apex of his athletic skills fires six or eight punch combinations and then changes direction
ali shoots jabs and hooks going backwards every move and set of combinations is a dance
alis never been as light on his feet as fast as complex as in this fight
like any moment of greatness we want it to last forever
then ali throws a punch combination
that burns down terrell
terrell starts to fall
ali moves away
he doesnt want it to end
sportswriters dont like it
half the fans dont like it
ali defies both their sensibilities and their politics
face is battered
ali slams in shots
shouted my name
whats my name
the bell ends the savage pounding
ali in the middle of the ring glorying in opposition and triumph
with eskridge and his other attorneys
the courtrooms packed
in the back we spot joe smiley anonymous in the crowd
to judge if the court would give me my sentence right now instead of waiting and stalling
obliges my pleasure
the jury has found you guilty of refusing induction into the united states armed forces
i sentence you to the maximum sentence allowable
five years imprisonment and a fine of ten thousand dollars
pause fast enough
your attorney will lodge an appeal
while youre out on bond i order your passport surrendered
ill not have you benefitting yourself by fighting abroad
on his way out of the building
media is held at the other end
looks dazed not sure how to act on the way out of court
oddly he shakes hands with each of a half a dozen white houston bailiffs
its as if benumbed by the verdict he seeks human contact
the only contact available ironically is with the officers of the court that just convicted him
time has passed
snows on the ground
hes in a car coat and a hat with a hooded sweatshirt underneath
street lights are on
he walks through the whiteness as new snow falls
under the hat brim his gaze is internal as it was in the opening in miami
with icicles from fire dept
his work boots stop deep in the new falling snow
vanishing in the whiteout
in alis hands
he leans across a white showcase of bakery goods
its cold outside warm inside
it smells of bread and coffee
belinda boyd reacts
he makes a fist balls the scarf up and puts it in the hollow of his fist
offering blow on it
she blows on it
shes not quite eighteen six feet tall theres a supremely confident expressiveness about her
her gestures are large
he opens his hand
the scarf is gone
she instinctively looks over at his other hand
his eyes go wide in mock fright at the mysterious
dont get scared
howd he do it
he makes a fist again puts his thumb in the hollow
and slowly pulls the scarf out
laughs see you dont need to fight no more
he gives it to belinda
she ties it around her neck
ali looks at her
on a cold and dark afternoon the windows are steamed and the bakery seems a fine refuge
so whats fresh girl
smiles everything fresh
smiles whats the freshest of the freshest
smiles doughnuts just came out

a ring announcer pounds

finishes the african american albert speer regimented seating breaks up
alis wearing a black suit a white suit and white tie
as he drifts through the crowd approaching him is belinda in a white caftan and a white satin turban with gold earrings
it feels like they are an official couple eugenically chosen mates
she turns and leans back slightly against him
their thighs touch
we walk past the bakery
ali crosses the grey guttered street and exits into
cta bus passes
eskridge is there waiting for him
ali takes a coffee in a paper cup and grabs a danish
you see the ellis quarry fight
well be in front of the u
court of appeals next month
then we appeal to the supreme court
ellis the champ
i beatin on him since we was sixteen
they give ellis to joe frazier
frazierll kill him
then they out of juice
wheres the gate
so they gotta let me fight
i fight ellis in a phone booth
middle of times square
you think that draw a crowd
draw a crowd or not draw a crowd muhammad is not going to make a difference with your boxing licenses
they dont want you to fight
so much for speculation aclus handling your case against the new york boxing commission
they discovered new yorks got actual ex murderers and ex rapists currently licensed to fight
but revoked yours
state department refused permission for the one hour visa
no fight in tijuana
cant fight here
cant fight outside the country
i know people in the restaurant business
want to start up a chain
muhammad alis champ burger
muhammad malts fist full of fries
all of that
they start out towards the gas pumps
why i want to be in the restaurant business
cause you need the money
how much all this gonna cost
they do that to you too you know
they seek to destroy every facet of alis life
ali knows that
as they pass the pumps
some customers recognize him
where you goin
to customers look out
and ali pretends to start sparring
the working men laugh
one is brave enough to raise his hands too
ali smiles and trades a couple of phantom slaps
it breaks off
he made their day
he shakes each of their hands
his spirits raised he walks off
chauncey watches this ritual
hands and skin and faces against white in bed
so close we are intimately inside the moment
sister khalilah introduced you at assembly
you said you would be heavyweight champion of the world by the time you were twenty one
i always tell the truth
i was eleven
i interviewed you for the student paper
you called me little indian girl cause i wore my hair real long in a braid
i told you
man you scribble
you cant even write
you ought to go back to school until you do it better
laughing he starts poking her in the ribs and she turns onto him
shes six feet tall hes six three
he grabs her wrist
she wrestles him down on the large bed until theres a noise and belinda separates from ali and approaches a smaller bedroom to replace the bottle their daughter maryum threw
out of her crib
as she exits move in on the crib in streetlight and we hear jimi hendrixs bottleneck instrumental part of all along the watchtower
it makes us feel the child in the crib is threatened and that takes us into
in a black leather jacket with a white shirt and skinny tie speaking to an audience of college students white and black some asian and latino
from all along the watchtower there must be some kind of way outta here said the joker to the thief
bingham waits in the wings
ali joins howard and a small group watching a portable tv
occurring on chicagos north clark street
off screen we hear police sirens
on tv weathermen attack lines of chicago police
the cops fall back
theres too much confusion i cant get no relief
business men they drink my wine plowmen dig my earth none of them along the line know what any of it is worth
trains in grey sweats to hendrix
he flashes sit ups hanging off a table
he sweats profusely
he has no trainers
bingham holds his legs
ali seems heavier
the gym is grimy filled with other boxers a forest of heavy bags
alis one among other guys working out
grimacing through another set trying to stay in shape trying to retain skills going dormant
no reason to get excited the thief he kindly spoke
there are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke
then hes slow on the heavy bag
sparring alone in the ring
everyone ignores him
reveal ali bingham watching the olympics
now tommy smith and john carlos bow their heads and raise fists in black power defiance instead of acknowledging the national anthem
but you and i weve been through that and this is not our fate
so let us not talk falsely now the hour its getting late
and the coverage cuts to george foreman with a small american flag in his hand
then it flashes back to ali in the ring with sonny liston at his feet
and ali coming out of the illinois boxing commission angry
dead black panthers fred hampton and matt clark murdered by police in chicago
and malcolm x and ali together
the meaning of it is clear muhammad ali is the warrior saint in the revolt of the black athlete in america
on ali watching as a phone rings
all along the watchtower princes kept the view while all the women came and went barefoot servants too
speaks to ali on a pay phone on ground level
struck out at the appellate level in new orleans
so were heading back to the supreme court
thought we already got turned down there
im petitioning on a conscientious objection basis
well petition that your sincere religious belief prohibits you from shooting people
i believe theyll hear that
a fast car drives by distracting ali momentarily
then ali focuses on
where the money come from chauncey
herbert tell me im runnin on empty
put aside how do that happen
licenses all revoked
i cant fight here
cant fight abroad
beat and what happen if i lose the supreme court
its all over
you go to jail for five years
theres no response from ali
ali hangs up looks the other way lost in thought
hangs up the phone
starts to dial another number
a sound cracks open the night
chauncey runs up the stairs to the second floor balcony to join
cradling martin luther king jr
in his arms
king involuntarily spasms
under king dark blood pools like crude oil
eskridge andrew young and julian bond point into the memphis afternoon
as if they were pointing at a burning fire sirens blue police flashers an isolated gunshot
and reveal ali on a rooftop in sweatpants sweatshirt shadowboxing while
outside in the cold distance a wild cat did growl two riders were approaching and the wind began to howl
he leaves off to look into the distance
the agility what he was with terrell isnt there
he exhales in time with punches huh huh huh
alis struggling to hold onto diminishing sharpness
he contemplates the fabric of the city ripping itself apart while
reveal ali with maryum in his arms watches the fight
an activity from which ali the resident genius on the planet is excluded
ellis doesnt belong in there
curt man give him a shot he took a shot
i saw bundini in new york
you better get your belt b b back
belinda brings coffee to bingham
shes got to be done with that bottle
you call your parents ali

belinda takes maryum
frazier holds his arms up in victory a formality of applause from the half empty garden
to maryum maaan
joe frazier cant talk cant up the gate cant fill the arena
they gotta let me fight
that happen you promise me you put some new people around you
ali crosses to kitchen phone
i need angelo rudy ferdie ali shes talkin about brother herbert
between him and belinda this is important her solidarity is with her husband not with the noi
where are they when we need them
you got gene kilroy droppin off groceries like charity
borrowin money from my folks
as ali contemplates what shes said we hear
what are your feelings about up and coming ken norton
still sweating nortons big and strong but
someones talking into howards period headset
interrupting hold on one second
we have a caller
into phone cosell
this muhammad ali
a still photo of ali in an iris appears superimposed on monitors
go to georgia or alabama or sweden
everybody know im the champ
the crown is a lie
i know its a lie
joe frazier know its a lie
it time for everybody to stop lying and tell the truth
lets tell it like it is
with your court and boxing problems muhammad can you get a fight promoted
i aint interested in the paycheck id fight joe frazier for free in a phone booth in times square if i wasnt broke
i still will
did you say you were broke
how can you be broke
elijah muhammad reacts to the interview on television
theres a formality to elijah muhammad even at his kitchen table
youve made more money than all previous heavyweight champions combined
what about your management
surely they have provided for you
im saying its time for everybody to quit lying
muhammad ali is the champ
i have to ill get the fight on myself
beat and if they offer me money i aint gonna turn it down
crosscut elijah turns to an aide
get me my son herbert on the telephone
there is no entourage with him
ali hits the heavy bag
he doubles up the left jab on the taped together heavy bag
sweat stains his sweats
runs through tall reeds in the abandoned industrial landscape ending at the lakefront and the cold open sky and water
hes breathing hard struggling against time to hold onto shape and prowess
he seems vulnerable against the open sky and water
elijah muhammad is at the lectern ringed by fruit of islam guards
herbert is behind him
muhammad ali desires to do that which the holy quran teaches him against
i am therefore suspending mr
ali from the practice of islam
he may no longer appear in temple pray or teach or have any conversation with any muslim whatsoever
he may no longer use the name of muhammad ali
henceforward he will revert to his old slave name cassius clay
sits at the table
a deep vacancy is beginning to be there weve never seen before
may may makes a mess
you cant call me that no more
hell i cant
im defying them by talking to you
and being with you
move closer and closer into alis eyes
belindas pregnant again
she says something to him
ali cant hear
she says it again louder
ali doesnt look at her
over ali onto the formica table with log cabin syrup and powdered sugar and ceramic salt and pepper shakers seen in his ecu disconnected depressed withdrawn
entering concerned and urgent
whynt you call an ambulance or a doctor
following behind wouldnt let me
said he knew you
and to call you mr
hes not been out for three days
alis up the stairs down the corridor and takes the key from the lady and opens the door
its a dump
rotting food something burned on the stove
on the floor wrapped in a threadbare bedspread half in and out of the bathroom which is foul is bundini sleeping off a drunk
opens his eyes half sits watchu doin here
gimme that short dog
ali his concern crashes
he detests the type bundini resembles
he throws a half empty half pint of old taylor against the wall
whats wrong with you man
nothin wrong with me
ali goes to the curtains and pulls them back
d d d daylight
shielding his eyes leave me alone
i leave you alone
you called me
that were a week ago
ali grabs bundinis arm and twists it and pushes his sleeve up
bundini tries to pull his arm away
ali is way stronger
track marks up and down bundinis arm
ali slaps bundini on the side of the head
he slaps him again
what you shame yourself like this for maaan
why you shame yourself
bundini flails back with his arms
ali leans in and smacks him again
shouts im flyin
the sky chief talk through me
i know the word
you know low
you so low the curb look like up
the king gotta go home to his throne
from the root to the fruit
those rhymes is old
demonstrates more god dont care about you
dont care about me
in all of everything we mean nothin
he dont know us
and thats the onliest thing he did
and thats good cause thats why we free
but free aint easy
free is real
and realness is a motherfucker
low almost spooky it eats raw meat
beat it walk in its own shoes
beat it does not waver
theres a pause in the room
he starts crying unabashedly
i sold your belt for five hundred dollars to a barber on lenox avenue
thats how low i did you
im filled with weakness and got a crazy mind
that belt say you the heavyweight champion of the world
five hundred dollars and i put it into my arm
thats what i called to tell you
ali leans back against the wall
the last vestige gone
heard bout the nation all that court stuff
forgive me muhammad
take me back
theres no back to take you to
ali gets up bundini has been taken from him too and leaves
and beyond the side of alis face elevated through the slums and decrepit tenements of the south side of chicago
the mean alleys and decaying back porches
men gathered around gallon steel drums burning wood for warmth
everything is corrupted or has left him
staring into nowhere
the city recedes
vectors in perspective carry structures buildings away
the sky is grey going to blue
the city flees and suddenly disappears as we race into the dark tunnel of subway
alis lost in the depths of attempting a calculation
he cant do that for which he has a genius beyond other men
to himself you cant do what you do best in the world
and how you feed your family
who take care of your kids
and is allah is god with me
and hes been exiled from the belief system that explained the universe to him
suddenly lights slash across his face in the white tile north avenue station
beyond ghostlike working men and two heavyset women enter
ali turns aside to prevent being recognized
its the first time hes ever avoided the public
the train lurches forward
screams away from us
red reflects off the rails past alis face as we descend deeper into the tunnels
steps out of the truck
there is a small crowd of people who turn as ali pulls up in a convertible
hes solemn for a moment
then hes out of the car
a thousand dollars to the man who brings me howard cosells toupee
dead or alive
reveal ali next to his car
loud dont bother me
im a world famous broadcaster and youre an ex champion with diminished skills
i cant be seen you it would be calamitous to my reputation
alone in the convertible parked in a distant corner of the lot
put me on howard
muhammad id do anything for you
but i got bosses who only give a damn about nielsen ratings
it will be a historical and momentous night
ali being interviewed by howard cosell in the wide world of sports set
weve entered mid scene
what heavyweight champion of the world
im not the champ
i am retired finished out of the game
and i aint gonna let myself grieve and suffer none
but i know i will not fight again
i thought you were resolute in your resolve to regain your crown
if tomorrow they say we want you to fight joe frazier
madison square garden
millions and millionses of dollars
heres your license back
i will tell them i am sorry but i am done
what about frazier
youll have to wonder
what me and smokin joe would have looked like
you surprise me muhammad
howard you losing your hearing along with your hair
dont put questions to it
beat i am through fighting
cause i got a bigger and more important match comin up
a heavier contender
do you think youre going to jail
i dont know but its going to be a shocking and terrible fight
in fact they might wish they let me stay in boxing
joe frazier told me on this show he would knock you out
there you go agitatin
beat you ask smokin joe what he been smokin
joe frazier even dream he can whup me
he better wake up and apologize
pause but if i was to jump in the ring with joe heres what you might see
recites ali comes out to meet frazier but frazier starts to retreat if frazier goes back an inch farther hell wind up in a ringside seat ali swings with a
left ali swings with a right
frazier keeps backin but theres not enough room
it a matter of time before ali lowers the boom now ali lands with a right what
a beautiful swing but the punch lifts frazier clean out of the ring
fraziers still risin but the referee wears a frown cause he cant start countin til frazier come down
and fraziers disappeared from view
and the crowd is getting frantic
then our radar stations pick him up
hes somewhere over the atlantic
who would have thought when they came to this fight that they would witness the launching of a black satellite
theres laughter off camera in the studio and a wry smile on cosells face
but dont wait for they fight
cause it aint never gonna happen
you only can wonder and imagine
the phones in the master control booth and ringing off the hook
the publics reaction to alis brer rabbit routine
ali used his ability to command presence in media to promote the only fight the public wants to see
you want me to buy you a drink
alis dad sits on a crate painting the door of a delivery truck
he looks up
ali is there
emotion wells up in both men
the younger rebelistic son seeing his father who is so like him
the older hep cat who got cheated by life of his potential and promise
in this case his boy his boys name pride and reflected glory
i dont drink no more
squints at him you wanna fight
i dont wanna fight no more
not with you
as they embrace odessa comes out watches them
ali stands on the street corner shades incognito
a gold cadillac pulls up joe frazier
he is wearing a lemon yellow cowboy outfit stetson hat striped pants
ali looks at him in disbelief
who dress you joe
you look like dale evans
ali gets in frazier takes off
he sits sideways on the seat steers with one finger flicks on the radio isaac hayes
what the hell you in philly for
philly my town
to be closer to you honey
there be two undefeated heavyweight champions
and they aint fighting
i wanna fight you
said it a hundred times
the man wont let you fight no more
what you complainin to me for
cause you gotta get behind this and we gotta do this
frazier screeches to a stop in the middle of columbia avenue
gotta do nothin
you wanna get this on joe
you and me
what about your license
i can fight in atlanta
what about the boxing commission
georgia aint got no state boxing commission
and atlanta got a black city council a liberal jewish mayor sam something
it all set
i do a prelim in atlanta with jerry quarry
but we got to get the steamroller movin now
what i got to do
you announce that if i beat quarry you give me the title shot
puts it to him so what you say
frazier stops in front of his renovated duplex in the north philadelphia ghetto
my daddy was a sharecropper
i worked in a slaughterhouse
right on that corner
i came up from nothing
raises fist what i got i got with this
and i already got the title
so i got nothing to win and everything to lose
but you know you aint the champ yet
looks at him yeah
beat all right
you beat quarry ill get inna ring and fuck you up
they drive off
after a moment frazier looks sideways at him
quieter you need any money or anything to tide you by
turns away im fine
and ali rests a hand on fraziers shoulder and they drive off like that
alis sweating more than we have seen him sweat before
its pouring off him
it stains wet his grey sweatsuit
into his eyes through the headgear
bingham takes pictures
sarria rudy and the media in force are there for the start of alis comeback
a figure step through the door
ali seeing everything all the time reacts not at all turns his back
bundini is thin drawn stooped but clear eyed
it takes tremendous courage for bundini to walk to the ring expecting another rejection
ali goes to angelo in his corner
weights comin down
ali first acknowledges bundini
ali moves down the rope scowls down at him
what you want
take me back boss
you want me to take you back
beat and you a resurrection
this is gods act
anybody love poor people and little people and fucked up people gotta be a prophet
and the prophet is going home
you the sun
let me live in the light
pause take me with boss
beat ill do anything
ali considers this man all jive and bullshit and also his shaman and resident poet
quietly you cant hit what you cant see
bundini slowly comes alive then quietly float like a butterfly sting like a bee
they look at each other
quietly rumble young man rumble
weve entered mid fight in the second round
were very close
quarry has ali against the ropes
ali pushes him off
quarry comes in again
ali dances feints and catches quarry over his right eye with a jab thrown while going backwards
shakes it off
throws two jabs a right to the body and tries to follow it up with a left hook
ali ties him up
the ref separates them
quarry comes in again
ali throws a left cross over quarrys right which ali leaned away from and adds two rapid glancing jabs to the same spot
and ali opens a cut
the bell sounds ending round two
goes nuts that part thats pro ali atlantas black elite and scattered whites
and the thunderous noise becomes one sound one momentum cheering their warrior saint their defiant champions return
and their roar becomes thunder
a momentum unto its own driving
cant wait for the bell to ring
he sucks in a huge breath through his nose and blows it out
angelo applies vaseline
you the man
aint no kryptonite in this ring tonight
the bell sounds round three
past him hearing him we are him
we think what he thinks see what he sees
quarrys corner worked on the cut
ali feints a left and throws a left cross over quarrys attempt to block it
quarry comes in again
alis next three ripping left jabs almost like karate shots
all with a sharp snap at the point of impact
interposing himself between their arms
stops the fight
irish jerry quarry damned by skin that cuts and bleeds
their champion has returned
ali throws his arms in the air
quarrys arguing not to have the fight stopped
now he appeals to ali
ali knows quarrys anguish
ali says things to him
and for that moment they are an island
ali and quarry their arms interlocked are their own tribe
two pugilists no longer adversarial a class unto themselves
picked up by angelo
bundinis run into the ring
he is coming back
seated being examined by pacheco his hands still taped
the dressing rooms crowded
belinda enters embraces her husband
then ali hears a familiar voice
he sees herbert muhammad along with the expressionless joseph x and
another noi man have entered
low you dont need their management
ali squeezes her hand
and herbert quietly comes over
as saalam alaikum
all praise to allah
a beat and softly
and people feeling the awkwardness give them room
moving out of earshot
beaming the messenger has lifted the suspension muhammad
you saying i can be a muslim again herbert
cold i never stopped
like i never stopped being champ
i begged my father to reinstate you
after i promoted quarry fight
after i won it
we can get you frazier
i already got frazier
we can get you five million dollars for frazier
are we talking management talking money or talking religion
interrupts when i got leery and talked up how come im broke then came the suspension
now you explain that to me my brother
its my father
puts a hand on his shoulder i love the nation herbert
i love elijah muhammad
but it dont own me
herberts convinced hes getting told no
now you go on out
and you make the frazier deal
the reversal surprises herbert angers belinda
ali stops him keeps him distant
herbert and joseph x leave
you b b becoming a christian
forgive and forget
belinda stares at him containing her fury
ali confronts her look frankly then turns to get dressed
and belinda with new twin babies maryum dundee pacheco cassius sr
sarria and alis entourage
theyre all around long tables eating dinner
a large sign over the kitchen counter with lana shabazz ten commandments
anyone bringing guestes in for dinner without prior notice will be awarded thwacks on skull with sharpe object
please waite rome wasnt burnt in a day it takes a while to burne the roaste
lana shabazz answers a phone and brings it to ali
alis got one of the twins feeding her a bottle and drinking from it too
muhammad you t
what are you talking about howard
the supreme court ruled today in the case of the united states vs
cassius clay a
looks up you won an unanimous decision
takes in the news thanks howard and hangs up
it is a shining moment after living under the threat of imprisonment for three and a half years
what are you talking about
supreme court set me free
thats cause they know the king is gonna go home to his throne
and they know everybodys with you now
and they wanna be on the right side
a sea of glitter the black royalty of america in their s robes
movie stars rows back
burt lancaster is cosells color man
frank sinatra is working as a still
in the press section are plimpton types schulberg mailer types lipsyte cosell
descends from the overhead lighting grid
the announcers hand takes it
ladies and gentlemen fifteen rounds of boxing for the heavyweight championship of the world
ali looking out the hood of his robe dancing shaking it out loosening up
the contender and former heavyweight champion of the world seeking to regain his title from louisville kentucky muhammad ali
catcalls and boos
the other half is a comeback sound
it is a nation divided pro war right wingers nixon supporters are for frazier the anti war movement celebrities new york liberal establishment blacks puerto ricans and hippies are for
and in the opposite corner the current heavyweight champion of the world smokin joe frazier
the contentious roar diminishes only slightly for the announcer
deep in his focused concentration
his attention so arrow like it reminds us of the younger man in the liston fight
only silence as the referees instructions are given in slo motion
ali bounces on the canvas
we hear his feet shift turn dance
and his breathing expectant
here comes the return of what was unfairly taken his heavyweight championship
looks swollen out of breath
two solid ali jabs and a right hook connect
but they slow down frazier not at all
joe frazier short and compact like a pit bull bobs and weaves his way inside alis longer reach
none get through
ali looks slow
frazier off his bobbing and weaving launches his devastating left hook to alis head
frazier is making the most of what he is smaller
the referee separates them
both men throw and miss
ali on the right frazier on the left
ali throws a hard left that catches frazier but doesnt stop him
now frazier connects with a wild left hook into alis cheekbone
the is knocked down onto his knee
ruled a slip he stands immediately and continues
ali backed against the rope again blocks shots pushes frazier into the middle of the ring
but frazier cranks his left
ali sees it coming
to himself hooks comin
lean back man
but alis legs dont work fast enough
fraziers hook crashes into alis face
ali goes rubbery as he backs to the rope
ali comes out and backs to the rope on the other side with cartoon rubbery legs
but the mimicry is camouflage
he really is wobbling
the crowd is going wild
we hear everything now
he doesnt trust ali
he walks across the ring allowing ali to recuperate
ali walks to his corner drained
ali was out
he was out on his feet
joe almost had him
frazier must have thought ali was playing possum
cause alis a clown
others have come in on ali when hes playing possum and gotten knocked out
ali saved himself with guile
as if mirror images of each other
crouch looking for shots
alis right is down
fraziers right is down
as they both rise up out of the crouch fraziers out of the box first
alis right is coming around
fraziers left hook slams ali across the jaw
ali goes down
half the crowd roars for frazier
ali gets right up and stands in the corner and takes the mandatory eight count
the right side of his face is swollen like a balloon
ali takes another right but the ropes hold him up
another left catches ali
fraziers face is a grotesque swollen mask
he doesnt care
the crowd cheering frazier
ali drops his arms
he knows he lost
frazier raises his arms
he knows he won
half the crowd cheers
hell of a fight champ
not only have we seen ali lose for the first time not only do we see him bruised but when a fighters beaten everybody who believes in him is beaten
angelos cutting the tape off his hands
bundini places an ice pack on the back of his neck
they stole it from you
bundinis wise enough to say nothing
louder get outta here
as they leave the door reveals packed media outside
now its only the inner circle
to pacheco ferdie take a look at this
to ali it was still a hell of a fight
they took her to the aid station
pacheco looks at alis hand
pacheco looks at alis eyes and has him follow his finger
my hands was in sand angie
my feet in water
maybe we shoulda had more time between blin and this you know
to get back into
woulda shoulda coulda
pause after three and a half years this
from how far back
ali throws a water bottle
it shatters and splays wet down the wall
there is mature deep seated dead serious molten anger
everybody in the room feels it
with bundini bingham rudy and sarria as a wedge ali drives through reporters on the way to belinda
press mob ali
were you robbed
you lose you dont shoot yourself
the world goes on
joe said he didnt think you wanted to fight him again
stops oh how wrong he is
she begins crying
they killed you
ali moves to her followed by bingham and pacheco
a doctors approaching with a sedative in a syringe
get away from her
what is that
ali leans over speaks softly
i aint dead baby
embracing her his eyes connect with dundee
alis supreme court victory is meaningless
its drowned by the loss of what the political persecution took from him his prime his season that would have been his most brilliant
blur in slo mo
focus is beyond to the crowd
starts an arc
or jams towards us
we pass crowd the lighting grid above and slam into the side of alis jaw and on the moment of impact
of alis jaw breaking shearing leaving an eighth inch gap in the bone of the lower mandible
taking the shot covering and assaulting covering with his left which he turns into a jab aggressively going after norton
fills the frame
go behind it as they shield ali spitting blood into a bucket
i can move my jaw with my tongue
he got me
pacheco looks into his mouth
concerned its broke
i think your jaws broke
meanwhile ali spots
curious about the activity in alis corner starts over
nods to dundee
dundee starts to reach
ali snatches angelos hand holding the towel
angelos about to end the fight
aint stoppin nothin
glares at them nothin stoppin
a bell sounds and ali goes out to fight in an overhead shot
leave the ring and another defeat as they move up the aisle towards the locker room
the place is a huge mansion on chicagos south side
now that smokin joes run out of tomato cans to beat up i finally got yank to commit to a rematch with you in about six months
frazier said hed be happy with three mil
beat ill fly to jamaica and get yank to sign right after joe beats this big stiff
to tv they watch the frazier foreman fight from jamaica amid the wonderful chaos generated by kids and their toys who crawl all over ali as if he were furniture
frazier and foreman are in the center of the ring
we see don king in fraziers corner
through still wired together jaw foreman call me one time after he won the olympics
meanwhile frazier bobs and weaves ducks and moves like he did with ali
joe throws a left hook leaning forward with it
before it lands foreman unleashes a hard right that jolts frazier sideways
frazier throws another hook that misses
foreman hits him with a combination of right and three lefts
two hooks and an uppercut that lifts frazier off the ground
ali leans in to see
shouting frazier stands
the referee does the mandatory eight count
foreman bangs frazier into the corner and blasts him again
frazier tries to muscle out of the corner
foreman lifts and throws him back into the corner
foremans power is unreal
frazier is the man who beat ali
now frazier feints and slides sideways and foreman hits him in the back of the head
frazier goes down again
it is savage
here is a new world champion george foreman
wry b b be easy gettin a frazier fight now
he aint the champ of anything except getting knocked down
alis got joes powerful left tied up this time
ali having joe at the right range hits him
joe moves in
ali drags him closer and ties him up
ali does a little shuffle circles to keep joe at hitting distance lands a combination
joe closes but ali wont let him in and ties up joe
we hear a bell and thats the end of the fight
not a bang a whimper
holds up alis hand and mouths silently words we cannot hear
and as we move closer into alis eyes we see no exaltation
this is a victory but a hollow one
its a decision eked out
the inner circle ali pacheco dundee bundini bingham
so we only eked this one out
and george foreman makes frazier look like a sissy
you see their fight
you mean the joe frazier falling down lesson
and foreman is
you are years old
i dont want to see your head get turned into someones bulls eye
but you go
were the corner same as always
but it aint gonna be easy
to angelo you think i still got the tools
you got the tools daddy
but they different
thinks decides go well you better sharpen em up
cause we goin to africa
from the root to the fruit
we gonna rumble
in the jungle
its time to be heavyweight champion of the world again
rumble in the jungle
thats the name i given it
ali and don king hold court with the press
also there is george foreman and his trainer dick sadler and his manager nilon
a historical happening
this event will show that the black man has arrived on the world stage
muhammad ali and george foreman in kinshasa zaire
why not antarctica
whats wrong with new york city
because you miss the significance
i dream as martin luther king once dreamt that a man could be judged by the content of his mind
this is about black men helping black men overcoming four hundred years of racial depression to the dawn of a new day of liberation
financial and otherwise
king getting really evangelistic
it will raise up the spirit of our inner cities
it will rise up and fill with hope the souls the unrequited needs of the black proletariat that is the discouraged dispirited denigrated denizens of the demimonde that is called
alis looking at him in amazement
man you crazy
don king laughs
as the press digs king
move onto foreman and heres whats wrong with all of this
we see that foreman eight years younger two inches taller almost as fast and seemingly twice as strong is not beatable by muhammad ali
foreman just doesnt hurt you foreman can kill you
how is ali not going to get killed by this man
with death in his eyes and indifference on his face
ten million dollars
with one stroke of the pen you split the worlds biggest emolumation of the history of sports
ali signs a contract then foreman
the rumble in the jungle
don king bursts out laughing
push through people and see an air zaire dc pulling in
a ramp is wheeled up
the plane stops taxiing
zairian officials in safari suits paratroopers with white helmets lt
nsakala and hundreds of african european and american media with cameras and lights approach
the hatch opens
a roar emerges from the right and left
we dont see the source
belindas behind him
binghams there bundini angelo dundee sarria
as they crowd to the door were shooting over ali starting down the ramp
he looks up
we dont see what he sees
we see only the crowd of people at the foot of the ramp including don king in a dashiki and the crowd on the tarmac
looking above the receiving party
the roar again
he looks side to side almost distracted from king and the officials
distant crowd roar increases
theyre chanting something
we dont understand the words
it contains his name
are beyond the receiving party
theyre on the roof of the airport
theyre sitting on balconies and fences
theyre waving their arms
theyre on every possible horizontal surface that can support weight
theyre shouting in unison a syncopated roar
his name and something else
ali moves through the receiving party as if in a trance to get through the airport to the other side
security tries to keep up
emerges and reacts
dundee bingham and a few cops are with him
everybody else got left behind
reveal people are outside the airport cheering his arrival
their cheer is thunder
to zairian official shouts what are they saying man
why they saying that
they say ali boma ye
ali boma ye
whats that mean
i dont understand
cant hear what
has to shout it mean
ali kill him
ali kill him
ali moves forward
the zairian official and four cops fade back nervous about being in so large a crowd
the crowds a tidal wave carrying ali forward supporting never mobbing him
this is all for him
he is their hero
he defied the worlds powerful
they tried and could not destroy him
his defiance made him their champion
and now he has come to contest his rightful title against the numb instrument of the all powerful
he raises his arm too and shouts
ali boma ye
ten thousand voices carry it on the wind and take away alis breath
ali boma ye
in the rear realize as do we this is not merely a boxing a towering man in denims with sequins blocks our view of the door as he walks out
onto the ramp
only now do we see beyond him a small welcoming party
native african dancers a big banner that proclaims welcome george foreman the zairian paratroopers media and a few dozen of the curious
looks like superfly on steroids
his entourage follows him down the ramp
dick sadler tough and smart is the louis armstrong of trainers
archie moore crafty and wise wears a blue shirt and blue pea cap
if george foreman wonders at the paucity of his reception he doesnt let on
sits in extreme close up drinking coffee
lost in thought
hes somewhere else puzzled alone in his thoughts
he wears grey sweatpants a thin rubber long sleeved t shirt under his grey sweatshirt
hes oblivious to the euro modern furnishings
then its time and he leaves
enters from his bungalow
we see were in a compound
they are white and severely truncated houses linked by sidewalks and too many large street lamps
as ali starts to jog through this imitation of suburbia with the scale all wrong
its like a gulag in reverse for the rich and powerful to be within while keeping the rest of the country out
as ali passes reveal we are at the bank of the congo river
as ali starts his predawn run across the river the first band of magenta tints the horizon and reflects molten on the water
plus two trainers and the ever present zairian policeman lt
the early paints the red earth ochre
to himself fast
six left jabs flash from his chest and shoulder followed by a right hook and left and right uppercuts
to himself back up maaan
weaves suddenly another voice you fast
ali slides to the right and throws a left jab and hooks off the jab
ali enters running
the road is lined with mobutus green billboards in french and english proclaiming zaire wonderful
a few kids emerge from behind the signs coming out from between
and they trail ali
ali boma ye
repeating ali boma ye george foreman
and he throws a couple at an imaginary george foreman
there are to kids now
you out sucker
curious ali runs behind the green signs from where the kids came
behind the signs he becomes a magnetic attraction
people are surprised to see ali
hes making their day
euphoric kids parallel him run with him follow him
the concrete and cinder block walls to the dusty bare ground are chromatic
ali sees interiors
people come from a ditch with a shower curtain for privacy surprised to see ali
faces indifferent to squalor
this is the ethnographically interesting surface of what in fact is civic disintegration starting to occur
it is the human concomitant to years of mobutu kleptocracy
looks at the backs of the signs
he and we realize the signs purpose to hide the makeshift plastic walls and rooms made from cardboard containers and oil drums from the foreigners traveling the road to kinshasa
one teenager with a withered arm and a big smile runs up
broken english you beat them ali
i kill him
he mimes knocking out foreman
something powerful is affecting ali
we dont know what it is
ali slows down
throws two lightning jabs and a hook
ali reaches to the kids head and pulls a coin
he flips it to another kid and walks on
a second teenager comes out and wants ali to look at something around the back
he takes alis hand
and holds it
the entourage follows
its an imitation fight poster
childlike caricatures in basquiat like brush strokes
foremans got crosses for eyes
ali is victorious
his fist is raised
his cartoon face shouts his victory
the peoples champion
theres knocked out white policemen knocked out black soldiers knocked out landlords knocked out south africa knocked out planes and tanks knocked out tse tse flies
so much it means all
this childish painting powerfully affects ali
the kids look at him
some kids in the back leap up in the air to see over taller heads what alis doing
looks at individual faces
a grinning older man with a blue transistor radio well see him later
a smiling kid
a girl with no shoes
a teenage kid jumping up and down
all looking at him
ali makes four pieces of rope appear
he rubs them together
they become one
everybody goes nuts
as ali leaves his eyes go back to the people and the painting
to himself even if i die here
if it kill me no matter what
i gotta win
concentration has taken him into the athletes zone the state of unified awareness wherein dwells his total self knowledge
and he knows the transaction what they give him with their adoration which he converts to power is in exchange for what he means to them
and what he means to them is specific he represents them in defying power and vanquishing what oppresses
he validates the existence of expectation that struggle is possible
george foreman mute and unknowingly represents disinterested power
ali doesnt accept his obligation he embraces it
it is his purpose revealed
and he will never waver from it
waits sitting on a table edge in a corridor
noise of a press conference setting
howard cosell crosses through smoking
bingham enters and gestures
ali waves off bingham stops cosell
how many you ugly sportswriters in there got me over foreman
beat some of us
how you gonna dance against george
hes sparring with a middleweight training to cut you off
he gets you against the ropes he can knock you out with either hand
drops facade whats the odds
two and a half to one
were worried youre going to get hurt
no one thinks ali will win
thisll be the biggest upset since sonny liston
i want all of you to write it down
this fight is no contest
weve jammed into the middle of ali in a blast of braggadocio
george foreman is a big mummy
ive officially named him the mummy
george punches are like look out here come the left
stiff armed swing here come the right
like a mummy
but the mummy cant hit what it cant see
be all over george
george is gonna feel he surrounded
beat and i done somethin new for this fight i done rassled with an alligator
theyve had twelve years experience of alis stand up and know when a new routines starting
laughter again ali almost loses it i have rassled with an alligator
i done tussled with a whale
i done handcuffed lightning thrown thunder in jail
only last week i murdered a rock
injured a stone
hospitalized a brick
im so mean i make medicine sick
muhammad im sorry
i have to ask
he hesitates hes sorry but are you really fast enough anymore
to beat george foreman
many people believe you dont have the same skills that you are not the same man you used to be ten years ago
there it is
has doubt spoken truthfully in the open closed the mouth of muhammad ali
i didnt want to talk about this especially in front of everybody
but i talked to your wife
and she told me youre not the man you used to be
two years ago
the assembled media crack up
alis eyes are wide in mock amazement
a bittersweet smile and the eye contact with ali
is slammed by a massive fist
it leaves a dent the size of a deflated basketball
the fist is george foremans
holds the bag
foreman throws hooks one after the other
each blow rocks sadler
george is literally punching a hole in the bag
these blows would mash an opponents liver break ribs destroy kidneys
this man can do more than hurt you
this man can kill you
foreman is boxing a middleweight
he is smaller than foreman and therefore faster
and thats the point
the partner tries to circle slide dance away and foreman cuts him off and drives him to the ropes where he tags him
he doesnt put a lot behind it
darts left and jars him with three left jabs keeping him on the rope
foremans training to defeat alis dancing his float sting tactics
is young has unreal power and he can move
lieutenant nsakala is there too
they time share the facility
foremans entourage with conga drummers are exiting
ali and foreman are never closer than feet apart
foreman says nothing
ali starts banging his hands on foremans conga and shouts over the percussion at foreman
salaam alaikum brothers
raises one arm the champ is here
comparatively foreman looks bigger
he is more dense of bone
his chest seems deeper and his shoulders wider
is casual unrattled by alis antics
he is menacing in his indifference
it means hes also immune to getting psyched out by ali
bundinis in alis corner
alis sparring partner is larry holmes
alis hands are at his side
he dances bicycles shuffles dances dodges doesnt throw anything his elbows at his side
ali is training to dance from foreman
hes fast but not seemingly suspended in air as he was long years ago against liston
heres your water
brought all this stuff like africans dont have steaks
you could pick up parasites
they eat it
youre seeing what you want to see muhammad
mobutu eats it
mobutu is taking care of mobutu and stealing all the wealth and sending it to switzerland
whats that do with any of why we here
she doesnt get it were here cause don king got mobutu to put up ten million dollars
don king dont give a damn about africa
he worse than herbert
here come herbert
cause where was he when we was broke and borrowing money
and bundini and all them that love you
disappeared is where they were
on a roll all over you when you got it and drop off you when you dont
i do money making whenever i want
money is easy
running on and don king fit right in
that double breasted hipster is now a dashiki wearing rip off
don king delivered the first black promoted championship fight in africa
don king talks black lives white and thinks green
why you defending him and brother herbert
against me cause clean cut muslims parading on the south side of chicago dont get this done
i got to put honkeys with connections and bad ass niggers to it too
not hearing and now they got you up against george foreman
do they give a damn you could get killed
that what this is
think i gonna lose
puttin doubt on me
tears flow i think why is my muslim husband letting himself get strung up on a cross
it means tell me
ali picks up his bag and starts out
maryum is sick
maybe i oughta go back to chicago and look after her
ill be back before the fight
sarcastic if thats all right my husband
he walks out the door
angelo and bingham in the empty seating looking at the ring under the canopy
behind them is the rehearsal
arrive including in the first an interpreter zairian official a policeman driver and in the second car is don king herbert veronica and another american woman silent bit
theyre in a hurry
is being taught to dance by two dancers
in the background workers are raising gigantic mobutu portraits
the pointer sisters begin
don king and entourage approach
over the drumming champ
george had an accident
suspicious what are you talking about
pointer sisters start yes we can can
right above his right eye
his sparring partners elbow
split it open so
can he fight
not for six weeks
this is not a humorous situation my champion
this postponement could be long especially if george leaves
are you tryin to pull something don
ali wants his title
and he wants it back in zaire
george leaves he aint comin back
george dont like it here
pointer sisters rehearsal cuts
how right you are my suspicious and short italian brother
and my fiduciary responsibility to this first all black promotion is like a garden in the african sun
it must grow
it must bloom
it cannot flower in the gloom and shade of postponement to some dome
like the astrodome the super dome any dome outta zaire where it be deprived of light and bled of water
cause what gonna bleed
a hemorrhage of cash
sees it all blood on the floor
double hotel costs
double travel costs
food and beverage
rhetorical what do you expect us to do don
moves close to ali muhammad
find a way to get george to stay
be moses in reverse do not let my people go
stay the fuck right here in egypt if youll pardon my swahili
l l l lingala
they s s s speak lingala
pointer sisters probably end here
after a beat percussion starts up
dancers drift in
pissed dissed big if george goes
you forfeit five million
you crawl back to cincinnati
you aint promotin a charity raffle
we see herbert watching all of this closely
particularly the challenge to ali dundee
irrepressible if george goes
george goes my champion i will get you joe frazier
ali frazier iii
the fight everybody want to see
interrupts truth is
george knocked hisself out
don king laughs nervously
ali is daring george to stay
he did three rounds
knew he was gonna lose to muhammad ali and knocked hisself out
and i predict that whenever the fight is set he might not show up
double entendre you bad
im a bad man
aint no doubt about it
and you tell the same thing to george
media laugh don king goes along ali continues
to king i been watchin you
i heard you
i know hes your man
i know you got him picked
but the mans in trouble
the whole world was gonna know
but now he aint gonna show
thats why he knocked hisself out when he was training
laughs to dismiss ali we will reschedule the fight and to ensure george is ready we are thinking of postponing from september th to october th
what about the concert don
that would go off as planned on september nd and rd
skeptical uh huh
i want all helicopters guarded
i want the airport im serious i want president mobutu and all his paratroopers
mobutu and all his paratroopers
i want all of you zaireans to be on guard
watch all strange boats tryin to slip away
they might be takin him out
the bus station
its ali kidding on the square
a serious point delivered not seriously to be taken seriously
watch the bus station
he might sneak out by elephant
bundini thinks of a line and whispers it to don
don leans past dundee to pass it on ali
what you say
i aint talkin to you
to king hey
his eyes flash
he leans forward and puts a finger in don kings face
dont talk to angelo like that
dont you talk to him like that ever again
ali aint fucking around
ali has reasons for working with don
belittling angelo cuts across all that
dangers in the air
dundee puts his hands up
you think youre callin these shots don
ali pulls out a comb and starts to comb his hair
to king they know
segues into a routine all those ladies out there know
ali being mercurial is unexpected by don
laughter from particularly the women as he combs his hair and segues
mock demagoguery they know im ready
i see fear in the eyes of his followers
i see fear
this is the fight that muhammad ali was supposed to be ended
the myth of muhammad was supposed to fall
hits the table with his fist glares at king supposed to be my destruction
french voices and laughter understated they miscalculated
they got it
alis served notice to anyone with ears to hear it hes multidimensional strategic and dangerous as hell
a taste of whats to come
ali talks to a blonde reporter from france and settles next to lloyd price without a shirt
everyone crowds around their table
a zairian interpreter and lieutenant nsakala are present
ali disregards their presence because his attention tracks
seen over the heads of zairians
shes feet inches tall
without acknowledging shes the object of alis attention her radar tells her shes the object of alis attention
veronica turns sees ali
i know you
over veronica as she makes her way to the table by alis side where he takes her hand in his
i dont think so
whats your name
like the sports car
but with a little something extra
beat veronica i know you now
cmere sit down
he steers her into the chair next to him which is immediately vacated by lloyd price
you with don
don brought me here but im not with
the others are paying them no attention
bundini stands to talk to howard cosell
theres an ocean of side conversations
alis presentation to veronica is natural open admiring
it is not seduction
its more seductive than seduction
she feels from ali nothing predatory or exploitative
only the warm rays of the sun from his open face and appreciating eyes
still holding her hand
where you from
meanwhile george foreman with sadler moore broadus sees and laughs at ali and veronica and onto george foreman going into hotel
but my people are from louisiana
so im african french spanish my mothers grandfather was jewish
looking at her admiringly well
they all came together real nice
hesitating low im glad you said what you did
you made sure this fight stays here
all them writers in there think foreman gonna
eyes go wide what you think
ali boma ye
meanwhile chinese and some vietnamese approach and wait patiently
ali has to force his attention away from veronica to respond
they all bow
the zairian interpreter translates english to french to another zairian who speaks mandarin
it all gets lost in chaos while bingham shoots pictures and a plimpton type explains pedantically to bundini
shes an african succubus
means witch doctor
suck my dick
they aint room in africa for more than one witch doctor
and thats bdini
the eyes of some of the asians are very emotional
ali stands up and bows to them
chinese bow themselves away
ruth pointer arrives
ali kisses her
she sits but talks to bingham
you been to hong kong
i cant go there
all the ladies out there from indonesia japan hawaii india
high pitched voice imitating female fans ali i i e e e
ali e e e
oh muhammad al i i i
speaks in faux foreign language imitating female fans to bingham you seen those people from thailand
i was in bangkok i couldnt walk
laughter hangs his head i couldnt
i just couldnt do nothin
get me outta this country
laughter the women were so pretty
b b b bout hong kong man
you know what i heard
interrupts ladies in thailand their hair comes down to their knees
and they about veronicas complexion
and they bad
but they aint nothin like the sisters
holds veronicas hands looks deep into her eyes aint nothin like the sisters
veronica laughs as ali mocks swooning over her
another news crew arrives
to veronica lets go for a ride
and old people teenagers in dirty t shirts with strange hats
their eyes are wide
shows his bare hands
now he rubs them together and magically pulls from his closed fist a colored scarf
the kids scream
squints trying to figure out how he did it because
shows the scarf pushes back his cuffs so that he cant hide anything up his sleeves
his wrists are bare
he shows both sides
now he takes the scarf and pushes with his right hand and feeds it into the closed fist of his left
he looks up wide eyed at everybody
then he opens his fingers and the scarf is not there
walk towering over the kids
one girl holds alis hand
the others maintain a respectful proximity so that they dont invade the space around ali
so why you glad we still here
holdin this in africa make people proud
all over the world
theyre proud of you
anybody can fight in vegas
thats one job
i got two
they pass through cinder block houses shipping crates oil drums for cooking fires a few car parts
melodramatic gotta whup george
islamic faith help you to that
listen girl as a muslim i am busted out and failed in the eyes of god
i shoulda discovered islam at
cause i am weak on women
they take my eyes and my heart follow
causing me to be a lovin husband and a terrible husband
looks down at her intensely green eyes and cocoa skin
feigns wobbly legs okay rest of me lets go
she brings his hand up to her mouth and kisses it
hand in hand a towering man and a towering woman walk away at their ease against the soft sky with their entourage of teenagers and kids
on the perimeter a kid does flips and then gets distracted
a syncopated obscuring blurred shape of the bag turned into a percussion instrument by alis fast hands trying to get even faster
to himself faster
ali slams a right hook at the bag
it almost explodes
optional ali takes body hits tries sliding off head shots
feints his left and throws a right
it surprises holmes
you cant lead a right hand
not at him
to get it there
man i mean to think you could hit him with a right lead
nobody would lead a right
ali sees something beyond the ring
and now flicks four ripping left jabs into holmes and slides sideways as holmes tries to catch ali with a right
but ali changes directions changes back and now comes over holmes right with his own left cross and a six or seven punch combination
it is ali dancing and floating
meanwhile has thrown his arms around dick sadler foremans manager
we realize this is why ali segued from serious work to snapping his traditional left jab
i got him
lock him up
laughs hey hold up chump
make this chump turn me loose
sadlers there with his wife and another couple
rudy joins laughing
bundini turns loose sadler
ali and sadler like each other
this is my wife irene
sadler affectionately puts an arm around alis neck and reaches up and pretends to hit ali on top of the head with a fist for binghams camera
ali bites his lower lip and starts wrestling with sadler putting him in a headlock
sadlers arm is around alis waist
look at george foremans trainer feelin me up on purpose
on the side to see if im in shape
sadlers beret falls off
rudy puts it back on
can i have your autograph
well you aint gonna find no fat
lunges for wifes note pad give me that thing
breaking through muhammad
give her an ali button
the gang laughs
no you aint
concedes all right give my wife an ali button
shes gotta put it on
give my wife one
bodini you got ali buttons
george buttons is all i got
in my bedroom
all over the bed
to remind me
of all of ya
all of ya
reminds me of all ya
throughout the above hes pretending to jab at dick whos laughing and feinting at him
fond relationships transcend the adversarial roles
they are all of the tribe of boxers
sadler is a particularly bright and talented man
accompanied by an american reporter is nabbed by a french news crew
in french pardon
vous etes de lambassade des etats unis
vous avez une prediction
english translation excuse me
you are from the u
do you have a prediction
in french caught smiles je suis avec lagence americane dinformations
il ne mest pas permis dexprimer mes preferences entre deux citoyens des etats unis
english translation caught smiles im with the u
im not allowed to take favorites among two united states citizens
he walks away
sits on the apron of the ring
ali joins him
meaning sadler he gone
leaving steals a glance at ali and dundee
the camaraderie was not false
both are true
but being strategic he is a threat to ali
george has a first rate team
enters with howard cosell and howard bingham and a two man news crew
when did you get in
muhammad may i have a word with you please
belinda starts towards the bedroom
ali looks to howard and gestures with his hand to get rid of everybody
as the bedroom door closes cosell crew and bingham cant wait to get out of there
what is going on
you know whats going on
its not the first time but i dont have to have it thrown in my face
i dont have to read about it and have people call me up on the phone about it
i didnt mean for it to come out
oh hell muhammad you got no discretion
you never did
you humiliate me
belinda slams a lamp standing next to her
i clean for you
i cook for you
i feel every punch you take
i know that
then why you got to be visible with women
i didnt mean for it to be
i live with the casual ones
gestures to veronicas clothing but this this
i cant hold it together anymore
i dont want to hurt you
youre a good wife to me
then why do you disrespect me this way
i respect you
i always respect you
a terrible question occurs to her
do you love her
ali doesnt answer
do you want to marry her
i follow my heart
youre following your heart
sarcasm falls away thats what you do
no matter what anybody says
or what it does
pause and what happens now
i fight george
after a beat i didnt come this far to quit
neither of us did
ali looks at her a moment
then he leaves
belinda sits on the bed
she looks up
then she comes apart
she rips open a closet
she finds veronicas clothes rips them shreds peignoirs overturns a night table strips the bed smashes more furniture throws veronicas suitcase at the mirror
it does not break
she looks around the wrecked room
bingham is standing there
belinda looks up tears in her eyes
you cant beat him
you cant beat him cause you cant not love him
under the water
it flows like silver down the contours of his face and neck
he is in that zone of concentration where the best athletes go
where the pre motor cortexs activity dominates and facial expression becomes blank eyes look distantly
alis in his domain
in the groove
and outriders depart
prepare a luxurious setting
on a platform is a large tv set
in front of it with low tables are two large armchairs with antimacassars
at the door are mobutus spit and polish paratrooper bodyguards
they stomp their feet to attention as
in his tan uniform and signature leopard skin hat enters followed by an entourage of aides
in french we are ready your excellent president for life
in french invite monsieur idi to join me now
in french they are waiting in the sitting room
wrapping alis hands tears the tape into narrow strips to go between the fingers
doc broadus from foremans camp observes the wrapping then signs it
in addition to function the taping feels ritualistic
attention is focused elsewhere
on his action what he will do his strategy
from doorway countdown
countdown is on bro
ali gets off the training table
angelo has finished
he puts on his robe and starts warming up before the mirror throwing punches for a full minute
ali and herbert go to an alcove
thanks to allah
praying shouts four minutes
sarria sticking sealed bottles filled with honey orange juice and water into the water bucket
as ali puts on the robe the others gather up the gear start out
herbert moves to ali preparing for the entrance to be as close to him for the cameras as possible
give us a moment
off herberts look hey
this is my religion
herbert and pat patterson the bodyguard with his chrome plated
follow the others away from ali
angelo begins applying vaseline on alis face
theyre alone in the room
monsoon seasons about to start
may hit in the ring under the lights
you all right
where you at
looks up foreman aint no mummy
hes knocked out eight out of eleven before the end of the third round
he the most dangerous fighter i ever fought
id worry if i was hearin anything else
ali loosens up his neck
and i cant wait
thats the most important
ali looks at dundee enigmatically
before angelo can ask
throws towels across alis shoulders
ali puts on his long african robe which is white with african graphic trim on the cuffs of the sleeves and the hem
whispers forget every battle of man against man of mind against mind of soul against soul
this is the one
this is the greatest
ali nods to him
this is it
the prophets come back to claim his own
get the pretender off that throne
rumble young man rumble
its the rumble in the jungle
starts moving towards the door
they open the door
it is guarded by a handpicked squad of paratroopers and lieutenant nsakala
shouts one minute
paratroopers on either side like a wedge guarding ali with angelo bundini rudy and herbert as they push through the door out into the hall
people in the corridor at the end see ali
the chant begins
boma ye ali
the sound from the corridor picks up a second reverberation that booms from a distant vast space
as we move towards it to encounter it
and suddenly we
lights flood it
they pour down artificial sunshine
ali boma ye
ali boma ye
ali boma ye
roars from voices at a quarter to four in the morning
the moon is out revealing storm clouds
the crowd goes nuts
the crowd roars angelo behind bundini on one side pacheco and sarria
ali raises his hand and salutes them
ali dances from one end of the ring to the other
dances into georges corner
the crowd roars
dances back to his corner
george is playing prima donna
he wants to make you wait
you wont psyche out muhammad ali with that stuff
instead ali uses the time
he tests the ropes
he gets the feel of the distance between the center and the corner
circles the ring
he looks at the crowd from different angles from the corner the center
he looks up at the lights and gets used to the heat from them
do a shuffle
he feels the canvas
he feels the soft spots
the firm spots
he feels how much slide there is because of the resin on the canvas how much spring there is in the boards
sheds his robe now and throws a blistering array of jabs and hooks
the crowd goes nuts
ali looks ringside and sees
out comes foreman in his red robe archie moore following in his blue pea cap and dick sadler never a fashion plate in the worlds least attractive t shirt followed
by former featherweight champ sandy saddler
is shadowboxing as foreman climbs in the ring and crosses past him near to him
the look on alis face is indifferent
foreman goes immediately to his stool
he doesnt move around the ring
he doesnt touch the ropes
as tall as only three other men foreman ali and bundini walks into the ring wearing black
the referee moves to the center of the ring
a great roar fills the air ali boma ye
ali boma ye
ali boma ye
as ali foreman and both their crews meet in the center of the ring
now both of you know the rules
when i step back i want a good clean break
clayton keeps going no hitting below the belt no kidney punches no
motherfucker you bout to discover you aint nothin
ali be quiet
georges eyes glare
ali rocks back and forth ready to rumble
no kidney punches
past the ref eyeballing george you been hearin about me for years
all your life you been hearin about muhammad ali
now you gotta face me
ali ill disqualify you
now i want a good clean sportsman fight
to foreman you never should have come to africa
foreman is unfazed by all of this
his cold eyes say battery and homicide
blows up all right
beat now go to your corners and come out fighting when you hear the bell and may the best man
ali turns his back and continues to shuffle and shadowbox
corners are clear
ali is facing his corner praying to allah
foreman is bent over at the waist flexing and releasing the last tension in his huge shoulders as the bell for round one clangs
charge out and stop as if they ran into a brick wall five feet from each other
then ali dips throws a left which george takes on the shoulder
a big right hand to georges head
the crowd goes nuts
george clinches picks up ali and swings him through degrees with his power
as he puts ali down ali pushes georges head down and away and ali clocks him with another right
foreman clinches and drives ali back to the rope
ali throws another right that lands
ali dances circles stays out of foremans way
then he slams him again with a right
foreman gets ali in the corner throws vicious combinations and a hook that nails ali in the body and a wild shot hits ali on the side of the head
closer on ali
stunned his eyes clear
hes just taken a foreman shot
he pushes foreman the stronger man out of the way and dances and circles
foreman ties him up again
ali pushes out dances and hits him with a right
ali ties him up and theres the to himself legs heavy
as angelo and bundinis talk fades away
we see alis awareness in a deep concentration
he is holding counsel with himself
ali stares into space across the diagonal to the other corner but not really at foreman
ali is weighing something
he blinks and whatever it is hes decided it now
ambient sound starts to come back as alis attention returns to the present and he ignores
dont let him put you into the corner
stay off the rope
ali charges into the center of the ring provoking foreman to chase him and ali immediately backs to the rope
and stays there
seizing opportunity foreman throws big hooks
ali is doing exactly what hes not supposed to do
he gets off the rope and backs to the rope on the other side
most of the shots are blocked by the gloves of both men
then george throws a left which ali blocks and a big right hook
nevertheless it crashes into his jaw
he ties up george
we see alis hurt
but he must make george believe hes unhurt
that all you got
ali takes vicious hooks to the midsection hangs on and goes right back onto the ropes tying foreman up
georges shots are taken on alis elbows and gloves
but for every four that are thrown one or two tremendous hooks get through to alis ribs his side
reveals impact but nothing diminishes the terrible fortitude with which he endures
now he ties up george
now george drives ali into the corner and pummels him
going crazy in the corner
get off the ropes
get off the ropes
get off the ropes
ali blocking getting hit
worried faces in the crowd
one woman looks away
alive more than alert the sharpest eyes in boxing
ali feints shifts
it misses by a quarter of an inch
ali leans back on the top rope
foremans punch falls short and connects with little effect
thats how good is ali
the techniques become clear
foreman goes upstairs throws three hooks all get taken on alis gloves
foreman slams a hook that began in cape town and ends up in zaire into alis abdomen
ali takes the shots hangs on
are bright like stars
his white mouth guard shines
to himself there is nothin
another foreman hook lands i cannot take
ali pushes foreman off and ali connects with a left and a straight right to the jaw
they pound but dont stop george
ali ties him up
alis jabs end the round
nothing effective but ali shakes his head disapprovingly puts his hand on the back of georges neck and as the bell sounds
thought you was bad
he won the round overwhelmingly
get off the ropes
what are you doin
it gets quiet to himself here come georges murder round
refers to round three ali pushes away from his handlers and rises
he opens his arms to the crowd
we hear a massive ali boma ye start up
opens his arms as if the roar of voices is sunlight
by opening his arms his skin soaks it in and converts it to power
and the bell starts round three
foreman advances ali backs to the ropes tags foreman with a couple of harmless left jabs
now foreman opens up with heavy artillery
ali gets in a couple of shots but for the center of the round hes pummeled by foreman
foreman accepts a left jab and while alis left arm is out with it foreman hammers a right into the exposed lower
midsection of ali and then follows it with six tremendous hooks to alis abdomen
ali pushes him away
foreman comes in again
foreman gets him on the rope again and a surprising right on the left side of alis face
ties up foremans left in the crook of his elbow and they stagger married awkwardly into the center of ring
the referee separates them
charging and throwing heavy shots
ali takes some on his elbows arms biceps and shoulders
now we see ali lean back
we start to hear the twang of the rope
we get it
ali is using the rope as a shock absorber
some foreman punches get through but the rope twangs and foremans hitting a trampoline with a hammer
between deflection and being ring wise ali dilutes much of what george throws
then foreman drives three powerful hooks into alis side
but as if inconsequential
show me something
ali insulting taunting snaps jabs into georges face talking through his mouthpiece
wheres your punch man
ali get off the ropes
off the ropes
blocks a rage of foreman head shots with his fists the abdominal shots within his elbows
each foreman punch is a haymaker
comes from camera and slams right through alis guard right into his jaw
he holds on
off the ropes
dance champ dance
alis pushed back like a rag doll
throws a right hand
it too slams through alis guard
hes in trouble
roll in his head
he sees neon
calmly been here before
distant echoes ali move
beat dance champ
ali glances at the crowd
he sees the old man with the transistor radio on his shoulder from the shantytown urging him on
to himself open the door richard
outta this room
put on your coat man
slams shots into alis kidneys his ribs
ali will piss blood for two months
but ali stays on the ropes
as time to himself think my fights over
to george all you got
that the hardest you hit
ali comes off the rope and ali hits foreman with a terrific three shot combination a right left right
wham wham wham
hits foreman with a left right
its an ali rally at the end
he throws foreman a look of contempt as he walks to his corner
panicked get off the goddamn ropes
took somethin away from him angie that round
you gotta move
stick and move
to himself they dont know whats happenin
ali looks to the left and sees jim brown
to jim brown you bet the wrong horse
he cant fight no better than you can act
jim brown laughs
ali is braced on the ropes as far back as the ropes will go
foreman throws a barrage of shots he slams in five and six at a time
covers with gloves at his head
elbows at his ribs
when head shots come in ali slips them the right or left or turns them into glancing shots or just leans straight back so that they all fall short by
quarter of an inch
covering taking the most powerful hooks foremans thrown in the fight one after the other to the body
to himself take it
terrify him with what you can take
alis eyes are stars
he sees everything
he sees things no one else can see in the quantum physics of deflecting the force of foremans blows
desperate pounds a left to alis side a blocked left to the head three lefts to the belly which get through
alis left arm convulses downwards involuntarily with the blows
what alis not ready for and doesnt block is the right hand that follows
this shot is jarring and concussive
he grabs foremans neck and has to hold on
leaning way back at impossible angles soaking up georges shots
george is slower
but alis not throwing at all
hisses to george eight more rounds
you runnin outta gas
ali comes out from under
five hard shots are followed into foremans puffed face
they surprise and enrage him
drives ali with his pounds
georges arms and fists now swing heavily
some get through
alis right eye is puffy
both tie up
and bell ends the round
angelo and bundini talk
neither we nor ali hear them
to himself to george cant let you get that second wind which you dont know is out there for you
talking to george in his head want the title
wear the heavyweight crown
to himself jaw broke
you ready to die
is that you
towards george cause you gonna meet a man who will die before he let you win
a tall african girl walks by with the number
as she passes near ali she has the audacity to wink at him
ali happens to see it
he winks back at her
he brightens right up
the bell rings
goes to the ropes throws a couple and now comes off the ropes
hes in the center of the ring
a couple of lefts from ali
foreman throws a haymaker and almost falls out of the ring
alis in the corner having avoided the shot
gets in a couple of lefts that ali deflects
ali takes another on the cheek leans way back again
suddenly he seems tired as is foreman
tied up they go diagonally to the other corner of the ring both fighters exhausted leaning against each other
backs ali into the corner
hits foreman with a left
foreman launches a short left that ali counters with a big right cross that connects
head snaps around
sweat sprays in a parabola of light
crowd roars with expectation
george foreman tries a right uppercut fails as ali circles guiding foreman onto the ropes
foremans on the ropes now
know the moment is
to himself now
short chopping right turns foremans head down
comes over the ropes and turns back into
slams his head down and sideways
and foreman charges into ali
snaps a combination an overhead right to foremans face a short chopping left and a right hook
alis eyes light up like white phosphorus
to himself wrestles ali into the center
and the most significant moments begin
and alis left hand is extended way behind him with the wrist bent no power
as it passes his body ali converts it into a left hook
as hes doing this hes dropping his left foot back
the left foot does not support a left hand
its for a right hand so the body can untorque across with the punch
and ali is already cocking his right
meanwhile the left connects with foremans jaw and raises his chin
as the left is departing foremans chin ali launches the right
comes in alis torso untorques transitioning all pounds to alis left foot and putting that weight and power behind his right fist that crashes into george foremans chin
and the impact transfers to foremans skull
and foremans head snaps around
he is gone
he is falling in a spiral
a metaphor for vertigo
turning downward into
and through the spiral ali has moved with him pivoting with the falling foreman his right fist cocked to unload again if he has to
he never does
ali is pushed into the corner by referee zack clayton
foreman is counted out
clayton raises alis hand
people go crazy
ali is seized by rahaman dundee bundini
and in the corner hardly seen by anybody ali now faints
veronica with a don king aide is overcome
tears stream down her face
as if finally released from the suspense the sky opens
the monsoon begins
the city is crazy with the air of liberation in the rain
people are drunk bowing to one another extending their arms and legs in strange gestures
thunder is deafening in the downpour
people celebrate despite the storm dancing on sidewalks on rua absini
the last fans rip down one gigantic image of mobutu
waiting now rise
one in saville row is from a london bank
the other is bradley the usia cia character
the third is idi amin of uganda
as everybody shakes hands they sit down and servants appear
everyone is pleased with themselves
in french ce soir le zaire a ete le sujet central dans le tous les centres europeens
felicitations monsieur le president pour la vie
english translation zaire was the center of the world tonight in every banking capital all over europe
congratulations president for life
then in lingala to servant whats on the menu
rides through the downpour with belinda and bingham in the front seat
she gently holds almost supports his hand
low about them i dont know whats gonna happen
beat maan everything is crazy
i didnt come this far to quit
they drive through a fishing village with dense foliage in part
ali looks sees
have brought their children out into the rain to see the champion so they can say when they grow up they saw him pass by
plastic or clothing protect the children from the rain
one man holds up his son
ali rolls down the window
shouting french to the bartender
folks who look like jim brown schulberg mailer types
hang out half drunk
and argue about flights out with extortionate petty bureaucrats like zairian official
flights have been cancelled tickets rendered no good passports confiscated etc
theres a stoned hunter thompson bill cardoso type with a couple of zairian hookers
the hunter thompson type is not very discreetly smoking congolese weed
king is importuning herbert his hands work the air gesticulating madly building whole castles of hype and hustle
we cant hear what hes saying
then don king stops and looks at him and herbert nods his head yes
then herbert starts saying something and don king nods his head yes
whatevers happening here a deal for the future has been struck
the cold blue light is illuminated with magenta at its base as dawn starts to rise over the congo river
in a pale green shirt and slacks walks towards the water followed by zairians teenagers some kids who snuck into the compound two older men
no media no elite no hype
one policeman who staggers drunk
ali doesnt so much as walk to a destination as amble
he rubs the head of a year old boy who starts shadowboxing five feet in front of him
you think you got a chance chump
now you in trouble
ali begins to spar with the year old who is fast and knows a little bit about boxing
you even dream of beating me
you better wake up and apologize
kid throws a punch
ali collapses to his knees
he too much for me
then ali stands and puts his hand on the boys shoulder
he ambles with the group towards the river
the suns coming up on the other side
