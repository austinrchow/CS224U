written by lucy alibar benh zeitlin based on the stage play juicy and delicious by lucy alibar an abandoned looking trailer sits on top of two foot tall oil drums
distant thunder trembles through the peeling metal panels
the structure is in such disrepair that surely no one lives here
but then a light goes on
a tiny hand sculpts the mud on top of a crawfish hole placed on the floor
we pan up to reveal a little girl examining a baby chicken that appears to be dead
this is hushpuppy an unkempt and seemingly uncared for six year old with a gaze of unmistakable wisdom
hushpuppy places the chick on the crawfish hole like a queen on her throne and the chick twitches to life cheeps twice
hushpuppys esoteric science experiment is interrupted by distant thunder
her eyes stand to attention
an eerie harsh wind whips hay and dust through over a giant slumbering pot belly pig
hushpuppy donned in boys underpants and a child sized wife beater tip toes behind the epic creature
she studies it wonderful is this the source of the thunder
with the utmost delicacy she lays a hand on the pigs belly
we hear his huge beating heart
a series of glimpses of hushpuppys scientific method
she chases geese chickens ducks dogs around the property a cross between an abandoned farm and salvage yard
hushpuppy grabs a baby chick and puts it to her ear
a tiny heartbeat
she listens with focused wonder and intensity
all the time everywhere everythings organs be beatin and squirtin and talkin to each other in ways i cant understand
mosta the time they probably just sayin im hungry or i gotta poop but sometimes they talkin in codes
hushpuppys eyes dart up as a mans voice yells get up get out of here
we hear a yowl as a cat is flung across the room
a window made from a gas station sign opens in a robinson crusoe style tree house patched together from storm debris and discarded appliances
a wild man with severe features a frazz of unkempt hair and brawlers scars opens a window made from a metal sign
this is windell emmett doucet known to all as wink
get your pants on man
wink kills a beer and sends it out the hole in the wall into a basketball hoop attached to a fishing net that stretched feet down to the ground
the net is overflowing with beer cans
hushpuppy obediently climbs a series of increasingly bigger and bigger oil drums that function like a ladder up to the door of her house
we now see wink in his morning ritual
he opens a cooler with a butchered chicken inside it and tosses the bird on the grill
he goes to the front porch and pours down a bag of dog food
he pulls a clothesline that leads to hushpuppys trailer
a feed up time
hushpuppy now wearing pants and a slightly more proper t shirt comes running down the oil barrels to her house
she echoes her daddy
feed up time
hushpuppy devours the whole roast chicken with her hands getting right in there like it was a candy apple
it looks really yummy
pigs dogs chickens and cats are chowing down all around her
a hatch opens above her and we realize were in the bottom of the shacko
wink sticks his head through the hatch and throws corn to the chickens
share with the dogs
hushpuppy rips off a piece of chicken and flings it to a filthy chihuahua with no hair on the back half of its body
this is windell in spite of her circumstances quite a handsome young pup
wide we see hushpuppy and wink drift through the marsh
they ride in a severed truck bed floating on top of oil drums
a motor is strapped to the back
a sign on the boat reads the turck hushpuppys spelling of truck
they look out to where the water goes all the way to a monolithic foot wall stretching infinitely into the distance
this levee the first piece of modern construction weve seen encloses the civilized world protecting it from rising water
the bathtub is on the wrong side of wall
wink stares out at the distant factories behind the wall with a peaceful and confident disdain
hushuppy matches his relaxed defiant expression
aint that ugly over there
he takes a long pull on his beer
we live in the prettiest place on earth
hushpuppy looks over the wall to the dry side
its an endless sprawl of oil processing power plants without a tree or bird in sight
this is the engine that runs the northern world
daddy says up above the levee on the dry side theyre afraid of the water like a bunch of babies
they built the wall that cuts us off
we fly over marsh and water coming upon a tiny crop of shanties on an island perched at the very bottom of the land
they think we all gonna drown down here
but we aint goin nowhere
close on hushpuppy letting out a warrior scream in a mass of hollering people
they stand on a long and crumbling road surrounded on both sides by water
the rag tag band of revelers charge forward whooping and shouting
hushpuppy kisses her hand and smacks the town sign
isle de charles doucet is crossed out and someone has graffitied the bathtub
each party goer repeats hushpuppys kiss and smack in wild ritualistic fashion
the bathtubs got more holidays than the whole rest of the world
the townspeople charge in a rousing parade
everyone drags trails of beer cans boat parts anything they can tie to themselves that makes a lot of noise
they are the hard faces of fishermen and their feisty wives downtrodden but with a sense of fortitude among them a community of heart spirit passion and reckless abandon
we see none of the separations that were used to in modern society
there is no evidence of politics religion class race or any other divisive ideology
the bathtub is a place of true and honest unity
megaphones sticking out a gutted mini van broadcast the cajun band playing inside
fiddle saw guitar and double bass players struggle to hold onto their instruments and the truck bounces them down a dirt road
they drive under a banner reading welcome to the bathtub storm season
wink and hushpuppy rattle along on a float made from the front end of a pickup truck
over the front cabin rears a giants sculpture of a horse head made out of wooden spikes metal plates and heavy chains
carnival dressed maniacs clamber on top
wink hollers and waves to people
he fires jets of beer into the mouths of the crowd
hushpuppy dances on the back of the float
though shes the tiniest member of this very adult parade shes right in the thick of everything
no one is checking i
daddy always saying that up in the dry world they got none of what we got
the town dances around the band in a clearing in the woods
everyone is bouncing to the music smiling and joking with one another
they only got holidays once a year
six babies each with a racing number pinned to their diaper are placed by their enthusiastic mammas at a starting line on a track marked by two adjacent crowds of
bets are flying between the spectators as if theyre about to watch a cock fight
all babies to the race
come up to the starting line
the baby race is about to begin
hushpuppy dances in the cheering crowd swigging a bottle of something she probably shouldnt have
a starting gun fires and the babies make a crawl for it
most of them are paralysed in tears or bewilderment but one brave soul toddles towards victory
they got fish stuck in plastic wrappers they got their babies stuck in carriages and chickens on sticks and all that kind of stuff
hushpuppy looks up at wink who is dancing with his best friend walrus a slack jawed white haired pinked nosed handsome devil
a baby crosses the finish line ahead of the rest victorious
the crowd goes wild
wink opens his trawl net and dumps a massive catch into a picking pan
theres food to feed a hundred in the haul
no one is a bit fazed though this is just your average night fishing in the bathtub
shrimp crabs and small leaping fish struggle over one another for dear life
hushpuppy helps him sort the catch
winkss hands move with virtuosic ease separating the crabs from the shrimp
she studies winks every move and tries to measure up to her dads proficiency
he doesnt demonstrate or explain anything but we sense there is a system of education in place here
hushpuppy focuses in on a tiny fish wriggling and sucking its last breaths of air
one day the storms gonna blow the grounds gonna sink and the waters gonna rise up so high there aint gonna be no bathtub just a whole bunch of water
she pick up a crab pets its belly
the din of the party fades down around her as she listens to its heartbeat
explosions everywhere as bathtubers rampage blasting fireworks down the street instead of into the air
men dressed as women women dressed as men in some kind of reckless esoteric ritual
the score kicks in hard with a tinge of ominous forboding
we sense that in spite of the ecstatic energy the unbridled joy that a cloud hangs over this community
the people are parting like its there last day on earth and we feel viscerally that it could be
hushpuppy runs in the thick of it behind wink waving a fountain sparkler
wink trips and falls
wink lies on his back on the ground
he sees his daughter watching him holding the huge sparkler and they both laugh with sheer joy
hushpuppy stops over him and points a bottle rocket in his face the fuse burning
he nods his approval
they watch the fuse burn down to the last moment
she turns it upward and they watch her rocket join a sky filled with pluming mortars
hushpuppy looks at the light flickering across winks faces
hes momentarily peaceful admiring the spectacular display
hushpuppy smiles at him with pride
he doesnt see her
they run off into the crowd which is pulsating at the pinnacle of mayhem
the ominous music shifts gears into a blasting patriotic hymn of the bathtub
throw your fist in the air
these are the survivors those who fight for their joy and their history to the last man
but me and my daddy we stay right here
we who the earth is for
hushpuppy runs right at us with detonating fireworks in both hands engulfed by light
she swings them toward camera and the screen is engulfed in an inferno of sparks
a white out
black letters slam down
music cuts abruptly as a basket of crawfish is slammed in front of camera
the crawfish squirming and struggling for life engulfs the screen
a fearsome uncompromising leader sexy like a lady bullfighter peeks at hushpuppy over a mass of squirming crawfish
this is miss bathsheba
she points to three students pushing their heads with her finger each time announcing the twelve students follow her through a maze of creatures caged in mason jars basins and
boxes with breathing holes her educational tools
every animal is made out of meat
i am meat yall asses meat
everything is part of the buffet of the universe
miss bathsheba rolls up the leg of her skirt
this here is an aurochs
riding her thigh is tattooed a scene much like a cave painting in lascaux
in thick black ink it depicts a battle between early men wielding spears and giant bull like animals bearing down over them
a fierce mean creature that roamed the earth back when we all lived in caves
they would gobble the cave babies down right in front of their cave parents
and the cavemen couldnt do nothing about it because they were too poor too stupid too small
who here thinks the cavemen were sitting around crying like a buncha pussies
children stare blankly no one raises their hand
hushpuppy watches a heroic crawfish crest the basket fall to the floor and make a run for it
miss bathsheba snatches up the rogue crawdad and flings it back into the vat
yall better think about that
cause any day now the fabric of the universe is coming unraveled
the ice caps gonna melt the waters gonna rise and everything south of the levees going under
she points to a map showing a ragged coastline
on the wrong side of a giant line marked levee is an island labeled the bathtub
aint gonna be no bathtub just a whole bunch of water
yall better learn to survive
a mysterious cold wind fills the air
hushpuppy stares into a wall poster of an ice cliff reading the south pole
way back in the day the aurochs was king of the world
crash cut to the panorama of an ice cliff but now its real
we cut closer to overwhelming white light accompanied by intermittent frozen cracks that build in frequency and volume
if it wasnt for giant snowballs and the iced age
i wouldnt even be hushpuppy i would just be breakfast
the light dims in intensity to reveal frozen deep inside the ice wall barely visible a fanged hairy bloated stone aged creature the same as on miss bathshebas leg
this is an aurochs
hushpuppy climbs a metal ladder made from a railing up to winks shanty in the trees
windell her dirty chihuahua follows behind
feed up time
hushpuppy bangs on the door of the shacko
she goes inside
the house is empty
she checks the shacko for food
several hours later hushpuppy stands on a metal bin looking into the distance
like some sort of animal call she shrieks
hushpuppy draws a picture of wink on a foldout mattress
kids that got no mamma no daddy and nobody
they got to live in the woods and eat grass and steal underpants
hushpuppy lays down next to her drawing of wink
windell the chihuahua and the potbelly pig awake to greet the day
hushpuppy peers into the ground floor of the shacko
if daddy dont get home soon its gonna be time for me to start eating my pets
kids walk home with their parents after a day at the schoolboat which we now see is big a yellow houseboat floating on the bayou
hushpuppy waits alone no one has come to get her
miss bathsheba locks up the door and heads for her small motor boat tied off on the side of the school
you need a ride boo
my daddys coming to pick me up
how about food or something you hungry
hushpuppy shakes her head no
miss bathshebas doesnt totally believe her but shes not the type to coddle either
alright well suit yourself
miss bathsheba motors away
hushpuppy waits until shes out of sight and starts walking
playing dont touch the floor hushpuppy navigates her house
the room has with holes in the walls blocked with old clothes and paper towels
homemade toys fill every surface
this is the domain of a child at loose ends
hushpuppy leaps over her bed a nook piled with clothes and plugs in the christmas lights
everything we still got from mamma we keep in my house
we push in on a shrine to her mother a red basketball jersey
a sawed off shotgun
a childs drawing of a beautiful lady
daddy says the first time she looked at me it made her heart beat so big that she thought it would blow up
thats why she swam away
hushpuppy takes the jersey down
she puts it over a chair in the dining area
hushpuppy gets a can of cat food
water in a bowl
her actions have a sad sense of routine to them shes been left alone before and has her own self invented system for feeding herself
she opens a can of cat food takes it out with her hand and throws it in a pot
she licks the remnants off her finger
hi my sweet baby
marietta hushpuppys imaginary invisible mamma is speaking from the basketball jersey chair
marietta functions like an imaginary friend hushpuppy is the only one who can see her
hushpuppy takes the pot puts it on the stove
hushpuppy what you doing there
you being good like i taught you
hushpuppy turns on the gas
hushpuppy goes through her safety precautions oven mitts a helmet she flips the table and hides behind it
she aims the stove lighter a flame thrower made from a cigarette lighter and a can of spray deodorant
a spray of flames ignites the stove in a fireball
hushpuppy behind the bubbling stove
she ties on an apron and sways to the music
she is dressing like her mom
mariettas voice sings to her
youre good you make me happy youre good you make me happy
thats pretty mamma
youre pretty hushpuppy
hushpuppy stares into the floating islands of cat food frying in fat which in her pov is a surreal churning vision like the bubbling lava at the center of the
shes shocked out of her vision by a yowling cat being flung across the yard
get out of my way you fat animal
hushpuppy jumps down from the stove grabs a bowl of water and runs to greet wink she clambers down the oil drum ladder spilling her water everywhere in her excitement
wink doesnt turn to acknowledge her as he trudges across the field toward his shacko
hes wearing a hospital patients smock and no shoes it seems he checked himself out
i learned lots of stuff while you gone
if i drink all this here i can burp like a man
hushpuppy gulps down water all of it
wink keeps walking
hushpuppy burps like a man but he doesnt turn around
hushpuppy stops to examine the situation
somethings not right here
how come you wearing a dress
hushpuppy tugs his patients smock and he shrugs her off violently
leave me alone man
she sees his hospital i
d bracelet still on
you wearing a bracelet too
go in your house you wouldnt understand
i wanna come in your house
hushpuppy whacks winks butt
wink fakes like hes gonna smack her
hushpuppy tears off
wink storms into the shacko in the backo
hushpuppy stomps inside
her cat food is burning with steam jetting up to the ceiling
she thinks about it for a moment and turns the burner up
hushpuppy grabs her basketball jersey off the chair and jumps over the breakfront counter
behind her a massive grease hushpuppy ducks down panicking
she check over the median
the stove is on engulfed in flames
hushpuppy scrambles under a cardboard box
the walls of the box are decorated with years of her drawings
in here she feels a strange safety
the flames and breaking windows feel distant and muffled
she draws a hieroglyphic of herself sad and crying on an island with a sun and a palm tree
she peeks out as wink runs into the house which is filled with black smoke flickering flames
panicking from inside hushpuppy
hushpuppy where you at
hushpuppy drops the box closed
smoke billows into the box filling it up
if daddy kill me i aint gonna be forgotten im recording my story for the scientists of the future
hushpuppy draws a bigger figure giving her a hug as winks panicked fury intensifies outside
where are you boss
in a million years when kids go to school they gonna know that once there was hushpuppy and she lived with her daddy in the bathtub
wink pulls hushpuppys drawings off the walls he flings them out the door to safety
wink has heard
he looks toward the box
hushpuppy and makes a runs for it flying out the door
dont you run away from me
i swear to god hushpuppy
hushpuppy runs out of winks compound into the woods wink on her trail
in the background the house is a towering inferno
they run deeper into the swamp
im tearing off
you aint tearing off nothin ill bust your ass
im tearing off just like my momma
wink tried to yank her toward home and hushpuppy refuses
she digs her heels in
see what happens
see what happens to you
hushpuppy hooks her leg around a tree and holds on
wink slaps hushpuppy and she falls face down
he looks away disgusted with himself
see what you making me do
youre killing me
he reaches down and tries to pick her up
get up and now come on
hushpuppy jumps up on her own
i hope you do die
and after you die i come to your grave and eat birthday cake all by myself
hushpuppy punches wink in the heart and suddenly everything goes quiet as if all the insects in the forest have hushed
all at once we hear a human heart beating until there is a sonic boom an earsplitting crack of glacial ice
hushpuppy turns toward the sound
when she turns back winks face has transformed wrenches with fear and pain
wink keels over clutching his arm
hushpuppy stares her breath accelerating
winks eyes roll back in his head he begins to seizure
another glacial crack rings out
the splitting builds to a deafening roar
she covers her ears
fissures appear like lightning through the massive ice cliff from the opening of the movie
hushpuppy runs from the sound hands over her ears
we intercut with shots of falling glaciers
the universe is coming unravelled
an ice shelf collapses into the ocean in a massive avalanche a wave rolls toward camera
the wave now just a tiny ripple hits hushpuppys feet
suddenly the water level rises around her
it overtakes her knees and keeps going
hushpuppy backs up to shore terrified
hushpuppy calls out to a distant beacon flashing on the horizon
i think i broke something
hushpuppy runs out of the woods toward school in a total panic
in front of the school parents pile their children into a pickup trucks and vans
my daddy fell down
miss bathsheba takes hushpuppys hands as she tries to catch her breath to speak
clutched in her hand is the hospital bracelet that wink had been wearing
bathsheba turns over the diagnostic bracelet and reads it her eyes widen in recognition and alarm
hushpuppy watches miss bathsheba frantically pull herbs and roots from her containers of medicinal oddities and pack it into a large medicine jar
its gonna be ok baby
bathsheba hands hushpuppy the medicine jar
ok hushpuppy heres what i need you to do
you take this medicine and run as fast as you can
we see glimpses of nature protecting itself from the impending disaster
flowers curl up insects horde food underground rustling sounds fill the air
black birds and bats and all manner of flying creatures fill the sky
theyre all getting the hell out of dodge
hushpuppy quaking with fear runs through a menacing swamp clutching her medicine jar
the rising winds swirl the marsh grass all around her
hushpuppy runs to the spot where wink collapsed
hushpuppy looks around the swamp unable to understand
daddy could have turned into a tree or a bug
there wasnt any way to know
hushpuppy hides her medicine jar in her storage unit a leather flap laid over the hollow of an oak tree
the hollow is filled with trinkets and objects shes collected over the years
hushpuppy flinches as a shrieking animal calls out
she looks up to see a leaf covered in writhing caterpillars
one of them has been skewered by a beetle and is fighting for its life
the whole universe depends on everything fitting together just right
if one piece busts even the smallest piece the entire universe will get busted
blocks of glaciers roll out of the avalanche and away from antarctica like floating ice cubes
embedded in each cube is an aurochs
a single ice cube takes over the frame and the mammoth dead aurochs eye stares right at us
its jaw wide its fangs bared the ferocious beast appears to have fossilized mid pounce
we drift upwards into the cloud cover
as we rise above the white canopy the spiral of a hurricane forms
strings swell under howling winds
we follow behind a little boy running down the road with an alarm bell as the people of the bathtub mobilize in a frenzied evacuation
the storms coming
the storms coming
hushpuppy sulks out of the woods feeling sorry for herself
she looks up and freezes like shes seen a ghost
wink hobbles down the road looking shell shocked
the traffic on the road moves in one direction out
wink walks back into town in the opposite direction
in hushpuppys pov wink arrives at lady jos bar where a band of drunken sweethearts are in their regular positions
they are watching the evacuation go by like its a veterans day parade
they giggle and hurl good natured curses out to a family making their way to safety
look at these assholes running around all over the damn place
cest la vie assholes
i know yall with me
yall doin the storm
lady jos aint never closed honey
thats what im talking about
walrus my big man you staying
wrong number buddy
im outta here as soon as i finish my beer
wink dismisses him with a wave of his hand
you aint goin nowhere
this aint no sneeze comin out the gulf
im gone brother
ill see you tomorrow walrus
lookit there winstons with me
winston is passed out on the stairs
what you doing about the storm winston
without opening his eyes winston raises an umbrella over his head
they burst into a round of drunken applause
where you been
what happened to y shut up
he lifts her up by the britches and carries her away
you dont talk
through the bus window hushpuppy watches wink prepare for the storm as branches and debris fly by him
he rants to himself and drinks
he ties the turck onto the house
hushpuppy looks to where her animals lurch and freeze run around in circles pant heavily
they feel it coming
rain drops start to spatter the window and wink trips and falls trying to catch a fleeing chicken
now the full force of the storm howls and clatters the shutters
rain screams against the corrugated metal roof
wink tapes padding over all sharp corners and plastic wraps the furniture
hes hushpuppy proofing everything
he runs a piece of duct tape across the floor
this side is still winks house
no toys and no girl stuff over here
wink pushes charred toys from hushpuppys house across the line
so if i want to come over that side and smack you in the face thats against the rules
so theres a plus for you
hushpuppy is not able to see the bright side here
now come on down here and get in the boat man
he points to a trunk on the floor
hushpuppy hops down and gets in
wink sits on his air mattress
if the water get real high we gonna float to the top and we gonna bust through the roof and we gonna ride away okay
wink puts a pair of mismatching water wings on her
you never never take these off
im your daddy and you do what i tell you to do because its my job to keep you from dying ok
so sit back and just listen to me
close your eyes and go to sleep
hushpuppy watches wink pretending to sleep
the thunder scares the bejesus out of him again
she looks to the ceiling where water is starting to pour in steadily
looks back at wink who is sneaking a sip from his liquor bottle
he resumes his phony sleep
a strong gust of wind jolts the entire room and he springs out of bed
why you starin at me like that
i cant sleep with you starin at me like that
wink paces the floor
you need to understand youre a kid and im a man
she doesnt understand
what you scared
thunder booms and wink is the one who flinches
dont be scared no storm cant beat no doucet
im gonna show you
but he can see shes still scared
imll show you
we doucets were not scared of no damn storm
wink grabs a bottle of moonshine and climbs down the hatch in the floor into the storm
hushpuppy runs to the window and peeks out
the frenzy of the hurricane propels wink at full sprint through the mph winds
he tears his clothes off and guzzles moonshine as branches fall all around him
look at me
look at me hushpuppy
watch me kick butt
wink fires his shotgun at the heavens
im right here
im right here i aint going nowhere
a thunder clap shakes the house so hard a ceiling beam crashes down
hushpuppy runs to her bed as if it might keep her safe
windell swinging from a basket tied to the ceiling barks panicking herself
still in the rainstorm a glacial cube shatters flopping a mammoth body onto the shoreline
its chest heaves and a low snort is heard
the animal begins to roll over
her dinosaur size hoof plants in the mud as she lifts herself up
we stare over the muscular haunch of her body as she stares into the distance
the massive creature turns testing her limbs after thousands of years of sleep
she looks up to the storm and lets loose a gurgling roar
we sit close on one of her black eyes
there is something dangerously sad in her cold gaze
her head moves from the frame as she starts forward on her journey
the storm has passed
the camera flies high over the bathtub
the tops of houses poke out from the massive water like lily pads in a pond
a slab of metal stares at us surrounded by water
something under the metal bangs twice and an axe dislodges a roof panel
the axe twists and leverages off the slab
wink hefts hushpuppy on top of the roof
dishevelled and hung over he pulls himself up too
the three survivors stare in stunned silence at their new world
wink slowly navigates the turck in through the flooded landscape where their town had once been
neither he nor hushpuppy can say a word
everything is submerged
every organism is dead or has fled
the quiet is overwhelming
for every animal that didnt have a dad to put it in a boat the end of the world already happened
theyre all down below trying to breathe through water
they pass abandoned house after abandoned house the ones on stilts have water up to the porches
trees are bashed through roofs walls are blown through bathrooms exposed
wink uses a pole to open a door
no one answers
they push off
wink enters an intact house with water up to the porch
wink leans against the door frame
from his pov we see hushpuppy on the turck
she picks a leaf and eats it
wink shakes his head in dismay realizing all too clearly his girl is not ready for survival
the turck passes through a net of spanish moss into the belly of a swamp
some day when im gone you gonna be the last man in the bathtub
you have to learn how to feed your house
wink goes to the edge of the turck and sticks his hand in the water
now stick your left hand in this water stick it in there
hushpuppy puts her right hand in the water
ok what you do is you hold your hand steady and you just wait for your fish to come
you gotta ball your fist up this is your punching hand
ball your fist up in case you have to whack it when they come up
wink pulls a catfish out with his bare hand
whooo lord look what we got
say i gotcha
wink slams the fish down on the floor of the turck and pins it
hold him down
now you hold it down like this and whack him good with your fist
wink pins the fish and punches it in the face
go ahead whack him
you whack him good
hold him like that and whack him
hushpuppy pins the fish
she tries to whack it and it cuts her
she hides her cut hand from wink
thats all a part of it
hushpuppy winces in pain
you wanna try it again
hushpuppy shakes her head no trying not to cry
one more time
hushpuppy has enclosed herself under a table with a tablecloth on it
shes drawing on the floor with charcoal
something alive hits the roof and scurries across
we hear the entire house moan or was it a distant roar
winks hacking cough which has gotten worse since last we heard it fills the room
hushpuppy tries to shake him awake
hushpuppy looks through the gap in his shirt
on winks chest surrounding his heart a corroded spider web of purple bruises shows through the skin like varicose veins covering his entire heart
hushpuppys eyes go wide with horror
the beacon pulses on the distant horizon
is that you
the beacon does not respond
ive broken everything
a cloud of dust circulates particles
the haze is blinding
a distant rumbling grows
dark shapes tear through the haze in a deafening stampede
strong animals they know when your hearts are weak
that makes them hungry and they start coming
we see one at first then more join rank around it
the aurochs are charging in a pack
they are a biblical terror the horsemen of the apocalypse
the turck moves through the cypress forest signs are strewn everywhere pointing to lady jos bar
it appears abandoned
suddenly the door squeaks open
walrus winces at the sunlight and pops a beer
he steps out the door and splashes into the water
holy bowlegged sarah
wink pulls in the turck and paddles to rescue the thrashing drunkard
they leverage walrus aboard and lay him out on deck
gauging his surroundings i musta passed out
wink starts chuckling silently
his chuckle builds to a laugh
they enter the bar empty bottles half eaten crabs and general party debris are littered everywhere
little jo is sprawled on the floor under a table
is she dead or just wasted
she awakes with a start and bangs her head on the table
wink and walrus run to help her up
you dont touch me you filthy bastard
wink you get me
they both lift her
goin on all night bout how tonights the last night on earth we gotta make it count
talkin dirty right in front of peter t
sorry peter t
peter t enters from the bathroom
peter t my man
i knew you wasnt gonna leave me man
peter t speaks in his polite level headed soft sweet voice
oh no oh no
re peter t that is one classic dude right there
peter t you are a titan
glad you stayed man
wink jiggles peter ts ample belly
peter t giggles with glee
wink puts one arm around walrus and the other around peter t
he smiles to hushpuppy
she laughs too the first smile in quite some days
the bathtub crew are lolling in the later party stages
there is a rooster on the table looking like the most sober creature in the room by far
if i had wings i know i could have flown in that bad boy
but i would have probably bounced off a tree or
hushpuppy lays on the table in pile of empty crab shells
did i ever tell you the story of your conception
the bar crowd chuckles
when me and hushpuppys mamma first met we was so shy we used to sit around and drink beer and smile at each other
one day we was so shy we just napped
winks voice fades down as hushpuppys fantasy takes over
she closes her eyes
wink younger and prettier naps in an uncharacteristically colorful lawn chair
a low gurgling growl wakes him up
there in the yard crawling slow and lazy is a massive foot alligator breathing the heavy slutty way alligators breathe
a topless woman steps in front
sweat beading on her perfect shoulder blades down her perfect back ending in a pair of boys underpants just like hushpuppys
throughout hushpuppys vision we never see mariettas face its always covered shot from the back or out of frame
marietta cocks the shotgun with one hand terminator style
lowers it on the gator
wink sits up in slow motion her panties and her long naked legs are covered with gator blood
she turns to wink her head above frame
close up on her eye
we follow behind mariettas supple curves as she walks into the kitchen
her white slip is almost see through
back when daddy used to talk about mamma hed say she was so pretty she never even had to turn on the stove
she runs her fingers along the counter and the burners ignite one by one as she passes
she just walk into a room and water start to boil
water starts to bubbles like a spontaneous volcanic eruption
marietta reaches into the frigidaire and pulls out two ice cold beers
ice melts down the bottles
she opens them on the counter flawlessly
she walks over to wink
a hot mess
winks voice fades up
your momma battered that gator up and set it to fry
wink tips his drink
and hushpuppy popped into the universe maybe four minutes later
he empties the glass sufficiently drunk now
i got it under control
wink looks away lost in his own fantasy
over mariettas shoulder beads of sweat form along the strap of her slip
wink looks and meets her eyes
the gaze of a proud and smitten man
grits fall through the chimney vent into the boiling water
dancing like all the invisible particles of the universe
hushpuppy stares hard her face locked in pride and determination
filling with all the strength and heroism of her long lost mother
shes ready to snap into action
energetic music drops and we move in a semi montage through hushpuppys search for survivors
hushpuppy rows the turck through the flooded bathtub by herself
in the distance she sees a lone horse
it stands on an tiny island of land the last high ground in an endless stretch of water
the horse holds hushpuppys gaze
she hears its strong resilient heartbeat
they are one and the same
hushpuppy approaches schoolboat which has weathered the storm relatively intact
hushpuppy opens the door
we hear rustling and whispering inside school
its three little girls left behind in the storm
joy strong a tall wild haired leader lizard a tiny thing in a giant mans tee shirt and t lou the muscle of this girl gang looking very meek in
her desperate condition
the girls are huddled against each other terrified hungry and alone
miss bathsheba shell shocked but steadfast steers the boat toward the bar the four girls now safely in her care
from the inside we hear carousing toasting and raucous cajun wink pours a mountain of crab and shrimp at a great communal table assembled from many different tables
come on lets go
time to eat
come on children feed up time
he sends a feast sliding across the floor under the table where joy t lou and lizard dig in
wink has decorated the bar with all the waterlogged relics of the bathtub
the room is a shrine of peoples chairs umbrellas clothing
were late in the game and the party has descended into utter debauchery
jean raises a glass
to the last of the food
to the last of the water
you aint drinkin no water
miss bathsheba pour shots and toasts
yea tastes like more alright
hushpuppy struggles to peel her shrimps sitting on top of the table
for the ones wed never find we make a funeral the bathtub way with no crying allowed
drunken wink is giving drunken walrus a bath as he eats
when the water goes down im gonna french kiss the dirt
waters not goin down man
nah thats my beautiful place under there
man you know they got plenty of salt coming into that water everything beautiful is gone
trees are gonna dies first then the animals then the fish
i got it under control
hushpuppy picks up a crab
she tries to pound it open tries yanking on a leg
she cant shell it
come on hushpuppy come over here lemme show you how
hushpuppy sits down next to jean a good pupil
you hold like this then you turn it over like that
hushpuppy follows instruction in deep concentration but a bit tentative
we see wink look away from walrus and jos bawdy humor extravaganza and focus in on hushpuppy
his disdain is palpable for this froufrou shelling technique
dont be scared of it now
now you take this knife and you pop this off
jean holds hushpuppys hand and guides a knife to open the belly of the crab
hushpuppy wink pounds the table
and the party falls suddenly silent
wink pushes the utensil away
he grabs a crab opens it in three virtuosic hand motions
grease and spice explode everywhere and wink sucks the face of the crab clean
it is beautiful to watch
he slams a fresh crab in front of hushpuppy
hushpuppy looks to miss bathsheba for guidance
you heard your daddy
hushpuppy pulls on the crab shell with all her might
she doesnt have the power
the kids jump out from under the table and chant
hushpuppy is turning blue her eyes bulge with effort
hushpuppy opens the crab claw and sucks down the meat
everyone goes wild with applause
the kids too
hushpuppy stands up ascending to the top of the table
she lets loose a warrior cry and flexes her muscles deadly triumphant
little jo gets so excited she starts dancing on the table
she cackles and jitterbugs wildly
walrus gets up to join her
jean gets up and dances too
all the kids get up
wink glows with pride
miss bathsheba smiles
you see what kinda family we got
we got feeling
a driving score kicks in as we montage through the transformation of the schoolboat into a ramshackle ark
it wasnt no time to sit around crying like a bunch of pussies
the survivors whittle sticks into spears bend metal debris into spikes
we was gonna build a camp right on top of the bathtub
jean battiste cackling wildly hauls a thrashing goat onto a floating animal pen
chicken coops snake cages a pig pen are stacking precariously
we got enough animals to eat until the water goes down
rafts are lashed to the sides of the school
every floating structure left in town is hauled in and added to the ark
peter t ties on a floating vegetable garden
in wide we see what looks like a small village of floating structures forming
miss bathsheba puts lizards head in her lap lizard is playing as if shes unconscious after hyperventilating
teaching a lesson come here like this
she takes hushpuppys hand and places it on lizards chest
she moves her hand in a circular motion
tee lou get some water
tee lou runs to get a handful of water
quick little circles
good for the heart
joy turns her back
miss bathsheba shakes her head
tee lou returns and pours water on lizards head cooling her
this is most important thing i can ever teach yall
you got to take care of people thats smaller and sweeter than you are
hushpuppy registers this advice takes it to heart
she rubs lizards chest with delicacy and affection
lizards breathing returns to normal and she sits up peacefully
hushpuppy is awestruck
bathsheba gets to her feet
hushpuppy watches wink sleeping
his breathing has gotten worse
she tiptoes up with her red basketball jersey and lays it down on wink tucking him in just right
a distant rumbling is heard
cutting off suddenly as we
a quiet town not unlike the bathtub but with tangled power lines electrical towers and layered hills
a stone flies from behind a house and bounces down the street denting the silence
slowly the peaceful morning transitions into more rumbling a distant crack
suddenly the house in the foreground explodes to smithereens and the head of an aurochs drives through it
without breaking step aurochs maraud the village trampling it into oblivion
we settle close on an aurochs eye emotionless and relentless in its calm
wink hushpuppy and the bathtub crew pole the turck through a lake blanketed with carcasses pushing through the dead fish dead porpoises dead alligator garfish like they were lily pads
there is no wind only dense wet heat searing on the faces of the characters
the once green foliage has gone brown and thirsty
two weeks later everything started to die
to the water come on fishes where yat
wink empties his net nothing but a pile of carcasses
he tips it back into the water
wink pulls himself to the edge and sticks his head under to look for fish
hushpuppy looks at him with an air of doubt for the first time
wink looks ridiculous a dead fish drifts off his head
you wanna leave the bathtub walrus
wink pulls his head back up
i heard that
hushpuppy fidgets guiltily
nobodys leaving the bathtub
you dont know nothing
wink lowers his net back in the water
this water gonna kill us here
we gotta do something bout this
i aint starvin to death while them people go grocery shopping up there
the kids sleep on miss bathsheba in a big pile on the floor
hushpuppy wakes hearing shifting and a snap behind her
peter t is uncapping a shotgun shell and pouring black powder into a small jar
she looks out the window where jean battiste is unhooking a propane container from miss bathshebas burner
he opens her chest freezer and hefts out a foot garfish dropping the container in the water
wink sneaks up and whispers to hushpuppy
boss daddys gotta take care of something
hushpuppy is instantly concerned shes heard this line before and it always leads to trouble
im gonna fix everything back how it was
everything gonna go right back
hell yeah we gonna win
wink pounds his chest in solidarity
hushpuppy matches his pound but without confidence
boss anything go wrong walrus is daddy
wink and hushpuppy look walrus the face of doddering drunken bewilderment
a goat licks him
hushpuppy is not comforted
youre gonna be the king of the bathtub i promise that
wink can see hes getting nowhere
just sit here ill be right back
the door closing wakes miss bathsheba up
she scans the room noticing the three missing people
an unconvincing lie i think they be gone
i i really cant say where
walrus dont make me slap your ass
they go to the levee
walrus is intimidated into silence
you so much as piss on that wall you know what them people gonna do
they gonna smoke us out and stick us in a damn shelter
hushpuppy watches miss bathsheba go for her boat keys
daddy says brave men dont run from their home
hushpuppy scurries out the side window escaping outside before miss bathsheba sees her
wink jean battiste and peter t keep their heads above water as they float under the tarp behind the truck bed
peter t is wearing a life jacket and still has his top hat on
peter t dont hold onto me hold onto the boat
you gonna be fine
jean battiste duct tapes fireworks around the bomb a propane tank with an igniter made from a battery and a pouch of black powder
he inserts the bomb into the stomach cavity of a giant garfish carcass
wink shoves two propane tanks inside the belly of the garfish
he hands a rope attached to the igniter to peter t
peter t you hold the trip line
soft and sweet ok then
just dont pull til i say
you can do it
i have complete faith in you
jean battiste is hesitant
wink gives jean battiste a confident nod
lock and load
jean battiste carefully unravels the string that leads to the fuse
he shoves the igniter down the mouth of the garfish
the turck pulls into an enclosed segment of the levee wink bobs out from under the turck and latches a pre made tether running out of the garfish to a
handle on the wall
he bobs back under the boat
hushpuppy dives under the fishing net on a motor boat just before miss bathsheba charges outside and keys the ignition
hushpuppy peeks out and the boat roars to life and rips across the water
the entire universe depends on everything fitting together just right
if you can fix the broken piece it can all go right back
peter t hand me the he looks peter t has both hands on the turck
peter you didnt drop the trip line
no i did not
peter t thinks a moment
oh yes i did
oh peter t
wink dunks under water
wink surfaces in front of the igniter rope
as he grabs the rope bathshebas snake catcher snares his hand and pulls his arm against the side of her jon boat
heres how we do with wild animals
get off me woman
im trying to save the bathtub hushpuppy watches the struggle in hiding
bathsheba wrenches the rope out of winks hand and chucks it
the igniter rope lands in front of hushpuppy under the net pile
she grabs it
she reels it in
get in the boat
im hauling youre ass back home little boy
jean battiste swims out of hiding
jean battiste get the trip line
suddenly hushpuppy pops out from under the nets holding the rope taught
she stumbles and almost sets if off by accident
she got it
hushpuppy contemplates in an eerie peace
the screaming chorus fades and she is alone in her quiet eyes darting between bathsheba and wink
courage and certainly clench inside her her
you listen to your daddy
she pulls the rope
the trip line releases the detonator
the levee detonates
shattered wood and cement fire towards camera
debris propels hushpuppy backwards
her quiet resumes as she lands on the deck of the boat in slow motion
she watches in a daze as smoke water and flaming dust cycles above her
all the beauty of the universe
water recedes in the bathtub revealing the tragic mud soaked remnants of their paradise
hushpuppy slogs through the muck each step going two feet down into the stinking filth
the crew trudges behind her in silence
the blow up crew crests a hill and sees the remains of the ark sprawled across an open field
winks and hushpuppys eyes well up as they beholds the state of their island
the water has drained
everything is dead
more striking than the ripped up houses the land surrounding the island has disappeared
trees are gone
shards of marsh that had been attached float in the distance
what was a dense green landscape is barren
the bathtub is a scorched hell
hushpuppy picks through the rubble of the shacko in the backo
she finds their grill and a window made from a dryer door and brings them to wink
the shacko has crash landed under the stilts of a house thats been entirely washed away
wink has done some work reassembling the walls and broken parts into a semi functional enclosure
hushpuppy find nails and brings them to wink who leans wall panels against the stilts from the previous house
he hammers nails wearily
his strength is sapped
he hacks out bile
it didnt matter that the water was gone
sometimes you can break something so bad that it cant get put back together
hushpuppy climbs the stairs of the original house to get to the top of the shacko
she looks down through the hole in the floor
in her pov wink climbs into bed he painfully takes his shirt off
the bruise on his chest has extended all the way across his stomach
hushpuppy looks out on the water for some sign that mariettas still with her
the light shining on the water is off
she sees nothing but dead trees and a defunct oil rig
mamma where you at
as if in response we hear a helicopter loudspeaker
this is a mandatory evacuation area you can no longer live here
everyone in this area has to leave
hushpuppy wades through the muck in what used to be a lush forest now reduced to toothpick trees and mud
she finds her storage unit in the tree hollow and lifts out the medicine jar
when youre small you gotta fix what you can
she pours the crushed up roots into winks mouth careful not to disturb him
wink dooesnt move
hushpuppy gently folds in the orange fungus
quiet quiet wink spews up an explosive cloud of medicine
wink grabs her medicine jar and threatens her with it
what you doing
he smashes it against the wall
what the hells wrong with you
hushpuppy is so upset she doesnt know what to do
she screams in anger
raging hushpuppy breaks everything she can get her hands on ruining everything winks reassembled tipping shelves pans walls
she grabs a fishing pole and starts bashing winks grill over and over
you wanna throw things
i can do that too
you want to play that game
lets throw stuff
wink joins in breaking stuff too channeling all his anger into the destruction
wink throws himself into the wall
it breaks off and dumps a series of shelves all over the floor
hushpuppy cant believe it
suddenly its cathartic they start throwing objects at each other and laughing
wink pegs her in the face with a stuffed animal and she grins
hushpuppy throws a pillow
hushpuppy throws a shoe
hushpuppy and wink destroy everything in the house
something goes off in wink chest
he grabs his heart and collapses on the floor
hushpuppy realizes somethings not right
she throws a life jacket at her father
wink continues to force a smile at her
hushpuppy wont return the smile
you think i dont know
hushpuppys bottom lip starts quivering
winks smiles disappears
dont you cry man
dont you cry
he threatens her with a shoe
hushpuppy hides behind an overturned chest
dont cry damn it
wink hangs his head and catches his breath against the wall
he pull himself to his feet and grabs a bottle of moonshine
he sets up two cups on the table
come on get a drink
wink pours hushpuppy a shot
looks suspiciously at her father
wink takes one straight from the bottle
this counts as im sorry for a whole buncha things
you gonna be gone
you gonna leave me alone
i aint gon leave nothing
cause if you be gone i be gone too
hushpuppy that is not how it works
sometimes in the bed i start shaking and cant stop
i got what you got
thats just a side effect of being a stupid little girl
i aint gonna be dead
you gonna live a hundred years more
you know what show me the guns
hushpuppy shoves wink
show me them guns man
wink clears everything off the table with one sweep
show me the guns
hushpuppy flexes her biceps
she begins to chant fierce and guns
guns man give to me
wink holds up his hand to arm wrestle
they scream in tandem as hushpuppy pins him hard
ooooo hushpuppy you the man
who the man
im the man
who the man
im the man
im the man
wink is overcome with love
its too much for him to bear
fuck this table
in a violent euphoria wink grabs the table and hurls it across the room
this scares hushpuppy
she stares silently at her wild animal father longing for something more than rage
wink takes a step toward like hes going to comfort her then stops turning back
i gotta lay down hear
i gotta be strong
dont be scared
wink lays down in the corner
hushpuppy doesnt go to bed she just stands there
hushpuppy waits not backing down
hushpuppy goes to wink
wink pats his heart for her to put her head down on it
a long beat
you aint the one whos sick
she listens to his big huge heart
the aurochs move into a desolate barren wasteland looking exhausted and starved
strong animals got no mercy
cold wind blows them backwards
an old aurochs falls behind the pack
its legs give out and it lays down
its not going to make it
they the type of animals that eats their own mommas and daddies
the aurochs cannibalize their fallen comrade ripping skin and organs in a storm of flesh and gore
the cries of the screaming mother melt together with another sound more mechanical
the sound becomes recognizable as a helicopter propeller
hushpuppy opens her eyes still tucked in winks arm
through the wall she sees four well dressed men
they are out of place like aliens exiting their space ship
she rouses wink he hears the foreign sounding voices and yanks hushpuppy up
he instinctively pulls him and hushpuppy behind the over turned table and grabs a broken chair leg to defend them with
from outside the door this is a mandatory evacuation area
everyone in this region has to leave
wink hurls the chair leg at the intruders as they try to enter
we aint going nowhere
hushpuppy grabs a chair leg as well
its a standoff
three evacuation workers ram the door of little jos house
little jo greets the intruders brandishing a cutting knife and civil war era pistol
you gonna have to shoot me cause im not going
maam were not gonna shoot you
i aint never left here and i wont never will
they get closer
son dont make me cancel your birth certificate
the muscle grabs her by the weapons and in the struggle slam her to the ground
relax relax maam
they drag little jo out of the house
match cut to wink and hushpuppy pinned and being dragged out
get your hands off of her
im gonna kill you
let her go
crash cut to an off white monolithic community center surrounded by a cement parking lot
stressed amateur looking doctors from the real world move in and out of the glass doors
a makeshift sign reads open arms processing center
the interior of the refugee camp is violently fluorescent lit and painted white in an attempt to maintain a facade of sterility
hushpuppy stares at the strange and modern ceiling like theyve descended from another planet
it didnt look like a prison it looked like a fish tank with no water
the bathtub residents walk through the gymnasium which has been converted into a holding tank hospital for refugees
student doctors are examining treating feeding people
the abandoned souls the sick and the old are lined up waiting for assistance
a processed egg patty jiggles weirdly as it hits hushpuppys tray
dont eat that
maloney a clean cut over extended handsome young doctor hustles toward the lunch line
doucet can i have a word with you we found something in your test
its whoa whoa whoa not in front of my kid
wink pulls maloney out of earshot
doucet theres no easy way to say this
hushpuppy struggles to hear more only a couple words come through the din of refugees
require surgery immediately
you need to think about what you want for your daughter
you could die
in hushpuppys pov maloney puts a sympathetic hand on winks shoulder and wink pushes it off violently
maloney puts up his hands in peace and wink shoves him through one of the curtains and is assaulted by a flood of orderlies
i dont need nothing from you
you keep your hands off her
i dont need nothing from yall
let me go
hushpuppy is snatched as she fights to come to his rescue
they tackle wink to the ground
he goes limp as he falls
we track with wink as he comes to consciousness rolling through the cots
he is sedated and being pushed in a wheelchair
he looks through an open door
in winks pov joy tee lou lizard and the rest of bathshebas original school class play in a room with a she tickles hushpuppy who has been given new clothes
and looks like a normal little girl for the first time
her boots and boys underpants have been traded for a delicate blue dress
the image is jarring
hushpuppy needs a hug
i dont want your hug
the babysitter squeezes hushpuppy
hushpuppy tries to squirm away
hushpuppy thats not how nice girls act
say im sorry maam
say it or youre going to corner time
hushpuppys eyes meet winks and she freezes at his horrifying appearance
wink grabs a sofa trying to stop the wheelchair as it rolls by
his fingers slips off too weak to hold on
he tries to scream and nothing but a sedated moan comes out of his mouth
he tries to pull the tubes out of his arm
gently moving winks hand there there sir
hushpuppy stares in shock as wink is wheeled away
hushpuppy watches in hiding as a hand covered in a rubber glove changes the bandage on a surgical scar it looks infected and mishandled
the same hand puts pills in winks mouth
hushpuppy stands over an old man on an artificial respirator
shes creeps closer examining him
she puts her head on his chest
his heart is beating
when an animal gets sick here they plug it into the wall
she whispers in his ear
theyre coming for you
she repeats the process with another vegetable
daddy says if he ever got so old he couldnt drink beer or catch catfish that i had to put him in a boat and set him on fire so
no one could come plug him into the wall
hushpuppy peeks through the curtains at another terminal bed
she sees two orderlies force pills into winks mouth
hes regaining his strength and is able to hold them off momentarily before submitting and going limp
hushpuppy bolts unable to take it
we stay in the room as the orderlies walk away
wink peeks to make sure theyre gone then spits his pills on the floor
wink stares at the ceiling for a long beat
then with a burst of energy he grabs his morphine drip and topples himself onto the floor
he pulls his wires out
hushpuppy lies asleep in a pile with tee lou lizard and joy
wink enters and jostles her awake
where we goin
wink and the girls hustle to the entrance of the refugee center
walrus comes running down the hall pushing peter t on a gurney
wink looks bewildered the rest of the team seems to have their own plan afoot
jean battiste and little jo charge through the cots riling refugees into revolt as the orderlies chase them trying to maintain decorum
everybody get up
dont you want to go home
these people dont care about you
little jo fights off an orderly with a syringe
you live in this hell hole
wink runs the kids toward the bus they pass two busses labeled for salt lake city des moines
wink helps joy tee lou and lizard get on
suddenly winks hand slips out of hushpuppys
he steps away from the evacuating bus
hushpuppy turns and the bus door slams between them
from outside the door make sure you put her somewhere good ok
hes giving her away
he turns to leave
banging on the door no
i aint running
wink walks away from the bus his chest heaving his face clutched in the horror of what hes done
behind him the bus pulls forward then veers violently
hushpuppy charges the driver clawing at her face punching and kicking
let me go
the driver pulls the break and hushpuppy bangs the doors open
she charges wink from behind gives him a diving shove
he topples over
you trying to get rid of me
you trying to get rid of me
why you trying to get rid of me
i aint trying to get rid of you
i cant take care of you no more
yes you can
hushpuppy stares him down accusing
hushpuppys chest heaves up and down
my blood is eating itself
you know what that means
dont be sayin about dying
everybodys daddy dies
not my daddy
yes your daddy
her defiance is broken and the information starts to sink in
it hurts wink as much as it hurts her
i didnt want you to watch that ok
wink doubles over hacking
he coughs horribly
hushpuppy looks down and sees blood spotting the grass dripping from his mouth
the bathtub gangs charges out the door
across the parking lot they go in a spree of euphoria coming to a halt around wink
hushpuppy is trying to drag his limp body across the parking lot
little jo hold hushpuppy away from him
walrus get me home
the bathtub crew carries wink through the entrance to town
his arms slug over walrus and jean battiste hes barely able to help walk
we sense from the weary faces and silent eyes that its been a long journey home
they drag wink through the shacko entrance
everyone goes in except hushpuppy who stops outside the door as they lay him down in convulsions
she stays and tries to watch
wink tries to say something to walrus and cant
blood bubbles out of his mouth
wink catches hushpuppys eye then looks away as fast as he can
reeling but steady hushpuppy backs out the door
hushpuppy walks down the road in an almost eerie state of calm
she takes in the remnants of rusting houses and flipped boats her lifeless ghost town
everybody looses the thing that made them its even how its supposed to be in nature
now with her three friends she tip toes past several humongous footprints up to a gruesome fox carcass
something gigantic has ripped open its stomach and gutted it
she leans over unafraid trying to understand its meaning
flies swarm and nibble their movement almost elegant
seen in close up the gory mess has a strange beauty to it
the brave men stay and watch it happen
they dont run
a sonic boom springs her upright she looks around for the source of the sound
is it an aurochs
she looks towards the muddy bayou
the sonic boom sounds again and the entire body of water quivers with the impact
the beacon blinks out on the water
hushpuppy stares towards it
the children are gathered behind her
something has changed in her eyes
the eerie calm has given way to a hardened determination
though unclear to us her internal path of action is certain
she takes a deep breath and lets out a warrior cry
she runs straight into the water with her girl gang charging behind her
joy tee lou lizard and hushpuppy swim through open water pulling each other forward
they head in the direction of the beacon
they try to kick toward the light but are getting nowhere the current pulls them backwards
we hear a boat horn and they look to where an ancient tug boat with a cabin that towers into the sky like a giraffe head appears through the mist
the girls climb aboard lifting each other onto the deck
they look up to the sound of footsteps on the upper deck
hushpuppy looks up to see sergeant major a big timeless looking man with a salt and pepper moustache saunters up to the rail
he stares down examining these runts with an air of suspicion
im going by my mamma
he smiles broadly as if this was the secret password
him and hushpuppy stare at each other and immediately there is understanding
two lost souls in the wilderness
thats a good place to go
hushpuppy sits adjacent to the sergeant in the tugs elevated wheelhouse
they are two stories up and the white walls create a glow that makes us feel like were almost in another dimension
which way are we going
dont matter baby this boatll take you exactly where you need to be
its just that type of boat
hushpuppy and sergeant major share an ease unlike anyone else weve seen hushpuppy interacted with
the speak like an old teacher with his favorite disciple
they let their silences last
you want a chicken biscuit
hushpuppy shakes her head no
theyre good for you
a deep far away melancholy settles over him
he munches on a chicken biscuit then tosses the wrapper on the floor
the wheelhouse is wall to wall with chicken biscuit wrappers
i been eating these all my life
i keep the wrappers in the boat cause they remind me who i was when i ate each one
the smell make me feel cohesive
i wanna be cohesive
oh you will be i got no doubt in my mind
they let this thought settle then hushpuppy turns her swivel chair back toward the water the beacon appears through the mist
hushpuppys eyes go wide
as they approach another boat comes into view
a half sunken barge that looks as though its been rusting in the same position for a century
as we move in we see a lit up sign elysian fields floating catfish shack girls girls hushpuppy joy tee lou and lizard disembark onto the barge with sergeant major
they circle around a hatch in the floor with light pulsing out of it
far away jazz echoes up from the bowels of the ship
they look to each other in wonder
hushpuppy descends a ladder into a glimmering wonderland
christmas lights swallow the ceiling and a light smoke facade encompasses everything
we feel like were looking at a portal into the past a belloq esque turned new orleans jazz parlor
the regulars are all oil workers wooing their ladies of the night
there is a stage with a dj and two singers karaokeing along with until the real thing comes along by fats waller
the hyperactive miss frankie the matriarch of this establishment comes ahoppin
holy crap you have toddlers
good afternoon miss frankie
well butter my butt and call me a biscuit
how you sergeant major
you need some grits
holy sugar they are so precious
yall just as cute as a tub of puppies
women descend on the kids who recoil not knowing what to do with all this affection
joy strong puts up her fists
hushpuppy pushes through the crowd nonplussed by the flurry of doting ladies
they are not who she is looking for
they are not who she is looking for
she scans pictures of strippers through the ages pasted up all over the ceiling each of them with a bra hung on it none of them right
bar patrons nod and tip their glasses to her as she passes ladies smile and return to their drinks drunk flirtatious dancers giggle at her but she remains unfazed
she reaches two swinging doors that lead to the kitchen
slow motion in hushpuppys pov smoke curls through the swinging doors the light illuminating the dust particles
its a magic kitchen
her pov tilts down to the floor where a pair of well pedicured feet in flip flops walks towards the swinging doors
hushpuppy holds her breath
a gorgeous cook wearing a baseball cap and an apron comes out the double doors
she wipes some sweat off her brow
she watches the band and kills a bottle of ice cold beer
the cook looks down
you need something baby
hushpuppy nods holding her breath
she still cant speak
well whatchu want
shes too stunned too shy to speak
the cook takes stock of the helpless creature in front of her
like a butcher shop owner with a pesky hungry puppy she submits to hushpuppys longing gaze
get in here imll show you a magic trick
hushpuppy follows her into the magic kitchen knocking her head against the swinging doors on her way in
with the smooth fanfare of a circus performer the cook lifts an egg opens a beer bottle with her teeth spits the cap at the egg and it cracks over
hushpuppys face is joy beyond all measure
she watches the cooks flying hands she prepares everything in a single motion its like a dance
she slaps a fresh alligator tail on the table and begins sawing through the scales
lemme tell you somethin when youre a child people tell you that everythings gonna be all hunky dory and all that bullshit but im here to tell you that its
so get that out your head right now
she removes the knife from the gator and aims it at hushpuppy like its a pointer
lifes some big old feast yeah but you
you aint nothin but a stupid little waitress
she scales a gator strips the bones dredges fries
everything you got on your platter gonna fall on the floor and aint nobody gonna be there to pick it up for you
someday its all gonna be on you
she stirs the grits
grits on plate
gator on plate
plate in front of hushpuppy
lemon is squeezed all over everything
so smile girl
hushpuppy tries to crack a grin
she barely remembers how to smile and it comes out all wrong
the cook shakes her head opens another beer on her teeth and heads for the pantry
nobody likes a pity party having ass woman
hushpuppy stays behind staring into the floating particles of dust in the incandescent light stars of the universe
the golden bubbling fry pot lava of the molten core
four perfect gator nuggets are placed next to a sumptuous dollop of grits
the gators magic
hushpuppy looks up from her food hypnosis
encouraging a smile awwwwwwwww
a real smile emerges across hushpuppys face
magic soars as the couples rock back and forth on the dance floor
strippers cradle their dates
its all very sweet and tender
this seems to be the m
o of this strip club slow dance not pole dance
the kids are each dancing with a stripper glowing with love
they are orphans in a heaven of mothers
we float back to hushpuppy the camera dances with her and the cook
the cook squeezes hushpuppy and spins her
each time we catch their face their eyes are wetter and wetter
you can take care of me
me and daddy
after a long beat
the cook shakes her head no
i dont know nothing bout your daddy i cant take care of nobody but myself
this sinks into hushpuppy
you can stay if you want
hushpuppy considers this for a moment squeezes the cook
this is my favorite thing
a far away look has come over her
her mind is somewhere else
i can count all the time ive been lifted
we look up at a face thats slowly coming into focus its wink younger and healthier
i can count all the times ive been lifted on two fingers
he is the first sight of the slimy newborn baby girl tucked in his arm
baby hushpuppy stares up at him as he carries her
bring my baby here
they need to wash her off
naw that waits
baby hushpuppys huge eyed warped facial expression ogles wink
alright fatso breathe some air
they pass through a doorway and sun washes over baby hushpuppy
she smiles and smiles at the world
back in reality hushpuppy gathers herself
shes suddenly not hugging back just being held
i need to go home
hushpuppy cups her hand to the cooks ear and whispers something inaudible
the cook squeezes her tight seeming on the verge of adopting her
but she cant
she spins hushpuppy around and around then puts her down withouth meeting her gaze
hushpuppy watches her disappear into the crowd of swaying couples
all goes quiet and we sit behind hushpuppys head a sea of light like a crown around her
decisively with the force of a charging general hushpuppy turns and runs toward camera
match cut to hushpuppy leading joy tee lou and lizard across a ridge dotted with dead oak trees shes come back to the bathtub
the camera moves over the water past the dead oaks
we turn the corner past a stretch of marsh and come upon the aurochs four of them now suddenly and viscerally in the landscape of the bathtub swimming steadily toward
the bathtub crew sits by winks bed
his eyes are open but everyone is silently waiting for the inevitable
the children crest the ridge
the rumble of aurochs hoofs is suddenly and violently audible
she catches a glimpses of something massive moving behind the distant oaks
the kids turn and hustle down the ridge
hushpuppy joy tee lou and lizard hustle down hill with increased urgency
the distant trampling is growing louder
behind hushpuppy the dark shapes of the aurochs crest the ridge in a deafening stampede
joy tee lou and lizard scream and sprint out in front of hushpuppy
hushpuppy walks steadily forward refusing to run
her face locked with determination she is unafraid
her eyes shoot toward the shacko
wink with all his strength looks toward hushpuppy their eyes meet
in winks pov hushpuppy stops dead on the bridge waiting for her fate staring toward her father
the aurochs bear down on hushpuppy from behind their footsteps rattling the frame
they grow inconceivably large the camera has to tilt to hold the frame
hushpuppy balls her fists and stands her ground
suddenly she turns
the aurochs roars
then inches away from hushpuppy she stops
she snorts blowing hushpuppys hair back
hushpuppy doesnt flinch
the aurochs stares face to face with hushpuppy
wink is frozen in wonder unable to believe his eyes
hushpuppy raises her chin in confident defiance
now in full profile we see the aurochs towering feet tall she takes a step forwards sniffs again
a low snort or is it a purr
the aurochs lowers her head with respect
her eyes well with emotion recognizing one of her own
a ferocious warrior
the aurochs steps back takes a knee and with a belly flop that rattles the very earth she lays down
her three companions follow suit their fat tummies settling into an almost joyful lazy repass
a strange calm has settled over hushpuppy
almost a smile but more of a peace and an affection for her equal
theyre both children in their way
youre my friend kind of
mother aurochs grunts a sentence only hushpuppy can understand
i gotta take care of mine
with weary and clumsy steps the aurochs stand and retreat
hushpuppy approaches the shacko
its like walking the plank but shes unafraid at one with her destiny
the bathtub crew look on her in awe
they part ways to let her pass
she reaches the door steeling her reserve
hushpuppy opens the door
wink is curled up on hushpuppys bed very very thin
his eyes are closed
his chest heaves up and down in short violent breaths
hushpuppy stands and stares
wink looks at hushpuppy in reverence
he knows its the last time
wink motions for her to come closer
hushpuppy inches toward him
it takes all of her might
she sits on his bed
hushpuppy takes her to go container from elysian fields out of a paper bag and pops it
she unwraps a gator nugget dips it in hot sauce and holds it out for wink to take a bite
hushpuppy watches as wink chews weakly
she eats one herself
wink and hushpuppy draw it out
they dont want it to end
it takes a full minute for him to swallow the first bite and she paces herself to finish when he does
winks chest heaves up and down harder and harder
a tear rolls down his face
no crying you hear
she holds them back being tough for her daddy
hushpuppys face hardens and even as the tears fall we see a strength and composure that only wink could have put there
she falls into his arms and he embraces her
hushpuppy squeezes wink
she does not let go
she stays strong
winks hand trembles on her back
she holds him as his deep warm heartbeat slows slows and stops
his weight slumps over her
she keeps on holding him but she knows
steadfast hushpuppy holds a torch on the edge of the bathtub
the turck piled with branches floats in front of her
she lowers the flame and lights a cloth covering winks body aflame
she pushes the funeral pyre out into the current
we watch the boat flames drift into the foreground covering hushpuppy face with flames
she looks into them in all her grief and wisdom
the group begins a funeral prayer playing quiet in the background as hushpuppy contemplates the pyre
as i stand by the bayou everyone else joins him
a ship at my side starts her motors and sails for the gulf
i watch her until she disappears
gone from my eyes thats all
shes just as big as when she left me
and somewhere else other voices are calling out here she comes
and that is dying
they raise their drinks to the sky and shout in unison
hushpuppy gazes into the sparks leaping off the top of the fire are foregrounded in front of hushpuppy particles of wink jumping into the sky
horns enter droning low and building into an funeral dirge
when i relax behind my eyes i see everything that made me flying around in invisible pieces
when i look too hard it goes away but when it all goes quiet i see they are right here
the turck almost disappears over the horizon
the horns take a hopeful turn the melancholy of the dirge mixing with the anthem of the bathtub
i see that im a little piece of a big big universe and that makes things right
hushpuppy stands tiny on the ledge of the earth framed in front of an expanse of endless water
the bathtub gang marches across the marsh road
hands touch the town sign saying goodbye
when i die the scientists of the future they gonna find it all
they gonna know once there was a hushpuppy and she lived with her daddy in the bathtub
we cut wide to reveal that the water is rising and washing over the road
our heroes are marching on the final sliver of land
the camera flies backwards and our view of the road disappears into mist and churning waves
they appear to be walking on water
hushpuppy leads them forward into the future
