href b b alien nation by rochne obannon rewrite by james cameron original screenplay by rockne s
obannon rewrite by james cameron october a long lens shot of a far distant metallic object hovering just above the ground maybe two or three miles away
the heat waves and the light refraction off the desert scape make the object undulate rhythmically keeping its true shape and appearance indistinct
the video camera recording this scene zooms back then pans over revealing a semicircle of us army vehicles and personnel
army engineers with their tripod mounted scopes and binoculars are shoulder to shoulder with the armed infantry
everyone stares off at the same point on the horizon
the video camera movements are handheld unsteady as it moves through the line of army personnel to reveal a second less organized semicircle of observers fifty yards behind the army
locals from nearby towns perch in truck beds and on car roofs budweiser and fritos at hand eyes glued to the distant object
the video camera image climbs up onto the roof of a parked local tv van finds the object again in the distance zooms in and waits like everyone else
abruptly the video image contracts becoming a box chromakeyed behind cnn reporter duncan crais
that was the scene in californias mojave desert three years ago today the historic first view of the newcomer ship upon its dramatic arrival
as with the assassination of john kennedy who among us does not remember exactly where he was that october nineteenth morning when news first broke that people have landed
from another star
we pull back from a large television set to reveal
the hollowpoint lounge a cop bar
the off duty uniformed and plainclothes cops are mostly ignoring the tv except for two detectives fedorchuk and alterez who are waiting for the ball scores
i remember where i was pissing off my balcony at the neighbors dog
yells at crais on tv get to the goddamn ball scores
on the tv screen an on location interview with a cal tech professor comes up
her name and title appear across the bottom of the screen
from the time mankind first gazed up at the stars there had been speculation about a visit by people from out there
how ironic that when that first contact was made the two hundred and sixty thousand occupants aboard the craft were as surprised as we were about their arrival
that they awakened from frozen hibernation to find their malfunctioning autopilot had landed them here by mistake
the cnn reporter duncan crais appears again
these newcomers we soon learned were a genetically engineered race adapted for hard labor in almost any environmental condition
in effect their ship was a slave ship
washed ashore on earth with no way to get back to where they came from
a dishwasher tray filled with beer glasses cuts across frame and we pan with it as it is slammed down on the countertop
now an interview with a fresno housewife standing outside a supermarket comes on the tv screen
when the newcomers were first let out of the ship they were quarantined in a camp not ten miles from the town here
you can imagine how the people around here felt about that
but once they were releases from the camp and we got a chance to know them we saw what nice quiet people they really are
revealing a massive alien figure in a filthy white busboys uniform
his back is to us as he picks up two trays from the counter
the bartender is dwarfed by this newcomer but works around him without apparent concern
fedorchuk addresses the alien busboy
hey henry how you doin tonight
the newcomer turns his face is humanoid but disturbingly alien
you got your green card buddy
you didnt leave home without it
the cops at the bar crack up
henry looks at fedorchuk his eyes carrying no malice
he merely blinks
an explosion of color and movement as opening titles play very quickly
were traveling the streets in a n
sedan getting moving glimpses of the aliens living among us now a coffee shop where aliens eat at some window tables
a newcomer leaving a night school with an armload of books
a city park where a number of alien families have gathered to play some arcane alien game
they call that gang bang a game
a billboard for pepsi featuring an alien
the sedan has pulled to a stop at a red light
suddenly a hand thumps against the glass next to sykes head
and alien hand
its a newcomer derelict standing there weaving mumbling in his own language
in one filthy hand holds a quart carton of milk
we know immediately what he wants
sykes rolls down the window
take a hike
sykes gets a whiff of the derelicts breath as the light changes and the sedan pulls away leaving him in the street
sykes grimaces at the smell
whys it have to be sour milk that these guys get wasted on
what the hells wrong with jack daniels or thunderbird for chrissakes
beat disgusted slagtown
aliens hanging around outside their homes
alien hookers plying their trade
hope their plumbings the same
and sykes gives him a look a newcomer lowrider pulls up beside the slug mobile
an alien couple exit a theater playing terminator an alien wig shop
titles end and we start to pull back into the slug mobile and hear so you gonna go or you not gonna go
the dashboard is littered with fast food detritus and two coffees in styrofoam cups making fog circles on the windshield
a hand picks up one of the coffees and we follow it to a face a forty year old cop face thats seen some wear and tear behind the wheel
is matt sykes
beside him is his partner of nine years bill tuggle
tuggle expertly munches on a slice of pizza as he talks
how can i go
put on your wash and wear suit and your clip on tie have your landlady tie your shoes for you and show up at the church
beat me and carol are going
hey look weve known kristin since
since she was conceived in that cabin up in big bear
you and edie banged the wall so hard me and carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week
goddammit tug i want to see kristin get married okay
but but youre bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing
shit if kristin had to get married where i could afford it wed be holding the reception at buddys burgers
sykes stares out the window wallowing in his pissed off mood
then he spots something that twinges his street cop radar
check it out
through the window tuggle sees what sykes sees two aliens in long coats moving down the sidewalk entering a mom and pop mini mart on the corner
one of them wears dark glasses and a red bandana kipling the other has on a black vinyl raincoat
does that look at all suspicious to you
whatever gave you that idea
sykes continues up a quarter of a block pulls to the curb among other parked cars
sykes is already pulling his gun
tuggle quickly reaches for the radio in the glovebox
this is one henry seven weve got a possible two eleven in progress at porters mini mart corner of court and alvarado
impulsive sykes is already opening his door and climbing out
lets do it partner
tuggle drops the radio mike and follows sykes as the radio dispatcher confirms the call
the two cops guns in hand move along the row of parked cars across the street from the mini mart
through the store window they see the old alien proprietor behind the counter
his eyes go wide as kipling whips back his coat and yanks out a short combat pump shotgun and aims it right at him
the raincoat alien pulls an identical gun and covers the door
sykes and tuggle react to the firepower inside
you got your vest
right in the trunk of the car
yeah thats comforting
through the store window the robbery continues in pantomime
kipling gestures viciously with the shotgun yelling orders in the alien language
the proprietor is quickly filling a paper bag with cash from the register
the proprietors wife a middle aged alien woman stands in the doorway from the back frozen in fear
the raincoat alien dances from foot to foot antsy wired
sykes and tuggle crouch at the car directly across the street from the store entrance
watch the driver
im going for a better angle on the door
i got him
dont get pinned
tuggle leaves the cover provided by the car runs cater corner across the intersection
through the store window sykes sees kipling grab the bag of cash shove it in his coat pocket
bills fall out but he doesnt care
then without warning kipling whips up the twelve gauge and blows a hole in the proprietors chest
the proprietor slams back against the shelves slides to the floor
kipling leans over the counter and fires another round into the proprietor
under his breath aw shit
tuggle is almost across the street when he hears the shots
the human driver of the getaway car parked at the curb a few doors down from the mini mart glances up spots tuggle
he leans on the horn reaches for a machine pistol on the seat next to him
kipling and raincoat alien react to the horn honk
they spot tuggle through the store window and open fire a civilian car enters the intersection
the engine is hit by shotgun fire and the car skids to a stop in the intersection steam rising from the radiator
tuggle dives behind a lamp post
the driver is out of the car now brings up the machine pistol to fire at tuggle
sykes sees this and opens fire at the driver
the driver turns and fires at sykes
sykes ducks down and the car hes hiding behind is sprayed with bullets
a forty foot moving van pulls down the street between sykes and the driver
once the truck is past sykes is standing behind the bullet riddled car gun ready
he rapid fires creaming the human driver
tuggle is pinned down behind the thin lamp post by the shotgun fire from kipling and raincoat alien
get outta there
do you mind
ill cover you
get outta there
sykes rises and runs across the street toward the getaway car firing toward the store as he goes
kipling and raincoat dodge behind cover
tuggle seizes the opportunity jumps from behind the lamp post and runs to the stalled civilian car
he slides across the hood and drops behind the car for cover
tuggle slowly pokes his head up to peer through the car window
his gaze is met by the face of the old man driver who is still inside the car
can i get out now
sykes doesnt have a clear firing line on the aliens in the store
as he considers his next move tuggle fires at the two aliens
they return fire and he slides down to safety behind the car
or so he thinks
glass rains down on him as the car windows are cremated by the shotgun blasts
he flinches as another blast hits the car
he looks over
theres a big exit hole in the fender beside him
the shot went right through the car
another exit hole is blasted inches from his shoulder
panicked he scrambles along the side of the car blasts and exit holes following him until he reaches the front of the car
he has nowhere left to go and a blast comes through the car and catches him squarely in the chest throwing him back onto the street
sykes head jerks around in time to see his partner of nine years blown away
kipling keeps firing in tuggles direction until his shotgun clicks empty
kipling grabs raincoat and throws him toward the back exit of the store
the shotgun falls from raincoats hands
the two of them run out the back
sykes runs to tuggles spread eagled body
one glance is enough
nobody ever looked deader
aw shit tug jesus
he stares shocked and incredulous
he cant find a way to think or feel about this
then we see him going crazy right before our eyes the rage revving
he takes off toward the store as sirens are heard rapidly approaching in background
sykes moves through like a locomotive skidding on broken glass bangs through the exit
sykes catches sight of the two aliens just as they round the corner at the far end of the alley
he takes off quickly cranking up to full speed
sykes rounds the corner
doesnt see them anymore
moves along this street with some caution
lots of shadows lots of hiding places
sykes hears a noise looks up
just in time to see raincoat on a high huge billboard
he cuts loose with the shotgun
huge chunks of the crate he dives behind fly off into the night
sykes on his belly scrambles deeper among the crates
raincoats shotgun clicks empty now
he drops it swings down off the fire escape runs off
sykes is up again in a flash pounding after him
sykes rounds this second corner races down the street
the only route they couldve taken is through a tunnel up ahead
sykes approaches the tunnel all senses wide open
the murkiness of the tunnel engulfs him as he moves through the mouth
he tries to control his breathing so he can hear
the only sound is his own shoes scuffing along the asphalt
then he hears another set of footsteps
rapid footsteps coming toward him echoing
he cant tell from which direction
he spins just as a large shape lunges for him with an alien cry
its the wired raincoat alien
sykes gets his gun up just in time and fires once twice three times
raincoat alien is knocked backwards to the wet asphalt by the blasts
sykes approaches the body slowly
with an inhuman roar the alien snaps forward lunging at sykes with outstretched arms
sykes jumps back startled and fires twice more at the pale figure
raincoat goes down and stays down
sykes relaxes for the briefest moment
then he hears it
a distinctive clicking sound metal on metal
sykes looks up and kipling drops down on him from directly above
sykes goes down in a heap
hes managed to hold onto the gun and as kipling comes for him he swings the gun hand around
kipling sees it lashes out slamming the gun from sykes hand
sykes tries to get to his feet but the alien grabs him and flings him down the tunnel
a siren is heard approaching in background
kipling moves in to deliver the coup de grace
as he draws near sykes hears that distinctive clicking sound again
though his vision is blurred sykes still gets a good look at an exotic silver bracelet on the aliens wrist
the strands of this bracelet are what make the clinking noise
the alien rears back and as he does the approaching siren suddenly wails louder as a backup patrol car swings onto the street heading this way
kipling sees this and leaves sykes running off down the dark tunnel
dazed struggling to rise
we hear running footsteps approaching
sykes turns his eyes wild and unfocused
an out of focus alien face looming over him
sykes whips around in a roundhouse swing with all his weight on it pistoning his fist straight into the alien face
the alien caught by surprise and off balance sprawls backward out of frame
sykes is grabbed by a human uniformed cop as he tries to swing again
take it easy
to alien on the ground you okay
sykes stops struggling and his eyes focus
he looks at the alien he just decked sprawled on his ass ten feet away
the alien is a uniformed cop
his name is jetson
i am all right
he gets up
a trickle of purple blood runs from his nose
i better call in
he moves off
jetson moves toward sykes and the raincoat aliens body
sykes tenses thinking jetson might retaliate in some way
but jetson simply steps past him to kneel beside the dead alien
he checks for a pulse on the underside of the dead aliens upper arm
sykes is holding his punching hand in obvious pain
he struggles to rise
jetson gets an arm around him to help him up
your hand will require attention
sykes roughly jerks himself free of jetsons grip
get the hell away from me
i dont need your goddamn help
he almost loses his balance and has to steady himself against the tunnel wall
sykes leans there the picture of impotent rage and frustration
jetson looks at him with that slight inquisitive expression aliens exhibit when trying to understand human nature
open on tuggles body as the body bag is zipped up over his face and the litter is lifted into the back of the coroners wagon
widen to reveal sykes standing nearby watching
the wagon pulls out and sykes turns moving past all the lapd black and whites and forensics wagons and cops two of them aliens and detectives and rubberneckers some alien
he moves into the crime scene team is checking for prints digging slugs out of the wall photographing everything
several uniformed cops mill around
sykes moves aimlessly around the room like a stranger at a party
the proprietors wife stands near the body in a strange rigid posture a thin mournful keening sound coming from her lips
a harried female uniformed cop is trying to get her away from the body but cant get her to budge
minkler a ballistics guy is tagging the pump shotgun the raincoat alien dropped here
natuzzi a mean looking veteran uniform cop is with him
looks like a standard combat pump action
so what punched holes clear through that car out there
minkler pulls an evidence baggie from his work box
inside are four unfired twelve gauge shells
bri sabot slugs
these puppies are nasty
two plastic sabots fall away in flight leaving a fifty caliber slug going two thousand feet per second
tug might as wellve been hiding behind a rosebush
minkler senses somebody has just stepped up beside him
pretty heavy artillery for knocking over a liquor store
a new voice enters the conversation
an identical round was used in the shooting of a newcomer named hubley two days ago
sykes turns surprised and not especially pleased to see the voice is jetsons
so why the extra fire power
perhaps because even the larger caliber handguns arent always effective against my people
mulls this then you saying theres some connection to this other homicide
before jetson can say the female cop who was talking to the proprietors wife steps up
hey give me a hand with this woman will ya jetson
weve got to get her to division for her statement and she wont budge
to sykes excuse me
and he moves off with his partner
sykes calls after him but jetson is already approaching the woman and doesnt turn
so you think theres a connection or what
the slug mobile pulls up
a drained sykes moves up the walk to his front door
sykes enters his apartment an untidy bachelor place decorated with negative taste
its obviously the maids decade off
by rote he hits the rewind switch on the answering machine on his way into the kitchen
the tape rewinds
he opens the fridge
not much here
left over take out pizza carton
left over take out chinese food cartons
left over take out burger wrappers
the answering machine message begins he glances over his shoulder as he hears his daughters voice
during the following he reaches the fridge
brings out a milk carton thats in his way sets it on the counter
reaches in again and this time brings out a bottle of stoly
then searches for a semi clean glass
bouncy bride to be happy hi daddy its me
im over at dannys parents house
talking about sunday
i thought maybe youd be home by now
anyway uh nothing really
i just wanted to call and say i love you
i love you daddy
she giggles uh oh i shouldnta done that
knowing you youll probably pull this tape out of your machine and save it in that drawer where you keep every card i ever gave you and all of my
old baby teeth
anyway daddy dont save this tape but i do love you and ill talk to you before sunday
beat oh tug and carol came by and met danny last week
sykes stiffens danny thought tug was the greatest but then who doesnt
anyway love you talk to you soon
the machine beeps and hisses
sykes take the glass and the bottle of vodka crosses back toward the living room switching off the answering machine as he goes
then he stops turns back takes the message tape out of the machine and tosses it into a drawer
sykes enters stirring a jumbo coffee
hes slept about four hours and his face looks like he went a few with hagler
he crosses straight to fedorchuks desk
so whatve you got on tuggles killers
jesus sykes its been less than ten hours
me and alterez are on it okay
you dont have squat
you ever try to make a case in slagtown
the list of newcomer informants is about as long as the list of mexican war heroes
nobody talks to nobody down there
half of them dont speak english and the other half only when it suits them
its gonna take some time
yeah i know its gonna take time
like until the ice capades opens in hell with you two on it
across the room the captains door bangs open and captain warner pounds out his deep voice booming through the squad room
nobody wanders off
i got an announcement
get your asses back in here
two detectives on their way out stop and head back into the room
everybody gathers around curious as warner stands holding a sheet of paper
ill make this short
this is a directive from chief evaner who is acting on orders from the mayor who is under mandate from the federal bureau of newcomer relations
as of nine oclock this morning one newcomer uniform officer has been promoted to the rank of detective third grade
the detectives groan
some angrier ones grumble this is bullshit
and weve got him gentleman
more groans volunteers for duty with the new detective should see me in my office
otherwise i will choose a volunteer myself
that is all
he turns and heads back to his office in the wake of continued grumbling from the detectives
sykes standing to one side absently watches warner return to his glass walled office
waiting inside are a balding man and an alien in a grey suit
the alien in the suit is jetson
the grumbling continues around him as sykes considers something
how long has this slag been on the force
a year max right
i dont know about the rest of you but i sure as hell aint gonna sit still for this
im calling the union pronto
meanwhile sykes has decided something
he heads toward warners office
fedorchuk sees this
where the hell is he going
sykes knocks and enters
id like to volunteer for duty with the new detective
warner is surprised
he never expected sykes
detective sergeant sykes this is detective
we have met
warner looks up clocking this
he looks at sykes starting to smell something fishy
the balding man goldrup rises to shake their hands
victor goldrup mayors office
warner is starting to suspect what sykes is up to
to sykes you are to have nothing to do with the investigation into bill tuggles death
you know that
leave that for fedorchuk
nodding departmental policy
to jetson you
theres another case id like to take
a homicide a newcomer named hubley
jetson looks over at sykes knows hes up to something
sykes avoids his look
granger and pitts are already on it
granger and pitts have one hell of a caseload
and i would have thought with jetson here being the first newcomer plainclothes and hubleys body being found over in the newcomer community
dont tell me what to think
hes got a point
thats the sort of thing we should be doing with this early advancement program
long suffering warner looks up at goldrup then finally sighs with resignation
the steel door bangs open and sykes and jetson exit
next to sykes slept in look jetson in his grey suit looks like a jehovahs witness canvasser
they move past all the black and whites pulling out on p
watch during and we work my hours
ill do the driving you do the paperwork
you gotta learn it so you might as well do it all
after a moment sergeant
id like to thank you for what youre doing
then realizing look jetson
get this straight in your head
were not pals were not married and we aint gonna take long moonlight walks together
were just partners
and dont call me sergeant
call me sykes
or matt if you have to
i am george
sykes nods absently and they walk on
four and a half steps to be exact
then it hits sykes
he seizes up cold
wait a minute
hes used to this
sykes cracks up
between laughs man somebody really hung one on you
ive heard some good ones for you guys
humphrey bogart harley davidson
i guess the people at immigration got a little punchy after a while coming up with names for a quarter of a million of you
you werent at the back of the line were you george
my true name is sstangya tssorentsa
you dont mind if i stick to george do you
they approach sykes ugly sedan the slug mobile
anyway whats it matter to you if we think its funny right
whatta you care
that is exactly so
completely deadpan it is like your name
im sure it doesnt bother you at all that it sounds like ssai kss two words in my language which mean excrement and cranium
sykes looks at him perplexed
jetson gets in and slams the door leaving sykes standing there the smirk dropping from his face
theyre cruising along in downtown traffic
jetson is somewhat cramped in the passenger seat
lets talk hubley
refers to a folder he holds his body was discovered three days ago in an alley off of central avenue near downtown
with two bri sabot slugs in the chest
gently correcting him through the chest
rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts
out the window nice signal dickwad
jetson is momentarily thrown by this outburst from sykes
he was employed at the northwest petroleum refinery in torrance
he was manager of the methane facility
he was also a principle partner in a real estate venture to develop low cost housing for newcomers
sykes grimaces at the mention of newcomer housing
a real pillar of the community
beat was hubley missing anything when they found him
was he ripped off
checks file there was no wallet
but he was still wearing a watch and two rings
the guys at the mini mart last night made a half assed stab at the money in the till but i dont think thats what they were there for
i think we got us a couplea executions on our hands george
the murder at the mini mart is not our case
the captain said sykes looks over at jetson pissed
look you want to fit in here right
you want to learn how to get along
well theres a thing about partners about being somebodys partner
you do for each other
and other peoples rules dont mean shit
its the rules set up between the two of you thats all that counts
jetson nods okay
well my friend and partner was shot last night and im after the shitbag that did it
as my partner im asking you to respect me and help me find him
jetson considers this several moments then and as my partner i ask you to respect me and my desire not to break with procedure
sykes stares at him exasperated
without warning he slams the car to a stop right in the middle of heavy traffic puts it in park
jetson who is already a little too close to the dashboard bangs up against it
horns instantly go crazy behind them
what is wrong
very calm nothings wrong
i just want to get something straight
you agree that theres a good chance these two shootings are somehow related right
yelling joins the horns outside
jetson is visibly unsettled by the chaos
yes quite possibly
well would you be willing to accept the theory george that
by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other
does that sound unreasonable to you
no it is not unreasonable
although i great
a relieved sigh well im sure glad thats settled arent you
and with that he puts the car in gear and pulls rapidly out
i think were really starting to click now george hmmm
jetson doesnt know what to think he just holds on
winter a deputy medical examiner human is leading sykes and jetson along the hall
he reads on the fly from a case file in his hand
you know ive been over all this with fedorchuk and alterez this morning
you got nothin better to do cushy county job like yours
they enter briskly through a swinging door
they move among the tables some occupied some not during yeah right
dont push your luck
anyway according to the sheet the guy you nailed outside by the car the human
he was one martin helder
white male twenty seven
wrap sheet shows one armed robbery conviction a couple for sale of a controlled substance
oh yeah and he was wired on coke when you stopped his clock
they have reached a table holding a covered body
winter unceremoniously throws back the cover
there lies the pale naked body of the raincoat alien
have you identified this one
so far hes a john doe
or a sam slag if you like
jetson smiles slightly out of politeness
on him and well you know no fingerprints so it could be tough
your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldnt make a facial match
fedorchuk couldnt find his ass with his hands in his back pockets
jetson nonchalantly looks over the alien body while winter and sykes continue talking off to one side
referring to raincoat alien you took this gut out too didnt you
lucky for you you got him in both of his
well what we loosely refer to as
i had to empty my damn gun into him
thats the way these people are
you dont hit both pumps you just piss them off
during this jetson has turned the dead aliens hand over sees something that brings a frown of curiosity to his face
he leans closer examining the palm carefully
then he peels back the aliens upper lip
jetson frowns anew with concern this time
he looks around spots a newcomer lab assistant nearby bentner
jetson motions him over
jetson begins questioning him using the alien language
sykes and winter nearby remain oblivious
oh heres an extra headshot if you need one
hands sykes a polariod of dead aliens face were just about to start cutting in
youre welcome to stick around if you want
its really fascinating stuff
yeah ill bet
sykes looks over now noticing jetson and bentner in earnest conversation
he only catches snatches of the alien language
bentner appears very unsettled by what jetson is telling him
in response to jetsons final statement bentner nods as if agreeing to do something jetson has requested
sykes goes over to jetson
whats going on
really suspicious now nothing
looking away shouldnt we examine their personal effects
jetson moves off leaving sykes there wondering
two large plastic packets are dumped of their contents onto a formica counter
sykes looks through the dead aliens effects while jetson goes through the humans
ortiz the college girl working the property counter sits nearby doing homework
jetson holds up a little foil packet with a puzzled frown
what is this
looks then a rubber
coney island whitefish
jetson doesnt know what one is men human men put them on their uh penises to protect against having babies
jetson still doesnt get it sykes turns to ortiz you need this for anything
nope got my own
anything you guys dont use gets stuffed away in storage
sykes tears open the packet unrolls the condom dangles it before jetson
get the picture
frowning and that fits
yeah its rubber
and still it fits
sykes looks at jetsons serious expression
he tosses the condom and packet back into the counter and continues searching
a beat then he cant stop himself he steals a glance at jetsons crotch
still searching sykes picks up one of the dead aliens well worn heavy work boots
the sides and soles are painted with a viscous black substance
he very tentatively sniffs it
and is grateful that its not what he thought it might be
what is this stuff
sykes gets some on his hands doesnt know where to wipe it
jetson glances over
it is a resin
sykes looks at him
surprised that he knows
continuing newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks
how the hell do you know that
a large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us
my spouses brother is one
so the slag theyre cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like hubley worked at a refinery
beat id say that possible connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible
beat okay next step i gotta go talk to the wife of the slag store owner blown away last night
i believe i should interview the widow alone
why the hell
realizes its because of his lack of bedside manner great fine
you talk to the wife
the shattered windows have been covered with plywood
through the open doorway we see jetson talking to the proprietors wife
she studies a photo jetson shows her nods her head speaking rapidly in the alien language
sykes drives along beside the mammoth steaming network of buildings and pipes that make up the refinery
through the loud and smoky refinery we see sykes walking with the newly promoted methane section manager oneal in tie and shirtsleeves
the workmen around them are both human and newcomer
yelling over the roar mr
hubley was an all right guy and a damn good manager
the men liked him
im really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes
well one of the men didnt like him so much
they stop and sykes hands oneal the polariod photo of raincoat alien
they have stopped near the heavy refrigeration type door leading to the methane section
newcomer workers move in and out through the door during looking at photo you think this is the guy who did it
we think he coulda been involved yeah
you know him
to be honest its hard to say
i hate to admit it but they all still kinda look alike to me
impatient who else can i ask around here
looking at photo again wait
you know who it looks like
he isnt in today
he took the afternoon off
i think youre gonna find hes taken the rest of his life off
sykes notices the door to the methane section
that where anderson worked
yes it is
some alien workers come through the door thirty five percent pure methane gas in there
i dont know how these fellas do it
sykes watches two more alien workers pass back through the door
oneal watches sykes expression for signs of suspicion
we see sykes hand oneal a card then move off
oneal watches him briefly then crosses to some steps and starts up this way
we pan with him as he enters a door here on the second level
oneal enters moves to a telephone begins to dial
beyond is a glass wall overlooking the methane section
camera tracks through the methane section
past the alien workers in lab whites
past all the arcane equipment and chemical procedures
ending in an extreme close up of a small cylindrical dispenser as it fills slowly with a pale blue viscous liquid
were shooting through the slug mobile window as sykes pulls up in front of jetsons modest but immaculately maintained home on the outskirts of slagtown
jetsons wife an attractive alien woman stands watering the lawn with a garden hose
jetsons son age six rides his bicycle along the walkway
jetson dressed in his suit for work crouches near the walkway playing with his son
sykes pulls the car toward the curb rolls his eyes
welcome back ozzie and harriet
he honks the horn
jetson looks up then moves to his wife and kisses her goodbye
moves to his son kisses him on the top of his head
sykes watches all this
and as he does slowly his derisive expression softens
as corny as this tableau may be theres something very appealing about the innocence of it
even to an unrepentant cynic like sykes
jetson starts to climb into the car and we close on an alien hand as it removes one of the drug dispensers from a tuxedo pocket
as the hand brings the dispenser toward the face we immediately recognize the exotic silver bracelet worn by kipling the night before
it makes that distinctive clinking noise
we pan with the hand to reveal kiplings face
sans bandana and sunglasses now
he wears a black tuxedo
he lets a small dab of the blue gel curl from the dispenser onto his tongue
and reacts as the rush from the drug hits him
the door to the mens room bangs open and a middle aged politico enters obviously drunk
kipling quickly pockets the dispenser moves past the politico to the exit
sykes drives heading for the biltmore hotel
porter is not taking her husbands death well
impatient did you learn anything
a week ago two men came to see her husband
after they left he was very frightened
she identified one of the men from a photo i showed her
it was hubley
what about the other guy
she didnt know him
but she said her son might
did you talk to him
he has not been home since that day
but she told me where to find him
the men are in tuxedos the women in evening gowns
only two of three newcomers faces present
kipling threads his way among the tables as the mayor at the speakers platform addresses the assembly
our guest speaker tonight has done so much in his community and for his community in such a short period of time
and i must say as the founder of the first newcomer owned and operated corporation in southern california he certainly has come quite far in the last few years
granted not as far as he came in the years before reaching los angeles
there is laughter from the vips
kipling slides into a seat at one of the front tables
he leans over and whispers something into the ear of the person seated to his right
we see this close up and dont see who he is whispering to yet
whoever it is nods
continuing as mayor of this city it gives me great pleasure to introduce someone who has so readily made our city his home
and all of us who live here his friends
ladies and gentlemen william harcourt
the vips applaud as the spotlight sweeps over to a front table
at first it hits kipling then it adjusts to capture william harcourt seated to kiplings right
harcourt is an exemplar of the successful newcomer entrepreneur
handsome charming with cool blue eyes that glint with his piercing intellect
he rises smiling warmly steps past his striking alien date seated to his right to make his way to the podium
he shields his eyes somewhat from the bright spotlight
once behind the podium he slips his notes from a breast pocket as the applause ebbs
thank you all for that very warm reception
pauses smiles im particularly grateful because i actually had the gall to write that in my notes thank you all for that very warm reception
imagine how embarrassed i wouldve been if it hadnt have been such a warm reception
the vips laugh
hes won them over instantly with his charm and candor
sykes followed by a reluctant jetson bears down on harcourt who is exiting the hotel with his date and kipling
we see kipling recognize sykes from their fight two nights before
but because kipling looks so different sykes doesnt recognize him outright
still during this sykes senses something though hes not sure what
im sergeant sykes and this is detective jetson los angeles police department
nodding greeting sergeant
i wasnt aware there were any newcomers at the rank of detective yet
i am the first
this is my administrative assistant rudyard kipling
throw away rudyard kipling
to harcourt listen we just need a minute of your time
wed like to ask you about a business associate of your warren hubley
yes i heard about poor warren
you were partners with him on some slag uh newcomer real estate thing
he and i along with seven or eight others
listen gentlemen i will be happy to assist you in any way i can unfortunately at the moment im overdue at another function
suddenly theres a voice from o
harcourt turns as the mayor and his wife step up
william i was wondering if you wouldnt rather ride with luisa and me
two limousines trying to make it across town in all this traffic were bound to be later than we already are
ray i wonder if you know two of your police officers
detective jetson and sykes
shaking their hands dismissively a pleasure
to harcourt we really should be going
the wind is knocked from sykes sails by the presence of the mayor with a very impatient expression
continuing please feel free to call my office monday morning for an appointment
to jetson congratulations again on your promotion detective
youre out there setting an example in our community
ill be keeping an eye on you
harcourt is smiling as he says this last but his eyes are penetrating
telegraphing a subliminal warning
harcourt and entourage move off
leaving sykes steaming
walking behind the others
they speak in very low voices harcourt continuing to nod and smile to other passing vips during that cop the human he was the one who killed anderson and the
this is becoming a serious breach of security
he didnt recognize me
it is his new partner that im worried about
maffet the stocky retired cop behind the counter hands jetson a bag of reloads and some silhouette targets
sykes nods to jetson motioning him toward the firing line
go on ahead
ill be right in
to maffet low whatd you dig up for me
maffet slides open a drawer takes out a paper bag containing a massive pistol with an enormous bore
by his manner this deal is definitely not kosher
sykes hefts the weapon
you said you wanted the biggest thing i could find
well this is it
what is it
youre talking twice the impact energy of
magnum hot loads
flips open cylinder only holds five
yeah the shells are too big for six in an cylinder
hell matt you dont need but one
jetson looking bizarre in his ear protectors is taking careful aim with his
as sykes walks up
jetson slips the protectors down
well lets see what you got cochise
gimme six rapid fire
jetson a little nervous at this command performance turns sets and fires at the silhouette target
its a large sloppy grouping
continuing how long you been shooting
whattya gonna do if somebody draws down on you wave your scores on the written exam at em
sykes starts loading the thumb sized bullets into the casull
why did you do it
whyd i do what
agree to work with me
you dont like me
you dont like any of us
you have nothing but contempt for us
and yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner
my partner is dead
because one of you bastards killed him then disappeared into a rathole down in slagtown where hes home and dry cause nobody sees nothing nobody says nothing
sykes grabs a bullet proof vest from nearby slaps it onto the hanging target form
he hits the switch running the target down to the end of the lane
continuing but he didnt figure on you george
youre going to get me through that wall of silence
youre going to make them talk to me
youre going to help me find that slag son of a bitch
and if fedorchuk and the boys in the bullpen dont like it screw them
and if the captain doesnt like it screw him
and if all the slags down in slagtown dont like it
well screw them too
sykes raises the casull fires
the shell rockets clean through the bullet proof vest on the target form
the recoil slams sykes back jerks his arm up
again and another hole is drilled through the vest
other shooters look over
sykes sets the gun down
sees his hand is bleeding
jetson absorbs all this as we a violet neon x fills frame flashing hypnotically
its a bar catering to rough trade newcomer clientele
several alien men brute laborer types lounge around out front
they glare with antagonism as sykes and jetson climb out of their car
to jetson okay just stay back and do what i do
watch and learn watch and learn
sykes and jetson walk into the almost total blackness of this all newcomer place
a few near infrared indigo lamps dot the blackness
i cant see dick in here
we can dimly make out booths along one wall some tables and the bar
there are maybe twenty figures seated or standing in the darkness
the room falls silent in a wave as sykes presence becomes noticed
sykes saunters forward commanding the space with his unhurried movements
calling into the dark silence which onea you slags is porter
from the back of the bar who wants to know
sykes squints into the darkness then aside to jetson who said that
tilts his head to indicate at the end of the bar
sykes nods starts in that direction
my name is sykes
im ssai kss
the whole place roars with laughter
too late sykes remembers what his name sounds like to them
he continues down the bar and a figure in one of the booths sticks his leg out and trips sykes with his size work boot
sykes stumbles then recovers and pivots on the offender
hoots and derisive laughter
he sees only shadows
merely a voice in the dark careful ssloka you might hurt yourself
sykes gives the darkness where the offender sits a hard stare then turns and shoulders his way to the end of the bar
sykes stops behind a big newcomer in greasy work clothes
the punk newcomer in the next seat is keeping his head down trying to be inconspicuous
he glances over at the two cops
his expression shifting to recognition as he spots jetson
sykes speaks to the big newcomers back
the big newcomer continues to sip his mug of sour milk
sykes grabs him by the shoulder and turns him around
the alien grabs sykes hand off rising to his full height
he and sykes lock eyes
the punk newcomer porter has started to slip away unnoticed
jetson spots him reaches out with one arm and grabs him by the jacket
i believe this is the one you want
he pulls porter back into play
now jetson sees porters face
and he too reacts with recognition
sykes gives jetson a sour look releases the big newcomer and turns his malice on the punk newcomer
your name wouldnt happen to be porter would it
over his shoulder to jetson back off george
but i know this man
ill handle it
jetson backs off letting him handle it
to porter jesus are the questions too tough for you already
lets try again slowly is your name porter
to jetson whats that
back to porter screw me
that cant be right
sskya ta ssloka
sstrokya sslato na
to sykes low you dont want to know
your mother mates out of season
to porter thats very colorful
but see now ive got a problem
i dont seem to be getting much cooperation from you porter
so i guess were gonna have to take this little session down to my office ya know
and instantly sykes whips out this flashlight snaps on the beam and arcs it into the faces of the aliens around him
jetson gets a blast of it too
the aliens are momentarily blinded
sykes has porter pinned to the bar the flashlight in his face as he starts to handcuff him
but porter gets a hand free and crushes the head of the flashlight
along with sykes expression of satisfaction
porter hurls sykes back slamming him into a table
the crowd hoots and cheers
sykes finds his way to his feet
matthew you dont have to do this
he charges porter brandishing the flashlight like a club
the two of them battle then sykes sees his opportunity and brings his knee up viciously into the aliens groin
porter doubles over in feigned agony then slowly rises again smiling
dont they teach you anything about us in cop school little ssloka
porter grabs sykes by the shirt front is about to deliver a crushing blow when another arm cuts into frame locking with porters blocking the punch
it is jetson
eyeing jetson sstangya tssorentsa
youre a cop
with some contempt it fits you
jetson says something to him in the alien language
porter gives him a hard stare then moves toward the back exit
sykes stumbles over to jetson
you know that guy
nods from quarantine when my people first arrived here
he and i were housed together
how could a straight arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him
in the camps we were lodged four to a room
the selection process was entirely random
we did not get to stay with our friends
and he moves toward the back exit
sykes watches him go
porter leans against an alley wall
he speaks english learned on the streets
you dont know what your father and these two men were arguing about
i told you i was in the back of the store
i just heard voices muffled like
one of the two men was hubley right
what about the other one
did you know him
i seen him around
high roller dude named strader
runs a club on the west side
yeah i heard of it
thats all i know
you want anything more you ask somebody else
he pushes away from the wall heads for the door to the bar
i am sorry about your father
porter throws him a look over his shoulder then disappears through the door
sykes and jetson start down the alley
if i may make a suggestion
we have different weak spots than you do
next time a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm here will produce the effect i think you were looking for
i knew that
the wall mounted menu is in english and the alien language
the servers are teen aged humans and aliens
sykes and jetson stand at the counter awaiting their order
serving them six forty two
they both put money on the counter
the kid goes to put the order together
sykes looks at the alien characters on the menu
i dont think i could ever learn to read that shit
beat how long did it take you to learn english
off sykes look we learn quickly
it is our strength
what we were bred for to adapt to hostile environments
the serving kid puts their bags on the counter
continuing thank you
they take the bags and walk off digging the food out of the bags as they talk my neighbors kid has a newcomer girl in his class
shes six years old and in seventh grade already
they climb into the car
jetson doesnt respond
some things are better left unaddressed
meanwhile sykes has unwrapped his food and recoils in disgust
i think i got yours here
he holds up two strips of raw meat with patches of animal fur still on them
jetson meanwhile is grimacing at the dripping cheeseburger hes just unwrapped
they quickly trade
continuing which one is that
eating a strip this is mole
winces watching him chew would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two
our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked
jetson looks over at him smiling
oh thats real attractive
you got fur in your teeth george
come on man were gonna be talking to people
sykes looks at his burger his appetite gone shoves it back into the sack and tosses it into the back seat
as sykes pulls onto the street
so what was that other word for human
it means literally small but intelligent creature
sykes looks over doesnt know if he likes this it loses much in the translation
and what was that one about my mother
that was a good one
sstrokya sslato na
yeah thats it
say it slow
jetson pronounces the words and sykes follows along haltingly
after several tries he can say it passably well
an upscale mostly yuppie human dance club
the antithesis of the x bar
a human hostess in a slit dress has just finished seating sykes and jetson at a table
she moves off
the two cops look up at the stage
revealing the exotic alien dancer named cassandra
she moves with a feline blend of strength and grace
framing her face is a silvery nylon wig that she tosses like a mane as she undulates to the music
sykes watches with fascination
the music ends and cassandra steps down from the stage to be replaced by a human dancer as the next song cranks up
sykes and jetson quickly intercept her as she heads backstage
you are cassandra
we are with the police department
this is sergeant sykes and i am laughing ssai kss
were looking for your boss strader
she eyes the two of them warily then moves backstage assuming they will follow
she moves along the narrow corridor
hes not here
why ask me
the young woman at the front said you might know where he is
she did did she
well she was wrong
excuse me i have to change
she moves through a door
sykes follows closely so does jetson
cassandra grabs some clothes and goes into a stall
look were not here doing an interview for the school paper
this is a homicide investigation
and if you dont stop jerkin us around im ready to start playin hardball
jetson has waited politely half in half out of the room
sykes rapidly motions to him to go look around
jetson mimes back huh
slipping out of her dance costume oooh
that sounds interesting
are you going to strike me
you could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me
ive got my own ropes
still miming to jetson does that cost extra or you throw them in
youve got me all wrong
i dont charge money for something that i myself find pleasurable
finally jetson gets what sykes is trying to tell him
he says in the uncertain stagy voice of a bad liar i am going out to the car
i will meet you there
sykes rolls his eyes as jetson exits into the corridor
cassandra emerges from the stall wearing a long stylish low cut dress
look i dont know where mr
strader might be
he comes and he goes
starting to feel a little uncomfortable the girl out front mentioned straders assistant somebody named watson
maybe he knows
tensing slightly todd
todd doesnt know either
she is very close to sykes now
she fingers the lapel of his jacket
continuing i know
why dont you hang around for a while let me entertain you
its matt right
now tell me the truth have you ever
with one of us
not unless i got real drunk and nobody told me about it later
i find that very arousing
music drifts up from downstairs
jetson moves along the corridor scoping things out
he tries a door
tries another one
he eases it wider then enters the darkened office
jetson moves into the office
makes his way to the cluttered desk top
pushes things around
all the usual stuff
he starts to turn away then his eye catches something sticking out from behind a row of ledger books
he reaches for it
a small dispenser of the kind we saw being filled at the refinery
jetson studies it his suspicions growing
opening it he finds only the barest trace of a viscous substance
he smells it
not enough to tell for certain what it is
but enough that he is very concerned about what it could be
cassandra is practically melting herself into sykes now
she takes his hand and guides his fingertips over her facial ridges
she shudders with pleasure
sykes begins to perspire
theres lots of things i havent done but his aint high on the list
dont take it personally
i think youre just a little scared now about what you might find once the lights go out
a little scared
and a lot curious
maybe more than you want to admit
but doesnt that turn you on that curiosity and fear swirling together
coos think of it as broadening your horizons
i like my horizons narrow
pressing herself into him your voice is saying no but your body is saying yes
he quickly disengages from her
my voice body and everything else is saying ill be back in two hours for strader and he better damn well be here
he shoves a business card at her then retreats through the door
sykes closes the door and lets out his breath
cassandras expression instantly turns to worry and she quickly crosses to a phone and punches the intercom button
jetson looking through a desk drawer hears the intercom buzz in the next room
through the wall tentatively yes
over the intercom breathless todd its me
the police were just here
looking for strader
and asking about you
jetson moves toward the door to the adjoining office drawing his gun
the floor squeaks beneath his feet
he looks down then continues toward the door
jetson eases open the door
its the managers private office
jetson sees the phone receiver resting on the desk the desk lamp on a lit cigarette in an ashtray but no one behind the desk
jetson eases through the door and a chair crashes down on him from behind the door
jetson goes down his gun skittering out of his hand
jetson and his assailant battle in the well appointed office
sykes hears the fight through the private office door
he throws the door open
sykes stands in the doorway the casull straight armed at jetsons assailant
the assailant does
he looks at sykes scared breathing hard
hes a newcomer in a snappy armani suit
this is todd watson
jetson on the floor starts to rise
suddenly somebody flies at sykes from the side knocking him sideways down the corridor
watson seizes the moment and shoves the off balance jetson into some furniture and dives for the door
watson runs down the corridor ducking onto a fire escape
meanwhile sykes wrestles with cassandra
shes as strong as he is but he has the edge in experience
jetson disheveled appears in the private office doorway ready to chase watson but not knowing which way he went
struggling with cassandra fire escape
end of the hall
jetson nods takes off down the corridor
sykes manges to get one handcuff on cassandras wrist the other cuff around a pipe sticking out of the wall
she screeches at him in the alien language as he collects the casull and charges down the corridor
jetson pounds down the fire escape
below him he sees watson reach the ground and take off running for the parking area
jetson reaches the ground and gives chase
watson zig zags through the parked cars jetson cutting down other rows trying to make up the distance between them
sykes bangs down the fire escape leaping the last fifteen feet to the ground
watson reaches his alfa romeo yanks open the door fires it up
jetson slides up ten feet behind the car pulls his gun aims
the white reverse lights flash on
jetson stands there gun aimed but he hesitates to shoot
in that split second hesitation watson floors it
jetson jumping to avoid being hit
watson throws the car into drive looks up and sees sykes standing right in front of the car
he hits the gas
sykes has no choice then to leap onto the hood of the car
watson with sykes face on the other side of the glass panics and plows the alfa into some parked cars
sykes is up in a flash yanks watson out of the car
watson rears back to swing at sykes when sykes swings his arms around in two wide arcs his fists landing two direct hits in the nerve centers under watsons arms
watson folds over with a ooowwph sound and drops to his knees
breathing hard ill be damned
sees jetson run up howd you like that huh
dropped him like a bag of cement
jetson picks up watsons fallen wallet
he looks at the who is he
the assistant manager
watson is still doubled over just trying to draw one agonized breath
i dont believe this
look at my suit
look at what you made me do to my car
laughing your girlfriend put up a better fight than you did pal
we are looking for your employer joshua strader
hes out of town
why did you run
because you two were chasing me
we were chasing you because you ran you dumb son of a bitch
when will strader return
hes the boss he doesnt have to check in with me
this is my partner heres first coupla days and he wants to make a good impression
me though the way i feel this could be my last day know what i mean
and im ready to rain on you like a cow pissin on a flat rock
strader hasnt been around for a coupla days
he didnt tell me where he was going or when hed be back
i swear it
to jetson what do you think
i believe he is probably lying
through his ass
to watson next time you see him tell him to call me
unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes
sykes shoves a business card in watsons breast pocket
they walk away and watson slumps against his car
as they walk wearily to the slug mobile
george you can handle the women from now on you mind
watson is alone surveying the damage to his alfa when he hears footsteps
he turns with a what now
expression and a shotgun butt is slammed into his forehead
he goes down
kipling stands over him flanked by four human thugs
one of these is quint senior human in harcourts employ
to other thugs okay scrape him up
harcourts private limo glides down the narrow access road passing a lookout car attended by two alien thugs
the limo moves down to the beach parking near an n
harcourt exits the limo walks onto the sand to the back of the van
here he finds kipling and quint and the three human thugs
they have watson chained to the vans rear bumper facing the sea and have been working him over with a tire iron
hes bruised and bloody but still conscious
my arms gettin tired and so far zip
he is ssverdlatya ssalo to strader
whats that mean
his allegiance to strader is above pain or life
you tellin me this guy would die before hed screw his boss and work for us
nobodys that dumb
it is something you couldnt comprehend quint
harcourt approaches watson kneels beside him careful to keep the knee of his designer pants out of the sand
i understand you have been resisting my offer mr
your sense of duty to mr
strader is noble but no longer an issue im afraid
harcourt signals and the two thugs drag an alien body from the back if the van a middle aged alien strader shot twice through the front of his silk suit
watsons eyes widen in fear
continuing i will not make this offer again
i want you to work for me to manage the nightclub as straders successor
if you do you will know a wealth and comfort our people never dared imagine
watson stares at harcourt scared but defiant
harcourt studies watson a moment perhaps even admiring his resolve
then it is such a pity to die for an outmoded value
quint i believe its time for our friends swimming lesson
watson freaks out howling and lashing against the chains
to watson its important to learn new skills
essential to your growth as a person
quint and the thugs free watson from the bumper
he bucks and lunges as they drag him toward the surf
quint addresses one of the thugs a new guy
you never seen this before have you billy
oh man you aint gonna believe it
seawater is like battery acid to these guys
i dont know what it is some kinds chemical reaction
whatta you think it is watson
whoa hold him
a wave breaks outside the foam rolls in what i love about the surf is you can never tell how far up its going to come until it
whoops got a little wet there
the wave just sloshes over watsons lower legs
flailing one of his hands dips below the surface of the water
he howls and yanks out his hand
we see the alien hand dripping seawater
then a thousand droplets of purple alien blood begin to bead all over the hand
the thugs get watson swinging
last call sucker
watson is flung into the surf
harcourt and kipling have walked down almost to the waterline
we hear watsons gurgles and screams
kipling is very nervous this close to the water
harcourt seems unperturbed
when we picked him up he was talking to those two cops the two who came to question you about hubley
this is getting out of hand
i want you to deal with it
a wave rushes up the sand
kipling quickly steps back
harcourt stands firm staring it down and the foam stops six inches from his dress shoes
continuing we must learn to embrace the things we fear
and from that grow strong
a moment then he turns and starts back toward the limo
he motions to straders body and the surf
the thugs grab the body and heave it into the waves
jetson is talking rapidly in the alien language on the kitchen wall phone
sykes foreground takes the bottle of vodka from the refrigerator throws some ice in a glass pours himself a shot
as jetson is talking he spots the carton of milk that sykes inadvertently left out of the refrigerator two nights ago
he sniffs it
his eyebrows do an involuntary movement
he finishes with his wife and hangs up
he watches sykes take a long pull on the vodka
holds up milk carton would you mind
sykes shrugs tosses him a glass
jetson pours the semi lumpy milk and takes a big swallow
then indicates phone so she keeps you on a pretty short leash does she
she worries about me
sykes leans against the counter getting comfortable his voice more weary then bitter
i know the routine
you are married
we mate for life
is a strange concept to us
its like having an eleventh finger removed
it hurts like hell but you never really needed the damn thing in the first place
jetson nods even though he doesnt really understand this
jetson gazes around
your home is quite disordered
i thought perhaps you had been burglarized when i walked in
growling i appreciate your honesty george
he smacks his glass against jetsons
sykes has his wallet out
showing jetson a dog eared photo
ignore the bitch on the left thats edie
i call her edi amin
this is kristin my daughter
its kinda an old picture
shes twenty now
getting married in fact
jetson sitting across the table from sykes looks at the proffered photo
theyre both a little drunk now
human children can be very beautiful
then getting married
you will be taking sunday off then
uneasy maybe not
i dont know
im not sure im gonna go
mumbles she doesnt need her burn out of a father there
jetson looks at him
sees something he never thought possible in sykes
trying to break the melancholy mood jetson reaches for his wallet
upbeat i must show you
flips open wallet shows four crisp photos of his wife and this is richard
hes four years old
we named him after the former president richard nixon
sykes looks at all the photos sprawled out on the table
and has to laugh
he looks up at jetsons sincere face
he may be starting to like this guy
you open to a piece of advice
tell people you named him after richard burton the actor
just take my word for it
and he clacks his glass against jetsons sitting on the table and they are quite a bit drunker
jetson has doffed his jacket and tie leans in listening intently to sykes
and so and so the doctor says if this is the thermometer then whered i leave the pen
laughs raucously jetson doesnt react youre not
you dont think thats funny
george work with me i always get a laugh with that one
look if the doctors got the thermometer in his hand then wheres his pen gotta be
straight faced in the other mans rectum
laughing sticking out of his ass
see thats what makes it a joke
theres like a surprise and your mind fills in the funny picture
heres this guy with a pen stuck in his ass and he thinks its a thermometer
jetson just blinks nada huh
jetson shrugs apologetically
sykes pours them each another round
continuing your health
they clack glasses and the party has moves into the living room floor around the coffee table
its a quieter moment
there is so much our two peoples dont understand about each other
no shit holmes
youre only from another goddamn planet for chrissakes
you humans are very curious to us
you invite us to live among you in an atmosphere of equality weve never known before
you lay before us a beautiful green world full of freedoms and opportunities
you give us ownership of our lives for the first time
and you ask no more of us than you do of yourselves to live by the rules
rules that arent made to keep one people subordinate to another but rules that exist to preserve equality
you aspire to very high ideals here
sykes is watching jetson mesmerized
the guys never said this much at one time before
if he wasnt drunk jetson would never let himself open up to a human like this
continuing i hope you can understand how special your world is
how unique a people you humans are
so it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves
dont count on me george
i never had any ideals
jetson smiles a little
he knows thats bullshit
we dont understand the hatred the contempt
but we must bear it
we must not react in anger
because our situation here is still fragile
the separationists would see us returned to the quarantine camps
the fundamentalists say we have no more human rights than dogs or cats
but the prejudice we face here is so insignificant compared to the pain that weve known before
and that is why we are so grateful
sykes studies him a long time through heavy lidded eyes
finally yeah well
except i did hear you eat your dead
jetson looks at him a long beat then deadpan only on fridays
sykes stares at him for about five seconds and then explodes with laughter
you son of a bitch
jetson stands unsteadily and announces im going home
yeah go home
get some sleep
you do sleep dont you
jetson going out the front door just waves over his shoulder without turning around
what a wildman
sykes stands there wobbling then he collapses backward onto the sofa unconscious
and we match dissolve to the first hues of dawn stream through the window
sykes remains passed out on the sofa where we left him
the slug mobile parked at the curb
silence then the rumble of a heavy truck
and a tow truck turns onto this street at the corner
the tow truck glides to the curb in front of the slug mobile
the driver stays inside as his passenger alights carrying a tool kit and a paper bag
the human is quint
quint uses a slim jim to open the slug mobile door then slides behind the wheel
quint slides the contents from the paper bag
it is a packet of c plastic explosives with a primer cap and two lead wires with their ends bared
quint bends down starts to work under the dash
as his head disappears from frame suddenly another head appears above the seats
george jetson sitting up groggily in the back seat
a blanket slips off his head and shoulders
he sits there blinking rubbing his eyes feeling lousy
under the dash quint starts to whistle as he works
jetson with a puzzled expression leans forward and sees this guy in the front seat
before he can jump start his brain quint sits up sees him and hammers him in the face with his fist
jetson is knocked back holding his face
that was the last thing he needed
meanwhile quint is shouting and bailing out of the car
he runs and leaps into the already moving tow truck
it is sliding around the corner out of sight just as jetson stumbles out of the car
he whips out his gun from the unfamiliar shoulder rig and it flies out of his hand
jetson sags against the side of the car mumbles an alien phrase clearly the equivalent of fuck it
sykes is in the fetal position on the couch where we left him
someone is pounding on the door
he regains consciousness reluctantly
this better be good news or money
he shambles to the door and gets it open admitting jetson
jetson holds the c charge in a handkerchief with one hand and gives it to sykes
lurching to the sink i feel very terrible
sykes registers what hes holding
he moves to jetson who is running his head under the tap
whered you get this
a man a human was wiring it to your car
i didnt get a good look at him
then registering that its day panicked i must call my wife
jetson is starting to take on sykes looks his clothing rumpled and a day old
sykes has showered and changed so hes not suffering as much by comparison
they approach sykes desk
shes going to divorce me
george shes not gonna divorce you
you mate for life remember
shes very progressive
im certain shes considering it
distributing phone slips nearby notices sykes
you guys are looking for somebody named strader right
fedorchuk and alterez just phoned in
they found him
sykes and jetson react or at least whats left of him washed up on the beach at zuma
sykes and jetson react again
continuing handing over the message slip theyre still there if you wanna catch them
she moves off
well lets roll george
with a stricken expression to the
to the beach
come on lets go dude
crane shot nice and wide showing the slug mobile turning off p
onto a gravel road which curves down the the beach
the following is v
as the car approaches the water
stop the car
please i must get out here
come on you wont have to get near the water
stop the car
we see the car pull to a stop in a cloud of dust
all right okay
keep your pantyhose on
jeez when in doubt freak out for chrissake
sykes sees that his partner is covered with a sudden sheen of sweat his hands shaking
continuing its all right george
just wait here all right
ill be back in a coupla minutes
he climbs out and sykes drives down to the beach
toward a cluster of vehicles a sheriffs black and white a coroners wagon and fedorchuks unmarked sedan
a quick glimpse of a pile of dark yuck in the shape of a person black and skeletal beneath the remains of a silk suit
wound around the corpse are streamers of kelp and other high tide detritus
looking down at the body
a coroners technician is doing a closer inspection
found his wallet in his jacket pocket
joshua strader big as life
jesus what a mess
its gonna be a bear to make a positive determination but it looks to me like he was shot before being tossed in the drink
at least twice indicates where hearts wouldve been on the body here and here
sykes absorbs this
he rises along with fedorchuk and alterez
howre you two doing on tuggles killer
the store owners son is in a street gang so now were thinking maybe its gang related
yeah thats real good
you guys follow up on that for a coupla months
fedorchuk looks up at jetson standing on the bluff above
look at your dildo partner
hes too scared to even come down to the sand
calls up to jetson even though hes too far away to hear youre not gonna get wet standing here moron
id like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid fedorchuk
see how much surfin youd do
alterez shoots a polaroid of the body
sykes grabs it as it emerges from the camera and walks back toward the car
fedorchuk flips him the bird
as sykes rounds the car he sees that someone has drawn on the door in yellow liquid chalk marker a big star with e
printed inside it
sykes looks around
fedorchuk and the others stand together chuckling conspicuously not looking in his direction
sykes has stopped to pick jetson up
hes wiping the e
from the door as jetson approaches from the edge of the bluff
fedorchuk pulls up alongside in his n
he calls off to jetson who is still twenty yards away
well if it isnt detective jetson
forget you hip waders big guy
lay off asshole
i may be an asshole but at least im a real detective not some outer shit space thing
sykes his face neutral which we should by now know to be highly dangerous saunters to fedorchuks car and leans against it
youre a real honest to god detective
sykes grabs the back of fedorchuks head and slams it into the steering wheel bam honk
and in doing so has hurt his hand again the hand he hit jetson with
he shakes that hand while lunging in and grabbing fedorchuks car keys with the other
continuing then detect these
fedorchuk holding his bloody nose watches as his car keys sail out in an arc out over the bluff
jetson just climbing into the slug mobile witnesses the last of this scene without knowing how it began
sykes gets in slams the door
his hand hurts as he grabs the wheel
he holds the wheel gingerly as he slams the car into gear and hurls gravel up the road toward p
jetson looks over curious
what was that about
embarrassed that he defended jetson nothing
on jetsons confused expression we a different burger stand
sykes and jetson sit across from each other at one of the outdoor tables
sykes with his greasy burger jetson with his mole strips
this time they have no trouble eating in front of each other as they talk
so weve got three guys dead
all newcomers all killed the same way execution style
warren hubley was in middle management at a refinery
joshua strader operated a successful bar and nightclub
and porter ran a piece of shit mom and pop mini mart
beat so what the hells the connection
sykes and jetson enter the cluttered lab office
winter is here eating take out chicken at his cluttered desk
you guys finished the postmortem on strader yet
his mouth full you mean the blob
theyre finishing up now
is bentner here
i must speak with him
he went home early his kid was sick
continuing yeah but he left something for you
he wipes his greasy fingers on a napkin then finds an envelope on the desk and hands it to jetson
jetson tears open the sealed envelope
the message inside is written in the alien language
continuing does this have something to do with the test he ran that he wouldnt tell me about
his expression grows stricken as he reads the message
getting very curious and suspicious now what kind of test
looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day
did he find anything
winter shrugs indicates the message jetson reads as if to say maybe it says in there
to jetson well
jetson refolds the paper and puts it in his pocket
he is clearly disturbed by what he has read
he looks at sykes a moment then quickly breaks eye contact
it is nothing
jetson quickly moves off
sykes hurries off after him
sykes hurries to catch up with the fast walking jetson
they eventually reach the elevators and jetson jabs the button during whats this nothing shit
it wasnt nothing yesterday when you asked bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits and its not nothing now
dont lie to me george youre bad at it
distant closed you must leave me alone on this
the elevator arrives he steps in
they enter the empty elevator
jetson presses the button to descend
no see i dont leave you alone
im your partner
i dont work that way
tug didnt work that way
jetson remains steadfast
sykes about to explode slams his palm against the red emergency stop button and the elevator lurches to a halt between floors
continuing no secrets goddammit
you dont hold back from me
whatever is going on youre gonna tell me now
i cannot involve you
this is not your concern
the hell it isnt when somebody wires up enough c explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist
beat that slag was on something and not sour milk either
am i right
he has backed jetson to the wall by sheer force of will tell me
what is it
finally it is called ssjabroka
to us it is a potent narcotic
like your cocaine i suppose
the high lasts several hours
we would receive small amounts of it
as a reward for our labor
youve taken it
we all did
where did he get it
was there any of it on the ship
i am sure not
that is why i am so concerned
someone must now be producing it here
emphatically but none of my people know how to make it
the process was carefully guarded
as the enormity sinks in jesus this is major
then why didnt you tell me sooner
whyd you hold out on me
your people dont know about this part of out past
and they cant know it would threaten our entire existence here
the voltage runs out of sykes
he seems to understand jetsons dilemma
look me in the eye
george you dont ever lie to me again
i must trust you matthew
i cannot stop this without you
sykes stare at jetson
absorbing the enormity of the earth shattering secret this alien has asked him to keep
sykes and jetson move quickly to the slug mobile
sykes reaches for the drivers door handle with his punching hand
he winces in pain
the son of a bitch still hurts
he looks across at jetson opening the passenger door
how about you drive
jetson looks over at him
gently reacting to this vote of confidence
they walk quickly around to the opposite doors climb in
sykes and jetson move down this government building corridor
theres gotta be some other connection
they enter a door marked bureau of newcomer affairs
high shot showing the maze of partitioned cubicles filling this huge room
its all but deserted
sykes and jetson are off to one side with a heavyset woman human computer operator who theyre shanghaied into helping them after hours
she sits at her computer terminal
sykes and jetson stand behind her as she types in commands and information
she types hubley warren
the computer screen flashes past various information then settles on a screen full of information of hubley warren
scanning it left quarantine on november thirtieth relocated first to riverside then moved to los angeles early in february the following year
field of expertise chemical manufacturing
looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery
try joshua strader will ya darlin
for you anything
the operator punches up strader joshua
the screen fills with information
continuing reading from screen released on november twenty ninth
came immediately to l
ten weeks after arriving he took over the abandoned club which is now encounters
to operator now the store owner please
she types it in
released december one
he and his wife moved first to modesto then coalinga california wherever that is settled in l
field of expertise organic chemical engineering
he and his wife have one child a son
yeah we met him
close personal friend of georges here
im sorry matt
nothing here seems to be matching up
but sykes wasnt listening
hes starting off
an idea forming
he stands there a moment considering it his face looking like hes chewing something sour
its so off the wall it takes a moment for him to assimilate it
then holy shit
to jetson look what were staring at three newcomers with nothing in common right
what if its just one other guy who killed these three
jetson looks at him blankly three and one make four
of totally different backgrounds
jetson still doesnt get it you and the store owners son that punker
suddenly the realization hits jetson too
he looks at sykes
sykes spins to the operator excited
can you dig up their quarantine records in this thing
just a minute
she moves up a screen to the top of porters information
to herself porter was in lodge seven seven two
she rapidly types in additional information
the screen shifts as she jumps files
finally she gets a line that reads enter lodge number she types
sykes and jetson lean in as the screen goes blank
then information flashes past as the computer searches
then finally occupants quarantine lodge hubley sykes and jetson react their hunch is coming true
on the computer screen
sykes and jetson their faces bathed in the green kick of the screen stare without blinking waiting for that forth name
on the computer screen
reacting to the name
close on a limousine door as it opens and a tall figure rises from the back seat
we tilt up to reveal william harcourt
we move with him as he walks to the n
van from the beach scene parked in front of the limousine
kipling is just sliding out of the passenger side of the cab
quint exits the driver door
kipling slides open the vans side panel reaches in for a large black suitcase
he slides it out
he and kipling start into the club followed by quint
the club is deserted tonight as harcourt and entourage move toward the back
harcourt and the others move up the stairs to the second floor
cassandra wearing a slinky dress is at the top of the stairs waiting for them
shes very uncomfortable dealing with harcourt
kipling and quint continue on toward the office door
harcourt pauses with cassandra
he touches her neckline of her dress letting his fingers linger against her flesh
best what is your name again
flinching involuntarily at his touch cassandra
a chilling smile i will have to remember that
he continues down toward the office door
cassandra watches him go
they had months in quarantine to develop the plan
porter with his chemistry background must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug
hubley manufactured it at the refinery
strader through the nightclub established a distribution network
and harcourt harcourt was the brain who brought it all together
the slug mobile skids to a stop at the loading dock entrance
sykes and jetson climb out
they hop up onto the loading platform and move purposefully into the well lit interior through the open door
it is saturday night the plant is barely operational only a few workers around
sykes and jetson move purposefully toward the back
okay george we gotta play this real smart
if the drug is here we must destroy it
no george youre missing the point
the drug is evidence
we need to have the evidence ya know
jetson doesnt reply hes focused beyond what sykes is saying
sykes spots oneal up ahead by the refrigeration door to the methane section
continuing thats the guy
oneal recognizes sykes and doesnt wait around for the big newcomer bearing down on him
he dodges quickly through the refrigeration door and swings it closed
jetsons hand hits the door an instant later before it is latched and he pushes it open despite oneals body weight against the other side
jetson grabs oneal by the collar and drags him deeper into the deserted room
hey what are you crazy
you cant come in here like this
sykes reaches the doorway stops and stares
so much for playing it smart
oneals feet are barely touching the ground as jetson moves along the row of drug manufacturing equipment
finally he reaches a stainless steel tub
he runs a long finger along the inside comes up with some residue of the drug
it glistens blue on his finger
it holds him mesmerized for several moments
his expression that of a former junkie beholding the stuff he used to covet so
tentatively stepping closer is that it
a beat than jetson explodes he sweeps a rack of equipment off the worktable savagely wipes the drug from his hand onto oneals shirt front as he slams and pins
the bug eyed oneal to the wall
in oneals face where is the drug
where have they taken it
choking what drug
this is an oil refinery you
pushing harder unable to breathe you
youre gonna break his little chest bones
stay out of this matthew
to oneal tell me where the drug has been taken or i will crush your lungs against this wall
oneal is experiencing real fear now
sykes has decided to back jetson up for better or worse
he takes the good cop role
dont piss him off oneal
when he gets like this i cant control him
ive seen this before
he got like this once i saw him jerk a guys spine out and show it to him
nothing i could do
i hadda go throw up
at length with great effort they took the stuff out all of it this afternoon
about fifty kilos
and some street grade
jetson reacts to this
then increases the pressure
oneal is really in bad trouble now
even sykes takes a half step forward thinking jetson might actually crush this man
where have they taken it
finally jetson eases off
oneal slumps to the floor gasping for air
this time jetson is the juggernaut
his expression set and hard
as he strides to the car
sykes practically has to run to keep up
george cmon lighten up
its a beauty of a case
dont sweat it we got him by the short hairs
he aint gonna make any more of the shit
the fifty kilos matthew
i have to find it
i cant let it get out on the street
whats the big goddamn deal
jetson has reached the drivers door of the slug mobile yanks it open
continuing as jetson starts the car you destroy that drug you destroy the case
dont blow the whole thing now by not following procedure
through the open drivers window fuck procedure
and to sykes shock he throws the car in gear and peels out
jetson accelerates toward the security gate
the guard in the shack starts yelling and runs out as the slug mobile bashes through the barricade bar
sykes stands there like a moron with no partner no car
a pickup truck carrying a worker just getting off his shift starts ambling past
sykes runs in front of it waving his badge
the pickup skids to a stop
i need this thing
the poor guy bails out and sykes jumps in jamming it into gear
the truck has seen better days
it doesnt have much power to give as sykes floors it toward the exit
as jetson races along the freeway whipping past other traffic
he takes a hand off the wheel reaches over and pops open the glovebox
he shoves some maps and garbage aside reaches deeper inside for something we dont see what
cassandra walks a trio of well dressed drug dealers two alien one human through the deserted club
she leads them to the office door opens it then lets them enter ahead of her
a couple of them smile at her lasciviously as they brush past
she is about to enter herself when an alien hand flashes in behind her covering her mouth pulling her backward away from the door
it is jetson
he had been hiding behind some crates stacked here in the corridor
he pins cassandra powerfully to the wall keeping one hand over her mouth
she struggles until she sees who it is
i am here to take harcourt
where is he
she hesitates then decides to cooperate indicates with a nod toward the office door
pulling his gun show me
the large suitcase rests on the expansive conference table
a manicured alien hand reaches in and slowly opens it
inside are fifty one kilo glass tubes full of the viscous blue drug
also several of the small individual dispensers
it is harcourt standing behind the table in a pool of light who has opened the suitcase
he is flanked by kipling
with quint elsewhere in the room
the room is lit by track light creating pools of light and dark
the two alien dealers eyes widen at the sight of the drug
the human dealer doesnt know what it is
to alien dealers its been a long time hasnt it gentlemen
what is it
a sweet indulgence from out past
resurrected for our future
harcourt sees the hungering expressions on the alien dealers faces
he slides one of the dispensers from the suitcase
continuing to alien dealers please feel free to sample the quality
the experience will be everything you remember it to be
one of the alien dealers takes the dispenser brings it to his tongue
the other alien dealer turns to harcourt whered you get it
i arranged to spend some time with three very resourceful men
with a certain amount of coaxing one of them was able to reconstitute the formula for me
beat they worked very well together
unfortunately they are no longer with us
but i was fortunate enough to reap the benefit of their endeavor
he indicates the drug
the first alien dealer sways gently enjoying the sensation
the second alien dealer takes his hit
shudders as the first rush washes over him
the human dealer is no fool
he grabs the dispenser
let me try some
he does immediately spits it out jesus
tastes like detergent
and thats all the effect it will have on you
but when my fellow newcomers learn they can obtain it here they will work very hard
to make as much money as they can
to give it to me
suddenly a voice from the shadows near the open door to the other office you havent told him all of it
harcourt and the others react
quint leaps to his feet caught off guard
kipling reaches for his shoulder holster
a silhouette beside the open door to the outer office nudges cassandra into the light of the room then steps out himself
it is jetson
quint gets his gun out is about to aim
when his eyes go wide at the sight of something jetson holds
it is the plastic explosive charge that quint was wiring to the slug mobile
the wires are connected and jetsons finger squeezes down hard on the detonation push switch
hes got the c charge
jetson moves forward slowly holding the bomb in front of him
he is sweating rivers
the others quickly join him
he nudges cassandra ahead of himself keeping her where he can see her
continuing just take it real casual buddy
keep your finger on that button and dont do nothing squirrely
if you release that button you not only kill us but yourself
to get you and that indicates drug in suitcase i would do it
he says it with such straightforward eye contact that harcourt and we know he isnt bluffing
everyone up against that wall
to harcourt except you
harcourt remains behind the desk
cassandra stays where she is near jetson
the others move to the wall
kipling in particular is going nuts letting this happen
jetson takes the sample dispenser from the table tosses it into the suitcase then closes the lid and locks it
all the while keeping his eye on harcourt and the others
one small matter seems to have escaped your attention
that indicates suitcase is not on any books as a controlled substance
legally it might as well be fifty kilos of
the charge is murder
and conspiracy to commit murder
hubley porter strader
theres a flicker of concern behind harcourts icy blue eyes
cassandra stares at harcourt
you killed strader
cassandra runs to harcourt grabbing his jacket
did you do something to todd
harcourt looks down at her totally uninvolved
who is todd
then remembers smiles ah poor mr
cassandras eyes go wide as the horror of what he said sinks in
jetson nudges harcourt with the suitcase
they start out
cassandra wild with rage grabs quints
and with a keening wail brings it up toward harcourts face
jetson drops the suitcase as he lunges for the gun
he manages to knock it away just as she fires the bullet going into the wall behind harcourt
striking like a mongoose kipling leaps forward grabbing the two lead wires on the bomb in jetsons hand and jerking them apart
jetson reacts an instant late
releasing the switch
and nothing happens
i got it
kipling tackles jetson and they both go crashing to the floor
quint grabs the gun from cassandra and hammers her with it hard
she drops to her knees and quint viciously hits her again
meanwhile jetson struggles to regain his feet
kipling rears back and delivers a crushing blow under jetsons arm to the nerve plexus
jetson instantly folds over forward and kipling savagely brings up his knee into jetsons face flipping him back
kipling slams him into the wall face first pinning him there
kill them both
raging do it
quint brings the gun up places the muzzle against the base of cassandras skull starts to squeeze the trigger
theres a loud blam
and cassandra flinches
then looks up
quint is blown backward away from her
sykes stand in the doorway from the private office the casull smoking in his hand
quint hits the wall behind him only its not a solid wall but the huge window overlooking the club
he crashes through it
as the wall of mirror explodes in slow motion and quint cartwheels to the floor in a shower of diamonds
kipling shoves jetson aside draws his gun and fires at sykes
sykes dodges into the private office for cover
the three dealers dive behind any available furniture
harcourt snatches up the suitcase and rushes to the door leading into the adjoining outer office
sykes swings around the edge of the private office door straight arms the casull into the office and fires
kipling fires back crossing toward the outer office door covering harcourts back
sykes ducks back down
an unsteady jetson rises from the floor sees harcourt and kipling escaping and takes off after them
sykes straight arms the gun into the room again
sees jetson disappearing through the adjoining office door
he moves into the room as the three drug dealers arms up in surrender rise from behind the furniture
dont shoot man were unarmed look
sykes looks at these harmless wimps
then at cassandra
dazed but all right yeah
and he charges out the adjoining office door
harcourt and kipling bang down the metal stairs
jetson is ten feet above them
sykes flies out onto the fire escape a few steps behind jetson
a police car siren is heard arriving o
two uniformed officers bound from their unit and run into the back entrance of the club leaving the unit running
two seconds later harcourt and kipling leap down from the fire escape find themselves near the unit
he throws the suitcase into the passenger side door jumps in
kipling dives in behind the wheel slams it into gear and floors it
jetson and sykes hit the ground just as the unit peels out
sykes raises the casull and fires at the fleeing car
one slug shatters a tail light others pepper the rear of the trunk but the car keeps going
he indicates the slug mobile parked nearby
they race to it jump in
he burns rubber as he pulls out
a second arriving police unit pulls into the alley heading straight for the slug mobile
sykes has to grate between the alley wall and the arriving police unit to get past
harcourt and kipling in the first police unit come thundering down the street zig zagging through traffic
the slug mobile is three quarters of a block behind them
harcourt begins fumbling with the dash switches
eventually hitting the right ones and the roof lights and siren blast on
it looks like a backwards chase the slug mobile chasing the howling police car through traffic
jetson alertly eyes the approaching traffic calls it out to sykes the way he was trained at the academy
slow traffic on your right
youre clear at the left rear
sykes changes lanes careful red light ahead
with jetsons help sykes is able to dice through the cross traffic without incident
the traffic ahead of the police car peels off in response to the approaching lights and siren
kipling dodges around the stopped traffic easily
the same traffic that has pulled over for the police car now starts easing back onto the street cutting off the slug mobile
sykes expression tells us hes slipped into the same juggernaut mode we saw during the foot chase in the alley
yellow light ahead turning red
but sykes doesnt slow instead he floors it
continuing wide eyed red light
sykes peels around the merging traffic cuts across the intersection and continues the chase
on the wrong side of the road head on into traffic
headlights peel off in front of them as they charge along the wrong side
they eventually catch up to the police unit racing parallel to it but with the divider between them
sykes keeps one hand on the wheel and draws the casull with the other
he brings it up and around right in front of jetsons nose pointing it through the passenger window at kipling
at that moment kipling glances over and reacts to the bore of this huge gun staring him in the kisser
jetson reacts to the gun in his face
then reacts to something else he sees beyond it
green light matthew
sykes doesnt respond green light
now sykes looks
the light at the intersection has just turned green and the rows of the cars that were waiting start coming
its a wall of headlights coming right for the slug mobile
sykes locks up the brakes
kipling veers around a couple of cars and speeds away
because of the other traffic sykes has only one course of action
he skids a left onto a side street
sykes burns rubber down this quieter street squeals a right onto another street that parallels the street the police unit is on
at the first street available he cuts back in behind the police unit
sykes car tears along below the overpass with the police unit directly above them
an on ramp approaches for the slug mobile and sykes floors it
harcourt turns in his seat just in time to see the slug mobile airborne as it flies from the on ramp landing a few feet behind the black and whites
with the slug mobile now the police unit hangs a right cuts through a parking lot and bounces onto the police unit hangs a u turn into the second street
it clips one of the civilian cars causing a pile up of traffic behind the police unit
the slug mobile skids to a stop blocked by the clog of traffic in the tunnel
sykes is out of the drivers door in a flash stand on the door frame and yells move your goddamned cars
people climb out of their cars dazed and bewildered ignoring sykes
sykes slides behind the wheel bangs his bumper into the car in front of him and pushes the car far enough forward to get around
he speeds off
kipling rockets up a freeway on ramp
harcourt smiles with satisfaction theres no sign of the slug mobile behind them
kipling eases off blends into the flow of traffic
sykes slaloms the slug mobile through the civilian traffic like mario andretti lapping the pack at indianapolis
jetson spots the police unit in the right hand lane ahead
sykes sees it
thinking fast he eases off using another car as a blind
he waits until the police unit is parallel to an off ramp then guns ahead and swings right directly for the police unit
kipling looks over reacts just as the slug mobile broadsides the police unit
sykes forces the police unit up the off ramp
door handle to door handle the two cars slue to the right
the police unit breaks out in front but sykes stays right on its ass
they charge up onto the police unit and slug mobile bumper to bumper at as the cars scream along jetson cranes out the side window looking in distress at the
inky seawater flashing past below
they reach the far end of the bridge and skid wide onto a clear two lane straightaway near the ocean
sykes pushes the slug mobile to its limits pulls alongside the police unit
the two cars trade blows at mph
kipling manages to send sykes onto the dirt shoulder slowing him down
kipling watches the slug mobile in the rearview mirror then looks back out the front to see the end of the road coming up fast
harcourt bellows to kipling who slams on the brakes
the police unit skids to a stop before hitting a chain link fence where the road ends
an abandoned drawbridge and the ocean are on the other side of the fence
with nowhere else to go harcourt yells something at kipling and kipling floors it back the way they came
the two cars are racing for a full head on
at the last instant sykes wrenches the wheel throws the slug mobile sideways passenger side first
the police unit smashes into the rear door and fender of the slug mobile both cars skidding madly to a stop
a fire ignites under the hood of the police unit
sykes sits stunned behind the wheel
disoriented but conscious he raises his head looks over
sees jetson out cold his forehead gashed and bleeding
then he looks over and sees the fire growing under the police units hood which is crunched up against the rear of the slug mobile near the gas tank
sykes slides out of the drivers door stumbles to jetsons door wrenches it open and drags the huge unconscious alien away from the cars
hes still dragging jetson away when he spots harcourt pulling himself through the smashed police unit window
bruised and bleeding harcourt reaches in for the suitcase then starts to run with it
with jetson a safe distance away from the cars sykes clambers to his feet draws the casull and starts off after harcourt
harcourt reaches the chain link fence leading to the closed drawbridge
he heaves the suitcase over then starts to climb
sykes lumbers past the burning police unit
kipling is still behind the wheel his head slumped forward
sykes is just past the cars when they explode sending hoods and door panels and glass flying in all directions
harcourt on the other side of the fence grabs the suitcase and limps off into the shadowy world of the abandoned drawbridge
sykes reaches the fence
instead of climbing he simply blows the lock to hell with the casull and kicks open the gate
the end of the bridge is in the up position
a huge asphalt slab stabbing up into the night sky
harcourt runs along the pools of light and dark at the edge of the bridge the black seawater drifting past beside him
his foot slips once and he almost goes over the side
sykes backlit by the burning cars the big casull a prominent part of the silhouette just keeps coming
harcourt reaches the shadows at the end of the bridge and has nowhere to go
he is backed into a corner with seawater on two side of him
harcourt pivots frantically sees sykes coming this way
harcourt is a trapped animal
his chest heaves in panic
then his gaze falls on the suitcase behind him
a look of resolve comes into his eye
he eases cautiously toward the shadows where he knows harcourt is
theres some movement among the shadows and sykes straight arms the casull his finger white against the trigger
perspiration drips into sykes eye but he doesnt blink
a long moment then harcourt emerges from the darkness
his face is composed the superior glint is back in his eye
his arms are held away from his sides at degree angles clearly in surrender
sykes cat steps forward slowly
harcourt stares at sykes eyes and the desire there that harcourt will give him an excuse
move a finger harcourt and youre history
no sergeant not history
and now sykes sees it harcourt has been holding one of the one kilo glass cylinders of the drug concealed behind his arm
he brings it up over his head grins at sykes then tilts back his head and cracks the cylinder open
the blue gel pours into his mouth and down his chin
his mouth fills
he looks back at sykes making eye contact
his eyes mad defiant
and he swallows
long hold then the wallop of the overdose hits him
his face contorts in agony as he begins to convulse
sykes wide eyed lowers the casull and watches as harcourt drops to the ground and goes into a massive violent seizure
his limbs hammer against the deck
his back arches fiercely
it is a brutal agonizing ten seconds
then finally his body becomes still
sykes stunned at what hes just witnessed slowly goes to him and takes his pulse the way he saw jetson do it
he notices the suitcase nearby latches it and hefts it
he carries it with him back toward the inferno of the wrecked cars the casull hanging heavy and cold in his hand
he approaches the burning cars heading for jetson
as he passes the burning cars we have a half second to register that the drivers door of the police unit is now open before a dark figure hurtles at
sykes back from o
sykes is thrown forward
the suitcase crashes to the ground and the casull goes skittering off
sykes looks up to be met by the singed and bleeding nightmare visage of kipling
kipling reaches down for the suitcase then sykes hears it the telltale clinking sound
he looks and sees the exotic silver bracelet on kiplings wrist
it connects for him this is the bandana alien the one who killed bill tuggle
kipling brings the suitcase above his head
he is a half second from hurling it down on sykes skull when a gun roars
kipling is thrown back by the chest wound
jetson half sitting up holds the smoking casull
kipling recovers enough to come at sykes again with the suitcase again
jetson shaking but determined fires again and again and again
kipling is driven backward by the fusillade the suitcase still over his head
until he is blasted at last and forever suitcase and all into the molten core of the inferno
sykes rises makes his way to jetsons side
jetson has let the weight of the gun carry his hand to the ground
sykes kneels beside him gently taking the gun from the aliens hand
the two partners remain like this bathed in the orange flickering glow of the fire
of the drawbridge the debris the carnage and our two cops
the police mop up is winding down
cop cars coroners wagons fire trucks
we move through it all to find sykes and jetson seated on the curb away from the railing
with harcourt and kipling dead i assume you will be requesting reassignment now
cool itd be for your own good
i think youd be better off with a partner whos a little more
by the book
smiles still i gotta tell you george for a quiet guy youre sure hell on wheels once you get going
id kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective
he glances up as they are bathed in red and blue light
a patrol car has pulled up next to them
inside is wiltey a uniformed cop
ill give you guys a lift to the station
theyre waiting to take your statements on the shootings
to jetson lets go partner
then casually correcting wiltey as he rises and its shooting
they said two
i didnt shoot harcourt
we rapidly push in on him as his head snaps around toward sykes
his expression tells us his blood has just turned to ice
angle forward shooting from the rear of the wagon toward the driver and attendant up front
so its just me and her left in the hot tub right
you and the blonde
no man the redhead
the blondes gone in the house with some other guy
but a few minutes later she comes back out alone when me and the redhead are going at it fast and furious in the tub ya know
and she sees us and
she climbs right in with us
youre full of shit
i swear it
if im lyin im dyin
and without warning a large inhuman hand flies up in f
having ripped through the sealed body bag just below jetson is up front with wiltey sykes sits in the back though he is on the edge of the seat leaning
forward toward the front
jetson is intently nervously scanning ahead and to both sides
you are certain this is the route they would have taken
im not positive but probably
warily whats this about george
i know that look
spots something out a side window there
down that side street
wiltey brakes backs up then turns into the side street
as they approach an eerie scene
the coroners wagon is stopped at an angle in the middle of the intersection headlights and roof lights cutting into the night the back doors wide open
a patrol car is also here on the other side of the wagon
there is no movement anywhere near the two vehicles
wiltey pulls the car up his eyes like saucers at the eerie scene
he reaches for the radio hand mike
jetson quickly covers it with a large hand
both sykes and wiltey look at him we must do this alone
jetson is already sliding out of the car
jetson sykes and wiltey move warily forward their guns drawn
they reach the van and sykes takes wilteys flashlight shines it through the open back doors
the doors are bent outward smashed half off their hinges
one of the body bags is ripped open literally split from end to end
the blue and red lightbar on the other patrol car can be seen through the wagons front windshield
jetson starts around the wagon toward the patrol car sykes and wiltey follow
lights all ablaze it too is abandoned
one door has been wrenched off its hinges and lays in the street and the front windshield is smashed
our three cops approach the car then wiltey spots something beyond the unit
sykes and jetson look
the bodies of the coroner wagon driver and attendant as well as the two officers from the patrol car are crushed and beaten and stretched out on the asphalt
their arms are twisted as though by a mad force each pointing down the street toward the dock warehouses ahead
wiltey stumbles away backward
im calling for back up now
but wiltey is going
jetson starts after him
but sykes grabs his arm hard and spins him
what is this
low its harcourt
harcourt is dead
no hes not
not if he overdosed on the drug
searches for the words massive amounts trigger a
your body functions seize up you appear to be dead but its really a state of incubation
when you emerge youre
looks at the four bodies sprawled before him tell me about it
one minute later
open close on a light shining into camera then widen to reveal it is one of the door mounted spotlights on wilteys patrol car
wiltey eases the car down the center of the street
sykes and jetson guns ready walk slowly along on either side of the car
as they move past the shadowy dock warehouses
watching for any signs of movement
sykes and jetson converse across the hood of the car as they walk
their eyes everywhere
i never thought id say this but for once in my life i think im willing to wait for back up
we cant let him get away
why the hell are you so dead set against back up
a difficult admission because
because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming
but theres no more drug
you understand that
but how many others will
sykes looks across at jetsons troubled expression
just then wiltey spots a flit of movement cutting across his headlight beams fifty yards ahead
whatever it was was large and fast
it darted into an open warehouse door
there he is
and wiltey floors it
sykes and jetson watch unable to stop him
he and sykes take off running
wiltey skids to the left rockets in through the open warehouse door out of sight
sykes and jetson pour it on
they hear a screech of brakes
they reach the warehouse door and race through
low angle shooting across the underside of wilteys stopped patrol car as sykes and jetsons feet appear around the corner of the warehouse door
the car is still running the exhaust pipe still rumbling and expelling fumes
the feet slow
then cautiously start around the car
we pan with them as they move around the side of the car
a dark liquid begins dripping in extreme f
we move up to a close up of the car bumper
the dark liquid is blood dripping deep red on the shiny chrome
we move up farther and there is wilteys severed head
in close up resting on the hood of the patrol car
sykes and jetson stop dead at the sight
wilteys body lies in a heap on the floor near the car
they both stare then sykes looks around the shadowy interior of the warehouse his expression saying what the hell could have done this so fast
there are two paths to go
both dark and scary as hell
the sound of a distant fog horn blends with the creaks and drips of this waterfront building
jetson reaches into the patrol car and pulls the shotgun from the dash mount
he checks the chamber as sykes checks the casull
they exchange a knowing look
then wordlessly they split up
sykes takes the path to the left jetson to the right
as he moves into a dark area
he slowly picks his way along a long wall having to step over all sorts of piled debris heading toward us
we pan slightly to the left to hold a door in close up
the door already ajar eases open slightly wider
jetson hears this
he reaches the door sets himself then spins and kicks the door open all the way
theres nothing inside
jetson looks up sees movement in the distance
it is sykes quite far away in another section of the warehouse
sykes leaves jetsons field of view
sykes walks around a corner freezes and cocks his head as he hears voices followed curiously by laughter
he eases forward peers around a bend and sees a table and a chair
on the table is a mini television tuned to some local late night talk show
theres a thermos a steaming cup of coffee and a twinkie with a single bite out of it beside the tv
the chair is empty except for a jacket slung across the back the word security stitched on the breast
the guard is nowhere in sight
sykes moves toward the table taking in this eerie sight
he looks around then continues on
jetson moves among the dark nooks and crannies comes to a set of stairs leading to an upper floor
the top of the stairs is pitch black
jetson adjusts his grip on the shotgun slowly starts up the stairs
sykes comes to rack upon rack of drying fish nets hanging from the ceiling
he has no alternate route he begins pushing through them
because of the dimness he cant see much beyond each rack of nets immediately before him
he keeps wading through its like a house of mirrors he cant tell now much farther he has to go to get out of the nets and the deeper in
he gets the harder it would be to go back the way he came
he pushes past one particular rack of nets and looming out of the darkness ahead of him is a terrifying face
he stumbles back gets tangled in the nets brings up the casull is about to fire when
he sees what the face is
its the maidens figurehead from the bow of an old ship
the wood is worm eaten and decayed creating a hideous visage
sykes stands there a moment trying to jump start his heart again
jetson moves along the rickety planks
he comes to a door
he eases it open enters
jetson moves into the shadowy confines
he hears an incessant drip from a sink faucet in the corner
he moves to it
turns the spigot stopping the drip
other drips are heard from a dozen other hidden recesses all around him
he glances up at the filthy mirror attached to the wall above the sink
suddenly he sees the movement of something behind him
he spins with the shotgun
a huge shadow moves along the wall
he pivots the shotgun again toward the source of the shadow
its a length of black tarp torn and flapping from the ceiling
jetson lets out a deep breath
angle down a short passageway to an intersecting hallway
a strand of something hangs in frame in out of focus f
it makes an indistinct rhythmic clinking sound
sykes moves along the intersecting hallway
the clinking sound catches his attention
he stops listens then starts down the passageway toward us
he comes forward into the storage room having to get very close to the strand of something before he sees what it is
its a double strand of chain clinking gently against itself
sykes reaches out steadies the chain silencing it
it couldve been a natural occurrence
or something could have brushed against it setting it in motion
he tightens his grip on the casull backing away from the chain
he senses something behind him and spins
however behind him now in soft focus we glimpse movement at the other end of the short passageway
it is a figure moving slowly forward down the passageway back lit by the hallway light behind it its shadow filling the passageway as it approaches sykes
it stops inside the room now directly behind sykes
close enough to reach out and touch him
it is an alien silhouette but larger more powerful
suddenly sykes senses something is there
he turns slowly and as he steps from the shadows just like he did the last time sykes saw him on the abandoned drawbridge
only this time it is a horribly transformed harcourt
his eyes are red rimmed and piggish
his head is lumpen his skin thick and hard
his neck muscles are corded giving him a kind of hellish cobras cowl
there is still intelligence behind the eyes but it is a feral intelligence now
his voice a guttural rumble looking for me sergeant
sykes stumbles back several steps wildly brings up the casull and fires
the powerful casull round catches harcourt in the shoulder jerking him back
jetson in another area of the docks hears the echoing blast of the casull
he gauges as best he can the direction it came from and takes off running
harcourt recovers from the jolt of the bullet impact
the cloth of his disheveled shirt is shredded and powder burned but the bullet couldnt pierce his plated skin
harcourt smiles with grotesquely altered teeth starts toward sykes
scared shitless sykes rapid fires
one of his shots misses shattering a crate beside harcourts head
the remaining shots strike harcourt full on
harcourt is jerked by the impact of the bullets each time snarling in anger but none of the hits stop him
the casull is empty and harcourt keeps coming
sykes stumbles back but harcourt is on him in a flash
harcourt grabs sykes arm holding the gun yanks hard
we hear the pop as the shoulder dislocates
sykes hollers and the gun jumps out of his hand
jetson races in shotgun ready
the last of sykes shots are still echoing
jetson looks around frustrated unable to tell exactly where they are coming from
he sees the likely path and charges that way
on the cut sykes body is already tumbling down these rickety stairs attached to the side of the warehouse having been thrown ruthlessly from above
as sykes body sprawls on the dock the massive figure of harcourt appears at the top of the stairs
sykes scraped and bruised struggles to his feet
harcourt moves down the stairs then vaults over the railing the last fifteen feet
harcourt lurches forward and with a taloned grip on sykes shoulders propels him down the docks
the first two arriving black and whites skid to stops at the coroners wagon
the officers leap out flagging other arriving units to continue on toward the warehouses
sykes is on his feet but his knees buckle and he almost collapses again
harcourt comes at him
then sykes sees it a fishing boat chugging along past the end of one of the jetties
sykes makes a break for it
jetson charges out at the top of the rickety stairs frantically scanning for any sign of sykes
then in the distance he spots the two figures running along the jetty sykes being chased by the re formed harcourt
jetson gives the water surrounding the docks an apprehensive look then gathers up his courage and races down the stairs to help sykes
sykes lumbers along the narrow jetty
the fishing boat is already passing the end of the jetty
harcourt is fast behind sykes as he reaches the end of the jetty and vaults off toward the stern of the boat landing on the fishing net piled on the
he yells in pain as his ankle twists under his weight
sykes lies there holding his arm breathing hard relieved that he has escaped
harcourt cant reach the boat from the same jetty sykes did so he jumps on a platform beside this jetty then onto a second jetty
and from here he vaults across the seawater onto the boat
sykes sees the phantom figure land on the boat near the cabin
the fishing boat chugs up the channel toward the open sea
jetson sees this and is shitting bricks
suddenly the stark beam of a police helicopter sun gun stabs down from above
jetson looks up to see the chopper coming in low the sun gun washing over the docks
the sun gun hits jetson standing on the dock frantically waving his badge at the copter signaling it down
the pilot starts to take it down
sykes is on all fours clawing his way up the fishing net toward the back of the boat
harcourt gets one hand on his leg
sykes jerks his leg away and harcourts claws dig deep through sykes pants into his legs as he pulls away
sykes bellows in pain
jetson is barely in the seat as it lifts away from the dock
he has to catch himself from falling out the open door
below uniformed cops are now seen rushing out onto the dock
on that boat out there
jetson indicates the fishing boat headed toward the mouth of the channel
the helicopter tilts forward and goes
sykes manages to pull himself up into the dinghy hanging over the stern of the fishing boat
he pushes to the back of the dinghy as harcourts savage visage appears at the bow
harcourt grins the predator with his prey trapped
jetsons face is bathed in sweat as he looks out at the channel water racing past beneath
they come up on the boat and the pilot plays the sun gun onto the deck looking for movement finally pinning sykes and harcourt at the stern dinghy
the captain reacts to the helicopter overhead looks back at what the sun gun spotlights
he sees harcourt standing at the bow of the dinghy starting to clamber in
harcourt turns sees the captain on the bridge above him
he reaches for a wood handled gaff nearby
he rears back with it and lets it fly like a spear
the gaff impales the captain off center in his chest
the captain his face frozen in shock is thrown back against the throttle
the boat lunges forward as the engines rev loudly
harcourt is thrown into the dinghy with sykes
as harcourt recovers sykes spots the release for the tie line on the dinghy
he lunges forward throwing the ratchet
the line plays out and the dinghy slides backward into water
jetson watches this happen
the dinghy bangs along at the end of the ten foot tie line in the wake of the speeding fishing boat
harcourt claws his way toward sykes
water is already splashing in over the stern transom
the dinghy is sinking
harcourt grabs sykes leg and pulls him toward him
sykes holds on to the stern cleats with all his might
harcourt yanks him free
sykes kicks wildly at the ratchet release trying to free the remainder of the line
harcourt is coming in for the kill when sykes foot connects with the ratchet lever
the rest of the tie line snakes through the ratchet freeing the dinghy from the fishing boat
the dinghy is rocking wildly sinking fast
a wave from the fishing boats wake splashes in over the side
some of it hits harcourt he howls and falls away
sykes sees this tries to clamber over the side but harcourt is on him again
sykes body weight at the side of the dinghy coupled with the rocking motion cause more water to wash in over the transom
jetson reacts to sykes and harcourt battling in the dinghy below
harcourt who is getting more and more wet howls in agony thick blood beginning to bead wherever the water touches
sykes is taking one hell of a beating
harcourt sweeps sykes up in a bear hug is about to crush his rib cage when sykes shifts his body weight knocking harcourt off balance
harcourt wobbles fear on his face for the first time then he finally loses it and the two of them tumble overboard into the water capsizing the dinghy
sykes breaks the surface gasping for air frantically clawing with his one good arm at the wedge of dinghy still above the water
suddenly behind him harcourts partially melted form erupts from the water lunges on top of sykes and drags him under
jetson hangs in the open door watching in horror wanting to help knowing he cant
sykes breaks the surface harcourts misshapen lump of a body unmoving but still on top of him
sykes shoves it away struggling to stay afloat
his head keeps dunking under
jetson screws up his courage and turns to the pilot
take it down
take it down
the helicopter moves down toward the turbulent water
jetson hangs in the doorway watching sykes head dunking under again
the helicopters skids are three feet above the water
to pilot sykes outreached hand stretches up from the water but the skid is just too high
jetson has no alternative and he does the bravest thing he has ever done
he moves out onto the narrow helicopter skid
hanging on three feet above the water he reaches down for sykes up reaching hand
the fingertips of the two hands waver mere inches from each other
jetson stretches farther farther
and the two hands meet
jetson winces from the pain of the seawater on sykes hand
he starts pulling sykes up
his eye sockets are empty and his skin is mostly gone
the nearly skeletal body heaves blindly onto sykes breaking his grip from jetsons and dragging him under again
jetson is frantic
he keeps waiting but this time sykes doesnt come up
jetson doesnt know what to do
finally he leans down as far as he can his face a foot from the water screams to block the pain and plunges his own arm below the surface
he feels around gets hold of something and pulls
it is sykes wrist
he pulls hard bringing the sputtering sykes up out of the water
to pilot take it up
the pilot does
sykes comes up out of the water
his feet are just clear of the surface when harcourts hand and arm rocket out of the water grabbing sykes ankle
sykes looks down in horror
the helicopter keeps moving up and before harcourts body breaks the surface the arm tears away from the torso at the shoulder
sykes wildly shakes the clinging severed arm from his ankle and it falls back into the water below
jetson continues pulling him up into the helicopter as it moves off toward shore
sykes plops on the floor soaked battered holding his limp arm
jetson is quickly whipping off his jacket wrapping the dry part around his own arm wincing in pain
the pilot stare down at the circle of water where they just pulled sykes from
what the hell was that down there
it was weird
jetson looks at sykes wondering if he will say
sykes looks at jetson a long moment then looked like every other damn slag to me
just plain ugly
despite the pain jetson smiles
we are close on sykes who is having a hell of a time trying to tie a tuxedo tie with one arm in a sling
a pair of alien arms reach into frame to help him
one of the alien arms is also in a sling
angle widens to reveal the alien is jetson
both men wear tuxedos
how do i look
you look very good
theres a knock at the door
sykes opens it
there stands sykes daughter kristin twenty years old looking radiant in her wedding dress
she is in a foyer and behind her is the interior of the church with all the assembled guests including mrs
sykes heart melts
before moving to the door george uh
i want to apologize now in advance for all the rotten things ill ever say or do to you over the years
sykes moves to join his daughter
as he does that is all right matthew
after all you are only human
sykes caught off guard has to laugh
under his breath what a wildman
sykes takes his daughters arm and the two of them start down the aisle
