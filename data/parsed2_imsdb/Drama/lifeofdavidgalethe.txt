by charles randolph march a dishevelled woman in a business suit runs down a lonely highway in texas hill country moving desperately through the thick morning fog
shes carrying a vhs cassette
the sounds of her breathing and shoes hitting the pavement echo into the mist
she runs and runs
she slows out of strength looks up and down the highway
both in front and behind it leads straight into the mist a tunnel of fog
she stumbles on a final effort
a clock on the wall
beneath the clock a simple banner reads deathwatch austin
its probably been about seven minutes
the office is small cheaply furnished
one wall is filled with neat rows of x s of death row inmates
about percent have red crosses over their faces
five people wait in tense silence
a skinny college guy with a mullet and pinch of skoal in his mouth looks at a computer screen
a co ed cuddles a styrofoam cup of coffee sobs quietly
a matronly woman sits quietly at a desk holding a phone to one ear
the clocks minute hand changes from to
constance harraway bookish sits beside david gale
he wears a blue yale sweatshirt
they both stare at nothing
she bites her lip
weve got pronouncement
roughly eight minutes
a beat as he records the time number this year for the great state of texas
they all exchange looks theyve lost
david dont start throwing things
a phone rings
david controls himself
im going home
lets do the press fax tomorrow
another phone rings
ill do it
he nods to her exits
she walks to the photo wall
with a red magic marker she marks a cross over the photo of a hispanic male
the wall clock reads
the office is in a largely abandoned mini mall
its going to be a clear summer day
david hurries through the empty parking lot to volvo station wagon
as the car exits the lot we see the austin skyline with the capitol building in the distance
david drinks from a travel cup as he drives windows down
david stops at a red light beside a squad car with one cop inside
the cop gives him a cursory glance
he stares at the cop
the cop looks neutrally ahead behind him the buckle of his seat belt shoulder strap catches the reflection of the rising sun
he stares then hey
the cop ignores him
the cop looks over his face says he expects a confrontation
david points to the seat belt buckle
the cop nods weary embarrassed
he reaches back for the belt
david takes a sip and drives on
court tv reporter roberts stands in front of the supreme court
the high court also refused to stay fridays execution of former philosophy professor david gale
with her mouth full christ doin karaoke
kruger watches with a leg up on her messy desk eating low fat tortilla chips and massaging a knee with an electric massager
a name plate on her desk reads barbara d
kruger crime and courts editor
news magazine covers are on the walls
kruger is black short overweight wears an old jogging suit and new oversized athletic shoes
she has half frame granny glasses on a cord around her neck
gale had sought a review of his conviction for the rape and murder of university of texas colleague constance harraway
kruger reaches for a phone hits four numbers takes a chip
a book jacket photo of constance
defense lawyers had hoped to argue that gales former activism against capital punishment unduly prejudiced
she waits impatiently munching swallowing
the texas judicial system
citing discriminating purpose into the phone hey theyre not gonna stay gale
its on court tv right now listen
she holds the phone out in the direction of the tv uses the opportunity to eat another chip
we see old footage of david on a tv talk show
clear political gain in executing its leading opponent of the death penalty
into the phone swallowing so whats it gonna be
belyeu said to call after the decision
no they said only bitsey
further failed to consider that the victim was herself an abolitionist activist
it means only bitsey
bill i dont get to make the rules im a fat black woman
bitsey bloom the runner from the opening enters
she wears as always a tailored suit
into the phone what we need is to put her on a plane to houston
gales going down
kruger shushes her with a we know already gesture
into the phone why do you always get lordosis around legal
she puts him on speaker and reaches for a chip
to the phone hi
female apes posture when preparing for intercourse
bitsey shoots kruger a look mouths youre sick
look kids setting aside the cost issue though half a million dollars for three two hour interviews is not only illegal its obscen market value
guys never talked
that aside i we are still uncomfortable with the arrangement
meaning youve just spent a very public seven days in jail for a very public contempt of court citation
protecting sources even kiddie porn scumbags is magazine policy
and i we continue to appreciate your decision
were just concerned
a rapist slash murderer five days before hes executed demands a reporter known for protecting sexual deviants
a reporter who is also a very attractive woman bitsey and kruger moan in unison
this is disparate treatment
i could go if i were an ugly blabby guy
theres an agenda issue here which would be diffused with an older male
i hear lawyers gleefully saying the words bloom vs
news magazine inc
well your honor i started to notice that my assignments were evaluated on the basis of my sex
youve gotta let her go now
thats not quite what i meant
hes gotta let you go
certain references were made interrupting all right
the intern is with you at all times
bitsey vehemently shakes her head no to this idea
i we are hanging up
kruger hangs up the phone before he can respond
im not baby sitting
kruger reaches for a chip
zack boyish sits in the passenger seat smoking and looking at a case file in his lap
he holds the cigarette just outside the slightly open window
zack has a bohemian grunge thing going long hair ultra hip glasses
as bitsey drives she keeps looking down at the dashs instrument panel
we hear strained patience in her voice
gale was seen leaving the house
the cars lights move past a sign huntsville miles
his sperm was inside her
his prints were all over the kitchen including one on the bag
zack has a police photo a woman naked on a kitchen floor hands handcuffed behind her
over her head is an opaque white plastic bag sealed around the neck with duct tape
half a thumb print
okay half a thumb print
could have touched it before it was a murder weapon
do you fondle your friends garbage bags
yeah i get very touchy around household plastics
hello everybody ooooh tupperware
im just saying the bag could have been out on the counter or something
she looks at him a beat
he did it
but the murders way too fucking clumsy
and this guys a major intellectual
top of his yale class a rhodes gig tenured at two books
hes an academic stud
and empirically speaking a psychotic
zack picks up another file photo christmas shot of the gale family david his wife sharon beautiful and son chase
look at his wife shes a regular grace kelly
old money svelte
father was ambassador to spain looking at the cars instrument panel shit
the lights on again
its a rental
do you smell anything
besides the guys a flaming liberal
bitsey keeps looking down at the light
a persons politics has nothing to do with their propensity to commit crime
beat arent we supposed to smell it if its overheating
wrong seventy three percent of all serial killers vote republican
throw the cigarette out so we can smell
zack reaches for the car ashtray
youll stink up the car
throw it out
im not gonna fucking pollute
zack pinches the cherry off lets it drop out the window
he shows her the filter animatedly puts in the ash tray
she gives him a look
they ride a beat in silence
we better pull off
shit this is so irritating
how far to huntsville
she points to an approaching rest area exit sign
they share a glance then a laugh
zack affects an evil maniacal cackle
hard copy announcers voice news magazine reporters bitsy bloom and zack stemmons entered the rest area with car trouble
the car exits for the rest area
little did they know their troubles were just beginning
zack mimics the opening music to dark shadows
well lit and empty
the rental car is parked with the hood up
they stand looking at the radiator
is it hot
he puts his hand on it
isnt it always
so what do i do
i dont know something male
zack animatedly adjusts his balls spits
bitseys not paying attention
shes watching headlights coming toward them
i hope whoever it is never saw deliverance
a late model pickup pulls up behind them
they shade their eyes from its headlights
the lights go off
an older cowboy mid s stetson lizard skin boots steps out
you folks need some help
the motel lies adjacent to interstate and a kettle restaurant
the rental car pulls up to the reception building
the rental car is parked in front
the morning is overcast its sprinkling
bitsey emerges from one of the rooms on the second floor carrying an umbrella
bitsey enters and sees zack in a booth smoking and reading
the hyper smiley teenage hostess approaches her
how are you this morning
bitsey ignores her takes a menu without comment
she goes and sits across from zack hes reading dialogical exhaustion by david gale
little early isnt it
the non smoking sections over there
i meant the book
bitsey opens the menu he puts the book down
what time is it
the waitress says the ellis unit is about fifteen minutes out of town so weve got like five and half hours
i never eat where the menus have pictures of the food
i was thinking we should drive to austin check out the crime scene
could be some story stuff for us
without looking up first this isnt a story
its an interview
we come i listen you watch we go home
second there is no us in the assignment
okay what do i watch you do for the next five hours
closing the menu drive around looking for decent restaurant
you know your reputation as siberian female dog person doesnt do you justice
shes unsure how to interpret his comment
my reputation got us invited here
i play by the rules
its called objectivity
they stare at each other
zack picks up his book starts to read affects a shiver
the prison and adjacent parking lot can be seen a few hundred yards down the road
in front of the guardhouse is a sign tdc ellis unit
all visitors must report
the rental car enters the frame brakes briefly for the empty guardhouse and moves on toward the prison
bitsey and zack get out of their car
she has an umbrella
so where do we report
three razor wire fences surround the prison
guard towers rise at the corners
outside the fence sits a small building with a sign report here
bitsey makes a there you have it face
they move toward the building
they look over
within the fence a skinny hispanic inmate s spits
hes hunched in the rain thirty yards away
he watches them neutrally
camera tracks bitsey and zack as they walk nervously past a series of kennel like pens that run along a long building
inmates watch them pass a smoking tattooed white male s stands by his door
a muscular black man s with a muslim skullcap speaks quietly to the forty something redneck beside him
a paunchy hispanic s with a shaved head sits back against the building making clicking sounds
a skinny white guy with his shirt off tosses a tennis ball against the building
at the closest end of the last pen a gang banger s watches as he stands with his fingers clutching the chain link above his head
rain runs down his face
as bitsey and zack enter a clean cut man in his forties is on the phone duke grover
he waves them in and holds up a wait just a second finger
well i dont rightly know one fraternity from another
but if we catch any those boys out here again were gonna arrest and prosecute
you do that susan
the office has cheap wood paneling and a tired shag carpet
a portrait of governor hardin female mid s is on the wall a large aerial photograph of the prison on the other
at a desk sits a woman with texas hair s
grover hangs up
to the woman thank you margie
turning to bitsey and zack correspondents bloom and stevens i presume
they shake hands
sorry wont happen again
im duke grover t
grovers demeanor suggests a successful little league coach his suit suggests j
he speaks quickly
hes usually real good with names
to bitsey and these days i always like to ask now do you prefer miss mrs
bitsey it is
margie im stealin your umbrella
bitsey and grover walk beneath their umbrellas toward the unit gate grover walks as fast as he talks
zack follows turns his collar up
bitsey you ever been in a prison
zack smiles to himself
on death row
well we house inmates here
average stay with us is nine years
some get commuted move on most get killed

the unit fence gate parts as they enter
the older gate guard nods as they pass
to the guard afternoon earl
back to her weve got three concerns here safety safety and safety
the visitation area is entirely secure we just ask you dont touch the glass
windex gets expensive
they come to the door of the entrance area
rules say seven days prior to execution inmates must be interviewed in a cage
the door buzzes grover opens it
the lobby has institutional chairs and few vending machines
to one side is a guards counter and a walk through metal detector
they enter and make their way toward the counter
this changes for no man
youre not carryin a weapon are you
stemmons you packin
they arrive at the counter
behind it are two guards one male one female
to the guards clarence
new york guests for mr
may i see your purse maam
to bitsey indicating the metal detector go on and walk through
grover keeps talking as he walks around the detector and waits for her
now should any kinda of unpleasantness occur in the visitation area we ask that you stay put
come on through mr
and please follow the instructions of these fine correctional officers should they see fit to give you any
handing her the purse here you go maam
he leads them down the hall
anythin you say can be overheard
and any discussion of criminal activity on your part is admissible
not plannin a jailbreak are you bitsey
the door guard gets up from his small table and opens the door for them
here we are
the visitation hall has the linoleum and fluorescent feel of an empty school cafeteria
it is seamlessly intersected by curved wall of sheer glass
across the hall a guards booth is built into the concrete wall the two guards inside look like they are in a sound booth
every fifteen feet the glass has small sound holes
on the visitors side chairs with lap desks cluster at each section
just getting up from a chair in the halls center is a big man wearing an expensive suit and black cowboy boots
this is davids lawyer benjamin belyeu late s
on the prisoners side of the glass a row of ten chairs trace the outline of its curve
above each chair a microphone hangs from the ceiling
the center chair is in a stainless steel cage
inside sits david gale
calling out to belyeu all yours mr
to bitsey and zack you folks have safe visit now
he exits as bitsey and zack make their way toward belyeu and david its a walk of about twenty five feet
belyeus voice is a thick combination of cajun and harvard yard
belyeu speaks as slowly as grover did quickly
david stands up politely in his cage hes too tall and has to hunch
did that p
man validate your parkin
he said the gift shop could do it
belyeu laughs smiles pure old new orleans charm
to david shes a smart one
belyeu takes a few steps toward them extends his hand
benjamin belyeu mr
this is zack
turning and this is the man of the hour
they move toward david
a speaker system loudly really loudly interrupts sit down gale
david sits smiles a bit embarrassed
now why cant they turn that thing down
to the microphone above him my lawyer respectfully suggests you adjust the speaker system volume
they all look over at the guards booth
one of the guards makes a get on with your business gesture
theyre practicing being cruel and unusual
bloom im sure youre a bitin at the bit
belyeu collects papers from the chair he was using and starts to stuff them into his antique carpetbag
now it is our understanding that you are to have three two hour sessions
today tomorrow and thursday all at three in the p
im sorry we cant afford you more time but contrary to popular rumor we have not yet begun to fight
furthermore its our understanding that you will do this with no recording equipment of any kind

belyeu just smiles at her then looks up at the microphone
she understands nods

belyeu picks up his bag
he and zack start the hike to the door
belyeu turns walks backwards
good luck miss bloom
to david ill come by later
we can play a game of hangman take up smokin
david waves get lost
bye ya all
they watch him walk away
bitsey turns to david
hes looking at the floor caught in a thought
have a seat
she does so
david smiles at her he has a beautiful smile sincere charming vaguely devilish
hes a character
yeah known benny most my life
met the summer after th grade spent the day burning ants with his dads magnifying glass
we called it playing execution
david looks at her a beat lets the irony of this sit in the air
uncomfortable bitsey starts to look in her purse
since i grew up in foster homes hes become the only family i have
wheres your ex wife
bitsey takes a pad out of her purse looks for a pen
we agreed minimal contact would be easier
please dont mention her or my son
anything else just clearly say off the record
ill take it to my grave
but then you know that about me
otherwise i wouldnt be here
david smiles nods
referring to the pen is this recording equipment
how should we start
id say youre a man with a story to tell mr
you chose the magazine the format
you chose me
she sits with pen on paper poised for dictation
david looks at her a long beat then gives her the smile
camera starts to rotate and rolls throughout until the last belyeu gets in his cadillac in the wet ellis unit parking lot
from the air
sexy female grad student over dressed in a mini skirt and heels moves hurriedly through the university of texas u
attending class in an u
lecture hall they are laughing as david entertains from a mike at the podium
thirty animated students circa are listening to david lecture
hes younger vibrant looks like a grad student himself
on the white board behind him are phrases lucan objet petit a fantasy theory
what do you fantasize about
as no one responds thought so
light laughter money fame ferrari
as some guys applaud loudly others then boo them a pulitzer
applause a genius hunk ostensibly bad but secretly simmering with noble passions and willing to sleep on the wet spot
as women applaud
yells ill take two
a victorias secret model just slumming between law school and running her familys vastly endowed foundation for tragically sad eyed children
the crowd laughs david changes tone
okay good you see lucans point
fantasies must be unrealistic
the minute you get something you dont you cant want it anymore
to exist desire needs absent objects
so desire supports itself with crazy fantasies
the over dressed sexy grad student enters loudly from a side door out of breath and discombobulated
the crowd laughs at the timing
he animatedly gestures to the seats waits a beat as she moves towards them
this is what pascal means when he says the only time were truly happy is when day dreaming about future happiness
the sexy student sits adjusts herself
or why we say the hunt is sweeter than the kill or be careful what you wish for
a guy behind the sexy student taps her on the shoulder she turns and he hands her letter from the registrars office
its from a girl friend two rows back
the girlfriend mouths it came today
not because youll get it but because youre doomed not to want it if you do
think about it next time youre at a wedding
the sexy student turns back around throws the letter in a book
students pour out of the double doors leading from davids class
the hall is crowded
standing waiting for him against the wall is constance glasses granola clothes
shes looking at a document holds a file
the students are leaving
david is quickly erasing the white board
the sexy student approaches him her name is berlin
sorry about being late
there was you know a thing
there usually is berlin
look i know im not doing well
he turns nods takes his books and papers from the podium
and to torture a cliche id do anything to pass
he looks at her a beat starts to walk toward the door
anything professor gale
he stops turns
the smile anything
she affects a solicitous shyness then goes all sex
he checks the room then comes over to her close
tell you what ill give you good grade a really good grade if you will
leans down to her ear whispers sensually study
he smiles turns walks away
as she watches anger builds
david comes out the room
constance sees him hurries to him
shes excited and speaks now as always with absolute authority
they talk as they walk down the crowded hall
finished transcribing the governors radio and tv comments
listen i hate killing thats why im willing to kill to stop it
the woman breathes in soundbites
she hands him a copy
pretends to read a quote yes virginia the people of this state have overwhelmingly affirmed the reality of santa
you might can use some of her pre centrist stuff
tell me again why you arent doing the debate
you have a cuter butt
i hadnt noticed
thats not what i meant
david and constance exit the building into the sun
shes gonna do the whole mother thing
she empathizes with you completely but experience has given her the courage to take the tougher road ta da ta da
keep it rational
and flirt politely
governor you bat a lovely lash for a woman who executed thirty eight last year
theyve come to a sidewalk junction stop
and watch your ego
dont come across as one of those i hate authority because nobody in charge reads the new yorker types
yeah dont fall into one of your brooding silences
oh im getting new federal stats from amnesty tonight
im going to greers party
fax them to sharons number at the house
she looks at him sternly over the top of her glasses
if you have a hang over tomorrow hangs up walking away apropos playing mother
calling after him ten oclock
beat bright eyed and bushy tailed
the house is an immaculately restored two story victorian far better than what a university professor can afford
the grounds are perfect
davids volvo is in the driveway his wifes new laredo beside it
on the street out front sits a new vw beetle
davids son chase sits in bed holding a stuffed sheep in the air
david turns off the light in the adjacent bathroom comes in holding his sons jeans and shoes
david wears a t shirt which says evil doer curious person
the room is over decorated with boy stuff
did you mark your calendar
looking up at it yep
hangs above the bed opened to the month of march
it has a felt tipped pen hanging from a piece of string taped to it
ten frowny faces cover ten consecutive days then there are three empty days before a large smiley face awaits on the fourth
the frowny faces are in a kids hand the smiley face in an adults
counting on his fingers only
three more spain days
david puts the jeans and shoes away
thats great huh
david comes and sits beside his son
points to an african statue a man holding a spear on the bedside table
whats he doing in here
mommy said i could
just till she gets back
touching the spear thats a special duper monster laser knife
wheres your laser gun
chase reaches under the sheets searches finally pulls out a laser pointer
he shoots some toys in the corner with the red laser dot
tussshh tusssshh tussshh
i never shoot them in the eyes daddy
thats cause youre a special duper super quadruper boy
whos now going to sleep
he tucks his son in
who loves you
chase giggles points at his dad then pokes his nose
kissing him good night son
holding up his stuffed sheep do cloud dog
kissing the sheep good night cloud dog
obsessively cool full of designer furniture and rough fabrics
the art is mostly contemporary and conspicuously lit a damien hirst piece sits in one corner
a few african antiquities are scattered throughout
a babysitter sits on the couch reading a school textbook holding lip gloss and absentmindedly applying it as she reads
david passes on his way to the door
back before midnight
its cool mr
calling after him dont do anything i wouldnt
when she hears the door close the babysitter reaches for the tv remote
the duplex is upscale two story with a vaulted ceiling
scattered about are forty party goers mostly grad students
some spill out onto the back patio and around the pool
everyone has a t shirt with a philosophic idea yawnic mad bad and dangerous to know philosophic t shirt
greer late s persian host t shirt escorts david into the living room
the guys the immanuel kant of the n
consistent accurate effective and boring boring boring
greer leaves him at the sofa where an older professor s homemade t shirt pre socratic over his shirt and tie stands speaking with ross late s homosexualist t shirt
has an oxford accent hello david
wheres your better half
a beat well i was just off for air
he moves to the patio
they watch him go
under his breath looks like sharons affair is an open secret
under his breath hermeneutical bias the only fun truths are the ones someones trying to hide
normal tone have a seat
they sit on the sofa
listen berlins here and livid
probations suspended her
she received the letter today took the opportunity to throw a fit in my office
you should talking about me
shes standing behind them
david tilts his head back
shes tipsy brings her face down between their heads
to david he tell you i said when you were circumcised they threw away the wrong part
he mentioned it
an uncomfortable beat
she reaches over and takes rosss drink from his hand drinks the rest puts it back
its called schmuck
the part of the foreskin that gets thrown away
i think its called schmuck
arent we so fucking clever
standing escaping i suppose i should get us another
ross walks to the bar
berlin comes around and sits in his seat
her mid drift t shirt reads sex is power
you were a jerk this afternoon
shes turned facing him he looks forward
for what its worth i didnt know about the suspension
is that supposed to be an apology
more like a conciliation
ross has two gin and tonics and is finishing pouring davids black bush
he moves away
the table is neatly laid with snacks and bottles
the flower arrangement is perfect
the table is now in mid party chaos
food spilled bottles empty the flowers in disarray
im too sexy plays loudly in the background
berlin takes a bottle of red label from the table
camera tracks her through the living room where a few people now dance and out onto the patio
a crowd well on their way to being drunk gathers by the pool
they surround two patio chairs which face each other one with david the other with ross
the men are playing an irish drinking game the crowd has chosen favorites
slurring a bit all right
clears his throat as the poets have mournfully sung death takes the innocent young the screamingly funny the rolling in money and those who are very well hung
laughter a few animated moans
david raises his glass to ross and downs a whiskey
someone starts to chant gale
feeling good but very much in control there once was a lesbian from canjuom who took a young man to her room and they argued all night as to who
had the right to do what how and to whom
two women holding each other boo
cmon one more
the crowd wants more
someone makes chicken sounds
do you bow to the queen
david looks at him contemplates then smiles
he holds his glass out for a refill
the crowd applauds
the crowd is chanting ross
the crowd has dispersed
a couple of small groups converse
someone is being thrown into the pool
techno music plays
inside the duplex a few dancers are still going at it
david is washing his face
as he dries the techno music downstairs gets briefly louder
he looks from beneath the towel into the mirror
berlin has entered the bathroom
she locks the door leans back against it
he folds the towel
im not a student anymore
dont think i want to know what that means
david lays the towel down leans back against the sink they face each other on opposite sides of the bathroom
there once was woman named berlin who liked a bit now and again
not now and again but now
i have a secret
but i have to come over there to tell you
he makes an im not so sure face
she moves playfully toward him
here i come
she comes up to him leans into him as she puts her mouthclose to his ear
he keeps his hands back on the sink counter
whispering i wasnt after the grade
she stands with her body against him looks into his eyes
berlin this this is not
she puts her fingers over his mouth keeps them there
with her free hand she takes one of his rubs it against her face and lips as she speaks
well just talk analyze contemplate
you can put your mouth on my body
she moves his hand down brushing it against her breast and to her groin
she brings her mouth toward her fingers which are still against his lips
softly vulnerably dont reject me
with her eyes open she kisses the back of her own fingers runs her tongue between them opens them to reach his mouth
a hispanic woman t shirt derrida da bee bops to the bathroom door
tries the handle then dances away
about eight dancers dance to the techno music its pace increasing
a couple them are really into it
berlin and david are against the sink kissing in full passion
the music from downstairs seems louder
her t shirt is off
panting he turns her against the sink
pulls her skirt up reaches for her panties
rip them off
he does so
ross sits at the kitchen table holding his throbbing head against the pounding music
greer sets a cup of coffee in front of him sits across
a long beat
they seem like parents waiting out a teenagers party
berlin is back against the sink undoing davids fly as he takes his t shirt off
the music from downstairs seems even louder
his pants and underwear fall
he starts to penetrate her
she turns faces the mirror
he positions himself behind enters her
he moves against her
do it hard
he looks at her in the mirror then continues
she watches him
a guy sits alone at the far end of the pool on a lounger
the dancers can be seen in the living room behind him
david thrusts against berlin her thighs pound against the edge of the sink
the music is as loud as it is downstairs
he looks at her in the mirror unsure
he thrusts harder
they continue in rhythm
she reaches back and pulls him into her
bite my shoulder
she watches him do so in the mirror
the dancers dance the techno pace has increased even more
one dancer is a blur
berlin is pulling david into her
they approach a climax
she scratches him on the small of the back
the music and dancers are in pure frenzy
suddenly the music stops
greer stands by the stereo his hand coming back from the power button
he gestures thats all folks
david and berlin stand still and apart breathing heavily into the reality inducing silence
he looks at her in the mirror a look of shame
she gives him an odd smile
constance wakes with a jolt sweating
she gets up and goes into her bathroom
she turns on the light moves to the sink opens the medicine cabinet
its stacked with prescription medicines
suddenly she turns to the toilette vomits
david and constance sit by a window the u
campus in the b
davids distracted wearing a suit and a long face
shes wearing the closest thing she has to business attire
she has stacks of paper spread in front of her
okay lets say we find an innocent on death row
corrections would let him go
governor harding would go on tv say thanks to the good people at deathwatch the system works
yeah if they executed an innocent and we had absolute undeniable in your face proof we could demand abolition
just like happened in england
are you okay
coming out of it sorry
he makes an effort plays the good listener
but it hasnt happened not since
and wont happen
dead men cant make a case
and almost martyrs dont count
just keep it rational
the death penalty is expensive and ineffective
no one wants to see a murderer as a victim
and stop that
i hate active listeners
makes me feel like im with a dale carnegie grad who cares more about appearing to listen than actually listening
did you bring the amnesty fax
i can listen and appear to listen at the same time
damn i left it home
i have a copy
she looks through her papers finds the copy in the stack beneath her coffee cup
she starts to hand it to him
he is looking out the window caught in a thought
you want to tell me whats up
something profoundly stupid happened last night
teasing i hope you used a condom
his reaction tells her the jest hit home
jesus christ david
was she one of yours
a longer beat
he holds her eyes
it was berlin
shes stunned then genuinely angry
oh thats great great
i can hear the grapevine now
they suspended her so gale could dick her with a clear conscience
he looks at his coffee which he hasnt touched
a power differential equals coercion
you are so weak
constance youre not my wife
i know you can tell yourself its a position i aspire to but believe me i would rather
she trails off
they stare at each other a beat
then she starts to collect the papers
i didnt mean lets go
as she collects she winces grabs her side
are you okay
yes lets just go
two people sit in front of monitors displaying various angles on sound stage
the main monitor is playing the end of the shows signation
in three two
a camera operator cues the host s male bow tie
the host is flanked by david and governor hardin
the set has an upscale regional television look
the governor has the rare ability to look comfortable while david fidgets
to camera welcome back to batters box
tonight we continue our very special four part series with the governor hardin
arguing capital punishment with her is deathwatch coordinator professor david gale
governor youre up
alan let me say somethin i always say
constance stands behind the cameras
she motions to david something about the papers in front of him
and im gonna keep on sayin
and that is i hate killin
thats why my administration is willing to kill to stop it
so you dont subscribe to the idea that a good state is one that protects its most despised members
its a nice liberal idea but like most nice liberal ideas naive
its a quote from you governor from your first state attorney campaign
constance is biting her lip breaks into a smile
the governor is unsure how to react then laughs
the host chuckles with her
youve got me professor
but let me in my defense give you a quote
winston churchill if youre not a liberal at twenty youve got no heart if youre still a liberal at thirty youve got no brain
the hosts laughter is overdone
constance bites her lip
so basically you feel to choose another quote society must be cleansed of elements which represent its own death
the governor makes an animated thinking face
i would have to agree
chuckles again did i say that too
that was hitler
constance makes a yes
gesture with her hands
the governor is surprised into silence
the host laughs and noting her reaction trails off
david becomes more confident his tone more sincere
governor cant we examine the possibility that capital punishment isnt working
that murderers arent deterred by the law because they have about as much forethought as lemmings
that its expensive inequably administered that
david cuts his eyes briefly to constance
that we may even be killing innocents
constance rolls her eyes
the governor is ready for this
all righty mr
gale ill play your game
name one innocent man texas has put to death in my tenure
david doesnt respond
name one in the last twenty years
in any state in this country
a long miserable beat
dead men cant make a case
well as my daddy used to say if you cant find a problem there probably isnt one
constance shakes her head in irritation
the show is over
david and the governor are shaking hands
constance stands nearby
well you certainly had me on that hitler quote
thank you governor
these debates are awfully good for the state dont you think
well ive got to buzz
she moves toward her handlers
you folks keep up the good work
we need that opposition
constances and davids polite smiles follow her
constance and david argue as they walk the sidewalk to the parking lot
your exact words were just tell me when my ego gets in the way of the work
now im telling you your egos in the way of work
indicating the station look i wanted you to do this anyway
you put up precisely two seconds of protest at the thought of a televised debate
whats that supposed to mean
it means deathwatch suffers because youre so anxious to finger authority to publicly prove that david gale is so much fucking smarter than the powers that be
learn to work without an audience
try squeezing money from the donor list
have you ever licked one single mail out envelope
they come to the end of the sidewalk where two suits are standing one hispanic one white s
look guys theres not much more to say rameriz austin police
this is officer haslinger
the officers show their ids
constance takes one to examine it more closely
what arguing with the governor is a crime
the officers exchange a look
no sir rape is
constance and david look at each other stunned
camera quickly cranes up and rotates
camera cranes down and rotates ending upright by bitsey as she listens to david
over the loudspeaker gale times up
the speaker loud as ever startles bitsey
david nods over to the guards booth
berlin had my bite marks bruises ripped clothing
my skin was beneath her nails
it didnt look like anything but rape
two days later she called the d
said she wouldnt testify too drunk to be sure etc
on the plane home sharon read about her husbands rape case being dropped
whyd she do it
a guard approaches
david stands up and moves to the back of his cage puts his hands behind him and out the slot in the back to be handcuffed
shrugs finger authority show she was smarter than the powers that be
do you know where i can find her
first year in here i received a card postmarked san francisco
it wasnt signed but i suspect it was from her the front had the text sex is power
cuffed david stands aside for the cage door to be opened
anything written on it
it said im sorrier than you can know
exiting the cage see you tomorrow ms
bitsey and zack are walking from the kettle to their rooms
zack is lighting a cigarette
the rains stopped but the lot is wet
try phone records a net search
fucking better than watching you work
they walk a beat in silence
you think hes telling the truth
dont ask me that
i dont know
there is no truth only perspectives
cant say that
if you say there is no truth youre claiming its true that there is no truth its a logical contradiction
working on our philosophy merit badge zack
i on the other hand think gales telling the truth
they come to the stairs and start up
this you know telepathically
its just my perspective
in a dark corner of the parking lot sits the pickup from the rest area
the older cowboy watches bitsey and zack climb the stairs
on his stereo puccini plays
once they are in their rooms he turns up the opera closes his eyes feels the music
the car moves through an older austin suburb with wood framed houses circa in varying states of repair
its an overcast day
zack drives slowly searching
bitsey has the passenger seat fully reclined lies with her eyes closed
thirty three o what
then check out the crime scene in austin
you made it sound so close
shit two and half hours and that damn lig bitsey
she looks up
zack is pointing at house which needs paint and a lawn mower
in front of the house is a homemade sign which reads david gale death house and museum see where it happened
beneath are the opening hours someone has marked them out and scribbled ring bell
they share a look
bitsey rings the bell
zack stomps out a cigarette points out a worn block home sign in the window raises his eyebrows
as bitsey straightens her skirt the door is opened by a goth girl probably not quite eighteen
she has jet black hair nose piercings tattoos a nine inch nails t shirt
metal music comes from within
the goth girl just looks at them
after an uncomfortable silence bitsey extends her hand
im bitsey bloom and this is zack stemmons
we you want the tour
her voice is slacker monotone
theres a twenty dollar mandatory donation apiece
but you get a re enactment photo packet
its got five pictures
i gotta collect first
bitsey reaches in her bag
the room is dark messy with an old couch and tv vcr
a kitchen is adjacent
the walls are full of goth bric a brac london batcave poster one from burtons frankenweenie a couple of fan zine pictures of siouxsie and the banshees
in one corner is a very expensive stereo from which the cure plays
in another a dead plant
the goth girl turns the music down
a table near the door has numbered photos beneath a torn and curling sheet of plastic
small packets of snapshots sit on the table along with a few hand labelled videos and a book of clippings
theres also a guest book
you gotta sign the book
doesnt have to be your real name though
bitsey signs in
first page says youre here to do research on violent crime
the state requires it for nonprofit shit
zack signs in
take a re enactment photo packet
bitsey does so
as does zack
if you guys could share one it would be really cool
the butt wipes where i do prints kinda jerk my chain
zack puts his back
bitsey is looking at a photo the goth girl in her panties and bra laying on the floor with plastic wrap over her head
shes handcuffed and wearing a platinum blonde wig
the pose is half corpse half pinup
my boyfriend took it
we also did a video
its fifty bucks cause you can see my tits
theres a version without tits thats thirty five
zack looks at a video hand labelled constance harraway murder with breasts
do many people take the tour
not so much anymore
we thought this would be like a busy week gale gettin the prune juice and all
prune juice is what death row dudes call the poison cause it gives you the shits
most jerks just take a photo from the street
they shot a real crimes episode here but the owner didnt give us dick
you dont mind living here
im cool with ghouls
beats livin with my dickwad parents
it starts over here
she takes them to the coffee table
among her own things a dusty johnny walker black label bottle sits beside a tumbler an index card with the leans against it
the area has been outlined on the table with white shoe polish
she let him crash here sometimes
he was like constantly wasted
drank black label religiously
bitsey and zack exchange a look
the goth girl moves into the kitchen
its cluttered and dirty except in the various areas which at one point had been outlined and indexed the cards are all dirty
a sliding glass door leads onto the patio
the backyard hasnt been mowed in years roughly twenty pots with dead plants lying around
by the door three small taped xs are on the floor outlined and indexed
this is where the tripod was
my boyfriend borrowed the one we usually show folks
they never found a camera photos or videos or anything
gale must have buried them
these serial killer dudes take photos to whack off to later
hes not exactly a serial killer
she moves to the sink
on the linoleum the position of constances body has been chalk lined
in this area are a pair of handcuffs
not far off is a roll of packing tape
a pair of latex kitchen gloves are crumpled on the sink counter
she was like totally naked right here
the meter man saw her through the door
gale handcuffed her taped her mouth then taped a bag over her head so she couldnt breathe
my boyfriend says thats probably when he fucked her
your muscles tense up when you die the sex is better
pointing he used those housewife gloves so he wouldnt leave prints
they found sticky stuff from the tape on them
zack picks up the gloves
we ask folks not to touch the exhibit
he puts them back
the totally sick part was where they found the key we know you can save that
where was it
it was in her stomach dude
he made her swallow it before he bagged her
thats pretty much the highlight
they are on the two lane highway to huntsville
zack smokes out the window
it was in the case file
fuck in her stomach
thats colder than wisconsin
looking in the rearview mirror zack open your vanity
the vanity mirror pull it down
he does so
see that truck behind us
isnt that the cowboy from the rest area
they look in their respective mirrors
some distance behind them is the older cowboy in his pickup
weird coincidence huh
turning coincidences are always weird thats why theyre coincidences
bitsey sits in front of david
hes less animated than the day before drained
he rubs his wrists
they are speaking in hushed tones
off the record
alright were off
constance was murdered with whats called the securitat method
youre hand cuffed forced to swallow the key taped at the mouth a bags sealed over your head and youre left to suffocate
the securitat did this to romanians who wouldnt inform or confess
sometimes the bag was ripped off at the last second you got a second chance
if not you die knowing the key to your freedom was inside you the whole time
a cheap but effective metonym
problem is i mentioned the method in an early article
the prosecution never knew
youre telling me someones framing you
its more than that
there was a tripod
right facing her body
are we on
nods agreement not a single print was found on it
someone brought it wiped it left it
its as if they wanted me to know that somewhere theres a record of what really happened that afternoon
as if they wanted me to die knowing the key to my freedom was
maybe youre being paranoid
im an anti death row activist on death row
doesnt that strike you as odd
any ideas who they are
but i have someone on it someone im hoping will one day find an answer
belyeus hired a detective
he shakes his head
it takes bitsey a second to understand
mimicking belyeu shes a smart one
david and constance stand by the double doors
hes concentrated shes biting her lip
theyre looking onto a large parking lot
the lot is practically empty except for sharon and chase who stand near their jeep
its packed with various household items things not entrusted to movers
ill drop by your office after
he nods and goes out
as david approaches them chase runs to them still carrying cloud dog
he jumps on his dad
wear me like a fur daddy
wear me like a fur
as he walks david drapes the boy sideways over his shoulders like a fur
chase squeals with pleasure
whos your hero
chase bonks him on the nose
david sets chase down when he reaches his wife
he kiss him goodbye as the boy struggles to move on to something else
a long beat as david and his wife stand uncomfortably
call me when you get to boston
i wish you dont
she turns and walks to the jeep
the doors open
chase get in sweetie
chase climbs in sits in the drivers seat
turning to his dad see ya later alli gator
after awhile crocodile
take it easy japa ne se
okey dokey artichokey
to chase scoot
chase scoots over to the passenger seat
sharon gets in the drivers seat
i sent you an e mail
just read it
she closes the door
suddenly chase opens the passenger side door runs around the jeep carrying cloud dog
he runs to his dad hugs him one last time
cracking her window come on chase
chase starts to go back turns and hands david his cloud dog without comment
he then quickly runs back around the jeep and gets in
david watches them drive away
chases hand waves out the window until they are out of the parking lot
with an e mail message david i want a divorce
im sorry to say it so plainly but thats how i feel it
i dont need time to think this whole rape thing has only forced
david sits in front of his computer staring into space
the office is institutional cramped
books line the walls fill the desk
theres a framed poster warhol style of socrates
he reaches into his desk for a bottle of black bush and fills his glass
theres a knock on the door
you could at least hide the bottle
david closes the e mail
she collapses in the chair opposite his desk exhausted
officially youre on sabbatical
unofficially they want you to look for another position
it was four to two
a beat as he absorbs the information
how did ross vote
youre not supp
against my politics
david mouths a thank you
a century real estate agent is putting a for sale sign in the front yard
david is having lunch with an ivy league looking male in his fifties
only water and bread are on the table
so i wanted to get your feedback on the idea
the ivy leaguer vigorously butters his bread
look professor gale i could sit here as im sure others have and plead departmental cutbacks
claim you need more publications or i need a minority whatever
all bull geschichte
your records brilliant
youre an original voice worth in the scarcity defines value capitalist system under which we toil your weight in gold
hell its not even the alcohol
itd be nice to have faculty whose crutch wasnt prozac
but to speak plainly if i hire you in the eyes of the regents alumni and every freshman with an ear for gossip id be hiring a rapist
he takes a bite of bread
youre not politically correct dr
welcome to the club
david stands on the balcony of a sparsely furnished a month apartment
books are stacked everywhere
an interstate runs nearby
he holds a phone looks down in the pool area
a horribly tanned man in his seventies wearing a speedo attempts to do tai chi
on his moms answering machine we arent home
please tell us a message
cueing him in the b
at the beep
at the peep
david lets the phone beep just stares down at the man saying nothing
as david gets out of his volvo a sorority pledge funny clothes greek letters on her cheek quickly approaches
she takes his picture with a polaroid camera
she runs to a waiting convertible where two other girls sit
i got it
i got it
she jumps in the car and they speed away
the office is philip stark chic with large window walls austin stretches into the distance
david sits on a sofa across from an exceedingly attractive woman early s
what exactly attracts you to the bond market
hes staring into space
he looks at her
she forces a strained smile
david lies on the floor his head propped against a wall
hes in his underwear and drinking from a black bush bottle
the phones beside his ear and chases message on his wifes machine tweaks out of the receiver speaker
after the beep david hangs up gets a dial tone and punches re dial
the message starts again
after the beep he hangs up gets a dial tone and punches re dial
david is in the office of an overdressed yuppie black man early s
david is doing his active listening thing
over articulating now mr
gale i want you to tell me three personal qualities you have that would make you a successful radio shack manager
david and belyeu approach a ball fifty feet from the green
because divorce proceedings do not require her presence in the country
for a custody hearin yeah shell have to return
david chooses a club
but without successful completion of an alcohol treatment program youll be lucky to get the odd thanksgivin
david walks to the ball
so my chances of getting partial custody arent good
roughly the same as you sinkin that from here
david looks at him then concentrates on the ball suddenly it has meaning
the ball lands in a water trap
davids volvo winds up the road enters through a gate
a sign beside the gate the go lightly a recovery clinic
its a beautiful day
the house looks much different than in the goth girls care flower bed well manicured lawn fresh paint
the block home sign is in the window
davids volvo pulls up in front
constance opens the door for david
hes wearing a short sleeved radio shack shirt and tie
shes taken aback
looks at him a beat bites her lip suppresses a laugh
he plays hurt then they both burst out laughing
she hugs him as they laugh on the porch
the living room is now laura ashley cozy
the sliding door is open so the rooms sunny breezy
constance leads david in
she looks tired but is animated a bit too much so
her hair is different
you look good
she smiles at him maternally touches his face
they hug again
lightly in his arms i need you
deathwatch needs you now more than ever
nothing like i need you both
youre all i have
she moves from him takes a photo from a case file on her kitchen table
jo ann johnsons been re scheduled
of a young black women pleasant timid
ive got a call with hawkins tonight and if national will commit emergency funds
she lifts a small plant moves to the porch
jo ann will be commuted and youll only prove the system works
he notices she has bruises on her arms
but ill save a life
referring to the bruises whered you get those
she went up at shes now
she sets the plant down among others
at the very back of the yard the older cowboy spades in a vegetable garden
calling to the cowboy hey
she ever not make you work when you come by
raising his spade in greeting mornin david
turning to constance whats her story
i really want us to get behind this one
shes articul constance who did she kill
constance looks at him a beat sighs
she admit to it
contance sheepishly nods
youre a crazy woman
not your medium grade thinks shes teddy roosevelts bathrobe but stark raving loose screws in the belfry insane
youre mixing metaphors
a real danger to flora and fauna
are we gonna do this
the smile and how
he kisses her on the forehead hes surprised
youre burning up
david exits the store carrying four large coffees in a cup container tries to sip one without spilling the others
hes still wearing the radio shack shirt seems happier
in the parking lot a hip high schooler jumps out of his camero and moves toward the store
as david comes in front of the car he sees his former baby sitter sitting in the passenger seat
their eyes meet
she smiles back waves
as he passes he hears the girl hit the cars automatic david enters carrying the coffee
the matron sits on a desk licking envelopes
the college guy is on the floor beneath a desk rewiring a computer terminal
calling from beneath a desk howdy mr
david goes to the matron gives her cup and three sweet lows
my this is service
he takes one of the unsealed envelopes from her stack then puts a cup beside the legs of the college guy
latte on your left partner
david makes his way to the back office
the college guy gives the matron a look theyre surprised pleased
constance sits at a spartan desk
nothing is on the walls though a window opens onto the alley behind
shes talking on the speaker phone with the deathwatch national director a social gathering is going on behind him
and see what kind of resources the religious groups can deliver
david comes through the door
she waves him in
im sure we can get some pulpit time maybe cable
he sets her coffee in front of her
then sits across from her
listen i need to run
for now i agree the first press release should focus on the womans youth
david holds up the envelope for constance to see then animatedly licks and seals it
he then literally pats himself on the back
ill have the washington people look into counsel competency though im almost sure shes exhausted this issue on appeal
she smiles at him shakes her head
to the phone john davids going to oh i almost forgot
hes not around is he
constance hesitates looks at david
he shakes his head no
good keep it that way
his relationship to deathwatch is over terminated
last thing we need is this rape thing coming back to bite our butts
constance is not sure how to react
david just stares at her
these guys dont stay on the wagon for very long
david stands up and leaves the room quickly
his coffee spills
constance can only watch
im serious constance
ban him from the premises
i realize you two
constance comes anxiously out the front door
davids volvo pulls out of the parking lot
she stands watching it drive away breathing heavily
she winces grabs her stomach vomits on the sidewalk
the volvo is parked on a seedy southside street
david stands at a phone booth and dials a long distance number and a calling code
he waits impatiently looks across the street theres a liquor store
at his ear chases message begins
he speaks into the phone after the beep
sharon pick up
for once just pick up the goddamn phone
if you keep him in spain ill
im begging you
hes my son
david starts to put the receiver back then suddenly starts smashing it against the phones body he smashes it long after there is anything left to destroy long after his
constance walks with car keys and a large stack of mail toward her front porch
she looks like she hasnt slept in weeks
david is sitting on the porch beneath the block home sign holding cloud dog
he wears the yale sweatshirt the radio shack shirt is wrapped around his injured hand
hes sloppy drunk
were seeking refuse refuge uge
come on come inside
she opens the door as he stands
we fell off our wagon
david enters rambling stands leaning against the back of the couch holding the sheep
know why saint jude is the patron saint of lost causes
cause his real name was judas
there were two judases judai the saint guy and the bad judas who ratted on jesus and tried to kiss him
medievalers wouldnt pray to good judas for fear of getting bad judas on the line by mistake
ergo they only gave him business when really desperate
then they changed his name
shes not in the room
he looks back toward the entry hall
a small flyer lightly blows along the floor into the living room
your mails blowing
he looks in the entry hall
constance lies unconscious on the floor near the open door
the mail is scattered about her
david sleeps in a chair on the floor beside him is a stack of vending machine coffee cups
a typical hospital intercom can be heard throughout the scene
a female doctor mid s sits beside him lightly shakes his shoulder
he wakes groggy
how we doing
a beat as he collects himself sits up
gale a leukemia patients condition is highly susceptible to external stress
while we dont want to totally restrict constances life what
constances illness requires a degree of regularity
constance has leukemia
she was diagnosed last fall
a beat as the situation clarifies for both of them
david is stunned the doctor embarrassed
have i created a problem
they sit in silence
the hospital intercom seems to say gale times up
camera slowly rotates
bitsey stares at david engrossed
when i asked why she hadnt told me she muttered too busy
i guess she figured as long as death was chasing her she could help others escape
he stands goes to the back of the cage to be handcuffed
constance left the world better than she found it
beat its a small difficult thing
the rental car sits in a corner of the mostly empty lot as far as possible from the razor wire fence and exercise pens
zack waits in the drivers seat smoking
he looks nervously through the windshield toward the pens
bitsey raps on the window startling him
zack unlocks the door throws his cigarette out
bitsey opens the door and gets in
waving her hand at the smoke for gods sake zack
youre not a happy camper
its not a happy place
he starts the car
talked to the austin prosecutor
belyeus a yokel
prosecutor says he fucked up the penalty phase says gale probably would have gotten life on mitigating factors
gale stuck with him though all through appeals despite major pro bono offers
notta on berlin we pick up the money in houston tonight overheat light came on twice and youre about to get a surprise
i dont want a surprise
pointing ahead too late
the guardhouse is now occupied
the crossing guard is down
across the drive sits a texas highway patrol car
all along the drives left side protest vehicles are parked in the grass
they stretch out to the two lane highway where another highway patrol car is stationed
the drives right side is also marked off though the only vehicle on this side is a houston tv news truck
six people in ponchos discuss something in the middle of the drive
the rental car enters the frame
bitsey and zack approach the guardhouse
this is mostly an oklahoma caravan
i got stuck behind them on the way in
the guardhouse attendant looks in waves them through as the crossing guard lifts
executions not for another hours
its gonna be a zoo
theres the p
standing among the six people in ponchos is duke grover
they pass him in slow motion
he sees them smiles makes a hello shooting gesture
what a life waiting around for someone to die
the next to last vehicle on the left is the older cowboys pickup
he sits inside talking with another man
the older cowboy sees them touches his hat as they pass
this is a little too coincidental
the rental car passes a farmhouse
bitsey and zack are headed to huntsville
cause i couldnt see the license plate
what time is it
why dont you have a watch
its a long story
the rental car passes a black teenager hitchhiking in front of an abandoned vegetable stand
bitsey and zack make their way to their rooms
zacks is first
give me an hour
zack unlocks his door enters
the rooms a mess papers everywhere
he walks toward a portable computer sitting on the room desk
zack runs from the room
zack runs towards bitsey
she stands outside her room
maybe the maid forgot
as he comes to her door he sees what shes indicating between the door and its frame someone has stuck a roll of duct tape
bitsey pushes the door open looks in and around
she sees something enters
zack enters behind her sees what she sees
ill check the bathroom
she approaches the middle of the room
the room in contrast to zacks is perfectly neat
it has two twin beds
the nightstand has been moved to the center
on it is a lamp turned on
suspended just above the lamp a vhs cartridge hangs from the ceiling by fishing line
zack checks behind the shower curtain
clear in here
dont touch it
as zack enters he sees bitsey holding the vhs cassette
fuck bitsey there could have been prints
she holds up the cassette
it has a label typed from an old typewriter for bitsey bloom
zack runs out the front door carrying a vcr the cables drag the ground behind him
he runs toward the rooms
bitsey unlocks the door lets zack in
she says no one asked for you
and all the room keys are different
he goes to the tv
just she and her husband have masters
what did you tell her
that you have a jealous boyfriend
he starts to hook up the vcr
how about the v
she didnt ask
i think she assumed it had something to do with why he was jealous
i still say we should do this in my room this ones a fucking crime scene
whoever got in here without a key in broad daylight was probably smart enough not to leave prints
i have the remote
he turns on the tv
maybe they could look for d
hitting the remote they dont look for d
when someone breaks in to deliver zack
she hands him the tape
he starts to put it in hesitates looks back at her
you sure you want to see whats on here
he puts it in pushes play
she sits on the bed
he sits beside her
they watch the black leader appear
i hope this isnt what i think it is
an image flickers in
its a woman lying nude on the kitchen floor of house facing away from the camera
an opaque white kitchen bag is over her head sealed at the neck with duct tape
her hands are handcuffed behind her
she appears dead
is it her
turn it up
they stare at the screen she bites a thumbnail
he turns the sound up
hi video the woman does not move
the kitchen is cleaner than weve seen it but otherwise unchanged
kitchen gloves can be seen laid upside down and inside out on the dish rack beside the sink
near the body on the floor is a roll of duct tape
in the lower right corner of the screen is part of what looks like a towel
the audio is full of atmospheric hum
a refrigerator contributes
birds can barely be heard in the distance so can what sounds like a lawn mower
suddenly the woman makes a muffled sound seems to come to life
her wrists start to pull against the handcuffs then jerk at them
he legs flail kick against the counter
she screams muffled frantic
she rolls onto her stomach her whole body fights against the cuffs
she desperately rubs her face along the linoleum trying to rip the plastic
soon her energy wanes she jerks less
her covered face now points toward the camera
her head seems to rock a sleepy nod
her body goes slack
bitsey stands at the railing looking out at the interstate and a thunderstorm gathering on the horizon
after a few seconds zack comes up beside her
belyeu says to bring the tape first thing tomorrow
also said you were right about not calling the police
a beat she keeps looking straight on
are you gonna be okay
bitsey takes a deep breath turns to him holds his eyes
she shakes her head no
her lips start to tremble
he puts his arms around her as she starts to cry
bitsey and zack sit at a booth having coffee
the vhs cassette is also between them as is a small stack of crumpled tissues
the thunderstorm can be heard in the distance
the waitress is refilling their cups and they wait until she leaves
lets say gales right
some sick fuck agatha christie wannabe set him up arranged like the perfect murder
why send a magazine journalist proof a few hours before hes won
doesnt make sense
no its perfect
he knows news magazine wont give the scoop to the dailies or nightly news not after having paid for it
probably guessed we wouldnt call the cops
and most importantly knows ill tell gale tomorrow
why does he give a shit
zack what if harraways murder was just a means to getting gale
i mean sending him through hell a sick cat and mouse game
you kill the one person he has left
make sure he sits six years on death row for the murder a place hes made a public career of loathing
and then just let him die die knowing everyone will remember him with disgust
you destroy his loved ones his lifes work his memory and you make him watch
thats a lot of hate
youre talking beyond sadism
bitsey gestures to the tape makes a need i say more face
then why release it
if the mouse dies the games over
maybe the cats enjoying himself
picks up the tape imagine walking to the chamber knowing this exists
the cat is a fucking psychopath
yeah but smart
the storm batters the motel
we see bitseys dark front window
a figure stands looking out
its bitsey intently watching the night
on the back seat is an aluminum suitcase
zack sits beside it looking out the back window
its still raining hard
theyre on the two lane highway to austin
why do they call it check book journalism if we always pay cash
the over heat light is on
sadist at six oclock
is it the truck
the cowboys truck can be seen through the tire mist fifty yards behind them
yep and doing a lousy job of hiding
bitsey watches in the rearview mirror
zack out the back window
he must think were idiots
you think hes our fucked up feline
bitsey doesnt respond just watches in the mirror then is he gaining
just sitting back there
can you see the license
too much mist
what the fuck does this guy want
the office has a view of the rain soaked capital
dark woods and deep carpets belyeus practice is clearly thriving
a sharp looking clerk sits at a corner table counting money from the aluminum suitcase
bitsey sits on a huge sofa
belyeu stands just outside his door
oh and bring in miss blooms original when thats done
entering to bitsey dont blame you for not watching that twice
he goes to his desk and starts sifting through papers
i couldnt sleep afterwards
i generally tell folks im no more afraid of the grim reaper than i am of a presbyterian on mothers day
but watching your tape
i had to keep tellin myself thats not constance just to get through
a beat unfortunately others may argue the same
yeah but its her kitchen in her house
currently home to weirdos incorporated
arguably that tape could have been made by anybody with twenty dollars and a tolerance for vulgarity
but it will at least get us a postponement
i hope so miss bloom i certainly hope so
but youve got to remember that theres a machine a runnin
and come six oclock tomorrow mornin that machine wants to be fed
the clerk puts the last of the money back into the suitcase
all here mr
to the clerk thank you joshua
to bitsey to add to our troubles your own credibility may come into question
the clerk exits
youve been fraternizin with the condemned
in the courts eyes hes the most likely candidate to have put you onto the tape
hes a persuasive man youre a out of state woman it dont look good on paper
but someone put it in my hotel room
a fact for which we have no evidence
a very professional looking assistant enters hands bitsey her video
thank you bobbi
standing well lets not start readin kafka just yet
could we find a sympathetic judge
ill file within the hour
you headin back over to ellis
ill call over at the motel later and give you an update
bitsey comes out of two huge oak doors walks past a gold belyeu and crane sign
she turns a corner
at the end of another short hall she comes to the elevator pushes the call button
as she waits she looks out an adjacent window at the capital in the rain
she remembers something looks down she has her purse but no umbrella
she heads back toward belyeus office
as she turns the corner she sees the older cowboy enter the belyeu and crane office
bitsey hurries umbrella less through the rain to the rental car parked in the loading zone
bitsey opens the door
zacks in the passenger seat
she doesnt bother to sit
did you see the cowboy go in
he went in belyeus building
into his office
just saw him
find out who he is where he lives what he how are you gonna get to ellis
zack makes a face
a taxi makes its way through the hundreds of protesters and press that now gather along the drive
bitsey wet and hugging herself paces in front of david
you have to sit
over the loudspeaker visitors need to stay seated
to the microphone above sorry
to bitsey look at me
hes not your man
his name is dusty wright deathwatch director before constance
hes a bullhorner a zealot who thinks a good demonstration has to end in a riot and arrests
almost martyrs dont mean shit
they fired him
constance kept him in the organization and he loved her for it
the man adored her
then why was he following us
why was he at belyeu and crane
he and benny used to work a
cases together until dusty punched a clansman in a federal court
benny sometimes still gives him work probably had him follow you
david looks up at the microphone
to make sure you honored your agreement one for which theres no contract
he wouldve said something
hes a lawyer ms
maybe dusty was jealous because you were seeing constance
i wasnt seeing constance
she had your sperm its more complicated than that
david sits in a lawn chair beside his volvo
the tailgates down serving as a makeshift table for a coffee thermos and whiskey bottle
david stares off down the alley clearly in pain
he holds a childs drawing
has gaudis church and a matador in background
prominent in the foreground are three labeled figures sharon mommy chase me and a dark haired man papa jorge
jorge is dressed in a tux sharon seems to wear a bridal gown
the atmosphere is tense
dusty wright sits on a deskholding a red magic marker the matron sits behind it
they look at the college guy who closely watches a computer screen
in the center of the room a middle aged priest sits and quietly prays while holding the hands of an overweight woman she murmurs quiet affirmations
finally the college guy looks up at dusty nods
the rooms occupants all exchange glances
dusty walks to the photo wall marks a cross through the photo of jo ann johnson then walks to the back office
constance wrapped in an afghan sleeps on a futon
shes shockingly anemic
dusty kneels beside her watches her sleep
after a beat she wakes with a slight jolt like someone whose been fighting to stay awake
she looks at him then sees the marker in his hand
she looks away
all i can feel is envy
dusty stands goes to the alley window
davids volvo is parked just outside the window
david sits in a lawn chair behind it
david looks awful
in the window dusty holds up the marker
david sits on the porch holding a drink a bottle of black bush in the chair beside him
hes staring at nothing
constance comes out the open sliding glass door wearing a turtleneck sweater and wrapped in her afghan
she goes to the chair beside him picks up the bottle and sits
they silently survey the yard the sunset
she hugs the bottle he sips his drink
remember those kubler ross stages the ones the dying go through
denial anger bargaining depression and acceptance
where are you
denials my personal favorite
the whole idea of there being a process makes me tired
im not up to the job of dying person
marveling at blades of grass
lecturing strangers to relish every moment
take that back
i wish i had a child
im sorry david
she reaches over and puts her hand on his arm
i guess i just wish i would have risked more
she has the bottle in her other hand looks at it takes a swig
making a face swallowing hard uumm also not enough sex
should have had more sex
she puts the bottle down beside her chair
how many lovers have you had
her hand on his arm holds up four fingers
yeah you should have had more sex
she laughs coughs
their laughter trails off into the yard
he takes her hand in his
you work hard not to be seen as a sex object
before long youre not seen at all
i see you
they are holding hands in the air their elbows on the chairs armrests
want to make it five
finish the hand
a pity lay
they watch their fingers lightly play with one another
it wouldnt be pity
they turn their eyes meet hold
constance and david are in bed making love
hes on top one hand supports her head the other strokes her face
they tenderly kiss
he starts moving gently
are you okay
he kisses her neck
moves up to her ear
talk to me
let me hear your voice
in her ear im here
im very happy
he kisses her mouth moves against her in delicate rhythm
her moans take on a teary edge
their voices breathless whispers meld into one another
hold me tight
shes begun to cry
he stops moving kisses her tears
stay in me
please stay in me
he moves again slowly
i need to feel you inside
im not pulling out
im so tired
i know i know
tired of being afraid
make it stop
the house is dark
a light in one of the rooms comes on
shes awake as david enters
he opens the curtains sets a glass of water beside bottles on the nightstand
he crawls on top of the covers spoons her nuzzles the back of her head
how do you feel about last night
like i have a reason to get out of bed
david goes to the pay phone against the building
constance stands in a bathrobe beside her shower
turns the water on
shes caught in a thought bites her lip
she turns the water off
david sits in a lounger speaking to someone on his right
lets say they move back from spain that i somehow got my one weekend a month
would it matter
by high school id be his weak spot the focus of locker room jabs embarrassed pride
in college thered be late night angst what if i turn out like the old man
holidays would be forced smiles and unscheduled exits
i mean what girl comes home with you if theres talk that pops is a rapist
i cant stand the idea of being his model of failure
without him i drink
to cover the hole
to prove to myself hes better off without me
camera pulls back to reveal dusty wright sitting in the lounger beside him
constance still in her robe puts an armful of sheets in the washing machine
she feels faint
david sits in a swing set rocks slowly
hes simply looking at the house
a yuppie woman opens the back door
standing sorry just leaving
constance is quickly sorting through a box of memorabilia a photo catches her attention
constance on vacation in a caribbean resort
she sits alone at a dinner table looks to camera seems surprised to be photographed
as constance contemplates the photo she hears the doorbell ring
we see david lying in the grass of recently cut lawn
david in the car in a mall parking lot staring at nothing
on the seat beside him is cloud dog and a half empty black bush bottle
davids asleep using cloud dog as a pillow
the bottle is empty
a light flashes in on him waking him
theres a knock on the window its the police
hes blinded by the flashlight
the policeman holds the light
a loudspeaker voice gale times up
but there has to be someone
someone with a motive who knew you both
someone who visited that morning
if i could answer
we wouldnt be having this conversation
its why i need you why i chose you
you have my story now
mimicking her delivery go
theres not enough time
the guard approaches
youll find time
you know thats not what i meant
you should have done this earlier
youre not here to save me
youre here to save my sons memory of his father thats all i want
youre going to let them kill you
david moves to the back of the cage to be handcuffed
we live to stop death
eating inventing loving praying fighting killing choose a verb
all to stall this evil jobs king of terrors
but what do we really know about it
nobody comes back
theres a point when your mind out lives its obsessions when your habits survive your dreams when your losses
you wonder maybe death is a gift
all i know is that by this time tomorrow ill be better off
what i dont know is why
exits the cage goodbye bitsey
the guard escorts him away
when hes out of earshot softly goodbye david
a guard hangs up a phone and leans out the door
cars on its way
wanna wait in here
bitsey stands in the rain
behind her hundreds of protesters flank the drive
she turns and walks toward the highway
the parade tape has been replaced with crowd barriers
the drives left side now overflows with abolitionists they cluster beneath tarps some sing hymns others paint signs dont kill with my taxes
mark murder doesnt stop murder
beneath one umbrella stands a large black woman holding a candle she watches bitsey
the right side is a media circus
various pro death penalty activists also cluster here
they too have prepared signs rape and suffocate him
thank jesus for justice lets do it
a blackboard keeps a countdown hours
at the end of the drive on the left bitsey sees a sign leaning against a camper save david gale
it catches rain its letters run
the restaurants crowded
a church of christ couple s eat without comment
the mans t shirt reads its simple you kill you get killed
in the booth beside them sit bitsey and zack their dinners largely untouched
bitsey watches three sleazy journalists at a table not far from theirs
i got it
i got it
you could have corporate sponsors
volkswagen for bundy home depot for gacy
and the david gale execution brought to you by
they find this hilarious
bitsey looks away
what time is it
checking his watch nine hours minutes
as bitsey and zack hurry toward their rooms they see belyeu getting out of his cadillac
he carries bitseys umbrella and opens his own
he turns comes toward them
bitsey holds a newspaper over her head zack slouches
did you have dusty wright follow us
i employ mr
wright from time to time
you could have said something
opening her umbrella that would have defeated the purpose
apologies if i caused you unnecessary anxiety but im paid to be suspicious
handing it to her thought id return this
any word on the writ
tape went to a federal judge two hours ago
your videographer friend made contact
what you got was definitely a snippet
could be he has more previews scheduled
best stick close to your room
im headed back over
tell him ill take care of it about his son i mean
well talk later
they turn from one another
bitsey turns back
calling after him mr
were dusty and constance close
thick as thieves
bitsey and zack sit on either side of the rooms table looking out the window
rain shadows run down their faces
the room phone is on the table as is zacks watch
the rains lightened up
the motels full
lights are on in ten of the motel rooms
the kettles lights go off one after another
zack sleeps at the end of one bed fully dressed
bitsey lost in agitated thought neatly packs a suit into her perfectly arranged suitcase
she stops thinks
she goes to her purse and takes out the vhs cassette a pen and a note pad
hesitating a beat she puts the tape in the vcr
she turns on the tv and waits for an image
all the rooms except bitseys are dark
from within comes a tv glow
shes sketched a flow chart of the tape with major elements timed out
has her shoes off sits on the floor with her back against a bed
shes still watching the tape tired exasperated
finally she turns the tv off rubs her eyes
she stands looks at the radio alarm clock on the nightstand
bitsey brushes her teeth
looks down and sees a towel on the floor
picks it up starts to hang it on the towel rack stops looks at herself in the mirror
an idea hits her first as something odd then as a freight train
she spits hurries into the bedroom
putting on her shoes zack
he starts to pull himself awake
did you throw the towel on the floor
the towel on my bathroom floor
did you put it there
yeah i guess
its a hotel room
what do you do that at home
im sorry its not like its get up
she disconnects the vcr
sitting up what the fucks wrong with you
grab the t
i want to check something
were taking a tour
she has the vcr
grabs her purse on the way to the door
get the t
she opens the door exits
the doorbell rings over bauhaus music
the goth girl wearing only the nine inch nails t shirt opens the door
bitsey barrages past carrying the vcr zack follows with the wanna make a hundred bucks
what do i gotta do
bitsey zack and the goth girl enter
were going over the crime scene
bitsey checks the kitchen
the tripods back
the other exhibit pieces havent changed
and for the next hour i want you to do exactly what i say when i say to do it
if i say suck zacks dick all i want to hear from you is may i swallow
you want me to suck his dick
its just a patriarchal figure of speech
is your boyfriend here
he aint exactly my boyfriend anymore
well is his video camera here
she starts to leave turns back
i gotta collect first
bitsey moaning reaches for her purse
zacks hand enters the frame turns the music video the goth girls messy kitchen
camera zooms in to a perspective similar to that on the constance tape
the exhibit pieces kitchen gloves handcuffs tape roll are more or less where they were before
the goth girl enters the frame shes removing pizza boxes and laundry from the counter
move those index cards too
she picks up the index cards
zack looks up from a video cameras eye piece
the camera is on the tripod connected to the goth girls tv
near it the hotel tv vcr
bitsey cues the constance tape to the beginning freezes the image
zack then checks the camera angle on the goth girls tv
he moves the tvs so that they are side by side
zoom in a hair
he does so
bitsey compares perspectives between the left tv goth girl cleaning to the right tv constance
put the gloves on a dish rack
i dont have one
zack goes to the sink lays three pizza boxes on the counter as an ersatz dish rack he drapes the kitchen gloves over them
turn them inside out
he does so
move the tape roll about a foot to the left
and get rid of the handcuffs
zack repositions the tape
the goth girl picks up the handcuffs
come check this zack
to the goth girl could you
whats your name
nico lie down on the floor facing the counter
zack comes behind the tripod and looks at the tvs
nico sits on the floor starts to take off her t shirt
we can imagine that part
to bitsey ill position her
he goes to nico arranges her in the position of constance which now bears no relation to the white outline on the floor
just straighten her legs
zack comes back behind the tripod
he and bitsey look at the two tv images roughly the same
the constance tape however shows what looks like a white towel in the lower right hand corner
bitsey points to it
towel or something
okay look at this
she plays the tape of constance for eight seconds
i noticed this back at the hotel
bitsey touches the tv screen by one of constances feet
the foot moves ever so slightly
she hits pause
she moves her foot
fucking good question
its another fifteen seconds before she comes to
if she had passed out once without fresh air she wouldnt come back
there was no head trauma her blood tested normal jesus maybe she was faking hoping he would go away
bitsey looks up at nico
weve got to bag her
not a good idea
all right ill do it
nico hurries from the bedroom into the kitchen
bitsey and zack stand by the sink
a white plastic bag is now on the sink counter beside it the roll of duct tape
i found it
nico hands zack the key to the handcuffs
he tests them then lays them on the counter
to zack okay i want you to wait three minutes before you take it off
bitsey im not so sure about this
three full minutes
just stand behind the tripod
both of you
zack and nico move behind the tripod
bitsey puts the bag on her head rips off a long length of tape
she seals the bag around her neck
she then handcuffs herself from behind with some difficulty
is on the sink counter while she does this
through the bag have you started
twenty two seconds
bitsey sits on the linoleum then lies on her side
bitsey lies perfectly still
maybe she shouldnt
bitsey starts to pull slightly at the cuffs
this isnt cool
one forty fi
bitsey panics fights like hell against the cuffs
through the bag zack
zack runs to her knocking the tripod over
he rips the bag open
she sucks air
ripping at the tape jesus fucking christ bitsey
what if idve waited
she tries to catch her breath
nico releases the handcuffs
no more fucking experiments all right
just tell me whats going on
bitsey nods holds up her hand wants to say something
she takes his arm looks at him
still breathing heavily she
she did it herself
zack sits on the couch holding the handcuffs and smoking
nico sits on one of its armrests
bitsey full of adrenaline paces in front of them thinking out loud
she used the gloves to keep fingerprints off the tape and bag
then she put them back on the dish rack but upside down and inside out a housewives habit
a murderer would have just tossed them aside like they were the first time we were here like you do a towel in a hotel
maybe all right maybe
indicating the cuffs but why wear these
they threw me
i forgot you have to have the key to put them on
but she needed them
she knew she would instinctively try to rip the bag off that at some point automatism would kick in
fuckin a like when people hang themselves
at the last second they go chicken claw at the rope and shit
the police find their own skin beneath their nails
and she swallowed the key so she couldnt get to it
she made sure there was no way out
woa chill chill
why not hang yourself or take pills
why take your fucking clothes off
why make it look like a murder
its so calculated
shes handcuffed taped at the mouth
the damn tripod
why fake your own murder
i dont know
motives like a major issue here
it doesnt make sense
the womans a bleeding heart abolitionist
why frame an innocent man
why send gale to the chair for what looks whatd you say
she had to know some innocent fuck would take the fall
oh my god zack thats it
to prove it happens
to have absolute proof that the system convicts innocents
get the fuck out of here
no thats how she thought
she lived for deathwatch
if shes gonna die why not die for it
thats why the tripod was here
to record proof undeniable proof the tape
thats why we got an out take
a dead woman put the tape in your room
of course not
she needed help someone to keep it release it
someone she could trust someone dedicated to the cause
they stare at each other a beat
the same thought mimicking belyeu thick as thieves
dusty looks up at a wall clock
he sits fully dressed in his living room listening to an opera
he closes his eyes
camera pulls back out of his window and into behind a couple of trees near the woods edge bitsey and zack hide watching him
she turns back into the woods
bitsey and zack emerge from the woods near the rental car
they walk and speak quickly in the light rain
because of the berlin thing constance knew the police would go straight to gale
in a way hes perfect
a high profile alcoholic whose life was shit anyway
she was in love with him
i dont know
they were close
she wouldnt want him dead
they come to the car get in
remember this thing about dusty being a bull horner going to far
why he was fired from deathwatch and the a
maybe the plan was for dusty to release the tape after gales conviction after a year or so
you know force him to dry out let him play the heroic victim give him back his dignity
so dusty wrights sitting on this tape waiting the only one who knows about it
and maybe good ole dusty starts to think that an erroneous execution is a hell of a lot more politically useful than a last minute save
which would only prove the system works
almost martyrs dont count
whats one murder to stop thousands
so hell wait release the whole tape after the execution
somewhere he must have the original
what time is it
the wall clock
dusty hears the phone ring over a baritones aria
he turns the music down and picks up
the gas station is old isolated on a country road
by the road a single light pole illuminates the area its light catching the drizzle
directly beneath the pole is a phone booth where bitsey waits by the rental car
zack is on the phone with the booth door open
bitsey stands just outside
lets talk about your tape
no meet me at the station down the hill in fifteen minutes
zack hangs up before dusty can respond
he stops out of the booth and gives bitsey a tentative look
dusty hangs up thinks
bitsey sits in the cars driver seat
zack stands by the booth
dont move from the booth
call the second you see the truck
remember let it ring just once
then get into the woods i know
pulling away into the woods zack
bitsey is in the woods watches dusty pull away in the pickup
she hurries to the front door enters
bitsey turns on the lights and begins searching
she sees videos on a bookshelf
some are labeled three arent
she takes the cassettes to the tv vcr
puts one in her hands are wet
she searches for the right av channel
zack anxiously waits
his eyes check the road
bitsey has a picture but the tape is an old tv western
she starts to fast forward realizes she wont be able to do so with each tape hits eject
she checks the clock
she takes another unlabeled tape
its a home video of a city council meeting
hitting eject shit
she grabs the next unlabeled tape
zack paces in front of the booth checks his watch
bitsey has an old i love lucy episode
ejects looks at the label lucy
she grabs another labeled unforgiven
the credits from unforgiven roll on screen
zack sees lights coming toward him
gets into the phone booth drops two coins dials six numbers
he hesitates to punch the seventh checks the road
the approaching lights belong to a car
he quickly hangs up
bitsey is frantic
another tape is an old johnny carson interview with pavarotti
she reaches for another
zack hugs himself in the waning drizzle
fucking come on
bitsey has what looks like an office christmas party
she goes for another tape the last
cheyenne autumn comes up on the screen
she hits eject
she gets up unsure what to do next
she goes back to the bookshelf pulls books out to look behind them for more tapes indifferent to the mess
she goes to a filing cabinet quickly rifles it
she looks around the room sees something
she goes to a large oak desk with an old typewriter on it
after the other drawers she looks in the lap drawer
its empty except for large padded envelope addressed to bitsey bloom news magazine w
new york new york
a beat as she stares in disbelief
she rips it open pulls out a vhs cassette and checks the label constance
the phone rings startling her
she looks at the phone then at the clock
the phone doesnt ring again
a beat of absolute silence
bitsey goes quickly to the vcr and puts in the tape hands shaking
after a few seconds constance appears standing in her kitchen by the sink dressed in a bathrobe
shes wearing the kitchen gloves and fills a glass with water
constance turns from the sink her voice weak ready
the response is silent but she nods
a beat she bites her lower lip
in one quick movement she takes the key from the handcuffs and swallows it with the water
it goes down with difficulty she coughs then signals shes okay
she puts the glass in the sink
she takes the duct tape roll rips off a long section sticks one end to the back of her gloved hand
she tears off another small section drops the roll on the floor
she tapes the small section over her mouth
she then takes the plastic bag from the counter looks at it a beat
constance turns toward camera mouth taped eyes watering
she nods once and turns back
she quickly puts the bag over her head
after she has smoothed the excess air out with one hand she takes the packing tape from the other
she seals the bag around her neck
she smoothly takes off the gloves
theyre inside out and she snaps them so that the fingers extend
she drops them upside down on the dish rack
she removes her robe shes nude beneath and tosses it aside
it lands in the bottom right hand corner of the screen
she feels for the handcuffs on the counter takes them
she sits on the floor cuffs herself
she rolls onto her side perfectly still waiting
the spell breaks as she comes to the part of the tape shes seen before
averting her eyes she fast forwards past where constance struggles to where she dies
constance lies perfectly still
a man wearing gloves walks into the frame dusty
this is what shes needed
dusty goes to constance kneels and removing a glove checks her pulse
he looks briefly up into the camera then stands
he picks up her robe and comes back past the tripod
we see only constances dead body then black
a hand grabs her shoulder
she screams and spins around
its zack breathing hard
he didnt show
bitsey hits the eject button
bitsey and zack hurry out of the cabin and into the woods
the pickup is nowhere to be seen
as they disappear into the trees dusty can be seen standing beneath the eave at the side of the house watching
the car moves full speed through the misty dawn
the drizzle has stopped
the overheat light is on
zack has her purse in his lap rips a page out of her phone book
shes almost in tears yelling
wake up new york the warden the governor the goddamn supreme court death clerk
how far is it
took me this afternoon
youve got maybe more
ill make it
the rental car slides to a near stop on the interstate shoulder
zack jumps out as bitsey spins away again
he runs across the frontage road toward the motel in the mist
the rental car barrels through the empty square ignoring stop signs
the rental car flies past a huntsville city limit sign and disappears into the fog
the overheat light is still on
bitsey looks down then turns on the radio
a country and western song is on
she punches scan
to the radio give me the time
give me the goddamn time
the highway forks off to another
an arrow sign at the fork reads tdc ellis unit miles
bitsey smells something
the rental car smoke pouring from the engine clunks to a dead roll stops
bitsey jumps out vhs cassette in hand
she doesnt close the door
bitsey runs down the middle of the two lane highway
the rental car in the b
recedes into the mist visibility is no more than fifty yards
the sounds of her breathing and shoes hitting the pavement echo into the mist
she runs and runs
a car comes up quickly behind her
its horn blares
she turns starts to wave it down
the driver sits on his horn swerves around her onto highways shoulder and drives on
runs past an abandoned vegetable stand
runs past a sleepy farmhouse
she runs and runs
she slows out of strength looks up and down the highway
both in front and behind it leads straight into the mist a tunnel of fog
she stumbles on a final effort
coming toward her in the distance are small flashing lights
they rise on hill and then fall behind another
they appear again
soon she can make out the form of an ambulance and its highway patrol escort
the vehicles move slowly toward her without sirens as deathly quiet as their cargo
she stands to the side of the road as they approach
the highway patrol vehicle and the ambulance marked texas department of corrections pass silently in slow motion
she watches as they disappear back into the mist
in slow motion she screams falls to her knees wailing but we cannot hear her
we hear nothing
in the b
dusty walks out the front door carrying two large suitcases
on his desk in the f
is a radiator cap
belyeu makes his way through the departure hall carrying the aluminum suitcase
roberts and the court tv breaking news logo are on the screen
to camera heres what we know so far
last night news magazine posted on their web site a video obtained by reporter bitsey bloom
the tv is mounted on the wall in bitsey watches the report with about a dozen colleagues
kruger stands beside her
a few people congratulate her
she attempts a smile and nods though she doesnt look away from the tv
kruger shushes the others to hear the story
the footage appears to show constance harraway commit suicide
bloom reports she received the tape friday morning at a motel in huntsville where she was staying while conducting gales last interview
zack watches bitsey from the other side of the room
she looks over at him then quickly looks back at the tv
the tape apparently had been in the possession of a former deathwatch director
camera pulls back to reveal that roberts is standing in front of wrights cabin
other journalists and gawkers can be seen out front
police vehicles are also visible
suits and officers move in and out of the cabin
reading the name off a card dustin emil wright
as you can see police and officials from the state attorneys office have been in and out of his cabin all morning looking for clues to his whereabouts
belyeu enters a mens room
belyeu walks to a row of sinks
he sets the case on the floor and starts to wash his hands
a businessman combs his hair to belyeus left
belyeu looks in the mirror and sees dusty approach from a stall
the room watches roberts
a fanatic in the movement to stop the death penalty
it appears wright withheld the tape to make an obscure political point about the potential for error in capital cases
she watches trying to contain her emotions
zack watches her
she looks his direction
he smiles sadly looks away
dusty washes his hands looks down at the case
the businessman leaves
passport and ticket as well
governor hardin is on the steps of the capital journalists around her
well its a tragedy for all of us
as to whether this will change policy the people of texas will have to decide
right now the prudent course is to put things on hold pendin a procedural review allow ourselves time to mourn
kruger leans toward bitsey
you bet shell review
capital punishment approval rates dropped points
bitsey just looks at the tv trying to make it through
dusty picks up the case
belyeu straightens his tie
what are you going to do
walking past him go to the opera
old footage of david being led in chains from an austin jailhouse to a waiting van
he wears the clothes he was wearing the day constance died
of course the ultimate irony is that david gale a man who became an unwitting martyr may achieve in death what he worked for in life
she bites her lower lip in a manner reminiscent of constance
dusty walks along the ramblan
he carries a duty free bag and the aluminum suitcase
he comes to a building checks its number against a piece of paper enters
dusty ascends a staircase onto hallway
he walks a few steps to door number six
an old spanish woman passes him
senorita gale esta viviendo aqui
the old woman moves down the stairs
dusty puts the aluminum suitcase on the doormat
from the duty free bag he takes out davids yale sweatshirt lays it over the case
he rings the doorbell turns and walks back down the hall
he stands at the top of the stairs waiting for someone to answer before descending
sharon older than weve seen her opens the door sees the case and sweatshirt
she looks around but dusty is gone
she picks them up
bitsey sits at her neurotically neat desk looking out the window
its a sunny day in new york
for the first time we see her wearing something besides a business suit
framed on her cubicle wall is the latest news cover page a picture of david with the headline the executed innocent
a mail guy drops a fed ex package on her desk
this just came
its from belyeu crane congress ave
she opens it pulls out cloud dog and a handwritten note on belyeu crane stationery
reads david wanted you to have this
he said it would be the key to your freedom
regards benjamin belyeu
at the breakfast table a spanish yuppie male sits with a newspaper in front of him
he watches sharon open the case
inside money stacks and stacks of money
on top is an unsigned note im sorrier than you can know
bitsey holds the stuffed sheep
looks at the note key to your freedom
key to your
suddenly she understands
she squeezes the sheep shakes it hears something
she cuts the sheep open with scissors
a hi tape is in the stuffing
its hand labeled off the record
she jumps up
bitsey hurries through the cubicles
she goes down a hall and into the multimedia room
bitsey locks the door puts the tape into a hi deck
the tape is cued to where dusty picks up constances robe and walks past the tripod out of frame
we see only constances body
we hear the sliding door to the patio open behind the camera
calling its over
a long beat
footsteps on the patio
want me to turn this off
david walks into frame
he goes a couple of steps toward constances body and stops facing her
we see him only from behind
he looks at her runs his hands over his head
i couldnt watch
she preferred it that way
you were right about not tellin her the whole plan
it helped her to think her death would save me
you sure you want to do this
almost martyrs dont count
better go ahead then
david goes to constance kneels
he reaches down and with his thumb gently strokes her face through the plastic
he stands turns and walks back to the camera
he reaches behind the lens to turn it off
half his face fills frame his watery eyes looking directly at us
in the other half we see constances body
dusty sits watching a performance of puccinis turandot
on stage is the scene where liu martyrs herself
he closes his eyes
