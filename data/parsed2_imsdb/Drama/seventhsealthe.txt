the seventh seal the night had brought little relief from the heat and at dawn a hot gust of wind blows across the colorless sea
the knight antonius block lies prostrate on some spruce branches spread over the fine sand
his eyes are wide open and bloodshot from lack of sleep
nearby his squire jons is snoring loudly
he has fallen asleep where he collapsed at the edge of the forest among the wind gnarled fir trees
his open mouth gapes towards the dawn and unearthly sounds come from his throat
at the sudden gust of wind the horses stir stretching their parched muzzles towards the sea
they are as thin and worn as their masters
the knight has risen and waded into the shallow water where he rinses his sunburned face and blistered lips
jons rolls over to face the forest and the darkness
he moans in his sleep and vigorously scratches the stubbled hair on his head
a scar stretches diagonally across his scalp as white as lightning against the grime
the knight returns to the beach and falls on his knees
with his eyes closed and brow furrowed he says his morning prayers
his hands are clenched together and his lips form the words silently
his face is sad and bitter
he opens his eyes and stares directly into the morning sun which wallows up from the misty sea like some bloated dying fish
the sky is gray and immobile a dome of lead
a cloud hangs mute and dark over the western horizon
high up barely visible a seagull floats on motionless wings
its cry is weird and restless
the knights large gray horse lifts its head and whinnies
antonius block turns around
behind him stands a man in black
his face is very pale and he keeps his hands hidden in the wide folds of his cloak
who are you
i am death
have you come for me
i have been walking by your side for a long time
that i know
are you prepared
my body is frightened but i am not
well there is no shame in that
the knight has risen to his feet
death opens his cloak to place it around the knights shoulders
wait a moment
thats what they all say
i grant no reprieves
you play chess dont you
a gleam of interest kindles in deaths eyes
how did you know that
i have seen it in paintings and heard it sung in ballads
yes in fact im quite a good chess player
but you cant be better than i am
the knight rummages in the big black bag which he keeps beside him and takes out a small chessboard
he places it carefully on the ground and begins setting up the pieces
why do you want to play chess with me
i have my reasons
that is your privilege
the condition is that i may live as long as i hold out against you
if i win you will release me
is it agreed
the knight holds out his two fists to death who smiles at him suddenly
death points to one of the knights hands it contains a black pawn
you drew black
dont you think so
the knight and death bend over the chessboard
after a moment of hesitation antonius block opens with his kings pawn
death moves also using his kings pawn
the morning breeze has died down
the restless movement of the sea has ceased the water is silent
the sun rises from the haze and its glow whitens
the sea gull floats under the dark cloud frozen in space
the day is already scorchingly hot
the squire jons is awakened by a kick in the rear
opening his eyes he grunts like a pig and yawns broadly
he scrambles to his feet saddles his horse and picks up the heavy pack
the knight slowly rides away from the sea into the forest near the beach and up towards the road
he pretends not to hear the morning prayers of his squire
jons soon overtakes him
sings between a strumpets legs to lie is the life for which i sigh
he stops and looks at his master but the knight hasnt heard jons song or he pretends that he hasnt
to give further vent to his irritation jons sings even louder
sings up above is god almighty so very far away but your brother the devil you will meet on every level
jons finally gets the knights attention
he stops singing
the knight his horse jonss own horse and jons himself know all the songs by heart
the long dusty journey from the holy land hasnt made them any cleaner
they ride across a mossy heath which stretches towards the horizon
beyond it the sea lies shimmering in the white glitter of the sun
in frjestad everyone was talking about evil omens and other horrible things
two horses had eaten each other in the night and in the churchyard graves had been opened and the remains of corpses scattered all over the place
yesterday afternoon there were as many as four suns in the heavens
the knight doesnt answer
close by a scrawny dog is whining crawling towards its master who is sleeping in a sitting position in the blazing hot sun
a black cloud of flies clusters around his head and shoulders
the miserable looking dog whines incessantly as it lies flat on its stomach wagging its tail
jons dismounts and approaches the sleeping man
jons addresses him politely
when he doesnt receive an answer he walks up to the man in order to shake him awake
he bends over the sleeping mans shoulder but quickly pulls back his hand
the man falls backward on the heath his face turned towards jons
it is a corpse staring at jons with empty eye sockets and white teeth
jons remounts and overtakes his master
he takes a drink from his waterskin and hands the bag to the knight
well did he show you the way
what did he say
was he a mute
no sir i wouldnt say that
as a matter of fact he was quite eloquent
he was eloquent all right
the trouble is that what he had to say was most depressing
sings one moment youre bright and lively the next youre crawling with worms
fate is a terrible villain and you my friend its poor victim
must you sing
the knight hands his squire a piece of bread which keeps him quiet for a while
the sun burns down on them cruelly and beads of perspiration trickle down their faces
there is a cloud of dust around the horses hooves
they ride past an inlet and along verdant groves
in the shade of some large trees stands a bulging wagon covered with a mottled canvas
a horse whinnies nearby and is answered by the knights horse
the two travelers do not stop to rest under the shade of the trees but continue riding until they disappear at the bend of the road
in his sleep jof the juggler hears the neighing of his horse and the answer from a distance
he tries to go on sleeping but it is stifling inside the wagon
the rays of the sun filtering through the canvas cast streaks of light across the face of jofs wife mia and their one year old son mikael who are sleeping
deeply and peacefully
near them jonas skat an older man snores loudly
jof crawls out of the wagon
there is still a spot of shade under the big trees
he takes a drink of water gargles stretches and talks to his scrawny old horse
have you had breakfast
i cant eat grass worse luck
cant you teach me how
were a little hard up
people arent very interested in juggling in this part of the country
he has picked up the juggling balls and slowly begins to toss them
then he stands on his head and cackles like a hen
suddenly he stops and sits down with a look of utter astonishment on his face
the wind causes the trees to sway slightly
the leaves stir and there is a soft murmur
the flowers and the grass bend gracefully and somewhere a bird raises its voice in a long warble
jofs face breaks into a smile and his eyes fill with tears
with a dazed expression he sits flat on his behind while the grass rustles softly and bees and butterflies hum around his head
the unseen bird continues to sing
suddenly the breeze stops blowing the bird stops singing jofs smile fades the flowers and grass wilt in the heat
the old horse is still walking around grazing and swishing its tail to ward off the flies
jof comes to life
he rushes into the wagon and shakes mia awake
mia wake up
mia ive just seen something
ive got to tell you about it
sits up terrified what is it
listen ive had a vision
no it wasnt a vision
it was real absolutely real
oh so youve had a vision again
mias voice is filled with gentle irony
jof shakes his head and grabs her by the shoulders
but i did see her
whom did you see
the virgin mary
mia cant help being impressed by her husbands fervor
she lowers her voice
did you really see her
she was so close to me that i could have touched her
she had a golden crown on her head and wore a blue gown with flowers of gold
she was barefoot and had small brown hands with which she was holding the child and teaching him to walk
and then she saw me watching her and she smiled at me
my eyes filled with tears and when i wiped them away she had disappeared
and everything became so still in the sky and on the earth
can you understand
what an imagination you have
you dont believe me
but it was real i tell you not the kind of reality you see every day but a different kind
perhaps it was the kind of reality you told us about when you saw the devil painting our wagon wheels red using his tail as a brush
embarrassed why must you keep bringing that up
and then you discovered that you had red paint under your nails
well perhaps that time i made it up
eagerly i did it just so that you would believe in my other visions
the real ones
the ones that i didnt make up
severely you have to keep your visions under control
otherwise people will think that youre a half wit which youre not
at least not yet as far as i know
but come to think of it im not so sure about that
angry i didnt ask to have visions
i cant help it if voices speak to me if the holy virgin appears before me and angels and devils like my company
sits up havent i told you once and for all that i need my mornings sleep
i have asked you politely pleaded with you but nothing works
so now im telling you to shut up
his eyes are popping with rage
he turns over and continues snoring where he left off
mia and jof decide that it would be wisest to leave the wagon
they sit down on a crate
mia has mikael on her knees
he is naked and squirms vigorously
jof sits close to his wife
slumped over he still looks dazed and astonished
a dry hot wind blows from the sea
if we would only get some rain
everything is burned to cinders
we wont have anything to eat this winter
yawning well get by
he says this smilingly with a casual air
he stretches and laughs contentedly
i want mikael to have a better life than ours
mikael will grow up to be a great acrobat or a juggler who can do the one impossible trick
to make one of the balls stand absolutely still in the air
but thats impossible
impossible for us but not for him
youre dreaming again
the sun has made her a bit drowsy and she lies down on the grass
jof does likewise and puts one arm around his wifes shoulders
ive composed a song
i made it up during the night when i couldnt sleep
do you want to hear it
im very curious
i have to sit up first
he sits with his legs crossed makes a dramatic gesture with his arms and sings in a loud voice
sings on a lily branch a dove is perched against the summer sky she sings a wondrous song of christ and theres great joy on high
he interrupts his singing in order to be complimented by his wife
are you asleep
its a lovely song
i havent finished yet
i heard it but i think ill sleep a little longer
you can sing the rest to me afterwards
all you do is sleep
jof is a bit offended and glances over at his son mikael but he is also sleeping soundly in the high grass
jonas skat comes out from the wagon
he yawns he is very tired and in a bad humor
in his hands he holds a crudely made death mask
is this supposed to be a mask for an actor
if the priests didnt pay us so well id say no thank you
are you going to play death
just think scaring decent folk out of their wits with this kind of nonsense
when are we supposed to do this play
at the saints feast in elsinore
were going to perform right on the church steps believe it or not
wouldnt it be better to play something bawdy
people like it better and besides its more fun
theres a rumor going around that theres a terrible pestilence in the land and now the priests are prophesying sudden death and all sorts of spiritual agonies
mia is awake now and lies contentedly on her back sucking on a blade of grass and looking smilingly at her husband
and what part am i to play
youre such a damn fool so youre going to be the soul of man
thats a bad part of course
who makes the decisions around here
who is the director of this company anyhow
skat grinning holds the mask in front of his face and recites dramatically
bear this in mind you fool
your life hangs by a thread
your time is short
in his usual voice are the women going to like me in this getup
will i make a hit
i feel as if i were dead already
he stumbles into the wagon muttering furiously
jof sits leaning forward
mia lies beside him on the grass
what is it
what do you mean
dont say anything
im as silent as a grave
i love you
waves of heat envelop the gray stone church in a strange white mist
the knight dismounts and enters
after tying up the horses jons slowly follows him in
when he comes onto the church porch he stops in surprise
to the right of the entrance there is a large fresco on the wall not quite finished
perched on a crude scaffolding is a painter wearing a red cap and paint stained clothes
he has one brush in his mouth while with another in his hand he outlines a small terrified human face amidst a sea of other faces
what is this supposed to represent
the dance of death
and that one is death
yes he dances off with all of them
why do you paint such nonsense
i thought it would serve to remind people that they must die
well its not going to make them feel any happier
why should one always make people happy
it might not be a bad idea to scare them a little once in a while
then theyll close their eyes and refuse to look at your painting
oh theyll look
a skull is almost more interesting than a naked woman
if you do scare them
and if they think
theyll become still more scared
and then theyll run right into the arms of the priests
thats not my business
youre only painting your dance of death
im only painting things as they are
everyone else can do as he likes
just think how some people will curse you
but then ill paint something amusing for them to look at
i have to make a living at least until the plague takes me
that sounds horrible
you should see the boils on a diseased mans throat
you should see how his body shrivels up so that his legs look like knotted strings like the man ive painted over there
the painter points with his brush
jons sees a small human form writhing in the grass its eyes turned upwards in a frenzied look of horror and pain
that looks terrible
it certainly does
he tries to rip out the boil he bites his hands tears his veins open with his fingernails and his screams can be heard everywhere
does that scare you
you dont know me
what are the horrors youve painted over there
the remarkable thing is that the poor creatures think the pestilence is the lords punishment
mobs of people who call themselves slaves of sin are swarming over the country flagellating themselves and others all for the glory of god
do they really whip themselves
yes its a terrible sight
i crawl into a ditch and hide when they pass by
do you have any brandy
ive been drinking water all day and its made me as thirsty as a camel in the desert
i think i frightened you after all
jons sits down with the painter who produces a jug of brandy
the knight is kneeling before a small altar
it is dark and quiet around him
the air is cool and musty
pictures of saints look down on him with stony eyes
christs face is turned upwards his mouth open as if in a cry of anguish
on the ceiling beam there is a representation of a hideous devil spying on a miserable human being
the knight hears a sound from the confession booth and approaches it
the face of death appears behind the grille for an instant but the knight doesnt see him
i want to talk to you as openly as i can but my heart is empty
death doesnt answer
the emptiness is a mirror turned towards my own face
i see myself in it and i am filled with fear and disgust
death doesnt answer
through my indifference to my fellow men i have isolated myself from their company
now i live in a world of phantoms
i am imprisoned in my dreams and fantasies
and yet you dont want to die
yes i do
what are you waiting for
i want knowledge
you want guarantees
call it whatever you like
is it so cruelly inconceivable to grasp god with the senses
why should he hide himself in a mist of half spoken promises and unseen miracles
death doesnt answer
how can we have faith in those who believe when we cant have faith in ourselves
what is going to happen to those of us who want to believe but arent able to
and what is to become of those who neither want to nor are capable of believing
the knight stops and waits for a reply but no one speaks or answers him
there is complete silence
why cant i kill god within me
why does he live on in this painful and humiliating way even though i curse him and want to tear him out of my heart
why in spite of everything is he a baffling reality that i cant shake off
do you hear me
yes i hear you
i want knowledge not faith not suppositions but knowledge
i want god to stretch out his hand towards me reveal himself and speak to me
but he remains silent
i call out to him in the dark but no one seems to be there
perhaps no one is there
then life is an outrageous horror
no one can live in the face of death knowing that all is nothingness
most people never reflect about either death or the futility of life
but one day they will have to stand at that last moment of life and look towards the darkness
when that day comes
in our fear we make an image and that image we call god
you are worrying
death visited me this morning
we are playing chess together
this reprieve gives me the chance to arrange an urgent matter
what matter is that
my life has been a futile pursuit a wandering a great deal of talk without meaning
i feel no bitterness or self reproach because the lives of most people are very much like this
but i will use my reprieve for one meaningful deed
is that why you are playing chess with death
he is a clever opponent but up to now i havent lost a single man
how will you outwit death in your game
i use a combination of the bishop and the knight which he hasnt yet discovered
in the next move ill shatter one of his flanks
ill remember that
death shows his face at the grill of the confession booth for a moment but disappears instantly
youve tricked and cheated me
but well meet again and ill find a way
invisible well meet at the inn and there well continue playing
the knight raises his hand and looks at it in the sunlight which comes through the tiny window
this is my hand
i can move it feel the blood pulsing through it
the sun is still high in the sky and i antonius block am playing chess with death
he makes a fist of his hand and lifts it to his temple
meanwhile jons and the painter have got drunk and are talking animatedly together
me and my master have been abroad and have just come home
do you understand you little pictor
for ten years we sat in the holy land and let snakes bite us flies sting us wild animals eat us heathens butcher us the wine poison us the women
give us lice the lice devour us the fevers rot us all for the glory of god
our crusade was such madness that only a real idealist could have thought it up
but what you said about the plague was horrible
its worse than that
no matter which way you turn you have your rump behind you
thats the truth
the rump behind you the rump behind you theres a profound truth
jons paints a small figure which is supposed to represent himself
this is squire jns
he grins at death mocks the lord laughs at himself and leers at the girls
his world is a jnsworld believable only to himself ridiculous to all including himself meaningless to heaven and of no interest to hell
the knight walks by calls to his squire and goes out into the bright sunshine
jons manages to set himself down from the scaffolding
outside the church four soldiers and a monk are in the process of putting a woman in the stocks
her face is pale and child like her head has been shaved and her knuckles are bloody and broken
her eyes are wide open yet she doesnt appear to be fully conscious
jons and the knight stop and watch in silence
the soldiers are working quickly and skillfully but they seem frightened and dejected
the monk mumbles from a small book
one of the soldiers picks up a wooden bucket and with his hand begins to smear a bloody paste on the wall of the church and around the woman
jons holds his nose
that soup of yours has a hell of a stink
what is it good for
she has had carnal intercourse with the evil one
he whispers this with a horrified face and continues to splash the sticky mess on the wall
and now shes in the stocks
she will be burned tomorrow morning at the parish boundary
but we have to keep the devil away from the rest of us
holding his nose and you do that with this stinking mess
its the best remedy blood mixed with the bile of a big black dog
the devil cant stand the smell
neither can i
jons walks over towards the horses
the knight stands for a few moments looking at the young girl
she is almost a child
slowly she turns her eyes towards him
have you seen the devil
the monk stops reading and raises his head
you must not talk to her
can that be so dangerous
i dont know but she is believed to have caused the pestilence with which we are affected
he nods resignedly and walks away
the young woman starts to moan as though she were having a horrible nightmare
the sound of her cries follows the two riders for a considerable distance down the road
the sun stands high in the sky like a red ball of fire
the waterskin is empty and jons looks for a well where he can fill it
they approach a group of peasant cottages at the edge of the forest
jons ties up the horses slings the skin over his shoulder and walks along the path towards the nearest cottage
as always his movements are light and almost soundless
the door to the cottage is open
he stops outside but when no one appears he enters
it is very dark inside and his foot touches a soft object
he looks down
beside the whitewashed fireplace a woman is lying with her face to the ground
at the sound of approaching steps jons quickly hides behind the door
a man comes down a ladder from the loft
he is broad and thick set
his eyes are black and his face is pale and puffy
his clothes are well cut but dirty and in rags
he carries a cloth sack
looking around he goes into the inner room bends over the bed tucks something into the bag slinks along the walls looking on the shelves finds something else which he
tucks in his bag
slowly he re enters the outer room bends over the dead woman and carefully slips a ring from her finger
at that moment a young woman comes through the door
she stops and stares at the stranger
why do you look so surprised
i steal from the dead
these days its quite a lucrative enterprise
the girl makes a movement as if to run away
youre thinking of running to the village and telling
that wouldnt serve any purpose
each of us has to save his own skin
its as simple as that
dont touch me
dont try to scream
theres no one around to hear you neither god nor man
slowly he closes the door behind the girl
the stuffy room is now in almost total darkness
but jons becomes clearly visible
i recognize you although its a long time since we met
your name is raval from the theological college at roskilde
you are dr
mirabilis coelestis et diabilis
raval smiles uneasily and looks around
am i not right
the girl stands immobile
you were the one who ten years ago convinced my master of the necessity to join a better class crusade to the holy land
raval looks around
you look uncomfortable
do you have a stomach ache
raval smiles anxiously
when i see you i suddenly understand the meaning of these ten years which previously seemed to me such a waste
our life was too good and we were too satisfied with ourselves
the lord wanted to punish us for our complacency
that is why he sent you to spew out your holy venom and poison the knight
i acted in good faith
but now you know better dont you
because now you have turned into a thief
a more fitting and rewarding occupation for scoundrels
isnt that so
with a quick movement he knocks the knife out of ravals hand gives him a kick so that he falls on the floor and is about to finish him off
suddenly the girl screams
jons stops and makes a gesture of generosity with his hand
by all means
im not bloodthirsty
he bends over raval
dont beat me
i dont have the heart to touch you doctor
but remember this the next time we meet ill brand your face the way one does with thieves
he rises what i really came for is to get my waterskin filled
we have a deep well with cool fresh water
come ill show you
they walk out of the house
raval lies still for a few moments then he rises slowly and looks around
when no one is in sight he takes his bag and steals away
jons quenches his thirst and fills his bag with water
the girl helps him
jns is my name
i am a pleasant and talkative young man who has never had anything but kind thoughts and has only done beautiful and noble deeds
im kindest of all to young women
with them there is no limit to my kindness
he embraces her and tries to kiss her but she holds herself back
almost immediately he loses interest hoists the waterbag on his shoulder and pats the girl on the cheek
goodbye my girl
i could very well have raped you but between you and me im tired of that kind of love
it runs a little dry in the end
he laughs kindly and walks away from her
when he has walked a short distance he turns the girl is still there
now that i think of it i will need a housekeeper
can you prepare good food
the girl nods as far as i know im still a married man but i have high hopes that my wife is dead by now
thats why i need a housekeeper
the girl doesnt answer but gets up the devil with it
come along and dont stand there staring
ive saved your life so you owe me a great deal
she begins walking towards him her head bent
he doesnt wait for her but walks towards the knight who patiently awaits his squire
the embarrassment inn lies in the eastern section of the province
the plague has not yet reached this area on its way along the coast
the actors have placed their wagon under a tree in the yard of the inn
dressed in colorful costumes they perform a farce
the spectators watch the performance commenting on it noisily
there are merchants with fat beer sweaty faces apprentices and journeymen farmhands and milkmaids
a whole flock of children perch in the trees around the wagon
the knight and his squire have sat down in the shadow of a wall
they drink beer and doze in the midday heat
the girl from the deserted village sleeps at jonss side
skat beats the drums jof blows the flute mia performs a gay and lively dance
they perspire under the hot white sun
when they have finished skat comes forward and bows
noble ladies and gentlemen i thank you for your interest
please remain standing for a little longer or sit on the ground because we are now going to perform a tragedia about an unfaithful wife her jealous husband and the
handsome lover thats me
mia and jof have quickly changed costumes and again step out on the stage
they bow to the public
here is the husband
here is the wife
if youll shut up over there youll see something splendid
as i said i play the lover and i havent entered yet
thats why im going to hide behind the curtain for the time being
he wipes the sweat from his forehead its damned hot
i think well have a thunderstorm
he places his leg in front of jof as if to trip him raises mias skirt makes a face as if he could see all the wonders of the world
underneath it and disappears behind the gaudily patched curtains
skat is very handsome now that he can see himself in the reflection of a tin washbowl
his hair is tightly curled his eyebrows are beautifully bushy glittering earrings vie for equal attention with his teeth and his cheeks are flushed rose red
he sits out in back on the tailboard of the wagon dangling his legs and whistling to himself
in the meantime jof and mia play their tragedy it is not however received with great acclaim
skat suddenly discovers that someone is watching him as he gazes contentedly into the tin bowl
a woman stands there stately in both height and volume
skat frowns toys with his small dagger and occasionally throws a roguish but fiery glance at the beautiful visitor
she suddenly discovers that one of her shoes doesnt quite fit
she leans down to fix it and in doing so allows her generous bosom to burst out of its prison no more than honor and chastity allow but still enough
so that the actor with his experienced eye immediately sees that there are ample rewards to be had here
now she comes a little closer kneels down and opens a bundle containing several dainty morsels and a skin filled with red wine
jonas skat manages not to fall off the wagon in his excitement
standing on the steps of the wagon he supports himself against a nearby tree crosses his legs and bows
the woman quietly bites into a chicken leg dripping with fat
at this moment the actor is stricken by a radiant glance full of lustful appetites
when he sees this look skat makes an instantaneous decision jumps down from the wagon and kneels in front of the blushing damsel
she becomes weak and faint from his nearness looks at him with a glassy glance and breathes heavily
skat doesnt neglect to press kisses on her small chubby hands
the sun shines brightly and small birds make noises in the bushes
now she is forced to sit back her legs seem unwilling to support her any longer
bewildered she singles out another chicken leg from the large sack of food and holds it up in front of skat with an appealing and triumphant expression as if it
were her maidenhood being offered as a prize
skat hesitates momentarily but he is still the strategist
he lets the chicken leg fall to the grass and murmurs in the womans rosy ear
his words seem to please her
she puts her arms around the actors neck and pulls him to her with such fierceness that both of them lose their balance and tumble down on the soft grass
the small birds take to their wings with frightened shrieks
jof stands in the hot sun with a flickering lantern in his hand
mia pretends to be asleep on a bench which has been pulled forward on the stage
night and moonlight now prevail here sleeps my wife so frail
does she snore
may i point out that this is a tragedy and in tragedies one doesnt snore
i think she should snore anyhow
this opinion causes mirth in the audience
jof becomes slightly confused and goes out of character but mia keeps her head and begins snoring
night and moonlight now prevail
there snores i mean sleeps my wife so frail
jealous i am as never before i hide myself behind this door
faithful is she to her lover not me
he soon comes a stealing to awaken her lusty feeling
i shall now kill him dead for cuckolding me in my bed
there he comes in the moonlight his white legs shining bright
quiet as a mouse here ill lie tell him not that hes about to die
jof hides himself
mia immediately ends her snoring and sits up looking to the left
look there he comes in the night my lover my hearts delight
she becomes silent and looks wide eyed in front of her
the mood in the yard in front of the inn has up to now been rather lighthearted despite the heat
now a rapid change occurs
people who had been laughing and chattering fall silent
their faces seem to pale under their sunbrowned skins the children stop their games and stand with gaping mouths and frightened eyes
jof steps out in front of the curtain
his painted face bears an expression of horror
mia has risen with mikael in her arms
some of the women in the yard have fallen on their knees others hide their faces many begin to mutter half forgotten prayers
all have turned their faces towards the white road
now a shrill song is heard
it is frenzied almost a scream
a crucified christ sways above the hilltop
the cross bearers soon come into sight
they are dominican monks their hoods pulled down over their faces
more and more of them follow carrying litters with heavy coffins or clutching holy relics their hands stretched out spasmodically
the dust wells up around their black hoods the censers sway and emit a thick ashen smoke which smells of rancid herbs
after the line of monks comes another procession
it is a column of men boys old men women girls children
all of them have steel edged scourges in their hands with which they whip themselves and each other howling ecstatically
they twist in pain their eyes bulge wildly their lips are gnawed to shreds and dripping with foam
they have been seized by madness
they bite their own hands and arms whip each other in violent almost rhythmic outbursts
throughout it all the shrill song howls from their bursting throats
many sway and fall lift themselves up again support each other and help each other to intensify the scourging
now the procession pauses at the crossroads in front of the inn
the monks fall on their knees hiding their faces with clenched hands arms pressed tightly together
their song never stops
the christ figure on its timbered cross is raised above the heads of the crowd
it is not christ triumphant but the suffering jesus with the sores the blood the hammered nails and the face in convulsive pain
the son of god nailed on the wood of the cross suffering scorn and shame
the penitents have now sunk down in the dirt of the road
they collapse where they stood like slaughtered cattle
their screams rise with the song of the monks through misty clouds of incense towards the white fire of the sun
a large square monk rises from his knees and reveals his face which is red brown from the sun
his eyes glitter his voice is thick with impotent scorn
god has sentenced us to punishment
we shall all perish in the black death
you standing there like gaping cattle you who sit there in your glutted complacency do you know that this may be your last hour
death stands right behind you
i can see how his crown gleams in the sun
his scythe flashes as he raises it above your heads
which one of you shall he strike first
you there who stand staring like a goat will your mouth be twisted into the last unfinished gasp before nightfall
and you woman who bloom with life and self satisfaction will you pale and become extinguished before the morning dawns
you back there with your swollen nose and stupid grin do you have another year left to dirty the earth with your refuse
do you know you insensible fools that you shall die today or tomorrow or the next day because all of you have been sentenced
do you hear what i say
do you hear the word
you have been sentenced sentenced
the monk falls silent looking around with a bitter face and a cold scornful glance
now he clenches his hands straddles the ground and turns his face upwards
lord have mercy on us in our humiliation
dont turn your face from us in loathing and contempt but be merciful to us for the sake of your son jesus christ
he makes the sign of the cross over the crowd and then begins a new song in a strong voice
the monks rise and join in the song
as if driven by some superhuman force the penitents begin to whip themselves again still wailing and moaning
the procession continues
new members have joined the rear of the column others who were unable to go on lie weeping in the dust of the road
jons the squire drinks his beer
this damned ranting about doom
is that food for the minds of modern people
do they really expect us to take them seriously
the knight grins tiredly
yes now you grin at me my lord
but allow me to point out that ive either read heard or experienced most of the tales which we people tell each other
yawns yes yes
even the ghost stories about god the father the angels jesus christ and the holy ghost all these ive accepted without too much emotion
he leans down over the girl as she crouches at his feet and pats her on the head
the knight drinks his beer silently
contentedly my little stomach is my world my head is my eternity and my hands two wonderful suns
my legs are times damned pendulums and my dirty feet are two splendid starting points for my philosophy
everything is worth precisely as much as a belch the only difference being that a belch is more satisfying
the beer mug is empty
sighing jons gets to his feet
the girl follows him like a shadow
in the yard he meets a large man with a sooty face and a dark expression
he stops jons with a roar
what are you screaming about
i am plog the smith and you are the squire jns
have you seen my wife
no i havent
but if i had seen her and she looked like you id quickly forget that id seen her
well in that case you havent seen her
maybe shes run off
do you know anything
i know quite a lot but not about your wife
go to the inn
maybe they can help you
the smith sighs sadly and goes inside
the inn is very small and full of people eating and drinking to forget their newly aroused fears of eternity
in the open fireplace a roasting pig turns on an iron spit
the sun shines outside the casement window its sharp rays piercing the darkness of the room which is thick with fumes and perspiration
yes its true
the plague is spreading along the west coast
people are dying like flies
usually business would be good at this time of year but damn it ive still got my whole stock unsold
they speak of the judgment day
and all these omens are terrible
worms chopped off hands and other monstrosities began pouring out of an old woman and down in the village another woman gave birth to a calfs head
the day of judgment
it hasnt rained here for a month
well surely lose our crops
and people are acting crazy id say
they flee the country and carry the plague with them wherever they go
the day of judgment
just think just think
if its as they say i suppose a person should look after his house and try to enjoy life as long as he can
but there have been other things too such things that cant even be spoken of
whispers things that mustnt be named but the priests say that the woman carries it between her legs and thats why she must cleanse herself
and the riders of the apocalypse stand at the bend in the village road
i imagine theyll come on judgment night at sundown
there are many who have purged themselves with fire and died from it but the priests say that its better to die pure than to live for hell
this is the end yes it is
no one says it out loud but all of us know that its the end
and people are going mad from fear
so youre afraid too
of course im afraid
the judgment day becomes night and the angels descend and the graves open
it will be terrible to see
they whisper in low tones and sit close to each other
plog the smith shoves his way into a place next to jof who is still dressed in his costume
opposite him sits raval leaning slightly forward his face perspiring heavily
raval rolls an armlet out on the table
do you want this armlet
you can have it cheap
i cant afford it
its real silver
but its surely too expensive for me
excuse me but has anyone here seen my wife
has she disappeared
they say shes run away
has she deserted you
with an actor
if shes got such bad taste then i think you should let her go
my first thought of course was to kill her
but to murder her thats a terrible thing to do
im also going to kill the actor
of course the one she eloped with
what has he done to deserve that
are you stupid
now i understand
there are too many of them so even if he hasnt done anything in particular you ought to kill him merely because hes an actor
you see my wife has always been interested in the tricks of the theatre
and that turned out to be her misfortune
her misfortune but not mine because a person whos born unfortunate can hardly suffer from any further misfortune
isnt that true
now raval enters the discussion
he is slightly drunk and his voice is shrill and evil
you sit there and lie to the smith
youre an actor too and its probably your partner whos run off with plogs old lady
are you an actor too
i wouldnt quite call myself that
we ought to kill you its only logical
laughs youre really funny
how strange youve turned pale
have you anything on your conscience
dont you think hes funny
to plog oh you dont
maybe we should mark you up a little with a knife like they do petty scoundrels of your kind
plog bangs his hands down on the table so that the dishes jump
he gets up
shouting what have you done with my wife
the room becomes silent
jof looks around but there is no exit no way to escape
he puts his hands on the table
suddenly a knife flashes through the air and sinks into the table top between his fingers
jof snatches away his hands and raises his head
he looks half surprised as if the truth had just become apparent to him
do you want to hurt me
have i provoked someone or got in the way
ill leave right now and never come back
jof looks from one face to another but no one seems ready to help him or come to his defense
get up so everyone can hear you
trembling jof rises
he opens his mouth as if to say something but not a word comes out
stand on your head so that we can see how good an actor you are
jof gets up on the table and stands on his head
a hand pushes him forward so that he collapses on the floor
plog rises pulls him to his feet with one hand
shouts what have you done with my wife
plog beats him so furiously that jof flies across the table
raval leans over him
dont lie there moaning
get up and dance
i dont want to
show us how you imitate a bear
i cant play a bear
lets see if you cant after all
raval prods jof lightly with the knife point
jof gets up with cold sweat on his cheeks and forehead frightened half to death
he begins to jump and hop on top of the tables swinging his arms and legs and making grotesque faces
some laugh but most of the people sit silently
jof gasps as if his lungs were about to burst
he sinks to his knees and someone pours beer over him
be a good bear
i havent done any harm
i havent got the strength to play a bear any more
at that moment the door opens and jons enters
jof sees his chance and steals out
raval intends to follow him but suddenly stops
jons and raval look at each other
do you remember what i was going to do to you if we met again
raval steps back without speaking
im a man who keeps his word
jons raises his knife and cuts raval from forehead to cheek
raval staggers towards the wall
the hot day has become night
singing and howling can be heard from the inn
in a hollow near the forest the light still lingers
hidden in the grass and the shrubbery nightingales sing and their voices echo through the stillness
the players wagon stands in a small ravine and not far away the horse grazes on the dry grass
mia has sat down in front of the wagon with her son in her arms
they play together and laugh happily
now a soft gleam of light strokes the hilltops a last reflection from the red clouds over the sea
not far from the wagon the knight sits crouched over his chess game
he lifts his head
the evening light moves across the heavy wagon wheels across the woman and the child
the knight gets up
mia sees him and smiles
she holds up her struggling son as if to amuse the whats his name
how old is he
oh hell soon be two
hes big for his age
do you think so
yes i guess hes rather big
she puts the child down on the ground and half rises to shake out her red skirt
when she sits down again the knight steps closer
you played some kind of show this afternoon
did you think it was bad
you are more beautiful now without your face painted and this gown is more becoming
you see jonas skat has run off and left us so were in real trouble now
is that your husband
the other man is my husband
his name is jof
oh that one
and now theres only him and me
well have to start doing tricks again and thats more trouble than its worth
do you do tricks also
we certainly do
and jof is a very skillful juggler
is mikael going to be an acrobat
jof wants him to be
but you dont
i dont know
smiling perhaps hell become a knight
let me assure you thats no pleasure either
no you dont look so happy
are you tired
i have dull company
do you mean your squire
no not him
who do you mean then
do you really
yes i understand rather well
i have often wondered why people torture themselves as often as they can
isnt that so
she nods energetically and the knight smiles seriously
now the shrieks and the noise from the inn become louder
black figures flicker across the grass mound
someone collapses gets up and runs
it is jof
mia stretches out her arms and receives him
he holds his hands in front of his face moaning like a child and his body sways
mia holds him close to her and sprinkles him with small anxious questions what have you done
how are you
what is it
does it hurt
what can i do
have they been cruel to you
she runs for a rag which she dips in water and carefully bathes her husbands dirty bloody face
eventually a rather sorrowful visage emerges
blood runs from a bruise on his forehead and his nose and a tooth has been loosened but otherwise jof seems unhurt
ouch it hurts
why did you have to go there
and of course you drank
mias anxiety has been replaced by a mild anger
she pats him a little harder than necessary
i didnt drink anything
then i suppose you were boasting about the angels and devils you consort with
people dont like someone who has too many ideas and fantasies
i swear to you that i didnt say a word about angels
you were of course busy singing and dancing
you can never stop being an actor
people also become angry at that and you know it
jof doesnt answer but searches for the armlet
he holds it up in front of mia with an injured expression
look what i bought for you
you couldnt afford it
angry but i got it anyhow
the armlet glitters faintly in the twilight
mia now pulls it across her wrist
they look at it in silence and their faces soften
they look at each other touch each others hands
jof puts his head against mias shoulder and sighs
oh how they beat me
why didnt you beat them back
i only become frightened and angry
i never get a chance to hit back
i can get angry you know that
i roared like a lion
were they frightened
no they just laughed
their son mikael crawls over to them
jof lies down on the ground and pulls his son on top of him
mia gets down on her hands and knees and playfully sniffs at mikael
do you notice how good he smells
and he is so compact to hold
youre a sturdy one
a real acrobats body
he lifts mikael up and holds him by the legs
mia looks up suddenly remembering the knights presence
yes this is my husband jof
jof becomes a little embarrassed and rises
all three of them look at one another silently
i have just told your wife that you have a splendid son
hell bring great joy to you
yes hes fine
they become silent again
have we nothing to offer the knight mia
thank you i dont want anything
housewifely i picked a basket of wild strawberries this afternoon
and we have a drop of milk fresh from a cow
that we were allowed to milk
so if you would like to partake of this humble fare it would be a great honor
please be seated and ill bring the food
they sit down
mia disappears with mikael
where are you going next
up to the saints feast at elsinore
i wouldnt advise you to go there
why not if i may ask
the plague has spread in that direction following the coast line south
its said that people are dying by the tens of thousands
well sometimes life is a little hard
may i suggest
jof looks at him surprised that you follow me through the forest tonight and stay at my home if you like
or go along the east coast
youll probably be safer there
mia has returned with a bowl of wild strawberries and the milk places it between them and gives each of them a spoon
i wish you good appetite
i humbly thank you
these are wild strawberries from the forest
i have never seen such large ones
they grow up there on the hillside
notice how they smell
she points with a spoon and smiles
the knight nods as if he were pondering some profound thought
jof eats heartily
your suggestion is good but i must think it over
it might be wise to have company going through the forest
its said to be full of trolls and ghosts and bandits
thats what ive heard
staunchly yes id say that its not a bad idea but i have to think about it
now that skat has left i am responsible for the troupe
after all i have become director of the whole company
mimics after all i have become director of the whole company
jons comes walking slowly down the hill closely followed by the girl
mia points with her spoon
do you want some strawberries
this man saved my life
sit down my friend and let us be together
stretches herself oh how nice this is
for a short while
one day is like another
there is nothing strange about that
the summer of course is better than the winter because in summer you dont have to be cold
but spring is best of all
i have written a poem about the spring
perhaps youd like to hear it
ill run and get my lyre
he sprints towards the wagon
not now jof
our guests may not be amused by your songs
politely by all means
i write little songs myself
for example i know a very funny song about a wanton fish which i doubt that youve heard yet
the knight looks at him
youll not get to hear it either
there are persons here who dont appreciate my art and i dont want to upset anyone
im a sensitive soul
jof has come out with his lyre sits on a small gaudy box and plucks at the instrument humming quietly searching for his melody
jons yawns and lies down
people are troubled by so much
its always better when one is two
have you no one of your own
yes i think i had someone
and what is she doing now
i dont know
you look so solemn
was she your beloved
we were newly married and we played together
we laughed a great deal
i wrote songs to her eyes to her nose to her beautiful little ears
we went hunting together and at night we danced
the house was full of life
do you want some more strawberries
shakes his head faith is a torment did you know that
it is like loving someone who is out there in the darkness but never appears no matter how loudly you call
i dont understand what you mean
everything ive said seems meaningless and unreal while i sit here with you and your husband
how unimportant it all becomes suddenly
he takes the bowl of milk in his hand and drinks deeply from it several times
then he carefully puts it down and looks up smiling
now you dont look so solemn
i shall remember this moment
the silence the twilight the bowls of strawberries and milk your faces in the evening light
mikael sleeping jof with his lyre
ill try to remember what we have talked about
ill carry this memory between my hands as carefully as if it were a bowl filled to the brim with fresh milk
he turns his face away and looks out towards the sea and the colorless gray sky
and it will be an adequate sign it will be enough for me
he rises nods to the others and walks down towards the forest
jof continues to play on his lyre
mia stretches out on the grass
the knight picks up his chess game and carries it towards the beach
it is quiet and deserted the sea is still
i have been waiting for you
i was detained for a few moments
because i revealed my tactics to you im in retreat
its your move
why do you look so satisfied
thats my secret
now i take your knight
you did the right thing
have you tricked me
you fell right in the trap
what are you laughing at
dont worry about my laughter save your king instead
youre rather arrogant
our game amuses me
its your move
im a little pressed for time
i understand that youve a lot to do but you cant get out of our game
it takes time
death is about to answer him but stops and leans over the board
the knight smiles
are you going to escort the juggler and his wife through the forest
those whose names are jof and mia and who have a small son
why do you ask
oh no reason at all
the knight suddenly stops smiling
death looks at him scornfully
immediately after sundown the little company gathers in the yard of the inn
there is the knight jons and the girl jof and mia in their wagon
their son mikael is already asleep
jonas skat is still missing
jons goes into the inn to get provisions for the night journey and to have a last mug of beer
the inn is now empty and quiet except for a few farmhands and maidens who are eating their evening meal in a corner
at one of the small windows sits a lonely hunched over fellow with a jug of brandy in his hands
his expression is very sad
once in a while he is shaken by a gigantic sob
it is plog the smith who sits there and whimpers
god in heaven isnt this plog the smith
are you sitting here sniveling in loneliness
yes yes look at the smith
he moans like a rabbit
if i were in your boots id be happy to get rid of a wife in such an easy way
jons pats the smith on the back quenches his thirst with beer and sits down by his side
are you married
a hundred times and more
i cant keep count of all my wives any longer
but its often that way when youre a traveling man
i can assure you that one wife is worse than a hundred or else ive had worse luck than any poor wretch in this miserable world which isnt impossible
yes its hell with women and hell without them
so however you look at it its still best to kill them off while its most amusing
womens nagging the shrieking of children and wet diapers sharp nails and sharp words blows and pokes and the devils aunt for a mother in law
and then when one wants to sleep after a long day theres a new song tears whining and moans loud enough to wake the dead
jons nods delightedly
he has drunk deeply and talks with an old womans voice
why dont you kiss me good night
in the same way why dont you sing a song for me
why dont you love me the way you did when we first met
why dont you look at my new slip
you only turn your back and snore
and now shes gone
furious ill snip their noses with pliers ill bash in their chests with a small hammer ill tap their heads ever so lightly with a sledge
plog begins to cry loudly and his whole body sways in an enormous attack of sorrow
jons looks at him with interest
look how he howls again
maybe i love her
so maybe you love her
then you poor misguided ham shank ill tell you that love is another word for lust plus lust plus lust and a damn lot of cheating falseness lies and all
kinds of other fooling around
yes but it hurts anyway
love is the blackest of all plagues and if one could die of it there would be some pleasure in love
but you almost always get over it
no no not me
yes you too
there are only a couple of poor wretches who die of love once in a while
love is as contagious as a cold in the nose
it eats away at your strength your independence your morale if you have any
if everything is imperfect in this imperfect world love is most perfect in its perfect imperfection
youre happy you with your oily words and besides you believe your own drivel
who said that i believed it
but i love to give good advice
if you ask me for advice youll get two pieces for the price of one because after all i really am an educated man
jons gets up from the table and strokes his face with his hands
plog becomes very unhappy and grabs his belt
may i go with you through the forest
im so lonely and dont want to go home because everyone will laugh at me
only if you dont whimper all the time because in that case well all have to avoid you
plog gets up and embraces jons
slightly drunk the two new friends walk towards the door
when they come out in the yard jof immediately catches sight of them becomes angry and yells a warning to jons
that one wants to fight all the time
hes not quite sane
yes but now hes just sniveling
plog steps up to jof who blanches with fear
plog offers his hand
im really sorry if i hurt you
but i have such a hell of a temper you know
jof gingerly proffers a frightened hand and gets it thoroughly shaken and squeezed
while jof tries to straighten out his fingers plog is seized by great good will and opens his arms
come in my arms little brother
thank you thank you perhaps later
but now were really in a hurry
jof climbs up on the wagon seat quickly and clucks at the horse
the small company is on its way towards the forest and the night
it is dark in the forest
first comes the knight on his large horse
then jof and mia follow sitting close to each other in the jugglers wagon
mia holds her son in her arms
jons follows them with his heavily laden horse
he has the smith in tow
the girl sits on top of the load on the horses back hunched over as if asleep
the footsteps the horses heavy tramp on the soft path the human breathing yet it is quiet
then the moon sails out of the clouds
the forest suddenly becomes alive with the nights unreality
the dazzling light pours through the thick foliage of the beech trees a moving quivering world of light and shadow
the wanderers stop
their eyes are dark with anxiety and foreboding
their faces are pale and unreal in the floating light
it is very quiet
now the moon has come out of the clouds
now we can see the road better
i dont like the moon tonight
the trees stand so still
thats because theres no wind
i guess he means that they stand very still
its completely quiet
if one could hear a fox at least
or an owl
or a human voice besides ones own
they say its dangerous to remain standing in moonlight
suddenly out of the silence and the dim light falling across the forest road a ghostlike cart emerges
it is the witch being taken to the place where she will be burned
next to her eight soldiers shuffle along tiredly carrying their lances on their backs
the girl sits in the cart bound with iron chains around her throat and arms
she stares fixedly into the moonlight
a black figure sits next to her a monk with his hood pulled down over his head
where are you going
to the place of execution
yes now i can see
its the girl who has done it with the black one
the soldier nods sourly
hesitantly the travelers follow
the knight guides his horse over to the side of the cart
the witch seems to be half conscious but her eyes are wide open
i see that they have hurt your hands
the witchs pale childish face turns towards the knight and she shakes her head
i have a potion that will stop your pain
she shakes her head again
why do you burn her at this time of night
people have so few diversions these days
saints preserve us be quiet
its said that she brings the devil with her wherever she goes
you are eight brave men then
well weve been paid
and this is a volunteer job
the soldier speaks in whispers while glancing anxiously at the witch
to the witch whats your name
my name is tyan my lord
how old are you
fourteen my lord
and is it true that you have been in league with the devil
tyan nods quietly and looks away
now they arrive at the parish border
at the foot of the nearby hills lies a crossroads
the pyre has already been stacked in the center of the forest clearing
the travelers remain there hesitant and curious
the soldiers have tied up the cart horse and bring out two long wooden beams
they nail rungs across the beams so that it looks like a ladder
tyan will be bound to this like an eelskin stretched out to dry
the sound of the hammering echoes through the forest
the knight has dismounted and walks closer to the cart
again he tries to catch tyans eyes touches her very lightly as if to waken her
slowly she turns her face towards him
they say that you have been in league with the devil
why do you ask
not out of curiosity but for very personal reasons
i too want to meet him
i want to ask him about god
he if anyone must know
you can see him anytime
you must do as i tell you
the knight grips the wooden rail of the cart so tightly that his knuckles whiten
tyan leans forward and joins her gaze with his
look into my eyes
the knight meets her gaze
they stare at each other for a long time
what do you see
do you see him
i see fear in your eyes an empty numb fear
but nothing else
he falls silent
the soldiers work at the stakes their hammering echoes in the forest
no one nothing no one
shakes his head no
cant you see him behind your back
looks around no there is no one there
but he is with me everywhere
i only have to stretch out my hand and i can feel his hand
he is with me now too
the fire wont hurt me
he will protect me from everything evil
has he told you this
i know it
has he said it
i know it i know it
you must see him somewhere you must
the priests had no difficulty seeing him nor did the soldiers
they are so afraid of him that they dont even dare touch me
the sounds of the hammers stops
the soldiers stand like black shadows rooted in the moss
they fumble with the chains and pull at the neck iron
tyan moans weakly as if she were far away
why have you crushed her hands
surly we didnt do it
ask the monk
the soldiers pull the iron and the chains
tyans shaven head sways gleaming in the moonlight
her blackened mouth opens as if to scream but no sound emerges
they take her down from the cart and lead her towards the ladder and the stake
the knight turns to the monk who remains seated in the cart
what have you done with the child
death turns around and looks at him
dont you ever stop asking questions
no ill never stop
the soldiers chain tyan to the rungs of the ladder
she submits resignedly moans weakly like an animal and tries to ease her body into position
when they have fastened her they walk over to light the pyre
the knight steps up and leans over her
for a moment i thought of killing the soldiers but it would do no good
shes nearly dead already
one of the soldiers approaches
thick smoke wells down from the pyre and sweeps over the quiet shadows near the crossroads and the hill
ive told you to be careful
dont go too close to her
the knight doesnt heed this warning
he cups his hand fills it with water from the skin and gives it to tyan
then he gives her a potion
take this and it will stop the pain
smoke billows down over them and they begin to cough
the soldiers step forward and raise the ladder against a nearby fir tree
tyan hangs there motionlessly her eyes wide open
the knight straightens up and stands immobile
jons is behind him his voice nearly choked with rage
what does she see
can you tell me
shakes his head she feels no more pain
you dont answer my question
who watches over that child
is it the angels or god or the devil or only the emptiness
emptiness my lord
this cannot be
look at her eyes my lord
her poor brain has just made a discovery
emptiness under the moon
we stand powerless our arms hanging at our sides because we see what she sees and our terror and hers are the same
an outburst that poor little child
i cant stand it i cant stand it
his voice sticks in his throat and he suddenly walks away
the knight mounts his horse
the travelers depart from the crossroads
tyan finally closes her eyes
the forest is now very dark
the road winds between the trees
the wagon squeaks and rattles over stones and roots
a bird suddenly shrieks
jof lifts his head and wakes up
he has been asleep with his arms around mias shoulders
the knight is sharply silhouetted against the tree trunks
his silence makes him seem almost unreal
jons and plog are slightly drunk and support each other
suddenly plog has to sit down
he puts his hands over his face and howls piteously
oh now it came over me again
what came over you
my wife damn it
she is so beautiful
she is so beautiful that she cant be described without the accompaniment of a lyre
now it starts again
her smile is like brandy
her eyes like blackberries
plog searches for beautiful words
he gestures gropingly with his large hands
sighs get up you tear drenched pig
well lose the others
yes of course of course
her nose is like a little pink potato her behind is like a juicy pear yes the whole woman is like a strawberry patch
i can see her in front of me with arms like wonderful cucumbers
saints almighty stop
youre a very bad poet despite the fact that youre drunk
and your vegetable garden bores me
they walk across an open meadow
here it is a little brighter and the moon shimmers behind a thin sky
suddenly plog points a large finger towards the edge of the forest
do you see something
there over there
i dont see anything
hang on to something my friends
the hour is near
who is that at the edge of the forest if not my own dearly beloved with actor attached
the two lovers discover plog and its too late
they cannot retreat
skat immediately takes to his heels
plog chases him swinging his sledge and bellowing like a wild boar
for a few confusing moments the two rivals stumble among the stones and bushes in the gray gloom of the forest
the duel begins to look senseless because both of them are equally frightened
the travelers silently observe this confused performance
lisa screams once in a while more out of duty than out of impulse
panting you miserable stubbleheaded bastard of seven scurvy bitches if i were in your lousy rags i would be stricken with such eternal shame about my breath my voice my
arms and legs in short about my whole body that i would immediately rid nature of my own embarrassing self
angry watch out you perfumed slob that i dont fart on you and immediately blow you down to the actors own red hot hell where you can sit and recite
monologues to each other until the dust comes out of the devils ears
then lisa throws herself around her husbands neck
forgive me dear little husband ill never do it again
i am so sorry and you cant imagine how terribly that man over there betrayed me
ill kill him anyway
yes do that just kill him
he isnt even a human being
hell hes an actor
he is only a false beard false teeth false smiles rehearsed lines and hes as empty as a jug
just kill him
lisa sobs with excitement and sorrow
plog looks around a little confused
skat uses this opportunity
he pulls out a dagger and places the point against his breast
just kill me
if you thought that i was going to apologize for being what i am you are mistaken
look how sickening he is
how he makes a fool of himself how he puts on an act
dear plog kill him
my friends you have only to push and my unreality will soon be transformed into a new solid reality
an absolutely tangible corpse
do something then
embarrassed he has to fight me otherwise i cant kill him
your lifes thread now hangs by a very ragged shred
idiot your day is short
youll have to irritate me a little more to get me as angry as before
skat looks at the travelers with a pained expression and then lifts his eyes towards the night sky
i forgive all of you
pray for me sometimes
skat sinks the dagger into his breast and slowly falls to the ground
the travelers stand confused
plog rushes forward and begins to pull at skats hands
oh dear dear i didnt mean it that way
look theres no life left in him
i was beginning to like him and in my opinion lisa was much too spiteful
jof leans over his colleague
hes dead totally enormously dead
in fact ive never seen such a dead actor
come on lets go
this is nothing to mourn over
he has only himself to blame
and i have to be married to her
we must go on
skat lies in the grass and keeps the dagger pressed tightly to his breast
the travelers depart and soon they have disappeared into the dark forest on the other side of the meadow
when skat is sure that no one can see him he sits up and lifts the dagger from his breast
it is a stage dagger with a blade that pushes into the handle
skat laughs to himself
now that was a good scene
im really a good actor
after all why shouldnt i be a little pleased with myself
but where shall i go
ill wait until it becomes light and then ill find the easiest way out of the forest
ill climb up a tree for the time being so that no bears wolves or ghosts can get at me
he soon finds a likely tree and climbs up into its thick foliage
he sits down as comfortably as possible and reaches for his food pouch
yawns tomorrow ill find jof and mia and then well go to the saints feast in elsinore
well make lots of money there
yawns now ill sing a little song to myself sings i am a little bird who sings whateer he will and when i am in danger i fling out a
pissing trill as in the carnal thrill
speaks its boring to be alone in the forest tonight
sings the terrible night doesnt frighten me
he interrupts himself and listens
the sound of industrious sawing is heard through the silence
workmen in the forest
sings the terrible night doesnt frighten me
speaks hey what the devil
its my tree theyre cutting down
he peers through the foliage
below him stands a dark figure diligently sawing away at the base of the tree
skat becomes frightened and angry
do you hear me you tricky bastard
what are you doing with my tree
the sawing continues without a pause
skat becomes more frightened
cant you at least answer me
politeness costs so little
who are you
death straightens his back and squints up at him
skat cries out in terror
im sawing down your tree because your time is up
it wont do
i havent got time
so you havent got time
no i have my performance
then its canceled because of death
your contract is terminated
my children my family
shame on you skat
yes im ashamed
death begins to saw again
the tree creaks
isnt there any way to get off
arent there any special rules for actors
no not in this case
no loopholes no exceptions
perhaps youll take a bribe
the tree falls
the forest becomes silent again
night and then dawn
the travelers have come to a sort of clearing and have collapsed on the moss
they lie quietly and listen to their own breathing their heartbeats and the wind in the tree tops
here the forest is wild and impenetrable
huge boulders stick up out of the ground like the heads of black giants
a fallen tree lies like a mighty barrier between light and shadow
mia jof and their child have sat down apart from the others
they look at the light of the moon which is no longer full and dead but mysterious and unstable
the knight sits bent over his chess game
lisa cries quietly behind plogs back
jons lies on the ground and looks up at the heavens
soon dawn will come but the heat continues to hang over us like a smothering blanket
im so frightened
we feel that something is going to happen to us but we dont know what
maybe its the day of judgment
the day of judgment
now something moves behind the fallen tree
there is a rustling sound and a moaning cry that seems to come from a wounded animal
everyone listens intently all faces turned towards the sound
a voice comes out of the darkness
do you have some water
ravals perspiring face soon becomes visible
he disappears in the darkness but his voice is heard again
cant you give me a little water
pause i have the plague
dont come here
if you do ill slit your throat
keep to the other side of the tree
im afraid of death
no one answers
there is complete silence
raval gasps heavily for air
the dry leaves rustle with his movements
i dont want to die
i dont want to
no one answers
ravals face appears suddenly at the base of the tree
his eyes bulge wildly and his mouth is ringed with foam
cant you have pity on me
at least talk to me
no one answers
the trees sigh
raval begins to cry
i am going to die
what will happen to me
can no one console me
havent you any compassion
cant you see that i
his words are choked off by a gurgling sound
he disappears in the darkness behind the fallen tree
it becomes quiet for a few moments
whispers cant anyone
only a little water
suddenly the girl gets up with a quick movement snatches jonss water bag and runs a few steps
jons grabs her and holds her fast
its no use
its no use
i know that its no use
its totally meaningless
i tell you that its meaningless
cant you hear that im consoling you
help me help me
no one answers no one moves
ravals sobs are dry and convulsive like a frightened childs
his sudden scream is cut off in the middle
then it becomes quiet
the girl sinks down and hides her face in her hands
jons places his hand on her shoulder
the knight is no longer alone
death has come to him and he raises his hand
shall we play our game to the end
death raises his hand and strikes the knights queen
antonius block looks at now i take your queen
i didnt notice that
the knight leans over the game
the moonlight moves over the chess pieces which seem to have a life of their own
jof has dozed off for a few moments but suddenly he wakens
then he sees the knight and death together
he becomes very frightened and awakens mia
yes what is it
i see something terrible
something i almost cant talk about
what do you see
the knight is sitting over there playing chess
yes i can see that too and i dont think its so terrible
but do you see who hes playing with
he is alone
you mustnt frighten me this way
no no he isnt alone
who is it then
he is sitting there playing chess with death himself
you mustnt say that
we must try to escape
one cant do that
we must try
they are so occupied with their game that if we move very quietly they wont notice us
jof gets up carefully and disappears into the darkness behind the trees
mia remains standing as if paralyzed by fear
she stares fixedly at the knight and the chess game
she holds her son in her arms
now jof returns
i have harnessed the horse
the wagon is standing near the big tree
you go first and ill follow you with the packs
see that mikael doesnt wake up
mia does what jof has told her
at the same moment the knight looks up from his game
it is your move antonius block
the knight remains silent
he sees mia go through the moonlight towards the wagon
jof bends down to pick up the pack and follows at a distance
have you lost interest in our game
the knights eyes become alarmed
death looks at him intently
on the contrary
you seem anxious
are you hiding anything
nothing escapes you or does it
nothing escapes me
no one escapes from me
its true that im worried
he pretends to be clumsy and knocks the chess pieces over with the hem of his coat
he looks up at death
ive forgotten how the pieces stood
laughs contentedly but i have not forgotten
you cant get away that easily
death leans over the board and rearranges the pieces
the knight looks past him towards the road
mia has just climbed up on the wagon
jof takes the horse by the bridle and leads it down the road
death notices nothing he is completely occupied with reconstructing the game
now i see something interesting
what do you see
you are mated on the next move antonius block
did you enjoy your reprieve
yes i did
im happy to hear that
now ill be leaving you
when we meet again you and your companions time will be up
and you will divulge your secrets
i have no secrets
so you know nothing
i have nothing to tell
the knight wants to answer but death is already gone
a murmur is heard in the tree tops
dawn comes a flickering light without life making the forest seem threatening and evil
jof drives over the twisting road
mia sits beside him
what a strange light
i guess its the thunderstorm which comes with dawn
no its something else
do you hear the roar in the forest
its probably rain
no it isnt rain
he has seen us and hes following us
he has overtaken us hes coming towards us
not yet mia
in any case not yet
im so afraid
im so afraid
the wagon rattles over roots and stones it sways and creaks
now the horse stops with his ears flat against his head
the forest sighs and stirs ponderously
get into the wagon mia
crawl in quickly
well lie down mia with mikael between us
they crawl into the wagon and crouch around the sleeping child
it is the angel of death thats passing over us mia
its the angel of death
the angel of death and hes very big
do you feel how cold it is
im terribly cold
she shivers as if she had a fever
they pull the blankets over them and lie closely together
the wagon canvas flutters and beats in the wind
the roar outside is like a giant bellowing
the castle is silhouetted like a black boulder against the heavy dawn
now the storm moves there throwing itself powerfully against walls and abutments
the sky darkens it is almost like night
antonius block has brought his companions with him to the castle
but it seems deserted
they walk from room to room
there is only emptiness and quiet echoes
outside the rain is heard roaring noisily
suddenly the knight stands face to face with his wife
they look at each other quietly
i heard from people who came from the crusade that you were on your way home
ive been waiting for you here
all the others have fled from the plague
the knight is silent
he looks at her
dont you recognize me any more
the knight nods silent
you also have changed
she walks closer and looks searchingly into his face
the smile lingers in her eyes and she touches his hand lightly
now i can see that its you
somewhere in your eyes somewhere in your face but hidden and frightened is that boy who went away so many years ago
its over now and im a little tired
i see that youre tired
over there stand my friends
ask them in
they will break the fast with us
they all sit down at the table in the room which is lit by torches on the walls
silently they eat the hard bread and the salt darkened meat
karin sits at the head of the table and reads aloud from a thick book
and when the lamb broke the seventh seal there was silence in heaven for about the space of half an hour
and i saw the seven angels which stood before god and to them were given seven trumpets
three mighty knocks sound on the large portal
karin interrupts her reading and looks up from the book
jons rises quickly and goes to open the door
the first angel sounded and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood and they were cast upon the earth and the third part of the trees was burnt up
and all the green grass was burnt up
now the rain becomes quiet
there is suddenly an immense frightening silence in the large murky room where the burning torches throw uneasy shadows over the ceiling and the walls
everyone listens tensely to the stillness
and the second angel sounded and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea and a third part of the sea became blood
steps are heard on the stairs
jons returns and sits down silently at his place but does not continue to eat
was someone there
no my lord
i saw no one
karin lifts her head for a moment but once again leans over the large book
and the third angel sounded and there fell a great star from heaven burning as it were a torch and it fell upon the third part of the rivers and
upon the fountains of waters and the name of the star is called wormwood
they all lift their heads and when they see who is coming towards them through the twilight of the large room they rise from the table and stand close together
good morning noble lord
i am karin the knights wife and welcome you courteously to my house
i am a smith by profession and rather good at my trade if i say so myself
my wife lisa curtsy for the great lord lisa
shes a little difficult to handle once in a while and we had a little spat so to speak but no worse than most people
the knight hides his face in his hands
from our darkness we call out to thee lord
have mercy on us because we are small and frightened and ignorant
bitterly in the darkness where you are supposed to be where all of us probably are
in the darkness you will find no one to listen to your cries or be touched by your sufferings
wash your tears and mirror yourself in your indifference
god you who are somewhere who must be somewhere have mercy upon us
i could have given you an herb to purge you of your worries about eternity
now it seems to be too late
but in any case feel the immense triumph of this last minute when you can still roll your eyes and move your toes
i shall be silent but under protest
on her knees it is the end
jof and mia sit close together and listen to the rain tapping lightly on the wagon canvas a sound which diminishes until finally there are only single drops
they crawl out of their hiding place
the wagon stands on a height above a slope protected by an enormous tree
they look across ridges forests the wide plains and the sea which glistens in the sunlight breaking through the clouds
jof stretches his arms and legs
mia dries the wagon seat and sits down next to her husband
mikael crawls between jofs knees
a lone bird tests its voice after the storm
the trees and bushes drip
from the sea comes a strong and fragrant wind
jof points to the dark retreating sky where summer lightning glitters like silver needles over the horizon
i see them mia
i see them
over there against the dark stormy sky
they are all there
the smith and lisa and the knight and raval and jns and skat
and death the severe master invites them to dance
he tells them to hold each others hands and then they must tread the dance in a long row
and first goes the master with his scythe and hourglass but skat dangles at the end with his lyre
they dance away from the dawn and its a solemn dance towards the dark lands while the rain washes their faces and cleans the salt of the tears from their
he is silent
he lowers his hand
his son mikael has listened to his words
now he crawls up to mia and sits down in her lap
smiling you with your visions and dreams
