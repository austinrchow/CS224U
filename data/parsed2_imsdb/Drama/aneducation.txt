written by nick hornby a nice girls school in a south west london suburb
we see girls doing what girls did in a nice girls school in walking with books on their heads practising their handwriting making cakes playing lacrosse dancing with each other
in one of the classrooms miss stubbs an attractive bright animated schoolteacher is talking to a small group of sixteen year old girls
some of these girls seem to be daydreaming looking out of the window examining their fingernails
a couple including a bespectacled girl who looks five years younger than everyone else in the class write down everything the teacher says
only one jenny beautiful and animated seems to be listening in the spirit in which miss stubbs would like her to listen
shes smiling eyes shining she loves miss stubbs and these lessons
miss stubbs asks a question and jenny puts up her hand the only one in the class to do so
mock sighing jenny
isnt it because mr rochesters blind
books about ponies a much loved teddy bear a cello huge in the small room leans against the wall
jenny is bent over a small desk
victorian novels latin primers and dictionaries teeter in huge towers either side of her
she stands and stretches as she turns to us
she kneels and flicks through her half dozen or so lps on the floor near a cheap record player theyre all classical mostly by elgar apart from a juliette greco
this is the one she chooses
as the music begins she sings along
immediately there is a thumping noise someone underneath her is banging on the ceiling impatiently
i dont want to hear any french singing
french singing wasnt on the syllabus last time i looked
jenny sighs and reaches for the volume control
she turns the music down so low that she has to lie down and put her head right next to the dansette to hear it
close on jenny as she silently mouths the words along with the almost inaudible track
jenny her mother and father are finishing sunday lunch
jennys father jack is in his forties marjorie her mother is slightly younger than jack but every bit as middle aged
the food is grey and brown in keeping with the colour scheme of the house
they arent talking theyre listening to mantovani on the radio
jenny gets up from the lunch table
ive got an english essay to do by tomorrow morning
i dont want to hear anything through the ceiling this afternoon apart from the sound of sweat dripping onto textbooks
i thought we agreed that cello was my interest or hobby
its already your interest or hobby
when they ask you whats your interest or hobby
at your oxford interview you can say cello
that wouldnt be a lie
you dont need to practise a hobby
a hobby is a hobby
ignoring her you dont need to be good at it
you just have to be interested in it
can i stop going to the youth orchestra then
the orchestra shows youre a joiner inner
universities like joiner inners
ive already joined in
so now i can stop
well if you stop that shows the opposite doesnt it
that shows youre a rebel
they dont want that at oxford
they dont want people who think for themselves
missing the sarcasm as is his wont course they dont
jenny with cello sits in the string section
everyone is getting settled tuning up latecomers still arriving
along the row from jenny tuning his violin is a nice looking boy of her age graham and she waves at him
two year old boys sitting between them wave too parodically and then blow kisses much to grahams embarrassment and jennys fury
the silly boys dissolve in fits of giggles this is clearly one of the funniest moments of their lives until one of them farts noisily and it would appear from
all the frantic gesturing pungently
the comic value of the fart tops even the comic value of the wave and they are scarcely able to stay seated such is their mirth
jenny and graham are talking while he struggles to take his bike out of a bicycle rack slightly unbalanced by the violin strapped to his back
graham is nervous chronically unconfident and shy
should i wear you know sunday best
youd better im afraid
just to show my father youre un jeune homme serieux not a teddy boy
itll be all right
i wont wait
its going to bucket down in a minute
ill see you at the weekend
jenny moves as quickly as she can towards the street
the two silly boys from before arrive to blow more kisses
see you at the weekend
i will miss you with all of my heart
jenny swipes the chief offender over the head with her sheet music
the rain has begun
jenny attempts to cover herself
a mother and two children cross the road in front of her and a beautiful sleek red sports car a bristol stops to let them across
david possibly in his mid thirties dapper and almost but not quite handsome is driving the car
david distracted impatient spots jenny at the bus stop
in front of the car a small wellington boot drops off the foot of one of the children further slowing down their painfully slow progress across the road
jenny is wet
david makes eye contact
jenny smiles ruefully and enchantingly
david sighs and then hesitates for a moment
the window of the bristol slowly rolls down
jenny ignores him
if youve got any sense you wouldnt take a lift from a strange man
jenny smiles thinly
i am however a music lover and im worried about your cello
so what i propose is you put it in the car and walk alongside me
how do i know you wont just drive off with the cello
he winds down the other window and waves on the cars that have stopped behind him
how much does a new cello cost
i dont know
lets say thirty
he pulls out a wallet takes out three ten pound notes hands them to her
jenny laughs and waves the money away
the cello is in the back seat of the bristol
jenny is trotting alongside the car while david leans nonchalantly across the passenger seat to talk to her while driving
im david by the way
she says nothing
and you are
beat ive never seen a car like this before
cest tres chic
its a bristol
not many of em made
jenny nods but doesnt know how to respond
how did the concert go
it was a rehearsal
the concerts next thursday
what are you playing
making a face elgar
i often think its a shame he spent so much time in worcester dont you
worcesters too near birmingham
and you can hear that in the music
theres a horrible brummy accent in there if you listen hard enough
jenny looks at him and smiles
she hadnt expected him to be able to make elgar jokes
anyway im not sure elgar and jews mix very well
im not a jew
she smiles awkwardly
can i sit in the car with my cello
david stops the car
jenny shuts the door and sinks approvingly into the white leather seat
david regards the dripping girl with amusement
its even nicer on the inside
where to madam
jenny makes a face
i only live round the corner
what a shame
well just make it last as long as we can
the bristol is crawling along the road at walking pace
david reaches across jenny while driving slowly opens the glove compartment and takes out a packet of cigarettes
id better not
im a bit close to home
david lights one for himself
i suppose cellists must go to a lot of concerts
we dont go to any concerts
we dont believe in them
oh theyre real
so people say
why dont we believe in them
what would he say
your father this is
darkly oh yes
hed say theres no point to them
theyre just for fun
apart from school concerts of course which are no fun at all so we go to those
the proper ones dont help you get on
which of course is what is so wonderful about them
anyway youll go one day
sometimes it seems as though thats what all this slog is for
if i get to university im going to read what i want and think about what i want and listen to what i want
and im going to look at paintings and go to french films and talk to people who know lots about lots
good for you
if im lucky
did you go anywhere
i studied at what i believe they call the university of life
and i didnt get a very good degree there
this is me
she gets out of the car with the cello
david stares after her for a moment then drives off
jenny her parents and graham are eating afternoon tea neat fish paste sandwiches battenberg cake best china
hows your mother graham
shes fine thanks
she sends her best by the way
where are you applying graham
jenny looks embarrassed
she knows whats coming
im not sure yet
well when will you be sure
you cant let the grass grow under your feet you know
otherwise youll be at the back of the queue
deadpan i suppose so
i suppose the growing grass would knock you off balance and then youd fall over and by the time you picked yourself up thered be a queue
her father shoots her a look is she being cheeky
i might take a year off
jack looks at him as if hes just said hell take all his clothes off
mumbling i dont know
maybe do some travelling that sort of thing
what are you a teddy boy
close up of jenny she knows whats coming and cant bear it
nodding at jenny you know shes going to oxford dont you
if we can get her latin up to scratch
so shes studying english at oxford while youre a wandering jew
jenny looks at him curiously
graham steels himself to speak
im not a teddy boy
im an homme serieux
an homme jeune serieux homme
jenny winces again
her father stares at graham
its the night of the youth orchestra concert
jenny her mother and father are on their way out of the door
jack is carrying the cello
jenny is in her school uniform with her hair scrubbed back in a severe ponytail
the three of them are flustered
jenny opens the front door for her father and he stumbles outside
she has seen something on the doorstep and she stoops to pick it up a large bunch of flowers
theyre for me
curious who are they from
jenny opens the card thats attached to them
a chap i met
a chap who sends flowers
so hes a man chap
yes he is really
jack stares at the flowers in disbelief
the bunch of flowers has created in jack the kind of panic and fear more typically associated with a biochemical attack
whats going on here
drily knowing the trouble this will cause jack im afraid jenny has been sent some flowers by a chap
what kind of chap
patiently hes wishing me luck for tonight
are you sure thats all hes wishing
and where does he get the money from
he earns it i expect
what do you mean he earns it
why isnt he at school
what does he do
can we just go
otherwise the bunch of good luck flowers will actually be responsible for me actually missing the concert
which would be ironic nest ce pas
well i dont like it
ten bobs worth of luck i reckon
thats a lot for a schoolgirl
you cant leave them out here anyway
id burgle a house that had flowers outside
theyll think were made of money
jenny sighs puts them inside the house shuts the door
jenny and two school friends hattie and tina are sitting at a table in a typical late s coffee bar sipping cappuccinos
jenny is easily the most attractive of the three and also we will see possibly the cleverest
hattie is slower than the other two and a lot frumpier tina is pretty and sharp rather than clever
she is also the least middle class of the three shes clearly a scholarship girl
they are all dressed in an unflattering and unambiguous school uniform no attempts to disguise it with more fashionable accessories
jenny is smoking pretentiously and seems to be practising some kind of pout
tina starts to slurp the froth from her cappuccino with a spoon inelegantly and noisily
jenny tuts her disapproval
tina sighs and puts her spoon down
the whole point about him is that he doesnt feel
we still dont have to like him
camus doesnt want you to like him
what hes trying to say is that feeling is bourgeois
being engagee is bourgeois
his mother dies and he doesnt feel anything
he kills this arab and he doesnt feel anything
i wouldnt feel anything if my mother died
does that make me an existentialist
that just makes you a cow
jenny hattie and tina emerge from the cafe talking
well im going to be french
im going to paris and im going to smoke and listen to jacques brel and wear black
and i wont speak
cest plus chic comme
she breaks off
parked outside a tobacconists on the other side of the road is the red bristol
she looks towards the shop and david emerges with a copy of the times and a packet of cigars
jenny crosses the road to talk to him while the others watch
how did it go
i mean i didnt mess my bit up anyway
and no one got thrown out of the orchestra afterwards
always the mark of a cultural triumph
im glad i ran into you
what are you doing on friday
going to school
i meant the evening
because im going to listen to some schubert in st johns smith square
my friends danny and helen will be going too so it wouldnt be
ill tell you what
ill come and pick you up and if your mother and father disapprove then you can have the tickets and go with one of them
how does that sound
jenny doesnt know what to say
she looks at david and his eagerness to please seems to convince her
and id like you to take me
id like to go with someone who knows when to clap
i usually watch danny
he knows that sort of thing
and well probably go for a spot of supper afterwards if you
but if you if thats not
well we can always put you in a taxi
flat disbelief supper
if you want
the trouble is well already have eaten
i mean if youd like supper then perhaps on friday you could
embarrassed again oh
jenny smiles and rejoins her friends on the other side of the road
tina and hattie are standing there almost with their mouths open amazed
she doesnt say anything and starts to walk on
i just had the strangest dream
i dreamed you crossed the road and spoke to a handsome man with the most beautiful car ive ever seen
and then you came back and you didnt mention it
jenny smiles enigmatically
tina grabs jenny mock urgently
light playful just a man whos been trying to pick me up
were going to a concert on friday night
and then were having a spot of supper
shrieking a spot of supper
youve heard of supper
weve heard of it
but weve never eaten it
neither of you is interested in the concert part i notice
of course not
oh my god
ive only just realised
thats whats going to happen to you isnt it
look at her
men are going to pick her up in the street and take her out to supper
god youre right tina
i hadnt thought of that
look at her
dont be so daft
were trying to attract the attention of boys
and shes fighting off men
youre going to have to tell us more than that
because no mans ever going to ask us out to supper
not until were ladies anyway
youre going to have to tell us everything
otherwise its not fair
there wont be anything to tell
well make something up then
jenny is dressed up for her evening out
she looks good but also stiff uncomfortable shes not herself in her dress which looks too old for her
her father is standing in front of her shouting
i wont allow it
hes quite happy for you to take me
where is it
st johns smith square
i dont know
im sure we could find out
marjorie comes into the room
its in westminster
just around the corner from the abbey
jack looks at her as if shed just given directions to the nearest opium den
how dyou know that
i had a life before we were married you know
he soon put a stop to that
there we are
where are we
near westminster abbey
im not going all the way over there
the trouble is thats where st johns smith square is
and ive just said
thats where im not going
there must be something on locally
wheres the paper
jack she wants to see someone who can play
she doesnt want to see sheila kirkland scratching away
ill take her
and how are you going to get over there
the doorbell rings
oh bloody hell
jenny starts towards the door and then turns
oh and by the way
davids a jew
a wandering jew
so watch yourself
she goes to the door
panic stricken and shouting whats she talking about
ive never said anything like that in my life
anyway its just an expression
im not against the jews
jenny comes back in with david who is dressed stylishly in his early s young executive leisurewear sports jacket slacks cashmere sweater
he looks out of place he is brighter and brasher than his surroundings the most colourful thing in the room and he seems intimidatingly exotic
david has obviously heard jacks last line
pleasantly im glad to hear it
he offers his hand
i didnt mean im not against you
actually i did mean that because im not but
davids hand is still extended in his confusion and embarrassment jack hasnt yet taken it
he does so now and shakes it for way too long
what im saying is that youre not the sort of of person id be against if i were the sort of person who was against
youre not an old
im jack and this is marjorie
deadpan you didnt tell me you had a sister jenny
general confusion until david chuckles naughtily
marjorie giggles and then offers her hand
youre a lucky man jack
i suppose i am yes
they all sit down
he looks around approvingly
this is lovely
im sorry david
can i get you a drink
id love one jack but were running a little late
if jennys ready perhaps well shoot off
jenny looks at her father and takes a calculated gamble
dads got something to tell you
no no nothing
it was more of a question really
how would you get to st johns smith square from here
for future reference
oh its a pretty straight run really
up to hammersmith take the a through kensington and youre there
simple as that
simple as that
jack smiles broadly
playfully so shall i book some tickets for something
still smiling no
back by ten please david
shes usually in bed by then
i was hoping jenny would come with me afterwards to have a bite of supper with my aunt helen
jenny studies him carefully
suddenly his friends danny and helen have become aunt helen
oh well i suppose
how about if i promise to have her in by eleven thirty
well its friday night
and if youre going out to the west end
i appreciate it
see you again
they exchange warm handshakes
he turns to marjorie
marjorie extends her hand
david takes it but kisses it suavely leaving her a little flustered
have a nice time
jenny and david leave
sniffing the air whats that smell
has he got perfume on
its called after shave jack
and it makes a change from carbolic soap
at least theres no confusion if you smell of carbolic soap
marjorie rolls her eyes
nobodys ever going to get confused about you dear
jenny and david walk toward the beautiful hall
jenny suddenly looks young in the dress that looks too old for her other adults are milling around outside and the women dont look like girls dressed up
david makes for an incredibly glamorous and attractive couple in their late twenties who are waiting outside danny and helen
helen is as far from anyones idea of an aunt as one can get
shes no more beautiful than jenny but shes dressed both appropriately and spectacularly in early s pre hippy bohemian gear
she turns heads in a way that jenny is not yet able to
danny too is attractive but soberly so
david and jenny are in a way paler less striking versions of these two
are we late
i was hoping wed miss the beginning and then it wouldnt be worth going in and we could go off dancing or something
helen is one of the more reluctant members of tonights audience
jenny and david laugh politely
jenny these are my friends helen and danny
jenny shakes hands with the two of them
they both give her fascinated and clearly appraising looks
they have heard about her
they walk into the hall
its a beautiful hall jenny is dazzled by the surroundings and the company
shes particularly bowled over by helen
we can leave our coats over there
i want to get rid of this
she nods at the coat shes carrying
jenny looks thrilled at the prospect of spending a couple of minutes with helen
danny hands helen his coat without saying anything
the girls walk over to another reception table a few yards away behind which is a cloakroom
a lady is exchanging overcoats for tickets
almost involuntarily jenny touches the sleeve of helens velvety jacket
she stops herself
im so sorry
amused thats ok
its nice isnt it
where did it come from
oh south ken somewhere
helen looks at jennys outfit her frumpy smart dress apparently wanting to return the compliment
nodding at the dress this is
well its good for this sort of concert isnt it
quietly thank you
helen is now at the front of the queue and hands her coat over imperiously
we should go shopping together one day if you want
she takes a ticket from the cloakroom lady
that would be nice
but south ken
cest beaucoup trop cher pour moi
they stare at each other
helen is bewildered jenny embarrassed
i just said
it was too expensive for me
no you didnt
you said something completely different
well i said it in french
jenny feels humiliated she is yet to realise what we can see that helen is simply very dim
i dont know
jenny looks away
helen stares at her
the performance bell rings and they make their way back to the men
to jennys surprise and pleasure helen links arms with her as they walk
its too expensive for me too
we dont have to worry about that
if you want something in south ken get david to take you shopping
why on earth would he want to take me shopping
helen makes a knowing face
david jenny danny and helen in a row in the middle of the auditorium watching the stage and listening to the music
jenny cant concentrate shes too excited by the occasion and the company
jenny sneaks a glance at helen who stares straight ahead unblinking and enigmatic
david is smiling as if hes trying to communicate enjoyment dannys eyes flicker across the stage he understands the music its component parts which musicians are contributing what
jenny takes it all in
jenny david danny and helen emerge with the other concert goers
i booked a table at juliettes
will that kill the mood do you think
oh i do hope so
the others laugh
i always think im going to my own funeral when i listen to classical music
tentatively that was classical wasnt it
as classical as you can get
helen looks pleased
juliettes it is then
heaven forbid that we should end the evening reflecting on our own mortality
jenny smiles in delight
shes never met people like this
a singer in the julie london mould is singing im in the mood for love while cigarette girls and glamorous waitresses patrol the tables
jenny is sitting with the others at a table in the club eating and talking
she looks about twelve but shes thrilled to be there
we know now that her life can never be the same again and there will be no going back to fish paste sandwiches with spotty graham
have you never heard chante francoise sagan
jenny shakes her head
her eyes are wide shes clearly awe struck
david offers her a cigarette a gitane which she takes
he lights it for her while shes listening
oh its wonderful
ive only got
well i think its just called juliette greco
the one with the eyes on the sleeve
i saved up and got my french conversation teacher to bring it back after christmas
youve got a french conversation teacher
is that why you suddenly speak french for no reason
ignoring her you must have seen her sing
jenny shakes her head again and smiles
where would she have seen juliette greco
danny meanwhile is baffled
who hasnt seen juliette greco
but you should see her in paris not here
david will take you
id love to
youd fit right in
sympathetically better than here really
its wonderful to find a young person who wants to know things
theres so much i want you to see
they sip their drinks pensively possibly to allow time for the double entendre to disappear into the smoke
are you still all right to come and have a look at that pembroke villas place with me on friday danny
cant do it
theres a burne jones coming up at christies on friday
and i want it
laughing in disbelief youre thinking of buying a burne jones
a real one
i just have a feeling that the pre raphaelites are going to take off
i love the pre raphaelites
excited by her education do you
yes of course
rossetti and burne jones anyway
not holman hunt so much
hes so garish
danny looks at her
theres clearly more to this schoolgirl than he thought
why dont we all go to the auction
wouldnt that be fun
next friday morning
david will pick you up
she doesnt want to explain why
helen looks at him aghast
why has he started speaking french
are you sure youre busy
im sure i could
that would be lovely
jenny lets herself quietly into the house
the hallway is dark but she can hear noises from the kitchen
she pokes her head round the corner and sees her mother doing the washing up
oh hello love
did you have a nice time
what are you doing
i cant get this casserole dish clean
we had hot pot tonight and its all burnt round
its twenty five to twelve
we finish tea at seven
i know what the time is
how was your evening
it was the best night of my life
and he took you home in his car
right to the door
jenny looks at her
she doesnt seem to have heard what jenny has just said
and im glad you enjoyed the concert
jenny hattie and tina are sitting on their desks waiting for the start of a lesson
nine or ten classmates are scattered around the room talking distractedly but jennys group is much more animated tina and hattie are leaning forward listening to jenny their eyes bright
they are clearly awestruck by jennys tales of the outside world
to hattie im not interested in schubert
i want to know what else was on the programme
there was nothing like that
he was the perfect gentleman
he just said he wanted to take me places and show me things
oh my gawd
the english teacher miss stubbs young and fresh faced and lively looking enters and picks up on the excitement of jennys coterie
i knew that in the end jane eyre would work its magic upon you
im presuming thats what youre so animated about
the students start to sit down at desks in a more conventional arrangement
jane eyre and jennys new boyfriend
hes not my new boyfriend
hes more a man friend isnt he
hes got a sports car miss stubbs
a mr rochester figure
i think he must be as blind as mr rochester
jenny pulls a face at her
is there no end to your thirst for literary understanding jenny
as you may have noticed im attempting to turn the subject away from jennys lurid love life and towards the matter in hand
she starts to hand out essays
and its quite clear on this evidence that most of you know much too much about the former and almost nothing about the latter
reluctantly i must concede that jenny is evidently an expert on both matters
excellent as always jenny
miss stubbs slaps an essay down on jennys desk
we can see that its marked a
jenny at her desk working
she puts down her pen distracted
david sitting in his bristol waiting
we see the bristol parked outside and jenny walking towards it a small figure in a large playground
shes clearly just changed out of her school uniform and shes making last minute adjustments to her civvies
a teacher walks towards her and jenny almost freezes but the teacher merely smiles pleasantly and walks past
jenny keeps walking at a measured pace for a moment and then breaks into a run
jenny and david are driving along a north kensington street
how do you know danny
david is distracted
hes driving slowly apparently looking for an address
oh you know
we kept bumping into each other and we became pals and weve ended up doing a bit of work together when it suits us
what kind of work
a bit of art dealing
some buying and selling
this and that
he stops the car
ill be two seconds
he gets out of the car and jenny watches him as he crosses the road
outside a dilapidated house covered in scaffolding stands a large west indian family mother father three or four small children and a dog
they are surrounded by what appears to be all their worldly goods
david squats down on his haunches talks to the kids tousles the hair of the smallest
then he takes out a bunch of keys and ushers the family down the path
he unlocks the door and leads them inside
in an upper window of the house we see an old lady peering down anxiously
david emerges from the house jangling his keys
jenny opens the glove compartment where david keeps his cigarettes takes out the packet removes one for herself offers the packet to david as he gets into the car
he lights them both
im sorry about that
how do you know those those negro people
jenny darling even schwarzers have to live somewhere
and its not as if they can rent off their own kind is it
he starts the car and drives off
im not sure i quite understand what you do
you dont need to
its too boring
all you need to know is that i work in property so that i can take you to nice places
jennys pov of the black family in one window and the little old lady disappearing from another
danny intent on a catalogue helen gazing dreamily into space as david and jenny push their way through the crowded auction room
the auctioneer burbles on in the background
you nearly missed it
jenny is in awe of rich london in all its finery
the auctioneer clears his throat
we turn to lot the tree of forgiveness by sir edward burne jones
this is a rare opportunity to purchase a key work of the pre raphaelite movement
who will start me off at five hundred guineas
jenny glances at danny
he makes no move at this price
neither does anyone else
hes poised and listening hard
a middle aged lady the epitome of the middle aged contemporary sloane twin set pearls and a lot of face powder raises her hand
thank you madam
a man raises his hand
do i hear three fifty
the middle aged sloane nods
over to you sir
four hundred guineas
four hundred and fifty
danny continues to sit there
jenny is confused
the middle aged lady bids four fifty
david sitting next to danny whispers something to him
whispers to jenny your turn
jenny looks at him
no further bids
jenny raises her hand high just as shed do at school
five hundred guineas from the very eager new bidder
people look round and smile when they see who has come in
jenny blushes but stares fixedly ahead
five hundred and fifty madam
jenny looks at david who nods
six hundred guineas
jenny gestures more economically
thank you madam
jenny is almost insouciant this time
the middle aged lady shakes her head and purses her lips
when asked if she wants to bid
sold for six hundred and fifty guineas
he brings down the gavel and a murmur goes around the room
jenny is excited and giggly
david pats her on the back
your name please
jenny looks at danny
you know who you are
to danny jenny mellor
i know who you are too
louder to auctioneer jenny mellor
couldnt have bought it without you
a nerveless performance
a beautiful large airy sitting room in the first floor flat in bedford square
the flat is unusually and tastefully decorated opulent and indicative of bohemian good taste
jenny is sipping a glass of white wine and walking around the room enthralled looking at dannys existing pre raphaelite art collection he has three or four big paintings proudly
displayed on his walls
danny is talking her through them while helen and david sitting on the sofa watch david proudly helen impassively
a couple of years ago you could pick these up for fifty quid you know
nobody was interested
i dont believe you
suddenly jenny sees a cello in the corner of the room a good one
thats not a lockey hill
there arent many people who come in here and say that
certainly not me
do you play
i used to
i vowed to myself that one day id own one of these
and now i own one and never touch it
its vulgar to put it on show really
give it to jenny
that would be even more vulgar
play for us jenny
when im good enough for it
shes good enough now
youve never heard me
danny stands up and stretches
i shall come to hear you in st johns smith square
or in oxford when you get there
we should all go and spend a weekend in oxford
straw boaters punting cream teas antiquarian bookshops
bit of business if we can find it
what about next weekend
a weekend away
i wouldnt be allowed to do that
they all look at her
ill find a way
ill talk to them
jack and marjorie
jenny hoots with derision
youre going to ask my father if i can go away with you for the weekend
hed have you arrested
ill bet you you cant do it
amused be careful jenny
you dont know who youre dealing with
half a crown
they shake hands
jenny suddenly notice the clock on dannys mantelpiece
you must take me back to school
and ive got to change back into my uniform
there is a silence
danny and david make momentary eye contact they are clearly contemplating the erotic possibilities of jennys last sentence
oh behave yourselves
jenny looks at them all mystified
jenny is in her latin class waiting for the lesson to begin
tina and hattie arent with her and she sits on her own the atmosphere of the class is very different from miss stubbs english lessons
the girls are different more serious less fun and the atmosphere is more sombre
the teacher mrs wilson is older plainer stricter
she pulls some papers out of her bag
test results for the virgil translation
we will start from the bottom
jenny puffs out her cheeks
shes not last
that would just about scrape a pass in the exam proper
not good enough for oxford candidates
jenny and her mother are sitting on the sofa staring into space clearly upset
on the coffee table in front of them is the test covered in red ink
they hear a key in the lock and they look at each other
ill talk to him
jack enters back from work
hes wearing a suit and carrying a battered briefcase
he looks at them and then notices the essay on the table
its her latin isnt it
the test didnt
well it didnt go as well as wed hoped
he picks up the paper
and you still say i shouldnt go down there and have it out with whatsername
the latin teacher
because this is hopeless
how are you going to have it out with her
what are you going to do
shout at her until she decides im much cleverer than she thinks
everyones doing their best jack
what if their best isnt good enough though eh
what do we do then
we dont go to oxford
any of us
not even you dad
perhaps its all a waste of time and money anyway
you dont mean that
well whats she going to do with an english degree
and if shes going to spend three years playing that bloody cello and talking in french to beatniks then im throwing good money after bad
i suppose she might meet a nice lawyer
but she could do that at a dinner dance tomorrow
thats the whole point of an oxford education
its the expensive alternative to a dinner dance
what about private tuition
is anyone listening to me
how much is that going to cost me
five shillings an hour
maybe a little more for a level
we could spend five bob on this and five bob on that and before we know it thats our savings down the drain
and what else are we spending five bob on
what else are we spending sixpence on
he gestures round the room
its all free
that vase was free
it was actually
it was a present from auntie vi
that chair was free
we dont have to pay for anything
and even if we did we dont have to work for it
thats the beauty of life jenny
grows on trees
wonderful isnt it
he warms to his theme and grows progressively more berserk
weve got a lovely oxford tree in the garden lucky for you so thats oxford taken care of
and a whole orchard of school trees so thats all free
im sure there are some private tuition trees out there
ill go and have a look
he stands up
no no wont take me a minute
i think i saw some at the back there right next to the pocket money tree
ill just nip out and check see that theyre doing all right
dont want anyone climbing over the wall and scrumping do we
and you never know
maybe therell be a man with deep pockets growing out there
because god knows we need to find you one
he leaves the room apparently to look in the garden for the mythical trees
jenny and her mother move to the window to watch him talking theatrically to the trees
jenny hattie and tina are walking back from school
you could always go to secretarial college with hattie
sarcastic oh thanks
hattie and tina follow jennys eyes and they see graham coming towards them pushing his bike red faced trousers tucked into socks
i havent seen you for ages
it all went wrong didnt it
the tea party i mean
was it because of the year off
ive got so much to do if im going to get the grades i need
shes got no time for boys
hattie and tina try to suppress giggles
graham turns an even brighter shade of red
hattie and tina enter the coffee bar
jenny feels sorry for him is on the verge of inviting him to join them
and changes her mind
quickly bye graham
she follows the girls inside
jenny is deep in her schoolwork
she has a latin vocabulary propped open on the window ledge
she looks at it walks away mutters to herself attempting to memorize
her concentration is broken by a sudden gale of laughter from downstairs
she stands outside the living room for a moment listening
she hears a mans voice that does not belong to her father and then more laughter from her father and mother
david is in the middle of demonstrating his ability to mimic all of the goons
jack and marjorie are laughing so hard that they can hardly see they certainly miss jennys entrance
david does the most brilliant bluebottle jenny
actually he can do all the goons
i dont think im very good at eccles
oh no youve got him
impatiently but whats he doing here
i wasnt going to disturb you
i knew youd have your nose to the grindstone
incredulous you came to see mum and dad
is that so hard to imagine
jenny spies an open bottle of wine on the coffee table
and youre drinking
but its not christmas
hark at her
makes us sound as though weve signed the pledge
you dont know everything about us you know
we had a life before you came along
yes thats true
im only going on what ive seen over the last sixteen years
im trying to think what you missed
nothing much comes to mind
they cant stand to see me enjoying myself
would you excuse me
ive got a huge pile of latin translation to do
you didnt tell me david went to oxford
jenny looks at david who stares back at her straight faced
for all the good it did me
what did you read
just like every other semi employed layabout in london
marvelling at the coincidence english
isnt that funny
i was just telling jack that im going back next weekend
i go and see my old professor every now and again
thats what you need jenny
someone on the inside track
its not always what you know is it david
and clive would love jenny
have you ever come across clive lewis
dad has never come across anyone
i just thought he might know some of the books
dad has never read any books
stung whats he written
he wrote a childrens book called the lion the witch and the wardrobe that did very well i believe
thats the clive youre talking about
well to us he was just the old codger who taught medieval literature
but i came to know him very well
got along do you know what i mean
everyone murmurs their comprehension
jenny used to love those books
that dates me
he was writing them when i was there
id love to meet him
there is a pause
jack and marjorie look at the floor
somehow david has manoeuvred a situation where effectively he is the one being asked
im being slow on the uptake
would jenny like to come with me at the weekend
well i dont know about this weekend
but one day yes thank you
how often do you see him
oh once every couple of years
but next time eh
disappointed hopefully ill be there by then
so that wont be much use
dubiously well i suppose
would she have to stay the night
well i wouldnt want to drive back after one of those oxford dinners
jack chuckles knowingly
clive will get her a room in college
thats easy enough
sounds like too good an opportunity to pass up
it would be so helpful to know something about the place
would it be a bother to you david
id be delighted
jack marjorie and jenny all beam
jenny opens the door for david
sotto voce that was scandalous
i told you
you owe me half a crown
he kisses her on the cheek and disappears into the night
david and danny are waiting for the girls to get ready
danny is sitting sprawled in an armchair david is pacing up and down
an ornate four poster bed occupies most of the space in the room
helen is doing something to jenny but we cant see what
how can they only be nearly ready
i wouldnt be surprised if three of them come out you know
thats the only explanation
theyre making themselves a friend
jenny is wearing a floaty print dress that she has borrowed from helen and there are lots of other beautiful clothes strewn about the place
jenny is sitting at the dressing table being made up by helen
jenny looks three or four years older more sophisticated
more like helen
she cant believe it
she looks in the mirror and for a moment she forgets to breathe
you can keep it
i can only wear so many every day
jenny emerges from her reverie
what about tonight
will you be needing a nightie
jenny suddenly understands what helen means
will we be sharing bedrooms
youre not sleeping with him
good for you
do you think so
youre only sixteen
and you dont want to get into the family way do you
oh id make sure that didnt happen
im going to do it when im seventeen
on my seventeenth birthday hopefully
i suppose it will be with david wont it
whens your birthday
oh hell be around in april
if thats what you want
ill find you a nightie
jenny stares at herself in the mirror again
the girls emerge
both men are entranced by jennys transformation
david cant take his eyes off her
thoughtful shall we ah
make a move
he gets to his feet
the bristol on the country road to oxford
the bristol drives through oxford
jenny catches a quick glimpse of a dreaming spire
imagine spending three years here
she shudders as if someone has walked over her grave
can we stop
there are a couple of things we have to do
jenny and helen in the back seat of the car which is parked outside a house in the back streets of oxford
theres no sign of danny and david
jenny sighs impatiently
oh its always like this
there are millions of places ive never seen because ive been stuck in here
you never get out
theres never anywhere to go in the places they stop
jenny looks out of the window
this is self evidently true
helen and danny jenny and david are standing in a quiet old fashioned pub warming themselves at an open fire
david has a pen in his hand and hes holding a book the lion the witch and the wardrobe
is he clive do you think
im confused now
i thought youd made him up
attempting briefly to be patient no we
david walks over to the nearest table and writes in the book
he stands up hands the book to jenny
reads to dear jenny
with the pleasure of meeting you
come and see me again soon
dirty old man
he takes a long drink from his pint of bitter
a group of students enter all carrying musical instruments
they stand at the bar waiting to be served
jenny stares at them with longing she wants to be one of them
helen meanwhile stares at them as if they were aliens
sotto voce why are university girls so strange looking
the girls in the group are all bespectacled and frumpy
the others laugh
and they cant all have started off that way can they
most girls arent ugly but most girl students are
so there must be something about those places that you know makes you fat or spotty or short sighted
well if you look at it that way
i mean thats proper scientific analysis
and you cant argue with science
helen looks pleased
im still not quite clear on what you want to do when you get here
i want to read english
you want to read english books
reading english is just another way of saying
i wouldnt worry jenny
youre wasting your breath
anyway tomorrow well try to get more of a feel for the place
this would be a good place to do a little business
david catches jennys eye
this isnt what he meant by getting a feel for the place
all those little old ladies wandering around
ill bet this place is rife with stats
please explain what stats are
youre always going on about them
think of a number
now think about the most boring lesson youve ever had at school
now double it
now multiply it by the number you first thought of and there you are
thats the official boredom content of stats
a rather grotty and certainly unromantic b b bedroom so unromantic in fact that it even has the same fusty curtains from jennys sitting room
david is in bed his hands behind his head waiting for jenny
as far as we can tell hes wrapped up in the sheets quite tightly hes in his underwear
the bedroom is lit unromantically by the watt overhead light
jenny comes into the room wearing one of helens nightdresses a glamorous satiny item quite inappropriate for the occasion or the surroundings
she looks nervous
weve got exactly the same curtains at home
lets not talk about curtains
you look beautiful
you really are a princess
jenny was about to get into bed but his tone makes her pause at the edge of the bed
theres something you should know david
well im a virgin
and i want to stay that way until im seventeen
i think thats good
i think thats right
and for your seventeenth birthday im going to take you to paris or rome or florence and make you feel like the most beautiful princess in the kingdom of love
but we can still be romantic cant we
of course we can
if it doesnt mean
is that me
youre my minnie mouse and im your bubbalub
if thats what
would you mind if i had a look at what might one day be mine
just a peek
his eyes stray to her breasts
jenny stares at him
you just want to see them
i just want to see them
jenny flustered and nervous looks at her nightgown she doesnt know what to do
let it fall from your shoulders
she does so
he sits up and lovingly lifts the straps back up
he smiles at her
relieved she smiles back
the bristol containing david and jenny in the front seats and danny and helen in the back passing through a pretty oxfordshire village
it pulls up outside a country cottage with a for sale sign outside
might be worth a look
the four get out of the car and jenny follows david and danny to the front door of the house
helen hangs back
jenny turns around
arent you coming
we dont go in
what are you talking about
helen will look after you
go and find a nice cup of tea somewhere
jenny is mystified
i dont need looking after thank you very much
david i want to see
david ignores her
im not going to tell you a second time
helen and jenny waiting for the boys
helen is blithe chatty jenny has a face like thunder
they wont be long
sometimes they find something sometimes they dont
in the distance david is waving at them urgently
and when they do find something we usually have to leave quite quickly
they can be a bit naughty sometimes
its nice to have company
im usually outside on my own
jenny stares at helen
shes beginning to realise who she is dealing with
an old picture of some kind is wedged between helen and jenny on the back seat
jenny furious is staring out of the window
helen attempts to peer around the partition but settles for a wave
jenny doesnt respond
sorry about being a little brisk back there jenny
we have our way of doing things
still no response
oh come on jenny
lets not spoil things
im spoiling things
i think there must be some kind of misunderstanding
jenny shakes her head bitterly
they continue driving in silence
the bristol pulls up outside dannys bedford square flat
who wants to come up for a drink
still furious no thanks
ill find my own way home
jenny gets out of the car and starts up the road
david gets out and starts to chase after her
he catches up with her in the street
it was an old map
it was cooped up in that miserable little cottage and she didnt even know what it was
what a waste
it shouldnt spend its life on a wall in wherever the hell we are
it should be with us
we know how to look after it properly
we liberated it
jenny snorts derisively
thats one word for it
quickly and passionately oh dont be bourgeois jenny
youre better than that
i know you have fun with us
i can see it
you drink everything i put in front of you down in one every last drop and then you slam your glass down on the bar and ask for more and
were not clever like you so we have to be clever in other ways because if we werent there would be no fun
we have to be clever with maps and
you want to know what stats are
stats are old ladies who are scared of coloured people
so i move the coloureds in and the old ladies move out and i buy their flats cheap
thats what i do
so now you know
jenny nods reluctantly
and if you dont like it then i will understand and you can go back to twickenham and listen to the home service and do your latin homework
but these weekends and the restaurants and the concerts
they dont grow on trees
jenny looks at him startled
do you understand
of course you do
this is who we are jenny
he turns to face her and holds out his hand
on jenny is she in or out
jenny takes his hand
david pulls her towards him holds her around the waist and begins to dance with her
further up the pavement helen and danny watch laughing
david pulls up in the bristol outside jennys house and they sit in the dark for a little while
i suppose you have homework to do
beat thank you
i had a nice time
surprised despite his speech earlier really
in spite of the the incident
with the map
as you said in the car it was a misunderstanding
you have no idea how boring everything was before i met you
i hope that theres something more than excitement to our relationship
excitements a lot when youre at school and you live in twickenham
you know what im trying to say
i want you to like me for who i am not just what i can do for you
but that is who you are
ive never met anyone like you
action is character our english teacher says
what does that mean
i think it means that if we never did anything we wouldnt be anybody
and i never did anything before i met you
and sometimes i think no ones ever done anything in this stupid country apart from you
thats a good place to end the weekend
ill give you a tinkle
they look at each other
david is clearly smitten
he moves towards her
he wants to kiss her but he doesnt want to frighten her in the end jenny makes it easy for him and moves towards him
they kiss gently and tenderly
flustered jenny breaks it off gets out of the car and goes inside while david watches
jenny enters the sitting room with her overnight bag to find the radio on her father reading the paper and her mother knitting
when jenny comes in jack beams
he has clearly turned some kind of corner
here she is
the wanderer returns
did you have a nice time
lovely thank you
was he nice to you
jenny unzips her bag and pulls out her copy of the book
she hands it to her father
jack examines the inscription
well i never
look at this marjorie
he hands it to her
she examines it reverently
what was he like
he was just
and did he show you round
oh he was busy
david did though
what did you think
did it make you want to work harder
never a dull moment with david is there
if its not concerts its famous authors
bit different from that lad you brought home for tea isnt he
davids a lot older than graham
graham could live to be two hundred and he still wouldnt be swanning around with famous authors
hasnt got it in him
he might become a famous author for all you know
being one isnt the same as knowing one is it
anyone can be one
but if you move in those circles
well it says something about you doesnt it
it says youre going places
it says youre well connected
hes an impressive young man that david
i like him more and more
well they say opposites attract dont they
i wouldnt have thought he was your sort
and now he is
is that how you feel jenny
i feel i should do my homework
she leaves the room
marjorie watches her go thoughtfully
a group of girls cross country running
jenny and her friends are at the back of the group and the gym teacher jogging backwards gesticulates at them to get a move on
christmas is coming
they put on enough of a spurt to satisfy her and then immediately stop when the teacher is no longer watching
seeing an attractive bench they sit down
from somewhere under a skirt jenny produces a packet of exotic looking cigarettes and offers them around
what the hell are those
hattie and tina make snooty faces
jenny takes a cigarette
the others follow suit
jenny lights them and they all grimace
the contrast between the sophisticated cigarettes and the unsophisticated smokers and context is pronounced
where did they come from
she might have bought them from the savoy or claridges or the opera or some fancy nightclub
who knows with jenny
you cant buy them here
suddenly looking at her suspiciously you never bought them yourself
mimicking tinas grammar cruelly no
shut up you stuck up cow
but ill bring you some back if you want
hes taking you to paris
smiling smugly oui
isnt it your birthday next tuesday
the two friends shriek and jump up and down
oh my god
i wouldnt like to be you
all those dinners youve had off him
you have such a victorian attitude to sex you two
oh sorry dr kinsey
were not all as experienced as you
i mean youve done it
she counts on her fingers i make it never
can that be right
but your parents are just going to let you swan off like that
they dont know yet
davids got a plan he says
he usually has something up his sleeve
ive noticed that
what did he tell them when you had your weekend in oxford
animated by the memory oh it was
she changes her mind david went to oxford
and he offered to show me round
so you have a good looking boyfriend with pots of money brains and a nice car
apparently i do
tina makes a bitter face
and they tell us theres a god
jenny glances off into the distance and spots a portly middle aged woman heading in their direction
they stand up grind their sobranies into the mud kick them under the bench and set off at a brisk trot
the sobranie stubs come to rest near a pile of dog poo
breakfast on jennys birthday
jenny is at the table buttering toast
jack is reading the paper marjorie is cooking him eggs and bacon
is david taking you somewhere special tonight
not that i know of
ive asked graham round for tea and birthday cake
what do we want him round for
i happened to be talking to his mother about something and
what did you happen to be talking to her about
i thought it would be nice
what if david turns up
are we expecting david to turn up
it might not be a bad thing if he did
well if you think about it theres more than one way of skinning a cat
and whos the skinned cat in this enchanting image
no of course
i have an education to pursue
graham jenny and her father are at the dinner table sitting in the dark
marjorie kicks the door open with her foot and comes in holding a birthday cake with seventeen candles burning on it
she puts it down carefully on the table
blow them out then before the whole place burns down
jenny closes her eyes makes her wish blows out her candles
her father and mother both look at her apparently attempting to read her mind
jack gets up to turn the lights on
we can see that by jennys side are two unopened carefully wrapped presents both exactly the same size clearly books
whod like a piece
in truth the cake is a rather sorry and unappetising specimen
there isnt enough icing on the top
she cuts a couple of slices which immediately collapse
ill have one of those
without any real enthusiasm jenny opens the first one of the two from her mum and dad
its a latin dictionary
i needed a new one
crestfallen oh dear
the doorbell rings
jenny perks up
jack goes to answer it and immediately the house is energised its david
jack answers the door to david
you wont believe this jenny
did you leave anything in the shop
you can hardly see him for all the parcels and flowers hes carrying
its a special day
he and jenny exchange a glance
jack comes in behind him
shes a special girl
oh i know it
to graham hello young man
this is graham
graham a pleasure
they shake hands
graham suddenly looks five years younger
makes your dictionary look a bit feeble eh graham
graham looks pained
and ours too come to that
well were not the ones trying to impress her
david what can i get you to drink
whats everybody else having
what have you got there graham
ive given him a glass of pop
stung id better be going i have a stack of homework to do
graham says his goodbyes
he tries to catch jennys eye but she looks away
marjorie shows him to the door
you can put the pop away now
what is there for the grown ups
a glass of something warming
you know me so well
hearty laughter from the two men
can i open anything yet
marjorie comes back into the room
wait for me
before you start on that little lot i have a surprise
next weekend were all going to chez georges to celebrate jennys birthday
chez georges is in the boulevard st germain
jenny giggles her delight
jacks smile is a little more forced
how dyou mean paris
you know the one dad
panic rising but
we havent got any french money
and im not sure
i just dont think it would agree with me
they dont like us the french you know
john sutton at work went once
they were very rude to him
im not sure id like that
jenny understands davids ploy perfectly and the role she must play
her eyes fill with tears
i dont want to spoil anyones fun but
its not for me europe
well go another time
bitterly youve just said you dont like europe
whats going to change
itll have to be europe wont it
because it isnt going to be you
i can take her
genuinely indignant to france
and leave me here on my own
oh for gods sake
jack looks cornered
he needs to find a way out
listen im really sorry to have caused all this to do
i just thought it might be nice
but ill go with aunt helen and uncle daniel
they can have your tickets
jack looks at him
the one who went to the concert with you
yes thats the one
relieved well there we are
perplexed where are we
dont you see
if aunt helens going to be there
the penny apparently dropping of course
i didnt want to put a spoke in anyones wheels
but if you look at it from my angle
a bachelor taking my daughter off to paris
i hadnt thought it through properly
i do apologise jack
would you prefer it if helen took jenny on her own
i dont mind
ive been to paris before
oh i couldnt possibly ask
if aunt helens going
he smiles broadly
hes off the hook
jenny catches davids eye and smiles
hattie tina and jenny are sitting on their desks waiting for a lesson to start
hattie shows jenny a piece of paper which apparently contains some kind of shopping list
there are some things you must buy for us and some things you only have to buy for us if youre a proper true friend
she points at hattie then at herself
chanel perfume chanel perfume
she repeats the gesture chanel lipstick chanel lipstick
what have i forgotten
those funny cigarettes you were smoking
ten packets each
a very small girl twelve or thirteen comes in to the classroom and approaches jenny
are you the girl going to paris
tina hattie and jenny stare at her
well are you or arent you
because id like some perfume
miss stubbs comes into the classroom carrying books and essays
she sees the small girl and shoos her out
she then approaches jenny and whispers discreetly into her ear
jenny the headmistress would like a word at the end of the lesson
im afraid that the legend of mr rochester may have travelled further than you intended
jenny looks at her startled and a little sick
the office is dark wood panelled foreboding apparently designed to put all visitors ill at ease
the headmistress would probably choose to be wood panelled if she could
shes tweedy bespectacled severe
there is a knock at the door
she doesnt look up from her paperwork
jenny enters looking young and frightened
jenny tries to look back at her with all the courage she can muster
were all very excited about your forthcoming trip to paris
our excitement indeed knows no bounds
some of us can talk of little else
jenny looks at her feet
an older man i understand
a word of warning miss mellor
there may well have been the odd sixth form girl who has lost an important part of herself perhaps the best part while under our supervision
these things happen regrettably
if however we are made aware of this loss then of course the young lady in question would have to continue her studies elsewhere if she still has any use
for a levels
is that clear
can i go now
jenny turns round and walks out without saying another word
through the window of a hotel suite we see a bea jet soaring into the sky
david and jenny arent on it though
they are letting themselves into the room
jenny stares at the featureless sitting room
theres no bed
i pushed the boat out and got us a suite
well if work stops us getting to paris until tomorrow then work can buy us a nice hotel room
anyway its a special occasion isnt it
i would have thought that tonight of all nights we only need a bedroom
close on davids reaction she hasnt forgotten that tonights the night
david and jenny in bed in a dimly lit bedroom
they are kissing david more passionately than jenny
he is making little whimpers of excitement and jenny is clearly trying hard to hide her nerves
were acutely aware of her age and of her virginity
suddenly david breaks off
hold on a second
ive got something
rather absurdly he half disappears over the side of the bed reaching for something on the floor
he comes back with a banana
jenny stares at him
what on earth is that for
i thought we might want to practice
jenny shrieks with horror
with a banana
i thought wed get the messy bit over with first
david i dont want to lose my virginity to a piece of fruit
david attempts to kiss her again
jenny wriggles clear
lets wait until we get to paris
i think the moment might have gone
im sorry minnie
im such a fool
jenny doesnt deny it
if tomorrow night does happen it will never happen again so
alarmed why wont it ever happen again
because the first time can only happen once
no baby talk
im not old enough for baby talk
treat me like a grown up
david looks chastened
brightly i know
lets go and sit in our sitting room
cheered up hooray
ill order some champagne
jenny looks at him with what might from one angle be construed as fondness
juliette greco on the soundtrack
jenny leans against a wall the seine and notre dame behind her
david takes her picture
she looks fantastic in the clothes david has given her for her birthday
a crowded left bank gallery
jenny is sitting on the floor watching an impossibly handsome young frenchman paint black the body of an impressively passive naked woman
the young man sitting next to jenny gives her an appraising look
david standing at the back and looking square and uncomfortable notices
we see three listening booths all containing customers
jenny and david are in the middle booth listening to the juliette greco song on the soundtrack
for a moment the sound quality changes soundtrack becomes source music seamlessly
jenny is studying the sleeve
she wants to hug herself shes so excited
a left bank cafe david and jenny are eating steak frites outside drinking vin ordinaire watching the world go by
they are both anticipating the night ahead
jenny is smoking at the second floor window of a simple pretty parisian hotel wearing a glamorous looking slip and looking at the street life below her
the bedroom is simple and romantic everything the airport hotel wasnt
david is lying amid rumpled sheets smoking what is clearly a post coital cigarette and watching jenny from behind
do you still feel like a schoolgirl
jenny turns round smiles shakes her head
and it wasnt too uncomfortable
not after the
its funny though isnt it
all that poetry and all those songs and films about something that lasts no time at all
david looks at her
she isnt being cruel
she just doesnt know any different
she returns to her people watching
he smokes ruminatively
jenny in her games kit smoking her sobranie with her friends on the park bench again
hattie and tina are examining their bottles of chanel reverently
jenny is back to being her seventeen year old self somehow her seventeen year old self looks comical and no longer appropriate
how can you go back to double french when youve had a weekend with an older man in a posh hotel in paris
you wouldnt catch me coming anywhere near this dump
artfully it wasnt all glamour
we spent half the weekend at heathrow in a hotel suite
oh my god
they smoke their sobranies ruminatively
youre going to miss it
all the swanning around in posh hotels
why will i need to miss it
when you go to oxford
unless youre planning on being with david forever
jenny doesnt say anything
youre not are you
distracted god no
wont you miss it
clearly she will and clearly she hasnt thought about it before
well miss it
jennys english class file past miss stubbs at the end of a lesson
miss stubbs stops jenny
jenny could i have a word
to hattie and tina ill catch you up
miss stubbs waits until the room empties
you can do anything you want jenny
you know that
youre clever and youre pretty
but sometimes those things fight
im worried that at the moment clever jenny and pretty jenny are fighting
what do you mean
i couldnt bear it if clever jenny lost
its because of people like you that i plough through illiterate essays by sandra lovell about her pony
and there arent many of you i can tell you
one every few years
is your boyfriend interested in clever jenny
i think so
interested enough to let her do what she wants
he couldnt stop me
he might not have to stop you
thats what im trying to tell you
frustrated im not sure what youre trying to tell me
im telling you to go to oxford
no matter what
or youll break my heart
jenny looks at her
quietly where did you go
louder bolder where did you go
what does that mean
and youre pretty
so presumably clever miss stubbs won
and here you are reading all those pony essays
i dont know
these last few months ive been to paris and to jazz clubs and ive eaten in wonderful restaurants and seen wonderful films heard beautiful music
im sure you have
but i was filled up with beautiful things books and music and conversation in exactly the same way at cambridge
and i didnt have to pay the same sort of price
are you taking precautions jenny
jenny stares at her angrily
its nothing to do with that
maybe our lives are always going to end up with pony essays
and yes maybe well go up to oxford
but if were all going to die the moment we graduate maybe its what we do before that counts
im sorry you think im dead
i dont think youre dead
coldly youd better get to your next class
she turns her back on jenny
helen danny jenny get out of davids bristol which is parked outside a nightclub called esmereldas barn
david has parked next to a white rolls royce
looking at the rolls royce and we know the person who owns this
danny and david laugh
hes a business acquaintance and we need to talk to him
i gathered that much
but why do we have to crawl around the west end looking for his car
why dont you just make an appointment if you want to see him
the men snigger
ring his office
talk to his secretary
that isnt how it works with him dear
the four walk in and take their coats over to the cloakroom
the club is a smoky west end club full of smartly dressed and dubious looking men and young glamorous dubious looking women
jenny and helen look out of place helen too ethereal jenny too innocent
there is jazz playing
there he is
we see a nasty looking man in his late s early s
he is wearing a white sharksin suit and smoking a big cigar
hes standing by the roulette table talking to an even nastier looking man in a dark suit
they find a table at the back and sit down
a waitress comes over to their table
a bottle of champagne please
he looks at jenny and david expectantly
dont be bashful
everyone ignores her
all right then
if you wont tell them i will
jenny got two as and a b in her mock a levels
the b was in latin
but its much better than it was isnt it minnie
rachman is now standing on his own
danny nudges david and they go over to talk to him just as the champagne arrives
the waiter pops the bottle of champagne and pours two glasses
the girls smile and clink glasses
someone told me that in fifty years no one will speak latin probably
not even latin people
so you shouldnt mind too much about your b
jenny stares at her trying to think of a response
danny and david are at the bar having just finished talking to rachman
danny puffs out his cheeks and shakes his head
well im not sure youd want him to marry your sister
im not even sure youd want to talk to him in a night club come to that
they both chuckle
there is a silence for a moment
gently you do know what youre doing old chap
this is the one danny
weve heard that before
you can see shes different
shes got everything
youve got helen and
drily and youve got helen with brains
i dont want to see her hurt
they make their way back to their table
while david and helen watch danny and jenny dance
dannys a good dancer jenny is nervous at first but becomes more comfortable and more expressive with dannys help
knowing that she should make conversation as all the couples around her are doing have you
have you bought any more paintings recently
oh i picked up a little piper the other day
a good un i think
im still trying to work out what makes good things good
its hard isnt it
the thing is jenny you know without necessarily being able to explain why
youve got taste
thats not even half the battle
thats the whole war
jenny smiles at him with gratitude
there is a sudden closeness between them
david is watching them carefully
they return to their table
jenny we should go
one day school will be over forever and we can talk about art all night
to danny youre all right in a taxi arent you
he guides jenny firmly out of the club
jenny is about to to open the passenger door of the bristol but david stops her
he runs to the back of the car opens the boot and starts rummaging through it
it seems to be full of everything but the thing hes looking for
what are you doing
he slams the boot shut and comes back empty handed
will you marry me
jenny stares at him for a moment then laughs
what were you looking for
i thought i had a ring
it wouldnt have been the right one
but it would have done for tonight
eyes twinkling with amusement oh david
youre very sweet
what do you think
helplessly please take me home
she gets into the car
we see the desperation in davids face lit by the headlights of a passing taxi as he slams the door on jenny after shes got in
jenny tina and hattie all smoking in the school toilets
jenny is distracted and standing apart from the others
tina looks at her
how do you say a penny for your thoughts
a franc is too much isnt it
for her thoughts yes
youd be overpaying by about ninety nine centimes
suddenly the door bursts open and the latin teacher comes in
the three girls are lined up in front of the headmistress hands by their sides
im surprised that you two are standing in front of me
im not surprised to find you here miss mellor though i do feel rather like the judge who sent al capone to prison for tax evasion
we take a very dim view of smoking
we take an even dimmer view of some of your other behaviour which as far as we know has taken place off school premises
your appearance here today however allows me to remind you that we are trying to teach you how to become young ladies not nightclub hostesses
in reality of course you are neither
you are merely silly little girls
detention after school
jennys face sets hard
something in her shuts down
jenny is smoking on the balcony
jenny is at her desk in her bedroom trying to work but she cant concentrate
her hair is tied back in a pony tail
she gets up pulls back the curtains looks out of the window
we see what she sees a sleepy suburban street at night
she looks back at her desk
it looks even more boring than the street
she looks at her scrubbed seventeen year old face in the mirror so much younger than the jenny we have seen with david
she makes herself up and she gets older and more glamorous before our eyes
in her make up and her school uniform shes half woman half child
we hear the noises drifting up from the kitchen the radio the washing up occasional muffled conversation
jenny walks out of the bedroom and slips downstairs
jennys mother and father are doing the washing up and listening to the radio
they have their backs to the door
jenny enters the room quietly and watches them for a moment they do need some looking after but nothing that will require too much work
just leave them in your potting shed for a couple of weeks and theyll look after themselves
the potting shed
who does he think i am
prince rainier of monaco
what if i got married instead of going to college
jack and marjorie turn around and stare at this strange apparition wearing too much make up and a school uniform
it would depend who it was surely
course it would
i wouldnt want you married off just for the sake of it
has somebody asked you
marjorie rolls her eyes
what did you tell him
a man i just met walking his dog
davids asked you to marry him
pardon my french
do you have any choice
or is it too late
she looks at her daughter knowingly
jack merely looks confused
of course shes got a choice
but its an interesting one isnt it
this is where youre supposed to say but what about oxford
looked at it one way you wouldnt really need to go now would you
hes a man going places
and say what you like but they know how to take care of their money dont they
hell see youre looked after
quietly turning the words over in her mouth i wouldnt need to go
would you like to expand on that
you know what i mean
jenny laughs bitterly
she cant believe it
all that latin
all those essays
what was the point
why didnt you just send me out prowling round nightclubs
it would have been less trouble
and i might have had more fun
we dont know about nightclubs
we knew about education
anyway it all turned out for the best
he wouldnt have wanted you if you were thick would he
jenny stares at them and walks out
miss stubbs is standing at the front of the class holding a copy of king lear and listening as various members of the class massacre the text
some are messing about by overacting others read to the best of their ability tonelessly and with no understanding of the words
lear himself is being read by ann the bespectacled girl from the first scene
shes no king lear and shes one of the bad readers
may not an ass know when the cart draws the horse
sings whoop jug i love thee
yes when it says sings it means he sings those words
girl looks at her blankly
does any here know me
this is not lear
does lear walk thus
sotto voce to jenny in the seat next to her no
jenny starts to giggle
tina shakes her head
where are his eyes
tina doesnt need to say anything she just looks at jenny makes a pair of spectacles with her fingers and squints
jennys giggling fit increases in intensity
either his notion weakens or his discernings are lethargied
tis not so
who is it that can tell me who i am
jennys arm shoots up as if to answer the question
miss stubbs looks at jenny more in sorrow than in anger jennys behaviour now is something new in their relationship
jenny stares back at her defiantly
suddenly miss stubbs notices something glinting on her hand an engagement ring
she is as she promised she would be heartbroken
take it off
hattie who is sitting behind jenny notices the ring too for the first time
oh my god
is that really what i think it is
im going to be a there is an excited susurration in the classroom
you know theres a school rule about jewelry
half the girls in this room are wearing jewelry
but none of it is going to ruin their lives
coolly we have a difference of opinion on that
miss stubbs stares at her
jenny can only just steel herself to stare back
lets see whos right
come with me
jenny doesnt move
please dont make me drag you out like a child
jenny gets to her feet
teacher and pupil leave the room while the rest of the class watches
how far advanced are these ridiculous plans
have you set a date
have you decided on a church
we wont be getting married in a church
the headmistress stares at her dumbfounded
hes a jew
youre aware i take it that the jews killed our lord
beginning to feel less intimidated by her surroundings and youre aware i suppose that our lord was jewish
the headmistress snorts scornfully i suppose he told you that
were all very sorry about what happened in the war
but theres no excuse for that sort of malicious and untruthful propaganda
jenny smiles to herself
anyway i can now see that you are even more in need of responsible advice than i realised
is it true that you dont intend to sit for your exams
and therefore you wont be applying for university
yes thats right
what do you think youre doing
nobody has been able to explain to me the point of university
therefore i dont see the point of the exams either
nobody does anything worth doing without a degree
and nobody does anything worth doing with one either
no woman anyway
so what i do isnt worth doing
or what miss stubbs does or mrs wilson or any of us here
jenny doesnt say anything
the headmistress takes her silence as an admission of defeat
because none of us would be here without our degrees you realise that dont you
and yes of course studying is hard and boring and
jenny cant contain herself any longer
studying is hard and boring
teaching is hard and boring
so youre telling me to be bored and then bored and then finally bored again this time for the rest of my life
this whole stupid country is bored
theres no life in it or colour in it or fun in it
its probably just as well that the russians are going to drop a nuclear bomb on us any day now
so my choice is either to do something hard and boring or to marry my
my jew and go to paris and rome and listen to jazz and read and eat good food in nice restaurants and have fun
its not enough to educate us any more mrs walters
youve got to tell us why youre doing it
because without formal qualifications
she grinds to a halt
she has never had to answer this question before
it doesnt have to be teaching you know
theres the civil service
jenny stands up
i dont wish to be impertinent mrs walters
but it is an argument worth rehearsing
you never know
someone else might want to know what the point of it all is one day
she leaves the office
jenny is half walking half running towards the school gates
shes scared of course but exhilarated too
all that pressure and all those years of education suddenly over unexpectedly and certainly unceremoniously
she looks neither left nor right but other girls younger girls watch her through the windows as she leaves
jenny doesnt even look round when she goes through the school gates
jenny and marjorie are sitting at the kitchen table
jack is standing over them he hasnt even taken his coat off or put his briefcase down
how dyou mean left
jenny doesnt answer
what about your exams
im not sitting them
what are we going to tell people
witheringly oh telling people
id forgotten that what we tell people is more important than anything
marjorie knows what hes going to say and doesnt want him to
no need for jack
she should hear it
all that money
do you know how much its cost me for you to go through school and take no exams
im sure david will pay you back
send him a bill
as you said he wouldnt have wanted me if i was dim so he should fork out
just tell me why theres a point in sitting my exams and theres no point in me going to university
jack gapes at her
you know what your trouble is dont you
youre too clever by half
in which case i should have left school years ago shouldnt i
ask them for the money back
if im too clever by half you overpaid by a third
danny helen david and jenny are in dannys flat we have just missed the announcement there is champagne already open
danny glances quickly and discreetly at david who catches his eye
thats fantastic news
danny isnt so pleased
there is much chinking of glasses
i thought youd see sense about university
youll stay pretty now
laughter from david and jenny
am i still allowed to read
you wont be laughing when she goes all speccy and spotty david
helen is bemused by their mirth
danny watches david thoughtfully
david and jenny come out of dannys flat and approach davids car
danny didnt seem very pleased about our engagement
i thought that too
i was wondering whether he might be a bit jealous
trying not to be pleased jealous
you may have noticed that helens not really oxford material
im going to keep him out of your way
they both smile
david opens the door for jenny and she gets into the car
jenny is making david a cup of tea
her mother is keeping an eye on jenny in marjories mind at least this is a rehearsal for something
i havent put my
my stamp on it yet
havent had time
it needs a womans touch really
and if you dont like it we can move
just say the word
where is the flat again
you have to put the cosy on straight away
jenny sighs and rolls her eyes
she picks up the hand knitted tea cosy and puts it on her head
on the tea pot
she puts the tea cosy on the tea pot
just down from russell square
two minutes walk from the underground
we could walk to
she tries to think of somewhere jenny might find interesting
we could walk to the british museum
jenny gives her a look
ill leave you to it
dont let it stew
she leaves the room
and this is where youre living
ive stayed there for the last couple of nights
beat on and off
youve stayed there two nights on and off
is that tea ready
one sugar please
frustrated by his evasions david
you must think im very odd
you seem to float around
i never know where you are
she hands him his tea
a wandering jew
he pauses to take a sip
if i tell you something will you promise not to laugh
it depends on how funny it is
mumbling i live at home
we all live at home
i live at home
in the same way that you live at home
but i live with my mother and fa
you dont mean it
david nods shamefacedly
your mother and father
just my mother
my fathers dead
ive been meaning to tell you minnie and it would have been much better than all those silly lies
he looks quite upset
we warm to him
jenny leans over and takes his hand
you can see how much i need you
and you wont regret this i promise
well have so much fun
and just think
when we get married you wont have to wait in the car while i do my business
youll be waiting at home looking at the burne jones on the wall
can you imagine
close on jenny
she cant imagine really
jenny tina and hattie in the coffee bar
jenny is eagerly scanning the english literature exam paper
did you do this one
show from any two scenes in pride and prejudice how far it is true that jane austens methods are essentially dramatic
it says two here
she shows the paper to hattie
hattie slumps onto the formica table and groans
i cant believe it
tina rubs hatties head sympathetically
it was an unfair question
youre hopeless at maths
what do you do all day anyway lady muck
ive been looking at flats
ive been to look at dresses
ive been reading a lot too
reading trying on dresses
where did we go wrong
whats this afternoon
the translation paper
jenny is lapping it all up
she might even be envious
jenny and marjorie are in the sitting room all dressed up and waiting for david to come and pick them up
jenny looks great as usual her mother looks smart if somewhat old fashioned
hell find a nice place in no time
he sees plenty of them
im not sure he sees plenty of nice places
would you like a radiogram for a wedding present
we love ours
something about this depresses jenny
you wont be bored you know
hes not boring
now they are both thoughtful
as if on cue jack comes into the sitting room pulling at his tie looking apprehensive
he appears to be wearing brylcreem
he looks like a little boy who has been made to put on his sunday best
what sort of things can you have for starters
i mean how will i know what are starters and what arent
im all right if its soup or fruit juice
but if its anything more than that
weve been through this dad
itll be quite clearly marked on the menu
the doorbell rings
jenny goes to answer the door
why dont you three go out
ill be happy here with a tin of
david enters the room
he is relaxed happy
he has worn a tie possibly because he knew that jack would wear a tie
jack and marjorie stand and they exchange greetings
i think youll like this place jack
their wine list is as good as anything ive seen in london
someone told me that
who else would it have been
jack and marjorie approach davids bristol
i was hoping youd take us in this
oh you wont want to go in anything else after tonight
mind you it drinks petrol
im afraid well have to stop on the way in to town
he opens the back door for his future in laws
they get in he closes the door runs round to open the front passenger door for jenny
david starts the car and glances in the rear view mirror
i feel like eamonn andrews
is that a good thing
eamonn andrews is the poshest person that jack can imagine being
the bristol cruises down a london arterial road
we see from davids pov a petrol station approaching
sorry about this
he slows the car and turns in to the garage
david gets out of the car as the attendant comes over
how can i help you sir
you might as well fill her up
david looks around and spots a phone box just outside the garage
he leans in through the open car window
im just going to make a quick call
ill be two ticks
jenny watches him walk towards the phone box
do you think we should offer him some petrol money
or would he feel insulted
jenny watches david as he dials the number
he notices her waves puts the money in the slot
hed feel insulted probably
he said tonight was his treat
that must include the petrol for gods sakes
david starts to talk and turns away as if hes frightened that someone in the car can lip read
what do you think
nobody pays him any attention
they lapse into silence
jack starts to fiddle with the features in the car a table springs down from the seat in front of him much to his alarm
what have i done
jenny opens the glove compartment looking for the cigarettes that david always keeps there
she finds the cigarettes and closes the glove compartment
but she has seen something in there so she opens it again
she takes out some letters and papers and starts to look through them
david has finished his phone call and is walking towards the car
he sees jenny looking through letters and papers sees the open glove compartment starts to run across the forecourt
its too late
we see jennys stricken face gleaming in someone elses headlights
david gets into the car
as cold as ice take us home
whats going on
theres been a
jennys had a bit of a shock
jenny laughs mirthlessly then starts to weep
its another one of davids little muddles and misunderstandings
jenny its not
i dont want to hear another word from anybody
take me home
marjorie and jack look at each other
david swings the car around and they drive home in silence jenny cries constantly without making a sound
the bristol draws up outside jennys house
david jumps out of the car and lets marjorie and jack out
jack starts to walk towards the house and then stops
desperately you can sort this out cant you david
jenny gets out of the car too
of course i can
shes just got the wrong end of the stick about something
go inside dad
jenny and david watch jack and marjorie go into the house
the moment the door is closed jenny walks towards david
shes holding a bunch of letters that she took out of the glove compartment
she starts to throw them at him one by one
mr and mrs david goldman mr and mrs david goldman mr and mrs david goldman mr and mrs david goldman
when she has thrown the last one she flies at david she slaps him punches him scratches him
david tries to grab her hands but shes too wild
just let me
legally yes but
finally he manages to subdue her
she leans against the car distraught
when were you going to tell me
it just it never seemed the right time
you seemed so happy and i was happy and
it would have spoiled everything
what can i do minnie
what can i do
im just too busy to find somewhere to live
i live with my mummy
you were living with your wife
all this time
whats your address
david gestures vaguely
its no wonder we kept bumping into each other then is it
theres no point
jenny picks one of the envelopes up off the ground and looks at it
bitterly sarcastic good grief
its the truth
you have to understand
i was with you just about all the spare time i had
i cant tell you how grateful i am
dont be like this
i have nothing
i left school
i didnt take my exams
wheres it all gone now
i gave my life away
jenny i can get a divorce
everything will turn out for the best
we can see jack and marjorie peering through the lace curtains anxiously
go and tell them
go and tell them then go and tell your wife
i want to see you
i want to stand there and watch
david stands on the pavement looking towards the house
he looks away he cant make eye contact with jennys parents
theyre not going to listen to me now
let me come round tomorrow
when everyones calmed down a bit
suddenly desperate please dont leave me to tell them on my own
you owe me that much
you owe them that much
sadly i owe them a lot more than that
i owe them everything
they gave me you
he opens the boot
its full of cases of whiskey
jenny doesnt even bother asking what they are doing there
david takes one of the bottles opens it takes a long slug
and then ill come out and drag you in
jenny marches into the house and slams the door
the camera stays on david
he gets back into the car and takes another slug of whiskey
then his shoulders begin to shake and he cries and cries
jenny comes in leaving the door open for david
her parents are standing in the sitting room looking at her anxiously
their coats are still on and they havent put the lights on yet
whats going on
hes helping himself to some dutch courage before facing you
stolen dutch courage from the look of it
he has something to tell you
she stands pale and young looking again opposite her parents
suddenly they are all three lit up by headlights
shot from their pov of the bristol roaring off up the street
he just drove off
we close slowly in on jennys face
but of course hed drive off
pathetic can you tell us
jenny cant deal with her own pain let alone his
he already looks like a broken foolish old man
they should hug
but they dont
a suburban street full of semi detached houses not far from jennys house
jenny walks down the road tentatively shes looking at the numbers on the houses
she looks young again tired no make up no elegant clothes
she cant bring herself to wear anything that david bought her
she hesitates at the top of the driveway to the house steels herself to walk down
but just at that moment the door opens theres a homely looking woman early s
she is holding the hand of a three year old
jenny is stunned
but theres more to come
the woman deposits the child in the drive goes back into the house comes out behind an enormous s pram
david has found time to father another baby
almost inaudible hello
i think i must have the wrong house
the woman stares at her
i wanted number
its my cello lesson
she dries up and looks at the woman helplessly
dont tell me
youre a child
she turns and tries to walk back up the driveway but the woman wont let her go
you stay here
if youre old enough to sleep with him youre old enough to look at me
but she doesnt move either
you didnt know about any of this
jenny shakes her head
they never do
did he ask you to marry him
of course he did
youre not in the family way are you
because thats happened before
jenny shakes her head
thank god for that
at least you can escape intact
beat relatively speaking
not all of them have done
she nods at the children
thats why he never goes through with anything
he does love them
looking into the pram shes beautiful
bitterly hes four months old
jenny does the maths
its all she can do to stop herself from reeling backwards shes visibly shaken
babies often are that sort of age
perhaps you can remember a night four months ago when he seemed a little distracted
if youll excuse us
she pushes past jenny and leaves her standing bereft on the path
marjorie and jack are in the kitchen
marjorie is sipping tea shoulders hunched defeated
jack is pacing around the room furious
normal life has clearly been suspended during this crisis
jenny walks in
did you see her
i saw her
i didnt talk to her
there wasnt any need
well weve got to have this out
if you wont do it i will
he starts for the door
contemptuously sit down
i beg your pardon
im still your father jenny
oh youre my father again are you
what were you when you encouraged me to throw my life away
im a silly schoolgirl
silly schoolgirls are always being seduced by glamorous older men
but what about you two
he gives up hopelessly
marjorie says nothing
and now ive got nothing
jack looks at her
that doesnt mean
what i think it means does it
what are you talking about
just tell me that you didnt
you havent you know
jenny looks at him in disbelief
to jack i wondered how stupid you were
now i know
jack stands outside jennys bedroom door with a cup of tea
he knocks tentatively
close up of the floaty print dress that helen gave her
the dress is suddenly jerked out of shot and we pull back to reveal a weeping jenny stuffing it violently into an already full box of things she is throwing
the contents represent her now despised david created adult self
we can see juliette greco albums photos expensive looking jewelry boxes
she continues to stuff things into the box
theres a knock on the door
she continue to put her david life away into bags
she ignores him
jack is almost in tears
theres a cup of tea for you here
he puts the tea on the floor and sits down next to it
i know i made a mess of everything
he waits for an answer nothing
all my life ive been scared and i didnt want you to be scared
thats why i wanted you to go to oxford
so that if someone asked you out to a nice restaurant you wouldnt panic about what was a starter and what was a main course
and then david came along and he had money and he knew famous writers and he knew how to get to classical music concerts
but he wasnt who he said he was
he wasnt who you said he was either
jenny is about to rip a poster off the wall but she pauses
the other day your mother and i were listening to a programme about cs lewis on the radio and they said he moved to cambridge in
and i said to marjorie well theyve got that wrong because how would our jenny get her book signed if he wasnt in oxford
jennys face crumples
she knows hes right
jenny im sorry
jenny is sitting on the sofa in dannys flat
danny and helen are in dressing gowns there are newspapers strewn around
danny pours her a brandy
helen is sitting next to her holding her hand
i dont really understand what difference it makes
when i found out that
i tried to tell him
im not speaking to him now if thats any consolation
bitterly its a funny world you people live in
you both watched me
carrying on with a married man but you dont think its worth saying anything
ah well if you want that sort of conversation
you watched david and i help ourselves to a map and you didnt say much either
he holds jennys gaze
she looks away
jenny has put on her school uniform for this meeting it completes a circle
shes back where she started from or would like to be anyway
if she seems older than she did when we first met her its because things have happened to her and theyve left a mark on her face
shes worried and tired
the headmistress meanwhile is delighted by her return but only because of the opportunities for smugness and schadenfreude it provides
your jewish friend turned out to be married already i understand
jenny doesnt say anything
she has clearly decided to swallow anything she has to
how do you think we can help
id like to repeat my last year at school
start all over again
i got the impression the last time we spoke that you didnt see the point of school
or of me or of any of us here
i was stupid
so what is the point
i know that i need to go to university
and what happens if some other chap wants to marry you during your studies next year
laughing bitterly some other chap
there wont be any other chaps
not for a long long time anyway
im afraid i think youre the sort of young lady who attracts chaps whether she wants to or not
no i think the offer of a place at this school would be wasted on you
you showed how little you valued us only weeks ago
and i must confess that it gives me a sort of grim satisfaction to return the sentiment now
bitterly is it really so grim your satisfaction
it gives me no pleasure to see our schoolgirls throw their lives away
although of course youre not one of our schoolgirls any more
through your own volition
i suppose you think im a ruined woman
oh youre not a woman
jenny stands up and leaves without saying a word
the headmistress is pleased with her final line
jenny working hard in her room
its been completely stripped bare of everything except schoolbooks
she has become ageless genderless her life is now monastic
jenny walking alone through her old park
jenny on her own smoking nervously
hattie and tina come in
they obviously havent seen her since it all happened
they both hug her sympathetically and sit down
nobody knows what to say
im sure my uncle knows someone who could kill him
if that would help
jenny smiles wanly and briefly
we should have stopped you
did you want to
of course we didnt
why would we stop you
restaurants hotels foreign cities no exams
whod have thought thered be a down side to all that
i could tell you all about the imagery in jane eyre
but i couldnt see that a man who stole maps from old ladies might be a liar
they look at her
this is new information
well if youd told us that we might have tried to stop you
there are a lot of things i didnt tell you
i was dreaming
thats the thing about our lives isnt it
its so easy to fall asleep when theres nothing to keep you awake
are you getting on with the work all right on your own
no im not
jenny in a suburban street
shes looking for an address
she finds the house walks down the path rings on a bell
miss stubbs comes to the door
its a warm greeting
she ushers her inside
its a proper bohemian flat up in the eaves
there are books and papers and paintings covering every available surface
jenny looks around
finally for the first time we see her in somewhere she can feel at home
this is lovely
miss stubbs makes a face
but it is
id love to live somewhere like this
miss stubbs laughs
oh its not hard
go to oxford and become a teacher and this is what you end up with
but all these books and pictures
posters and postcards
apparently understanding something yes but
thats all you need isnt it
just a place to
im sorry i said those silly things
i didnt understand
lets forget all about it
a poster catches jennys eye
a burne jones
miss stubbs laughs
you make it sound as though its an original
do you like him
gosh you sound very old and wise
heartfelt i feel old
but really not very wise
miss stubbs im
i need your help
i was so hoping thats what you were going to say
eighteen months later
swelling orchestral music
close on jenny cycling absorbed happy the cello strapped to her precariously
the camera pulls back to show her cycling through the streets of oxford
shes done it
we follow her for a little while
she dismounts outside a church and leans the bike against a wall
just as shes about to leave it she sees something and freezes
we follow her gaze its the red bristol parked a little way down the road just in front of her
she scans the street to see if she can find david
she can hes coming round a corner a littler further down the street unwrapping a packet of cigarettes
jenny moves into his eye line
he sees her stops then walks towards her
jenny says nothing
i wanted to tell you that i am going to ask my wife for a divorce
jenny looks at him disbelievingly
dont you understand what youve done
david looks at her
this isnt going to be as easy as he thought
i can see my behaviour must have been
but weve never sat down and had a proper chat about it all
about the whys and wherefores
they can wait
the important thing is that youre still my minnie mouse and i love you and you had fun
you know you had fun
i had fun
but i had fun with the wrong person at all the wrong times
and i cant ever get those times back now
beat look david
im in oxford
every day i wake up and pinch myself
and when i think how close i came
she looks at him and shakes her head as if awaking from a dream
a young man stops behind her on his bike dismounts leans his bike against the wall next to hers waits for her to finish
she turns her back on david and the young man offers her his arm
they walk away together and david stares longingly after them
