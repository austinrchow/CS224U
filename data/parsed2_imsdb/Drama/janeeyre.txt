written by moira buffini adapted from the novel by charlotte bronte first light
jane eyre is running across a meadow flushed and breathless the hem of her plain black dress soaked with dew
she carries a shawl and has a small bag of belongings over her shoulder
she trips falls to her knees looks back
expressive eyes open features
she is desperate
we see the house she is running from a jacobean battlemented mansion
her need to escape is so great that she crawls forward until she is able to raise herself to her feet
she reaches an antique stile by a brook
she lifts herself on to it
she lands on the road
the sun is higher in the sky
jane exhausted now running down a main road
her spirts lift at the sight of an approaching coach
she flags it down
jane empties her purse into the drivers hand
he looks at her money then suspiciously back at her
a terse nod indicates she can get in
jane sinks into a dark corner
her fellow passengers look shocked by her dishevelled appearance at such an early hour
she undertakes a tremendous effort not to betray her emotional state
she doesnt sob she doesnt howl although her breathing threatens to
slowly unable to bear the day she closes her eyes
a whitewashed stone pillar set up where four roads meet on a barren moor
the coach driver opens the door
with a curt nod he indicates that jane must get out
she looks around dismayed
in each direction there is open moorland for as far as the eye can see
the driver sets off at a good pace glad to be rid of such a passenger
jane puts her hand to her side for her bag of belongings
it is not there
she runs as fast as she can after the coach
it is receding towards the horizon
she comes to a halt objectless lost alone
she pulls her knitted shawl around her
she leaves the road and sets off across the moor into the gathering dark
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
jane is on her knees by a strange overhanging rock
the night sky is awesome the universe is all around her
she is trying to calm herself with a prayer
jane lies on a great rock soaking up the heat of the sun
she is like someone numb with pain
she watches a lizard crawl over the rock
she is mesmerised
jane squats in the heather and eats bilberries as the light fades
she hungrily licks the juice from her hand
jane is asleep in the heather her shawl wrapped around her
a red haired child in a white nightgown lies by her side watching her
it is helen burns
helen reaches out
she touches janes hand
she sits up
she is alone
jane is crouched on a rock watching the waters go by
the sky is overcast
the first big drops of rain land on the stones
jane makes no movement
a raven lands on a rock nearby
jane is suddenly filled with a wild rage
she picks up a stone and hurls it at the bird with a raw cry
the gesture exhausts her
she watches the bird wheel away as the rain starts to pour
it is raining hard
jane sees a small girl come out of the farm with some leftovers
she drops them into a pigpen
jane leaning into the pigpen
she picks a stiffened mould of porridge out of the mud
she lets the rain wash it
she eats it ravenously
it has stopped raining
jane is huddled under a tree
she is shaking shuddering
the life has gone out of her eyes
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
the moors rise away above her to the horizon
jane looks up at the sun starting to set
the clouds are red and gold
she sees a small red haired girl in a white nightgown walking barefoot on the moors ahead of her
the girl turns looks back at jane
with her last strength jane follows
dark clouds are banking up the rain starts again
jane is struggling through a marsh
her boots are stuck
her hand disappears into mud her face pressed against the earth
she doesnt move
she has reached the point of despair
the girls bare feet walk close by as if waiting for her
jane looks up
where the child should be she sees a light shining across the moor
jane starts crawling
jane is toiling on through the lashing rain towards the light
it has become a window
a brief flash of lightning shows her a low stone cottage
helen burns is sitting on the gate
jane is crawling through the narrow garden
on her knees she peers through a window
on either side of a bright little fire sit two young women
they look exactly like jane slight neat dressed in black
one diana has her hair slightly curled and hides her gentle eyes behind spectacles
the other mary is very young no more than seventeen
each has a book on her knee
they are talking intimately
they look so close so loving and the room looks so cosy that it pains jane considerably
jane knocking at the door
hannah an old servant answers
she is suspicious jane looks like a wretch
what do you want
jane manages to find her voice
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
i cant take in vagrants
heres a penny
now take it and go
i have no strength to go
you can move off
and if there are others with you tell them we are not alone
we have a gentleman here and dogs
but i must die if i am turned away
the door slams shut
jane lets out a hopeless wail
god help me
i will die
she turns away her hope gone
as she collapses she finds herself supported by a strong pair of black clad arms
all of gods creatures must die
but not prematurely and not on my doorstep i hope
jane is lifted up
she finds herself looking into the face of the handsomest man she has ever seen st john rivers
he lifts her over the threshold into the warmth of moor house
a fire is roaring in the stove
hannah is bent over it
weve had a beggar woman come mr rivers
i sent her for shame
hannah falls silent as she sees jane
you did your duty in excluding her
let me do mine in admitting her
he sets jane down before the hearth
she can barely stand
she is soaked to the bone filthy with mud
her skin has a ghastly pallor
diana and mary enter
st john who is it
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
i dont know i found her at the door
i thought her one of the gypsies from the cross
shes as white as death
jane can hold herself up no longer
diana moves forward
she and st john catch jane and help her into a chair
the rain hammers on the windows
hannah some water
shes worn to nothing
she looks like a spectre
st john if you hadnt taken her in we would have fallen upon her dead body in the morning
shes no vagrant im sure of it
theres milk and bread for you
jane tries to mouth her thanks
she sips the milk
eats a mouthful of bread
diana kneels at her side
ask her her name
i i am j jane cannot speak
shes incapable of uttering her own name
she hears john reeds voice calling from far away
please tell us how we may help you
can we send for anyone
who are your people
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
the questions are deeply troubling to jane
she is losing consciousness
she sees an image of a small girl of ten running away through a great darkening room
jane tries to follow her
the action draws her up out of the kitchen chair
she hears john reeds voice again
where are you
jane panicked looking for somewhere to hide passes out
rain hammers against the windows
jane aged ten looking hunted runs in looking for somewhere to hide
she springs behind a curtain
john reed enters a fourteen year old his stomach bursting out of his fancy clothes
he is holding a riding crop as if it is a sword
come out rat
i know you are in here
come out now and i wont punish you
jane watches him pass by her
he practises a perfect lunge
jane breathes a sigh of relief
she slowly pulls the curtain across making the window a private sanctuary
there is a book lying on the seat
she opens it
jane is sitting cross legged completely absorbed in her book a beautifully drawn picture of a cormorant
she runs her finger over it
we hear the sound of great waves plunging on to a shore
jane aged ten is sitting cross legged on an isolated rock her eyes locked with those of a stooping black cormorant
st johns voice comes from a long way away
diana mary help me get her upstairs
the cormorant raises its wings like a great black cloak
jane watches as it takes off and flies away
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
jane has her eyes closed
a great atlantic wave hits the sash window behind her drenching it with foam and brine
suddenly the curtain is pulled back
john reed stands in front of her
jane shrinks back
i have been looking for you these last ten minutes
what do you want
say forgive me master reed
i have done nothing wrong
john grabs the book
who gave you permission to read my book
i wasnt aware it was yours
everything in this house is mine
youre lucky to live here with gentlemans children like us
your father had nothing
you should go and beg
jane stares him out
john can sense her contempt
he belts her with the book
jane hits her head on the window clasp drawing blood
she is shocked
thats for the look you had on your face
you bad animal
she throws herself upon him the rage in her released pummelling scratching hurting him in any way she can
she is barely coherent
wicked and cruel you are a slaver a murderer i shall tell mother i hate you john reed
i hate you jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
john is flabbergasted
like all bullies he is terrified
theres a rat
jane bites him
at that moment mrs reed appears on the scene
we see mrs reeds shocked face
she is an overweight woman pushing forty in a bright elaborate dress
dinah and mary are gently taking janes soaking clothes off one at each side of her
jane is distressed approaching a delirium
she resists them
jane is carried in and set down on a footstool by two servants miss abbot and bessie one at each side of her
she is still resisting
for shame hitting your master
if you dont sit still you must be tied down
the fight goes out of jane
she sits defeated
bessie young and plump quickly wipes her bleeding forehead
she has some compassion
miss abbot has none
what we do is for your own good
if you are passionate and rude like this your aunt reed will send you away
youre worse than us servants
we work for our keep you do nothing
pray for forgiveness miss eyre or something bad will come down that chimney and fetch you away
the door slams
they are gone
jane slowly grips the edge of the stool
the room is chill silent
red walls and curtains murky in the fading light
in front of jane a stone fireplace gapes like a mouth
beside it a full length looking glass in which her pale reflection stares out
behind her a bed supported on pillars of mahogany hung with red
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
the piled up pillows and mattresses glare in cold white
janes breathing is the only sound in the room
a sudden gust sends rain pelting against the windows like fingernails
a distant moan of wind seems to breathe out of the black hearth
jane reverts her nervous gaze to the pitted mirror
her eyes lock on the small figure trapped in the mirrors visionary hollow her white bleeding face her eyes glittering with fear
it is a phantom
the eyes are black the skin a deathly grey
janes breathing becomes choked with terror
she cant get her breath
we hear blood rushing through her ears
it sounds like the beating of great wings
slowly a light appears over her
it may be something shining in from outside
but to jane it seems as if it is surrounding her enveloping her
the figure in the looking glass opens its mouth
the scream held in so long finally rips from janes throat
at the sound of the scream mrs reed slumbering almost jumps out of her skin
miss abbott almost drops the tea tray she is carrying
jane is banging on the door screaming hysterical with terror
bessie rushes to the door and unlocks it
jane flies into her arms
miss eyre what is it
have you seen something
there was a light
we see bessies own fear as she glances into the dark room
mrs reed is storming towards them furious
bessie i gave orders that she was to be left in the red room until i came
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
but she screamed so loud maam
it is play acting
let her go
i know your tricks jane eyre and i abhor such artifice
loose bessies hands child
mrs reed prises jane away from bessie as she speaks
you will now stay here an hour longer
no aunt have pity and only when you are perfectly submissive will i let you out
please i cannot bear it silence
this violence is repulsive
i shall be killed get back
have mercy have mercy i beg you mrs reed throws her back into the room slams the door and turns the key
we hear janes unspeakable howls of terror her anguished bangs upon the door
bessie is looking at mrs reed aghast
mrs reed withers her with a frozen glare
we see jane in her distress hitting her head on the door
she falls back
on the floor her arms and legs move beyond her control
she is having a fit
when it is over we see jane unconscious
she is lying in a pool of ghostly light
through the light jane sees mary and diana rivers at her side
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
st john approaches in his parsons collar blocking out the light as he looks down
jane gazes at him remotely
im sure well find shes simply had a misunderstanding with her people
i hope shes not done anything deplorable theres nothing so sad as a fallen young woman
look at the suffering in her eyes
theyre like dark pools diana smiles at marys tendency to over dramatise
she has a peculiar face i rather like it
shes not at all handsome
shes so ill st john
ill or well shell always be plain
janes eyes slide away from him and close
a bright morning
a huge clergyman dressed in black is staring down at jane blocking out the sun
we see him from her pov his expansive chest dramatic facial hair huge flared nostrils frowning brows
he is brockelhurst the epitome of grim
there is no sight so sad and so deplorable as that of a wicked little girl
do you know jane eyre where the wicked go after death
they go to hell
and what is hell can you tell me that
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
a pit full of fire
and should you like to fall into that pit and be burning there forever
what must you do to avoid it
i must keep in good health and not die
mrs reed is by the fireside in an ultra feminine dress
she puts down her tea cup in irritation
ive been her sole benefactress and her kindest friend
but she shows no gratitude and brings nothing but discord into my house
what is her parentage
shes an orphan
her mother was my late husbands sister
on his deathbed he exhorted me to care for her
i have always treated her as one of my own
jane silently revolts against this lie
if you accept her at lowood school mr brocklehurst keep a strict eye on her
her worst fault is a tendency to deceit
im sorry to tell you that jane eyre is a liar
janes eyes flash with outrage
all liars will have their portion in the lake burning with fire and brimstone
she shall be watched mrs reed
i wish her to be made useful to be kept humble
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
you can rest assured dear lady that we mortify our girls in the sentiments of vanity and pride
they are taught to be quiet plain and modest
a passion of resentment is forming in jane
we shall root out the wickedness in this small ungrateful plant
mrs reed smiles sweetly
and as for its vacations it must spend them all at lowood
jane is climbing the staircase
john reed blocks her way
so rat youre being sent away
its as i thought youre not fit to associate with me
she cries out you are not fit to associate with me
mrs reed is at her desk
jane appears in front of her
you said i was a liar
well i am not
if i was i should say that i loved you and i dont
i dislike you the worst of anybody in the world except john reed
he is a liar not i
how dare you speak in this manner
ill never call you aunt again as long as i live and if anyone asks how i liked you ill say that the very thought of you makes me sick
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
you wouldnt dare
ill remember how you thrust me back into the red room and locked me there to my dying day
even when you knew it was haunted and i begged to be let out
people think you are good but you are bad and hard hearted and ill let everyone at lowood know what you have done
children must be corrected for their faults
deceit is not my fault
but you are passionate
my uncle reed is in heaven and can see all that you do and think so can my mother and father
they know how you hate me and wish me dead
they can see
they see everything you do and they will judge you mrs reed
mrs reed has turned quite pale
jane blazes with victory
bessie is waiting with jane while her belongings are loaded onto a public coach its top laden with passengers
youre such a queer solitary little thing
if only you could make yourself more appealing
perhaps if you tried smiling from time to time people would find you more pleasant dont scold me bessie
i know you dislike me i dont dislike you miss im fonder of you than of anyone
you dont show it
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
miss jane jane throws her arms around bessie and embraces her with great force
bessie returns the embrace surprised moved
jane gets into the coach
bessie looks up at the driver
you take good care of her
janes small pale face peers out of the coach window watching gateshead recede
she doesnt cry
but bessie cant stave off her tears
jane half asleep is carried out of a coach and into a howling gale
she is taken under a stone inscription lowood institution
she is set down in front of a woman with striking features and intelligent eyes miss temple
she bends down and looks into janes face
whats your name child
you are very young to be sent alone jane eyre
she gently touches janes cheek with her finger
jane manages the ghost of a smile
jane is lying back against clean white pillows
her hair brushed and neatly plaited
diana and mary are full of kindness but st johns face is cold dispassionate
my name is jane elliott
where do you come from miss elliott
jane gives no answer
who can we send for to help you
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
there is an intake of breath from mary
do you mean to say that you are absolutely without home and without friends
how did you come to be roaming the moors miss elliott
dont upset her st john
she must not be interrogated so
mr rivers you and you sisters have done me a great service the greatest man can do you have rescued me from death
how are we to help you if we know nothing about you
ill tell you as much as i can
i am an orphan brought up a dependent educated in a charity school where i passed six years as a pupil and two as a teacher
i left a year since to become a private governess a good situation where i remained until
diana didnt i say so
didnt i say she was a governess
we did wonder
we mean no offence but you have a certain look
mary and i work as governesses too
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
with great interest do you
we are currently trying to teach ourselves german so we may find better positions
youre not working at present
we came home only for our fathers funeral
he died three weeks ago
i am very sorry to hear it
st john has no patience with the change of subject
why did you leave your place of employment
jane sinks back in the pillows
it was a catastrophe
what did you do
i am free from any blame sir
i was happy
jane is deeply distressed
thats enough for now st john
you must rest miss elliott
the name sounds strange to jane
why did you start
because that is not my name
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
you havent given us your real name
jane shakes her head
because i must not ever be found
diana and mary glance at each other fascinated
jane is dressing herself
she stops weakly holding the back of a chair for support looking out of the window at the sun setting over the hills
merciful jesus enlighten thou me with the brightness of thine inward light
diana is helping jane down the stairs
and take away all darkness from the habitation of my heart
st john is praying over jane diana and mary as they sit at the table
mary catches janes eye gives her shy smile
join me to thyself with an inseparable band of love
for thou even thou alone dost satisfy him that loveth thee
jane finds herself staring at st john who prays ardently
and without thee all things are vain and empty
st john opens his eyes and looks searchingly at jane
she immediately looks down
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
welcome to our table miss elliott
id appreciate it if you called me jane
it is my own name
its wonderful to see you on your feet miss jane
jane turns her attention to st john
i trust i will not be eating long at your expense mr rivers
you wish to be independent of my charity
i wish to work sir
show me how to work or how to seek work thats all i ask
youre not fit enough to work
my sisters have always taken pleasure in keeping injured birds but im more inclined to put you in a way of keeping yourself and shall endeavour to do so if
thats what you wish
with all my heart sir
its a shame she has no choice of helpers st john and must put up with such crusty people as you
this school you were at miss elliot this charitable institution what did it prepare you for
we see a bundle of sharp twigs come down on a girls bare neck like a whip
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
jane flinches at the memory
was it a thorough education
miss scatcherds bitter life is in her face and voice
burns helen burns
jane aged ten looks up
she is wearing a brown stuff frock with a puritanical cap like all the other girls
silence reigns in the school hall
a red haired girl of about thirteen stands up helen burns
miss scatcherd holds up an apron in which a hole has been mistakenly cut
youre a slattern and a disgrace
helen burns undoes the back of her dress
the punishment is given a dozen sharp stinging whacks with the birch twigs
jane is appalled
but to her astonishment and awe helen burns doesnt cry she barely changes her expression
as the strokes go on seven eight nine helen seems like one in a trance
jane is deeply affected
on the eleventh stroke the door bursts open and a visiting party walks in the brocklehurst family
miss temple escorts two young girls dressed in peacock finery and two smart bombastic ladies
mr brocklehurst follows
helens punishment is forgotten as the students rush to their feet
jane in a panic drops her slate and breaks it
brocklehursts eyes sweep the room
they land on her
i might have known
the new girl
step forward jane eyre
filled with dread jane steps forward
it is my duty dear children to warn you that this girl is not one of gods own lambs
we see the look of frustration on miss temples face
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
she is a castaway and an alien in his flock and you must be on your guard against her
for this child
is a liar
he points to a tall stool
jane stands on it
this is the pedestal of infamy and youll remain upon it all day
youll receive no sustenance and no comfort for you must learn how barren is the life of the sinner
children i exhort you to shun her exclude her shut her out from this day forth
withhold the hand of friendship and deny your love to jane eyre the liar
the hall is empty but for the small figure of jane high on her stool feeling her isolation like pain
across the room is the slightly bigger figure of helen hunched the back of her dress still open the skin on her neck raw
the sun is setting
at last jane starts to sob
come now dont cry
youre not allowed to speak to me
i must be shunned
mr brocklehurst is not a god
hes not liked or admired here he said i was a liar
i am not a liar
if your own conscience approves you then so will i
jane is deeply gratified
how do you bear it
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
im a trial to miss scatcherd
she hits me to improve me
if she hit me i would get that birch from her hand and break it under her nose
youd just be punished even more
its part of life here
i have always been excluded and alone and hated
miss abbott used to call me an ugly little toad
helen approaches jane
youre not ugly
do you know what is inside you
the spark of your spirit the principle of light and thought pure and bright as perfect as anything created
what do you mean
your soul is beautiful your soul has value more value than anything on earth
is that true
god sees your beauty
even as you stand on that stool there is an invisible world around you a kingdom of spirits
it is everywhere
angels see your pain
angels know your innocence
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
helen smiles a wide smile
do you not believe in angels
they hear the door
helen runs back to her place cowers
miss temple appears in a shaft of light at the door
come here girls
the girls approach dreading more punishment
i shall investigate mr brocklehursts claims against you jane
and unless they are proved you will be exonerated
miss temple looks over her shoulder
also i understand you girls have had no food today
she quickly presses a slice of hard cake into each girls hand and walks away
jane and helen look at one another deeply moved by her kindness
jane stands between diana and mary high above moor house
they are dressed similarly in bonnets and cloaks
they watch a hawk dive their heads moving in unison
their eyes land upon moor house
weve lived here all our lives but the house must be shut up now
we cant afford to keep it on
diana and i will return to our charges in a few days and st john will go to his parsonage
down below them st john leaves moor house and walks towards the village
jane watches him
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
itll be a hard parting for us
we may not see him again for years
why ever not
he means to be a missionary
hes going to india to do godss work
can he not do gods work here
this quiet parish will never do for him he almost raves in his restlessness
it breaks our hearts
st john burns with talents and ambition
but he lacks the means for advancement here
our poverty thwarts him at every turn and so he has chosen to lay all his gifts on gods altar
weve tried to persuade him to stay but in some things our brother is he is inexorable as death
we are now without father
well soon be without home and brother
jane feels a powerful compassion for them
in one thing you are fortunate
she looks over at the horizon
you have each other
jane is looking at the high wall which is the horizon of her world at lowood
her eyes come to rest on the main door
two men are carrying a small coffin out of the school
brocklehurst follows it with a menthol soaked cloth over his mouth and nose
he becomes aware of janes eyes on him
he looks away
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
jane is creeping down a corridor in her night dress
she peers in through the dormitory door
it has been turned into a sanitarium
camphor and vinegar are being burnt
jane can hardly look at the sick girls
miss temple pale with exhaustion is speaking intimately to madame pierrot the french mistress
this is the result of semi starvation and neglected colds brockelhursts idea of mortifying their bodies to save their souls
miss temple cant say more
write to the governors
jane creeps on
jane opens the door
a small bed has been set up at the foot of miss temples
in it lies helen burns
a candle is set on a table at her side
jane takes her hand
is it you jane
have you come to say goodbye
im very happy
i am going home
back to your father
my father has a new wife
hell not miss me much
to my future home where all is light
i am going to god
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
jane is devastated
she climbs into bed next to helen
for a moment they hold each other
janes tears silently fall
dont be sad
i will escape great suffering by dying young
i dont have any talent to make my way in life
i should be always at fault
but god is my friend
he loves me
then he must save you
he is saving me
jane cannot articulate her distress at helens words
i feel like i could sleep now
i like to have you near i wont leave you
youre so warm and alive
jane you have a passion for living
we see miss temple looking down at the bed in the dazzling morning light
jane waking has her small arms around helen as if fiercely protecting her
helen is ashen her eyes open staring at some unseen thing
she is dead
miss temple lifts jane away
jane realises what has happened
we hear the sound of her distress begin
she is inconsolable
no no no jane
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
jane is staring out at the autumn rain
she surreptitiously wipes her tears away and smiles up at mary
have you something for me to do
you are doing something already
may i see
jane hands her a book
she has drawn a bride
thats miss temple on her wedding day
she was my teacher a great influence on me
under her guidance i became a teacher too
mary turns the page
it shows a sketch of st john rivers
mary gasps in delight
she takes the book straight to st john who is diligently working at his desk
st john no mary please see how skilled jane is
st john looks at the sketch of himself
he is quite taken aback
he looks over at jane who is quite embarrassed
she is better than any drawing master we have ever had
for a moment st john seems to be weighing up whether to be insulted or not
how fierce i am miss elliott
mr rivers i wondered if you had yet heard of any work that i could do
i found you a situation some days ago but ive delayed telling you because the work is lowly and i fear youll scorn it
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
i shant mind what i do
as i am poor and obscure the help i can offer is of the meanest sort
st john what are you going to offer her
not washerwoman i hope
when i took over the parish two years ago it had no school
i opened one for boys i now intend to open one for girls
the school mistress will have a two roomed cottage paid for by local benefactors and she will receive fifteen pounds a year
you can see how humble how ignoble it is
on the contrary jane is deeply gratified
mr rivers i thank you heartily and i accept with all my heart
but you comprehend me
its a village school cottagers daughters
what will you do with all your fine accomplishments
i will save them until they are wanted
they will keep
jane smiles at him
st john is impressed
jane is at the blackboard in a freshly painted school room
in front of her are about twenty village girls aged from six to sixteen
they are hanging on her every word
jane is writing a neat line of as
janes first home is like a dolls house
she walks through it from the whitewashed bedroom with its little single bed through the parlour with its tiny fireplace into the scullery kitchen
she retraces her steps back into the parlour
she turns round and surveys it
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
silence but for the crackling of the fire and the blowing of the wind
she feels glad grateful but very very alone
she hears brocklehursts voice
i hear you are to leave us miss eyre
she spins around as if he is there
brocklehurst is at the church door jane looking at him coldly
she holds a bunch of wild flowers
she walks into the graveyard
there are over forty small graves marked with wooden crosses each bearing a childs name
one of them says helen burns
jane lays down her flowers
she looks up at brocklehurst
he cannot meet her eye
we hear the voice of mrs fairfax
if jane eyre of lowood school
jane tries to quell her great unhappiness
she springs into action straightening her furniture stoking her fire
who advertised in the yorkshire herald possesses the acquirements mentioned
jane younger and more hopeful with her belongings in a small trunk awaits an approaching public coach
and if she is in a position to give satisfactory references a situation can be offered where there is but one pupil a little girl under ten years of age
and where the salary is thirty pounds a year
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
jane is in her scullery putting all her energy into scrubbing dishes
jane eyre is requested to send references and all particulars to mrs fairfax at thornfield hall
jane closes her eyes trying to banish her thoughts
it is no good
the memories crowd in
a smiling lady dressed in black approaches her through the darkness mrs alice fairfax
how do you do my dear
what a long and tedious journey you must have had of it
john is quite the slowest driver in the county
you must be cold to the bone
are you mrs fairfax
indeed i am come and warm yourself in here
mrs fairfax leads jane up the dark corridor and into a cosy parlour
leah a young maidservant follows
your poor hands must be quite numb here let me help you
mrs fairfax undoes the ribbon on janes bonnet
jane is taken aback unused to motherliness of any kind
leah make a little hot port and cut a sandwich or two
leah eyes jane with great curiosity
she hurries away
draw nearer the fire
john is taking your trunk up to your room
knitting apparatus lies abandoned on a fireside chair
mrs fairfax moves it and gestures for jane to sit
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
ive put you at the back of the house i hope you dont mind
the rooms at the front have much finer furniture but they are so gloomy and solitary i think
jane cant help noticing that every surface is covered in lace embroidery or fine crochet
the whole room is an advertisement for mrs fairfaxs skill at handicrafts and testament to the hours she has spent alone
im so glad you are come
to be sure this is a fine old house but i must confess that in winter one can feel a little dreary and alone
leah is a very nice girl and john and martha good people too but they are servants and one cannot talk to them on terms of equality
am i to have the pleasure of meeting miss fairfax tonight
miss fairfax my pupil
oh you mean miss varens mr rochesters ward
she is to be your pupil
who is mr rochester
why the owner of thornfield
i thought thornfield hall belonged to you
bursting into laughter oh bless you child what an idea
i am only the housekeeper
forgive me jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
there is a distant connection between mr rochester and i his mother was a fairfax but id never presume on it
heavens me owner of thornfield
she continues to laugh
a bashful smile is playing on janes lips
mrs fairfax is beginning to thaw her
mrs fairfax is carrying a lamp across the great hall the only light
jane can perceive grandeur looming out of the darkness jacobean fireplace coat of arms head of a stag
very gloomy eerie
her breath is vaporising in the cold
we shall have a cheerful house this winter
as jane follows mrs fairfax up the stairs light is thrown on portraits of dour craggy long dead ancestors
with miss varens here and with you well have quite a merry time of it
dark heavy drapes another striking portrait
a dark voluptuous woman in an th century gown ruby lipped one full breast exposed
jane glances away taken aback by the womans bold expression and her nakedness
im sure that last winter and what a severe one if it didnt rain it snowed and if it didnt snow it blew a gale last winter i declare that
not a soul came to the house from november to february
mrs fairfax leads jane through the wood panelled darkness
i got quite melancholy night after night alone
when spring finally came i thought it a great relief that i hadnt gone distracted
she opens the door to a small but delightful room
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
jane looks in a fire burning a lamp lit by her bed a soft quilt pale chintz curtains
she is utterly speechless
her eight years of physical discomfort and hardship are over
good night my dear
i hope youll be comfy
mrs fairfax can see how affected she is and how hard she is trying to button it down
jane opens the curtains
she draws her breath in at the sight of the grounds
they are beautiful
jane enters a magnificent room
mrs fairfax is dusting
what a beautiful house
mr rochesters visits here are always unexpected
he doesnt like to arrive and find everything all swathed up so i keep it in constant readiness
now come and meet miss varens
did i mention she was french
adele varens an exquisitely dressed child of eight is chatting animatedly to jane and mrs fairfax
at her side is sophie her nurse a desperately shy and lonely girl
sophie has been crying because no one understands
nobody can speak to us except for mr rochester and he has gone away
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
would you ask her about her parents
mr rochesters neglected to tell me anything about her
where did you live adele before you came to thornfield
with maman but she is gone to the holy virgin now
her mother has passed away
maman used to teach me to dance and say verses
when gentlemen came to see her i used to dance for them or sit on their knees and sing
may i sing for you now
well that would be lovely
to mrs fairfax adele is going to show us her accomplishments
adele adopts a lovelorn pose
she sings an operetta song a forsaken lady plotting vengeance on her lover
her high voice warbles with pretended emotion
the effect is rather weird
jane and mrs fairfax watch open mouthed
how very french
adeles song continues as a voiceover
mrs fairfax is finishing a shawl
jane is showing adele pictures of little objects that she has sketched
adele names them in english
the song ends
jane gives adele a sketch of herself
it is me
mrs fairfax shakes out the finished shawl and puts it round janes shoulders departing before jane can protest
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
jane is delighted at the kindness of the gift
jane holds a candle the shawl around her the moaning sound of a gale outside
she holds her candle up to the portrait of the voluptuous woman
she stares at it curious both as a girl and as an artist
she brings the candle close to see how the brushwork has achieved the effect of flesh
she hears a low knowing laugh in the darkness behind her
she is startled
her own huge shadow is the only thing that moves
she hears the laugh again
she follows it through the darkness alert with fear
a door clicks shut at the end of the corridor
to her relief jane sees mrs fairfax approach with a lamp
who sleeps up here
this part of the house is quite empty except for you and me
i heard someone
you cant have done
mrs fairfax flounders for a second
oh that must be grace poole
she likes to sit up here with her sewing
rather an eccentric soul
she shouts sharply grace
a door opens
jane sees a broad faced woman with slow intelligent eyes
she looks as if she has just woken up
miss eyre has heard a laugh
grace looks at jane with sly curiosity
she leaves the sewing room and opens a door through which a flight of steep steps are revealed
grace climbs them and disappears
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
jane is on the turreted roof looking up at the cawing rooks and down at the view a white frosted wilderness
jane senses a presence behind her
she quickly turns
mrs fairfax is coming through the rooftop door
i thought i might find you up here
ive been waiting to pour our tea
im not in need of tea thank you
mrs fairfax approaches concerned
what is it child
youve been here three months now and im worried that the position is not enough to occupy your oh mrs fairfax no
im so thankful to be at thornfield
please dont think im so ungrateful as to be discontented
but its a quiet life isnt it
this isolated house a still doom for a young woman
jane looks out at the view once more
i wish a woman could have action in her life like a man
it agitates me to pain that the sky line over there is ever our limit
i long sometimes for a power of vision that would overpass it
if i could behold all i imagine
ive never seen a city never spoken with men
ive never even seen a town of any size
and i fear my whole life will pass without ever having
mrs fairfaxs troubled look makes jane fall silent
mrs fairfax looks as if she is about to say something then puts on her practical face the moment of intimacy gone
well now exercise is a great cure for anything they say
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
i have some letters to post will you take them
jane is walking with purpose carrying a bundle of letters
the exercise is lifting her spirits
the sun is sinking turning the frost gold
a brook runs close to the path half frozen
its slow trickle is the only sound to be heard
jane moves slowly acutely aware of everything around her
further into the wood the brook has frozen right across the path
jane slips on it as she passes
the noise of her feet echoes
she steadies herself
she gazes at a huddle of snowdrops their heads bowed
a crystal drop of water runs to the end of a snowdrop and begins to freeze as she watches
it is held suspended as if the whole winter is contained in it
the moon is mounting the sky
jane hears a sound like the beating of wings
the blood is rushing through her ears
her trance is broken by the figure of a great dog which glides past her so close it almost knocks her off her feet
the beating is loud not wings she realises but the rush of an approaching horse
it is almost on top of her before she can move
her shocked pale face her black garments startle both horse and rider
what the deuce the rider gets the horse under control and continues only to have his horse slip on the ice
both man and horse fall with a crash
the dog begins to bark until the hills echo with the sound
the horse is on one side the man is lying trapped beneath it on the ice edward fairfax rochester
jane is confounded
pilot get down
get down i say
can i do anything sir
rochester stares at her a tiny black figure surrounded by darkening frost the low moon behind her
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
jane doesnt move
rochester turns to his horse
with much stamping and clattering the horse clambers to its feet
rochester seems relieved
he tries to stand himself
his ankle will bear no weight
he lets out an involuntary cry
it echoes damnation
are you injured sir
rochester looks at her once more
he manages to get himself off the ice
he sits on a nearby stile
jane approaches him
she now has the moon on her face
she begins to look less like a phantom and more like a girl
if you are hurt and want help i can fetch someone from the village
im on my way there to post a letter
rochester looks as if he doesnt believe her
where do you come from
whose house is that
do you know mr rochester
no ive never seen him
rochester is trying to place her
she is a puzzle to him
youre not a servant there
i am the governess sir
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
a slow smile deuce take me i had forgotten
examining jane once more he laughs a low laugh
jane does not like to be laughed at
have you got an umbrella i can use as a stick
then try to get hold of his bridle and lead him to me
jane doesnt like his imperious tone
she looks at the horse huge trampling nervous
rochester is amused
if you would be so kind
she endeavours to catch the bridle but the horse rears away
jane falls on the ice
rochester bursts out laughing
jane picks herself up
perhaps it would be easier to bring me to the horse
i must beg of you to come here
rochester instantly leans all his weight on her
she almost crumples under it the first time she has ever touched and been touched by a man
she holds him up
and walks him closer to his horse
the horse approaches him
rochester calms it
he springs into the saddle grimacing as he wrenches his sprain
now make haste with your letter
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
rochesters spurred heel makes the horse start and rear
jane steps back
the horse bounds away the dog rushing in its traces
all three disappear
jane doesnt move until the sound of hooves has faded away
her face is flushed her eyes glitter in the dark
jane runs up to the front door
she pushes it open
to her amazement there is a fire burning in the stone fireplace
the whole hall is lit
the double doors are open into the library
mrs fairfax is hurriedly approaching
mr rochester is here
go and change your frock he wishes to meet you
i have to change
oh yes i always dress for the evening when mr rochester is here
but all my dresses are the same
you must have one that is better
hes in a terrible humour the doctor has been
his horse fell in hay lane and his ankle is sprained
mrs fairfax anxiously hurries back into the library
a large dog wanders out
jane finds herself looking at pilot
rochester is in front of a superb fire one foot bandaged and supported on a stool
pilot is at his feet and so is adele gazing adoringly at him
rochester is looking through janes portfolio of sketches and watercolours
jane feels utterly exposed as if her diary is being read
mrs fairfax timidly interrupts
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
here is miss eyre sir
without looking up let her sit
rochester continues to study her work
i have examined adele and i find youve taken great pains with her
shes not bright she has no talents yet in a short time shes made much improvement
adele is gazing at him uncomprehending her face radiant
youve been resident here three months
and from whence do you hail whats your tale of woe
all governesses have a tale of woe whats yours
i was brought up by my aunt mrs reed of gateshead in a house far finer than this
at ten years old i went to lowood school where i received as good an education as i could hope for
i have no tale of woe sir
where are your parents
do you remember them
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
and why are you not with mrs reed of gateshead now
she cast me off sir
because i was burdensome and she disliked me
lowood thats a charity school isnt it
how long did you survive there
no tale of woe
i daily thank providence for sending us miss eyre
shes a kind and patient teacher and an invaluable companion dont trouble yourself to give her a character
ill judge for myself
she began by felling my horse
i have her to thank for this sprain
mrs fairfax looks at jane bewildered
rochester lifts one of her watercolours
adele has brought me these are they yours
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
a swollen sea
a cormorant a golden bracelet held in its beak
a girls arm coming out of the water white and deathly her drowned figure underneath
where did you get your copies
out of my head
that head i now see on your shoulders
he turns the next
the top of a hill
an expanse of twilight sky
rising up a girls shape her forehead crowned with a star red hair flowing helen burns
the evening star
rochester gives her a direct gaze
why did you bewitch my horse
jane cannot reply
jane is by the blackboard where she is writing sums
tonight i will have my cadeaux
he always bring me a cadeaux
mrs fairfax breathlessly enters
sorry to disturb
hes asked for your art
jane looks at her in disbelief
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
he wishes to have it
to show to his company i should think
is this it here
jane watches helplessly as mrs fairfax takes her portfolio
jane is crossing the landing holding adeles hand
downstairs the library doors swing wide open
the sound of male laughter can be heard gentlemen walk out into the hall
rochester follows walking with a stick
all eyes turn upon the landing
jane tries to find a shadow to back into but there are none
ah there she is
it is unclear whether he is referring to adele or jane
he makes a bow
the men are staring at jane with great curiosity
it makes her uncomfortable
she tugs adele away
a box tied with ribbons sits on the table
ma boite ma boite
rochester is leaning against the mantelpiece drinking
take it away you genuine daughter of paris and amuse yourself with disembowelling it
well open it together shall we
mrs fairfax kindly leads adele away
jane is about to cross the room with them
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
he gestures to a chair by the fire
she studies rochester
he is intent on adele who is pulling a pink satin dress out of the box
im not fond of children
que cest beau
nor do i particularly enjoy simple minded old ladies
but you might suit me if you would
by distracting me from the mire of my thoughts
adele irrepressible runs across the room embracing the dress
she drops on one knee at rochesters feet
monsieur je vous remercie mille fois de votre bonte
she looks up seeking his approval
that is how maman used to say is it not
lets try it on shall we
adele skips off with mrs fairfax
and that is how she charmed my english gold out of my english breeches pocket
rochester notices how keenly jane is observing him
your gaze is very direct miss eyre
dyou think me handsome
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
i was too plain i beg your pardon
what fault do you find with me
i have all my limbs and all my mr rochester it was a blunder
i ought to have replied that beauty is of little consequence now you stick a knife under my you have other qualities sir
just so other qualities
when i was your age i was a felling enough fellow
i might have been insulted then
youre blushing miss eyre
not at all
and though youre not pretty any more than i am handsome i must say it becomes you
and now i see youre fascinated by the flowers on the rug
jane senses his mockery
id like to draw you out
come speak to me
what about sir
the choice of subject is entirely yours
how can i introduce a subject when i dont know whatll interest you
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
the fact is miss eyre i dont wish to treat you like an inferior
yet youd command me to speak
well i probably have a right to be a little abrupt and exacting on the grounds of my superiority in age
there must be twenty years between us and a centurys advance in experience
i dont think you have a right to command me just because youre older
your claim to superiority depends on the use youve made of your time and experience
ive made indifferent use of both
and this is why i sit galled by my own thoughts and order you to divert me
are you very hurt by my tone of command
there are few masters whod trouble to enquire whether their paid subordinates were hurt by their commands
paid subordinate id forgotten the salary
well on that mercenary ground will you consent to speak with me as my equal without thinking that the request arises from insolence
id never mistake informality for insolence sir
one i rather like
the other nothing free born should ever submit to even for a salary
most free born things would submit to anything for a salary
but i mentally shake hands with you for your answer
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
not three in three thousand schoolgirl governesses would have answered me as youve just done
youve clearly not spent much time in the company of schoolgirl governesses
im the same plain kind of bird as all the rest with my couple of accomplishments and my common tale of woe
i envy you
your openness your clear conscience your unpolluted mind
if i were eighteen i think we truly would be equals
nature meant me to be a good man one of the better kind and as you see i am not so
are you a villain then sir
im a trite commonplace sinner hackneyed in all the dissipations that the rich and worthless try to put on life
when i was your age fate dealt me a blow
i was cursed with a burden to carry through life
i lacked the wisdom to remain cool and i turned desperate
dread remorse miss eyre
it is the poison of life
rochester takes in her open compassionate face
and since happiness is denied me ive a right to get pleasure in its stead
and i will get it cost what it may
then youll degenerate still more
are you preaching to me
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
im reminding you of your own words remorse is the poison of life
but miss eyre if the pleasure i was seeking was sweet and fresh if it was an inspiration if it wore the robes of an angel of light
i dont know
to speak truth i dont understand you at all
my heart has long been a charnel house
perhaps itll transform into a shrine
sir i find the conversation has got out of my depth
youre afraid of me because i talk like a sphynx
im not afraid
yes you are
ive simply no wish to talk nonsense
if you did it would be in such a grave quiet manner that i would mistake it for sense
do you never laugh miss eyre
this question cuts jane to the quick
only rarely perhaps
but youre not naturally austere any more than im naturally vicious
i can see in you the glance of a curious sort of bird through the close set bars of a cage a vivid restless resolute captive
were it but free it would soar
jane opens her mouth to speak but she cannot
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
jane is playing battledore and shuttlecock with adele
her playing is full of energy very free
her cheeks looks almost rosy
it is spring
just as it turns to come down thats when you hit it
the game continues apace
rochester wanders out of the open double doors of the library
something lands at his feet
a rooks feather
he looks up at the battlements
a shape disappears too fast to see
rochesters features cloud over with an expression of shame and detestation
he stands in a terrible inner conflict
jane notices him she misses her shot
mademoiselle has got to rest
because i start to win
have mercy adele
play with pilot for a while
rochester is leaning over the balustrade his head bowed
is our game disturbing you sir
he looks up
a hard and cynical expression has mastered his countenance something resolute
jane is taken aback
on the contrary
i like your game
i like this cold hard day
i like thornfield
rochester picks up the black feather
he starts to walk across the grounds at a fast pace
ive been arranging a point with my destiny miss eyre
my destiny stood up there by that chimney like one of the hags who appeared to macbeth
you like thornfield
like it if you dare
well i dare
its felt like a plague house for years he turns the whole house now in his sights
he shouts jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
but thornfield is my home and i shall like it
adele is running after them
mademoiselle il faut jouer rochester snaps at her with shocking ferocity
keep at a distance child or go in
adeles face crumples into tears
rochester sees janes shock at his outburst
he walks away
jane isnt sure whether she has been dismissed or not
adele has run back to pilot
jane watches her
she suddenly finds rochester is back at her side
he walks her along
shes the daughter of an opera dancer celine varens
celine was a beauty and she professed to love me
her ardour was so great that ugly as i am i believed myself her idol
so i installed in her in a hotel gave her servants gowns cashmeres diamonds in short i was an idiot
to fall in love sir
youve never felt love have you miss eyre
your soul still sleeps
youre still floating gently in the stream of life unaware of the rocks ahead waiting to dash you to pieces
were you dashed to pieces mr rochester
not by celine
how can one ever truly love a woman one has paid for
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
it ended when i visited her unexpectedly one night and caught her with her handsome charmless lover
i overheard her waxing lyrical on all my defects she was mercenary heartless senseless
the whole intoxication fell away like a dream
i left her money to support the little french floweret over there whom she swore blind was mine
i see no proof of my grim paternity in her features i think pilot is more like me than she
but you took her on
adele is curled up seeking comfort from the dog
some years later i heard that celine had abandoned the brat disappeared to italy and left it destitute
so i lifted it from the mud and slime of paris and brought it here to grow up clean in the wholesome soil of an english country garden
my one good work in a sea of countless sins
jane is looking at adele full of compassion
you listen miss eyre as if it was the most usual thing in the world for a man like me to tell stories of his opera mistresses to an inexperienced
girl like you
adele looks up
rochester speaks graciously
forgive me for keeping miss eyre from your game for so long
adele is immensely gratified by his apology
jane aged ten is walking along the long gallery
she opens a door and finds herself in the red room
she stares into the mirror searching the pale face of her reflection as if trying to find an answer
a murmur seems to come down the gaping chimney a womans deep sigh
janes throat tightens with fear
something moves in the shadows behind her
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
she scans them her eyes full of terror
jane knows beyond all doubt that something is there
she hears a low laugh
it seems to be right next to her
she tries to scream jane wakes
her curtains are open moonlight spilling in
she hears it again the laugh from her dream right outside her door low and deep
footsteps run away
jane springs out of bed and pulls the door open
a door shuts at the end of the corridor
there is a single candle burning in its holder on the rush matting flickering in the draft
jane picks it up
she notices something else a curling wreath of grey smoke
she follows its trail through the pitch darkness
it is coming thickly from a half open door at the front of the house rochesters
jane rushes in
rochesters bed is on fire the hangings the curtains all are alight
the flames are leaping
rochester is asleep
she shakes him
rochester only stirs
the smoke has stupefied him
jane pulls the burning sheets off then stops he is naked
she takes his basin and douses the bed soaking him
it is i jane eyre sir
jane takes the ewer and throws water on the curtains
she pulls the soggy fabric from its rail and smothers the burning couch
when all the flames are out she rushes to the windows and opens them
smoke billows out
she stands in the moonlight coughing
rochester is sitting up staring at her
what in the name of all the elves in christendom have you done with me
for heavens sake get up
somebody has plotted something you must find out who
ill light the lamp jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
light the lamp at your peril
rochester is springing out of bed
jane turns away mortified having caught sight of his silhouetted shape
i heard a laugh outside my door loud enough to wake me
i opened it
someone was running towards the third floor
rochester is putting on a dressing gown lighting the lamp
and a candle was left burning in the middle of the floor
shall i fetch mrs fairfax sir
what the deuce can she do
then ill wake john and martha
not at all
rochester gets his coat and puts it round her
i have to go to the third floor
dont make a sound
i shant be long
jane looks at his ruined chamber the blackened drapes on the four poster bed the fireplace the huge wardrobe
it is not unlike the red room
half an hour later
jane is in an armchair
she has snuggled up in the coat
she takes in a breath smelling its owner
she nuzzles her head against it
she closes her eyes running her fingers down the lining
she looks up
rochester is watching her
his expression is peculiar
she holds the coat closely around her
did you see anything when you opened your chamber door
only the candle on the ground
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
but you heard a laugh
have you heard that laugh before
theres a woman who sews here grace poole she laughs in that way i think
grace poole you have guessed it
well youre no talking fool please say nothing about this
i will account for this state of affairs
go back to your room and say nothing
she takes off his coat good night
is that how youre going to leave me
you said i should go
rochester approaches her
jane fire is a horrible death
you have saved my life
dont walk past me as if we were strangers
what am i to do then sir
rochester holds out his hand
jane takes it
rochester wraps janes hand in both of his
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
i have a pleasure in owing you my life
there is no debt
i knew you would do me good in some way
i saw it in your eyes when i first beheld you
their expression did not did not strike delight into my very inmost being so for nothing
people talk of natural sympathies
rochester is drawing her slowly closer
jane disconcerted is trying to resist
good night then sir
so you will leave me
at last he relaxes his grip
she backs away
jane is keeling on the windowsill looking out at the rising sun
she is lit by its glowing rays inspired
its a rare feeling that prompts her mood as new and unfolding as the day itself happiness
jane looks in to see leah and martha cleaning the soot from the woodwork and windowpanes
to her amazement grace poole is there calmly sewing rings to new curtains
good day to you miss
whats happened here
only master reading in his bed last night
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
fell asleep with his candle lit and the curtains got on fire
managed to put it out with the water from his stand
did you not hear anything miss
i heard a strange laugh
its hardly likely the master would laugh when he was in such danger
perhaps you were dreaming
i was not
then you didnt think of opening your door and looking out
jane is infuriated
she turns on her heel
jane walks in
their meal is laid out
has mr rochester not sent for us today
why hes gone away
were you not aware
he left after breakfast
jane takes this piece of news like an invisible shock
hes gone to the leas mr eshtons place about ten miles from here
i believe blanche ingram is there
shes a great favourite of his
i saw her two years ago when mr rochester had a party here
oh she was a beauty i daresay the most elegant girl ive ever seen
so tall with raven hair cascading down her back i dont know how shed had it done
she sang a duet with mr rochester
they made a lovely harmony
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
i was quite surprised he didnt make a proposal
perhaps that is his intention now
jane is at the window brooding
outside the rain is pouring
adele dressed in yellow frills is concerned
quavez vous mademoiselle
without looking at her nothing
speak in english please
jane turns expecting to see adele
jane finds herself in front of her class
they are looking at her expectantly
she looks back at them curiously
eager faces plain rural clothes
she has quite lost her place
thank you girls
you may go
jane is tidying up at the end of the day
the classroom is empty
her life is bare
it shows on her face
she looks up
st john rivers is watching her from the door
do you find the work too hard
jane immediately puts on a sprightly face and continues clearing up
not at all
im getting on very well
do you feel the solitude an oppression
i hardly have time to notice it
then perhaps your accommodations have disappointed you
they are in truth scanty enough jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
a few months ago i had nothing
i was wretched
now i have a home and work free and honest
i wonder at the goodness of god and at the generosity of my friends
st john approaches her speaks intimately
what you had left before i met you i dont know
but i counsel you to resist firmly every temptation to look back
its what i mean to do
we can overcome every kind of human weakness
a year ago i was myself intensely miserable
i considered my life was so wretched that it must be changed or i would die
after a season of darkness and struggling light broke
i heard my call from god
put your trust in him jane
let him lead you to your future
st john is turning to go
why were you intensely miserable
a year ago i was weak enough to fall in love
jane moves involuntarily towards him
dont pity me i have no compassion whatsoever for you
i regarded this love as a fever of the flesh not a thing that would ever touch my soul
i scorned the weakness fought hard against it and won
jane is incredulous
st john is at her desk
it is covered in her drawings
he glances through them
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
i could have listened to temptation sunk down in the silken snare and known a feverish and delusive bliss
i could have squandered my future upon it
you could have been happy
a slave in a fools paradise
id rather my life had purpose st john suddenly snatches up a piece of paper
is this yours
his eyes in an instant seem to take in everything about her
he opens his mouth to speak then checks himself
whats the matter
nothing in the world
he folds the paper and takes it
jane looks after him puzzled
mrs fairfax approaches jane with a letter in her hand
hes back in three days he says heavens thats thursday and not alone
he gives directions to prepare all the best rooms
im to get more staff from the george inn
the ladies will bring their maids the gentlemen valets
we must accommodate them all
supplies to be got linen the mrs fairfax has worked herself up into quite a panic
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
ill get started
ill go to the george
no ill tell martha
jane can sense that the old lady is overwhelmed
may i assist you mrs fairfax
we see mrs fairfax approach jane in a rush of gratitude
jane wears a housekeepers apron over her dress
she enters rochesters room with an armful of bed linen
it has been returned to its former glory
adele is jumping up and down on the bed
sophie is trying to coax her off it
jane gives sophie the sheets
adele leaves the room with jane and skids all the way down the newly polished gallery in her stockinged feet
jane cant help smiling
jane sets down several bottles of wine on the kitchen table in order to dust them
the kitchen is a hive of activity except for one lone figure sitting quietly in a chair by the fire smoking a pipe grace poole
leah and one of the hired under cooks are talking abut her
she gets good wages id guess
wish i had as good not one fifth what mrs poole receives
jane affects not to listen but is keenly interested
and shes laying it all by
i shouldnt wonder if shes saved enough to keep her independent
shes a good hand i daresay
not everyone could do it thats for sure not even for the money
no wonder the master relies on jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
leah notices janes curious glance
she nudges the under cook
jane picks up the bottles and carries them away
as she passes she hears doesnt she know
at that moment adele rushes in
mrs fairfax tries to get her apron off
she becomes flustered
jane helps her
mrs fairfax and adele go
jane looks out of the window
her attention is focussed on two equestrians who lead the arriving party rochester and blanche the dark beauty at his side
she is laughing at something
the sun shines behind her
jane is dazzled
she turns away
jane comes up the back stairs and on to the gallery just as the ladies start to issue from their rooms
she stands back in a dark corner
there is an approach of chatter a subdued vivacity
a flurry of multicoloured silks lace and velvets go by
they descend the staircase as noiselessly as a bright mist
jane steps out
she walks right into the path of blanche ingram who is dressed in white
they both startle
excuse me miss
blanche gives her a look of ice
rochester is at the top of the stairs
they both turn
rochester has seen blanche not jane
he offers her his arm his gaze full of admiration
jane sinks back into the shadows
blanche lays her gloved hand on rochesters arm barely touching him
they glide away
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
adele and jane sit on the stairs listening to blanche and rochester sing
their voices thrill
jane is trying not to feel
but when rochester hits an exceptionally beautiful note she involuntarily closes her eyes
adele leans into jane
she is crying
what is it darling
she sing like maman
jane full of compassion takes adele back to her room
mrs fairfax enters in a great hurry
he wants you both in the drawing room after dinner
adele leaps up delighted
jane is crestfallen
not me surely
its his particular wish
he was being polite
im instructed to tell you that if you resist hell come up and get you himself
you neednt stay long
just let him see you and then slip away
dont worry no onell look at you
jane is delivering adele into the centre of the company
may i present miss adele varens
bon jour mesdames monsieurs
jane finds it hard to get a proper impression of the guests as she cannot raise her eyes to look at them
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
adele makes a dainty curtsey pink frock hair in ringlets little lace gloves
in the midst of the crowd is blanche
why what a little puppet
mutton dressed as lamb is this your ward mr rochester
english rose nineteen what a love of a child
adele blissfully disappears into a moving sea of dresses
only one guest is still looking in janes direction blanche
her lip curls in distaste
jane backs into a nearby window seat always her place of refuge
she closes her eyes
a great atlantic wave hits the sash window behind her drenching it with foam and brine
when she opens her eyes rochester is in her line of vision standing out in a crowd of unmanly men
he senses her gaze glances at her
jane looks down pulling her work on to her lap a beaded purse
she does not lift her eyes from the beads fully feeling the humiliation of her class and of her love
blanche sidles up to rochester
i thought you werent fond of children
youre right im not
then what induced you to take charge of that little doll
rochester turns away from jane
she was left on my hands
why dont you send her to school
she has a governess
jane glances up sees rochesters back to her throws her eyes down once more
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
you should hear mamma on the chapter of governesses
i had half a dozen in my day all detestable ridiculous incubi were they not mamma
did you speak my lily flower
i said governesses
the reaction is instant
oh dont mention them the very word makes me nervous
ive suffered a martyrdom from their incompetence and caprice
i thank heaven were now done with them
i have just one word to say of the whole tribe nuisance
janes fingers sew
only the briefest flash of her eyes towards the company shows her mortification
blanche has started playing a brilliant prelude on the piano
we shall have music and new subject if you please
signor eduardo what shall it be
donna bianca i give you beauty
why theres nothing new to be said
i give you back male beauty
mamma whats your idea of male beauty
my son of course
oh tedos quite typical of the young men of today
theyre so absorbed in the pursuit of fashion that theyve forgotten how to be men at all
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
i say a woman who neglects herself is a blot on humanity
but a man should pay no heed to his looks
glancing at rochester a man should possess only strength and valour
he could be a gentleman or a highwayman
his beauty lies in his power
so a levantine pirate would do for you
as long as he resembled you
rochester laughs loudly
jane is heading for the door
i am serious
to my mind a man is nothing without a spice of the devil in him
jane closes the door on blanche
she breathes in fresh air nauseous
blanches splendid prelude drifts out
rochester comes into the hall from the other door
jane instantly bends down and pretends to be tying her shoe
why did you leave the room
i am tired sir
why didnt you come and speak to me
i havent seen you for weeks
it would have been normal and polite to wish me good evening
you seemed engaged sir
what have you been doing while ive been gone
you look pale
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
i am well
youre depressed your eyes are shining with tears
whats the meaning of this
jane catches sight of mrs fairfax who is watching them with an expression of unease
rochester glares at her
a gentleman has arrived to see you sir
he says hes travelled a long way from spanish town jamaica rochester seems winded
and indeed i think he must have come from some hot country because he wont take off his coat
mr richard mason
he says youre old friends
ive put him in the morning room
rochester cannot speak
have i done wrong
not at all
please tell him ill see him directly
mrs fairfax goes
oh jane jane
this is a blow
can i help you sir
in the drawing room blanches prelude finishes to enthusiastic applause
rochester has janes hand
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
jane if all those people came and spat at me what would you do
turn them out of the room sir if i could
and if they cast you out for adhering to me
i should care nothing about it
youd dare censure for my sake
jane is frightened of his passion
for the sake of any friend who deserved it
rochester lets her hand go
he steps back
he goes to the morning room
jane peers through the door worrying how her last words have given offence
she sees a man rising to meet rochester handsome but gaunt and painfully thin
his smile doesnt reach his eyes as if his soul is not quite his own
how the devil are you
they embrace rochester doing a fine impression of delight
jane is standing on the pedestal of infamy ten years old
helen burns is walking towards her with something in her arms
the rising sun is all around her
he is yours
jane looks down at the bundle
in it is a newborn boy
jane looks up to ask helen for help
but helen has gone
jane alone with her burden teeters on the stool
the baby starts to cry
the crying becomes deafening terrifying
it is not a babys cry but a human scream
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
jane wakes hearing a savage sharp shriek of such power and intensity it seems to tear the night in two
overhead the sounds of a struggle begin a deadly one
jane hears footsteps rush past her door
she starts to pull on her dress
she hears a mans voice from above help
rochester for gods sake come
a great stamp on the floor above something falls with a thud silence
jane grabs her candle and leaves her room
the guests likewise are all issuing from their rooms some with candles some stumbling into the dark
the gallery is filling with terrified ladies and shocked gentlemen
their shadows dance grotesquely on the walls
oh what is it
who is hurt
where the devil is rochester
rochester comes forth from the door at the end of the gallery holding a candelabra
im here be composed
blanche flies towards him like a banshee
what awful event has taken place
she embraces him
rochester patiently removes her
a servant has had a nightmare thats all
shes an excitable nervous person and has taken a fit with fright
jane the only person behind rochester sees by the light of her candle that his dressing gown is trailing blood
now i must see you back into your rooms because until the house is settled she cant be properly looked after
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
is there anything i might do
miss ingram ladies please return to your nests like the doves that you are
youll take cold for certain if you stay in this icy gallery any longer
the candles flicker and fade as the guests make their way back to their rooms
rochester sees jane
come this way
make no noise
rochester stops by a low door
he puts a key in the lock
i need you
he unlocks it
a room hung with tapestries a four poster bed with its curtains half drawn
one part of the tapestry is hooked up over a hidden door which lies open to an inner chamber
a dull sickly light shines out
he goes to the inner chamber
a grim laugh greets him
thank you mrs poole
he locks the door
he goes to the bed
bring the candle
richard mason is lying one arm and all the linen soaked in blood
jane controls her reaction and makes herself useful
rochester is cleaning the wound
am i dying
she bit me while the knife was in bit me jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
it was folly to attempt the interview tonight and alone
i thought i might have done some good
it makes me impatient to hear you
she sucked the blood
said shed drain me like a vampire think of her as dead dead and buried
mason is silenced
rochester puts the bloody sponge into janes hand
i am going for a doctor
i must leave you here with him
sponge the blood away when it returns
give him water if he wants it
do not speak to him for any reason
and richard on pain of death do not speak to her
rochester takes the candelabra
he is gone
mason is staring at jane
there is something about the pupils in his eyes that she finds deadly chilling
she dips the sponge in the bloody water and wipes away the trickling gore
she hears a low moan
she looks over at the door to the inner chamber aching to know the mystery behind it
mason makes her start by taking her wrist
he is trying to say something
jane puts her finger to her lips
she is begging him not to speak
rochester and dr carter are carrying mason down the stairs
i only wish i could have got here sooner
hed not have bled so much
jane make sure the way is clear
jane looks out on to the gallery
she is pale drawn
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
a carriage waits
rochester lifts mason in to dr carter
jane hands in masons great coat
she stands back
ill ride over tomorrow to see how you do
fairfax let her treated as tenderly as may be i do my best and have done it and will do it
the carriage goes
jane prepares to go inside but rochester walks her towards the orchard
that house is a dungeon dont you feel it
it seems to me a splendid mansion sir
it is slime and cobwebs
the orchard is a different world the dawn light illuminating dewy trees
rochester is silent
jane is trying to fathom him
will grace poole stay here now
oh yes dont trouble your head about her
but sir grace poole is not the danger
he walks off pulling the heads off flowers as he passes
youve noticed my tender feelings for miss ingram
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
keep vigil with me again the night before i marry
for now youve met my lovely one and you know her
shes a rare one isnt she
a strapper a real strapper big and buxom
he throws a cankered rose across the orchard
jane manages to articulate her anxiety
id do anything for you sir anything that was right
and if i ever bid you do what was wrong youd turn to me quiet and pale and say i cannot do it
and youd be as immutable as a fixed star
rochester gazing at her seems to have decided something
he turns a corner and is gone
jane is left alone
we hear the sound of a blow
the brutal face of john reed aged fourteen triumphant after hitting jane
thats for the look you had on your face
jane enters as rochester helps blanche to line up a shot
he is leaning intimately over her
she coyly permits him
excuse me sir
jane has ruined blanches shot
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
does that creeping creature want you
rochester has followed jane out of the billiard room
if you please i want leave of absence for a week or two
what to do
jane shows him the letter
this is from my old nurse bessie
she says my cousin john reed is dead
he ruined himself and has committed suicide
the news has so shocked his mother my aunt that its brought on a stroke
what good can you do her
shes been asking for me
i parted from her very badly and i cant neglect her wishes now
promise me you wont stay long
sir it seems you are soon to be married
what of it
adele should go to school
to get her out of my brides way who might otherwise trample her
and i must seek another situation
i intend to advertise
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
at your peril you advertise
trust it to me
ill find you a good situation in time
he is on the point of returning to the billiard room
forgive me but i have had no wages as yet
how much do i owe you
rochester looks in his wallet
thats too much
take your wages
then i only have a ten
now you owe me five
come back for it quickly
meantime i shall safeguard it in here
he taps the wallet which is in his breast pocket
do you trust me to keep it jane
not a whit sir
you are not to be trusted at all
rochester strides away grinning
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
bessie now housekeeper is moving forward to meet jane
i knew youd come
im not too late
how is mrs reed
she may linger yet a while
shes spoken of you daily
at first we couldnt tell what she was saying but when her speech came clear we heard jane eyre get jane eyre
shall i see her now
ill take you up directly
but look at you
what a lady youve become
why youre almost pretty
jane takes her aunts hand
mrs reed looks very near death
it is jane eyre
you sent for me and here i am
mrs reed with an effort pulls her hand away from janes
no one knows the trouble i have with that child
such a burden
left on my hands
speaking to me like a fiend
the fever at lowood
she should have died
why do you hate her so
reeds sister his beloved
when news came of her death he wept like a fool
sent for the baby
sickly thing not strong like mine
but reed loved it
kept it by his bed
made me vow to bring the creature up
why did he not love mine
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
the words are a revelation to jane
mrs reed gazes at her
who are you
i am jane eyre aunt
is there no one in the room
jane motions bessie to go
we are alone
ive twice done you wrong
i broke the vow i made to reed please dont think of it i am dying i must get it out
mrs reed indicates a box on her bedside table
open that box
take out the letter
she reads the letter aloud
madam will you have the goodness to send me the address of my niece jane eyre
i desire her to come to me at madeira
fortune has blessed my endeavours and as i am childless i wish to adopt her and bequeath her at my death whatever i may have to leave
yours john eyre madeira
jane is stunned
this is dated three years ago
why did i never hear of it
because i wrote and told him you had died of typhus at lowood school
you were born to be my torment
ill never forget how you turned on me and raged
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
you called the names of the dead down upon me
i was afraid
you cursed me
i would have loved you if youd let me
my life has been cursed
please let us be reconciled
mrs reed shrinks from janes touch
jane wipes her tears
then love me or hate me as you will
you have my full and free forgiveness
now ask for gods and be at peace
mrs reeds eyes close
the morning sun is pouring in
jane goes to the bed
she puts her hand upon it gently as if thanking her uncle for all he did
she notices a picture on the wall
a miniature of a brown haired woman with elfin eyes
jane takes it off the wall
bessie comes in
a tear rolls down janes face
she clasps the picture looking round the room
why ever was i so afraid
a coach pulls up in the lane near thornfield
jane gets out
we hear her voice
my dear uncle some years ago my aunt reed mistakenly informed you that i had died
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
jane is walking through the wooded glade where she first met rochester
all is green and verdant and bathed in sunset light
there seems to be life everywhere
i am writing to tell you that i am very much alive and living at thornfield hall where i am currently governess to the ward of mr edward fairfax rochester
there you are
rochester is sitting on the stile where they first met
for a moment her every nerve is unstrung
just like one of your tricks to steal into your home along with the twilight
where the deuce have you been this last month
i have been with my aunt sir who is dead
a true janian reply
if i dared id touch you to see if you were real
jane puts out her hand
rochester takes it
he helps jane over the stile
go home stay your wandering feet at a friends threshold
jane lets go of his hand
thank you mr rochester
im strangely glad to get back again to you
wherever you are is my home
jane knowing she has said too much turns and runs over the fields towards thornfield
jane is on a low seat adele nestling close to her
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
were expecting the announcement very soon
he went down to london only last week to buy her a new carriage
then we must accept it
hell soon bring home his bride
mrs fairfax nods
jane is alone drinking in the beauty of the evening looking at the gardens as if she may never see them again
she turns a corner and sees rochester staring intently at something
his back is to her
she is about to tiptoe away
come and look at this fellow jane
jane approaches wondering how he has sensed her presence
rochester is looking at a huge moth
look at his wings
he looks west indian i have never seen one like him here
they watch the moth as it flies towards the house
thornfield is a pleasant place in summer isnt it
ill be sad to leave it
yes but it cant be helped
i soon hope to be a bridegroom
have you found me a new situation sir
a situation yes of course
its the least i can do for a faithful paid subordinate such as yourself
youre to undertake the education of the five daughters of mrs dionysus ogall of bitternut lodge connaught
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
youll like ireland
theyre such warm hearted people they say
it is a long way away sir
weve been good friends jane havent we
but with the irish sea between us youd soon forget me
janes great distress escapes her
i wish i could
i wish id never come here
i love thornfield ive lived a full life here
ive not been trampled on or petrified or buried with inferior minds
ive talked face to face with what i reverence with what i delight in
ive known you mr rochester then why must you be torn from me
because of your bride
i have no bride
but you will have
yes i will
then i must go
you must stay
do you think i could stay to become nothing to you
am i an automaton a machine without feelings
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
do you think that because i am poor obscure plain and little that i am soulless and heartless
i have as much soul as you and full as much heart
im not speaking to you through mortal flesh
its my spirit that addresses your spirit as if wed passed through the grave and stood at gods feet equal as we are
rochester takes jane in his arms
as we are
jane struggles away from him
let me go
im a free human being with an independent will which i now exert to leave you
rochester releases her
she stands in front of him
then let your will decide your destiny
i offer you my hand my heart and a share of all this
he gestures towards the house the land
jane is stunned
i ask you to pass through life at my side
jane you are my equal and my likeness
it is you i intend to marry
are you mocking me
do you doubt me
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
you have no faith in me
not a whit
you little sceptic
your bride is miss ingram what love have i for miss ingram
what love has she for me
i caused a rumour to reach her that my fortune was lost and got instant coldness
i wanted to make you jealous to move you to love me
its you you strange unearthly thing
i love you as my own flesh
you poor and obscure as you are please accept me as your husband
jane begins to believe him
are you in earnest
i must have you for my own
you wish me to be your wife
i swear it
you love me
then sir i will marry you
neither jane nor rochester moves
darkness is almost complete
still the intensity of the embrace is held
it will atone
it will atone
a sheet of lightning momentarily lights up the sky
some moments later a distant rumble of thunder
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
it is teeming with rain
rochester and jane run to the front entrance
he holds his jacket around her
they reach the dry hearth inside
they are both euphoric breathless laughing
i must go
he kisses her
they kiss again
jane will not let him go
as jane runs upstairs she sees mrs fairfax deeply shocked
jane wears a lilac gown
mrs fairfax is very concerned
have you accepted him
well i never would have thought
jane is hurt
am i a monster
is it so impossible that mr rochester should love me
no ive long noticed that you were a sort of pet of his
but youre so young and so little acquainted with men
i dont want to grieve you child but let me put you on your guard
gentlemen in his position
lets just say theyre not accustomed to marry their governesses
until you are wed distrust yourself as well as him
please keep him at a distance jane has heard enough
she turns away
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
jane walking through finds herself in rochesters arms
she laughs as he raises her off the ground
is this my pale elf
this sunny faced girl with the radiant eyes
it is i jane eyre sir
soon to be jane rochester
it can never be sir
human beings were not meant to enjoy complete happiness on this earth
its too much like a fairy tale
let the fairy tale begin
rochester is rolling out reams of beautiful silks
jane gets more uncomfortable as she looks at them
this morning i wrote to my banker in london to send certain jewels
in a day or two i hope to pour them into you lap oh no sir i will put the diamond chain around your neck myself i dont want jewels
ill dress you in these satins then you wont know me
ill not be jane eyre any longer but an ape in a harlequins jacket
put them away
jane pushes the silks away
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
well for cool native impudence and pure innate pride you havent your equal
im naturally proud
and hard and flinty
you ought to know what sort of bargain youve made while youve still got time to rescind it
i want only one thing from you mr rochester
and whats that
jane puts her arm through rochesters
its your time now little tyrant but itll soon be mine and when i have seized you to have and to hold ill attach you to a chain like this
rochester flicks his watch into the air
a summer gale
the moan of the wind sounds almost human
the light is sickly nightmarish
a great box sits on the table which jane is opening
adele sophie and mrs fairfax are all looking on
jane pulls out a pearl coloured wedding gown
she is dismayed at its opulence
she holds it up to herself
adele starts to play with the great veil
she wraps it round herself
she becomes caught in it tangled distressed
there is a candle alight at the end of her bed
her eyes focus
her wardrobe is open
jane is unnerved
adele is that you
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
a form emerges a woman tall and gaunt with thick black hair hanging down her back
she is dressed in a nightgown like a shroud
over her head she wears janes bridal veil a phantom bride
jane is paralysed with terror
the form takes the veil and slowly tears it in half bruised arms dirt predatory nails neglect
the last thing to be revealed is the womans face pale and ghastly
her eyes are glittering with hatred
the figure takes the candle and bends down to jane
her intention looks deadly
janes breath catches
she cannot breathe
the figure moves closer then blows out the candle
jane wakes lying half out of the bed
the veil is over her
she flings it away from her face
jane sits her terror dawning
her breath comes in great dry sobs
she is shocked to find herself still alive
jane is waiting pale with anxiety
a man on horseback approaches a great dog at his side rochester
he is grinning
he pulls jane up on the horse in front of him
she curls into his arms desperate for his comfort and his strength
rochester senses something is wrong
he slows the horse
what is it
rochester holds the torn veil in his hands
he is aghast
he cannot think what to say
jane this is the only explanation
it must have been half dream half reality
a woman did enter your room last night and that woman was must have been grace poole jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
it was not grace poole
rochester keeps talking over her
you know how strange she is
what did she do to me
in a state between sleeping and waking i was not asleep
you noticed her entrance and her actions but youve ascribed to her an appearance different from her own
that was your nightmare i know what i saw
i see youd ask why i keep such a woman in my house
when weve been married a year and a day i promise ill tell you
are you satisfied jane
do you accept my solution
jane clearly doesnt
rochester takes her in his arms
it was only the veil
jane is in an unadorned pearl wedding gown
adele gives her a small bouquet
jane hugs her very moved as if she is leaving her childhood behind
she turns to go
please you must look
jane gazes stupefied at the stranger in the mirror
rochester is waiting at the bottom of the stairs for jane
she slows when she sees him
she finds she cannot speak
neither can he
mrs fairfax is by the door
jane cant find words for her
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
rochester grips her hand
they quit the house
rochester grimly resolute is striding at a pace jane can hardly follow
her satin shoes are muddy
she is becoming breathless
a rook flies over their heads cawing
rochester is striding purposefully towards a small church of ancient design
rochester is contrite
jane tries to collect herself
she looks up to the sky
the rook wheels around the spire
she takes rochesters hand
at the altar jane glances at rochester
he is looking straight ahead at the clergyman wood
i require and charge you both as ye will answer at the dreadful day of judgement when the secrets of all hearts shall be revealed that if either of you
know any impediment why ye may not be lawfully joined together in matrimony ye do now confess it
there is not a sound
rochester still doesnt look at jane
the clergyman prepares the rings
edward fairfax rochester do you a commotion at the back of the church
two men rapidly enter
one of them briggs hurries up the aisle
the marriage cannot go on
i declare the existence of an impediment
rochester moves shaken
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
the ceremony is quite broken off
an insuperable impediment to this marriage exists
mr rochester has a wife now living
wood is utterly dismayed
where is your proof
briggs starts to read out a document
i affirm and can prove that edward fairfax rochester was fifteen years ago married to my sister bertha antoinetta mason at st james church spanish town jamaica
jane looks at rochester
she forces him to look at her
he denies nothing defies everything
the record of the marriage will be found in the register of that church a copy of it is now in my possession
signed richard mason
rochester turns to briggs
that does not prove that my wife is still living
she was living two months ago
how do you know
i have a witness to the fact
produce him or go to hell
the figure by the door steps out of the shadows
it is richard mason
rochester flies down the aisle a groan of rage escapes him
he lifts his arm
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
good god sir you are in a sacred place mason flinches away
rochester swallows his rage
what have you to say
she is at thornfield hall
i saw her there in april
im her brother
a grim smile contorts rochesters lips
he turns towards jane
she remains where she was abandoned at the altar tiny under he vaulted arch
the bouquet falls from her hand
rochester walks to her
this girl knew nothing
she thought all was fair and legal
she never dreamt she was going to be entrapped into a feigned union with a defrauded wretch
a tiny breath is the only noise jane utters
rochester pulls her from the altar to his side
come jane come all of you and meet mrs pooles charming patient
come and meet my wife
the sun outside is blinding
jane closes her eyes
rochester enters pulling jane after him her hand still in his iron grip
wood mason and briggs follow
mrs fairfax adele sophie martha and leah are waiting
adele runs forward
rochester stops her in her tracks
do not come near
go all of you keep your congratulations they come fifteen years too late
adele has crumpled into frightened tears
mrs fairfax has her hand over her mouth pale with shock
jane meets her eye as rochester pulls her up the stairs
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
the tapestried room
rochester glances at mason
he unlocks the inner door with one hand the other wont let go of jane
grace poole sits by a strongly guarded fire stirring something in a pot
rochester leads jane and the men into the room
there is no window no furniture except for graces chair only a mattress on the floor
sir you cant be bringing folk in here
bertha antoinetta mason stands amazed at the sight of her visitors
she wears a white shift
there are black rook feathers twined in her hair her only ornament
this clothed hyena is my wife
berthas pose is dignified her expression grows triumphant
she approaches rochester her eyes locked with janes
jane gazes fear disgust compassion
i was duped into marriage with this lunatic fifteen years ago
briggs and wood are deeply repelled
let us go
we have seen enough
bertha puts her arm through rochesters lays her head on his shoulder smiles at jane magnanimous in her victory
my own demon bertha
with shocking speed and strength bertha lays her nails into rochesters cheek
he struggles with her
grace assists rochester
they do not hit they subdue
berthas attack is effectively contained
they have her on her knees her arms behind her
bertha lifts her head and screams
if a scream could express the agony of a whole soul then this would
jane turns on her heels
she stumbles finds the door exits
jane is coming down the stairs
briggs is at her side
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
you madam are clearly not to blame
your uncle will be glad to hear it
jane looks at briggs only dimly comprehending him
you wrote to your uncle did you not
to inform him you were going to marry mr rochester
mr mason was staying with him when your letter came
briggs gets only a blank look of puzzlement from jane
mr john eyre has been the madeira correspondent of the mason trading house for some years
you can imagine his distress when mason revealed the real state of matters
jane starts walking towards the sanctuary of her room
he would have come himself but im sad to tell you that his health is in mortal decline
he implored mr mason to prevent this false marriage and referred him to me for assistance
i only hope that he survives long enough to hear that you are safe
jane opens her door
she turns to briggs
she shuts the door on briggs and on the world
jane sits on her bed
she mechanically starts taking off the blond square she has worn as a veil
jane standing in stillness with the pearl dress crumpled around her feet
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
jane has taken a black stuff dress off its hangar
she slowly puts her arms around it as if it is her old self
she holds it her eyes staring at nothing
jane in her underclothes sitting down on the bed
she closes her eyes
jane lies curled up on a rock at the bottom of a dried up river bed
all of nature is suspended in stillness
far away we hear the sound of a flood loosened in the remote mountains
we hear the sound of the torrent approach
jane doesnt move
she has no will to flee
the sound of rushing water pounds in her ears
she lies waiting to be dashed away
we see the flood approach and hit
a dazzling whiteness of water and foam
janes room is entirely unchanged except for the fact that it is full of river water from floor to ceiling
her bedding furniture and belongings all sit in the room as normal underwater
the light shines murkily in through the window to reveal jane floating suspended
her hair and her garments trail out
she is alive
but she is drowned
the moon has risen
jane is lying in an exhausted doze on the bed
she wakes sits up
she is faint
she recovers herself
she knows what she must do
jane dressed in black in the silver light putting her brush comb and brooch in a bag
she looks in her purse
she has some coins
jane unbolts her door takes a step out of her room and stumbles into rochesters arms
he has been keeping guard
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
his cheek has been cut by berthas nails
five minutes more of that death like hush and id have forced the lock
he examines her face
he is desperate
your heart has been weeping blood
rochester buries his head in janes arms
she automatically comforts him
how could i
i am a worthless sinner
dont spare me
rain your tears up on me
i deserve a hail of fire
jane extricates herself from his embrace
im tired and sick
i need some water
rochester perceives janes inanition
he carries her down the gallery
jane clings on to her bag of belongings
she has nothing else left
rochester has lain jane in front of the fire
she forces herself to eat
rochester gives her wine
how are you now
much better sir
i shall be well again soon
rochester paces away to the fire
he comes back
stoops his head down to jane to kiss her
she turns her head away
i know you
you are thinking
talking is no use you are thinking how to act
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
all is changed sir
i must change too
there is no doubt that we both must change
i was wrong ever to keep you here this narrow stone vault with its one real fiend
ill shut it up
ill pay mrs poole two hundred a year to care for its inmate and then no one will be harmed when she is prompted to burn people to stab them
to bite the flesh from their bones sir you speak of her with hate it is cruel
she cannot help being mad
its not because shes mad that i hate her
if you were mad do you think that id hate you
then you know nothing about me nothing about the way i love
your mind is my treasure and if it were broken it would be my treasure still
you are my sympathy my better self my angel
i will wrap my whole existence round you
let us leave here tomorrow
come with me as my wife
ill pledge you my fidelity you cant
youll live a happy most innocent life i must leave you sir
rochester cannot take this in
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
dont you love me
i do love you but i mustnt show it or speak it ever again
i must begin a new existence strange scenes among strange faces
i must part from you
must be a part of me thats what you mean
you are my wife jane
in truth you have a wife already
i was tricked duped into wedlock with that demon hate that harlot that succubus upstairs
my father wanted her money and so i was sent to spanish town and the match was made
i hardly spoke with her
i was dazzled ignorant raw
my senses were besotted and i married her gross grovelling mole eyed blockhead that i was
rochester sits staring at the fire
i lived with her for four years
she dragged me through all the degrading agonies which attend those bound to the intemperate and unchaste
her excesses developed germs of madness and the doctors shut her up
one night unable to bear her screaming hate and knowing i could never be rid of her i put a gun to my head to kill myself
jane is both appalled and moved
i would have pulled the trigger died in that tropical place but for a breeze which blew in from the sea and smelt of home
with it i came to my senses
bertha antoinetta mason had abused my long suffering sullied my name outraged my honour and blighted my youth
it was enough
at that moment as i decided to live she ceased to be my wife
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
only my father and brother knew of the marriage and by then they were both dead
i let my connection with her be buried in oblivion and i brought her here
i have seen that shes cared for as her condition demands and that is all that god and humanity asks
i earnestly pity you sir
he sees that jane is silently crying
jane its not pity that i see in your face
its not pity do not say it it is love
they are holding each other
i was wrong to deceive you
it was cowardly
i should have appealed to your spirit as i do now should have opened my life described my hunger for a better existence shown you my chains
i give you my life
i give you my pledge
please be my wife
i can not
you would be my equal
i would make it so
you once told me that hiring a mistress is the next worse thing to buying a slave
not my mistress jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
i would not degrade you by having you live with a slave
i said wife my wife jane tries to rise
rochester keeps hold of her hand
he gently pulls her down again
do you really mean to leave me
he kisses her gently lovingly
do you mean it now
he runs his hands over her with great tenderness
jane offers no resistance
rochester lays her down
what friends would you offend by living with me
who would be injured
who would care
jane is almost lost
she speaks in a small voice
jane it would not be wicked to love me
it would be to obey you
i care for myself
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
janes resolve grows
the more alone the more friendless unsustained i am the more i must respect myself will you listen to me
i must listen to myself will you hear reason
let me go because if you wont ill try violence
jane instantly stops resisting
she looks at him with utter shock
he is above her
i could bend you with my finger and thumb a mere reed you feel in my hands
jane neither moves nor speaks
but your eye resolute free
what ever i do with this cage i cannot get at you
and it is you soul that i want
why dont you come of your own free will here to my heart
oh come jane come god help me
all the life seems to go out of rochester
he lets jane go
she pulls herself away from him
he remains his face buried
she goes to the door
rochester turns his eyes to her
you have never called me by my name
my name is edward
jane cannot speak it
she turns away
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
jane is running flushed breathless her dress soaked with dew
she has her bag of belongings over her shoulder
she trips falls to her knees
she looks back
for a moment she seems paralysed
she returns her gaze to the route ahead
her need to escape is so great that she crawls forwards until she is able to raise herself to her feet
she reaches the stile lifts herself on to it puts her arms around the post
she holds it as if it were beloved
her eyes close
we hear the sound of a winter blizzard
jane opens her eyes
she is sitting at her fireside
outside a snowstorm howls
on her knee is a sketchbook
she looks down at it
rochesters dark eye is beginning to appear on her paper
she puts a line through it scribbles it out blinding him
she stands up trying to escape her thoughts
she whispers edward
there is a loud knock on the door
jane opening the door
rochester is there standing in the frozen hurricane and howling darkness
jane pulls him inside
she falls into his arms
they embrace passionately
jane is actively pulling him towards her delirious with love and longing
the exact same shot of jane opening the door
st john rivers is there having waded through the drifting snow
mr st john what on earth brings you away from your hearth on a night like this
has anything happened
theres no bad news i hope
how easily alarmed you are
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
he takes off his cloak stamps the snow off his boots
the snow was up to my waist at one point
you are recklessly rash about your own health
st johns eyes alight on janes charcoal drawing
jane snatches it away too late
there is a moment of silence
why are you come
an inhospitable question
i mean on a night like this i got tired of my mute books and empty rooms
besides ive been told half a story and im most impatient to find out the end
jane motions to st john to sit
she becomes increasingly uneasy as he speaks
twenty years ago a poor curate fell in love with a rich mans daughter and married her
she was disowned by her family and two years later the rash pair were both dead
they left a daughter which charity received into her lap as cold as that snow drift i almost stuck fast in
charity carried the friendless thing to the house of its rich maternal relations
it was reared by an aunt in law i come to names now mrs reed of gateshead
she is on her feet
mrs reed kept the orphan ten years and at the end of that time she was sent to lowood school
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
it seems her career there was very honourable
she became a teacher like yourself and left it like yourself to be a governess
she undertook the education of the ward of a certain mr rochester mr rivers
i can guess your feelings but hear me to the end
of mr rochesters character i know nothing but he professed to offer honourable marriage to this young girl and at the very altar she discovered that he had a wife
his subsequent conduct is a matter of pure conjecture but when the governess was enquired after it was discovered that she had fled thornfield hall and no trace of her
has since been found
now isnt that an odd tale
since you know so much perhaps you can tell me how he is
mr rochester how is he
im ignorant of all concerning him
st john opens his pocket book and removes a piece of paper
well since you wont ask the governesss name i must tell you
i have it written down here in black and white
he hands her the paper
on it are doodled the heads of some of her pupils
she has absently written jane eyre in the margin several times
a solicitor named briggs wrote to me of a jane eyre
i knew a jane elliott
this paper resolved my suspicion into certainty
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
the solicitor mr briggs does he have any news of mr rochester
are you not going to enquire why he has gone to such lengths to find you
what does he want with me
merely to tell you that your uncle mr john eyre of madeira is dead that he has left you all his property and that you are now rich
you are rich quite an heiress
jane is flabbergasted
your fortune is vested in the english funds briggs has the will and all the necessary documents
you can enter on immediate possession
at last jane looks questioningly up at him
your forehead unbends at last i thought you were turning to stone
perhaps now you will ask how much you are worth
how much am i worth
oh a trifle
twenty thousand pounds but what of that
the news literally takes janes breath away
twenty thousand pounds
st john begins to laugh at janes reaction
she has never seen him laugh before
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
if youd committed a murder and id found you out you could scarcely look more aghast
there must be some mistake
its two thousand surely
you look desperately miserable about it i must say
jane still cannot take it in
she frowns in disbelief
why did mr briggs write to you
you see that is the strange thing
it makes me wonder what power or providence led you to our door
your name is jane eyre
then im you namesake
i was christened st john eyre rivers
st john eyre my mother had two brothers one was a clergyman your father the other was john eyre of madeira
mr briggs wrote to inform us that the clergymans daughter was lost
i have been able to find her out that is all
your mother was my fathers sister
my uncle john was your uncle john
that is correct
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
so you diana and mary we are cousins yes
jane is deeply moved
oh i am glad
i am glad
she throws her arms around st john
tears of happiness start to flow
he finding it peculiar to be held gently tries to calm her
here you are neglecting essential points to pursue trifles
you were utterly downhearted when i told you that you were rich and now for a matter of no moment you are deliriously happy
of no moment
you have sisters and maybe dont care for a cousin but i have nobody
i have been alone always
and now three relations are born into my world full grown
oh i am glad
you who saved my life you must try to tranquillise your feelings
jane finally releases him still radiant with joy
write to diana and mary
tell them to hand in notice and come home
they will have five thousand each and so will you
ive told you the news too quickly
dont put me out of patience cousin
i am rational enough
twenty thousand divided equally between the nieces and nephews of our uncle gives five to each
this is acting on first impulse
you dont know what it is to have jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
and you cannot imagine family i never had a home
i never had brothers and sisters a terrible thought occurs to her
you are not reluctant to own me are you
st john takes her hand
she has surprised and moved him
he looks at her seeing her anew
jane i will be your brother
jane diana and mary are running over the moors
mary has a kite
they are as delighted as children
jane is sitting at the table letting diana style her hair
they all have new summer dresses on
there is a lightness to all three as if a great weight has been lifted from their shoulders
diana is setting janes hair into curls like her own
jane looks at herself in the mirror softer gentler different
the girls each have a candle
st john kisses mary
he kisses diana
you call jane your sister but you dont treat her as such
you should kiss her too
jane turns to diana embarrassed
di you are very provoking
as she turns back she finds st johns face right in front of her
he kisses her
a kiss with no warmth an experiment
he examines its effect
he is satisfied
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
jane closes the door
she puts her hand across her lips
the icy kiss has agonised her with the full force of her loneliness
she curls up in a ball desperate
a glorious summer sunset
jane is digging at a flower bed putting all her passion into the task
she is flushed with exertion
st john watches
you are wasted here
am i not being useful
you should look beyond moor house beyond the selfish calm and comfort of affluence
beyond to what
i go to india in six weeks
st john draws jane away from her work
i can see what your gifts are and why they were given
come with me
jane is utterly crestfallen
god and nature intended you for a missionarys wife
you are formed for labour not for love
i want to claim you not for my pleasure but for gods service
im not fit for it
i have no vocation
youre far too humble
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
st john have mercy
i feel my mind shrinking dont be afraid
you are diligent faithful docile courageous gentle and heroic
cease to mistrust yourself
i trust you unreservedly
let me give you time to think
but know this in you i recognise a fellow soul a soul that would revel in the flame and excitement of sacrifice
jane is chilled to the bone by his words
st john leaves the garden and walks away over the moors
jane leaning against the garden wall trying to think trying to compose herself
the sun is setting
jane carrying a candle opens the door
st john is at the table working by lamp light
the moon shines brightly in
i used to long for a life of action to overleap the horizon to move in the world of men
maybe god is giving me this
and what is there for me here
pain and longing for what cant be
i dont know how long i would survive in india
my frame isnt strong
but ill go with you if i may go free
you and i had better not marry
because i am your sister
but youll go with me
conditionally as your curate
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
jane i dont need a curate i need a wife
i must have my heart and mind free my own self to turn to
i couldnt become part of you a part of me you must become or the whole bargain is void
how can i a man not yet thirty take out to india a girl of nineteen unless she is my wife
dont offer god half a sacrifice
he must have all
and undoubtedly enough of love would follow to make the union right even in your eyes
jane is shocked
enough of love
yes quite enough
st john i scorn your idea of love
i scorn the counterfeit sentiment you offer and i scorn you when you offer it
st john is mortified
a slow rage begins to boil in him
ive uttered nothing that deserves scorn
forgive me but the very name of love is an apple of discord between us
my dear cousin please abandon your scheme of marriage
no and if you reject it its not me you deny but god
jane is stung
st john has turned from her
his face is icy in the moonlight
do not be angry with me please
it makes me wretched
i want us to be friends
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
we are friends
i hope we can be more
i cannot come as your wife
why this refusal
it makes no sense
if i were to marry you youd kill me
youre killing me now
id kill you
i am killing you
your words are violent unfeminine and untrue youd kill me without drawing any blood or receiving on your conscience any stain of crime
what nonsense is this
youd experience no pain but i tell you it would kill me
because i would inevitably come to conceive love for you because you are so talented and good because there is such grandeur in your look
you wouldnt want this strange and torturing love if i showed it you would find it unbecoming
and my lot would be wretched
youre a good man but you forget the feelings of little people
wed better keep out of your way lest you trample us
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
st johns anger has faded
he is compassionate
this is far harder to resist
i wouldnt trample you
youd walk at my side towards gods altar
hed be your solace heaven your reward
we seek to do the greatest work to open deaths gates to save souls
love god jane love god
st john puts his hand on her forehead christlike
jane is falling under his power
give up your heart to him
he is love
jane falls to her knees
st johns face is angelic
if i were sure if i were certain she suddenly hears a voice rochesters clear urgent
she springs away from st john crying oh god what is it
she looks wildly about the room rushes to the window
what have you heard
what can you see
jane glances at him seeing him for what he is a cold controlling man
she shouts i am coming
she runs out leaving st john aghast behind her
jane runs on to the moors
wait for me
she looks all around her at the moonlit landscape
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
where are you
the moors send her question back in an echo
we see janes face
her path is clear
jane is waiting for the coach at the crossroads where she arrived almost a year before
it comes pounding towards her
she hails it
this time the coachman respectfully descends to take her bag and help her on
she is so confident and so changed that he doesnt recognise her
jane is walking through the orchard
it is wild neglected
its untended state worries her
she looks up
rooks are circling cawing
jane finds herself at the side of the house
the ground is pitted with weeds
the windows are dark
she half runs round to the front
what she sees takes her breath away
the great walls and battlements are blackened with fire
windows gape on a hollow shell
the inside of the house has collapsed
through the hanging door only its charred remains can be seen
weeds grow through utter devastation
jane gazes in horror and distress
jane knocks on the door
mrs fairfax opens it
they sent me from the inn
ive been up at the house jane can say no more
come in come in
is he dead
mrs fairfax takes jane in her arms
mr rochester still lives
jane is crying tears of relief
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
tell me please why did you run away in the night like that
i would have helped
i would have helped
mrs fairfax has sat jane on a settle near the fire
he sought you as if you were a lost and precious jewel
he didnt rest
and as days turned into weeks and no word came he grew quite savage in his disappointment
he stayed at thornfield
didnt leave the house
rochester unshaven and unkempt is standing at his threshold
shut himself up like a hermit
he only went out at night when he walked like a ghost through the grounds
we see what he is looking at an open carriage piled with luggage into which mrs fairfax is helping adele
leah and sophie are already sitting inside dressed for a journey
hed have no one near him
adele was sent off to school
he placed me here
only john and martha stayed and mrs poole of course
adele looks back at rochester with tears in her eyes
he walks across the dark hall and slams the library doors
rochester in his shirt sleeves is looking at the tree where jane promised him her hand now dying cleft by lightning
the rising moon inhabits the sky
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
it was harvest time when it happened
no one knows how she got out
rochester hears a cry from the top floor
he sets off a look of finality on his face
grace poole is asleep her empty jug of gin beside her
my theory is that when mrs poole was asleep having taken too much of the gin and water
rochester takes graces keys
rochester opens the door to the inner chamber
the mad lady must have stolen her keys and let herself out
bertha antoinetta mason standing in the last patch of daylight thrown down from her skylight sees that it is rochester
she calmly walks towards him
rochester graciously bows indicating that she may leave
bertha glides past him
she is free
bertha walks past an elegant vase
she tips it to the floor
rochester pays it no heed
rochester has stood bertha at his desk
a case of jewels is open before her
she has put on a tiara a diamond necklace bracelets
she is gazing at a ruby brooch
she turns to rochester
his expression is calm resigned
bertha begins to laugh
she takes the candelabra from the table
she admires herself in the mirror her white shift the black feathers the jewels
she holds up the candelabra and sets the huge curtains alight
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
rochester is impassive he does nothing to stop her
as she passes rochester realises he is bleeding
she has run the brooch pin across him
bertha knocks a lamp onto the floor
the oil springs into flames licking the tapestries and the paintings
rochester sees his ancestors begin to burn
the conflagration is growing
rochester sees bertha leaving janes room
as he passes he sees everything inside it being consumed by fire
he cant bear to look
bertha is watching the rooks
rochester goes to the edge of the roof
bertha looks at him
the invitation is clear
rochester is ready to die
bertha sees the rooks wheeling away
she runs at the edge of the roof
rochester sees her intention too late
he puts out his arm to stop her
for the perfect fraction of a second bertha flies
rochester sees her fall almost falls himself saves himself
life reawakens in him
behind him he sees grace poole coughing crawling up through the door
responsibility floods over him
he goes to her side lifts grace helps her down the stairs
he didnt leave the house until everyone was out
some say it was a just judgement on him for having her confined there all those years but for my part i pity him
jane is deeply affected
hes alive child but many think hed be better off dead
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
when he was taken out from under the ruins a beam had fallen in such a way as to protect him partly but his eye was taken out and his
left hand so crushed that he lost it
the other eye inflamed and he is blind
tears fall from janes eyes
its a terrible thing
i had dreaded worse
id dreaded he was mad
a great sense of urgency is coming over her
where is he
jane is walking through forest along a grass grown track
her pace is fast her journey almost at an end
she comes to a pair of rusting iron gates hanging open between granite pillars
she walks through them
she finds herself in front of a decrepit elizabethan manor house no garden just a sweeping semi circle of meadow grass which someone has cut at with a scythe
standing on the threshold is edward fairfax rochester
he is in his shirtsleeves
he stands strong stalwart brooding
his hair is still raven black
he is looking sightlessly around his domain with the concentration of a hawk
his strength is undiminished
he walks fifteen paces from the house
it brings him into the middle of the semicircle of grass
he is close enough for jane to see his scarred eyes
she walks towards him silent
a few drops of rain begin to fall
rochester puts out his right hand to feel them
he raises his face up to the sky as if he is looking for something from there
he is absolutely still his expression serene
jane is very close
she steps on a twig
it breaks with a loud crack shattering the silence
rochester is immediately on guard his expression turning wary
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
he suddenly swipes the air with his left arm the ruin of it passing an inch from her face
jane steps back
rochester swipes again
she holds her breath
he seems satisfied at last that nothing is there
he turns and walks fifteen paces back to the house
he disappears into the dark interior
jane starts to breathe again
jane lightly taps on the side door
martha opens it she is astonished
jane puts her finger over her lips
rochester is in an armchair in front of his fire
pilot is at his feet
jane carries in a tray with a candelabra and a jug of water
i can see the candles martha at your side like a luminous glow
and the fire a red haze
pilot notices jane
he leaps up with a whine wagging his tail madly
jane spills half the water
she cannot help finding it funny
her entrance has been ruined by the dog
rochesters face falls
martha is that you
martha is in the kitchen sir
pilot knows me
will you have some more water
ive spilt half the glass
rochester stands holding out his hand
if you are real touch me
jane touches his fingers puts her hand in his
rochester pulls her into his arms
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
her hand her shape her size
and her voice
jane eyre jane eyre
my edward i am jane eyre i have found you out
i am come back to you
for some while neither is able to speak
youre not lying dead in some ditch
not an outcast among strangers
ive been with good people far better than you quite more refined and exalted
she insults me and im an independent woman
my uncle in madeira died and left me five thousand pounds this is real
this is practical
i am where i love best
jane curled on rochesters knee by the fire
he is running his fingers over her face feeling its contours
youre altogether a human being jane
i conscientiously believe so sir
she is running her hands through his hair
jane eyre adapted by moira buffini march
but i see that youre turning into a lion
its time someone undertook to rehumanise you
im a sightless block i know
she kisses his eyes
and the worst of it is im in danger of loving you too well for this and making too much of you
am i hideous jane
but you always were you know
a smile cracks rochesters face
jane runs her fingers over it feeling its contours
he holds her
