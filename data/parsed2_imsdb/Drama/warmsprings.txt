written by margaret nagle shooting draft
a glimpse of sunlight desperately tries to force its way through a gray sky before being obliterated
a man sunburned and bearded lets himself fall from the edge of a boat and into the ocean
underwater through shafts of light white limbs are flailing
the man struggles alone
bubbles stream upward
he breaks the surface and gasps for air
he begins to swim
his massive arms and shoulders grab at the tide in large hard strokes
his legs and feet are buried beneath the dark ocean water
a floating tenement
a crane lowers a fishing net into the water
the man swims into it
the net is raised as he lays motionless within its grip
the crane swings around with the man in the net
he is emptied out onto the deck like a fish
ahivering on the rotting wooden planks he flips himself over on his stomach
slowly using the palms of his hands he drags his trunk and withered limbs across the deck in a labored lobster walk
he uses his chest muscles to swing his legs around the edge of the boat
they dangle like pieces of rope his feet white and flaccid
a towel a bottle and a glass are wordlessly placed next to him by a crew person
he pours himself a generous amount of scotch and begins drinking
the same man is illuminated by the light of a single candle
he is dancing holding on tightly to a woman
though the light is dim it is clear that he is clean shaven with his hair neatly trimmed
their connection is powerful and alive
they stop dancing overwhelmed with mutual desire
he holds the womans face in his hands and kisses it all over moving into a realm of feeling that is foreign to him
he kisses her passionately on the mouth
oh my dear
his fingers run softly over the outside of her breasts
she begins to undo the back of her dress and slips it down around her ankles
wearing only her tight corset she brings his hands to the laces and together they undo it
whispering softly its all right darling
its all right
oscar a manservant is carrying both a silver tray and a pair of pants over his extended arm
where the devil are you
deftly oscar opens the door to a spacious bedroom
my apologies mr
there with his bare legs muscular and lean sporting black socks held up with garters is franklin delano roosevelt
he projects a natural elegance and the confidence of a man who can have anything he wants
he wants his pants
ive been standing here for five minutes
oscar offers the tray to franklin which bear cuff links and a tiffany watch which franklin grabs
did you sleep well sir
thats good isnt it
franklin takes his pants from oscar and steps into them pulling the suspenders up and over his shoulders
striding into the dining room franklin lifts a silver lid off a breakfast plate
he dismisses it and instead pours himself a cup of coffee from a silver pot on the sideboard
he overhears a voice from the nearby sitting room
i could not be more delighted to have received your most charming letter
it has been far too long since we last corresponded
however it is with great reluctance i must decline your kind speaking invitation
eleanor roosevelt is dictating a letter
her enormous eyes liquid and blue reveal a woman of extraordinary intelligence and depth
unfortunately i would be of little assistance to the junior assistance league
particularly if my purpose were to appear as an alumna who is gifted at public speaking
she is dictating to lucy mercer deeply feminine with a head of soft dark hair and an accommodating nature
she is eleanors social secretary and closest friend
she is also the woman dancing with franklin the night before
and what do you really want me to say
thank you and if you ask again i shall scream
they share a laugh which is not shared by the homely rumpled mess of a man draped over a sofa in the corner
why dont you ask your husband for some pointers
hes a pretty gifted public speaker dont you think
louis howe is a wizened man of limited stature and unlimited soul
franklins political advisor extraordinaire part consiglieri and part priest
he is the mastermind behind what he believes will be the greatest political career of the twentieth century
he gets up and leans in closely to eleanor
a cigarette dangles off his lip and the smoke rises up and curls in her face
you should get out once in a while
accepting that invitation would be good for franklins career
howe wouldnt you be more comfortable waiting for my husband outside
in the street mrs
if you like
eleanor smiles oh so politely at louis as franklin enters from the dining room
i see its not even eight a
and already the gloves are off
kissing eleanor on the cheek good morning babs
hello miss mercer
l good morning sir
quickly she lowers her eyes to her work
annoyed youre late
honestly why do you enjoy keeping people waiting
because they always seem more grateful to see me when i arrive
he leans in and kisses eleanor on the cheek
have a lovely day babs
should i expect you for dinner
i have the navy reception this evening
ill be home quite late
unless youve changed your mind about coming
louis looks up from his paper at lucy who is writing furiously
do you wish me to come
whatever youd like
a beat thank you no
very well then
tipping his hat good day miss mercer
lucy nods and franklin exits
then louis tips his hat to the ladies and follows him out
a car pulls over and franklin is first out followed by louis walking at a brisk pace as they cross the opposite side of the street
louis struggles to keep up while consulting a small appointment book
at ten youve got a meeting with representatives from pittsburgh steel
their bid on the ship building contract has already been turned in and is on your desk for approval
what did i think of it
an african american man steps off the curb letting franklin and louis pass
you had some problems with it
i better read it
steel workers tend to vote democratic
lunch with secretary daniels
hes your boss
a beat what if shed said yes
louis shoots him a look that says you know who
its time to stop
i can handle my own affairs louis
not this one
this is washington d
not the harvard club
off put by franklins arrogance how can you be so cavalier
you say that like its a bad thing
louis takes a quick last drag on his cigarette and follows him inside a building
a large grandfather clock reads
the sound of a key in the front door turns and franklin quietly enters
his hair is a mess and his clothing is slightly askew
as he comes through the hall two eyes shine in the darkness
they belong to eleanor sitting rigidly on a settee listening to the sound of franklins footsteps going up the stairs
franklin goes into his bedroom
eleanor quietly comes up the stairs and stops for a brief moment by franklins door then goes off to her bedroom closing the door behind her
franklin lays sleeping in his bed as eleanor enters quietly so as not to wake him
carefully she picks up a set of keys on the dresser then turns and notices a packet of letters sitting on top of an open duffle bag
tentatively she reaches for them
she brings the packet tied with a piece of ribbon up to her nose
she is shocked by their familiar scent
with trembling hands she unties the ribbon
tears flood down her cheeks as she reads
franklin opens his eyes
springwood is the three story roosevelt mansion
it is surrounded by a thousand acres of forests fields bridal paths and a glorious view of the hudson river
the five roosevelt children are screaming on the front lawn playing a boisterous game of croquet
sara roosevelt sits at the head of the table
she is one for whom the expression grande dame was coined
franklin is at the opposite end of the table looking pale
louis as always is by his side
eleanor like a prisoner who has accepted her fate sits across from them calm and composed
i have offered franklin his freedom
and i have accepted
to eleanor his freedom is not yours to offer
i am in love with miss mercer mama
lord save us from fools in love
falling in love is out of the question
why do you think men have mistresses
duty to their families and their careers
eleanor rises from the table
where do you think youre going
its obvious that my input in this matter is of little importance
she begins to exit the room but franklin is up like a shot
come back here
both of you
franklin chases eleanor
midway up the stairs she turns
i dont know whether to hate you or thank you
for forcing me to face my life honestly for the first time
i didnt mean to hurt you babs
you never do
you live your life skimming the surface
never aware of the attachments beneath
finding her anger it must be a luxury
she goes up the stairs without looking back
franklin slowly walks back into the room
divorce will finish your career in politics
how do you intend to support yourself
my trust fund
divorce eleanor and there is no trust fund
franklin turns away
he looks out the large picture window and attempts to light a cigarette but his hands shake
weve come so far boss
state assembly assistant secretary of the navy all pages right out of cousin teddys play book
were on the road to the white house
dont do this
franklin sees his son elliot playing separately from the rest of his siblings
elliot looks up at his father as franklin bares his best politicians smile at him
a roar begins to fill his ears
it becomes clearer that it is the sound of a crowd cheering
conventioneers shout out franklins name holding up placards emblazoned with franklin bolts running vigorously down the center aisle of the hall lit by the circle of a spotlight
the crowd goes wild over this unconventional entrance
hen he reaches the edge of the stage he leaps onto it
this final act of daring pushes the crowd into frenzy
smiling for no one
breathless i humbly accept your nomination for vice president
the crowd roars back in reaction to his less than humble stance
they say the best way to get rid of a man is to have him run for vice president
he holds for the laugh you might well have asked my cousin teddy if thats how they got rid of him
franklin stands on the stage the music rising the crowd cheering
slowly the sound of the convention fades to something far more delicate
a harp playing in an elegant tea room
the hushed tones of polite conversation wafts through the air
franklin sits with his cousin alice roosevelt daughter of teddy
brilliant and acerbic she would have had a career in politics had she been born a man
of course you lost
a roosevelt on the democratic ticket
our ancestors are turning in their graves
cousin alice if teddy were alive hed be a democrat and you know it
but i do know one thing youre exactly like him
my father was born wanting only one thing to be president
and whats wrong with that
they both share a laugh
do you know what theyre saying about you
franklins smile fades
no but im sure youll tell me
they say f
stands for featherduster
that youre a lightweight
a dilettante with no substance no point of view
is that what you think
you lead with your vanity
you talk when you should listen
unless these are the qualities of a democrat
the democratic party is the party of the people
i am a man of the people
darling youre a roosevelt
what do you know about people
she leans in conspiratorially
of course i can think of one person you did manage to find the time to invest in
a miss mercer i believe
dont misunderstand me franklin
being married to eleanor i think you deserved some fun
but you made the right decision
especially since miss mercer has gone on with her life
what are you talking about
edward rutherford is a wonderful catch for a girl like her
stunned shes married
a small event of course
when i last heard she was governess to his children
with a smile and then love bloomed
as a man of the people i wouldnt be too hard on her franklin
we cant all have trust funds you know
franklin louis and a photographer disembark from a touring car
were not taking this defeat lying down boss
well run you for governor
of which state
louis shoots him a look
no this buys you time
it buys you experience
what about al smith
youre still a fresh face boss
well use that to our advantage
they walk down a hill towards some waiting boy scouts as the photographer follows them
boy scouts louis
hardly my political base
theyve got parents
besides theyre photogenic
franklin begins glad handing the assembled group of mostly underprivileged children
franklin roosevelt happy to meet you
franklin masks his thinly veiled discomfort with an artificial good cheer
meanwhile louis in full political mode makes sure the l photographer gets everything
franklin poses with two scouts
the picture is taken
okay boys lunch
line up to wash
to franklin will you be joining us
franklin steps into a line before a large communal water barrel and glances sideways at guiseppe an immigrant child of the city streets
he wears his uniform proudly and smiles at franklin
whats your name son
franklin puts his arm around guiseppe forcing the moment between them
he waits patiently as the cameras click away
come sta ragazzo
puzzled okay i guess
the scouts begin washing their hands together in the water barrel and franklin joins in as louis looks on admiringly
as guiseppe splashes some of the water on his face franklin not to be outdone does so as well
its all for the cameras
a large but unpretentious house with a sweeping lawn that looks out over the icy waters of the bay of fundy
eleanor sits quietly on the front porch knitting in a world of her own
a few feet away also in a world of his own sits louis overdressed for summer in a three piece suit
an overflowing ashtray is by his side and piles of newspaper lie at his feet
he holds up a paper to eleanor with the photo of franklin and the boy scouts
hes a natural
eleanor gives it a cursory glance then looks out to where franklin and the children come bounding up the lawn
franklin and elliot break out from the rest and begin racing up the lawn
franklin no match for his sons speed loses
he doubles over trying to catch his breath
woe to the conquered
aught up in his victory elliot doesnt see franklin sneak up behind him and tackle him to the ground
not so fast
one by one the other children all pile on top of franklin and elliot
dinner is in one half hour
come in and change children
you heard your mother
everyone runs up the porch stairs and into the house except franklin
go wash up
utterly spent franklin lays on the grass not moving
are you all right
slowly franklin gets up and walks with great effort up the porch stairs
re her knitting oh thats pretty babs
he puts his hand on eleanors shoulder and leans in to buss her cheek but eleanor quickly stands
i must check on dinner
there is a cursory formality to her words and little warmth
she goes into the house
louis then hands franklin letters
wearily he sorts through the envelopes
why dont you nap before dinner
franklin heads into the house leaning heavily against the screen door struggling for control
franklin lays on a chaise being examined by a doctor who leans over him holding out his hand
can you take my hand
franklin tries but cant
almost his entire body is paralyzed
he can only breathe and blink
the doctor glances at eleanor louis and sara indicating they should follow him out
as the door from the sun room opens onto the porch elliot is there waiting
seeing them coming he dashes off into the yard so as not to be seen as eleanor louis sara and the doctor enter
he has infantile paralysis
sara sinks into a chair
i knew it
i knew it
thought it only struck children
how did he get it
some experts believe it is linked to contaminated water
but that theory is speculative at best
it was the visit to that god damned boy scout camp
in all honesty you need to be looking forward not back
what is the prognosis
the damage to his leg muscles is extensive
i suspect he will be paralyzed from the waist down
beat and the children
if they dont have any symptoms by now then they have been spared
sara stands her bearing once again erect and proud
then we must count our blessings
you will need to prepare yourselves
there is a deep depression that follows an illness of this magnitude
im afraid life as he knew it is over
their discussion is suddenly interrupted by the sound of a child crying
eleanor rushes off the porch to the bushes
eleanor finds elliot having heard everything curled up in a ball weeping
she leans down and wraps her arms around him
a pink background covered in small white flowers with red centers and green leaves
there is a seam in the paper
a tiny white spot where glue has soaked through
pull back to reveal franklin in bed
this is all he stares at hour after hour after hour
his lips are dry
a glass of water sits tantalizingly on the night stand
he reaches for it but its a few inches out of his reach
slowly he begins to rock his torso back and forth
sara eleanor and louis are in heated conversation
now that politics are out of the question he can stay here at home with me
but what kind of life is that
ive rented him an office downtown
he can still practice law
why would you want to do that
because he needs it
he can pursue a career mama
a man as proud and vital as franklin
youre inviting him to be hurt
and you mr
ra contd sa howe engaged in the fantasy of a political future for my son
is there nothing you wont do to keep your job
sara leaves as eleanor goes after her
thats not fair
franklin still rocking his torso has now gained some momentum managing to have moved just a few inches
sara busies herself arranging flowers
what kind of life is it to be pitied and stared at
what kind of life is it to be hidden away
i know you believe that what you are suggesting for franklin is best
but i think you are making it harder for him
i think i know whats best for franklin
i am his mother
and i am his wife
sara stares at eleanor in disbelief
eleanor stares back unflinching
franklin reaches his arm towards the glass only to fall from the bed to the floor with a thud
frustrated beyond words franklin lunges at his wheelchair and shoves it across the floor letting out an anguished cry
in agony from both the pain and the humiliation he stares up and fixes his gaze on the ornate ceiling overhead
then closing his eyes a pounding in his head starts to get louder and louder
franklin on his back his face and body drenched with sweat is asleep in his bunk in the boat
he awakens to the sound of the pounding
voices are calling him accompanied by fists smashing at the door
he opens his eyes and is disoriented
he tries to sit up momentarily forgetting that he cant
e lifts the sheet and visibly winces in disgust at the sight of his crippled legs
bones covered by flesh with barely an ounce of muscle
finally the door bursts open
two young crewman eugene and stanley enter
roosevelt we got a storm comin
he lifts franklin over his shoulder
stanley grabs clothes and pulls a set of long iron leg braces from a hook off the wall
eugene grabs a bucket and holds franklin up to urinate
while peeing leave me here
let the ocean swallow me up
burial at sea
perfect for a navy man
stripped to his underwear franklin is laid across the bunk
eugene kneels and puts on franklins socks and shoes
then he and stanley slide on his braces and pants
their hands zipper clasp buckle and tie
each hand works in synchronicity with the other
clumsily they lift franklin up struggling under his weight
eugene and stanley carry franklin off in the driving rain
kerosene lamps light the diner which is filled with people mostly fishermen seeking refuge from the coming storm
franklin soaked to the skin and wrapped in a blanket is being pushed through the door by eugene in a wheelchair
the restaurant collectively pauses to take them
franklin is slowly wheeled across the restaurant
he shrinks from the stares of the patrons
a little girl eating with her parents gets excited when she sees franklins braces and points
franklin gives her a hard look and she is hurt
what he cant see is that under the table she wears a set of braces like his
franklin is wheeled up to his table and eugene and stanley sit down with him
louis enters resembling a drowned rat
he rips off his hat and raincoat and puts down his suitcase
genuinely surprised louis
i never miss florida in the rainy season
would you have answered it
what the hell are you doing here
good to see you too
you look like chester arthur
stanley this is mr
he gets sea sick at the mere sight of a boat so hes probably happy that its being ldestroyed right now
boys i need to talk to mr
find your own breakfast
heres a five spot
make it a feast
they look at the money and take their leave
youre always so generous with my money
you mean your mothers dont you
the waitress puts down two cups of coffee
franklin pulls out a flask and pours some into his cup
he then lights a cigarette and begins smoking but doesnt offer one to louis
without asking louis helps himself
so mama financed this fools errand has she
well its a waste of a trip
it was eleanors idea
franklins face is immobile
what can i get you
id like some ham and eggs sunny side up please
to franklin whats your fancy boss
i fancy nothing
hell have the same
the waitress grabs their menus and scurries away
louis opens his briefcase and hands franklin a stack of mail
franklin glances it but doesnt open any
there are a few from your children
i can still read
franklin flips through the mail and finds a letter that interests him opening it
your wife wants you to come home
choosing his words shes concerned
this life on a boat
where is it getting you
for one thing no one gets to see me and i dont get to see them
dont say that
everyones waiting for you to come home
theyre aching to see you
louis looks sadly at his friend
skimming the letter from george foster peabody
he owns a resort in rural georgia for investment purposes
hot springs or something
he claims that only recently a crippled boy swam in the waters and can walk again
oh for chrissake
reading the high magnesium content of these natural springs will hold anyone up
although it is not a resort for infirm types i am extending you my personal invitation to come visit in the off season
putting the letter aside im only welcome in the off season
eugene and stanley approach the table
roosevelt we got bad news
its the boat
it got banged up real bad tied to the dock
i dont think you can stay there anymore
ranklin absorbs this
maybe its a blessing in disguise mr
i dont know about you but im homesick
and im sick of home
to louis wheres the letter from peabody
you cant be serious
he hands franklin the letter who rereads it
why not miracle waters
ive drunk the oil of monkey glands been zapped with electricity and hung upside down in harnesses
after all that this sounds downright peaceful
i cant quite picture you in the back woods of georgia
where do you picture me louis
i cant visit the bathroom without a team of associates to help pull my pants down
give it a little time
theres a reason they say a man runs for office
a beat im going to georgia
franklin and eleanor sit next to one another
franklin is now shaved and cleaned up considerably
however the tension between them is palpable
eleanor knits furiously while talking
franklin looks out the window at african american field hands hard at work in the red clay hills of georgia
james has been doing so much better now that elliot has joined him at groton
theyve put their differences behind them and have become a real team
franklin observes two young boys african american running alongside the slow moving train
two peas in a pod
last week they were both in the infirmary with the f same cold
ranklin eyes a wagon pulled by a mule
the driver a farmer takes off his hat and wipes his brow in the hot sun
meanwhile any suggestion i make to anna for her future she dismisses me
i am going to have to enlist your support in this franklin
she listens to you
she looks over at franklin and sees that he is staring out the window deep in thought not having heard a word shes said
tom loyless stands waiting by a car dressed in a white suit
laconic with a dry sense of humor tom is a man of few words whose poker face hides a true desperation
he holds a telegram from franklin in his hand
as the train pulls in tom looks for franklin among the passengers making their exit
there are two different exits on the platform clearly marked white and colored
whites exit from the front of the train and blacks from the rear
lionel purdy tiny and dressed in a mailmans uniform approaches tom
of indeterminate age and dubious intellect his mail bag is almost as big as he is
you might say so lionel
patiently no hes dead
the stationmaster approaches
tom your guest needs some assistance
were gonna need some able bodied men to move him
to lionel go over to the livery stable
and get the collier boys
franklin exits the train slung in a firemans carry over the shoulder of roy collier african american
his brother pete is close behind carrying luggage both hover at around
franklin attempts to hide his embarrassment with good cheer
then youd better call me franklin
still in the firemans carry franklin extends his hand for tom to shake
and this is the misses
call me eleanor
pleased to make your acquaintance
roy then carries him over to toms car and gingerly places him inside
to tom theres a trunk and a chair with the wheels too
ill send a wagon right over
we got a wagon sir
tom drives franklin in front eleanor sits in the back
pine trees tower over the sides of the dirt road
in occasional clearings franklin spies barefoot children playing out in front of broken down shacks
they stop their play to look at the car
covering his discomfort beautiful country
how long have you been manager of the inn
they bang over a large pothole
they all fly up and land hard
got any paved roads
no we dont
toms car turns into a driveway
franklin has a brochure for the meriwether inn opened in his lap
he tries to spy the building through the trees but cannot
he looks back at the brochure
the picture is of a lavish victorian hotel and the words our renowned mineral hot springs can cure whatever ails you
franklin looks up and sees a three story hideous green and yellow monstrosity leaning slightly to one side
paint is peeling everywhere
what once were flower beds are overgrown with weeds
the car pulls to a stop
youll have a great deal of privacy
there are only a few guests right now as its the off season
im hoping to make some improvements by next spring franklin puts out his arm preventing tom from getting out of the car
i cant stay here
this place is a wreck
look on the bright side
most of your time will be spent in the water
a beat its true weve fallen on some hard times
this is a disaster
it should be condemned
toms southern manners are being put to the test but he stays remarkably calm
yes weve seen better days
a beat but then i imagine so have you
franklin blinks incomprehensibly at tom and what he has just said
im happy to drive you back to the train station right now if thats what you want
they lock eyes
franklin wonders if toms bluffing but he cant tell
in a low voice fire
im frightened of fire
i cant get out if im upstairs
weve got options
toms car is now parked in front of a group of small cottages
roy and petes horse drawn wagon is behind it
tom and pete open a set of shutters over the windows of a tiny cottage
franklin and eleanor sit in the car watching
sheets cover the furniture cobwebs span the beams and dust particles fill the air
as tom maneuvers the wheelchair through the front door franklin notices a broken window
caustic well ventilated at least
roy enters with a suitcase
where do you want this mr
the bedroom roy thank you
he looks after roy as he exits
tom this young man appears quite competent
would you ask him if hed like to stay on as my valet
politely why dont you ask him yourself
he tips his hat and goes outside
pete alone drives the wagon past the inn and out onto the road
eleanor stands in the middle of the tiny living room stunned by the squalor
she speaks to franklin who is changing in the other room
this is madness
tell me again franklin why are we here
franklin is wheeled out by roy now changed into a bathing suit
for the waters
are you coming
roy wheels franklin while tom walks in front of them leading the way
roosevelt want to swim
roosevelt doesnt know how
franklin takes in the surroundings
deserted horse stables in total ruin and tennis courts covered with underbrush mar the landscape
an immense t shaped pool rimmed in concrete
the bluish water is clear and sparkling and a delicate steam rises out of the warmth
mother eyeing franklin approaching in his wheelchair comes to the edge of the pool and coaxes her children out of the water
aunt sally an ancient gaunt african american woman stands guard by the edge of the water
roosevelt id like you to meet aunt sally
good day sir
i have towels for you
roy wheels franklin as close to the rim of the pool as possible
tom lends his assistance and both he and roy hoist franklin out of the chair and place him at the edge letting his feet dangle in the warm water
twisting on his massive arms franklin lowers himself cautiously
now give it a minute
youll see that the mineralization makes the water more buoyant
the crippled boy who swam here was actually able to walk in the water
franklins legs flop as his useless feet touch the shallow bottom
crushed all hope drains from his face
i cant even stand
well not yet
roy sleeps on a couch on the front porch
eleanor tosses and turns on a roll away bed
franklin lies in bed staring up at the ceiling
a handful of guests are spread out in a huge dining room
franklin and eleanor sit together
he is eating heartily but eleanor merely moves her food around
this is simply revolting
its not very good but it is mysterious
holding out his plate what in the world do you think theyve poured over this chicken
or is it possum
eleanor sizes franklin up
she knows this is a preamble
you want to stay
new york has the best doctors and hospitals in the country
i need something new
this isnt about getting better is it
you dont want to come home
you dont want to live with us
i refuse to be a burden to anyone
youre not a burden youre my husband
e reaches out and takes her hand in his
i want to offer you the freedom you once so generously offered me
she pulls it away all youve ever known is duty
to me and to a political career that unless i can walk no longer exists
youve been exemplary
now im telling you youre free to go
her voice rising no
a beat i dont want freedom
i want a marriage
i want a life with you
franklin wont let himself believe it
i cant imagine what you think that life is going to be
this takes the wind out of eleanor
its not up to me to imagine its up to you
eleanor folds her napkin and gets up from the table
pete helps eleanor into his livery wagon
franklin watches from the porch as eleanor rides away
her suitcase slides across the open wagon bed as the wagon makes the tight turn from the driveway onto the main road
looking out straight ahead
alone and scared as he watches the wagon fade from sight
eleanor is pouring tea for louis who is seated
thank you for stopping by mr
i thought you might want to see a friendly face
off the silence so hows our boy doing
well hes enjoying the waters very much
suddenly overwhelmed i think weve lost him
her pent up tears burst in a free flow
louis leads her to a nearby settee and hands her his handkerchief
please excuse me mr
dont you think its time you called me louis
maybe weve been going about this all wrong
hes down there to be alone so lets give him what he wants
we change our focus
louis smiles knowingly
the row of abandoned cottages look strangely pretty aglow in the setting sun
franklin is seated on the ramshackle porch in his chair
his cigarette hangs from his lip as he mixes martinis in a glass milk bottle
he pours one for tom then himself
to your mineral pool or whatever you call it
they clink their glasses
tom takes a polite sip then chokes back the bad taste
havent been in a drinking mood lately
actually its the most god awful martini ive ever tasted
are you always this direct tom
well i never tasted a martini this bad before
franklin takes another sip checking
it tastes fine to him
hurt everyone likes my martinis
so they say
franklins bed is already empty
aunt sally is seated talking with roy while franklin lies on his back in the water swimming
all his movement comes from his shoulders and arms
the morning sun streams down on him
tom sits off to one side reading the newspaper
tell me more about what that boy did aunt sally
well first hed always swim over to the side of the pool and hold himself there make sure he righted himself
before he knew it
hed be standing
if it was only that easy
well you make it hard
get over to the side of that pool and grab it
humoring her yes maam
now you got to remember how you did it
franklin holds the edge of the pool closing his eyes
for a long moment there is silence
almost without realizing it franklin lets go of the edge of the pool
when he opens his eyes he is standing all by himself in the water
a nervous laugh im standing
his laughter gets stronger
tom aunt sally and roy look on
the release is powerful as franklin dissolves into tears
tom whos been mixing cocktails hands franklin a drink and lifts his glass
to standing on your own two feet
they clink and drink
this water could be the cure the cure
in six months i could be up and walking
lionel the mailman comes down the path carrying a flashlight reading an open letter
im working for the federal government
all the more reason
shoving a drink at him sort of late for the mail isnt it
not for me it isnt
got a whole packet of clippings for you mr
from a mr
new york times journal american
dont know what else
he hands an already opened letter to franklin
your mother wants to know when youre coming home
she says they got swimming pools in hyde park
shes mad as all hell
reading other peoples mail is not only impolite its illegal
sheriff dont mind
he likes i read his mail
saves him the time
plus a lot of folks around here cant read so its more a public service really
thank you lionel
he hands lionel a letter
reading miss missy lehand
if you must know shes my social secretary
to tom im having her come down
lionel reaches into his bag
your wife wrote the nicest letter
shes gonna make a speech at the league of women voters
give me that
he hands the letter to franklin who immediately begins reading
to tom says shes gonna keep the roosevelt name alive
least till he starts walkin and all
lionel takes the letter franklin just handed him opens it flicks his flashlight back on and continues on his way
studying the letter this is so unlike eleanor
shes terrified of crowds
louis and eleanor approach a set of double doors
we are facing imminent disaster
i take full responsibility if you hyperventilate or faint
they enter the room
at a lectern behind which a banner reads league of women voters the chairwoman sees them and waves them forward
ah here she is now
a small crowd of about two dozen women offer up polite but scant applause for eleanor
i am so pleased to be invited here today
looking down at her cards too often
a photographer snaps a picture which throws eleanor off
the pause is deadly
louis looks ready to jump out a window
eleanor continues her voice still pitched too high
too often the great decisions are originated and given form in bodies made up wholly of men
slowly she begins to find her voice
so that whatever political value women have to offer is shunted aside
his is a mistake
she looks up from her cards and stares at the audience
and for the first time speaks spontaneously
i think this might be the reason i am having such a difficult time giving voice to my own thoughts here today
the immediacy of her self effacing comment charms the room
im reminded of what someone once said about looking at an elephant
that it is impossible to ever see an entire elephant from one place you must walk around it
if our elected leaders are to be truly effective then they must be willing to go out of their way to look beyond what is right in front of them
to see the entire elephant
and for that
they need our help
the ladies applaud her much to her relief
at a reception following the speech eleanor and the chairwoman are drinking tea
that was so moving mrs
the child welfare amendment could use someone with your passion
you must consider being our spokesperson
eleanor looks to louis who nods
it would be an honor
franklin is attempting to walk in the water working diligently
tom watches him from a few paces back
i walked five steps today
listen franklin i got word a local reporter wants to do a story on you
im hardly newsworthy these days
a beat how did he find out im here
small town word gets out
it probably wont amount to more than a provincial puff piece but it might give us some free publicity for the inn
franklin looks at tom knowing full well hes arranged this
all right i know the gentleman
im doing him a favor
you know i used to be a journalist
do you mean all this time ive been talking to a newspaper man
i got in a bit of trouble in atlanta
seems some of the editorial pieces i wrote offended the sensibilities of a local civic group
so i needed to lay low for a while
a beat you mean the klan
good god tom
george foster peabody gave me this job
well that explains a few things
for the life of me i couldnt figure out why someone like you was running this rat trap
laughing swimming off i was going to say dump but rat trap fits nicely
franklin is seated but not in his wheelchair
he wears long pants even though its blisteringly hot
cleburne gregory sits across from franklin a second string reporter in a three piece suit
now in when you were running for vice president
i cant imagine your readers are interested in ancient history
cox and i lost the election by a wide margin
it was only a few years ago mr
now its the waters extra minerals plus its warmth that makes all the difference
at degrees i can work my muscles for hours and not get cold
as assistant secretary of the navy during the great war did you condone the use of
i forgot one more thing you will need to write down
poor circulation is a chronic problem for people in my condition
gregory looks at franklin
its clear hes not going to get the interview he came for
you think it could be a cure
i dont know
but youre hopeful
franklin is laid out on the bed as roy slides the braces off his legs
roy unlaces his shoes and slips them off his feet
e is about to put them under the bed when franklin motions for roy to hand them to him
still flat on his back franklin luxuriates in the rich leather cobbled by hand
he examines their smooth immaculate soles
worn but never walked in
a newspaper clipping of eleanor in her speech to the league is taped to the wall
we hear the sound of an underwood typewriter clacking away and franklins voice dictating
therefore a formal questionnaire should be composed in order so we may hear from all recent delegates as to how we can do better in to present a more united
signed franklin roosevelt etc
missy le hand is sitting at a card table typing
brunette with some early gray she is sturdy in build with a plain but friendly face
do you want this out today
f tomorrow will be fine
thank you missy and c
that to louis
missy rises with a stack of envelopes and heads out
roy enters with a plate of pancakes in front of franklin
who do you write to every morning
different people i knew in politics
just in case they ever want me back
so youll be ready when you get your legs workin again
there is a knock at the screen door
an earnest young man benjamin prendergast is peering in
he has a newspaper
excuse me are you mr
who are you
roy opens the door to prendergast who enters
my name is benjamin prendergast
ive come to see if you could speak at this years graduation ceremony at the schoolhouse
you being so famous and all
prendergast unfolds the newspaper
there is a picture of franklin under the heading franklin roosevelt swims his way ill be damned
would you be available
looking up when
we only have a four month school year
how is that possible
tax dollars only cover that much
are you graduating
im the principal
but franklin doesnt see
a small breeze or a decent rain would knock it to the ground
a bookshelf with four books
a few farmers and their wives sit with large groups of filthy children
they look at franklin askance
prendergast stands proudly beside three graduates to be
tom stands in the back observing
franklin in his wheelchair sits uncomfortably before the gathering
he notices a father staring at his legs
now that were all here let me introduce to you to our guest speaker today mr
a fly begins buzzing around his head
he laughs derisively almost to himself
at groton where i graduated from high school our beloved headmaster encouraged his students to enter public life
he looks up and catches the glazed eyes of an undernourished child which unsettles him
i chose to attend harvard for my undergraduate work and then columbia for my law degree
e takes in their uncomprehending expressions
i followed my headmasters advice and sought a career in public life
but circumstances beyond my control have made that
he stares at his tiny audience all of whom know something about circumstances beyond their control
ive given many speeches in my life
i dont know why im having such a hard time making this one
horrified and unable to speak franklin seems temporarily lost but the tiny audience doesnt seem to notice
they just see franklin
my god did you see how they were looking at me
they welcomed your company franklin
dont patronize me
tom is losing his patience
dont patronize them
these people go to bed night after night with half empty stomachs your legs are the least of their worries
they continue to drive in silence
its a cold day and franklin is swimming in the pool
roy is wearing a sweater
aunt sally is there too wearing a patched up coat with a scarf around her neck
tom is nearby raking leaves
roosevelt arent you cold
roosevelt youre gonna catch the chill if you dont get out of the water
franklin ignores them and dips under the water as tom comes over
you got to tell him mr
he wont listen to us
franklin comes up from under
franklin we need to talk
normally we close up this time of year and the staff goes home for the holidays
franklin looks at tom then at roy and aunt sally acknowledging
the sound of a train whistle is heard
the whistle is coming from a model train as it zooms around a track set up on a table in the roosevelt living room
elliot now is mesmerized
sara sits at a piano between franklin jr
they are finishing a rousing rendition of angels we have heard on high as an enormous christmas tree gets decorated
james is at the top of a ladder while his sister anna decorates from the lowest rung
eleanor holds up a tiny porcelain ornament to anna
grandmother delano brought this from china
franklin working from his wheelchair is filling out the lower branches of the tree his lap filled with ornaments
have you ever been to china father
just your grandmama
i adored china
it smelled of ginger cookies
ets go in the backyard and dig our way there
that sounds like an adventure
anna looks over at her father sadly and franklin catches her eye
she quickly looks away
from behind his back john pulls out the christmas star and places it on his fathers knee
put it on top
silence descends over the room
no one dares to breathe
give it to james
hes the tallest
john give it to him
papa always does it
i can do it
franklin tosses the star in an attempt to reach the top
it almost catches but it falls to the floor
quickly aiding to avoid his fathers embarrassment james climbs back up and puts the star on top
sara sensing the awkwardness of the moment begins to play and sing an overly cheery rendition of hark
the herald angels sing
roy is spotting franklin as he pulls himself along a set of parallel bars
eleanor observes as franklin uses his arms to drag his legs behind him
it was an extraordinary turnout this afternoon
louis says there were over two hundred people in the audience
thats marvelous babs
eleanor is flushed with pride
franklin catching her look slips slightly on the bars as roy grabs hold of him
ive got you sir
franklin then takes note that eleanors expression has turned to one of pure heartbreak
you wonder why i want to go back to georgia
its to avoid people who look at me the way you just did
you truly believe the waters
with difficulty that they are helping
dont talk to me as if i were a child
choosing your words so carefully
how am i supposed to talk to you
like i was
talk to me like i was
roy turns franklin around on the bars and they begin walking away from eleanor
i dont know how anymore
franklin is being lifted out of petes wagon by roy and placed into his wheelchair
he sees tom approaching
youre a sight for sore eyes
we missed you at the station
the smile on franklins face slips to a look of shock as he takes in toms changed appearance
his face is sallow and his trademark white suit is hanging on him
concerned tom are you all right
its just an ulcer
i cant eat anything i like anymore
roy carries the luggage into the cottage
covering my father had ulcers
yes they are
a silence hangs in the air
ready to swim
franklin now dressed in his bathing suit is being wheeled by roy
weve got some new guests
some paying some non paying
as they get closer franklin is stunned by what he sees a dozen people all in different groupings some on crutches others in wheelchairs are gathered around the pool
what in blazes
the interview you gave was syndicated in sunday papers all over the country
franklin looks up at tom dumbfounded
theyre here to see you
this news hits franklin with the force of a sledgehammer
pat doyle is stuffed into his wheelchair with a huge cigar between his fat lips
is eyebrows have a life of their own
he wheels himself to franklin
roosevelt pat doyle
ive come all the way from minneapolis to shake your hand sir
he reaches out his hand to franklin
stuck in this chair i do nothing but read
usually im just looking for something anything thatll tell me theres even the slightest chance ill walk again
franklin is uncomfortable especially as pat wont let go of his hand
i really dont know what to say
well youre here
and were here
well think of something
franklin looks to tom and gestures for him to come closer
whispering get me out of here
franklin is pushing the chair himself along the dirt path his anger propelling f him away from tom
i want no part of this
i come here for privacy
this isnt your personal spa
i have a business to run
you have a business to run not i
no ones asking anything of you
of course they are
do you know what it took for most of them to get here
its not my concern
i want to be left alone
my god youre afraid of these people
what youre talking about
you look at them with the same repulsion and pity as everyone else
dont be ridiculous
i resent your trying to you dont want to be around them because then that would make you one of them wouldnt it
franklin furiously wheels himself back towards the cottage getting stuck on the dirt path along the way
god damn it
tom comes to his aid but he is brushed off by franklin
out of my way
get out of my goddamn way
franklin wheels himself off
franklin in his wheelchair smokes a cigarette
his bags are next to him as is roy
a trains whistle blows and pulls in
right on time
franklin sees someone else on the platform
he squints in the distance
he walks closer towards franklin and roy
franklin nods in toms general direction
tom has a telegram in his hand which peaks franklins curiosity
the train comes to a complete stop
a conductor steps out onto the platform
a single elderly woman gets off the train
to the conductor im looking for a young gentleman by the name of botts
dont know anything about that
i expect he would be in a wheelchair
you mean the cripple
hes in the baggage car
tom franklin and roy are in front of the large door as the conductor pushes it back slowly
amongst crates and luggage is fred botts a young man of fifteen lying on the floor unconscious
a wheelchair is next to him turned over on its side
mother of god
tom leaps up and into the car as does roy leaving franklin below
tom takes his wrist
his pulse is slow
roy lays fred on a bench
franklin wheels himself over
son can you hear me
tom brings a cup of water
franklin puts it to freds lips
fred opens his eyes
they are large and brown with a sweetness to them
his face comes alive when he recognizes franklin
its going to be all right son
e hands franklin a worn newspaper clipping from his pocket
the headline reads franklin roosevelt swims his way to health
the conductor wouldnt let me ride in the passenger car with my chair
franklin looks at the clipping then at fred
when did you last eat
knoxville had to be three days ago
roy take him to the car
as roy lifts fred in his arms franklin wheels himself to the engine car
tom follows as they approach the conductor
who in their right mind lets a child ride in the baggage car
you could have killed that boy
he had polio
probably still contagious
the conductor walks away dismissively
franklin pushes his chair up and stops the conductor in his tracks
dont dismiss me because i sit in this chair
get away from me
franklin pushes the wheels of his chair with such force he knocks the conductor over
you ignorant son of a bitch
if i could id get up right now and lock you in that box car
see how you like it
the conductor struggles to get up
get this lunatic off me
franklin wheels himself towards toms car where fred is now lying across the back seat
the sight of fred drains all anger from franklins face
wheres the nearest hospital
what about a doctor
closer but not by much
the train whistle blows
franklin looks at fred then at roy and tom
quietly lets go home
fred lays in franklins bed while franklin sits by the bedside
roy lays a cold compress on freds forehead
ranklin is using his watch to take freds pulse
roy pulls back the sheet to give fred air revealing his withered legs
alabaster skin stretched over bones
franklin looks away
franklin sits at a card table with his check book in front of him
tom stands before him shifting uncomfortably
how many can pay
fewer than half
franklin opens the check book and begins writing
i want these people in the cottages not in the inn
well its the way it has to be
what do you mean
ive already had some complaints
awkwardly this is the start of the season franklin
ive got regulars who have come for years
healthy folks over all
theyre threatening to check out afraid they might catch polio
dont they know that after the fever breaks we are no longer contagious
im going to have to ask that you not use the pool during regular hours
ill put time aside for you late in the day
and it wont be possible for you to eat in the dining room either
but i promise ill find someplace suitable
they dont want us to eat in their presence
of course for you i can make other accommodations
a beat that wont be necessary
franklin goes back to writing out the check
tom stands waiting the sound of the pen scratching seemingly interminable
their mutual discomfort is obvious
franklin rips the check from the ledger and holds it for tom
we still need a doctor here
pointedly for everyone
franklin is in his wheelchair writing
dear babs things are very different upon my return
eleanor sits in a chair reading franklins letter
i am taking on responsibilities which none of my schooling in the spheres of higher learning or politics could have prepared me for
i have seen the casualties of war
but i have never seen this a suffering so insidious so silent that it rattles my soul
franklin is tucking fred in for the night
when can i swim
when youre a little stronger
when im asleep in my dreams i can still walk
a beat how long has it been
since you walked
id just learned to ride a bike
after i got sick my mom was sure that the bike had caused it
did she sell it
she took it out back and shot it
franklin howls with laughter joined by fred
franklin is in the pool with the new guests
they are all nervously waiting to test the water
from the looks on their faces its clear they only want to take their cues from franklin
a mother carries her adorable year old girl into the water
and who is this delightful child
all right daisy try and kick your legs
daisy wiggles back and forth in her mothers arms giving it her very best effort
jake perrini bronx born with an upper body of steel wheels over to roy who is fixing a wheelchair
jake perrini bronx new york
how you doin
jake reaches out his hand to shake
roy is unsure what to do
cmon i wont bite
shaking his hand mighty fine sir
hey would you mind pulling me outta this trap roy
i wanna get airborne
roy gently lifts jake up and out of his chair into his arms like a child
do me one more favor
throw me in
roy tosses jake to the heavens and he sails through the air emitting a jungle cry of pure emotional release before splashing down hard in the water
e bobs up to the surface
there is applause
now folks these exercises are of my own devising so bear with me
some laugh some are confused
this is new territory for everyone
my hope is that in repeating these movements over and over in the water im in some way causing the muscles to regenerate themselves and repair the damage
he swims to the edge of the pool
so everybody grab the edge of the pool and move what you can
hey disperse eagerly ready to do what franklin tells them
go ahead now do your best
their legs barely rise up to splash the surface
undeterred franklin leads them on spiritedly
in the distance we see tom leaning against a tree watching everything
tom oversees the dinner service of paying guests none of whom have disabilities
segregated in a back room all the polio guests are gathered for dinner seated around a couple of sawhorses with old doors thrown across them serving as makeshift dining tables
roy carries daisy in and places her in the chair next to franklin
do you have a reservation
she begins to giggle
its infectious and soon everyone has a smile on their face overriding the awkwardness of the situation
whether in here or our there i guarantee you the food will taste the same
shouldnt we pray first
by all means
would you do us the honor
franklin bows his head for grace
bless the food on our table
keep us healthy strong and able
with louis in tow eleanor is touring the exterior of an ironworks factory
she is the only woman in a large gathering of men
my dear franklin i too am embarking on an altogether remarkable experience
leanor stands against a banner that reads child welfare league
she is passing out pamphlets to a small crowd that has gathered
it seems everywhere i go there are more people in dire need of help
it would be overwhelming if not for my deep belief that help is possible
eleanor is being introduced by louis to members of the new york state assembly all men eager to shake her hand
louiss latest flash of brilliance is to take me mainstream
he said that you would know what he means by this
franklin is in the water
roy lifts fred out of his wheelchair and gently puts him in the shallow end
franklin receives him
freds face is ecstatic as he floats on his back in the water
i hope you are finding your work to be gratifying in both mind and heart
your beloved eleanor
a very old car comes coughing in steam hissing from its engine
helena mahoney gets out of the drivers seat
her iron will is matched only by her deep reserves of empathy
she gets a good look at the inn
this is what she has come for
franklin and roy having finished lunch are playing checkers
fred is sitting nearby eating a piece of pie
roy pulls off a triple jump
franklin reluctantly tops roys checker
youre losing doc
im sorry youre franklin roosevelt arent you
suspiciously are you a lawyer
then roosevelt it is
he jumps one of roys checkers
im helena mahoney
im a physical therapist
off their blank looks you have no idea who i am do you
i wrote you a letter right after i saw the article in the paper
didnt you read it
it got read i assure you
but probably not by me
helena glances down at the checkerboard and points to it
to roy hes open right there
he sure is
roy trounces franklin with three swift moves
thank you maam
helena sits at the table with them
ive been studying the effects of moist heat on polio patients and i think with repeated exercise in warm water
it can help them regain lost strength
incredibly ive come to the same conclusion myself
a half smile well youre the doctor
helena is wheeling franklin around the grounds
no ramps no running water no doctors
from the article in the newspaper i assumed this was a rehabilitation center
dont believe everything you read
i feel like i was brought here under false pretenses
join the club
franklin lies across a makeshift examining table
helenas examination is in progress
she is completely absorbed all business pouring over his muscles inch by inch
she kneads bends and stretches them with a laser like focus finally picking up franklins leg and rotating it out and around
push against my hand
franklin with difficulty tries to do so
give me the good news first
your gluteus maximus is better than i hoped
it will serve you well
must be all that sitting
your right leg has some movement along the thigh
thats good because we can use it to help extend your hip flex your knee and rotate your tibia
im supposed to walk on one side
the water may help build some strength im not able to see yet
but to do that you would need to swim in the water much of the day
not the limited hours you have now
a beat why should this place cater to a few able bodied folk when it could be opened year round with polios
tom is pushing franklin in his wheelchair
theres a need for a place like this tom
are you aware nklin contd fra that in the last epidemic over people got polio in the new york area alone
sounds like youve been reading up
i wish there was more to read
damn few things being written about any of this
to think of someone like fred
his mind and heart so vibrant
its a waste
an awful waste
franklin takes a beat the weight of this sinking in
whats the acreage here
roughly twelve hundred or so
i want to buy it
i think it would make one hell of an investment
twelve hundred acres
enough for two resorts dont you think
it would take money
theres a lot of land rebuilding the inn adding ramps and so many people cant pay
undeterred do you think old peabody will sell
how can you be so sure
have you taken a look at this place
franklin sits in his chair at a desk
full of charm peabody you old reprobate
how are you
tom is pacing back and forth youll never guess why im calling
helena is training a group of young men how to lift and carry using a raven haired young woman eloise hutchison as the test model
she sits shyly in her wheelchair before them
woodhall this is eloise
lift her gently
woodhall busey has bright red hair and a face full of freckles
over six feet tall he has spent his life working in the fields
w yes maam
he picks eloise up effortlessly then sets her back down
watch her braces
woodhall kneels before eloise like prince charming carefully straightening out her legs
youre light as a
he notices the long jagged scars along eloises wrists
eloise sensing his eyes self consciously pulls down her sleeves
he stares at her questioningly
looking away i was a dancer
tom and franklin come out
franklin gives a questioning look to helena pondering how these boys have suddenly appeared
i raided the pool hall
i call them my push boys
welcome push boys
good day eloise
want to tell them your good news
franklin is smiling like the cat that ate the canary
its hardly a done deal but for better or worse you may be looking at the new owner of this god forsaken place
a free wheeling game of poker
heavy with cigarette and cigar smoke franklin tom fred jake and pat are playing
polios always going to be a losing financial proposition but it doesnt mean you shouldnt buy the place
i am buying it
make no mistake about that
good for you doc
if you dont mind my asking how will people pay for the services you are going to offer here
most people with polio have a hard enough time making ends meet as it is
gently the boy makes a good point franklin
not everything in this world has to be about profits
ill see your twenty five and raise you twenty five
cmon will ya
the nights still young
its twenty five cents not twenty five dollars
dont mind him tom
hes a cheap bastard
fred and pat fold immediately as does franklin
too rich for my blood
to tom fine
heres your twenty five
you better have something
they eyeball each other
gunfight at the o
i was bluffing
gleefully jake slaps his hands together and rakes in the pot
handing franklin a fresh deck your deal doc
gentlemen the game is five card stud sevens are wild
sevens are wild and you can all go to hell
the sun is about to rise
toms car is parked in front of the inn pulled up very close to the main entrance
the trunk is open
tom struggling with a suitcase comes down the ramp
he deposits it in the trunk and then walks precariously back up the ramp having difficulty navigating the incline
he goes back into the house for one last bag
when he comes out hes surprised by what he sees where do you think youre going
franklin is being pushed by roy in his wheelchair
they are both dressed in pajamas and bathrobes though franklin has a blanket around his shoulders to shield him from the morning chill
tom is caught
this is everything he wanted to avoid
going to asheville to see my parents
from the sight of toms car stuffed with luggage it is clear he is not coming back
i cant do this without you
were only just beginning
youre beginning not me
a beat ive got cancer franklin
its spread everywhere
franklin is stunned utterly thrown
ill take you to the best doctors
well go to atlanta right now ive seen the best doctors
when you were in new york they opened me up for the second time
now i just want to die in the bed i was born
franklin is struggling with this
youre going to do great things
this place has an identity now a purpose
it has you
any guard franklin had is gone
he reaches out and takes tom by the sleeve slipping his hand into toms gripping it tightly
take care of yourself roy
god be with you mr
tom takes one last look at franklin
you never pitied me
thank you for that
on the contrary i envy you
i will miss you all the days of my life
tom gets into his car and looks at franklin with a smile
good luck franklin
with a wave he slowly lurches down the long driveway and turns onto the main road
franklin watches the car until it is out of sight
sara paces wildly waving a letter at eleanor and louis
he wants to use his entire trust fund to buy that
franklin has invited louis and me to see the work hes been doing
playing in a pool all day long
squandering his birthright on a group of fawning strangers
i consider this your fault eleanor
i beg your pardon mama
you have indulged him and this is the result
challenging her indulged him
i have indulged him
sara looks away
hes a grown man who makes his own decisions
but he does not need to buy it
if its of any comfort to you i agree
im against it as well
it will consume too much of his time and energy
then it is settled
we tell him no
no it is not settled
we must hear him out
louis and i must see for ourselves the work that he has been doing then we will all discuss this further
a beat nd tell him no
they all look at each other for a moment
for once they agree
perhaps i have underestimated you
perhaps you have
but that has been my fault not yours
fred on crutches swings himself up using one side and then the next under helenas supervision
they are surrounded by many others franklin eloise woodhall pat and jake
the beeping of a car horn gets their immediate attention
roy leaps off the porch skipping the stairs as his brother pete drives up in toms car
he parks it and steps out
peter what are you doing with toms car
i was as sorry as anyone to hear about mr
wished he coulda lived to see this
what are you talking about
loyless had me come up and fetch this right after he brung it to asheville
pete he said take this home and fix it up for mr
i cant drive a car
you can now
roy opens the passenger door and lifts franklin into the drivers seat
get on in and ill teach ya
he begins showing off a system of pulleys and levers that have been attached to both pedals
they thread through holes in a second dashboard attached to polished wood knobs
its a hand controlled automobile
that one there is your brake
and this heres the gas
you got hand controls
that is a thing of beauty
franklin begins running his hands over the polished wood knobs
now you got to push it real smooth or it goes all herky jerky
franklin excitedly turns the key and starts it up
roosevelt youre not ready to drive yet
oh yes i am
franklin hits the gas as the car begins halting and jerking the whole way down the driveway
pete is yelling out instructions but franklin ignores him
they all watch as he pulls away
as the car hits the end of the driveway franklin reaches across pete and opens his passenger door pushing him out
franklin tears off alone out on his first solo spin
ranklin is driving by himself with the top down thrilled to be moving on his own
no one is pushing him
the car covers miles of farmland passing pine forests peach orchards and cotton fields
a spent and anxious eleanor with louis in tow stands on the station platform suitcase in hand
its a far cry from grand central station
they are both silent for a moment
the wire said someone would be here to pick us up
the sounds of tires screeching and a car horn cause them to turn around
it is franklin sitting in the drivers seat of his car
your chariot awaits madame
louis promptly drops the luggage
then he and eleanor walk over to the car taking in the hand controls
when did you learn to drive this thing
franklin drives wild and fast
louis hat flies right off his head
eleanor just holds on
franklin eleanor and louis pull up to the inn
though the brush has been cleared and the trees are newly trimmed its still a wreck
franklin is too proud to concede louis and eleanors disappointment
cant wait to give you the tour
franklin wheels himself along the circular driveway pointing things out almost manic in his energy
a small schoolhouse will go there
we need it badly as many of the children are barred from the local schools due to their infirmities
he points to a dilapidated gardeners shed
we also require a blacksmiths shop so we can craft braces here on the premises
ive found a wonderful local man who can make crutches and canes
his work is outstanding
of course what is most desperately needed is a hospital
thats going to put my fund raising abilities to the test
franklin wheels himself up a ramp to the inn as eleanor and louis follow
surrounded by peeling wallpaper and threadbare furniture eleanor and louis exchange glances
what exactly are you proposing franklin
that this will be the first polio rehabilitation and treatment center in the world
my personal trust almost covers the price of the inn and the surrounding land
there will be a modest tuition charged to the patients which should hold us over while i seek out investors
franklin youre risking everything you have
and there are other costs to consider
mama will see that the children are provided for
im not speaking of money
i have found something here which makes waking up in the morning remotely bearable and the two of you stand there
franklin i need for you to be practical and realistic
i am trapped inside a body that no longer moves of my own volition
i am trying to be practical
now either youre with me or against me
in or out
i dont care for ultimatums disguised as debate
eleanor starts to leave
where are you going
get back here
i will see you gentlemen tonight
you cant talk to her like that
are you an expert on this now
how should i speak to my wife louis
with the respect she deserves
a beat look i dont deny the work youre doing here could be important could be
the issue is whether you want to run a rehabilitation center or whether you want to run for office again
when i can walk ill run
eleanor approaches the pool
it is as quiet as a church
she is stunned to observe over a dozen tables set up in the water
on each table is a child or an adult polio wearing their bathing suit
next to them is a physical therapist also in bathing attire conducting therapy
in hushed tones the physical therapists encourage and work the distressed limbs of the patients as helena swims to each table overseeing the work being done
eleanor sits down in a chair and watches fascinated
the camera pans various tables revealing legs in braces legs in wheelchairs shapely legs flaccid legs childrens legs
some reveal illicit romances betrayed by secret hand holding and hands on thighs
jake and a new physical therapist mary beth are particularly cozy
this is a very special night were celebrating
at last we are together eating in this dining room
the hands come up and out from under the table applauding
he is in his wheelchair dressed in a jacket and tie
now please join me in welcoming miss jackie mills a new arrival along with her father samuel all the way from oakland california
eight years old with black hair
her legs are in braces and she grips her fathers hand tightly
let us also take this opportunity to welcome our two able bodied guests mr
louis howe and my better half mrs
waving politely from their seats
now for the musical portion of our program
wait a minute
i cant let this opportunity pass without saying out loud what a lot of us feel in our hearts right now
a beat youre a man among men franklin
laughing its a real democracy at warm springs everybody gets heard
to franklin you listening
eleanor seated next to franklin watches as franklin in a rare moment of emotional nakedness is at a loss for words
all right then if i may do the honors of presenting to you the lovely miss eloise hutchison of cottage c
eloise wheels herself out
in a sweet but untrained voice she begins the introduction to her song
singing think of what youre losing by constantly refusing to dance with me
aoud be the idol of france with me
nd yet you stand there and shake your foolish head dramatically hile i sit here so ecstatically
you just look and say emphatically not this season
theres a reason
some members of the audience begin to smile knowing whats coming
various staff step out from the kitchen to watch
eloise is joined by three others all of them in wheelchairs
singing i wont dance
dont ask me
i wont dance
dont ask me i wont dance monsieur with you
simple but clever choreography utilizing the wheelchairs has the audience cheering
my heart wont let my feet do things they should do
you know what
and so what
what you do to me
im like an ocean wave thats bumped on the shore i feel so absolutely stumped on the floor
this is too much for the crowd including franklin eleanor and louis
they laugh and cry in equal measure at the sight of eloise and her chorus
the song finished franklin quiets down the crowd
before we say good night i understand our royal taskmaster in residence miss mahoney insists on having the last word
helena rises from her seat
i dont think words describe adequately what daisy and i would like to show all of you
calling out are you ready daisy
daisys mother cecile carries daisy to the center of the room where helena meets them
helena bends down and removes daisys braces
the room is hushed
daisy then begins to walk tentatively towards her mother
overwhelmed by what is taking place
he looks around and takes in the sight of so many different faces
some are beaming some are fighting back tears some look away
the sight of it almost too painful
a reminder of their own private battles
only a step or two away from her mother she falls the short distance and lands in her mothers outstretched arms
wild cheers go up in the room while daisys face glows with pride
she connects with franklin who matches her smile with his own genuine and beatific
roy lifts franklin out of the wheelchair and on to the bed
eleanor enters holding a lit candle
roy is about to begin franklins bedtime routine but eleanor gently reaches out and touches him on the arm
roy looks to franklin who nods its all right and exits
eleanor closes the door and puts the candle on the bureau
fter a beat franklin begins to unbuckle his pants
he then lies back on the bed
what is your most pressing concern
eleanor kneels before him and tugs the pants down slowly so as not to catch on the braces
eleanor folds the pants and carefully places them over the back of a chair
getting a doctor to live on the premises full time
someone who at the very least could monitor our progress
make us legitimate
she begins to take off franklins braces a series of intricate buckles
eleanor slides the braces off his legs
his legs though now deeply tanned are withered and spindly
he is still wearing his shoes
and that costs more money
eleanor puts the heavy braces against the wall and kneels once again to untie his shoelaces
but the real problem is no one is interested
the annual orthopedics convention is being held in atlanta this weekend and i offered to speak
his anger surfacing they turned me down flat
eleanor takes franklins pajama bottoms off the bed and with tender care pulls them up his legs
a few weeks ago the conditions at a garment factory on west th street were brought to my attention
the owners claimed everything was satisfactory but would never let anyone in to conduct a proper inspection
she reaches for franklins hands and pulls him up to a seated position
they are now face to face
it took awhile but we finally got in
he searches her face for clues as to the woman shes become
he starts to unbutton his shirt and put on his pajama top
eleanor sits in a chair across from him
i showed up with someone from the labor board and we refused to leave until they let us in
what are you suggesting
at the risk of my good standing with the junior assistance league i suggest we crash the party
she stands and walks over to franklin and runs her hand through his hair
e good night franklin
she goes to the door and opens it letting in a shaft of light against the candle lit room
good night babs
she blows the candle out and closes the door
franklins car pulls up to a massive stone building built in greek revival style
franklin looks intimidated there are two dozen stairs leading up to the main entrance
roy climbs the stairs like a stevedore with franklin slung over his shoulder
using enormous force eleanor is pulling the chair up and over each step while walking backwards up the stairs
the stage is lit with a skeleton hanging on a stand and large projections on a screen of spinal discs while a doctor in a dull litany intones a prepared
a clinical situation where the radicular or nerve root is compressed by the prolapsed disc is referred to as a radiculopathy
double doors fly open with a bang as all heads turn to see franklin and eleanor
so sorry were late
eleanor talks quickly while wheeling franklin down the aisle
introducing herself eleanor roosevelt niece of the late president theodore roosevelt and this is my husband franklin former assistant secretary of the navy
sotto to eleanor are you sure this worked on th street
under her breath it seemed to at the time
they reach the befuddled doctor on stage whose name tag reads dr
thank you dr
bissell for agreeing to let us share the stage with you today
it was so generous of you
bissell smiles limply saving face
the audience vaguely applauds
franklin and eleanor are now center stage
my husband as many of you may have read is a victim of polio
however victim is only a definition not a state of mind
he looks at her completely amazed
eleanor gives him an encouraging nod to take over
we all know that poor circulation is a chronic problem for limbs damaged by polio
ive never been able to swim more than a few minutes without becoming too cold
but theres a place gentlemen
a miraculous place not three hours from here where the water is filled with natural minerals at a temperature of almost degrees
that place gentlemen is called warm springs
one doctor in particular s leans forward in his chair listening with great interest
patients can stay in these waters for up to an hour
this is essential in allowing them the time to work on strengthening their muscles
we have come to the shared conclusion that research for the cause and the cure for infantile paralysis is paramount
however until nor contd elea that day arrives more emphasis has be placed on rehabilitation
we personally invite you to warm springs to come and take a look
these men of science are mesmerized by eleanors style both warm and immediate
she has disarmed them with her lack of pretension
on franklin and eleanor their two separate journeys intersecting lightning in a bottle
there is a receiving line in place to get a last word or an autograph with franklin and eleanor
willis bespectacled speaks with them
i saw you speak at the legion hall in cleveland last spring
for the league of women voters
you created quite a stir
not sure youll be asked back
franklin is ready to intervene but eleanor puts her hand on his shoulder stopping him
all smiles well i believe you must say what you feel in your heart what you feel is right for youll be criticized anyway
damned if you do damned if you dont
hebert military in bearing the doctor who listened so intensely steps up in line and shakes hands with eleanor and then franklin
ive been doing my own studies in this area
hebert contd if it is possible id like to come and make an evaluation for the journal of orthopedic medicine
franklin looks to eleanor elated
the sooner the better
roy is fast asleep tucked around the wheelchair in the back seat
franklin smiles in eleanors direction
she looks back at him shyly and smiles in return
but her expression changes when she sees something in his eyes something she hasnt seen for a long time
what is it
a beat who are you
franklin reaches out and takes her hand pulling her close
he stretches his whole arm around her and places her hand on one of the driving knobs his hand on top of hers
i dont know how to drive
ill teach you
they operate the car together their connection complete
franklin and eleanor are sitting in the front seat of the car
louis is already up on the train platform
ill break the news to mama
franklin smiles as they look at each other like two naughty children
i think its going to be fun
eleanor bursts out laughing franklin joins in
words fail me
she leans in and kisses franklin on the mouth
i do so love you
she slides out of the car and goes up to the platform and boards the train while franklin watches her
farmer and his wife from the school house graduation approach franklin
roosevelt you lookin mighty fit
fine day isnt it
hows the boll weevil situation
i expect the boll weevil is always gonna be a situation mr
roosevelt but thanks for askin
franklins energy and vitality are infectious
the politician within him is being reborn
a beaming eleanor sits down next to louis
he too is looking very pleased
eleanor takes notice
why do i get the feeling were not smiling about the same thing
the train begins pulling out
they both look out at franklin
locals are coming up to his car surrounding him he is a magnet
louis is seated in the front row of the balcony of the state assembly his feet up on the railing eating pistachio nuts
also seated are two politicos james hastings and stephen you cant kiss babies from a wheelchair
itll scare their mothers half to death
al smiths got a lock on the presidential nomination
correct me if im wrong but dont you think even after all these years that old als still a little rough around the edges
they laugh knowing this is a huge understatement
franklin can help soften his image
let him put smiths name in nomination
teller and hastings are none to sure
well he is a helluva speech maker
yeah but is your man up to it
its in the bag guys
count on it
bluffing is one of louiss strong suits and it looks like theyre buying it
just then louis notices a familiar face down on the floor
hey stansbury give my best to the misses
to hastings and teller hes lost weight
mustve been the prison food
a line stretches outside with patients waiting to be seen
among them is franklin chatting with everyone else expecting and receiving no priority attention
hebert is examining daisy
helena is by his side filling him in on her case history
helena dressed in a robe walks the halls of the inn
something is amiss
an empty wheelchair illuminated by a sliver of moonlight
on a blanket nearby are jake and mary beth
he unbuttons his shirt and runs her hands over his impressively developed upper body
they begin to kiss hungrily passionately completely in their own world
several yards away across the lawn eloise is in woodhalls arms they are dancing
he is singing softly into her ear as they sway her feet never touching the ground
helena in a nightgown is looking out a window into the distance
fiercely protective and slightly envious of her charges she pulls a pack of cigarettes from her bathrobe pocket and steals a solitary smoke
franklin seated alone on the porch in the darkness
he drags on his cigarette and the red glow illuminates the contours of his face in repose
franklin is on the phone
roy stands by his side
how are you
couldnt be better
i was wondering if youd found a buyer for my naval prints
clearly not i see
well theyre in marvelous condition
all right souders
oh one more thing
i have some beautiful pieces of my grandfathers tang dynasty
an auction in the fall
that sounds promising
ill be in touch
franklin hangs up and sits deep in thought
he rubs his perspiring forehead with the back of his hand
he looks down at his hand and sees that it is shaking
franklin is walking on crutches aided by roy
nearby a group of children practice on parallel bars with helena
what am i going to tell these people if i have to close things down
that you did the best you could
franklin gives roy a look of gratitude then notices lionel approaching with his mail bag
lionel hands franklin a fistful of open envelopes
any good news
creditors are gettin cranky
the operative word was good
oh yah almost forgot
the doctor that came and studied yall sent his report
lionel offers up the envelope but then pulls it back before handing it over
save me the stamps
franklin nods then grabs it from lionel
he rips it open and begins devouring the report
therefore in conclusion my research has shown that the overwhelming majority of patients here have shown some improvement
enough for me to recommend warm water therapy as the standard post polio treatment to the orthopedics society of america
he grips roys arm roy
something catches franklins eye and his smile begins to fade
what is it sir
helena entering the cottage
its not as bad as you think
franklin slams the door behind her and wheels over to the table
he throws back a drink clearly not his first
page twenty nine
angrily read it
of the twenty three patients examined only one a forty four year old male showed little visible signs of improvement
this is one doctors opinion franklin
there is marked falling away of the muscle masses on either side of the spine in the lower lumbar region
his lower extremities present a most depressing picture
she brings the pages down but franklin gestures her to continue
i feel after studying him that the psychological factor in his management is paramount
he has such courage and ambition
yet at the same time he is such an extraordinarily sensitive emotional mechanism
it is difficult for her to continue
that it will take all the skill which we can muster to lead him successfully to a recognition of his severe physical limitations without crushing him
patronizing son of a bitch
i wanted to walk again
and you still might
this report legitimizes weve worked so hard for
we can raise funs now
it could change everything
it wont change anything for me
franklin i wont play this game
i wont feel sorry for you
e reaches for the bottle but helena grabs on to it stopping him
i met a boy today ten years old
hes paralyzed from the waist down
why dont you go regale him with vivid tales about your trips to europe and playing football at school
tell him how you courted your wife and fathered children
tell him of a life he can only dream of
a beat i cant help you out of a hole if i climb in with you
then were both stuck
fred wearing a bow tie and an oversized jacket is proudly polishing off a desktop sign that reads fred botts helena is behind him reading a file
entering heres another one hes refusin
he throws a telegram onto an already large stack
why dont you read it
dont like telegrams
all them stops and stuff
make you dizzy lionel
a little bit
fred eyes the telegram then impulsively grabs it ripping it open
would be honored if you place my name in nomination for president
the party needs you
yours sincerely al smith
the governor of new york
handing it to lionel why dont you slide it under his door
probably slide it right back
fred and helena are silent for a moment
he wont go
he doesnt want to be seen walking on crutches or being wheeled to the podium
the millions listening on radio wont be able to see that
but all the people at the convention will
helena nods thats right
responding to a knock at the door roy gets up from sitting on the couch with franklin sullen and inattentive
e opens the door to louis who walks right in
good afternoon mr
roy takes his hat and coat and exits to the bedroom
i cant believe youve made me come all the way back to this hell hole
ive done no such thing
im here to take you to houston
you started your speech yet
im not going
he stares at franklin drinking
shaking his head he goes over to the sidebar and pours one for himself
you know what this is dont you
its a golden opportunity
a springboard for you to run for governor
ranklin is silent
frustrated louis takes a seat in franklins empty wheelchair
ever hear of a civil war general named francis nicholls
well i never heard of him either
but this was one brave son of a bitch
fought for the confederacy and lost his left arm in one battle and his left foot in another
then after the war he ran and won the governorship of louisiana twice
he was a war hero
with emphasis twice
a beat look ive worked like a dog to keep your name in play grovelling at the feet of the powers that be in back rooms
as much for you as for me
ill be damned if im going to let you pass up a chance like this
its time and youre ready
waiting on the porch are eleanor and helena who are seated talking
louis exits the cottage defeated
eleanor rises and goes into the cottage as louis takes her seat next to helena
roy so good to see you
very good to see you mrs
she approaches a surprised franklin
leaning in she runs a hand across his stubbly beard
he looks up at her
youre a mess
she sits by his side and franklin begins to cry
his sobs grow louder connecting to the despair deep inside him
it unleashes an avalanche of grief
oh my darling
im useless eleanor
i feel so useless
thats not true
no one can make you feel inferior without your consent
finally his sobs subside
you have done a brilliant thing here a magnificent thing
eleanor picks up the e doctors report and puts it in the fire
lets get you in the water
franklin is wheeled down to the pool by roy and eleanor
when they get closer franklin makes out someone already swimming
squinting whos that
elliot roosevelt is now years old
he has his mothers enormous blue eyes and his fathers natural charisma
you getting in
louis and helena approach the pool
i sense a conspiracy
you aint seen nothin yet
ranklin smiles warily
elliot is climbing a rope dangling high from a tree as franklin and eleanor look up at him
franklin is standing on crutches
elliot descends with a flourish as helena approaches franklin with a single cane
franklin let go of your crutches
youre not going to need them
were going to make your arms function as your legs
how is that possible
elliot go to your father and stand on his left side
think this may work pop
eleanor take the crutch
eleanor takes one crutch as helena takes the other replacing it in franklins hand with a cane
then with elliot on franklins left side she bends elliots arm at a right angle like a parallel bar and hooks franklins left arm around his
going over to franklins right side she puts a cane in his hand
to franklin now use your right shoulder and pull your left leg forward
he does so
now with the muscles in your left shoulder pull your right leg
one small bump and ill land right on my keister
thats what elliot is for
hes going to hold you up
hitch your leg
franklin and elliot attempt to walk
it requires immense strength and effort on both their parts
ever the taskmaster elliot dont lean in stand up straight
pull against him
he needs you
after one or two steps the enormity of it overwhelms franklin
im strong pop
you cant hurt me
you can do this franklin
they start the walk again
but its working
under his breath ill be damned
franklin stops exhausted
franklin are you all right
roy runs in with a chair and helps franklin into it as helena eleanor louis elliot and roy all look at him concerned
this isnt a replacement for the real work were doing to get you on your feet again understand
no one is throwing in the towel or even agreeing with that doctors report
i know i know
i know its not practical
no its not
a beat its political
franklin looks at louis then to eleanor and realizes that this could be it
franklin and elliot are walking
helena is close behind coaching
use elliot not the cane
switch your weight to elliot
keep your head up
off to the side pat jake eloise woodhall and daisy are having an informal picnic observing franklin
why is he working so hard to hide it
he doesnt have a choice
oh i disagree
how can you disagree
there but for the grace of god goes us thats what theyre saying
as if our bodies is who we are but its not
its our souls is who we are but they dont know that
i wish he could just wheel himself out there in front of everybody
he cant do that eloise its politics
its not gonna matter if he hides his legs as long as he dont hide what he knows
and what he knows is what its like to be one of us
ranklin getting closer raises his cane in greeting
good afternoon everyone
off balance franklin goes down hard bringing elliot down with him
eleanor louis and roy all rush to his aid but helena is there first
take a moment to catch your breath
you okay son
im fine pop
you fell down
yes i did daisy
twelfth time today
must be a new record
daisy laughs as do the others though some cant hide their concern
franklin struggles hard as roy and elliot help him to his feet
eleanor is packing franklins suitcase while franklin sitting up in bed dressed in pajamas works on his speech
reading aloud and so america must find
reconsidering no america needs a pathfinder
louis pacing in shirtsleeves nods approvingly
to emblaze the trail along a high road that will avoid
avoid the bottomless morass
discouraged franklin pushes aside the pages
what is it
what if i fall
trying to get to the podium
if you fall you show them how to get up
no if i fall in front of thousands of people i lose everything but their pity
a beat theyll be writing my obituary before i get up off the floor
elliot wont let you fall hell be there
all the arrangements have been made boss
itll be fine
who are we fooling
this will never work
theyll never let me back into politics
theyll never see past my legs
my darling theyll never see past your legs unless you do
franklin is settling into the drivers seat of his car aided by roy
eleanor is seated next to him louis and elliot in back
franklins attention is diverted by something he sees straight ahead
it is the entire warm springs group coming down the driveway in chairs and on crutches
all the patients the push boys the physical therapists helena jake fred aunt sally eloise and lionel
dont worry doc were not coming with you
oh youll be with me
no question of that
a beat i am proud more than you will ever know to be part of this community
his voice growing stronger a community based not on birthright or privilege but on compassion and courage
the true power of these waters is that they brought us all together
our ability to help one another is what will make our victory over polio endure
our ability to survive
despite the odds
ranklin looks out at the sea of faces
what we have done and will continue to do until this disease is defeated is come together like a family and do what we do best
his voice breaking lift each other up
franklin starts the car as the crowd begins to disperse
then spying helena franklin calls out to her
miss mahoney i need to speak with you please
off her smile franklin reaches into his pocket and withdraws a small box
he hands it to helena
she just stares at it at a loss for words
she does so tentatively revealing a ladies watch
dont wear it in the pool
ill try not to
good luck franklin
im throwing myself to the wolves
youve faced worse
and if they bite you can come back here
ill always come back here
helena steps away and franklin pulls out and down the driveway
dark and deserted roy is carrying franklin down a flight of stairs
louis is hastily checking over his shoulder
if possible eleanor appears even more nervous than louis
youre being superstitious louis
there arent any reporters here
suddenly out of the darkness a flashbulb pops revealing a dozen or more reporters staring incomprehensibly at the sight of a six foot lb
man being carried like a baby in the arms of a black man
no one does or says a thing
the photographer who had the wherewithal to snap the one picture raises his camera to take another
but dan reed a reporter for the new york herald tribune and a gentle giant at over six foot four reaches out and places a massive hand over the lens
slowly but firmly he pulls the camera down
louis and eleanor stand stock still tense watching the scene unfold roy is sweating his arms growing weak
elliot brings the chair around and roy gently lowers franklin into it
its a measure of reeds standing with this group that his authority is unquestioned
but the photographer raises his camera again
only now reed isnt as kind
he grabs the camera from him and opens the back pulling out the film and exposing it
tipping his hat good to see you mr
the enormous arena is empty but for some maintenance workers and janitors
louis enters and makes his way to the stage
he approaches dead center and stands behind the podium looking out
gripping the podium hard he rocks it back and forth
taking no chances he pulls a hammer out from the rear of his waistband and a bunch of nails from his coat pocket
looking around to see if anyone is paying any attention to him he quickly ducks down behind the podium
the sound of hammering fills the hall as louis on his knees nails the podium to the floor
twenty thousand conventioneers are roasting in the hall
it is houston in the summer and its broiling hot
a sea of hand held red white and blue fans are being waved all at once most bearing the words smith for president
near the stage is a long table where the new breed of radio reporters are seated each in front of a primitive looking microphone
hovering in a group off to the side are dan reed and the reporters from the previous night
franklin is standing ramrod straight holding onto elliots arm
he looks handsome in a navy pin striped suit
as everyone else is sweating no one notices that franklin is perspiring more than f most
where is she seated
louis a human train wreck himself reaches over to mop franklins brow with a handkerchief
in a box stage left
give me your hand
franklin takes his hand off his cane
its soaking wet
louis wipes it gently
louis what the hell am i doing
putting your big toe in the water
just then a voice booms out from the loudspeakers ladies and gentlemen i would like to introduce to you a man who as assistant secretary of the navy served our
country with distinction
member of an illustrious family of long standing political commitment to our great nation
ladies and gentlemen franklin delano roosevelt
franklin turns to elliot and they both take deep breaths
to elliot lets go
the curtains part and they begin moving forward
a blinding spotlight picks up franklin and elliot
the spotlight follows them as they make their way to the podium
franklin is hitching each leg forward slowly
the tip of his cane hits the floor with pinpoint accuracy for balance and support
he leans heavily on elliots arm
the walk appears effortless
he chats with elliot the whole way still managing to flash the conventioneers his million dollar smile
but the walk is slow and the ovation is beginning to fade
ouis stands in the wings clutching the curtain with one hand and covering his eyes with the other
eleanor sits looking down at her lap afraid to even breathe
franklin and elliot are still ten steps away from the podium
sensing the crowd noise weakening he whispers to elliot
laugh as if im making a joke
elliot throws back his head and laughs
the crowd wanting to be in on it rise as one in a sustained cheer
but a puddle of sweat caused by the dripping perspiration from franklins hands is causing the tip of his cane to slip
elliot ever aware grips him tighter averting disaster and finally they reach the podium
franklin grabs one side of the podium while elliot with a sleight of hand houdini would admire locks his fathers braces whisks the cane away pulls his fathers speech from
his breast pocket and lays it smoothly on the podium
the view from behind displays how franklins legs are spread wide for stability as he clutches the podium
he holds on tightly as if the wood might snap from his grip
from out front the crowd sees only a powerful man standing tall amidst the flashbulbs popping
franklin has made it
he is home
all the denizens of warm springs are crowded around the radio
here on the stage is franklin roosevelt
a figure tall and proud even in suffering a face of classic profile a frame nervous and yet self controlled
a man softened cleansed and illumined with pain
governor al smith is seated by a radio surrounded by cronies
an overblown irishman with gold capped teeth and heavy new york accent
he chomps on a lit cigar that never leaves the side of his mouth
hell of an ovation al
couldnt have asked for anything more
smith sits silently puffing on his cigar
you may have to be careful though
looks like youre raising up a rival
after a beat mark my words
hell be dead in a year
eleanor applauds franklin as a reporter leans in
roosevelt one last question
do you think polio has affected your husbands mind
smiling yes i do
i certainly do
franklin stands before the crowd
his magnetism is incontestable
he radiates infinite possibility
he looks up to eleanors box and they smile at one another as the crowd continues to applaud
the mineral springs gently ripple as franklin appears in the water
as the following words appear on the screen franklin slowly and confidently swims out of frame
four years later franklin delano roosevelt was elected president of the united states
he was elected three more times unprecedented in u
during his years as president he saw the country through the great depression and a world war waged on six continents
on april in the thirteenth year of his presidency at the age of sixty three franklin roosevelt died in his cottage at warm springs
the beneficiary of his life insurance policy was warm springs
which continues to flourish as a rehabilitation center to this day
