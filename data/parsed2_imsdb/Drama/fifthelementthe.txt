the fifth element an original script by luc besson revisions by luc besson and robert mark kamen august draft gaumont and les films du dauphin somewhere in the nile at
the edge of the desert
omar and his mule zigzag along the bottom of sun scorched dunes
the mule and the boy finally reach a camp
a few tents dwarfed by a huge temple door jutting out of the sand
the camp is deserted except for some kids by the temple entrance holding large mirrors reflecting light into the temple
omar leaves his mule in the shade seizes two goatskins and slips inside the temple
omar makes his way uneasily down a pillared corridor that opens into a vast room where an old scientist stands on a small wooden ladder in front of the wall
across the room
professor massimo pacoli
a young man is beside him billy masterson age an american student
he has a large sketchpad in his hands
behind them aziz age whose job is to hold the last mirror which shines light into the expansive room
when the three planets are in eclipse
his fingers trace across the wall which is covered with symbols and strange hieroglyphs as he deciphers
the black hole like a door is open
sowing terror and chaos
the snake billy
the ultimate evil make sure you get the snake
the professor points emphatically to the snake the symbol of evil coming through the door between the three planets in eclipse
billys hand sketches the snake quickly
he is a natural artist
and when is this door opening snake act supposed to occur
the professors fingers touch the signs
if this is the five
and this the thousand
every five thousand years
kidding so i have some time
he reaches for the pad
angle on omar
standing at the entrance to the chamber with the water bag entranced by the sight
a skeletal hand falls on his shoulder
omar turns to an ancient priest in a rough milled black cannock
i will take it to them my son
startled but obedient omar gives the water bag to the priest
go with god
be safe from evil
the priest makes the sign of the cross on the boys forehead dismissing him
as soon as he is gone the priest turns a worried eye to the professor
angle on the professor is back to translating billy to sketching
then arrange the elements of life against the terror just so
his fingers run on
four elements around the fifth
his fingers fall on the one element that has a human shape surrounded by all the others
the priest opens the water skin and begins to pour a vial of powder into the skin
angle on aziz falling asleep
the mirror falls the light fails
the boy struggles to stay awake
the mirror comes up
lord forgive me
they already know too much
in which all the history of the universe resides all the strength
all the hope
protect us from evil
the professor turns to the priest who is pouring water into a tin cup from the skin
it in the most extraordinary thing
the greatest find in history
can you imagine the implications
only too well
here you must be parched
he hands the cup to the professor
the professor takes it has it almost to his lips when
i mean look
it is like a battle plan
in his excitement he does not drink much to the priests chagrin
here the good
here the evil
as the priest looks up aziz the mirror boy tips his mouth under the water skin drinking the leakage
he points to the five elements
a weapon against evil
i am going to be famous
then let us toast to your fame
the priest hands billy a cup
the professor raises the cup to drink and then
we cannot toast with water
in my sack
the priest watches disconsolate as the professor tosses away his water
billy finishes his cup before running off into the tunnel
a muffled sound grows steadily louder
outside a monstrous linear shadow disturbs the kids game and gradually darkens the temple entrance
billy is looking for the grappa in the professors bag
he comes upon a machine pistol
when the muffled sound suddenly grabs his attention
he leans toward the corridor and sees part of a spaceship appear
billy is paralyzed
the professor keeps reading over the inscription
this perfect person
this perfect being
i do not understand this
where is that boy
billy presses himself against the wall in the shadows terrified but sketching away like mad as large shadowed figures lumber past him
he begins to blink feeling the effects of the priests potion
the professor reads the wall
and this divine light they talk about
what is divine light
at that moment the reflection from azizs mirror drops again
the light fails
without turning aziz light
the room is flooded with light all of the sudden
this is the most unbelievable thing i have ever seen
the professor turns around and is stunned speechless to find himself face to face with two mondoshawans
a dozen others fill the hall manning the source of the light large luminous globes
aziz is fast asleep
uncomprehending uh yes
the professor is lifted up and carried off to the side by the aliens
the kommander stops in front of the priest who is still on his knees face to the ground
he was about to discover everything but i had the situation under control
the two mondoshawan guards hold the professor three feet off the ground
in a panic who are you
are you germans
sprechen sie deutsch
billy staggers forward a machine pistol in his hand
the kommander holds out his hand to the priest
what did i do wrong
the priest jumps to his feet excitedly
servant you and the thousand guards before you
you have done your work well but we have to recover the elements
war will soon engulf your planet
we must keep them safe
the kommander goes over to the wall and seems to be looking for a lock
he finds it and slides in his metallic finger which is more intricate than a key to a safe
he turns his hand activating a mechanism that opens the wall
the kommander turns around and crooks a finger
one of the mondoshawans waves his hand puts the professor to sleep and heads down the hallway revealed by the opening
he is followed by his men
the priest slips in behind them
the kommander steps into a vast room
the ceiling is very high pyramid shaped
in each corner of the room four vessels contain four rectangular twelve inch stones the four elements
in the middle an opaque sarcophagus rests on an altar
the kommander stops and contemplates it a moment
to himself the fifth element
take them and put them in a safe place
his men carry out his order
billy staggers across the floor struggling to stay awake
the kommander opens a case
his men come and put the four precious stones in it one by one
moved will the elements be gone now forever from this place
when mankind comes to its senses
we will return
knowing mankind as i do that could take centuries
time is of no importance only life is important
the priest nods and lowers his eyes
angle on billy staggering forward raising his pistol blinking his eyes to focus
a mondoshawan puts the fourth element in the case the kommander shuts the case and looks at the priest
when evil returns so shall we
head lowered we will be ready lord
billy suddenly staggers into the room brandishing his gun
billy trips the gun goes off
he empties the clip
the mondoshawan carrying the case crumples to the ground
the wall immediately begins to close
billy fires wildly unable to control the powerful kicking gun
the priest rushes billy
the weapon has such a kick to it that billy starts shooting into the air backs up then stumbles and knocks himself out
the priest is on the ground seriously wounded
so is the kommander
the warriors are in a panic
the walls closing
the wall continues to close
sand pours in from everywhere
the vast room fills up like an hourglass
a mission is a mission savoia
youll learn that
the kommander picks up the case and reaches the wall but cant get through it
his armor is too bulky the opening too small
he manages to get his arm and the case through
my apologies to general kroi and my wife
the wall closes crushing his arm
the clerk scoops up the case and runs through the huge piles of sand
the clerk boards the ship carrying the case
omar hides in a corner frightened to death hugging billys bag of drawings
the room fills with sand
the priests body is soon buried
the huge ships main hatch closes
the ship lifts off and speeds away
omar emerges from the temple gaping at the ship as it vanishes in the sky
a gigantic shooting star flashes above the pyramids
the ship passes in front of us and heads for the stars disappearing at unbelievable speed
the background is a star spattered cosmos
another more modern spaceship fills the screen
a warship belonging to the federal army
cu of a digital control screen
three planets projecting three straight lines that crisscross at one point
identical to the one observed by the professor on the temple wall
general staedert looks out through the ships window at one of the three huge planets in eclipse
dont you have anything
not even a temperature
the thermo analyzers have jammed
one of them reads over a million degrees the others at minus
never seen anything like it
its taking shape
in the middle of the shadows a door to the nightmare has just opened
evil is back
a round moving mass continually changing color
in awe what the hell can it be
hook up with the president in one minute general
general staedert remains calm
send out a probe
lindberg the president of the united federations his features lined and worn by various delegations mainly military enters his office
theres a crisis in the air
the presidents aide leans down to his ear
on air in seconds
in the middle of the group is a priest whose appearance reminds us of egypt
a younger man david shy a priest in training attends the old man
president on line sir
general staedert leans over his screen and seems surprised to see the room but not the president
staedert do you read me
i can hear you mr
president but i cant see you
the president grabs the mini camera on his desk and yanks it around to face him
his face fills the screen
exasperated is that better
i have to address the supreme council in minutes
just the facts general
there are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet all the calibers are overshot
were hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging
exasperated what you are saying is you dont know what this
consternation reigns in the presidents office
not yet sir
the only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger
wait or act
my philosophy mr
president is shoot first ask questions later
i dont like uninvited guests
i think it would be foolish to shoot at an organism that seems alive without first taking the time to study it more
besides it has shown no signs of hostility
its just getting bigger
so do people but thats no reason to shoot them
exasperated the security of the federated territories is and remains number one priority
to the military i suppose general staederts philosophy is acceptable to you
all the generals nod yes all right then
the president scans the room
staedert remote controls the camera toward the room
the camera moves up the priest and we finally discover his face
he is in his sixties a shrewd look in his eyes
around his neck hangs the kommanders finger the key to the temple
cornelius vito cornelius
th level parish
i have a different theory to offer you mr
imagine for a moment that this
thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be because it is the antithesis of all we are
because it is evil
a little sarcastically one more reason to shoot first eh
all the generals nod in agreement
evil begets evil mr
shooting would only make it stronger
the probe will attain its objective in five seconds
staedert moves closer to the ships window
evil swallows the probe and immediately bubbles over with activity like a furious volcano
president were at crisis point
the president looks puzzled
your theory is interesting father but i dont think we have time to go into it right now
time is of no importance mr
only life is important
exasperated thats exactly what we are going to try and do protect the lives of some billion of our fellow citizens
you may fire when ready
cold to the captain up front loading of a zzr missile
marker lights on the objective
all of a sudden outside the ship the strange planets activity ceases
a black crust immediately covers it
consulting new data its structure has just solidified on the surface as if the object felt something
if thats the case we are undoubtedly dealing with an intelligence
the most terrible intelligence imaginable mr
the president hesitates
the ship is in combat formation
the missile is loaded general
give me a minute
i have a doubt
cold i dont mr
the missile explodes from the ship and penetrates its target
the explosion is swallowed like a fizzy pill in a small glass of water
and then the mass grows larger
staedert looks worried
load a series of missiles
maximum shield protection
the president is growing ever more worried
whats going on
did you destroy it
im about to mr
a series of three missiles heads for the planet which absorbs them all
and literally doubles in size
the planets diameter has greatly increased and its moving toward the ship
get out of there immediately
i dont want an incident do you hear me staedert
worried what do we have thats bigger than
staedert get out of there
thats an order
a bead of sweat pearls staederts forehead
he is about to give an order when a gigantic flame emerges from the planet and literally swallows staederts spaceship
eyes wide good god
the flame fills the screen with a horrendous noise that
wakes up a man trying to escape from a nightmare
korben dallas rubs his head
thirty five years old short hair powerfully built unquestionable charm good looking in spite of the scars here and there
the alarm clock is still ringing it shows the date as march
it in two in the morning
ha grabs a cigarette and stops to look for a light
he shuts oft the alarm
he hears a cat mewing in the hall
but it still rings
korben takes a moment and then realizes it in the phone that is ringing
to the cat im coming
he grabs the phone and crosses his tiny apartment feet long by feet wide heading for the door patting himself for a light
behind him the bed makes itself automatically
on the phone yeah
he opens the door for the cat and starts to rummage through a drawer for a match
out come a handful of war decorations a heros collection
to the cat hi sweetie
a medal of honor certificate to major dallas i love you too major but you havent called me that since basic training
i was talking to the cat
oh yeah i forgot
you still prefer your cat to the real thing
a picture of korben and his ex wife on their wedding day
at least the cat comes back
ironical you still pining for that two timing bitch
there are a million women out there
i dont want a million i just want one
a perfect one
dont exist bud
a picture of korben and finger in uniform next to a space fighter
i just found a picture of you
how do i look
korben finds a box of matches with three matches
he strikes one
it does not light
korben opens the fridge bare except for an empty can of gemini croquettes
on the packet is an ad must be an old picture
listen you gotta bring me your hack for the month overhaul
korben heats up some brackish water
sighs i dont need one
you forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions
i know how you drive
im driving a cab now not a space fighter
how many points you got left on your license
at least fifty
in your dreams
see you tonight
finger has hang up
korben sighs and does the same
he gets the heated brackish water and sits down
the cat pounces on the table and meows for its food
korben pours half the coffee in the cats cup
the cat meows
korben taps his cup to the cats saucer
the office is emptied only a few army officers remain
an ancient manuscript billys drawings sits in front of the president
cornelius turns page after page illustrating his point
to the president we have forty eight hours the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions
worried and then
and then it will be too late
the goal of evil is to wipe out life
all forms of life
for all eternity
life upsets it
the president appears upset himself by this image
is there anything that can stop it
the mondoshawan spaceship bursts through a star cluster and fills the screen
the manuscript is open on the presidents desk
close on billys rendering of the mondoshawan
to the president the mondoshawans dont belong to the federated territories but they are peaceful
in their possession are the four elements of life
these elements when they are gathered around a fifth the supreme being ultimate warrior created to protect life
the supreme being is standing as if frozen in armor
all we see is the bottom half of his body
big metallic gloves hold the case engraved with the emblem of the three suns containing the four sacred stones
will produce what the ancients called the light of creation the light of total goodness which is the only thing that can defeat evil
the president points to the spot occupied by the th element
but what happens if instead of this
it is evil who stands here
white turns to black
light to dark
life to death
for all eternity
the presidents nerves quiver
sir we have a mondoshawan spaceship at the frontier requesting permission to enter our territory
i guess i should make a decision
they are the only ones who can help
the mondoshawan do not belong to the federation
we do not know their intention
i must recommend a full trinuclear assault
yells did you see that
swallow our battleship like a gum drop
you cant even tell me what it is
i ask you for options you give me bullshit
give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards
relieved thank you mr
the mondoshawan spaceship zips across the federated galaxy
but it is not alone two black warships seem to be dogging it
the mondoshawans have spotted the spacecraft chasing them
two non identified ships approaching
must be the welcoming committee
a mangalore sits at the controls of the warship
his terrifying features tell us what sort of welcome they can expect
the pilot fires without warning
the huge ship is badly hit and immediately swerves oft course
panic aboard the mondoshawan ship
weve been hit
blast after blast hits the defenseless ship
were losing control
we have to land fast
the huge ship veers oft course and heads for a small red planet taking hit after hit
send out a distress signal
activate the emergency landing procedure
the huge ship approaches the planet at blinding speed
impact in less than ten seconds
the red planet looms ever closer
time is of no importance
the ship crashes in a gigantic explosion
a thermo nuclear explosion fills a t
which korbens cat watches with interest
korben is about to exit the apartment
dont watch it all day itll rot your mind
in response the cat meows
korben opens the door to
a huge gun brandished by a nervous mugger pointing right in his face
the cash man
been here long
dont fuck with me man or ill blow you into tomorrow
unperterbed korben looks at the muggers fearsome weapon
isnt that a z
neuro charged assault model
off balance uh
you know you could hurt someone with this puppy
good thing its not loaded
the mugger is lost
he looks at his weapon
you gotta push the little yellow button
korben points to the button on the side of the gun
the mugger takes his advice
and with lightning speed korben blasts the mugger with a straight right hand sending him down for the count
korben retrieves the gun
you know these things are very illegal
you could get in a shit load of trouble
i better hang onto it for you
as the mugger clears his head korben opens a drawer next to him which is full of similar guns
the muggers eyes pop out of his head
he scampers to his feet and runs off
korben shrugs exits his apartment and closes the door
the cat watches a nuclear holocaust on t
korben enters his taxi
a robotic voice greets him
please enter your license
korben complies and starts to push a series of buttons on the dash
welcome on board mr
how you doing this morning
korben hits a button
the garage door starts to open
i had the worst goddamn nightmare
you have nine points left on your license
thanks for reminding me
as the garage door lifts the megalopolis that is new york city in the rd century comes into view
startling in its height and breath
have a nice day
korben lets the propulsion build
he lets the gear slip
the taxi rockets off into the city
cornelius collapses in a chair
we are lost
president the attack was launched by two unregistered warships
close all borders and declare a state of general alert
to another officer try to contact these mondoshawans
we owe them an explanation
lost to himself what are we going to do
this is government business now
you ought to go home and get some rest father
the president motions to his guards to come and get cornelius
i promise to keep you informed
a weary cornelius leaves the room with davids help
to the captain has the rescue team found any survivors
an arm on a surgical cart moves down the hall of the nucleological center the most sterile of environments
professor mactilburgh age hurries alongside general munro
this is all that survived
actually only one cell survived
have you identified it
its not that easy
weve never encountered anything like it before
you see normal human beings have dna memo groums
which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself
this one has
talk english doc
this cell is like a huge library
it has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside
almost like it was
sounds like a freak of nature to me
i cant wait to meet him
they pass into the lab
the two enter a cylindrical laboratory
there is a huge glass turbine in the middle with the metal glove inside
a dna chain scrolls on the computer screen
rather fascinated the compositional elements of his dna chain are the same as ours there are simply more of them tightly packed
his knowledge is probably limitless
worried is there any danger
some kind of virus
we put it through the cellular hygiene detector
the cell is for lack of a better word
munro hesitates a moment
then he sighs and uses his personal key to open the self destruct box
ok go ahead
perfect better be polite
otherwise i turn him into cat food
mactilburgh starts the operation rolling as munro puts his hand on the sell destruct button ready to use it
thousands of cells form in the heart of the generator an assemblage of dna elements
then the cells move down a tube like a fluid and gather in an imprint of a human body
step by step bones are reconstructed then the nervous and muscular systems
whole veins wrap around the muscles
an entire body is reconstructing before our very eyes
three seconds to ultra violet protection
a shield comes over the reconstructing body and makes it invisible
to munro this is the crucial phase the reconstruction of pigment
cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react to protect themselves
that means growing skin
the meter slows drops to zero
end of reconstruction beginning of reanimation
a whoosh of air in the glass chamber
captain munro has his hand on the self destruct button ready to destroy the being that has barely been reborn
pushing a button activate life support system
an electrical discharge fills the glass chamber causing the body inside to jerk
after a few moments of silence the sound of a heartbeat fills the room over the loudspeaker
life support system activated
the supreme being is alive once again
remove the shield
the assistant automatically removes the ultra violet shield which slowly reveals
and very beautiful
munro stands there gaping
not quite his vision of the supreme being
mactilburgh glances at munro and gently pushes his hand away from the self destruct button
with a smile i told you
munro is hypnotized by the girls beauty
id uh like to get a few pictures for the archives before she wakes up
mactilburgh looks at him with a grin
a remote control camera approaches the girls face a flash goes off
blinded by the flash the girl jumps and screams
she cowers in a corner shaking from the cold darting eyes everywhere looking for the case she was holding
very angry ouacra cocha o dayodomo binay ouacra mo cocha ferji akba ligounai makta keratapla
seno santonoi aypa
minoi ay cheba
worried whats she saying
to his assistant activate the phonic detector
the girl kicks the window repeatedly
and give her a light sedative
and something to wear
the assistant hits a button
a pile of clothes drops out of a trapdoor in the ceiling
she snatches up the clothes angrily and dresses quickly
munro draws closer to the glass window
he watches her dress with undisguised pleasure
to mactilburgh this thing solid
smiling an elephant couldnt crack it
the girl finishes dressing
angrily teno akta chataman assin omekta
munro smiles safely behind his plate glass window
with a smile youre gonna have to learn to communicate better than that angel if you want out
munro dangles the key on a chain that will let her out
the girl rams her fist right through the window
she grabs the key and yanks it
the chain snaps tight and munro slams into the window knocking himself out
the girl puts her hand through the window again unlocks the chamber and steps out
she is still bit wobbly on her legs
two guards try to grab her
she sends them flying across the room
mactilburgh is most impressed
he sets off a general alarm
the girl runs through a maze of corridors looking for a way out
a squad of security guards appear in front of her and open fire without warning
the girl takes a leap grabs an air vent kicks it out and dives into the air shaft
the cops try and jump up to the vent but none can reach it
get me a chair or a stepladder the rest of you go through the main ventilation
the girl moves along unable to see whats ahead of her
she comes to a dead end a grill that leads outside
she pushes it out and exits onto the ledge
she has exited to a ledge on the th floor of a building right in the middle of manhattan which we discover for the first time
the city has become monstrous
buildings rise stories
subways run vertically
the girl edges along the narrow ledge unfazed by the height
the chief leans out the vent looking out into the void
to his men go on follow her
the cops stare into the gaping void
the chief angrily pulls out his gun and shoots at the girl who ducks around the corner of the building
unfortunately the other side in full of cops as well
a flying police car zooms up in front of her sirens blaring
this in the police
your status is illegal
please put up your hands and follow our instructions
the girl feels trapped
she looks down into the endless below and all the cars flying underneath her
then she raises her arms
and dives off
in the car
she dove off
in a panic the cop makes a wrong turn
the girl falls for several seconds
she lands on the roof of a flying cab
korben tries to control his car reeling from the impact
you have just had an accident
seven points have been temporarily removed
korben manages to stop his cab pulls over to the side
you have one point left on your license
have a good day
korben sighs and looks in the back seat to see what the damages are
the girl a bit dazed who wouldnt be emerges from the debris and sits up
theres some blood on her face
korben is stunned
the girls still alive and
his heart heads for a meltdown
akina delutan nou shan
lost scuse me
a police car with wailing sirens halts in front of korben
over a loudspeaker you have an unauthorized passenger in your vehicle
we are going to arrest her
please leave your hands on the wheel
thank you for your cooperation
obeying sorry hon but i only got one point left on my license and i gotta get to the garage
the police car presses up against the cab
doors slide open
huge guns point at her
korben feels lousy
the girls helpless there are tears in her eyes she looks exhausted
korben glances at her in the rear view mirror
shes looking all around to find something to help her communicate with him
her pov an ad on the back of the seat
an number to help an orphanage
a teary photo of a kid over the words please help
she shoots to korben a look of pure distress
korben cant resist her plea
dont put me in this position
im late as it is
but he cannot say no to her eyes
fingers gonna kill me
korben shuts oft the meter and floors it sideswiping the police car as he roars away
your license has been revoked
would you please
korben whips out a gun and shatters the loudspeaker
i hate when people cry
i got no defense
the police car takes out after him sirens screeching
an insane chase ensues
korben and his flying taxi are absolute masters of the air
the cops have trouble following him but then another cop car comes to join in the fun
korben drives like a man possessed nothing can stop him
except the dead end hes just come up against
daya deo dono dato
it theres one thing i dont need advice on its how to drive
korben turns his cab sideways and scrapes through a narrow passageway ripping his taxi light from the roof
the police car smashes into the wall
the other one brakes just in time
attention all patrol cars
the car makes a u turn looking for a wider passageway
the police car roars up sirens screaming then slows down and checks out a dead end flanked by a large vertical neon billboard
the dead end is empty
korbens cab is hidden vertically behind the billboard
seeing nothing the police drive away
well wait till things quiet down a bit
the girl grabs his shirt collar and pulls him close whispers in his ear
youre not that bad
come on well get you to a doctor
the girl hands him the handle of the case struck with the three egyptian suns
the girl nods then faints
korben is somewhat lost faced with so much mystery
the door opens
korben is there with the unconscious girl in his arms
embarrassed excuse me im looking for a priest
tired weddings are one floor down
cornelius closes the door
the doorbell rings again
shes not my bride shes my fare
shes looking for this vito cornelius
according to the phone guide he lives here
curious thats me
but i dont know who she is
where did you find her
she dropped in on me
korben hands him the metal handle with the three egyptian suns stamped on it
staggered the fifth element
he faints dead away
korben with the girl still in his arms looks around helpless
sighing fingers gonna kill me
in his armchair cornelius gets woken by a slap in the face
with a start who are you
i brought the girl remember
cornalius gets up
he looks at the handle
she dropped in on me
i mean on my taxi
this bizarre language
and then it dawns on cornelius who the girl is
eyes riveted on her hes a she
bemused you noticed
face shining theres not a moment to lose
wake her up but be gentle about it
this woman is mankinds most precious possession
so you do know her
uh yes were cousins
cornelius runs into the next room
korben looks at the girl goes to slap her then changes his mind
her beauty troubles him
he hesitates then gently caresses her cheek
her skin seems so soft so fragile
david is mending a cassock when cornelius bursts into the room out of breath
its a miracle
worried what is
babbling crazily i cant wear these clothes
this calls for dignity
i have to dress the part
he opens a closet filled with identical robes and plunges in disappearing as david looks on uncomprehending
korben gently kisses the girls cheeks but she doesnt respond
he looks around then kisses her on the lips
the girls eyes snap open
when korben straightens up he discovers his own gun jammed under his chin
angry eto akta gamat
embarrassed im sorry its just that
i was told to wake you up gently so i figured
the girl pauses a moment
she stares at him looks puzzled
youre right i was wrong
i shouldnt have kissed you
especially since we havent been introduced and
he pulls out a business card here its a bit late but
my name is korben korben dallas
keep it you never know maybe
youll need a cab one day
ill be happy to open the door this time
the girl hesitates then snatches the card like a wild animal
cornelius is lost in the closet
father will you please explain whats going on
the supreme being the fifth element is here in our parish
its a miracle
whats your name
after a moment leeloo minai lekarariba laminai tchai ekbat de sebat
polite hey thats

korben is falling in love
cornelius bursts into the room
she turns the gun on him
he bows before her
appipulai leeloo minai
corn i lius
bowing at your service
leeloo lowers her guard starts to laugh
an irresistible childish laugh
you sure shes the supreme being
absolutely sure theres the triple suns on her gloves
david bows low but his eyes glance up at leeloo
cornelius begins to lead korben toward the door hustling him out
they all like this in your family father
shes an exception
thank you so much for your help mr
cornelius takes his arm
leeloo stops laughing when she sees korben leaving
thank you very much
a thousand times over
i might call to check up on her you know
to see if shes better
shes fine really

shes had a very long trip
i was there when she arrived
cornelius is about to close the door
korbens hand blocks it
just one thing
she said something to me a while ago and
i dont really get it
it means never without my permission
thats what i thought
cornelius slams the door in his face
korben beads down the hallway
he passes his neighbor
korben enters his apartment
the door slides back and the cat comes rubbing up against him tail in the air
i forgot your food
im really sorry
how about a nice thai nosh to apologize
how does that sound huh
the cat meows appeased just an the phone rings
im waiting all day here
i was on the way over but i had a fare fall into my lap
yknow one of those big fares you just cant resist
suspicious so just how big was this fare
korben takes out a cigarette
and i dont suppose you got the name of this
leeloo has a towel wrapped around her it looks like she just took a shower
she sits in front of a computer wolfing down some chicken
data scrolls by on the screen
david watches from the corner in awe
whats she doing
learning our history
the last years that she missed
shes been out of circulation a while you know
leeloo breaks into her childish laughter
whatre you laughing about
pronouncing badly napoleon
she laughs again and tosses some capsules into the microwave
hesitant uh father i know shes been through a lot
but the sacred stones
we dont have much time
leeloo takes her plate out of the microwave
a steaming plate heaped with chicken and exotic vegetables
im sorry to interrupt you but
she sits back down in front of the screen and chomps away heavily on her second chicken
cornelius sits opposite her
and holds up the case handle
serious the case
with the stones
where is it
san agamat chay bet
the case was stolen
leeloo nods her head quite unperturbed and continues to devour the food in front of her
shocked who in gods name would do such a thing
close on a pair of feet limping heavily
a man comes alongside them
excuse me sir the council is worried about the economy heating up
they wondered if it would be possible to fire
they reach a door at the end of the corridor
zorg enters a code
is all they need sir
zorg turns slowly
a small scar across run across his face his eye stutters
this is not a man to cross or contradict
sorry to have disturbed you
the door opens
and david enters carrying a bundle of clothes
there was this guy with a limp who came a month ago
said he was an art dealer
asking all these questions about the sacred stones
at the time i didnt think anything of it
what was his name
im so bad with names
to leeloo timid i didnt know your size
leeloo is happy
she pulls off the towel and stands there nude
cornelius and david turn away
they really made her
leeloo finishes dressing
she is delighted
to david domo danko
david smiles dumb with admiration
cornelius comes over
we must get them back
leeloo settles down sits at the computer and turns it on
me imanetaba oum dalat
you know exactly where they are
a group of handsome warriors approaches
aknot their leader has the sacred case in his hands
the metal handle is missing but the second metal glove is still grasping the case
pretending to be worried aknot
is that you
the leader nods
a disgusted look stamps zorgs features
what an ugly face
doesnt suit you at all
take it off
aknots face burns away revealing the head of a monstrous mangalore
never be ashamed of who you are
aknot says nothing but if his eyes could talk
so what if the federal army crushed your entire race and scattered your people to the wind
your time for revenge is at hand
he takes out a weapon from one a crate and goes into a sales pitch
very fast its light
the handles adjustable for easy carrying
good for righties and lefties
meanwhile two men set up a mannequin rigged with various defense mechanisms at the far end of the warehouse
breaks down into four parts undetectable by x rays
its the ideal weapon for quick discreet interventions
a word on fire power titanium recharger
round clip with bursts of to
with the replay button another zorg innovation its even easier
he fires at the mannequin
and replay sends every following shot to the same location
zorg spins around the rounds all hit the mannequin
even faster i recharge but the enemy has launched a cowardly sneak attack from behind the automirror takes care of that
gives me the time to turn around and finish the job
round bursts then there are the zorg oldies
he fires off each item he names
the always efficient flame thrower
our famous net launcher the arrow launcher with exploding or poisonous gas heads very practical
and for the grand finale the all new ice cube system
the mannequin has been blasted into a pile of ashes covered by a net
stuck with arrows the whole mess frozen solid
he tosses the weapon into aknots hands
four full crates delivered right on time
what about you my dear aknot did you bring me what i asked you for
aknot sets the case on a crate
zorg gloats while stroking the case
zorg smiles takes a deep breath opens the case
its empty leeloo breaks into her childish laughter once again
astonished what do you mean empty
aknot looks into the case
things grow tense
ive got an open mind here
anyone care to explain
leeloo explains what happened in her language
translating she says that the guardians never really had much faith in humans
they were afraid of being attacked
the stones were given to someone they could trust who took another route
shes supposed to contact this person in a little less than twelve hours from now in a hotel
shes looking for the address
a map of the stars flashes onto the screen leeloo points
the little group comes over to look
planet fhloston in the angel constellation cornelius plops down into his armchair
zorg calmly closes the case and gives aknot a blood chilling stare
you asked for a case
we brought you a case
shouting a case with four stones in it
not two or three
what the fuck am i supposed to do with an empty case
aknots men grow edgy
tense we are warriors not merchants
humored but you can still count
he holds up four fingers
four stones four crates
yelling to his men put everything back were outta here
aknots warriors turn their weapons on zorg
icily we risked our lives
i believe a little compensation is in order
smiling so you are a merchant after all
to his men leave them one crate
for the cause
zorgs men leave a crate and exit with the other three
zorg walks along the street to his limo
right arm carries the empty case
i dont like warriors
theyre too narrow minded no sublety
worse they fight for hopeless causes
honor has killed millions of people but hasnt saved a single one
pause you know what do i like though i like killer
a real dyed in the wool killer
a killer when he picked up the zf wouldve immediately asked about the little red button on the bottom of the gun
the warriors have all taken a weapon
one of them inspects his zf
he turns it over and notices the little red button
he presses it
behind zorg an ear shattering explosion levels the warehouse
impassive bring the priest
korben is finishing a thai meal cooked by a thai on his mini restaurant anchored at the window
the cat eats next to korben contented
so you forgive me
the cat meows just as a red light blinks announcing the arrival of a message in a glass tube
korben ignores it
not going to open
ive never gotten a message that wasnt bad news
how someone strong like you scared from a message
is good news i sure
the last two messages i got
the first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving
and the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too
with my wife
you right that is bad
but mathematically luck must change
grandfather say it never rain every day
this is good news guarantee
i bet you lunch
korben hesitates then gives the envelope to the thai who opens it with a big smile that fades as reads the contents aloud
korben smiles at him
at least i won lunch
see good in bad
i prepare number one dessert
special for you and pussy
the cat meows
leeloo is polishing of an immense pile of dessert as david bangs away at the computer
i got it
everything here we need to know about fhloston paradise hotel
and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel
good work my son
now all we need is a way to get there
the doorbell rings
ill get it
finish your work my son
cornelius opens to right arm with armed escort
zorg would like a word with you
zorg turns to cornelius
jean baptiste emmanuel zorg
nice to see you again i remember you now
the so called art dealer
im glad you got your memory back father
because youre going to need it
where are the stones
why on earth do the stones interest you
personally they are of no interest to me id rather sell weapons
but i have a customer
so tell me
even it i did know where the stones were i would never tell somebody like you
whats wrong with me
im a priest
im here to serve life all you want to do is destroy it
you are so wrong
let me explain
zorg leads cornelius into his inner office
would you like a drink
no thank you
life which you so nobly serve comes from destruction
look at this empty glass
zorg pushes the glass with his finger
here it is
but if it is
zorg pushes the glass off the table
it shatters on the floor
small individual robots both free wheeling and integrated come zipping out to clean up the mess
look at all these little things
so busy all of a sudden
notice how each one is useful
what a lovely ballet so full of form and color
so full of
they are robots
a servant comes in pours water in another glass
zorg tosses a cherry into it
by that simple gesture of destruction
i gave work to at least fifty people today
the engineers the technicians the mechanics
fifty people who will be able to feed their children so they can grow up big and strong
children who will have children of their own adding to the great cycle of life
cornelius sits in silence
father by creating a little destruction i am in fact encouraging life
so in reality you and i are in the same business
destroying a glass is one thing
killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another
let me reassure you father
i will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last years
zorg smiles holds up the glass and takes a drink
unfortunately he chokes on the cherry
unable to breathe zorg starts to panic
mocking wheres the robot to pat your back
zorg falls writhing on his desk inadvertently hitting buttons which trigger a slew of little mechanisms
they pop out all over the desk
true chaos reigns
even a cage appears holding a souliman aktapan a fat multicolored beastie picasso who seems surprised to be out in daylight
he licks his half dead master in thanks
cornelius gets up and walks around the desk
zorg motions for help
can i give you a hand
cornelius whacks him on the back
the cherry comes flying out
zorg regains control of himself
guards come running in
you saved my life
so im going to spare yours
to the guards throw him out
the guards throw cornelius out
you are a monster zorg
complimented i know
the guards drag cornelius out of the office
torture whoever you want the president if you have to but i want those stones
you have an hour
right arm salutes and hurries out of the office
the dark planet
three warships are positioned in front of it
communication satellites arrive from all over the place drawn to it like a magnet
observing its gobbling up all the communication satellites in the galaxy
president lindberg appears even more crushed by recent events
why the hell is it eating up all those satellites like that
desperate were working on it mr
were working on it
it should only choke on them
munro enters the office just as a cockroach crawls onto the desk
theres a small antenna on its back
zorgs right arm wears earphones monitoring the presidents conversation with the cockroach spy
i managed to contact the mondoshawan
they deplore the incident but accept our apologies
relieved and the stones
did you find them in the wreckage
the stones werent aboard the ship
surprised what do you mean
the president is all ears
so is zorgs right arm
the mondoshawan never fully trusted the human race
they felt were too unpredictable
so they gave up the stones to somebody they do trust
her name is plavalaguna
shes a diva and shes going to sing at the charity ball on fhloston paradise in a few hours
she has the stones with her
the president breathes easier
zorgs right arm is delighted
taking off a shoe excellent
the president crushes the cockroach with his shoe
right arms earphones fly off his head
good bye eardrums
i want your best man on this
dont worry sir
i have the perfect one
the most disgusting dessert ever made
korben looks at it shimmying on a plate as the thai serves it to him proudly
stewed jellyfish cake
korben forces a weak polite smile as the thai looks on expectantly
the phone rings
saved by the bell
korben rises to get his cigarettes and answer the phone
youre the nastiest dirtbag i know in this stinking city
resigned hi ma
ive been playing twice a week for years years ive been eating those shitty croquettes
korben goes to light his cigarette
there are only two matches left in the match box
korben strikes one and it fizzles
you wouldnt even eat one to help your poor mother and you win the big prize
the whole thing makes me sick
the thai starts to clean up
just as korben goes to strike the second match
are you listening to me you ingrate
resigned yes ma
korben sighs and puts the match back in the box
korben enters his code on the keypad the thai is holding
to the thai go on
this is gonna take a while
the thai casts oft
korben closes the window
other than that
you all right
and now youre making fun of me
im warning you
if you dont take me after all these years of sacrifice ill never forgive you
the thai flies off
in the hall the cat meows for more food
to the cat im coming
ma whatre you talking about
i get it
you want to make me beg is that it
all i want is an explanation
i just got in i lost my job
i smashed my cab
i got mugged but other than that everythings peachy ma thanks for asking
now settle down and explain to me calmly
a message drops in his tube
the red light goes on
you just won a trip you dolt
ten days in fhloston paradise for two
if id won id know about it
someone would have notified me
theyve been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour blockhead
he eyeballs the message still in the tube
the doorbell rings
its the door
ill call you back
korben hangs up before his mother can say anything and heads for the door
before he gets there it opens general munro enters followed by a captain and a major
major iceborg is a woman
all she needs to become a man is a mustache
munro opens a file
clipped major dallas if our calculations are correct you still have hours owed to the federal army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission
of the utmost importance
to save the world
where have i heard this song before
youre to leave immediately for fhloston paradise
retrieve four stones from the diva plavalaguna
and bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible
a little bewildered just one
one as part of the elite special forces unit of the federated army you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission
munro pulls out a long list of documents
two of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated
and the third one
youre the only one left alive
munro removes the message korben hasnt bothered to look at
dont you open your messages
ive had enough good news for today by rote you have won the annual gemini contest and a trip to fhloston paradise
here are your tickets
he hands korben the tickets
korben gets it
you rigged the contest
major iceborg will accompany you
as your wife
the idea of taking a trip with iceborg makes him sick
sarcastic you couldnt come up with something a little more discreet
old tricks are the best tricks eh
im not going
i want to stay the only one left alive
leeloo and cornelius search for korbens apartment
leeloo carries the card korben gave her
cornelius finds the apartment and yanks the
number off the door
he waves leeloo over as his hand goes to the bell
the doorbell rings
korben goes to the door and looks out the peephole the beautiful leeloo
korben panics overcome with happiness
worried what is it
korben has two seconds to make up something to get rid of munro
its my wife
i thought you were divorced
i mean my future
my future ex
if she sees you here im finished
she hates you guys
its what killed us in the first place
he puts them in the fridge shoving the jellyfish cake in iceborgs hands
sorry general but weve got no choice
itll only take a minute
let me set up another meeting and ill be back
three of us will never fit in there
pushing him oh yes you will
korben slams the fridge door
the doorbell rings again
he whips through his place in ten seconds gathers up things laying about shuts drawers rolls up his laundry in the folding bed
he brushes his hair back and opens the door with a big smile only to discover a gun stuck between his eyes held by cornelius
i suppose that means hi
im sorry to have to resort to such methods but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to fhloston
is that the usual way priests go on vacation
were not going on vacation
were on a mission
what kind of mission
sincere we have to save the world
skeptical good luck
father i was in the army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was i
lost a lot of friends
so thanks for the offer
but no thanks
cornelius is disappointed
leeloo looks crestfallen
this is a police control action
everyone freezes as the whole building resounds with the electronic voice
a group of policemen bursts into the hallway
one of the cops enters a code on the police wall box
a device descends from the ceiling a flashing light siren a voice fills the air
this is not an exercise
this is a police control
cornelius starts to panic
korben takes charge
oh my god oh my god
korben pushes a button sending the fridge to the next floor
a shower takes its place
leeloo hide in here and dont move
leeloo hops in
korben tosses cornelius on the bed
what are you doing
trying to save your ass so you can save the world
and hits a button on the wall
the bed disappears into the wall
korben grabs his tickets and slides them in his belt
meanwhile the automatic police voice continues
spread your legs and place your hands in the yellow circles please
a cop slaps a viewer device on korbens door which makes part of it transparent
put your hands in the yellow circles please
korben takes his time hiding his face
the cop looks at his sheet
hes looking for a
he has his picture but it is korben with long hair and beard
to cop sir
are you a human
no im a meat popsicle
at the other end of the hall i found him
korbens calling card is clumsily stuck to the door of the neighbors apartment
cop slaps the viewer on the nasty neighbors door
the neighbor is at his sink shaving instead of against the wall cop arrives with korbens picture
sir this is a control
please put your hands in the yellow circles
the neighbor steps right up to the viewer shaving cream on his face
he could pass for korben
korben still has his hands to the wall
the riot police hustle down the hall dragging the neighbor behind them in a canvas bag
a cop is on the wall phone
ok we got the guy under wraps
right arm is on the phone facing zorg
it was not easy but we bagged him
thanks for the tip
smiling glad to help
he hangs up
they just arrested the guy for uranium smuggling
everythings going as planned
he shows him a plane ticket and a passport with his picture and korbens name
all i have to do now is to go to the airport and take his place
i should be in fhloston in less than four hours
zorg sits there quietly for a moment
dont come back without the stones
korben opens the shower door
leeloo is soaking wet her teeth chattering from the cold
im really sorry
there wasnt time
his eyes fall on an old blanket
here let me wrap you up
korben wraps her in an blanket and vigoroualy rubs her back
leeloo warms gradually and snuggles closer to that warm comfortable shoulder
korbens rubbing slows looking more like caresses
ive met you twice today and youve ended up in my arms both times
leeloo suddenly realizes that she has maybe gone a bit too far
she recovers looking embarrassed too
nicely valo massa
the intimacy makes him nervous
he looks for a diversion
thats what you need
a nice hot cup of coffee
he pushes a button on the coffee machine
with some honey
youll see honeys great
korben rummages through the drawer
leeloo innocent doesnt seem to quite understand everything that is going on
a hot cup of coffee
he rummages through the cupboard exceedingly nervous
leeloo smiles and begins to look around
she opens a drawer and comes upon
nervously ive got this great honey somewhere
you know about honey
there used to be these little animals who made it with antenna
pictures of major korben dallas war hero
and these other animals who ate it
one were bees the other were bears
she looks back to the man fumbling for honey
i forget which ate it and which made it but
and she smiles
here it is
korben holds up the jar of honey
leeloo innocently sticks his finger in the jar then puts it in her mouth
melts in your mouth doesnt it
she savors the honey slowly sensually
her lips shine with honey
her eyes narrow with pleasure
korben is hypnotized by her lips like a moth attracted to a flame
he begins to lose control which makes him nervous
an indistinct sound comes from the wall
but korben is so entranced with the sight of leeloo licking her honied fingers he doesnt hear it until it becomes quite a racket
you hear that
korben pushes the button on the wall
the bed pops out fully made with cornelius tucked in it struggling to get out
im really sorry
let me help you
korben begins to pull at the covers when
achta ge lumitai de matala
he turns to leeloo struggling out of her wet clothes
his breath is taken away by the sight of her perfect body
cornelius whacks him heavily on the head with a lamp
korben drops to the floor
displeased vano da mechteba
soun domo kala chon hammas
no im not proud of myself
but we dont have the luxury of choice
the police exit the elevator and head for the front door
a cop suddenly takes a hit from a silencer then a second
others are bashed on the head by mangalore warriors
one of them picks up the prisoner bag takes it into a small shed
aknot the mangalore leader is seriously wounded and cant walk
we got him
take command akanit
go to fhloston and get the stones
if zorg really wants them
hell have to negotiate
revenge is at hand
korben gets unsteadily to his feet some blood drips down his face
he daubs at it
the phone rings he manages to answer
have you pulled yourself together
he hangs up
korben opens the fridge door
the three officers are frozen solid
korben grabs some ice presses it to his forehead
ill take the mission
he closes the door
cornelius and leeloo still damp arrive at the manhattan intergalactic airport
a huge hall three quarters filled with trash piled up to the ceiling
there are groups of extra terrestrials on strike standing in trash holding picket signs
a security guard picks up a phone off the wall
illegal gathering in zone
a hand taps leeloo from behind
she whips around catching david in the face
leeloo be careful
he turns to david who in holding his bloody nose
did you get them
david hands cornelius two passports
he hands it to her
the name makes her smile
and korben david dallas
akta dedero ansila do mektet
i cant pretend to be your husband
davids in great shape
she looks at david holding his bloody nose
hell protect you
see the diva
get the stones
see you at the temple
god be with you
angle on korben comes rushing into the airport
walking quickly he scopes the hall looking for leeloo
a police patrol bearing down on the strikers jostles him
the cops open fire
the strikers dive into the garbage and disappear
david nervously puts tickets and ids on the check in counter
leeloo tosses her suitcase on the conveyor belt
congratulations on winning the contest
david gives her a bleak smile
leeloo rolls her eyes
back a ways korben has spotted leeloo and
he heads right for them
leeloos seen him
she is both delighted and panicked
davids seen nothing
korben presses one of his fingers like a gun to davids back
i really thought i was going to miss my flight
to david thanks kid
you put the luggage on the conveyor belt
now beat it
paralyzed david leaves
korben turns to the attendant
i was so afraid id miss the flight that i sent the kid here to pick up my boarding card
he looks at davids fake id
my cousin david
leeloo is unable to hold back a smile
looking at leeloos id your wife
korben grabs the id and reads it
aside you know how it is
love at first sight
you meet something goes tilt

leeloo rips her boarding card out of the attendants hand
sharply dinoine chagantakat
took the words right out of my mouth
ill be right with you
to check in attendant its our honeymoon

he winks at the stewardess
the neighbor and a tawdry young girl cross the airport
the couple in almost knocked over by a police patrol holding a pound pig on a stainless steel leash
the couple panics a moment the realize the patrol isnt for them
the pig heads for the pile where the strikers disappeared
to pig come on snyffer go root
the pig piles into the garbage
the cop cuts it some slack
cornelius sits at a bar
to the bartender i feel so guilty sending her to do the dirty work
i know she was made to be strong but shes also so fragile
you know what i mean
the bartender a robot nods his head as he pours cornelius a drink
the nasty neighbor and his wife hand their tickets to the check in attendant
in a different voice yes thats me
the check in attendant triggers a transparent blue light that shines on their faces revealing two other faces mangalores
smiling just a minute please
she hits a silent alarm but the mangalores feel something is wrong
well be right back
were gonna check out the duty free
they spin around and hurry away
cornelius at the bar half in the bag
make that two
cornelius turns to david
on the plane
the real one
its all my fault
im the servant
its my mission
he hands david the temple key from around his neck
heres the key to the temple
prepare for our arrival
cornelius tosses davids drink into his own downs it all in one shot and takes off passing the mangalore couple headed for the exit
they are very nervous
a police patrol is coming
this time it seems to be for them
to the tawdry girl tell aknot plan a flopped
tell him to go to plan b
the tawdry girl nods and peels off
the neighbor takes out a gun and blasts away at the cops
the cops fire back
a firefight rages in the hall
the tawdry girl dives into a pile of garbage and disappears
into walkie talkie send in a back up unit zone
on one side of the hall a trap door opens
three pigs come running out grabbed by their police handler
cornelius waits until everyone has left gets down on all fours and crawls through the trapdoor reserved for the pigs
leeloo stands at the buffet in the first class lounge eating everything in sight
korben is led down the hall by a stewardess
you are so lucky
loc rhod is the coolest dj in the universe
i dont want to be interviewed
id prefer to remain anonymous
the stewardess stops in the corridor
youll be doing loc rhods live show every day from to

the stewardess smiles and shakes her head
the door next to him suddenly swings open and smashes him in the face
in walks loc rhod amidst a tornado of music and security guards
he is young good looking eccentric charming as an elf or sly as a fox
a bundle of energy
he is the th centurys most popular dj

the stewardess shivers
a beep is heard
end of transmission
the music suddenly stops
several assistants come and compliment loc rhod who sighs lights up a cigarette and drops his pretense
korben sweetheart do me a favor i know this is probably the biggest thing that ever happened to you in your inconsequential life
but ive got a show to do here and its got to pop
so tomorrow when were on air give me a hand

korben grabs him by the collar and drags him into a corner
loc rhods feet dont touch the ground
pissed i didnt come here to play dumbo on the radio
so tomorrow between and give yourself a hand that clear pal
the check in attendant has two more tickets in her hand
alter a moment reading mr
zorgs right arm gives her a big smile
the attendant scans the id with a yellow beam it checks out and the blue light reveals no other face but his
the problem is i only have one korben dallas on my list
and hes already checked in
right arms smile shatters
hes in j
i mean there must be some mistake
i have my ticket
im the real korben dallas
a shrill bell rings out
smiling im sorry sir boarding is finished
the attendant hits a button
a thick window slowly slides up between them
right arm totally loses it
i want to see your boss
get rid of this fucking window
somebodys made a mistake goddamnit
he pounds on the counter with both fists
a steel curtain comes down
red sighting beams target spots on his body ten gun barrels protrude from the wall all aimed at him
this is not an exercise
this is a police control
put your hands in the nearest yellow circles
slowing down sorry my fault
just a little overexcited
im calm now
korben makes his way in the plane looking for his seat
no more seats in modern planes just individual travel boxes lined up like microwaves
he passes steward holding his bloodied nose
he has found what he is looking for
he enters to
leeloo quietly stretched out in front of a computer screen
korben slips in beside her
leeloo in concentrating on the words that scroll rapidly past her on the screen
he doesnt understand what she is doing
not hard to find you
just follow the chaos
leeloo smiles as if complimented
leeloo listen to me
theyre not mine
i mean they are but not for vacation like everyone thinks
im on an operation
and if i didnt come get you youd be in a shitload of trouble
id love to be on vacation with you
now ive got to work
i would love to work in peace
leeloo types in love on the keyboard
but love isnt the operative word here peace is
leeloo types in this new word
rather pleased peace
she brings up a picture of a s style hippie flashing a peace sign
korben sighs and switches off the screen
sometimes you cant learn everything from a screen
sometimes its better to ask someone who has experience
quite happy what is
korben just stares at her for a few minutes
on that subject maybe youd be better off asking the screen
he turns the computer back on
a stewardess walks up the aisle of the shuttle pushing the red buttons on top of each individual box
to make your flight as short and agreeable as possible our flight attendants are switching on the timing sleeper which will regulate your sleep during the trip
switching off the screen ok
korben doesnt know if he should laugh or not
you learned languages in five minutes
now its your turn
i learned your language you have to learn mine
i know how to say hello
teach me how to say good bye thats all i need
do you know how we say make love
korben literally melts
to himself help
luckily a stewardess smiles at him through the box window
sweet dreams mr
the stewardess sets the timing sleeper
korben and leeloo immediately fall asleep
a stewardess at the other end of the shuttle has a problem
loc rhod you have to assume your individual position
hugging her i dont want an individual position i want all positions
resisting somewhat were going to take off soon mr
now youre talking
three crew members prepare for liftoff
on the radio molecular axis authorization
stewardess enters the cockpit
the sleep regulator is ok
checking her out thanks miss
the stewardess leaves with a smile
a red light flashes on the vast control panel
tell the ground crew weve got parasites in the landing gear
a ground crew member goes over to the truck parked under one of the planes wings and bangs on the side of it with a shout
two disinfectors in hermetically sealed suits exit the truck
they go over to the front landing gear and send up a whooshing beam
the flame burns everything it touches
a pack of repugnant creatures falls squealing from the landing gear
a small trapdoor is opened under the shuttle and a huge slightly phosphorescent tube falls out
zorgs right arm is in a phone booth in the middle of the hall
yeah its me
put zorg on
he is already sweating
cold im listening
the real korben dallas is on the plane
he took my place
this is a joke right
loc rhod is wrapped around a stewardess like a snake
i swear to god
ive never been this sincere with a human before
two ground crew members stick an enormous highly phosphorescant tube into the opening
youre fueled and ready to go
have a nice flight
to copilot everything ready for liftoff
weakly to loc rhod no no
im not ready
id like to talk first
i cannot hear you
we have a bad connection here
whats your number
right arm reads off the phone number
ill call you back
the runway is now empty
a man slips out of the shadows
he scurries over to the front landing gear
he pauses for an instant the climbs up the wheel well and disappears inside the shuttle
the pilots are going through the pre flight check list
anti static pressure
the mechanic presses a series of buttons
loc rhod undoes a series of buttons on the stewardess blouse behind a curtain
he whispers a poem
impossible to resist him
outside the curtain the stewardess legs rise slowly
on the ground protective fire curtains rise slowly to contain the engine exhaust on liftoff
a keyboard slowly appears in front of zorg
typing the number
the pilot gradually turns the engines up
the stewardess undergoes a power surge from loc rhod thats about to lift her of
zorg finishes gleefully typing in the number
the engines at full blast
the stewardess in close to screaming
the copilot pushes a button
so does zorg
the engines release their full power
the stewardess screams in ecstasy
in the hall right arm literally explodes along with the phone and everything else within feet
the stewardess legs slowly descend and disappear behind the curtain
in the cockpit the atmosphere loosens up
relaxing landing gear secure
lets light one up
korben and leeloo sleep soundly in their box
leeloo has a smile on her face and her hand in korbens
the spaceship rockets past us then suddenly vanishes with amazing speed
space is now empty and calm
billions of stars glow in perfect silence
the nefarious planet in still there immobile even larger now writhing like a serpent
then suddenly for no apparent reason all activity stops and it becomes gray and cold
in the admirals starship scientists watch the measuring device
one of the devices suddenly starts working
were finally getting something
the head scientist stands facing the president who is looking more tired than ever
the thing is sending out radio wavelengths
what the hell does it want with radio waves
probably wants to make a call
the president and his generals look at him in astonishment
picasso purrs contentedly on zorgs lap
the phone rings
shadow on the line
zorg shoots to his feet
picasso tumbles to the floor
zorg picks up the phone both excited and uneasy
he stands there almost coming to attention
the voice is feeble
it comes from the far reaches of time from the bowels of the universe
am i disturbing you
not at all
where are you
shadows breathing is awesome
not far now
maybe i can get you on my screen and see you at last
zorg brings up a huge screen and pushes a few buttons
in the middle of an electronic snowstorm a blackish vaguely human quiverinq form appears
two eyes like lava give an idea where the head is
zorg feels sick
do you have the picture now mr
hows our deal coming along
ill at ease fine just fine
ill have the pieces you asked for any time now
but it wasnt easy
my costs have tripled
shadow pauses an instant
a black slimy liquid starts to ooze from the top of the screen
zorg is feeling worse all the time
money is of no importance
i want the stones
the black liquid oozes all over the screen which starts to melt
zorg sweats profusely his legs tremble
the stones will be here
ill see to it personally
i cant wait to be among you
zorg sighs and sits down totally freaked
the space shuttle fills the screen
it banks left and begins its descent toward fhloston the turquoise planet
crystal blue water perfect white sand beaches
a true paradise
the stewardess picks up a microphone to make an announcement
ladies and gentlemen we have begun our descent toward fhloston paradise
stewardesses walk down the aisles waking the passengers one by one
they press a button on the door of each box
in the corner loc rhod and the stewardess awake with a start and straighten their clothes quickly
the stewardess is embarrassed
timidly i wanted to tell you that
loc rhod puts on his sunglasses and presses a finger to her lips
he disappears behind the curtain leaving the sighing stewardess on her own
the spaceship descends through some clouds and glides over a vast turquoise sea
fhloston paradise looms into view
an enormous oceanliner floating a dozen yards above the water
on closer inspection it is more modern than a traditional oceanliner
the shuttle draws near looking ridiculously small next to the monster
like a sardine next to a whale
a blinking light goes on
parasites in zone
take a look
the st mate heads off
a stewardess opens korbens box door
he is still heavy with sleep
he looks over at leeloo
shes not there
the tiny space shuttle clings to the huge oceanliner
the pilot maneuvers the ship into its docking area
you can let the passengers out
the st mate pries open the door to an overhead panel
cornelius falls out hanging in a jumble of wires
the enormous door opens and the passengers exit
leeloo is among them
she appears quite impressed by the beauty and luxury of the th century decoration
korben attempts to make his way up the shuttles aisle
jostling everybody pardon me
im trying to reach my wife
a dozen policemen wait patiently at the end of the hall
leeloo stops and presses against the wall
she spots korben leaving the shuttle
a gorgeous hostess comes up to him drapes a lei around his neck and plants a kiss on his lips in welcome
smiling welcome to paradise
korbens face is covered in lipstick
leeloo sees he did nothing to stop the girl and she doesnt like it
a hefty man wearing a sarong drapes some flowers around her neck
then obviously relishing it he leans down to kiss her
leeloo bashes him on the forehead
the hefty man straightens up
hes still smiling but his nose is bleeding
he falls slowly to the floor
korben pushes forward trying to spot leeloo
he also tries to wipe the lipstick off
leeloo tries to escape through a door marked personnel only but its locked
a host looks at her with a grin
playful if you dont have the code you cant open it
leeloo smiles and punches in an old code and twists the doorknob
the door opens with the sound of a braking lock
leeloo smiles sweetly and enters as if nothing were amiss
a shriek of joy fills the room
korben turns around
the hostesses cluster around loc rhod as he comes out of the plane
loc rhod spots korben and latches onto his arm
its not going to be easy to remain discrete
relieved my main man
please dont leave me here alone
my heads killing me and my adoring fans are gonna tear me apart
get me outta here
ill take you to the bar after that youre on your own
hanging on to korben oh yes
you treat me right man
tell me all about yourself your roots your personal life your childhood dreams
i dont think this is a good time
you got brothers and sisters
what about your dad
tell me about your dad
what was he like
big i suppose
evasive yeah very big a giant
i didnt have a dad
never saw him
never even heard him
billion people listen to me every day
and he doesnt hear me
leeloo is in a small room ear at the door listening
everything seems normal
she turns and discovers the room for what it is a rest room for
three cops who look up from their books and stare blankly at her
leeloo doesnt know what to do
so she smiles
the door opens
the hostess turns on the light and enters
korben follows her gaping at all the luxury
the baggage boy enters bringing leeloos two suitcases
korben grabs the notice announcing diva plavalagunas concert at in that evening
dress formal attire
for the concert it says formal attire
i didnt bring
the hostess pulls back the closet door
twenty tuxedos in a row
looking him over heres some champagne
ill drop by after the concert to open it
she gives him a blinding smile and closes the door
korben pushes a button
the curtains open to reveal a most spectacular view of the turquoise planet
stars shoot out into infinity
korben stands gaping
the phone rings snapping him out of his reverie
you little sleaze bag
dont you ever ask me for another thing in my life again youve killed your poor mother with your own hands
korben drops into an armchair and sighs
his eyes go to the ceiling
the chief of police has cornelius in front of him handcuffed
the divas ship is coming in
i want maximum security
to cornelius ok lets hear it
where was i
bored you open the door
theres a cabby with a girl in his arms
fog opens the door
two cops come hobbling in all bloody and bandaged
they hold up a third cop
a bomb go off in your face
a foot inch bomb
with green eyes
cornelius perks up
and the smile of an angel
they all turn to look at him
to chief may i speak to you alone
leeloo watches the divas arrival
a door opens and two policeman clear the way for diva plavalaguna her manager her bodyguards and a gaggle of porters carrying trunks
not wanting to draw attention to herself leeloo feigns interest in a painting that is obviously upside down
a white chiffon veil covers the face of the diva she stops in front of leeloo
the diva reaches out and strokes leeloos face without touching her
the diva removes her hand making a sound of crackling electricity then passes on
leeloo is groggy
the divas assistant comes up to her
please forgive this little incident
she wants you to know that she senses great powers in you
in the service of a noble cause
she will give you what you have come to get but she wants to sing first
one last time
the divas assistant turns the painting right side up
leeloo looks at the painting seems to understand it better
policemen stand at attention in front of the divas suite
hello im head of security
everything is in order
the diva enters her suite without letting him finish
make yourselves at home safely
if you need anything
give it a knock
a door opens near the police officers main entrance
cornelius looks both ways
then crosses the hall dragging the chief of police by the feet
korben finishes putting on his tux still on the phone
ive only got a few days vacation and ill be damned if im gonna spend them on the phone
the door rings
hang on its the door
i told you i didnt bring anybody
im all alone
korben opens the door
its not the champagne
to his mother ill call you back
leeloo heads right for her suitcase and starts to undress
korben has to turn away once more
here we go again
by rote you know women normally change five times more than men
you get that off the screen
you know theres a lot of differences between men women
ok you can turn around
korben turns around
leeloo has put on a very simple dress which is sexy to the max
he is smitten
so much so that leeloo wonders if something isnt quite right
where you going
im going to see the diva sing
whats the matter
do i look bad
no not at all
i mean just the opposite youre
leeloo smiles at him his compliment pleases her
she turns revealing her unzippered back
korben cannot help but stare at her bare flesh
her perfect bottom
do you know how this works
korbens blood boils
she wriggles pressing her hands together close to the zipper
i have an idea
but instead of pulling on the zipper he slips a bracelet on her wrist
a flourescent beam bursts out of the bracelet and forms a vertical bar going from the floor to the ceiling
stunned leeloo is held captive
i told you i need to work in peace
i need to concentrate
and you cant concentrate with me around
she tries to breakout
leeloo tries desperately to get out of the handcuffs
korben sets the radio down in front of her and turns it on
leeloo looks like shed like to break his head
seething youre nothing but a
the words youre looking for werent in the dictionary you studied
i wont be long
the door flies open
loc rhod barges in
hey stud we gotta
then he sees the scene leeloo cuffed in a low cut dress
his mind goes to the obvious
korben my man whats happening here
whos the chick
whats the gig
we free forming here
getting funky with the monkey
can i get in on this
korben grabs him by the collar
to all of the above
and yanks loc rhod out of the room
leaving leeloo looking extremely unhappy
loc rhod and korben enter what turns out to be a replica of the garnier opera in paris
a hostess escorts them to their seats
broadcasting we have just walked into what is probably the most beautiful concert hall in the universe
magnificent paintings on the ceiling
i dont know who painted them but he must have busted his balls
i see a row of former ministers more sinister than minister
a few generals practicing how to sleep
and theres baby ray star of stage and screen drowning in a sea of nymphets
hes not gonna get much out of this concert hes stone deaf
baby ray bending his ear to a girl asking for an autograph
moving down the aisle and over there is roy von bacon the king of laserball and the best paid player in the league
shakes hands as he goes by and over there is the emperor kodar japhet whose daughter aachen is still at the bar
i love to sing too but in the shower she recently confessed to me
she will no doubt prove to be as generous tonight as she always is
a waiter gives them two glasses of champagne
track with the waiter an he leaves the hall with his empty tray
he enters a small room reserved for staff
the waiter joins some other waiters
they are well armed
he opens a cupboard and pulls out a humongous weapon
suddenly their faces burn off revealing akanit the young leader of the mangalores and his troops
the lights dim slowly in the concert hall
president lindbergh and his staff including munro sit at the desk
leeloo still a prisoner listens to the concert
korben is tense
the curtain rises
the diva in a stunning gown stands in the center of the stage head bowed
behind her a star filled window
the music begins
the diva looks up a rare beauty but an alien
and then she begins to sing
her voice is divine unmatched
korben is swept up in the tears
leeloo has tears in her eyes the manager couldnt care less about the concert
his main problem is the bottle of scotch he cant seem to open
the doorbell rings
ugly mood yeah
flowers for the diva
shes allergic to flowers
theres champagne as well
the manager takes one look at the stubborn bottle and opens the door
and finds himself staring down the barrel of a gun
a dozen mangalores rush in
one of them with a human face closes the door and waits out in the hall
cornelius watching from around the corner
commander i have a ship with a main malfunction
he requests permission to dock for repairs
did you check out his registration number
everythings in order
put him in the docking garage and inform the police
you have an hour
will that be enough time
zorg sits at the controls
cold more than enough
the zfx approaches fhloston
the ship comes close enough for leeloo to see it out the window
the same ships with mangalores at the controls attack the mondoshawans at the beginning of our story
leeloo is alarmed
she has to act
she seizes the flourescent bar beam with great effort and rams it into the ceiling marking a hole large enough for her to escape
cornelius bursts into the closet he left the chief of police tied and gagged in
he quickly unties him
in a panic mangalores
the divas suite
they want the sacred stones
they must be stopped
we must stop them
im going to free you but you must promise to help me
the chief of police nods his agreement
the mangalores have trashed the suite
one of the mangalores finally finds a case engraved with the four elements
i have it
the mangalore is about to open the case when
leeloo descends quietly and gracefully from the ceiling
time stands still
the diva switches from classical music to funk picking up the tempo
a warrior whips out the biggest knife ever made and rushes leeloo
she disarms him gracefully
a violent fight breaks out
the diva sings and leeloo dances
the mangalores pay a heavy price for the show
hearing noise from inside the suite the mangalore by the door gets nervous
he runs for reinforcements
cornelius enters the police station wearing handcuffs
the chief of police is behind him holding a gun
leeloo knocks out the last mangalore just as the diva finishes her song to a burst of applause
the diva takes a bow
so does leeloo
akanit and his men listen to the concert
the mangalore guard runs in
they were waiting for us
it was an ambush
if its war they want its war theyll get
enact the final plan
all the mangalores cock their weapons
leeloo is about to open the case when the door explodes
zorg is there holding a zf
my compliments little lady
and thanks for doing all the dirty work
i couldnt have done it any better myself
sharply now hand over the stones
leeloo smiles and hands him the case
zorg arms the zf and gets ready to kill her
nice knowing you
leeloo catches on quickly
she kicks the scotch bottle on the floor into the gun which throws zorgs shot off
she jumps to the ceiling and disappears in an air vent
furious zorg fires at the ceiling
leeloo dodges the bullets as best as she can
zorg fires his round clip
the ceiling looks like a piece of swiss cheese
zorg sticks a small cylinder in the wall and flicks it on
the numbers flashing by tell us its a bomb
the timer reads minutes and seconds
with a crafty smile you can run but you cant hide
cornelius is seated opposite the chief of police
a medic is bandaging the chiefs head
the door explodes
the cop outside in riddled with bullets
a dozen mangalores attack the police office
akanit is at their head
the policemen are caught unaware
were taking over this ship
the chief of police is goggle eyed
cornelius leans toward him
pleased with himself i told you
zorg has the case and exits the suite just as the general alarm goes off
he sighs in exasperation
three mangalores suddenly rush into the opera hall shooting
there is panic all around
broadcasting panic stricken ladies and gentlemen i think were being
the place is crawling with warriors
president lindberg and his generals look very worried
some security guards open fire one of the mangalores is hit
the others turn their guns on the cops
people scream diving for cover
korben bides his time
more mangalores rush in from all around shooting
two cops are killed
takes a bullet
she falls from the stage into korbens arms
he lowers her to the floor
korben ignores the panic all around and wraps her in his dinner jacket trying to stop the blue blood spurting from her wounds
zorgs zfx speeds away from the boat
zorg is at the controls a devilish smile on his lips
you want something done do it yourself
fighting rages all around in the concert hall but korben is oblivious to it
he sets the divas head delicately on the floor
loc rhod is hidden nearby still on the air
voice low panicked theyre hideous
theyve got a crest on the head the eyes of a toad and fingers all over their hands
send a battalion out immediately
to the diva i was sent by the government to help you
this is my fate
how was the concert
korben is a little surprised but
the diva is an artist
ive never heard anything so beautiful in my life
a mangalore jumps on them from the stage
korben makes short work of him and grabs his gun
weak youre a good man
she was right to have chosen you
the fifth element
the supreme being
korben is floored
yes and more than that
you must give her the stones shes the only one who knows how to use them
to himself suddenly realizing so cornelius was telling the truth
the mangalores tie up cornelius and the chief of police together
to the chief of police of course i was telling you the truth
if you had listened to me in the first place we wouldnt be in this predicament now
korben wastes two more mangalores
she needs you
she needs your help and your love
shes more fragile than she seems
korben looks around ready for another attack
yeah so am i
the diva takes his hand
she was taught to love the life of others
but not her own
you have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live
uncomfortable ill help her i promise but i think you should tell me where the stones are
do you love her
i dont know
we hardly know each other
it takes time
i dont have time
i need to know
listen the last time i admitted to a woman i loved her
i never saw her again
i would like to have died in peace
the divas eyes close
the timer on zorgs bomb clicks over to minutes
you tell me to save the world then you go off and leave me in the shit
he shakes her gently slapping her cheeks
youre not gonna die in peace
youre not going to die at all
you hear me
where are the stones
zorg sets the sacred case on a table in the cockpit
he opens it with a complacent smile its empty
he cannot believe his eyes
he goes berserk destroying everything in sight
korben slaps the diva soundly
she comes around somewhat
im sorry but
very weak they are
the diva dies
blue blood streams from her mouth
korben frisks the diva but doesnt find anything
the shooting slowly stops in the theatre
the mangalores are now in total control
stay calm and nobody will get hurt
hands on your head and into the hall
the guests comply to himself the stones are with me
and then it occurs to him
he touches the divas stomach and senses something hard
girding himself he sticks his hand in the wound and pulls out a sacred stone
korben pulls out all four stones covered in blue blood
everyone has left the theater
the mangalores check the aisles one by one
loc rhod peeks out from under a seat
dont you think wed better be going
a mangalore spots korben kneeling alongside the diva
he grabs korben by the shoulder and pokes him with his gun
with the others
korben spins and in one swift motion breaks his arm
just for starters
another warrior rushes over
korben punches him into oblivion and snatches the gun
all day people have been sticking guns in my face
korben wraps up the four stones in his shirt
these dudes are going to waste us if we dont do what they say
korben gives him the package and grabs his mike
you dont do what i say
ill waste you myself
president lindberg dabs his sweaty face with a towel
akanit is still in the police station facing control screens
he barks into a walkie talkie
whats the situation in the hall
hostages are being gathered in the middle of the hall
they are surrounded by mangalores who guard them
into walkie talkie theres no more resistance
everythings under control
three mangalores are suddenly blasted through the glass door leading to the theater
korben bursts into the hall two huge guns in his hands
korben takes out two more warriors coming towards him rolls behind a column
laser bullets stinging all around his head
this is amazing
korben korben dallas the winner of the gemini croquette contest just killed three warriors like he was swatting flies
heavy firing fills the hall
roy von bacon the laserball player rises from the floor behind a mangalore grabs him and smashes his head into a column seizing the gun
two mangalores firing a huge machine gun at the column korben is using for cover
he dives for cover behind the bar
two mangalores watch awestruck
roy whistles behind them
the two mangalores turn around
roy bonks their heads together
its roy von bacon the lions center forward joining in the battle
someone taps loc rhod on the shoulder
he jumps with fright
hot to trot all this is terribly exciting hmmm
loc rhod covers his mike
a mangalore shoots in their direction
loc rhod flattens himself on the floor
a vase falls on the princess knocking her out
a mangalore loads some missiles in his gun and destroys the bar piece by piece forcing korben to move forward
korben motions to baby ray hiding under the pool table
toss me the balls
terrified still deaf what
another piece of the bar explodes
the balls for christs sake
korben apes playing pool but baby ray really is stone deaf
he wants the balls
you deaf or something
the emperor rolls the balls over to korben
the mangalore loads more missiles and shatters another part of the bar
korben hides behind the last bit left
how far is he from here
the emperor glances at the mangalore who in reloading
id say about thirty yards to the left
korben hefts the ball jumps up and hurls it with blinding speed
the mangalore catches it right in the head
he drops firing in the air
the missile strikes the ceiling which collapses on him
the emperor gives korben a thumbs up
and our man korben has literally knocked out the opposition with an amazing foot pitch
the cops on the floor rise scoop up weapons from dead mangalores and lay down a line of fire at the last of the fleeing rebels
roy whirls his arm in victory
thanks for your help
korben grabs loc rhod and takes him with him
korben bursts into the room
he stares at the luminous bar still struck to the ground and sees the hole leeloo escaped through
leeloo in bleeding all over
she can barely move
the zfx speeds back toward fhloston paradise
the bomb timer now reads minutes
the last of the mangalores have barricaded themselves in the back of the station and shoot at anything that tries to enter
korben joins the policemen already there
hey who are you
the winner of the gemini croquette contest
korben goes to the door and peeks around the corner
loc rhod arrives
seven to the left
five to the right
whats he doing
korben leans around the corner and fires rapidly
six to the left
one to the right
hes on vacation
reloading we got to find the leader
mangalores dont fight without a leader
akanit gets up grabs cornelius by the throat and put a gun to his head
one more shot and we start killing hostages got that
tense send someone to negotiate
mind if i go
im an excellent negotiator
sure go ahead
korben gets ready
were sending someone in whos authorized to negotiate
korben walks quickly into the room heads straight for akanit raises his gun and puts a bullet through his head
anyone else want to negotiate
to another cop whered he learn to negotiate like that
the president gives munro a hard look
the police round up the remaining mangalores
korben is at the control center screens trying to find leeloo
cornelius comes over to him embarrassed
youre probably very angry with me and i quite understand
but i want you to know im fighting for a noble cause
yeah i know
to save the world
but right now all i want to do is save leeloo
leeloos in trouble
when is she not in trouble
have you tried the divas suite
korben realizes that cornelius in probably right
the zfx settles in the landing dock garage
security police approach the ship just as zorg in getting out holding the zf
nothing i cant fix myself
he brings up the zf and wipes out the garage
korben enters the divas suite which is in shambles
he looks everywhere but finds nothing
leeloo lies in a pool of blood
she hears something below her
exhausted loc rhod wipes his forehead and finds himself face to face with the bomb stuck on the wall
korben in busy looking for leeloo
up in the airshaft leeloo has heard him
her voice is too weak korben cant hear her
what the hell is this
korben gives the bomb a prefunctory glance
a molecular bomb
three minutes left on the timer
increasingly worried and uh whatre these numbers clicking by
probably the time remaining before it explodes
cornelius smiles and continues his search
weak smile youre just saying that to scare me
if it was a bomb an alarm wouldve gone off
theres bomb detectors in all these hotels
a general alarm goes off
loc rhod is crushed
the lights flicker
this is a type a alert
for security reasons the hotel must be evacuated
please proceed calmly to the lifeboats located in the main hallways
a wave of panic engulfs the hall
the cops are unable to hold back the crowd as it stampedes to the exits
zorg marches down the corridor shooting everyone in his path
loc rhod stands paralyzed in front of the flashing timer
less than two minutes left
maybe we oughta be going what do you think
not without leeloo
loc rhod cannot take his eyes off the bomb
like d man i hate to bother you but uh like were down to minutes here
korben breathes out bothered
he turns his attention to the bomb
its the latest model
ive never seen one before
it works off a magnetic coded card
lets see if i can rig it up
leeloo sticks her fingers out one of the bullet holes and lets some of her blood drip down
the blood splats on korbens hand
he snaps his head up and knows immediately who is up there
he forgets about the bomb
what are you doing
korben drags the desk over jumps on it and pokes his head in the torn up airshaft he spots leeloo who gives him a weak smile
dont worry im here now
he pulls her toward him helps her out of the shaft and stretches her out on the desk
ive got the stones
everythings going to be fine
seconds left on the timer
falling to pieces like korben can i have seconds of your time here
to leeloo ill be right back
korben dashes over to the bomb
he is stopped by the barrel of the zf
zorg in person holding a magnetic card
smiling allow me
zorg slips a small magnetic card in the bomb it starts to count down from minutes
just for the fun of it
loc rhod faints
well what do we have here
is this korben dallas
the famous winner of the gemini croquette contest
or is this korben dallas from special section sent by old lindberg himself
korben doesnt reply
in any event whoever you are i was glad to meet you
zorg fires at korben who figures he is dead
zorg tries again
the clip is empty
zorg starts to panic
a round clip
i didnt fire off rounds
dont you know how to count
its not all that hard
korben punches him square in the face shows him his index
thats for trying to kill me
thats for firing me
thats for pushing around a priest
and the rest is for what you did to my wife
korben pummels him mercilessly
president lindberg prefers closing his eyes
munros shoulders move as if he were beating on zorg
zorg falls to the floor beaten to a pulp
the timer clicks over to minutes
were outta here
he picks leeloo up in his arms
cornelius grabs loc rhod and gives him a resounding slap
are you nuts father
i cant feel my teeth
doesnt matter all you need are your legs
the lifeboats launch from the hotel and fly out into space
korben carrying leeloo cornelius and loc rhod are in the garage
two minutes to complete evacuation
korben bursts the lock on the first ship he finds and enters followed by cornelius and loc rhod
zorg starts to come around
korben sets leeloo down
zorg picks up his zf unaware of the bomb and the countdown
i didnt fire three thousand rounds
one minute to total evacuation
you know how to fly this thing
concentrating its like a cab isnt it
anyone know how to release the lines on this crate
zorg is busy with the zf when the bomb starts to beep signaling the last ten seconds
zorg is terror stricken
he pushes a button and holds the zf over his head
loudly maximum protection
a mauve colored magnetic shield closes around zorg like an indestructible sarcophagus
cornelius and loc rhod are bent over the buttons looking for a way to release the lines
loc rhod searches frantically
i dont even know what im looking for
korben slams the throttle into full forward
the ship roars away ripping the lines to shreds
loc rhod is thrown to the rear of the ship
the counter goes
the suite disintegrates the corridor is consumed
the main hall is no more
the zfx jets away as the enormous oceanliner explodes behind it
the ship stops shaking
that was a close one
solid little jobs arent they
broadcasting exhausted dear listeners your favorite dj is alive and kicking
its seven oclock and time for the news
tune in tomorrow for another adventure
end of transmission
loc rhod lets out a huge sigh
to the others the best show i ever did
a magnetic sarcophagus crosses the fhloston sky and crashes into a glacier
zorg appears in the middle of the ice
he takes a portable phone out of the zf
can you hear me better now
zorg i hear you perfectly
so how was the concert
who gives a shit
i didnt come here to listen to music
listen up instead of running off at the mouth
the batteries on my phone are almost gone
dispatch me another zfx immediately
someone stole mine
right away sir
ill send you a new one to the hotel
im not at the hotel
zorg is all alone lost in the middle of the glacier
to himself stay calm
general munro enters the office with a smile
major dallas has the five elements on board
the priest is guiding them directly to the temple
president lindberg closes his eyes in relief
weve been saved
a scientist rushes in
a ball of fire all powerful evil speeds across the screen with three federal army warships following along behind it as best they can
what do you mean its advancing
its not only advancing but its moving at incredible speed
were having trouble following it
to scientist and
do you have any idea where its heading
the scientist is hard to put to answer he shakes his head
korben gently wipes leeloos forehead with a cloth
she opens her eyes a little
gentle loving apipoulai
leeloo smiles weakly feverish
im so very sad
we did pretty well wouldnt you say
five hundred wars
everything you create is used to destroy
i told you not to read all that crap
her eyes close and she falls back asleep
korben is worried
she seems so depressed
theres a general on the phone
his names mambo i think
president lindberg wants to talk to you
hold the line
the president clears his throat and takes the phone
major first off i want to thank you in my name and in the name of the federation
for the praiseworthy courage you have shown us
id like to congratulate general munro for his choice
he found the ideal man for such a
to the point so now whats the problem
the president drops into his armchair and sighs
theres a ball of fire miles in diameter heading straight for the earth
and we have no idea how to stop it
thats the problem
korben thinks fast
the priest is with him
the five elements are on board
how much time before the collision
the president queries the scientist with a nod of the head
if its speed remains constant
in an hour and minutes
ill call you back in two hours
korben hangs up
the president looks stunned
the zfx shifts to the speed of light and vanishes in the star studded cosmos
david is asleep
he is woken by the sound of
the zfx is parked in the middle of the desert
korben walks ahead carrying leeloo
cornelius has the four stones with him
barely awake loc rhod stumbles along
david appears at the door of the chapel
youre all safe
thanks be to god
theres not a minute to lose
the small group enters the chapel
cornelius pushes the group onto the altar which is surrounded by a wooden barrier
cornelius stands in front of the cross
excuse me father but
could we pray later
cornelius bends the cross and pushes it down
a mechanism is set off lowering the altar like a service elevator
the altar descends amid rocky walls
they just landed in the desert
sweating how much time is left
earth is in view
the dark planet fills the screen and heads for the blue planet
about nine minutes
president lindberg has trouble breathing
lit by torches korben sets leeloo delicately on the altar in the exact center of the four elements
cornelius looks over the four stones every which way
panic stricken uh this one
must be water
its obvious he doesnt know where to put it
dont tell me you dont know how all this works
the four stones form the beam and the fifth element is supposed to stand in the middle there but
i dont have the reference book
ive never seen the stones work
korben cant believe his ears
he tears the stone out of cornelius hand and studies the inscriptions
he goes over to one of the four bases the stones rest on and tries to figure it out
the symbol of air is on the stone the same as on the base
match the symbols
korben places the first stone and picks up another one
cornelius has found the symbol for water
loc rhod sits down
he is very tired
what is this some kinda game
korben pulls him to his feet and sticks a stone in his hands
its much simpler
if we dont figure out where these stones go in five minutes were all dead
think you got it
loc rhods got it and runs over to put in his stone
the four stones are all in place but nothing happens
theres no light
you told me there were supposed to be four beams of light
lost yes of course but
the stones are shut
they have to be open for it to work
and you dont know how they open is that what you are saying
thats what im saying
the dark planet closes in on earth rapidly
korben leans over leeloo
we have to open them
how does it work
feeble the wind blows
the fire burns
i know all that leeloo
im talking about the stones
the rain falls
korben is desperate
leeloos too weak he wont get anything more out of her
he darts over to a stone and turns it over and over
the rain falls
the wind blows
loc rhod stands in front of his stone looking at korben
try and figure out how this fucking thing opens instead of staring at me like that
loc rhod starts feeling the stone all around
afraid im looking im looking
the tension is palpable in the presidents office
weve lost contact with them
korben and cornelius turn the stones every which way
all to no avai
loc rhod is discouraged
well never make it
three hooks pop off the stone
loc rhod cant believe his eyes
korben rushes over looks at the stone
hooks are undone
what did you say
what did you do
swear to god i didnt do nothing
look you did something that set it off
try to remember
tell me exactly what you did
loc rhod tries to duplicate the same movement
i was like this
with my hands here and
i said well never make it
is that all
then i sighed
loc rhod sighs really depressed this time
the stone opens even more
korbens got it
the wind blows
korben blows on the stone which immediately opens revealing a patch of blue sky with some miniature clouds floating around inside
a yellow beam pops up like a ray of sunlight like korbens smile
quickly everyone on a stone
water for water
fire for fire
earth for earth
the two men move fast
korben on the th stone earth
he grabs a fistful of earth and throws it on the stone
a miniature patch of green appears and immediately forms a green beam
cornelius wipes his forehead with a scarf and wrings it out over the stone
it opens revealing a patch of miniature raging sea
a blue beam appears
loc rhod has a problem
shaking i dont have a light
i stopped smoking last week
if wed come a bit sooner
korben pats his pockets he comes up with a box of matches
theres only one left
loc rhod and cornelius hold their breath
korben strikes the match
a small flame appears on the tip
a breeze goes through the room
korben feels like hes got tnt in his hands
he approaches the flame to the stone
the flame twists dims flickers
but holds on
the stone opens
a patch of miniature fire appears
korben sighs snuffs out the match
the fourth beam a red one immediately forms
a mass of fire fills the screen
the earth is only a thousand miles away
two more minutes
the president shuts his eyes
his lids move in prayer
korben helps leeloo onto her feet where the four beams and four colors crisscross
its up to you now angel
im so tired
you can sleep tomorrow
i want to sleep
listen to me
ill take you on a vacation afterwards
a real vacation this time for as long as you want
you can do it
korben slowly releases leeloo and steps back from the altar
leeloo can barely stand in the center of the four beams
an indistinct white beam begins to form around her starts to rise
come on leeloo
the beam loses its intensity
leeloo crumples to the floor
the dark planet hurtles toward earth
a hundred miles before impact
the african continent is visible
no doubt about it the fireball is heading right for egypt
seconds tick away relentlessly on the scientists stopwatch
itll be entering the atmosphere in one minute
the heat in the temple is unbearable
all the walls start to ooze the same horrible black slimy liquid seen at zorgs
a drop of liquid falls to the temple floor and begins to smoke eating away at it like acid
loc rhod has to dodge another drop of the stuff
korben quickly straightens leeloo up and puts her back in the center of the beams
if you dont get on with the program were all gonna die
and thats not on my agenda for today
leeloo wraps her arms around korbens neck
weak whats the use of saving lives
when you see what you do with them
youre right but there are lots of good things
but i dont know love
im like a machine programmed to save other peoples lives but never to have one of my own
the scientists stopwatch goes from to seconds
i have thousands of memories but none of them are mine
there is no need for me other than this
im immortal but i have no life
yes you do
i need you
more than you can imagine
stand up straight
why would you need me
to himself tell her for gods sake
a bit of the black acid falls on loc rhods shirt setting it on fire
he rips if off
leeloo has tears in her eyes
the heat is overpowering
black acid is everywhere
i love you
despite her fatigue leeloo smiles broadly
presidents office the stopwatch goes from to
now youre allowed to kiss me
korben wraps his arms around her and kisses her like hes never kissed anybody before
the white beam the divine light immediately forms around leeloo and korben
the stopwatch hits zero
the absolute beam explodes from the top of the pyramid and heads straight into the sky zapping the fireball smack in the middle slowing it down
korben and leeloo kiss like there was no tomorrow
the beam hardens and slowly solidifies the evil planet
inaudible screeches escape from the dying planet
screeches of terrifying pain as if a million souls were dying
streams of black acid spurt from the pyramid and solidify like brilliant stalactites
the pure beam the light of life has finished its work
the dark planet nothing more than a dead planet
strangely enough it looks like the moon
everything is calm around it
president lindberg opens his eyes and realizes hes not dead the planet seems to have stopped at
miles from impact
in the temple the beam loses its intensity
but leeloo and korben remain stuck together lost in their kiss
cornelius has dropped to his knees clutching his hands
loc rhod slips along the wall with a sigh
he gives cornelius a knowing smile
this guy is a killer with the babes
i knew it from the moment i laid eyes on him
cornelius and loc rhod burst out laughing
korben and leeloo keep on kissing
we are in the nucleological laboratory that gave birth to leeloo in the beginning of our story
the president enters the lab followed by a group of officials in ceremonial dress
president let me introduce you to professor mactilburgh who runs the center
its an honor to receive you
where are our two heroes
they were so tired from their ordeal that we put them in the reactor this morning
i have more meetings after this one professor
let me see if theyre revived
we go live in one minute mr
mactilburgh goes to the reactor and opens a small slot which allows him to see what is going on under the blue shield
leeloo and korben are naked arms wrapped around each other kissing and probably engaged in hoppi hoppa
mactilburgh looks troubled
they need five more minutes mr
the president pressed for time looks over to his aide who in struggling with a phone call
who is it
claims shes korbens mother
give it here
the president takes the phone and goes to the window
dallas this in the president
on behalf of the entire federation i would like to thank
dont pull that crap with me finger
id recognize that trash can voice of yours in a dark alley during a rain storm
you tell that worthless no account son of mine he should plotz for the way hes ignored his mother
when i think of all i sacrificed for him
outside the lab we see the president through the window holding the phone away from his ear
pan slowly across manhattan
credits roll as two full rising silver moons ascend in the dark blue sky
