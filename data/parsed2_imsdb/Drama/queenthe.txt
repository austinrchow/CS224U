its election day
up and down the country the people of britain people of all shapes and sizes and denominations black and white young and old are going to the polls
everyone that is except the people that live in
the most instantly recognisable palace in the world
the royal standard the flag of heraldic lions and symbolic harp strings that signals the monarchs presence flutters on the roof
were in a state room at buckingham palace
a tv plays in the corner
heres tony blair just years old arriving at the polling station of his constituency in sedgefield
queen elizabeth ii wearing formal robes of the garter is posing for an official portrait by an elderly black portrait artist representative one assumes of one of the many charities
of which she is patron
have you voted yet mr crawford
proudly dabbing palette yes maam
i was there when they opened
first in line
if he wins hell be the youngest prime minister in almost two hundred years
and i dont mind telling you it wasnt for mr blair
not a moderniser then
were in danger of losing too much thats good about this country as it is
the only questions that still remain how big will his landslide be
and how extensive how sweeping will the modernisation programme be that he ushers in
the queen watches as he paints
i rather envy you being able to vote
a beat not the actual ticking of the box although i suppose it would be nice to experience that once
a beat but the sheer joy of being partial
the artist squints as he scrutinises the canvass
one forgets that as sovereign you are not entitled to vote
still you wont catch me feeling sorry for you
you might not be allowed to vote maam
a beat but it is your government
the queen raises her eyebrow
i suppose that is some consolation
the queens face
its shortly before
daylight filters through the curtains
as does something else
the stirring sound of bagpipes
the inner courtyard of buckingham palace
in a ritual unchanged since queen victoria a uniformed piper wearing a kilt of ancient hunting stuart tartan marches under her majestys windows playing the bagpipes
ts her morning alarm call and its the way she wakes up wherever she is anywhere in the world
a soft knock at the door
the strains of bagpipes can still be heard from below
her majestys dresser sticks her head round the corner with a calling tray of earl grey tea and the newspapers
the dresser puts the tea and newspapers on a bedside table
shall i draw the curtains
the queens sleepy voice answers
the dresser goes to the window
did you stay up
was it as expected
the queens hand reaches for spectacles then for the newspapers
she puts on her glasses
mr blair by a landslide
the queens expression changes
she lifts the newspaper up
the front page comes into sharp focus
full frame the beaming smile of tony blair the new prime minister
the queen stares back
their eyes meet as it were
headlines tell us
the queen sits at breakfast
reading the newspapers
dogs under the table
a knock on the door and robin janvrin s her deputy private secretary pops around
the prime minister is on his way maam
to be robin
correcting terse prime minister to be
the queen frostily flicks a page without looking up
elizabeth contd he hasnt asked my permission yet
the queen and janvrin walk through a corridor of the palace
it has the air of a grand hotel
long gilded mirrors
portraits on the walls
hes a hard one to read isnt he
on the one hand his background is quite establishment
father a conservative
a public school education at fettes where he was tutored by the same man as the prince of wales
well well try not to hold that against him
on the other his manifesto promises the most radical modernisation and shake up of the constitution in three hundred years
is he going to modernise us do you think
i wouldnt put it past him
hes married to a woman with known anti monarchist sympathies you may remember her curtsey the first time you met
it could best be described as shallow
i dont measure the depth of a curtsey robin
i leave that to my sister
and i spoke to the cabinet secretary who said he was expecting the atmosphere at downing street to be very informal
everyone on first name terms
a beat at the prime ministers insistence
as in call me tony
the queens face puckers in distaste
im not sure i like the sound of that
a beat have we sent him a protocol sheet
archive footage as tony blairs motorcade drives down the the motorcade sweeps into the grand inner quadrangle of buckingham palace and stops at the kings door
three secret service bodyguards leap out and open the car doors
tony looks out at the palace
funny im actually rather nervous
youve met her often enough before
but never one to one
and never as prime minister
remember youre a man thats just been elected by the whole country
but shes still yknow
tony looks up at the vast palace in front of him
a uniformed equerry leads tony and cherie through corridors and up a grand staircase
when we reach the audience room i will knock
we will not wait to be called we will go straight inside
standing by the door we bow
from the neck
i will introduce you
the queen will extend her hand you go to her bow again then shake her hand
tony shoots his cuffs right clears his throat
querry contd couple of other things
its maam as in ham not maam as in farm
and when youre in the presence at no point must you show your back
thats what its called when youre in her majestys company
tony turns shoots a look at cherie who sticks her fingers down her throat
tony smiles back
the equerry reaches a grand door and knocks gently
without waiting for a reply he enters
cherie is left in the corridor
she stares at a liveried footman
he stares back
no life behind his eyes
cherie takes a seat on a chair
eyes widen to herself
tony and the equerry enter and gently bow their heads
the equerry then straightens and announces
mr blair your majesty
the queen extends her hand
tony walks forward and shakes it
the equerry leaves
the door is then closed
thank you maam
your children must be very proud
i hope so
youve three havent you
such a blessing
the queen and tony take their seats
have we shown you how to start a nuclear war yet
first thing we do i believe
a beat then we take your passport and spend the rest of the time sending you around the world
you obviously know my job better than i do
well you are my tenth prime minister mr blair
id like to think there werent too many surprises left
my first was winston churchill
he sat in your chair in frock coat and top hat and was kind enough to give a shy young girl like me quite an education
i can imagine
ith time one has hopefully added experience to that education and a little wisdom better enabling us to execute our constitutional responsibility
a pointed addition to advise guide and warn the government of the day
advice which i look forward to receiving
ell we will save that for our weekly meetings
a beat now if theres nothing else i believe we have some business to attend to
tony stares then clicks
he falls rather extravagantly on bended knee
the supplicant position of deference
your majesty the country has spoken
and i come now to ask your permiss
e interjecting no no no
its usual for me to ask the questions
wishes the ground would swallow him up
mr blair the people have elected you to be their leader
and so the duty falls on me as your sovereign to ask you to become prime minister and form a government in my name
lost for words
generally this is where you say yes
the queen extends her hand which tony kisses
she withdraws it again quite sharply then discreetly presses a buzzer by her chair indicating the ceremony is over
the equerry opens a door and cherie is invited inside
elizabeth contd how nice to see you again mrs blair
herie curtseys awkwardly reluctantly shallowly
elizabeth contd you must be very proud
and exhausted i imagine
where will you be spending the summer
oull be in balmoral i expect
yes i can hardly wait
the queen indicates a portrait of queen victoria
my great great grandmother said of it in balmoral all seems to breathe freedom and peace and to make one forget the world and its sad turmoils
t that moment the doors open and janvrin enters and whispers urgently in the queens ear
the queens face changes as she listens
elizabeth contd really
her expression changes
she frostily turns to the blairs
elizabeth contd im afraid were going to have to leave it there
with that the queen shakes tonys hand
tony and cherie awkwardly back out of the royal presence leaving the queen and janvrin
not too short was it
i gave him fifteen minutes
a beat one doesnt want to be rude
tony and cherie walk down a corridor
cherie whispers under her breath
mimics queens manner thank you so much for coming
now bugger off
what was all that about
apparently shes got a new boyfriend
of princess diana walking hand in hand with a dark haired man in his late thirties
dodi al fayed is the son of egyptian millionaire mohammed al fayed a man whom the english establishment has repeatedly denied a british passport
diana and dodi kissing and canoodling on board the yacht jonikal
the princess and mr fayed were hugging and kissing in full view of the worlds press yesterday
diana and dodi on the yacht on their last holiday together
the couple then left for paris
at one point the princess told gathered reporters to watch out
her next move would really surprise them
paparazzi are assembled outside the hotel
a few spectators too
various news reporters are also broadcasting
in french the princess of wales and dodi fayed returned to paris earlier today
where they visited a local jewellery shop where unconfirmed reports suggested mr fayed had been looking at engagement rings
cctv footage the unmistakable blonde hair of the princess of wales as she enters the ritz hotel through revolving doors
german reporter continues
in german they have now been inside the hotel for more than two hours
we believe they have been dining in a suite on the fifth floor
presently a ripple of activity doormen furtively speak into walkie talkies
growing anticipation in the crowd
an american reporter turns to his camera
weve just been told the princess is about to come out of the hotel
paparazzi jostle roughly for position and raise their cameras as the doors open and a black mercedes slides into position
elsewhere in the hotel
the real diana her bodyguard dodi fayed and henri paul leave the public part of the hotel and walk down a flight of stairs
pandemonium breaks out as bodyguards emerge from the hotel
engines roar into life of the decoy black mercedes
the crowd surges
an explosion of flashlights
the squeal of rubber as the mercedes pulls off
swarms of paparazzi give chase kick starting their motorcycles speaking into cell phones to their colleagues
the real royal party meanwhile walks briskly through an underground corridor which leads to the back door of the hotel
paparazzi who were waiting at the back exit speak to their colleagues on their cell phones and are about to jump on their motorcycles to join them in the chase
henri paul princess diana her bodyguard and dodi fayed emerge from a door and climb into a waiting mercedes
henri paul turns to the paparazzi
in french we see sub titles dont bother following
you wont catch us
the engine starts with a roar
the paparazzi double take and frantically shout into their phones to their colleagues
theyve come out at the back
the mercedes pulls up at a traffic light
all around them the glare of paparazzi motorcycles and camera flashbulbs around the car
the paparazzi call out in french and italian
they thump the window
an explosion of flashing lights
the traffic light turns amber
dodi barks at the driver
the driver a short squat man in glasses we do not see his face slams his foot down
the car roars ahead then speeds down into a tunnel followed by the paparazzi motorcycles
the scottish highlands
the silhouette of a magnificent ten year old stag stands on a rock and roars into the night
rrrrrrrinnnnggg the phone rings
a silhouette fumbles for a light switch and hits the light
we immediately recognise the face
its janvrin the queens deputy private secretary
into phone robin janvrin
he listens then his expression changes
anvrin contd what
he checks the clock on the bedside table waking rapidly now
anvrin contd right
janvrin hangs up
then urgently dials a number on the telephone
janvrin contd im going to need to speak to her majesty
till pulling on clothes janvrin rushes on foot towards the big house in the distance
lights go on all over the darkened castle
anvrin and a middle aged dresser half asleep and still rearranging her uniform walk urgently up the stairs towards the second floor corridor where the queens bedroom is located
they pass a page on the way down
tell sir guy id like everyone in
as soon as possible
the page nods
a knock on the door
the door opens and the dressers voice gently calls out
he queen stirs in her bed
mr janvrin is here to see you
the queen turns on the light
the duke of edinburgh flinches in irritation scrunching his eyes as they are blinded
he queen emerges from her bedroom wearing an old fashioned dressing gown and clutching a hottie a velour covered cosimax hot water bottle to find robin janvrin waiting
good evening maam
im sorry to disturb
he clears his throat
ve just had a call from our embassy in paris
the princess of wales
prince philip appears in the doorway
whats she done now
rrrrrinng the phone rings
were in tony blairs constituency house in trimdon near durham in northern england
click tony in t shirt turns on the light
his face is creased with sleep
the figure of cherie stirs in the bed
tony listens to the voice at the other end
who are we speaking to there
shell shocked keep me posted
tony hangs up
shes been in a car accident
is it serious
apparently dodi fayed is dead
tony has switched on the tv in the bedroom
lets just re cap on whats happened
he queen is sitting with the duke of edinburgh
what was she doing in paris
ou know what shes like
the queen flicks channels peering over her glasses trying to catch the latest news on the television
at that moment charles enters the room
his face ravaged with concern
its the first time the queen has seen him since news of the crisis
its quite awful
wants to console charles but finds it easier to say
what are you going to do about the boys
an awkward moment
let them sleep until we know more
yes thats sensible
i should go to paris
i told my people to start organising a jet
a private one
isnt that precisely the sort of extravagance they attack us for
ell how else am i going to get to paris at this time of night
the airport at aberdeen will be closed
presently a voice from behind
you can use the royal flight
they keep one of the planes on permanent stand by
deadpans in case i kick the bucket
out of the question
its not a matter of state
what are you talking about
diana is no longer an hrh nor a member of the royal family
this is a private matter
shes mother to your grandchildren
the queen mother sits on the sofa next to prince philip
thats the latest
i dont know
i cant hear
indicates television everyones shouting
charles stares in disbelief
exits the room
television plays in the corner
behind me is the tunnel of the pont de lalma which you reach by the expressway along the seine
it was along here that the mercedes carrying the princess
anvrins secretary hands over the phone
the ambassador in paris
good evening sir
janvrin listens to what the person is saying at the other end
his expression changes
ashen faced i see
an ashen faced janvrin walks along the corridor reaches the room where the royal family is watching television
e clears his throat knocks on the door
ive just spoken to our ambassador in paris maam
ll heads turn to face him
janvrin contd im afraid its not good news
prince charless face he lets out a strangled cry as he hears the news
charles roars in pain and disbelief
his knuckles whiten
no no no no
in the doorway stephen lamport who has delivered the news can hardly bear to watch
on tv struggling in vain to hold onto his composure a british newsreader relays the news visibly in shock
we have just had confirmation that diana princess of wales
voice cracks has died in paris
elizabeth prince philip and the queen mother all stare
a tableau of shock
cnn anchor breaks the news to a worldwide audience
im afraid we have some bad news to report
the cnn anchor continues on tv
diana princess of wales is dead
tony blair is watching on tv sitting downstairs having thrown on some clothes
he speaks on the phone
what have i got on this week
alastair campbell press secretary to tony blair is dressed and already in downing street
also watching television
we youre writing your maiden conference speech as prime minister
well lets cancel everything else
this is going to be massive
a beat id better make a statement in the morning
youll be pleased to know ive already started coming up with ideas
n campbells knee a pad of paper
we pick out the words peoples princess
t god shes only been dead an hour
would you prefer i didnt do my job
he queens face in close up
her eyes flicker as she watches something intently
e reverse angle to see a half open door
the sound of male voices
its the moment the boys are being told
we make out the silhouettes hugging
the sound of tears
charles repeatedly kissing his sons
ur camera stays on the queens face
a distant flicker of pain at the unrestrained intimacy and affection between them
presently the door opens and a red eyed prince charles emerges
theyre going to go back to sleep
clears his throat speaks with difficulty well try anyway
the queen goes up to charles and stiffly poignantly tries to touch him
she withdraws her hand
reading the message my private secretarys office has found a travel agency open in new york that will sell me a flight to paris with an hours stop over in
charles contains himself with difficulty
perhaps now you might consider whether its still an extravagance to bring back the mother of the future king of england in one of our planes
after a long pause all right
harless eyes burn
he turns and walks out
the queen is left alone
she stares for a moment then leaves passing a footman
to footman i dont want the boys to see the news and get upset
first thing tomorrow morning i want the radio taken out of their bedroom and the television taken out of the nursery
the footman bows
the queen sits in bed writing her diary in a bedchamber where the decor is unchanged in a hundred years
utside the sound of bird song
the first rays of light
the duke of edinburgh sticks his head around the corner
he looks at the queen
well well well
are you all right
prince philip contd your sister called about an hour ago
hope you told her to come back
cut the holiday short
elizabeth raises her eyebrow
ant imagine she was pleased
thats putting it mildly
what did she say
philip smiles to himself recalling margarets words
something about diana managing to be even more annoying dead than alive
the queen looks up
just make sure the boys never hear you talk like that
philip produces a bottle of pills from his dressing gown pocket and shakes them
prince philip contd something to help you go down
im going to do my diary a little longer
ill sleep next door
philip touches her on the shoulder
but she doesnt reciprocate
the queen appears to continue writing but our camera slowly turns to reveal her pen is not moving
shes staring in thought
victorian red brick house
in the driveway the incongruous mix of a grey renault espace people carrier and two police vehicles
in the modest garden two armed police officers are playing football with three young children
inside the plain unfashionably decorated house
the tv plays in the corner of the kitchen
cherie blair visibly upset watches tv while cooking breakfast
tony is not wearing his newcastle shirt
tony is reading out his statement which is written on a pad of paper filled with crossings out
thats how she will remain
in our minds our hearts forever
looks up ok got it
alastair campbell is in downing street sits in an office feet on a desk staring at the tv
where will you do it
i thought at church
on the way in
on tv breaking news dianas brother earl spencer makes a statement from the gates outside his house in south africa
this is not a time for recriminations however i would say that i always believed that the press would kill her in the end
spencer contd but even i could not imagine that they would take such a direct hand in her death as seems to be the case
it would appear that every proprietor and editor of every publication that has paid for intrusive and exploitative photographs of her has blood on his hands today
not the press mate
youve got the wrong villain
an aide appears in the doorway catches tonys eye and indicates her watch
ive got to go
you about to speak to the queen
alastair shoots a mischievous look
ask her if she greased the brakes
tony hangs up crosses to the study making sure the doors are shut so he wont be disturbed
we notice his shirt has no
on the back under the name blair
he queen prince philip and the queen mother sit in silence at the table eating breakfast stoically listening to radio coverage soberly flicking through newspapers
the queen is the only one who is fully dressed the others in bathrobes and she wears black
she is reading the sunday times
all around them the queens elderly maids perform the choreography of service as the radio coverage continues
one maid pours tea
another brings fresh toast
also present is the rather smarter valet and maid belonging to the prince of wales and his separate household
they have a separate and more stylish uniform of their own
hey set charless place and his breakfast nuts grains healthy food
a flamboyant napkin is folded into an elaborate fleur du lis traditional symbol of the prince of wales
the queen turns to charless valet
a knock on the door janvrin enters and bows in respect to the queen
im sorry to disturb maam but ive the prime minister for you
from his constituency
privately rolls eyes without looking up from newspaper lucky you
thank you robin
ill take it next door
he queen gets to her feet and walks out into
the first floor corridor
staff flatten themselves against the wall averting their eyes as
the queen unexpectedly comes out of the dining room walks along the corridor and disappears into
the queens study
high ceilings portraits stags antlers on the wall
the queen picks up the phone
elizabeth contd good morning prime minister
the contrast in surroundings could hardly be greater
tony sitting in a cramped room surrounded by toys in track suit in a working class house
good morning your majesty
may i say right away how very sorry i am and that the thoughts and prayers of my family are with you at this terrible time and with the two
princes in particular
herie appears in the doorway
is it your intention to make some kind of appearance
the queens face bristling at the suggestion
we intercut no member of the royal family will speak publicly about this
it is a private matter and we would all appreciate it if it could be respected as such
tony straightens taken aback
i dont suppose anyone has had time to think about the funeral yet
weve spoken to the spencer family and its their wish
a beat their express wish that it should be a private funeral
with a memorial service to follow in a month or so
tony shoots a look at cherie
given that diana was no longer a member of the royal family we have no choice but to respect their wishes
tony shoots a look at cherie
you dont feel that in view of her high profile and popularity
choosing his words carefully it might be an idea to pay tribute to her life and achievements
a beat or even just to her as a mother
the queens face freezes over
as i said
thats the spencers wish
tony contd and the public maam
the british people
you dont think a private funeral would be denying them a chance
hance to what
to share in the grief
the queens face did she hear right
its a family funeral mr
not a fairground attraction
a beat i think the princess has already paid a high enough price for exposure to the press dont you
prince philip enters dressed and ready for church
he indicates his watch
elizabeth contd now if there is nothing else i must get on
the children have to be looked after
click the queen hangs up
tony stares at the receiver
tony contd good bye your majesty
he puts down the phone
her instinct is to do nothing
and give her a private funeral
are you surprised
she hated her guts
well i think its a mistake
tonys face becomes dark
they screwed up her life
lets hope they dont screw up her death
veryone is getting ready to go to church
the queen and queen mother are putting on their hats
prince philip in full highland regalia and black tie helps both ladies into their long coats
the chaplain called
wanted to know whether he should make any changes to the service or make special mention of diana
what did you say
i told him he shouldnt change a thing
i think the less fuss one makes or draws attention to it the better
she lowers her voice as the princes approach from the saloon with charles for the boys
and we should probably arrange some company for them
some young people
ill take them for a long walk this afternoon
up craggy head
theyd like that
rince philip opens the doors
elizabeth contd but no guns
they walk off to the waiting cars
offices busy for sunday
bustling aides and secretaries
the engine room of government
an aide sticks his head round a door and calls down the corridor to
campbell turns and excuses himself from his conversation walks back down the corridor
alastair enters a press monitoring room where several televisions are playing
one or two aides are busy working
on tv tony wearing a dark suit and tie takes his position in front of the statue of the virgin mary in front of the cameras
tony steps closer to the microphones then
e are today a nation in a state of shock in mourning in grief that is so deeply painful to us
people everywhere not just here in britain kept faith with princess diana
janvrin watches the broadcast on television surrounded by several members of staff maids cooks valets footmen all craning their necks watching the television in the private secretarys room
our camera stays on janvrins face as tonys speech continues
they liked her they loved her they regarded her as one of the people
she was the peoples princess and that is how she will stay how she will remain in our hearts and memories forever
anvrins eyes roll privately
a bit over the top dont you think
janvrin turns fully expecting everyone to agree
but instead all the staff members behind him have tears rolling down their cheeks
charless motorcade pulls up outside the hospital in paris
prince charles gets out
shooting through the half open door we watch as the prince of wales disappears into the room
in the far corner an open coffin
harles is visibly distressed
we hear the priests voice as he begins to pray
notre pere qui es aux cieux que ton nom soit sanctifie que ton regne vienne que ta volonte soit faite ur la terre comme au ciel
in the corridor hospital officials quietly close the door in respect
president bill clinton fighting emotion speaking from the white house lawn
ill always be glad i knew the princess and hope everyone will support her two fine sons and help them have the life and the future she would want
president nelson mandela speaking from cape town
i had the honour of hosting her a few months ago when she visited our country and i was tremendously impressed by her
the sound of a newsreaders voice
in cities all around the world shrines have been created in a spontaneous worldwide outpouring of grief
mages of new yorkers laying flowers outside the british embassy australians doing the same in sydney pakistanis in karachi
tony blair is in a car on his way back down to london
the phone rings
he is travelling with an aide who answers the phone listens then hands it to tony
tony shoots a look who
the aide covers the phone
the lord chamberlain
in charge of the funeral
youre meeting him at the airport
takes the phone
a rather formidable handsome aristocratic man with a military bearing is driven in a car speaking into a mobile phone
brisk military prime minister
im responsible for organising all royal ceremonial events
a beat and theres simply no precedent for the funeral of an ex hrh
tony privately rolls his eyes at the ridiculous upper class pronunciation
then perhaps we should plan for any contingency
ive arranged a meeting tomorrow morning at
at buckingham palace
officials from all three palaces representatives from the spencer family the emergency services
a beat would you send some of your people
they hang up
tony rolls his eyes
where do they find these people
prince charles comes down the steps of his plane
he walks towards the line of officials among them tony blair who stands next to lord airlie
tony and prince charles shake hands
im so sorry sir
and if theres anything i or my government can do
charles appears distracted
they stood up as we drove past
removed their hats
this was paris
one of the busiest cities in the world
and you could hear a pin drop
i imagine it will be the same here
i imagine it will
harles looks at tony
the palace would still prefer to see it as a private funeral
what are your feelings on that
a diplomatic smile i think that would present us with difficulties
so do i
corrects himself the queen comes from a generation not best equipped to
tailing off she grew up in the war
a beat i think what we need what the country needs is to be led by someone
if you follow
a beat balmoral is
he gestures another world i think i understand
charles and tony shake hands then the prince moves on
meanwhile in the background dianas coffin is taken from the aeroplane by pall bearers and loaded into a hearse
he coffin is draped in the royal standard
the queen prince philip and the queen mother watch television
its the evening news
on tv prince charles is greeted by president chirac on the steps of the hospital
have we heard from the spencers again
have they made up their minds when the funeral will be
no one tells me anything
the prince of wales spent half an hour at the hospital
the party left with dianas coffin
n our walk today one of the ghillies said hed seen a large stag up at craghie head
a beat he reckoned fourteen points
we havent had one that big on this estate in years
on tv charless plane arrives back in england
dianas coffin arrived back in london at raf northolt two hours later
the queen watches intently as charles is greeted on the runway by tony blair and the two men talk
a flicker of suspicion on the queens face
nyway i thought it might be a good distraction
for the boys
the queen looks up
elizabeth contd isnt it a bit soon
i think anything that gets them outside is a good idea
arlier today the prime minister made a statement from his constituency
on tv tony making his speech outside the church in trimdon
we close on the queens face as she hears
they liked her
they loved her
they regarded her as one of the people
she was the peoples princess and that is how she will remain in our hearts forever
the queen watches in disbelief
her knuckles whiten
im sorry i cant bear it
gets to her feet im going to bed
the queen walks out
the following morning
a bare flagpole
no flag flying
but the flowers left by mourners outside the palace gates are growing
a large ceremonial room
inside some thirty or forty officials many uniformed sit around a table
among them the chief constable of the metropolitan police the heads of the fire service and ambulance service military officers representatives from the three palaces kensington palace dianas court st
jamess palace charless court and buckingham palace the queens court representatives from the intelligence and police protection services experts in protocol and finally representatives from the spencer family and downing street among them alastair campbell
ord airlie whom we met at raf northolt checks the time
its ten oclock
he raps on a table calling the meeting to order
its ten oclock
lets make a start
thank you all for coming at such notice
i think we all agree this is an extraordinarily sensitive occasion which presents us with tremendous challenges logistically
lord airlie contd a beat constitutionally
a beat practically
a beat diplomatically
a beat procedurally
alastair privately rolls his eyes
a car pulls up
alastair campbell gets out
visibly in a bad mood
tony blair is in his office surrounded by his aides working in shirtsleeves
after eighteen years of opposition of frustration and despair i am proud privileged to stand before you as the new prime minister
labour prime minister
i want to set an ambitious course to modernise this country
to breathe new life into our institutions
to make privilege something for the many not the few
so that we become nothing less than a beacon to the world
thump the door opens alastair campbell enters clutching the days newspapers
you think the royals are nutters
you should meet their flunkeys
two and a half hours on whether she should be carried in a hearse or a gun carriage
taps head nuts anyway raves in the press
alastair dumps the papers on the desk
this lot call you the nations mourner in chief this lot say youre the only person who has correctly judged the mood of the country
even the mail
disdainfully holding the paper between finger and thumb was impressed
alastair drops the papers on tonys desk
peoples princess mate
you owe me
tony watches then jumps up opens the door
his aide calls after him covering the phone
gordon for you
tell him to hang on
tony follows alastair out calls after him
tony contd so its decided
its going to be a public funeral
has anyone told the queen yet
no doubt some flunkey will be despatched
grovelling on all fours
tony smiles imagining the prospect goes back into his office
knock a knock on the door and robin janvrin enters carrying a large file
he bows first to the queen
good morning maam
then to the queen mother
the queen looks up
what can we do for you robin
janvrin braces himself
this is not going to be easy
maam there was a meeting at the palace this morning
about the funeral arrangements yes
the lord chamberlain faxed over these plans for you to consider
janvrin puts a large file on her desk
there is now general agreement maam that a public funeral would be more appropriate
he queen perceptibly bristles
nd what form will it take
at the moment theyre suggesting
clears throat and of course these are early days
janvrin braces himself
shoots a nervous look at the queen janvrin contd basing it on tay bridge
the queen mother looks up
a stunned silence
b but thats the code name for my funeral
j ndeed maam
a beat but it would be for practical reasons only
janvrin is dying
its the only one which has been
treads delicately rehearsed
the only one that could be put together
the queen mother needs to sit down
but i supervised those plans myself
indeed and the lord chamberlain was at pains to stress the spirit of the occasion will be quite different
a beat for example in place of four hundred soldiers marching behind the coffin the suggestion is that four hundred representatives from the princesss various charities march behind the coffin
the queen mothers eyes widen
and that instead of foreign heads of state and crown heads of europe the guests would include a sprinkling of actors of stage and screen fashion designers and other
clears throat celebrities
the queen looks ashen
the queen mother is pouring herself a drink
elizabeth contd wa
was there anything else
janvrin bows and leaves
then stops remembering
one other thing
the police commissioner was keen that you consider the idea of a condolence book
a beat it would give the growing crowds something to do
make marshalling them easier
distracted yes of course
anvrin reaches the door
oh and the flowers
he queen looks up
janvrin contd the flowers that have been left outside buckingham palace
currently theyre blocking the path through the main gate and will make things difficult for the changing of the guard
then move them away
anvrin flinches slightly in anticipation
actually the lord chamberlain was wondering whether we shouldnt leave the flowers and send the guards through the north gate
the queen looks thrown
chastened quite right
rrrrinng the phone rings
tony is sitting at his desk with one aide
a knock on the door
another aide enters
tephen lamport on one
tony looks up
irritated at being disturbed
the prince of waless private secretary
covering phone he said it was urgent
tony rolls his eyes then picks up the phone
good afternoon prime minister
tephen lamport private secretary to the prince of wales sits at a desk
charles is also present listening
the prince of wales wanted me to thank you again for your kind words yesterday
not at all
he feels you and he
are modern men
of similar mind
a beat who could work well together at this difficult time
tony shoots a quizzical look
well please thank his highness and assure him that he can count on my full support
at all times
a beat was that it
tony hangs up
he turns to his aide
tony contd bizarre
why is charles doing this
creeping up to me like this
he did it at the airport when he asked me to deal with his mother
ecause he knows that if the queen continues to get it wrong over diana it wont be long before the royals become public enemy no
a beat terrified of being shot apparently
his people have already been onto us asking for extra protection
he probably thinks if hes seen to be on our side the queen will be the one left in the firing line not him
so its ok for his mother to take the bullet not him
shakes head what a family
the queen in tatty old barbour head scarf wellington boots loads corgis and picnic hampers into the back of an old land rover
she climbs into an old muddy jeep and starts the oily smoky diesel engine
as she begins to drive out she turns a corner and passes charles who is climbing into his much smarter luxury leather upholstered jeep
where are they
up at craigghead
ill come with you
charles climbs in
the queen notices how extravagantly dressed he is
a kilt and tailored hunting jacket
charles contd want me to drive
harles shudders at the rough interior of the car the mud spattered windows the hard uncomfortable ride
i thought you were going to get a new one of these
its perfectly all right
the engine splutters as she changes gear
the car lurches forward
he queen drives hard through woods dust kicking up in the old land rovers wake
its a bone shaking ride
harles stares out of the window lost in thought
i was thinking last night what diana might have done had it been me that died in the tunnel in paris
the queen privately rolls her eyes
she would certainly have taken the boys to paris
i rather regret not doing that now
and expose them to the media
it would have been a dreadful thing to do
theyre much better off here
look whatever else you may have thought of diana she was a wonderful mother
a beat she adored those boys
and never let them forget it
a beat always warm
he queens hands tighten on the steering wheel
a beat never afraid to show her feelings
especially whenever a photographer was in sight
yes she may have encouraged all that but still
charles looks out of the window
his eyes mist over
charles contd that was always the extraordinary thing about her
her weaknesses and transgressions only seemed to make the public love her more
yet ours only make them hate us
why is that
charles looks up
charles contd why do they hate us so much
the queen mutters under her breath
not us dear
not having heard what
the queen salutes game keepers who remove their hats as the queen roars past
yesterday when we drove the coffin back into london there was a noise
i dont mind telling you i thought it was a gun
charless hands wring in anxiety
charles contd i thought someone had taken a shot at me
he queen hits the brakes and pulls up
visibly irritated by her sons weakness
she opens the door and steps out
why dont you go on without me
im going to walk back
are you sure
it looks like rain
the dogs jump out and im not in the mood for stalking anyway
charles knows better than to contradict his mother
he gets into the driving seat puts on the safety belt and drives off
the land rover disappears in a cloud of dust
the queen straightens then notices her shoe laces are undone
the dogs bark excitedly
my shoe lace is undone
you dont want me to trip and hurt myself do you
a beat you wouldnt get any proper walks then
the queen blissfully chatters away to the dogs
so much easier than people
now who knows the way home
he dogs yap excitedly immediately scamper off in the direction of the castle
you clever things
harless land rover drives up into the hills into spectacular landscape
a mile or two ahead above the tree line philip the two princes and stalkers carrying guns crawl on their bellies in pursuit of their quarry
a hundred years ahead of them the stag unaware of the danger imperiously grazes on the grass
the queen granite faced still smarting from her row with charles is in her bedroom
a nightcap martini is on her bedside table
she is writing her diary
philip emerges from the bathroom appears in the doorway
i spoke to charles this afternoon
flicker of coldness behind her eyes
who was good enough to share with me his views on motherhood
what did he say
tv plays in the corner
diana starved thin panda eyes the infamous martin bashir panorama interview
how wonderful diana was
thats changing his tune
what a natural
they see me as a threat of some kind
prince philip sees whats on television then grimaces
puckers face oh for gods sake
maybe hes got a point
maybe we are partly to blame
philip goes over to the television
i cant watch this
philip stares at the screen
every strong woman in history has had to walk down a similar path
we encouraged the match
and signed off on it
both of us
a beat you were very enthusiastic remember
she was a nice girl
and i think its this strength that causes the confusion and the fear
prince philip shakes his head
and i was sure hed give the other one up
or at least make sure his wife towed the line
a gesture isnt that what everyone does
a flicker behind the queens eyes
her knuckles momentarily whiten
unaware philip stares at the television
why is she strong
where is she getting it from
where is she going to take it
how is she going to use it
he rolls his eyes in disbelief
prince philip contd i cant bear it any more
if youre watching ill sleep in here
early start tomorrow
kisses her on the forehead see you in the morning
philip goes leaving the queen staring
still stinging from his remark about adultery
zap she angrily hits the remote
the picture goes black
tony blair and cherie at home watching television
the kids are in bed but their toys are still strewn around the sitting room
tony is tidying them up into boxes
on screen british historian david starkey is lambasting charles
tony and cherie sit on the sofa watching television eating pasta on their knees
starkey defends the queen
part of an older generation
she knows no better
cherie contd how much of all this could be the first stirrings of
i dont know
something more interesting
maybe this time people have finally seen them for what they are
a bunch of freeloading emotionally retarded
rolls eyes thats just absurd
they exist in a ludicrous cocoon of privilege and wealth
they dont pay tax
yes they do
the queen alone costs us what
thirty forty million a year
tony reaches the door and turns
ot you too
if you want to have a serious conversation about this
about the constitution
e dont have one
or about ways in which we as a government could begin to phase out hereditary privileges then fine
indicating plates if youre going take the dishes
tony comes back to take the dirty plates
but spare me the whole
off with their heads thing
because it insults your intelligence
the case for reform is simple and obvious
it is in principle wrong and absurd that people should wield power on the basis of birth not merit or election
a beat your words not mine
tony is momentarily thrown
well maybe now ive grown up
a beat its unimaginable this country being a republic
certainly in her lifetime
no would would wear it
cant help laughing at the idea no one wants it
gestures its just
tony heads for the door
its not a mother thing is it
think about it
if she were still alive wouldnt hazel be exactly the same age
whenever you talk about your mother you mention her stoicism
her sense of duty
the fact she was brought up in the way
a beat who does that sound like
im going to do the washing up
f alastair and tony walk through the labyrinthine corridors and busy offices
all right the good news is that the palace has agreed to video screens in the royal parks
and the bad news
what about them
heyre now predicting more than two million people will descend on london and there arent enough barriers to line the route
so weve gone cap in hand to the french for theirs
and theres something else i think you should see
alastair leads tony into
tony follows alastair into an office where a television plays in the corner
several young aides and interns are watching recording making notes
shirtsleeves feet on desks
can we run that piece again
youre going to love this
an intern puts in a video hits the play button
on screen several members of the public complain about the royals
tony watches for a moment then
look i know all this
ne member of the public complains about the flag
dont tell me
there isnt a flag flying at half mast above buckingham palace
tony rolls his eyes to himself
will someone save these people from themselves
ill call balmoral
tony turns away walks towards the door
because as prime minister of this country ive really got nothing better to do
tony walks out
the royal family is gathered for a bar be cue lunch
at a distance the boys are in the river being taught fishing by a ghillie
prince philip stands by a barbecue struggling to get the fire to light
the queen mother is in another corner
land rover pulls up
the queen gets out with her dogs
she notices philips struggle with the bar be cue
those fire lighters no good
carrying tupperware boxes i brought some stew just in case
i think its lamb
we could always have that cold
no well be all right
he queen throws some food to her dogs but makes several hand gestures forbidding them to eat
the dogs salivate and whimper but dutifully show their forbearance
staring at the food
the queen meanwhile starts setting places at the table with plates knives and forks
robin had a call from the prime minister
who expressed his concern
hilip turns an exasperated look
the flag above buckingham palace
he thinks it should be flying at half mast
the dogs continue to p whimper hungrily
then i hope robin told him there isnt a flag above buckingham palace
angrily jabs coals with a long sharp fork only the royal standard which flies for one reason only
prince philip contd to denote the presence of the monarch
since youre here the flag pole is bare
which is as it should be
harles clears his throat
isnt it possible
that to some people
the royal standard is just
and that the flap pole being bare sends out the wrong signal
the queen turns
a withering look
thats not the point
the point is its more than four hundred years old
it has never been lowered for anyone
your grandfather didnt get that flag at half mast when he died and if your mother were to die tomorrow she wouldnt get it either
in a situation like this
one has to be flexible
all heads turn
and stare at charles
shrugs it is just a flag
what about the union jack
blairs next suggestion
rolling eyes oh for heavens sake
the next thing hell be suggesting you change your name to hilda and mine to hector
angry gesture who does he think hes talking to
youre the sovereign
the head of state
you dont get dictated to
a beat youve conceded the idea of a public funeral
youve opened up the parks
the queen indicates to philip to keep his voice down to avoid upsetting the boys who are still fishing
prince philip contd you wait
in forty eight hours it was all have calmed down
like those condolence books
a defiant snort when we started with one everyone predicted they would grow and grow
but weve heard nothing more about that see
charles clears his throat
apparently there are now fifteen
and people are queuing through the night
the queens expression changes
charles crosses the saloon to his study talking to his private secretary
in one sense its comforting
a beat for the first time my parents can see what its been like for me all these years being up against her popularity
a beat but theyre still making the mistake of thinking the diana they knew from living and dealing with her will eventually be the one seen by the public
but its not
the two dianas theirs and ours bear no relation to one another at all
charles looks at lamport
charles contd they just adored her
would have loved nothing more than for her to be queen
a beat someone compassionate
with a heart
gifts in tragically short supply around here
harles looks at lamport
ive been thinking is the flag flying at half mast over my house at highgrove
make sure we get a picture of that in the papers would you
if my mother wants to make a mess of this thats her business
a beat i wont let her drag me down too
the blairs are in bed working watching tv
on tv tracey ullman speaks enthusiastically in favour of young dynamic tony blair in london
tony and cherie watch
it isnt just me
people really do want change
and want you to give it to them
and do what
cut off their heads
apparently one in six people now support the idea of getting rid of the monarchy
irritated gesture thats just the papers spoiling for a fight
but still imagine this country without them
with a nice elected head of state
a beat thatd be some legacy
if the revolution were to happen on your watch
the queen sits at her desk writing her diary
her pen scratches across the paper
resently the pen stops
she stares for a moment her face a picture of sadness
the shooting party with william harry and several gillies and stalkers drives off in various jeeps
janvrin stands at the window looking out as the cars leave
thats the stalking party off
e takes a deep breath
right wed better have a look at these papers
show us theres a heart in the house of windsor says the sun
is secretary passes a copy over to janvrin
it proves the royals are not like us the mirror
time to change the old guard at buckingham palace
heart sinks god
the secretary reads from the independent
one cant help wondering whos advice they are taking for its clearly the wrong advice
the secretary puts down the independent open on a page marked
the windsors still dont understand us
janvrins face looks haunted
janvrin contd well ill try not to take that personally
tony sits on his sofa
the three speech writing aides stand sit in front of him
tony reads from the speech
people have been yearning for a change in this country
the result is a quiet revolution now taking place
led by the real modernisers
the british people
tony tails off
not you too
tails off who wrote this
one aide puts up his hand
where does it come from
where does it come from
just look at the papers
talk to people on the streets
somethings happening out there
tonys expression changes
he gets to his feet
walks out muttering under his breath
the aides look at one another
tony puts his head around his secretarys door
tony contd get me balmoral will you
a beat ill take it in my office
tony walks back into his office
his face is deadly serious
tony stands by the door
holding it open
the aides stare at one another
what about the speech
the aides file out
the queen and janvrin are working in one corner going through her red boxes
in another corner prince philip sits watching the television
a tea tray sits in front of him
he queen and janvrin are finishing off
janvrin stands never sits in her presence
and finally maam a dso medal
a corporal in kosovo
you may have read about it in the papers
pulled two civilians from a bus after a bomb blast
the queen signs the certificate of honour
prince philip calls out indicating the tea
hurry up dear
elizabeth contd is that it
just the letter of condolence to the widow of the ambassador to brazil
the queen signs
janvrin bows and leaves
the queen walks over to join prince philip for tea by the television when janvrin turns we notice his secretary stands in the doorway
maam apparently the prime minister is on the phone for you
snaps tell him to call back
the queen hesitates then
no id better take it
prince philip rolls his eyes
janvrin nods to his secretary who rushes off to transfer the call
he queen walks over to her desk again
picks up the phone
tony sits up on his sofa in his office
good afternoon your majesty
im sorry to disturb
i was just wondering
prince philip indicates she should put tony on speaker phone
the queen obliges
tonys voice comes out
whether youd seen any of todays papers
the queen looks at her desk
most of the newspapers are strewn out in front of her
weve managed to look at one or two yes
in which case my next question would be whether you felt some kind of response might be necessary
elizabeth contd no
i believe a few over eager editors are doing their best to sell newspapers
and it would be a mistake to dance to their tune
under normal circumstances i would agree but
p under his breath here we go
the bloody flag again
elizabeth indicates for philip to be quiet
my advisers have been taking the temperature among people on the streets and the information im getting is that the mood
choosing words carefully is quite delicate
under his breath of course
thats where all the ruddy cameras are
elizabeth gestures again for philip to ssssshhh
so what would you suggest prime minister
some kind of statement
i believe the moment for statements has passed
tony takes a deep breath
i would suggest flying the flag at half mast above buckingham palace
prince philip almost has an apoplexy
and coming down to london at the earliest opportunity
philip stares in disbelief
it would be a great comfort to your people and would help them with their grief
he queen exchanges a look with philip
if youre suggesting that i drop everything and come down to london before i attend to two boys that have just lost their mother
e i doubt there are many who know the british more than i do mr
blair nor who has greater faith in their wisdom and judgement
and it is my belief that they will soon reject this mood which has been stirred up by the press
in favour of a period of restrained grief and sober private mourning
a beat thats the way we do things in this country
a beat its what the rest of the world has always admired us for
well if thats your decision maam of course the government will support it
tony contd a beat lets keep in touch
could hardly be less enthusiastic lets
the queen hangs up
looks over at philip
he indicates the tea
now your teas gone cold
tony hangs up the phone
he is lost in thought
his secretary sticks her head around the door
robin janvrin on one
a beat he must have been listening in
tony picks up the phone
janvrin speaks on the telephone to tony blair
prime minister i understand how difficult her behaviour must seem to you
but try to see it from her perspective
searches for right words shes been brought up to believe its gods will that she is who she is
i think we should leave god out of it
its just not helpful
she wont have seen anything like this since the abdication
janvrin contd and i cannot emphasise enough what affect that had on her
unexpectedly becoming king as good as killed her father
all right but first we have to deal with these terrible headlines
ill see what i can do with the press
im most grateful prime minister
but i cant promise anything
its not me they want to see
tony hangs up thinks then
tony comes out of his office and walks down the corridor to where the secretaries are
ask alistair to come and see me will you
the secretary nods and picks up the phone
nd cancel whatever im doing tonight
he turns and goes back to his office
the queen drives out in her land rover
and into the countryside
the land rover shakes and judders
the queen bobs up and down
estate workers remove their hats as she drives past
the roads have become rougher and narrower
the queen drives with surprising confidence and ability
the queen reaches a fork
she drives on taking the right fork
the queen reaches the river dee then slows down
she stops and stares
ahead of her is a difficult quite perilous crossing
he queen composes herself visibly intimidated
a deep breath then
she drives into the fast moving river
the land rovers engine roars
the jeep rocks alarmingly side to side as it slowly crosses the river
one big rock after another
the queen skilfully negotiates the challenge and is beginning to enjoy the experience
but ahead is one rock she hasnt seen
crreeak the land rovers undercarriage hits the rock
the ugly sound of tearing metal
he queen instinctively brakes then sensing that was the wrong thing to do slams her foot down on the accelerator
the engine roars in protest and
an ominous mechanical sound
the queens eyes widen
knowing that sound was serious
oh you are stupid
she tries to start the car again but to no avail
no matter what she does the land rover is stuck
the queen looks into the glove box
inside is a mobile telephone
he queen punches in a number
into phone hello
could you put me through to the ghillies office
listens ello thomas
im afraid ive done something very foolish
i think ive broken the prop shaft
crossing the river
the head ghillie listens his expression changes in alarm then
are you sure maam
the front one not the rear
ive lost the four wheel drive
you forget i worked as a mechanic in the war
and are you all right
the land rover creaks as it rocks on the stone
yes perfectly thank you
im so sorry to waste your time
well come out straightaway
oh will you
you are kind
a beat ill wait by the car
the queen hangs up
puts the phone away then opens the land rovers door
the queen gingerly climbs out of the land rover and walks across the stones to the river bank getting her shoes wet
the queen sits on a stone by the stranded land rover
she sits in silence
othing but the sound of running water wind in the trees and birdsong
ah thats good
he queen closes her eyes
all around her silence except for the sounds of the great outdoors
privacy at last
the first moment of silence in what feels like months
the queen breathes deeply
its all been a bit much
o time to think
ne shock after another
ll far too dramatic
ome to think of it this is the first time shes been able to
suddenly almost imperceptibly we notice her shoulders are shaking
not dramatically but enough to suggest what is happening
the queen away from the world is crying
e only see her back
presently she reaches into her jacket pocket produces a handkerchief and dabs her eyes
gradually she composes herself
ont want to make a fuss
he gillies will be here soon
the queen takes a deep breath
resently the sound of rustling leaves and the unmistakable sense that she is being watched
the queen turns to have a look then almost drops the cup
standing in front of her no more than twenty yards is the the queen freezes hardly dare breathe
it is enormous
his antlers are bigger and more dramatic than she could have imagined
his fur is thick
his blaze across his nose is distinctive
he is vast almost the size of a horse
nd staring at her
the queen stares back
oh you are a beauty
it is unprecedented almost supernatural
no stag ever willingly comes this close to humans
he queen looks into his dark brown eyes
an unmistakable connection between them
its a magical moment
all around them the whistling of wind the sound of trees bending
then ever so faintly in the distance
the hum of approaching engines
its the gillies coming to look for the queen
elizabeth contd indicating the stag should go go
youd better go
the stag remains rooted to the spot
elizabeth contd claps hands go
the engines get closer and closer
the stag takes a last look at the queen then briefly inclines his head turns and walks off
o sooner has he disappeared into the woods than
several land rovers appear driving across the river and gillies and equerrys jump out holding tow ropes waving in greeting and calling out concerned for the queens safety
the queen takes a last look in the direction of the stag to make sure he has gone and smiles to herself
its as if he was never there
tony is putting on a fresh shirt and tie standing in front of a a mirror
ive just been told there are news crews outside waiting for you to come and speak to the people
whats that about
i told the queens private secretary id do what i could to help with the press
dont you think she deserves it
sitting up there on her acres
but allowing her to hang herself might not be in our best interests either
tony exits then stops at the door
besides i think theres something
ugly about the way everyones started to bully her
herie watches tony go
he queen is in bed watching television
n screen television footage of tony blair shaking hands with the people defending the queen helping mourners with their grief
earlier tonight the prime minister went out and pleaded with people to understand the royals behaviour
prince philip appears in the doorway
how are the boys
not so good tonight
a lot of slamming doors
a beat i think they saw the papers
the queens eyes close
on screen television footage of families sleeping in parks
kensington palace is a sea of flowers and tributes
the mall is lined with singing hugging weeping mourners of all ages and nationalities holding candles
ill take them out early again tomorrow morning
the queen stares with total lack of comprehension at the vox pops which the television interviewer is doing
where have you come from
well i just had to be here
she was such a wonderful woman
she was an angel
and a hysteric
o compassionate and caring
philip indicates the television
prince philip contd sleeping in the streets and pulling out their hair for someone they never knew
he shoots a quizzical look
and they think were mad
philip turns to the queen
prince philip contd have you seen the latest funeral guest list
i suggest you keep it that way
a chorus line of soap stars and homosexuals
prince philip contd apparently elton john is going to be singing
the queens eyes close
thatll be a first for westminster abbey
the queen stares distractedly at the television
condolence books are now being signed in our embassies in every major city in the world
a beat and in london alone the number has reached forty
fter a beat
stares at the crowds of mourners on the television this reminds me of one of those films
a few of us in a fort
hordes of zulus outside
the television coverage continues
so its vital you hold firm
stick to your guns
they will come to their senses soon
a beat they have to
philip climbs into bed beside the queen
cmon move over cabbage
the queen stares at the tv
staring at a modern britain a modern world she no longer understands
a bright full moon
the unmistakable silhouette of the stag walks slowly across the blue white orb until he reaches a river
there he stops and bellows imperiously into the night
the following morning
tony watches from his bed
the pastel coloured set of good morning tv
the hosts a man and woman in their forties sit on a sofa
the man turns to the camera
its six oclock
time for a look at the mornings newspapers
we cut to a smiling woman in her thirties who sits at a coffee table which is covered in newspapers
well if you thought yesterdays headlines for the royals couldnt get any worse think again
the queen sits in bed reading the newspapers
her expression is ashen
she stares at the headlines
from outside her window the sound of bagpipes as the piper sergeant stoically plays in a heavy scottish downpour
a distant rumble of thunder
tony blair is with alastair campbell and a team of aides are in a meeting room with the newspapers in front of them
takes another paper he sun where is our queen
where is her flag
takes another paper the express show us you care with a picture of a grumpy queen
takes another paper the mail let the flag fly at half mast and inside the queen should be here to show her respects
alastair raises his eyebrow
but the flip side is
blair more popular than churchill shock
alastair expects tony to be pleased but instead he appears concerned
did any of them pick up on our statement of support
campbell shows blair the front page of the guardian where blair defends stoical royals
is a minor headline
lastair contd statements of support dont sell papers
tonys expression changes
he thinks then
tony gets to his feet and walks out
alastair watches the queen walks out for her walk with her corgis
she has her head scarf and old raincoat on
dogs barking excitedly
she is about to set off when janvrin appears breathlessly
the prime minister for you maam
the queen looks pained at the thought
im afraid hes rather insisting
ill take it here
a beat in the kitchens
frantic kitchen staff disperse in all directions as the queen comes into the kitchen dogs barking
cooks and maids doff their caps bowing in respect then run into hiding as the telephone extension rings
the queen picks it up
ood morning prime minister
the queen gestures to her dogs
they promptly fall silent
tony sits in his chair
good morning maam
tony hesitates then chooses his words carefully
tony contd youve seen todays headlines
cooks and footmen rush in a chair for the queen and bring a cup of tea
the queen sits down
the dogs duly follow suit
yes i have
then im sure youll agree
the situation has become quite critical
tony takes a breath
knows this wont be easy
maam a poll thats to be published in tomorrows paper suggests of people believe your actions have damaged the monarchy and one in four are now in favour of abolishing
the monarchy altogether
as your prime minister i believe its my constitutional responsibility to advise the following
tony braces himself
knows the impact his words will have
the queen hangs up
she appears profoundly shaken
she turns to janvrin
is queen elizabeth up yet
he queen walks up a staircase to her mothers quarters
the queen walks along a corridor
she reaches a door
then rather touchingly calls out
he queen sits on the unmade bed as the queen mother finishes getting dressed attended by dressers
one lower the flag to half mast above buckingham palace and all other royal residences
two leave balmoral and fly down to london at the earliest opportunity
three pay respects in person at dianas coffin
and four make a statement via live television to my people and the world
the queen stares
elizabeth contd swift prosecution of these matters he felt might just might avert disaster
he queen and queen mother walk through the grounds stout resolute waterproofs rain
a glorious scottish summer
distant rumbles of thunder
bviously youre going to have to talk to the lord chamberlain about all this
and to robert fellowes
to him too
elizabeth contd it seems they both agree with him
he queen stares
theres been a change
a shift of values
the queen looks up
elizabeth contd when you no longer understand your people isnt it time to hand over to the next generation
remember the oath you took i declare that my whole life whether it be long or short shall be devoted to your service
your whole life
thats a commitment to god as well as your people
but if my actions are damaging the crown
my dear you are the greatest asset this institution has
one of the greatest it has ever had
the problem will come when you leave but thats not for you to worry about and certainly not today
he queen rolls her eyes
then drifts off into her own thoughts its just no one seems to value tradition or constancy any more
a beat its all about show
about wearing your heart on your sleeve
and youre not like that
never have been
you must show strength
re assert your authority
you sit on the most powerful throne in europe
head of an unbroken line that goes back more than a thousand years
how many of your predecessors do you imagine would have dropped everything and gone down to london because people holding candles wanted help with their grief
the queen mothers tirade continues but the queen is not listening
she knows she has a decision to make
and as for mr blair and his cheshire cat grin
the stalking party is wrapping up after a day on the moors some two dozen people stalkers members of the royal family gamekeepers etc
load up the land rovers ready to return to balmoral castle
mobile phone rings
the head ghillie appears holding the phone
mr janvrin for you sir
prince philip takes the phone
a little surprised
philip listens what
the whole thing
thunderous philip hangs up
it seems we are going back to london
philip climbs angrily into the land rover slamming the door
peoples eyes widen
the queens face in close up
charles peers round the door
then after a beat
ive just been told
youve decided to go back to london
he queens face
avoids eye contact
i just want to say i admire
strangled trying to find the right words i think its the right decision
lets hope we havent left it too late
the queen ignores him
n explosion of flashlights the motor winders and flashbulbs of the worlds media whir and pop through the gates of balmoral castle
its an eerie venal image
an unmistakable echo of dianas world and her last moments in paris
the queen charles philip and the two princes try not to show their hostility and gingerly inspect the flowers laid at the gates of balmoral
the queens face is grim set
visibly uneasy with the cameras audibly whirring all around her
charles holds his sons hand and tries to concentrate on the flowers and wreathes and tributes
rince william stares at the cameras
hostile uncomprehending looks
the beginning of a lifelong animosity
bang a passing motorbikes exhaust backfires
charles jolts in shock and flinches privately
clearly his fears have not lessened
hes expecting the bullet at any moment
in the kitchen cherie is feeding the kids supper at the kitchen table
the cheery chaos of family life
everyone talking at once
through an open door we can see tony in the sitting room working
shirt sleeves tie loosened
tony sits with his feet up doing his boxes signing papers and half watching television at the same time
on screen the queen and the royals doing their photo call
the voice of the news reader at channel four
we are just getting some pictures now from balmoral
these are rather historic shots
clearly the queen has responded to criticism that the royal family is not engaged
tony looks up
breathes a sigh of relief
to himself thank god for that
from the kitchen cheries voice
cherie contd its fish fingers
be right there
tony finishes signing the papers
turns off the tv
walks into the kitchen
we hear cheries voice as the door closes
im afraid theyre a bit burned
the piper sergeant walks around the castle perimeter playing the bag pipes
the queen is being dressed in black by her dressers
her face apparently inscrutable
but the difficulty of the situation is clear
the queen comes downstairs to the first landing where bags are being brought out of the rooms by maids and valets where are the boys
have they already left
they left for london after breakfast
hilip shakes his head
its not right you know yes but further discussion is no longer helpful either
the queen heads downstairs
i suppose it gives the ghillies time to find a new stag for the boys now theirs has been shot
the queen momentarily stiffens
havent you heard
it wandered onto one of the neighbouring estates where it was shot by one of the commercial guests
the blood has drained from her face
elizabeth contd which estate
the queen pulling an old barbour over her black dress emerges into a courtyard where the royal cars are being loaded with bags for the trip
she climbs into a landrover starts the engine
security men stare quizzically at one another then leap into life and dash to their own cars to follow they drive out of the balmoral estate
tony sits at his desk working on his speech
a knock on the door
alastair campbell enters
heres your box
theres some important policy unit stuff on top
a beat and youve seen the papers
snaps irritated im the prime minister
of course ive seen the papers
alastair indicates the newspapers laid out on the table
the times palace bends the knee to blair the sun queen caves in on palace flag
the express downing street steps in to save queen
the mirror a quiet word from tony blair and the nation in comic voice your maj
come down to london
who says so
lastair reaches the door sees tony
father of the nation
the queens land rover plus a protection vehicle pulls up in a courtyard at braemar castle
the drivers jump out
go to open the doors for her
working stalkers and ghillies stop in their tracks and double take
faces appear at windows
stable hands visitors and estate staff stop and stare
we over hear whispers bloody hell
presently the head ghillie appears in a doorway deferentially straightening his hair and clothes
he walks towards the queen
is it his lordship youve come to see
e reaches into his pockets for his cell phone
please dont disturb him
ive come on another matter
i hope you dont mind
the queen and head gillie walk towards a circular cooling room
the head gillie opens the door
a large cooling room where the shot animals are washed disembowelled and cut up
hanging in the centre of the room his innards removed blood draining onto the floor is the stag
a gamekeeper in overalls is working on the carcass when the door opens and the queen walks in
he gamekeeper straightens
stops what hes doing
there he is
the queen gasps in shock
notices the gamekeeper was about to begin the process of severing the stags head
the head gillie mistaking her reaction for admiration smiles
head gillie contd yes hes a beauty isnt he
an imperial maam
ut the queen has not heard
she indicates a nasty wound
e was wounded
we got our guest in very close had him lined up perfect and still
shrugs apologetically an investment banker maam
the queen stretches her hand out almost touches the wound
head gillie contd im afraid the stalkers had to follow him for miles to finish him off
voice cracks lets hope he didnt suffer too much
unseen by others the queens knuckles whiten
elizabeth contd please pass my congratulations to your guest
i will maam
he clears her throat then goes
removing hat god bless you
the queen goes
dignified on the outside but dying a thousand deaths underneath
the queens face
she staring out of the window dying a thousand deaths inside on her way to raf northolt in london
she is aboard the private jet belonging to the queens flight sitting opposite her is the queen mother n the table in between them are all the mornings newspapers with
their humiliating headlines
a shadow passes across her
the sound of a clearing throat
the queen looks up
its robin janvrin
she snaps out of it
she puts on her glasses
ive done a draft of your television address
anvrin puts it down
he notices all the newspapers
elizabeth contd was there anything else
janvrin opens his mouth wants to say something to comfort her
but realises it would be inappropriate
landing in fifteen minutes
the car carrying the queen and prince philip sweeps into the alastair sits at his desk
a tv plays the footage of the queens car driving through the mall
a secretary walks in
ive got a copy of the queens speech
she passes it over to alastair
shall i give tony a copy
let me have a look at it first
alastair starts reading it
the queen and philip stare out of the car
for the first time they get an idea of the actual size and scale of the jaw drops good god
the queen stares in fear and disbelief at the people lining the mall
in places the crowds are standing twenty deep
he faces are reflected in the car windows
are they hostile
are they people she understands
camera flashlights pop
alastair makes a change to the queens speech
we close on the text as he writes inserting
speaking as a grandmother
in the background on tv we see the queens car pulls up
the doors open the queen gets out
unaware her words are being edited by her government
he queen steps out into the crowds
tony and several aides are watching the televisions
on screen the queen and philip are looking at bouquets laid at the gates of the palace reading messages and inscriptions
candles are burning
there are pictures of diana and mini shrines
poems have been written
tony watches intently
behind him the door opens and alastair enters
they sent a copy of the queens speech
alistair holds it between finger and thumb
you might want to scrape the frost off it first
alastair passes it to tony
i made a couple of changes
so it sounds like it comes from a human being
alastair turns walks towards the door
oh and one bit of good news
the old boots finally agreed to pay respects at dianas coffin
tony spins round eyes flashing in anger
you know when you get it wrong you really get it wrong
a beat that woman has given her whole life in service to her people fifty years doing a job she never wanted a job she watched kill her father
shes executed it with dignity honour and as far as i can tell without a single blemish and now we line up baying for her blood why
because shes struggling to lead the world in mourning for a woman who threw everything she offered back in her face and who seemed in the last few years to
be committed twenty four seven to destroy everything she holds dear
tony storms off
the queen continues to read the hand written messages for diana we love you
rest with the angels diana
you touched us with your love
nd also some which are downright hostile
you were too good for them
they have your blood on their hands
he queen stares visibly shocked then
behind her a small girl approaches holding a bouquet of flowers
she stops in front of the queen
he little girl tries to curtsey
elizabeth contd would you like me to place them for you
theyre for you
visibly shocked for me
the queen is thrown
suddenly looks utterly lost
vulnerable almost childlike
her eyes are puffy and swollen as though she is fighting tears
rowds of mourners watch intently
the queen takes the flowers then turns and walks away visibly shaken
a television crew is rigging lights in the chinese room in buckingham palace
janvrin enters and crosses the room
cameras are being fixed to tripods
the queen sits in a corner going through her speech
your majesty theres a last minute addition from downing street
theyre suggesting adding
and as a grandmother
the queen makes a note on the text
elizabeth contd so what i say to you now as your queen and as a grandmother i say from my heart
you think you can say it
do i have a choice
the queen turns as sound recorders fix a clip mike to her dress
were ready for you your majesty
the queen gets up
just to confirm this is going out live
right and youll be at the front of the six oclock news on all the channels i see
the queen is led over to where the director has placed a chair and table in front of the cameras and lights
calling out ten seconds everyone
the queen sits at her desk
final touches from hair and make up
the mall is clearly visible
the queen holds the speech in front of her
director contd five four
we close on the queens face and
since last saturdays dreadful news we have seen throughout britain and the world an overwhelming expression of sadness at dianas death
prince philip and prince charles watch
philip clenches his jaw muscles in irritation
he queen continues
we have all been trying in our different ways to cope
the initial shock is often succeeded by a mixture of other feelings
disbelief incomprehension anger and concern for those who remain
tony and cherie blair watch from their apartment
we have all felt these emotions in these last few days
so what i say to you now as your queen and as a grandmother i say from my heart
tony flinches in sympathy as she says the line
cherie notices this then
she doesnt mean a word of this
thats not the point
what shes doing is extraordinary
points to the tv thats how you survive
cherie turns and stares
listen to you
a week ago you were the great moderniser making speeches about the peoples princess now youve gone weak at the knees
tony bristles with irritation
i dont know why im surprised
in the end all labour prime ministers go ga ga for her maj
i hope that tomorrow we can all wherever we are join in expressing our grief at dianas loss and gratitude for her all too short life
the queen draws to a close
her face is inscrutable
the director prepares his crew to wind up
elizabeth contd may those who died rest in peace and may we each and every one of us
elizabeth contd thank god for someone who made many many people happy
the queen holds her expression for the camera
calls out and were out
the queens face relaxes
as does everyone in the room
a huge collective breathing out
irector contd thank you your majesty
but the queen doesnt acknowledge him
she removes her clip mike and hands it to the director
then walks over to a waiting prince philip who protectively extends an arm
the queen and prince philip leave the room
people are left staring awkwardly at one another
over this we fade in the sound of a haunting elegiac hymn
a soloist sings libera me domine from verdis requiem in westminster abbey as guests including tom cruise ton hanks nicole kidman and steven spielberg arrive with swollen red eyes for
uciano pavarotti also attends along with sting trudi styler bill and hilary clinton elton john mohammed al tony and cherie blair take their positions at the front of the church
the first couple of great britain
dianas coffin is driven away
showered by flowers all the way to her final resting place at althorp
he entire distraught tearful nation it seems has come out onto the streets to pay their final respects
the face of tony blair stares back from a bathroom mirror
cherie is proudly tying his tie
checking his appearance
were in the family apartment above downing street
cherie puts the finishing touches to his appearance
we notice her appearance has become even more stylish
gone is her spiky hair
and the rough edges
every inch the first lady
theyve both come a long way in a short time
off to see your girlfriend
i hope she shows you some respect this time
its quite a debt of gratitude she owes you
cherie straightens his tie
mr saviour of the monarchy
doubt shell see it that way
tonys motorcade sweeps into buckingham palace
doors are opened by his protection officers
tony steps out to be greeted by the waiting janvrin
good to see you
his most winning smile tony please
janvrin allows himself a private smile
tony blair and the equerry walk along the corridor and reach the door
tony shoots his cuffs
clears his throat
the equerry knocks
tony and the equerry enter
both bow from the neck
the prime minister maam
tony walks forward and meets the queen who like janvrin barely smiles doesnt make eye contact shakes his hand and indicates a seat
do sit down
tony sits and stares at the queen
her face is inscrutable
its good to see you again
after quite a summer
the queens face
tony contd im referring to your visit to india and pakistan where your comments about ending historic disagreements went down very well
tony contd and the commonwealth heads of government meeting
i spoke to the prime minister of malawi who was saying how much he appreciated your tough stance on nigeria
i meant to tell you at the time but you were being monopolised rather
i imagine those occasions are quite difficult
twenty four heads of government each clamouring for a private audience
tony takes a deep breath then
also we havent had a chance to speak since that week
and i wanted to offer my apologies
the queen looks up
in case youd felt manhandled or managed in any way
not at all
i dont think i shall ever understand what happened this summer
the circumstances were exceptional maam
and in the end you showed great personal strength courage and humility
e oure confusing humility with humiliation
thats not true
you didnt hear what they were saying in the mall that friday
i still believe history will show it was a good week for you
and an even better one for you mr blair
but there are fifty two weeks in a year maam
and two and a half thousand in a half century
the queen looks up
thrown by his compliment
and when people come to assess your legacy no one will remember those few days
you dont feel that what respect or affection people might once have had for
she wants to say me but instead says
this institution has been diminished
not at all
i gather some of your closest advisors were less fulsome in their support
one or two
but as a leader one has
a different perspective
a beat i could never have added my voice to the chorus
youre very kind
the queen looks at tony raises an eyebrow
but lets also not forget the more pragmatic reason
that without me there to distract everyone itd suddenly become embarrassingly clear how much unchecked power the british prime minister actually has
tony looks up
if fifty years of doing my job has taught me anything it is that the people doing yours generally prefer me with all my faults to some kind of meddling
a beat just look at the french
the queen opens her handbag and takes out her reading glasses
e elizabeth contd i suppose wed better get on with the business in hand
the queen looks out of the window
notices how the sun is setting
elizabeth contd i do love this time of day
shall we walk while theres still some sunshine left
i do hope youre a walker
the clocks go back next week then itll be dark by five
tony and the queen get to their feet
elizabeth contd i always think these meetings stand a better chance of succeeding if the prime minister is a walker
footmen open the door as tony and the queen go out of the audience room and into
blair and the queen turns a corner and emerge into a corridor from the audience room
as a matter of fact its how i think best
on my feet
ive never been one for sitting around endlessly
a good walk and fresh air sorts everything out
unexpectedly she stops
and suddenly we realize shes been holding something back
one in four you said
wanted to get rid of me
t for about half an hour
but then you came down to london and all that went away
ive never been hated like that before
and that must have been difficult
they begin walking again
ever since diana people want glamour and tears
the grand performance
and im not very good at that
i prefer to keep my feelings to myself
foolishly i believed thats what people wanted from their queen
not to make a fuss nor wear ones heart on ones sleeve duty first
the queen stops
its how i was brought up
its all ive ever known one forgets
you were so young when you became queen
the queen drifts off
then pulls herself back
but i can see the world has changed
and one must modernise
well perhaps thats where i can help
with a twinkle as they set off dont get ahead of yourself prime minister i think youll find that im supposed to be advising you
the corridor outside
as the queen passes janvrin he surreptitiously looks at his watch and raises his eyebrow
the queen smiles
footmen open double doors which lead out into the gardens
the queen and the prime minister walk out
what might we expect in your first parliament
tony clears his throat then
well maam top of the list is education reform
we want to radically reduce classroom sizes
our camera slowly pulls back over the gardens until the queen and tony are two dots in the distance
time has moved on
sand has covered the footprints
the momentary hiccup that was diana already long forgotten
