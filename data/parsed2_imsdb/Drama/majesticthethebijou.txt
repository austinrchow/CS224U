href b b the bijou the majestic by michael sloane by michael sloane october
the magic is all around you
all the time
in every thing
is to see it
the insistent persistent eight to the bar beat of boogie woogie
hot exciting pulsating rhythm ramping up
in the blackness falling s l o w l y tumbling g e n t l y a picture postcard then another
and another each one dropping through frame a gentle rain
in these old postcards hollywood is a dream town where movie stars glide out of big cars to press their hands and footprints in the wet cement
another postcard in this postcard myth youd toddle down to hollywood and vine bump into bogie and bacall and join them for dinner at the brown derby
or the coconut grove
pictures of movie theaters but not the ones that you and i know today
these are palaces
graumans chinese and egyptian
the carthay circle
the paramount the million dollar
from a time when moviegoing was a complete experience not a trip to the local mall
the ushers were friendly and helpful and wore gold brocaded jackets and guided you to your seat
the popcorn was hot and fresh and buttered with real butter not weight motor oil
a wild jumble
then one last postcard drops lazily on top of the pile
its a view of hollywood at night a carpet of lights under the yawning protective smile of mt
lees most famous resident the fully lit hollywood sign
we push into pushing into the real hollywood sign closer and closer until we fly right through it then crazily loop up and behind it until were looking down at
a gigantic aerial shot
postwar autos fill the muggy midsummer evening air with the sounds of thousands of honking horns a mere precursor to the traffic yet to come
darkened outlying neighborhoods are evidence of the postwar home construction boom as scores of stucco bungalows are being built in the areas surrounding the beating heart of the town a
swath of garishly bright concrete called of course its not like the postcards say it is
this is what its like
im pete appleton and this is my town
still in the same shot we rocket down into the center of the intersection of hollywood and vine then head west along the boulevard skimming just above the traffic past
musso and franks grill and the hollywood canteen past the egyptian theater and a rumbling pacific electric red car across highland avenue past the paramount theater and across the street to born and raised here thank you very much
sometimes it seems like everyone here is from somewhere else
but everyone loves the movies so hollywood is everyones town and they come here by the busload
to them graumans chinese theater is just about the most exciting place on the planet
to me its the theater thats playing the african queen
and like the man said the film on the marquee is the african queen
still the same shot buses disgorge tourists who move into the forecourt of the theater
the men doff their hats and mop their brows
the women pull their blouses away from their chests fanning themselves with movie star maps as they marvel at the signed cement blocks
we move among them until we pick up a couple and we stay behind them as they work their way through the crowd on their way to where an ornately
attired doorman smiles and tears their tickets
newsreels just starting folks
thats me and my girlfriend
her name is sandra sinclair and this is her town too shes from cleveland
she came out here to be an actress and thats just what shes doing
the first picture i ever wrote a little potboiler called sand pirates of the sahara
okay it aint citizen kane but you gotta start somewhere
an explosion of glitz mixed with chinese myth and legend
everywhere you look its red and orange and plush carpeting and golden light
we move through the lobby still in the same shot still tracking the couple heading for the auditorium doors which are swept open by two ramrod erect ushers and we
move into as the couple pete and sandra find seats we hear the soundtrack of the film before we see the screen the unmistakable strains of a march and then still in the same shot we see the screen
as the march swells to a crescendo we hear the newsreel bringing the news of the world to you
over a newsreel shot of a packed congressional committee hearing room a title blares hollywood reds go to jail
four years ago in one of filmlands darkest hours ten men the so called hollywood ten were called to testify before the house committee of un american activities investigating the
proliferation of the dreaded red menace in hollywood
we see several shots of witnesses engaged in heated verbal battles with congressmen especially committee chairman t
johnston doyle and the majority counsel elvin clyde
refusing to answer the lawmakers questions cowering behind the fifth amendments protection against self incrimination the ten motion picture writers dared congress to come after them
well come after them they did
and after years of court wrangling its now time to pay the piper
over shots of several of the hollywood ten being led to jail in handcuffs the newsreel narration continues
and so its off to jail the charge contempt of congress
this should give you fellas something to write about now
a new round of investigations begins this fall the mandate get the reds out of hollywood
in the audience one man yells lock up the commie bastards
and a few others cheer and laugh
as the newsreel moves on to a somewhat more innocuous subject we petes a handsome fellow in his s and sandras a starlet pretty girl in her mid s
as she rummages in her purse pete watches the newsreel
pete theres time before the picture starts you want to get some popcorn
you bet honey
pete kisses sandra on the cheek then stands and sprints up the aisle to the concession stand a big unworried grin on his face
we were young we were in love and we were working in pictures
pete pulls up to the guard kiosk in his spiffy yellow convertible plymouth
the guard ray steps out to meet him
pete lights up a cigarette
we get a better sense of him now
though earnest hes jocular and a bit of a fast talker
very chipper mornin ray
whaddya know whaddya say
me and sandra caught the african queen at the chinese last night
great picture great picture
ray is nonplussed
tips his hat
regards pete suspiciously
whats with this mr
your boss hiding in there
youre clear to go in
whats that mean
ray heads back to his kiosk shaking his head
have a pleasant day
pete covering his worry well drives onto the lot
pete pulls up hops out grinds out his cigarette looks around and goes inside
pete comes down the hall a few steps stops
its awfully quiet
he pokes his head into the door marked typing pool
a sea of black underwoods all silent
the lights in the room are off and hard shafts of morning sun stream in through the windows
one typists louise is going from machine to machine pulling covers over them
she looks up startled
they uh they gave everybody the day off
while they sort things out
sort what out
are my pages done
they took em
they took em
who took em
louise whats going on
pete im not even supposed to be talking to you
she rushes past him
pete doesnt quite know what to think
good morning peter
the voice belongs to petes agent leo kubelsky a rotund man in his fifties
he wears a perfectly tailored silk suit
whats going on
from far away we watch as leo and pete come out of the writers building and join a flood of dress extras all done up in puritan pilgrim garb and
heading for the commissary
as they move through the mob and emerge on the other side its clear that pete is reeling from something hes just been told
peter their hands are tied
you see that dont you
i dont believe this
are you saying its a mistake that you didnt go to any meetings
they say you did
who the hell is this they
congress the fbi red channels it dont matter who the hell they is
they know who they are thats all that matters
deliberately now did you go to any meetings
on the spot no
i dont know
maybe i did
leo this was before pearl harbor
i was in college
it was a bunch of kids and i was just one of em
i didnt believe in what they were saying
hell i didnt even know what they were saying
so youre saying that its true
you went to a meeting of a known communist organization
leo i was trying to impress a skirt
you know me im non political
republican democrat communist theres not a dimes worth of difference between em anyway
you should watch what you say
i dont know who fingered me but im not a communist
kid that cuts no ice with them
that im accused of being a communist when i dont happen to be one
they know you were at that meeting peter
theyve been told and they know
leo youre my agent
tell them to take a flyin piss
i didnt do anything wrong
i fought in the war for crissakes
come on pete you ran the px at fort dix
i was decorated
a purple heart
you broke your arm
you were coming out of a bar
you were drunk
at least i was on our side
look they want me to testify
ill tell em anything they want to hear
jesus leo this is my career
you cant testify
leo takes a gold cigarette care from his breast pocket offers a cigarette to pete and takes one for himself
dont take this personally kid
if it were up to me id have you testify wearing your uniform and your medal wrapped in a flag with one hand on your heart and the other hand
on a bible
what can i say
i like you
leo lights petes cigarette and his own
puts a fatherly hand on his shoulder
they dont want you to testify because youre not a big enough fish for them
they just dont want you writing pictures for now
under his breath yeah well thats enough
peter i believe in you
more to the point i read your new script
ashes to ashes
thats the one ashes to ashes
i think its great
but itll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head
you cant work until youre cleared and believe me starting right now im gonna do everything i can to make that happen
so it is a blacklist
defensive dont say that
there is no such thing as a blacklist
calm now are you gonna play ball
then pissed leo goddammit
this isnt fair
leo blows out a thin stream of smoke
hand on petes shoulder kid this is the united states government were talkin about
fair aint the point
prominent on the wall is a framed sand pirates of the sahara poster
pete reaches up and takes it down
he leans it up against the desk then sits heavily in the wooden swivel chair
he swivels around to see standing by the door
hes watching petes every move
two boxes sit on the desk partially packed with petes belongings
pete lights a cigarette and opens the lower desk drawer
he pulls out a stack of scripts and sets them on the desk
he looks at the cover of the first one by peter appleton a united pictures production february pete shuffles the scripts and looks at the cover of the second one
by peter appleton he jams the scripts into one box and turns to the other box which contains somewhat more personal items
a ragged gold pillow with tassels
legal pads of notes
an old tin toy fire truck its bright red paint chipped and worn
he turns it around in his hands
footsteps approach and pete swivels toward the door
sandra appears in the doorway
shes in costume a louis xiv courtier
she bustles past the guard rushes to pete and embraces him
the guard watches their every move
what exactly did you hear
that you got let go
i wasnt alone
wasnt frankie ruskin directing the picture youre in
he was but he got sick
we got a new director today
well whatever frankies got its catching
you mean he was
let go too
sotto an appeal theyre saying im a communist sandy
but im not you know that
im gonna fight em and im gonna win but ill need your help
during this last sandra has been ever so slightly pulling away from pete
a lot of good people are being accused of things they didnt do
hell even if i was a communist this is america goddammit a person should be able to be whatever they want to be
sandra glances at the guard who is watching everything
nervously of course but i
i dont know how i
how much help i can be to you
this is the sort of thing
someone saying youre a communist
it can ruin your career
pete sees where this is going
shes edging toward the door
will you help me sandy
ill have to think about this
i have to get back
i should go
and shes out the door and gone in the blink of an eye
pete looks at the guard
so nice to be a pariah
the guard turns away
pete moves back toward the boxes
rummaging again he comes up with a bottle of jack daniels with barely one swig left
he regards the bottle for a moment looks to see if the guard is watching he isnt pops the cork puts it to his lips and drains it
he looks at it thoughtfully as we a half full bottle of jack daniels setting down on a bartop
the bottle is in front of pete who sits at the bar quietly getting stewed
the frolic room is a classic hollywood dive dimly lit and full of character and characters
its a quiet night and getting quieter as several patrons are just leaving waving goodbye to the bartender jerry early s
jerry turns to pete eyes him suspiciously from the end of the bar
pete picks up the bottle and pours another shot
good boy he got most of it in the glass
you think maybe youve had enough
bought the bottle didnt i
raises the shot to the united states of america
long my she wave
he knocks it back and jerry pours him another
trying to light a smoke thanks jerry
tell me something
you tight with j
helps pete light his cigarette the g man
pete if j
edgar hoover walked in here wearing a dress i wouldnt know him
he says im a communist
glancing around you should watch what you say
you dont know whos listening
you know im not a communist dont you jer
sure i suppose
that why youre on a bender
this is not a bender yet
this is the start of a bender
but i can see how you were confused they look a lot alike
pete drains his shotglass puts it back on the bar
he watches jerry who is not about to refill it
pete reaches for the bottle but jerry is faster
come on ill call that girlfriend of yours whats her name
laughs sandra sinclair
gimmee her number ill have her pick you up
wanna know her real name
no ones who they really are jer
everyones someone else
im peter appleton the communist whos not really a communist
i wanna close up soon
cmon lets call her
peter stands stubs out his smoke drops a few crumpled bills on the bar and grabs his hat
then ill call you a cab
ill save you the trouble
beat im a cab
did it myself
petes preoccupied with putting on his hat and getting his car keys out of his coat pocket a daunting task in his condition
sides cars right outside
ill be seein ya jer
and hes out the door
pete takes a few steps stumbles stops takes a deep breath then totters briskly towards his car
he hauls the door open and sits inside heavily
sitting slumped against the steering wheel pete looks as though he could fall asleep right there which would probably be a good idea
too drunk to drive
he looks at his watch
cant go home yet
he turns the key and hits the starter
the engine hums to life
pete sits up opens his eyes wide shakes off the haze and puts the car in gear
the plymouth lurches forward a few yards screeches to a halt and stalls
he re starts the car puts it in gear and pulls away and down the deserted boulevard
the full moon is low over the ocean
petes car is parked at the edge of the sand the water fifty yards away
the ferris wheel and the roller coaster of the amusement pier are dark and eerie silhouettes lit only by moonlight
pete is asleep in the drivers seat head tilted back his hat covering his face snoring
the waves crash against the pilings and startle pete awake
instantly he grabs his head
i had no idea how i got to santa monica but it certainly was a good idea
i dont think i couldve faced the headache i had alone in my apartment
at least i had the ocean air
pete takes a deep breath
and starts coughing
he gets out his cigarettes and lights up
he takes a puff and glances at his watch
three forty five
i had only been there for a couple of hours at most
truth be told i was still fairly drunk
he starts the car and heads for the highway
id head north until the sun came up or i ran out of gas whichever came first
pete drives along the moonlit two lane blacktop
waves crash to the shore below the roadway
pete is finally relaxed
he takes off his hat and jams it down in the back seat
he takes a deep breath with the wind in his hair a smile grows on his face and he seems at peace
he glances down at the speedometer then at the fuel gauge
pinning on empty
guess which came first
he scans the road ahead nothing
glances to his right
the lights of a small town can be seen off in the distance
pete veers the car off the highway and makes the turn that will take him toward the lights
he passes a hand painted sign that gives him hope gas mi
petes car rolls up and stops
theres a light on the sign and another in the stations window but the place is deserted
i shouldve known better than to think that a service station in the sticks would be open at this hour but it wasnt like i had a lot of choices
pete looks ahead toward the town
its few lights twinkle in the distance
what the hell
at least thered be a diner opening in a couple of hours
id get some pie and coffee and then i could worry about the gas
pete pulls out onto the road
petes car trundles along blowing past a hand painted roadside sign which reads petes headlights catch a glimpse of another sign reading lawson wash just in front of a small
wooden auto bridge
barely reducing his speed pete heads onto the bridge
his headlights pick up the glowing eyes of a hapless possum
pete swerves to avoid the animal and a wheel drops off the edge
and the plymouth careens over the side of the bridge and into the rapidly moving water below
the water is flowing very quickly and the current is intense
pete pulls himself out of the drivers seat thankfully its a convertible and swims over the windshield
his left sleeve is caught on the door handle
nearly out of breath and panicking pete shucks off the jacket and heads for the surface
pete breaks the surface and gasps for air
his fight isnt over yet as the current is pulling him rapidly downstream
he swims with all his might toward the far bank
drained pete pulls himself out of the water and staggers to his feet
gasping oh my god
i dont believe
oh my god
he stumbles along backwards a couple of steps
and his heel hits a rock
pete falls backward and his head strikes a glancing blow on another rock
he rolls down the bank unconscious and lands face down in the mud
in black we slowly become aware of a panting breathing sound the sound of a dog
a yellow labrador full frame
it takes a couple more sniffs then starts licking furiously
maggie whatcha got there
pete is still laying face down on the bank being fervently licked in the face by the dog
a no nonsense sort in his late s he wears overalls and an old railroad cap
he comes down to pete and using his walking stick pokes him in the side
mister who are ya
my dog likes you but that dont mean much she likes skunks too
sweet nstupid thats why i keep her
pete blinks up at the old man his mouth gaping open
mister you okay
you look wet
you in an accident or somethin
i dont know
he sits up and the old man gets a look at his head which is caked with mud and blood on one side
you best come with me
can ya walk
yes i think so
he stands up shakily
the old man gives pete a hand
come on well have the doc look you over
my head hurts
i shouldnt be surprises
you smell like that was quite a night before you had there
to the dog maggie
lets go now
and they head toward the road to town
booming up we see them pass a roadside sign names stanton lawson
my ancestors founded this town
actually my grandpap
but ancestors sounds better dont it
hands pete a handkerchief here
pete takes the handkerchief and wipes the mud and some of the blood off his face
you look familiar fella
whats your name
pete stops thinks for a moment
i honestly dont know
pete and stanton walk along commerce street the main drag through the center of the small town
lawson is a bit run down creeping inexorably toward decrepit
despite that theres a timeless quality to the small buildings a familiar all american feel
several of the people walking along the street take notice of pete and nod to stanton who nods back
they all know you
course they all know me
and i know all them
towns got my name dont it
they pass the window of the drug store coles pharmacy
pete looks down and sees in the window with two faded photos all decked in tattered black crepe
two boys no more than and who went off to war and didnt come back
stanton notes pete stopping to look at the stars and photos
ernie cole here just got himself elected mayor
lost both his boys in the war
kenny at anzio and willie at normandy
thinking the war
points across the street mabel over there at the diner lost her husband max
okinawa i believe
a typical small town greasy spoon with one faded star prominent in the window
on mabel lanier a sweet faced woman in her s
she stares vacantly into space her reverie broken by a customer needing a coffee refill
all told this little town gave sixty two of its finest to the war
seventeen of em at normandy alone
moren its share i should say
got us a letter from president truman
city council commissioned a war memorial
been sittin in the basement of city hall these six years
town never had the heart to put it up
place just hasnt been the same since the war
pete looks longingly toward the diner
stanton takes note
you hungry son
got any money
pete rummages in his pants pockets and comes up with three quarters
moren enough to buy some breakfast
and they head across the street
a fork comes into frame and tears into one of the slices
pete is fairly shoveling the pie into his mouth pausing only to wash it down with gulps of coffee
stands nearby watching in amazement as her pie is consumed in record time
pete notices that stanton and mabel and the other patrons for that matter are watching his feeding frenzy
he stops in his tracks and starts chewing leisurely
he smiles at mabel
mouth full pies
wryly like you could tell
to stanton whered you find him
down by the wash
we gotta put a rail on that thing before someone else gets killed
to pete three people have died there mister
youre lucky to be alive
draining the coffee cup thanks
as she pours the coffee she looks at pete
you know you look familiar
you ever been in here before
pete shakes his head
he dont remember who he is mabel
gonna take him to the doc as soon as he gets in
distractedly doc should be in for his coffee and bear claw any minute
to pete you sure you never been in here
pete looks up at mabel and smiles winningly
id remember this pie
mabel thoroughly charmed smiles back at pete
patting his hand ill just get you another piece
a stoop shouldered little man in his late s harry trumbo shambles along the street headed for mabels diner
theres a sadness about harry the world weary melancholy of a man who has little to smile about because he has little to care about
after a couple of steps hes met up by doc ben lardner a vigorous man in his s
he comes up behind harry and claps him on the back
fine day isnt it
yes yes it looks just fine
plenty to do today
vaguely oh yes plenty
theyre at the door of the diner
doc opens it for harry
lardner comes over to mabel who hands him a tall paper cup of coffee and bags him a bear claw
mornin mabel stan
got some new business for you today
lardner and pete make eye contact and the doctor notices the bump on his head
howd that happen
he dont know
and he dont know his name neither
found him down by the wash
youd better come with me son
to mabel indicating the coffee and danish on my tab
lardner stanton and pete rise and move to the door
pete turns back takes the three quarters out of his pocket and puts them on the counter smiling brightly at mabel
blushing youre welcome
seated at the opposite end of the counter
he glances up at pete
as pete smiles at mabel and turns to go
his mouth falls open his hand moves to cover it
hes just seen a ghost
as the three men pass by the diners window
wide eyed sweet jesus
moving left to right right to left through space
follow my finger
just use your eyes
doc lardner is checking petes eyes
pete sits on an examination table his shirt off his head freshly bandaged
stanton lurks in the corner maggie curled at his feet
he was passed out cold
maggie woke im
he looks familiar
to pete open your mouth
lardner has a look as stanton pulls out a pocket watch
said as much myself doc
cant place him though
to look at him youd think the cheese slid off his cracker
looks at his watch well mornings half over
thank you mr
dont mention it
whoever you are
stanton and maggie exit
lardner checks petes ears
any idea how you got here son
lardner sniffs him
been drinkin a bit have we
i dont remember
i guess so
smells like it
smacks his lips and frowns tastes like it
well youve been wet to the skin
you mustve fallen in
i guess i did
lucky you got out that waters got quite a pull and it empties straight into the ocean
lardner takes a shirt off his counter and hands it to pete
here one of mine
pete puts on the shirt
do you remember if you were driving a car
maybe you went over the bridge
no guard rail there its easy to do
its happened before
i just dont remember
and you dont know your name or who you are that right
i just cant
gently its okay son
we just need to call you something
pete stifles a laugh
what is it
well at least you remember moby dick
lardner is on the phone sipping his coffee and nibbling his bear claw
pete is standing nosing around the office diplomas photographs knick knacks
he zeros in on one photo in particular
one of lardner and a beautiful young woman
theyve been fishing and the young woman displays a much larger catch than lardner
into phone stanton found him by the wash
not hurt too bad but he took a nasty bump on the head and he cant remember who he is
we both think he looks familiar but we cant place him
hell be here
lardner hangs up and watches pete looking at the pictures
thats me and my daughter adele
my pride and joy
charms the fish right out of the lake she does
shes very pretty
well sheriffs on his way over and maybe we can get to the bottom of who you are
lardner stares at him
pete takes note turns toward him
sorry bout that but you do look familiar to me
wish i could say the same thing
the sheriffs sedan pulls up to the office and sheriff cecil eldridge gets out
as he gets a few steps from the door harry trumbo jumps out from around the side of the building and stops him
cecil theres a young man in there
startled lord love a duck harry you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctors office
listen to me
the young man in there
eldridge keeps moving to the door
interrupting stan lawson found him unconscious by the wash this morning and im here to investigate and if we find anything interesting itll be in the paper so why dont
harry jumps in front of eldridge and grabs him by the shoulders
cecil listen to me
the sheriff stops
breathless its luke
sheriff eldridge is seated across from pete
hes staring at him intently
no wallet huh
no identification at all
beat whatre you thinkin cecil
what im thinkin is we got us one atwo things here
a mystery or a damn miracle
and by god i cant tell which
to pete boy you say you have no idea who you are
you ever been in this town before to your knowledge
well this place sorta reminds me of something
its a wonderful life
the jimmy stewart picture
i remember that one
saw it over at the bijou
so you remember that huh
its a wonderful life
or the bijou
i remember the picture
but i dont remember where i saw it
the sheriff rises and crosses to the door
doc with your permission i want to bring someone in here
maybe itll jar this young mans memory
by all means
eldridge opens the door
to someone offscreen harry why dont you come on in here
harry enters the office doffs his hat revealing a full head of snow white hair
he nods to eldridge and lardner and slowly turns to face pete
he looks closer
hesitantly he takes a couple of steps towards pete who slowly rises out of his chair to meet the old mans gaze
finally theyre standing practically toe to toe
looks a bit puzzled but the old man has such a sweet face
has tears forming in his eyes
a smile turns up the corners of his mouth and quickly lights up his whole face
softly to eldridge are you saying that hes
smiling broadly shhhhhh
harry takes pete in his arms and hugs him tightly burying his face in petes shoulder and sobbing
i knew all along
i knew you were alive
pete doesnt quite know what to think
he clearly has no idea who this old man is
mouth agape in disbelief mother ogod
to pete give the man a hug boy
thats your father
pete looks at harry
its not so much that he remembers anything hes swept up in the moment
pete wraps his arms around harry and hugs him tightly glancing over at who look on goofily fighting back tears
they smile at pete who smiles back tentatively
harry pete eldridge and lardner come outside
cmon ill give you two a lift back to the bijou
thats where you live
we live in a theater
only one in town
he opens the car door for pete get in son
sotto to lardner ben whens delly due back
sotto tomorrow afternoon
seized by a thought oh my god
break it to her gently
eldridge and harry get in the car
lardner comes over to petes back seat window
get plenty of rest luke
you took a pretty big wallop there
he turns to move away then turns back
good to have you back
eldridge starts the car and they drive away
note henceforth pete will be known as luke
itll be easier to keep track of things since everyones now calling him luke anyway
harry sits next to the sheriff and luke has the back seat all to himself
he leans forward toward the front seat and taps harry on the shoulder
whats your um your name
whats my name again
albert lucas trumbo
but youve been luke since you were a baby
taking it for a spin luke
i like it
luke looks at the town as they drive down commerce street
shops are open for business townspeople are going about their lives
a few stop and watch as the sheriffs car goes by
how long have i been gone
eldridge looks at harry who stares ahead
the silence is too thick and harry has to answer
he turns around in his seat and faces luke
gently you never came back from the war
we were told you were missing and presumed dead
when did i leave
you joined up one month to the day after pearl harbor
nineteen forty two
luke sits back against the back seat and lets this sink in
nine and a half years ago
nine and a half years
comin up on the bijou gents
eldridges car rounds the corner pulls up and stops
here we are
well son youre home
luke peers across the street
his mouth gapes open
the bijou is a decaying dada esque grab bag of building styles
its as though the architect took random parts of a chinese temple a mosque a pagoda a sphinx a symphony hall and a slaughterhouse put them in a bag gave
it a good shake tossed the contents out onto a blueprint and promptly built the result
as a matter of fact if you didnt know that the place was the bijou youd probably wonder what the cryptic message was trying to convey from atop the crumbling
and now the reason for the deteriorated state of the he b j u sign becomes apparent
train tracks run right behind the building on an elevated trestle
as we watch a train roars by
its not an earthquake its a trainquake
the j teeters at a jaunty angle threatening to dislodge and tumble down to join its fallen brothers
stares at the monstrosity
his face is ashen
his heart has sunk to somewhere below his knees
harry jumps out of the car excitedly
thanks for the lift cecil
dont mention it
welcome home luke
faint smile thanks
luke opens the back door and slowly steps out
harry grabs his arm and pulls a ring of keys from his pocket
waitll you see the inside
deadpan cant wait
the interior of the theater fulfills every promise made by the exterior
moth eaten velvet flocked wallpaper hangs in shards and pieces from the walls
its sort of a cross between a gaudy cathouse and a mausoleum served up with generous helpings of dust and grime an almost unbeatable combination of questionable taste and neglect
above the center of the lobby hangs what was and is probably the only truly beautiful item in the whole theater even under a veneer of dust the fragile droplets
of cut crystal seem to pick up every available point of light and scatter it in a hundred directions
luke and harry standing below
luke is lost in a gulf somewhere between surprise and disgust
weve been closed for a while
smiling wanly ah
luke walks toward the auditorium doors and slowly cracks one open
the ocean of two hundred or so seats on the main floor seem to be for the most part intact although the occasional row seems to have loosed itself from
its moorings and heaved itself up against the row behind or in front
is really not much more than a tatty bit of yellowing muslin framed by ragged red velveteen drapery
in the tiny orchestra pit as we will see later is an old upright piano
luke walks a few steps down the aisle
he picks a seat on the aisle near the middle of the theater and sits
as he does a cat an orange tabby leaps out from under another seat jets past luke and disappears down the aisle and backstage
harry comes over and sits behind him
turning to harry exactly how long has the bijou been closed
after you left it was difficult and then lily thats your mother she took ill and died
we havent shown a picture since forty eight
deep breath well after the war with so many of the towns boys killed people around here didnt much feel like going to the movies i guess
some of em moved away los angeles sacramento san francisco
wasnt much to keep em here i expect
and now with this television thing people just arent going out as much as they used to
didnt you have any help
oh i had irene and old tim but they really couldnt help much
broke their hearts when we closed up
broke mine too
brightening but now that youre back well things will be different around here thats for sure
rises grabs lukes arm cmon ill show you where we live
the small apartment above the projection booth is quite a contrast to the rest of the theater
its neat as a pin and fairly lit as harry has just pulled back the curtains allowing the sun to flood the room
a beam of golden light falls across a table atop which are one of the photos is of the real much younger luke
its a norman rockwell scene at a train depot with an army issue olive drab duffel bag slung over his shoulder
he has one arm around harry and the other around his mother
and by the way petes resemblance to the real luke even in a nearly year old photo is pretty damn startling
the day you shipped out
that was a proud day for your mother and me
last time you saw her
last time i saw you
luke sets it down and picks up another photo that of a fine looking woman
its a formal portrait dating perhaps from the s
your mother rest her soul
to harry shes beautiful
coming over well yes that she was
she certainly made this place a home
he takes the picture from luke kisses it and gently replaces it on the table
luke goes over to the sofa and sits
brightly can i get you anything
i can put some coffee on or some
harry looks at luke who has almost instantly fallen asleep on the sofa
he goes to him gently picks his feet off the floor lifts them onto the sofa
removes his shoes sets them on the floor
being drawn up lukes chest
stands looks down warmly at his son
then suddenly hes seized by a thought
he turns and crosses to the window
theres a small picture frame in the window
harry reaches down gingerly picks it up and turns it around
its a single faded gold star
one war casualty
harry clutches it to his chest looks over at the sleeping luke and smiles
softly when i woke up this morning my son was dead
now i have my boy again
closes his eyes i have my boy again
its early morning
luke is sound asleep still in his clothes
in the distance a train sounds its horn
luke rolls over on his back still asleep snoring lightly
slowly he starts to wake up eyes still closed
somethings strange though
the train is getting closer
lukes eyes pop open
as the train rumbles by shaking everything in the room luke looks up to see three ancient cherubs staring down at him
harry an elderly woman and an elderly black man
smiling morning son
smiling good morning luke
no expression mornin
luke is speechless
it he dreaming this
they couldnt wait to see you
this is the staff of the bijou
what time is it
i thought wed get an early start
luke sits up on the sofa and tries to get a little more awake
he rubs the side of his head that is still bandaged
the elderly woman nudges harry gently
oh im sorry they know you but you dont
you need to be re introduced
luke this is mrs
luke stands and shakes mrs
shes tiny seventy if shes a day
she smiles and curtsies slightly
her eyes sparkle brightly her manner almost coquettish
head cashier and refreshments clerk
so glad to have you back my boy
to harry much more handsome than i remember him
and this fine fellow is our head usher resident fix it man and custodian
luke meet old tim
to old tim you remember luke dont you
olt tim is well old
his clothes are a tad shabby but well maintained though they hang loosely on his gangly frame
he wears an old blue knit cap which he quickly removes as he shakes lukes hand
hes a man of few words his manner is painfully shy and he never smiles
is there a young tim
well then why do they call you old tim
harry steps forward takes lukes arm
well lots to do so wed better get a move on
luke harry and mrs
terwilliger walk down the aisle toward the screen
old time lags a few steps behind
at the orchestra pit harry climbs the steps crosses the pit
the screen is a sea of repair patches
harry pats it
fraid this has seen better days
well i was meaning to get a new screen anyway
i n need me a new uniform
luke looks at old tim then at harry
to luke i promised him a new uniform when we re opened
to old tim and youll get one too
you know i hate to bring this up but screens and uniforms and paint and repairs are going to take money which im willing to bet none of us has
silence from the group
i thought so
harry brightens clambers down the steps and races up the aisle
anyone want to see the projector
are squeakily being cranked together above the din of a fan motor
a puff of smoke then bzzzzzzzzztt light
a metal door is closed over the arcs
harry dances around to the other side of the projector and adjusts the focus on the beam of light
the others look on as he gazes at the screen through the tiny window
bright and even from edge to edge
see for yourself
the carbons sputter and die
the light flickers out
harry is crestfallen turns off the motor
shes always been a bit tricky
terwilliger is dusting the concession stand with a ragged feather duster a hopeless task
old tim is on a rickety ladder replacing burned out bulbs in the chandelier
the orange tabby cat scratches itself on the leg of the ladder
old tim climbs down and catches his breath
thank you timothy
they both stop their work and glance warily at the door marked office
sotto what do you suppose theyre talking about
brightly yes he seems to be
bad for us
luke is poring over the ledger books adding up figures on an old manual adding machine
did i ever keep the books here
no your mother did then i did after she passed
well im the first one to admit that i dont know anything about bookkeeping but there are some very interesting things in here
he scans down a page
picture ball of fire
appreciatively gary cooper
and barbara stanwyck
reading eight p
showtime ninety six admissions receipts including concessions
plus one fryer and two dozen eggs
he closes the book and looks expectantly at harry
one fryer and two dozen eggs
forty two was a lean year around here
the war had just started
you were gone less than a month
and we were coming off a bit of a drought as i recall
not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket and a chickens as good as money if you ask me
at that time it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures
yeah i know but poultry
rhapsodically i know its hard to believe son but this place this little place this wasnt a theater then this was a palace
any man woman child you me it didnt matter you bought your ticket and you walked in and you
harry puts his hand on his chest and sighs
you were in a palace
it was like a dream
it was like heaven like you died and went to a palace in heaven thats what it was like
and spotless too
inspired harry stands takes luke by the arm
come with me
he drags him out of the office and into the lobby
terwilliger and old tim watch as harry leads luke through the lobby
smiling maybe you had problems and worries out there but once you came through that door they didnt matter anymore
in here you were safe
maybe it was just an escape from reality but
it was beautiful
harry leads luke into the auditorium
the car follows but mrs
terwilliger and old tim stay behind
harry trots down the aisle and looks up at the screen
exuberant charlie chaplin
keaton and lloyd
and later on clark gable and claudette colbert and jimmy stewart and james cagney and bogart and becall and judy and mickey
and fred and ginger
he turns to luke
he points to the screen
was the altar
would you remember if i told you we felt lucky to be here to have the privilege of watching them
sadly this television thing
why would you want to sit at home and watch a little box with a little screen
because its convenient
because you dont have to get dressed and put on a coat and a tie and a hat
because you can just
how can you call that entertainment all alone in your living room
where are the other people
wheres the audience
harry comes over to luke
emphatically wheres the magic
he stands behind luke and whispers in his ear
ill tell you
in a place like this the magic is all around you
all the time
in every thing
he turns luke around and looks him in the eye
is to see it
son i think you loved the bijou even more than i did
youve got to remember that
youve got to
still looking at luke harry takes a step back then slowly walks up the aisle disappearing into the lobby
luke walks down the aisle
at the edge of the orchestra pit he stands looking up at the screen
the orange tabby cat meows and luke glances toward it standing onstage by the edge of the screen
they exchange looks as we doc lardner is seated in an easy chair his feet up reading life magazine
the radio is on and patti page is singing the tennessee waltz
theres a noise offscreen and lardner looks up
in the entrance hall the front door opens
shes a strikingly beautiful woman in her late s
she takes off a felt cap and her long auburn hair cascades down
lardner rises as adele comes into the living room
they embrace warmly
howd it go
not as bad as i thought it would
i think i passed
kisses her forehead thats my girl
he hugs her again did you
no hiccups which was good
who wants an attorney who gets the hiccups when she gets nervous
serious lawyer voice your hic
honor i hic
i always told you baby
taps her head its all up here
lardner gives her an extra squeeze continues to hold onto her just a bit too long
adele detects something amiss
what is it
adele breaks away from him
extreme concern oh my god
on a kitchen table
offscreen we hear a hiccup
adeles hand reaches into frame
lardner stands over adele who is seated at the table holding the glass of water
she raises the glass to her lips
from the other side of the glass
its a particularly gymnastic way in which to drink water but adele accomplishes it with aplomb
she waits for a moment then hiccups again
i think hic
its worse hic
that always used to work
yeah well its not everyday you get hic
news like this
youre sure hes hic
other than the hic
bump on the head
lardner sits at the table and takes adeles hand
he doesnt remember anything delly
doesnt know how he got here doesnt remember his father the town the bijou anyone
im afraid not
he looked right at your picture without batting an eye
but its probably temporary
he got all the way to lawson so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head
im sure itll all come back to him
it just takes a catalyst
you mean hic
off adeles thoughtful hiccuping we luke and harry walking along make a turn onto commerce street heading for mabels
its still light out and a soft breeze skitters some leaves along the sidewalk
i take breakfast and supper at mabels every day except sunday
have for years since lily died
if it werent for mabel id probably starve to death
ernie cole a slight balding man in his s is locking the door of his pharmacy across the street when he spots harry and luke
hold on a second
ernie runs across the street and slightly winded stands before luke staring
luke shoots a glance at harry who taps ernie on the shoulder
its really him ernie
agape well ill be
he sticks his hand out and luke takes it
ernie pumps it enthusiastically
by god luke if it isnt good to see you again
uncertain uh thanks
good to see you again too uh
still at a lose well ill be
we were just gonna get some supper
would you like to join us
would i ever
the three walk toward the diner but before they get two steps they hear is that luke trumbo
they turn to see a stout woman katie rutherford s rushing toward them
she rushes right into a very surprised lukes arms and hugs him tightly
oh luke its so good to have you back
katie would you like to join us for dinner
the more the merrier
the diner is packed
in addition to ernie and katie men women and children occupy every seat and table and many more are standing even hanging out the door
at the focus of the crowd are luke and harry seated at the counter
harry is leisurely eating a chicken dinner while luke is working on a steak
a young man seated at the opposite side of the counter is speaking
hes carl leffert s
eagerly hey luke remember the time you and me we was playing with firecrackers and the one you was lighting blew up too soon and singed all the hair offa
a few people shake their heads smile and laugh
um all the hair got singed offa my head
it was pretty funny
a couple of titters are heard
even my eyebrows
but they grew back
luke leans toward harry who never looks up from his chicken
friend of yours from high school
everybody calls him cueball
sincerely oh hi cue
brightening oh heck thats all right
its just good to have you back
isnt that right bob
hey luke you remember my brother bob
you two joined up the same day
luke smiles and nods at the young man sitting next to carl
is a good looking fellow a few years older than carl
his face is pale and downcast and he wears a cap pulled down on his forehead
he looks up at luke with hollow eyes
brings his right hand up pushes the brim of his cap up
except theres no hand there its a hook
quietly hey bob
good to meet you
bob doesnt react
he glances away and for a moment his eyes meet mabels
she smiles warmly
he turns away
ernie cole pipes up
luke i know theres a question thats on everybodys mind
well now that youre back whatre your plans
all eyes on luke
he freezes having just taken a forkful of food in his mouth
harry jumps in
gonna re open the bijou thats what
a murmur goes through the crowd
stanton lawson standing behind luke taps him on the shoulder
on the spot well
were gonna try
thats a lot of work son
places been closed what three four years now
gonna be tough
if its tough that means its worth doing
someone shouts thats the spirit
another shouts hear hear
and a chorus of voices join in agreement
hey wheres spencer wyatt
uh back here mr
well come on out here sos we can see you
spencer wyatt steps around from the back of the crowd near the door
hes a tall dark haired gangly bespectacled kid no more than or
painfully shy he clutches a clarinet case to his chest
he timidly smiles and waves at luke who smiles and nods back
spence that band of yours you think theyre ready to play
to luke spencer and his pals went ahead and got together a good ol big band
weve been practicing
uh sure i guess
well how about tomorrow night eight p
in city hall square
what im proposin is a welcome home luke celebration
vociferous general agreement from the crowd which is quickly quieted by a murmur which starts at the front door
the crowd parts and grow silent revealing a woman standing in the doorway
she locks eyes with luke
her hand goes to her mouth and her eyes well up
slowly she moves around the counter the crowd moving aside for her
she stands in front of luke who has stood up to meet her
her eyes moist she looks up at him
ive seen you before
mabel clutching a napkin leans over to katie
but i dont think i remember you
adele leans up and kisses him softly
he looks at her
but ill sure try
as mabel and katie dab at their eyes we adele and luke stroll down the street side by side
she looks at him for a long moment
i just wondering where youve been all this time
yeah a little
i think you grew an inch or so
and youve lost weight
tentatively she takes his hand and holds it
from behind them we hear a shuffling sound
keeping a discreet distance everyone from the diner is following them
adele turns and addresses the crowd
to the group you can all go home now
hes not going anywhere
go on home folks
and thanks for the welcome
harry comes over
ill be home in a little while harry
dont wait up
you two have a lot of catching up to do i guess
tips his hat night delly
and the rest of the crowd disperses variously wishing the pair goodnight
luke and adele watch them disperse
they turn and start walking
then why do i feel like were still being shadowed
where can we go
i know a place
she grabs his hand and they run toward the town square
adele and luke stand by the front steps
you must not remember anything
she grabs his hand and they run to the side of the building
adele and luke stand by a basement window inches off the ground
she looks around
certain the coast is clear she pounds on the window in three special places and it pops up and open
she looks at luke
be a gentleman
you have to help me down
slowly the muslin is drawn off revealing a statue of a kneeling solider praying before a soldiers grave
we slowly pan down from the top of the statue
when we were kids my dad was mayor and you and me and a bunch of others used to come down here all the time
looking up at the statue in this city hall basement storage room lit only by a single shaft of moonlight from the window
the muslin covering lay bunched at their feet
of course there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here
looks at the door howd they get it inside
through the door
it comes apart
she moves to the memorial
squinting she examines its base
your names on here
luke comes over
albert lucas trumbo
and all the others
i knew them all
so did you
we went to school with most of them
it doesnt seem right this being down here
it ought to be where people can see it
after they commissioned it no one could ever agree on where to put it
the methodists wanted it in front of the methodist church the presbyterians wanted it in front of the presbyterian church the city council wanted it in the lobby of city
everyone finally got tired of the fighting
so they stuck it down here
he looks at her for a long moment
theres an electricity between them and they both feel it
so youre really gonna be a lawyer
suddenly defensive and why not
you dont know how many times ive heard that
a lady lawyer
are you crazy
like a woman couldnt be as good a lawyer as a man
or better in fact
have you always wanted to be a lawyer
dont remember but yes ever since i was a little girl
what did i want to be
gently oh well
i guess you
in high school you were a pretty good first baseman
and we were on the debate team together
i think you were gonna run the bijou
you were brought up there and you loved it so much
and i think you knew how much the town needed a place like that
he turns away rubs his head
i just wish i could remember some of this
he turns back to her
you dont have a boyfriend or anyone
actually i was married
for four years
well we didnt fit together
im divorced now
no its okay
see when two people belong together the other person should be the
the key that unlocks the rest of you
im not making sense am i
moving toward her no you are
i know exactly what you mean
its not that youre missing something
its that the other person gives something to you
that you had all the time
you just didnt see it until they came along
we were in love
she instantly covers her mouth but its no good
she has the hiccups again
what was that
do you have the
luke smiles and watches adele as she makes the decision to not struggle against the hiccups
she has them and thats just the way it is
were we going to get married
we were going to be hic
when you came back from hic
he looks at her
shes strikingly beautiful at this particular moment and in this particular light hiccups and all
he moves closer to her
she moves closer to him
breathless but you had to go
they kiss passionately
she reaches up and puts her arms around him
he starts kissing her neck and she suddenly realizes shes stopped hiccuping
and as she smiles and kisses him again we luke comes down the street and heads for the front door
he has a definite spring in his step as he pulls out his keys and enters
its very dark
luke is about to swing shut the heavy door when he looks down and sees shoot into the lobby stopping in the middle of the floor
it looks at luke and purrs
luke closes the door and moves to the cat
he crouches down and pets it and its back rises to meet his hand
so you live here too huh
how come harry didnt mention that
the cat moves to the auditorium door pausing to look back at luke
curiosity piqued luke follows the cat
in the dim light we see an old mop and pail some dirty film cans and a large beat up cardboard standee of the tramp with the legend chaplin short
the cat comes around a corner and disappears through a door at the end of a hallway
luke following the cat comes around the same corner and looks at slightly ajar theres a light coming from within as well as the sound of old tim softly humming
its a long way to tipperary
luke moves to the door and knocks
um old tim
sorry its late
can i come in
the humming stops and after a moment the door swings open revealing old tim a pipe in his mouth holding the cat stroking its fur
i hope you dont mind
i didnt know anyone lived here
well besides harry
old tim moves into the room and gestures for luke to follow him
the room is lit by a small table lamp next to the neat cot which is perfectly made military style
not used to visitors
old tim points to a ragged overstuffed easy chair next to the kitchen area a sink dishes and utensils a tiny icebox
luke sits in the chair and old tim sits on the cot facing him
luke glances up at a photo atop the bureau
its a much younger old tim looking quite serious and handsome in his great war doughboys uniform
the cat jumps down from old tims arms and moves to luke
he rubs against his legs purring
luke leans down to pet him
so i guess this fellow belongs to you
whats his name
i like it
pets cat hi cat
sudden change of subject we thought you was dead you know
another new thought its okay that i live here
pause then suddenly
do you think ill get me a new u u uniform
luke looks up at the old man who stammers when he speaks more than a couple of words
ill do everything i can
old tim puffs on his pipe strangely detached
t t thank you
i always wanted to wear my uniform from the great war but your daddy he always said no thats not an ushers u u uniform thats an army uniform and
the bijou shes not the army
they give me a medal but i lost it in the h h hospital
i forget things sometimes
since the w w war
its a pretty typical bachelors apartment
the sand pirates poster leans up against a chair
petes two boxes of belongings from the studio are on the coffee table the empty bottle of jack daniels on top
theres an insistent knock at the door
you in there
this is the super i have the master key and im coming in
we hear the key in the lock and the door swings open revealing the building super s
behind him is leo kubelsky
they enter the room and the super sniffs the air
you smell gas
dont smell nothin
he must not be dead in here
hey its the best way to tell
leo moves to the boxes and rummages through them
he picks up the empty bottle examines it
you think hes drunk somewhere
under his breath wouldnt blame him if he was
well his rents past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency
he lose his job or somethin
holding out his folding money whats his rent
thirty a month
leo peels off a hundred dollar bill
heres three months rent and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place
now i need a moment alone
examining the bill huh
take a hike
just pull the door shut when you leave
the super exits and leo crosses to the phone and dials o
into phone police department
i want to report a missing person
it reads office of the majority counsel mr
elvin clyde agent walter saunders and agent steven brett both s and g men to the core hustle into the office
elvin clyde is a small thin lipped reptilian man in the roy cohn mold
hes on the phone at the moment
into phone you say you know nothing about it
you say this yet you offer no proof
how am i supposed to believe you
clydes secretary knocks on the door sticks her head in
agents saunders and brett need to see you
covering the phone you do see that im busy do you not
its about appleton
clydes eyes brighten
tell them to come in
into phone ill have to call you back
i love you too mother
saunders and brett stride into the office
weve got a situation developing
interrupting will you take those goddamn hats off
they stop shuck off their hats
saunders starts over again
weve got a situation developing out on the coast
appletons just been reported missing
clyde grins darkly
this is good
this is very good
los angeles police department investigated
his cars missing
no signs of forced entry or struggle at his apartment
clyde considers this for a beat then you two are on this as of now
tell the lapd their investigation has been federalized on my order
you find me this appleton
leans back smiling i want to see what this one has to say
luke is sitting at the desk making notes and adding up some figures
he puts his pencil down and rubs his eyes then looks up at who are sitting on the floor going through piles of lobby cards and folded one sheets like
little boys fascinated with their baseball cards
he shifts his gaze to who is straightening out and dusting the tops of the two or three file cabinets in the corner of the office
as she works she hums an old song occasionally breaking into the lyrics sings the object of my affection can change my complexion from white to rosy red
luke takes a breath well
between a new screen paint plumbing for the concession stand and about a hundred other repairs around the theater
its going to cost at least nine hundred dollars to get the bijou into shape to open up
taken aback nine hundred
and you have sixty eight dollars and thirty seven cents in the bank
your only source of income are my veterans death benefit of forty dollars a month to which youre no longer entitled since im alive and these ten dollar a month
cash deposits you make
what are those
glances at old tim theyre
thats my r r rent
its all my fault
i was neglectful and this is the price of that
dont say that
well its true
wanting to open this place back up
its folly irene pure and simple
might as well just call it what it is
off everyones worried looks we its tiny with rounded corners black and white and a hopeless chaos of horizontal bars and snow
doc lardner is fiddling with a brand new console television set trying vainly to tune in a clear picture of your show of shows
he adjusts the dials fiddles with the rabbit ears steps back and is successful
sid caesar and imogene coca are involved in an elaborate pantomime sketch and lardner fairly roars with laughter
he turns to go back to his chair but the second he does so the reception goes haywire
he returns to the spot in front of the tv and the picture is perfect again
the doorbell rings
hes torn if he moves the picture will break up
the doorbell rings again and we hear adeles voice from upstairs daddy thats luke can you let him in
ill be right down
theres a knock at the door
giving in oh hell
he moves from his spot
the reception goes bad and he marches to the door
he opens it and luke is standing there wearing a slightly out of date coat and tie
evening doctor lardner
lardner freezes staring at luke
shaken from his reverie uh no
just seeing you standing there it reminded me
theres a word for it
oh you mean the suit
harry kept all my old clothes
fits okay but its a little big
adele comes down the stairs
halfway down she stops suddenly and stares at luke
adeles staring at luke lardners staring at luke and lukes getting nervous
i shouldnt have worn the suit
adele comes down the stairs
you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before
and its just
well deja vu
another awkward pause as adele and luke stare at each other
lardner breaks it
you kids off to the dance
arent you coming
no im not much of a dancer
chidingly besides daddys still trying to figure out how to get his new television set working
i had it a minute ago
he glances at the tv set
the picture is suddenly crystal clear
ooooh its back
encouraging them toward the door well you kids have fun now
adele takes lukes arm and they exit exchanging goodnights with lardner who closes the door and turns toward the living room
s l o w l y he sneaks into the room watching the tv carefully all the while
the reception is staying perfect
caesar and coca are involved in an intricate bit of business and lardner wants to laugh but hes afraid to
he stifles his urge and heads for his chair
gingerly he sits
satisfied he finally laughs out loud and puts his feet up
the picture goes completely haywire again
adele and luke walk along arm in arm
this is strange
do you feel it
weve done this before so many times
the last time was so long ago but it feels like yesterday
you know everyones so excited about the bijou re opening
interrupting its gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place delly
shocked nine hundred
yeah and needless to say none of us has that kind of money lying around
what about a loan
you could go to the bank
a loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who cant account for the last nine and a half years of his life
well theres got to be a way
suddenly have you got a cigarette
when did you start smoking
i dont smoke
you tried to once
it was pretty pitiful
adele glances curiously at luke as we launching into the opening bars of dont be that way an old benny goodman tune
spencer wyatts big ban is comprised of a dozen or so musicians about spencers age except for the drummer avery wyatt s spencers dad
though no gene krupa he pounds the skins pretty well all the while smiling proudly as his son plays clarinet and leads the band
despite the last minute decorations the square looks nice hung with multicolored paper lanterns and colored lights
dancing to the music along with several other couples
nodding toward the band theyre not bad
no theyre not
id say your investment was paying dividends
back in you heard benny goodman play for the first time so you went out and got a used clarinet
you wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him
you tried hard but it wasnt long before it was clear that benny goodman would never be looking over his shoulder
so you gave the clarinet to spencer
that was nice of me
you had a hidden agenda though
see when he was five or six little spence used to follow you around like a puppy
bothered the hell out of you
but as soon as you gave him the clarinet
he started practicing and he left me alone from then on
and he got good
they dance a bit
now did you remember that or
just filling in the blanks
and as they dance away we luke is pouring two glasses of punch while adele is being shyly admired and having her ear bent by two twin brothers alex and
charlie mckenna mid s
youre the luckiest guy in town luke
dellys bout the prettiest thing ever come outta lawson
to alex thanks charlie
yessir bout the prettiest thing we ever seen aint that right charlie
ala mae west thanks boys ya flatter me no end
the brothers laugh goofily
hey shes doin that movie star whats her name
ignoring his brother hey delly what was that test you was outta town takin
its called the state bar exam
imagine that charlie
a lady bartender
adele and luke are slow dancing to thanks for the memory
how do you tell those two apart anyway
alex and charlie
alex is the smarter one
they laugh and dance a bit more
your dancings very good
it never used to be
you were two left feet on the dance floor
like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step
guess i mustve learned
luke dances adele away a slightly nonplussed expression on her face
the band finishes the song and everyone enthusiastically applauds
spencer bows shyly blushing slightly
he nods to the band and they bow before he motions for the crowds attention
nervously thanks folks
gee can you tell we never played in front of people before
the crowd yells no
you guys sound great
well this is our first time and its really all because of luke
i mean its because of luke coming back that were here tonight but im talking about this
he holds up the clarinet and scans the crowd until he sees luke
to luke when you didnt come back i learned how to play this so i could remember you
and now that youre back well ill never forget you
to the crowd luke gave me this clarinet but he gave this night to all of us
the crowd applauds warmly
okay folks heres mayor cole
the crowd applauds as ernie cole mounts the band riser
he turns and addresses avery wyatt on drums
pretty proud of your boy avery
avery smiles broadly and beats the kick drum five or six times to register his reaction
looks like you might have to find someone else to mix paint at the store cause i think spencers got a big career ahead of him
applause again and ernie waits for it to settle
as soon as he starts speaking the crowd becomes totally silent
you know folks here in lawson we gave a lot for our country
and we never complained and we never faltered
and we never forgot
ernies voice cracks slightly with emotion
he clears his throat and continues
we never forgot
and so when one of our own came back to us i gotta tell you folks it was like a miracle
luke seein you walking down the street it was
well it was kinda like seein one of my boys alive again
i think i speak for everyone here when i say that not a day goes by when we dont keep our boys memories alive
but luke having you back among us
well it helps us keep their spirits alive too
god bless you son
the crowd applauds
adele takes lukes hand and smiles
ernie wipes his eyes and changes the subject
all right enough athat
this is a celebration so lets have us a good time but not too good a time cause i see just about every member of the city council here tonight
and we have an eight a
council meeting tomorrow morning and i expect yall to be there
all right take it away spencer
and spencer kicks the band into the next tune as we luke and adele come over to harry and mrs
terwilliger standing at the periphery
old tim stands a few feet back
why dont you two get out there and dance
oh no i
i havent danced with another man since mr
when was that
nineteen oh nine
harry touches lukes arm
son were gonna go
you two kids have a lovely time
goodnights are exchanged and the trio leaves
alex mckenna comes up to adele and taps her on the shoulder
delly can i have a dance
alex leads her to the dance floor as adele shoots luke a little help me
luke smiles back and watches the dancing crowd
after a moment a man in a white suit and bow tie roscoe fitts s comes over to luke and extends his hand
luke you probably dont remember me roscoe fitts im the grocer here in town
shakes his hand good to meet you
like ernie said were all glad to have you back
and i hear you and harry are planning on re opening the bijou
were gonna try
place needs a lot of work
i can only imagine
you know i spoke with your dad last year about maybe taking the bijou off his hands
i dont think he gave it very much thought
well he loves the place
its his home
luke im hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation
ill come to the point
i want to buy the property and im prepared to offer six thousand dollars for it
and thats just for the property mind you
if you want ill leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has and you keep those proceeds
i just want the land
taken aback thats
well thats very generous but if youve already got a store
the days of the storefront grocery are numbered
i plan on putting up a free standing supermarket
its an alien word a super market
you think it over
no reason to risk financial ruin for the sake of a crumbling old building
fitts takes lukes hand and shakes it
good to have you back luke
as luke watches fitts walk off we last dance folks
the crowd moans slightly and spencer kicks the band into moonlight serenade slow and easy
as they hold each other close and dance
adele rests her head on lukes shoulder her eyes closed
luke strokes her hair and sways her gently to the music
luke looks toward the edge of the dance floor
bob leffert is standing there staring at the band
mabel comes up behind him and taps him on the shoulder
shes asking him if he would like to dance
bob looks down at the ground self consciously shoves his hook hand in his pocket and moves away leaving mabel standing there
as luke watches and the music continues over we luke and adele dancing
walking slowly arm in arm down adeles street up her walk to her door
kissing passionately on her doorstep
adele going inside and luke walking away each unable to take their eyes off the other
luke walking the quiet streets of lawson smiling beatifically
luke turns the corner and heads for the theater door
he pulls out his keys and enters
lukes about to close the door when he looks down and sees meowing at him from the sidewalk
he holds the door open and cat shoots into the lobby disappearing into the auditorium
luke closes the door
he hears something and so do we
soft and faraway its a piano
the melody is soft lilting almost a lullaby
luke turns toward the music which is coming from the auditorium
the piano continues building slightly in volume
he moves to the auditorium doors and tentatively pushes one open
luke enters his face bathed in the soft flickering reflected light of the movie is the big parade
the old decomposing nitrate print is badly scratched and stained
a young beautiful renee adoree is bidding a tearful farewell to her lover john gilbert as he marches off to fight the great war
luke stares at the screen
the look on his face is one of bewilderment and awe
the rickety old upright is tinny sounding and slightly out of tune
but it really doesnt matter
terwilliger is playing passionately
she never takes her eyes which are full of tears off the tattered screen except to close them when she is overcome with emotion
even so she never misses a beat
fairly dance upon the keys
stiff and wrinkled as they are they manage to elicit every possible fragment of sensitivity that the old piano can muster
luke is moved by what hes witnessing
this is the magic
to the right of luke sitting in the center of a row is old tim
stroking cat old tim stares at the poignant scene unfolding on the screen pausing only to wipe his eyes and nose with a handkerchief
he doesnt notice who looks up towards the projection booth
filling the frame
were looking directly into the beam of light radiating from the projector
pushing into the light we get closer to the windows of the booth
we come out of the beam and can just barely make out the figure of harry framed in a small window next to the projector
we continue pushing in closer and closer until harrys face fills the screen
he is watching the film his eyes are wide and moist as though hes experiencing the magic thats unfolding on the screen for the very first time
the warning bell on the projector chimes three times signaling the end of the reel
harry moves away from the window
never taking his eyes off the screen harry watches as the film comes to an end and flap
out of the projector
he kills the motor and cranks the carbon arcs apart and the bright beam dies
its not the end of the movie but it is the end of the only fragment they have
harry moves to the house lights rheostat and slowly fades them up
this done he pulls a handkerchief from his back pocket and blows his nose loudly
he crosses back to the projector unlatches the full take up reel and takes it down
hes about to move away when he senses that hes not alone
he looks over the projector to see standing there
their eyes meet
someone should say something both men search for words
suddenly luke feels very out of place almost embarrassed as though hes interrupted a very private ritual
harry senses this
clutching the precious reel of film tightly to his chest he searches lukes face and smiles warmly
beautiful wasnt it
well son i wish i couldve shown you more but this is all thats left
just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago
nineteen twenty five to be exact
a tiny laugh ha
you know since youve been back thats the first time youve called me dad
father and son look at each other for a long moment searching each others eyes
harry smiles a sort of half smile at luke and still clutching the reel crosses to the rewind bench
methodically he mounts it and threads the end of the film onto an empty reel
slowly he begins to turn the crank rewinding the film
he stops and looks to where luke was standing
but hes not there
luke is leaning up against the wall just outside of the projection booth
as he closes his eyes
in bed sound asleep snoring
a hand reaches into frame and shakes him awake
dad wake up
harry opens his eyes and looks up
what time is it
smiles i thought wed get an early start
a meeting of the lawson city council is in session mayor cole presiding
of the dozen council members we also recognize avery wyatt and roscoe fitts
vera dwight the council secretary a cherubic woman in her s is reading the minutes of the last meeting
finally roscoe fitts moved and red curtis seconded that the council form a committee to investigate the adoption of a new property taxation structure
motion carried nine to two one abstention
as vera speaks the meeting room door opens and luke harry old time and mrs
terwilliger slip inside and take seats on the unoccupied benches
ernie notices luke and the trio
well the chair notes the presence this morning of luke and harry trumbo and the rest of the bijou staff
frankly the chair notes the presence of just about anyone who ever finds their way into one of these meetings
im just guessing but i bet its not a sudden interest in lawson politics that brings you all here
clears his throat i wanted to thank you all for giving me such a nice welcome and making me feel at home
actually here on business of a sort
daley thornhill s the council parliamentarian pipes up
hes waving a copy of roberts rules of order
point of order mr
mayor this comes under the heading new business and this is not the time
i think we can make an exception here daley
itll need to be moved and seconded
ernie rolls his eyes then quickly and mechanically without inflection all right motion to hear the speaker out of order
motion on the floor discussion open discussion closed all those in favor signify by saying aye
hearing no opposition the motion is carried
ernie turns to luke and smiles
go ahead son
well ill make this short and sweet
the bijou needs a lot of repairs and the truth of the matter is harry um that is dad and me mrs
terwilliger and old tim we cant possible afford them all
so id like to ask your help to
well to scrounge around a bit and see if you have anything that might help us out
what kinds of things are you talking about
oh paint brushes plaster light bulbs yardage and if you cant come up with any of that we can use some old fashioned elbow grease
fitts leans forward
you do intend to fix the place up after all
fitts with all due respect i think lawson needs the bijou a bit more than it needs a super market
and i think lawson deserves the bijou
theres not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain weve all felt
he looks at harry and smiles
but i think a good dose of magic is as good a place as any to start
the council members murmur amongst themselves then eagerly motion to encourage the citizenry of lawson to help out the bijou in any way they can
a subtle reminder short of the allocation of city funds
agreeing short of allocation of city funds
brightly motion on the floor discussion open discussion closed all those in favor signify by saying aye
hearing no opposition the motion is carried
congratulations luke you got yourself a town to help you out
as the entire city council and the bijou trio looks on luke moves to the memorial and pulls down the huge piece of muslin covering it
harry steps forward and gathers some of it in his arms
ernie and daley step forward and look up at the monument
ernie touches the names of his two sones inscribed on the base of the monument
slowly you know this really ought to be out where people can see it
luke overhears this last and as he smiles he turns to harry who brightens as he pulls a large section of the muslin taut between his outstretched arms
harrys on a ladder snipping the cords holding up the old screen which is dropping bit by bit into the arms of luke and adele who are surrounded by a
group of little kids watching the goings on in wide eyed awe
harry snips the last line and the rest of the old screen drops down on lukes head
lukes a ghost
he raises his arms and plays the bogeyman for the kids who scream in mock terror and scatter as harry and adele laugh
old tim and harry carry a dilapidated row of seats up the aisle as adele and mabel move in tearing up the rotten carpeting and sweeping up the dust and
the men are having a tough time carrying the seats and just as theyre about to drop the row someone rushes in next to harry and grabs his end
its carl leffert
a second later someone else grabs old tims end
has a good purchase on the seats with his good hand and his hook
he nods to old tim who steps away mopping his brow
luke smiles as he sees this from the front of the auditorium
harry stanton and mrs
terwilliger with the help of avery wyatt and his son spencer tear down the rotting draperies and scrape off the wallpaper covering the lobby walls
then as harry spencer and stanton sand down the walls avery and mrs
terwilliger hand them freshly mixed cans of red wall paint and brushes
immediately they all set to work painting
luke is on the roof of the theater pliers in hand and tool box nearby
hes just straightened out the j and he steps back
to admire his handiwork
for the first time in a long time the sign actually reads the bijou
but not for long
the building starts shaking
and the train passes by behind the theater
luke lunges out of the way as three letters shake lose and fall
once again the sign reads he b j u
ernie cole and avery wyatt stand solemnly at the front of a small group gazing at the base of the war memorial as it takes shape in a prominent place
in the square
harry is on a ladder attaching the final spring stretcher to a corner of the muslin
it snaps into place and voila new screen
luke adele doc lardner and sheriff eldridge standing below applaud enthusiastically
as work progresses all around her mrs
terwilliger has just finished dusting off the piano
she opens the keyboard cover and trails her hand delicately over the keys
she sits closes her eyes and begins to play chopins op
delicate flowing music
even though the piano is a bit out of tune its still beautiful
as she plays all the work slowly comes to a halt
before long all eyes are on her
after a moment she stops
terwilliger stands and blushing bows
that was beautiful
i taught you that
i can play the piano
all fluttery oh dear yes
you were an excellent student before all that clarinet nonsense
you loved chopin
you used to call it heaven music
teach me some heaven music you used to say
she sits at the piano
play with me
some of it might come back to you
reluctantly luke sits down to her left
as she begins to play a chopin waltz she encourages him to keep the time
but its clear luke has no idea what hes doing
hes just plunking bass notes
but after a moment the bass figures hes improvising start to change and before long its transformed into the eight to the bar figure of a boogie woogie beat
terwilliger stops playing annoyed
thats no way to treat mr
she stands and moves away
luke keeps playing grinning madly hes loving it
after a moment spencer wyatt runs over and takes mrs
terwilligers place improvising the top half to lukes bass line
is tapping his foot to the beat
he turns to adele and says i taught him that
off adele cracking up
luke and all the letters up again
he steps back checks his watch and like clockwork the rumbling begins and a train goes by
this time however only the j tips over at a jaunty angle
luke adele and harry wearing coveralls sit at the counter devouring hefty plates of turkey with dressing and mashed potatoes and gravy
lukes and adeles hair is practically white from plaster dust and harrys face and hands are stained with paint specks
at the other side of the counter mabel is chatting amiably with bob leffert
she smiles at him warmly then turns to refill harrys coffee cup
harry thanks her then turns back to the newspaper hes reading
prominent is the black and white photo of a little boy and a policeman holding up petes jacket with the accompanying headline hollywood writer feared dead were red agents involved
lukes standing near the sign
he yells to adele down below on the ground
she in turn yells to harry standing near a switch panel behind the candy counter
he throws the switch
and the sign lights up beautifully
then they all feel the rumble the train rolls past and although they rattle and shake no letters fall
a cheer goes up from adele harry and the small crowd of onlookers below
delighted luke takes a formal bow
the boogie woogie ends as we complete and polished standing proudly in the center of the square
its a clear balmy day and the whole town is turned out
mayor ernie cole is at the podium
he finishes his remarks then picks up the two faded gold stars representing the lost lives of his sons
he holds them up high above his head
one by one the gold stars of the towns boys are solemnly held aloft by their loved ones
luke and harry stand at the side of the square looking out at the sea of four or five dozen gold stars being held aloft
luke catches a glimpse of a man in an army uniform
its bob leffert standing with mabel looking very sharp in his dress greens
he brings his hook hand up and salutes smartly
mabel takes his good hand squeezes it as she blinks back tears
luke smiles at this scene as harry wipes his eyes and puts his arm around lukes shoulder pulls him close and kisses him on the forehead
the lawson high school marching band is set up on the steps of city hall playing the star spangled banner
they are being conducted by their director mr
luke and harry hands over their hearts watch and sing along
then luke takes a closer look at the drum major
a tall young man wearing an ornate brocaded red and white uniform with lhs emblazoned across the chest
he has an idea
the anthem ends and luke excuses himself and moves forward buttonholing mr
phillips as he comes down the steps
luke and adele are on ladders hanging letters on the marquee which reads harry comes outside and gets their attention
grandly he gestures toward the door and out strides wearing his new uniform its the lawson high school drum majors uniform modified here and there
b i j o u is proudly emblazoned across his chest in gold brocaded letters
luke and adele applaud
old time looks up at them and old tim stands at attention clutching the front door handle
terwilliger wearing a new dress her hair newly and perfectly coiffed stands at the ready at her candy counter ready to sell tickets and refreshments
harry and luke nervously pace the lobby
luke checks his watch
he shakes harrys hand and nods to old tim who swings the door open
immediately patrons come flooding into the theater
luke exchanges surprised glances with harry then walks outside
luke comes out and looks down the block
the line of patrons stretches two deep down the block and around the corner
lukes selling tickets from behind the candy counter while mrs
terwilliger sells refreshments to a line of customers
luke sells a ticket to a woman who moves away revealing luke smiles at bob who smiles back his eyes now fairly dancing with life
he plunks down his admission and luke hands him two tickets which he takes with his hook hand
mabel smiles at luke takes bobs good hand and they move away revealing a farmer and his wife s
the farmer steps up and holds out a plucked chicken by its neck
luke surprised jumps back then smiles pulls off two tickets and exchanges them for the chicken
the only light back here is the light of the movie spilling through the screen
luke is straightening up the backstage storage area when adele taps him on the shoulder
he turns and she throws her arms around his neck and kisses him
she hands him a paper to read
luke angles it so he can read it by the light of the screen
it says california state bar association has passed the state bar examination
luke thrilled grabs adele and picks her up twirling her around with joy
he sets her down and kisses her passionately
harry is frantically threading the changeover projector
the bell on the running projector dings
once signalling that the reel is coming to an end
harry looks out the window at the screen then back to the task at hand
luke comes out of the office carrying a folded movie poster
with a satisfied smile he walks through the lobby admiring how handsome the old place looks
old tim snappily attired in his uniform is sweeping a tiny pile of debris into a dustpan
terwilliger is straightening up the candy counter
all is well
luke goes to the lobbys poster case
he opens it and unfolds a brand new one sheet poster for sand pirates the same design as the one sheet we saw in petes apartment
methodically he thumbtacks the poster up and closes the case
as luke passes the auditorium doors a man comes out of the theater and crosses to the candy counter
the door stays open for a moment and luke decides to duck inside and catch a bit of the picture
the second to last reel of a black and white early s programmer
its nighttime in the desert
a huge full moon hangs over a b movie soundstage version of the pyramids
gregory a dark handsome leading man in a pith helmet is engaged in a fierce swordfight with khalid the villain
pete takes a seat on the aisle near the door
you dont think you can win this do you
khalid lunges and draws gregorys blood
ala khalid ha
id say i was winning
id say i was winning
lukes look is how did i know he was gonna say that
onscreen an evil henchman is sneaking up behind gregory
pete did it again
onscreen gregory turns and kills the henchman then quickly dispatches khalid
he stands over the body catches his breath and says its all right rebecca
is he dead
rebecca a beautiful american woman comes into view and takes our attention because shes being played by sandra sinclair pete appletons ex girlfriend
his mouth is gaping open
he stares at the screen
a whisper sandra
confused he stumbles backward moving into the lobby as the man goes back into the auditorium with his popcorn and the door closes
luke is staring at the closed auditorium doors
old tim and mrs
terwilliger take note of his odd behavior
dear are you all right
without answering luke turns and runs to the poster case
forget the cheesy b movie artwork
as luke looks at the poster its clear that hes remembering something
he looks at the picture of sandra then scans down to the credits block at the bottom of the poster
his eyes lock upon my god
suddenly all of pete appletons worries have come crashing down on him
because he remembers
the warning bell dings
twice but the changeover projectors carbon arcs keep sputtering and the motor keeps dying
pleading oh baby make your daddy happy
harrys trying to keep the projector going as the previous reel is about to end
given no other choice he finally gives the changeover projector a good swift kick
it hums to life
a perfect changeover
harry pets the projector
youre a good girl
no matter what i say
as he turns away he feels a sudden sharp pain in his left arm
wincing he grabs his arm staggers back towards a chair and sits heavily
he tries to clear his throat but it dissolves into a hacking choking cough
he tries to stand but drops to his knees clutching his left arm harder than before
in pain oh jesus
harry falls to the floor and as he does breaks in the projector gate
luke is still staring at the poster lost in thought
offscreen we hear the audience whistling and hooting in reaction to the broken film
terwilliger has been calling lukes name but he doesnt come out of his stupor until old tim comes up behind him and spins him around
luke stares wide eyed at the old man
luke somethings wrong
the film broke and i cant raise harry on the house phone
still dazed what
youve got to talk to them before they tear the theater apart
finally luke pulls himself together hears the audience noise and moves toward the auditorium doors
amid the shouting and tossing of popcorn and debris luke tries to regain his composure as he strides down the aisle toward the stage
come on folks this happens every once in a while just settle down
the crowd quiets down a bit
luke shields his eyes from the light and calls up to the projection booth
harry why dont you cut the projector and bring up the house lights
just the flickering beam of light
luke gripped by a sudden fear rushes up the aisle and into the lobby
the crowd goes silent
old tim and mrs
terwilliger watch as luke tears into the lobby and makes for the balcony stairs
and charges between the seats and up the stairs to the projection booth
luke bursts in the sees harry on the floor
he rushes over and kneels down next to him
with difficulty the film broke
i know i know
a man pops his head into the projection booth door
to the man get doc lardner
harry is in bed eyes closed
doc lardner has a stethoscope to his chest
he leans up and pats harrys hand
he stands and comes over to luke and adele who are near the door
just outside angling for a view into the room are old tim and mrs
its a pretty massive heart attack
his lungs have filled with fluid and well
it seems as though his body is just
can we get him to the hospital
even if we could and the move didnt kill him thered be very little we could do there that we cant do here
puts his hand on lukes shoulder im sorry
harrys eyelids flutter
weakly did you
luke rushes to harrys side and takes his hand
did i what
irritated did you fix the damn film
it broke in the last reel
everyone went home
we offered them refunds
anybody take it
closes his eyes vultures
im not happy about this mind you but if i have to go at least im going in my own bed the same bed my lily died in and
knowing that my son is alive
thats not too shabby is it
youre not going anywhere harry
dont tell me i know about these things
ive seen it before
its all right
oh god i love you son
luke kisses his hand and leans up whispering in harrys ear and i love you
harry smiles faintly looks at luke
he nods then closes his eyes
softly oh so
slowly harry exhales
his face relaxes completely at peace
he doesnt breathe again
luke looks at harrys face for a moment
then as the tears well up he leans over and ever so gently places a kiss on harrys forehead
its a beautiful bright sunny day
luke and adele stand at the front of the large group of mourners
reverend coleman s conducts the service
we commit to the earth the mortal remains of harry bernard trumbo safe in the knowledge that his immortal soul is at peace and at last reunited with his beloved
lillian in the bosom of the lord
let us pray
everyone bows their heads
the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures
luke looks up at the sky then steps forward and lays a single rose on harrys casket
then as everyone surreptitiously watches he turns and walks away from the gravesite toward the cemetery entrance
adele watches luke depart
and shes not alone
agents saunders and brett are watching everything from their car which is parked nearby
as luke walks away saunders snaps his photo with a long lens camera
and lukes name inscribed there
luke stands in front of the memorial head bowed
after a moment he sits leaning against the memorial
lost in thought he buries his face in his hands
mind if i join you
luke looks up squinting
adele stands above him backlit by the golden light of the sundown
she sits next to him
tentatively she touches his shoulder
he leans into her and she enfolds her arm in his
your father said
that i would start to remember things
suddenly adele feels as though shes walking on eggshells
do you remember
it started coming back a couple of days ago
i remember everything now
harry wasnt my father
and im not
im not luke
she closes her eyes
all her suspicions are suddenly confirmed
her tears start and she moves to hug luke but instead she starts hitting him flailing beating on his chest
he hugs her tightly and she completely lets go
crying oh god i knew
i knew from the start
i wanted you to be luke
i wanted you to be alive
youre so much like him you have no idea
no wonder everyone else accepted you
you dont know what you what luke meant to this town suddenly being alive
you dont know what this town lost
you just dont know
she pulls away stands and looks him in the eye
sobbing uncontrollably i knew you werent luke
and i tried not to fall in love with you
i dont even know your name
luke moves toward her
she backs away
i fell in love with you too delly
only now i dont know how i feel about you or about anything
i only think i know how luke would feel
shes still sobbing
he moves to her takes her in his arms
pulling away no
i have to
she runs off crying
making short work of a steak and eggs
as he powers down his meal agents saunders and brett distinctly out of place in their dark suits and hats enter the diner
they take note of eldridge and come over
are you the sheriff
and i got the uniform to prove it
im special agent walter saunders this is special agent steven brett fbi
may we have a word with you
they flash identification which eldridge notes
gesturing please sit
they sit across from eldridge
as saunders speaks agent brett pulls a photo from his coat pocket
a couple of days ago a county flood control maintenance crew pulled a car out of the lawson wash ocean outlet
they checked its registration and when the owner was identified they notified us
agent brett slides the photo toward eldridge
its peter appleton luke
smiling well thatd be luke trumbo
looks like you boysve solved a little mystery weve had going on for a few months
sir thats a photo of man named peter appleton
hes been missing from los angeles for close to three months now
no theres got to be a
sheriff this man is a suspected communist
oh and by the way from here on hes pete again
pete sits across from eldridge saunders and brett
the silence in the room is thick
am i under arrest
eldridge glances at agent saunders who stares at pete impassively
well no but these gentlemen would like to get some answers
i dont know what else to tell you
i wasnt hiding out
i hit my head and i didnt remember anything until a few days ago
now that you remember who you are were you planning on telling anyone your true identity
i already have
if she still is
checking his notebook would that be miss sinclair
ironic smile no
no not miss sinclair
im talking about adele lardner
agent saunders glances at eldridge
the doctors daughter
she was luke trumbos sweetheart
appleton i have reason to believe youre holding something back and that just rubs me the wrong way
pause sir are you a communist
pete comes out into the bright midday sun
it takes a moment for his eyes to adjust and when they do he becomes aware of perhaps twenty people lining the sidewalk in front of the station
we recognize several of the people
bob leffert and mabel lanier
now theres nothing in the least bit threatening about the gathering and thats whats so disturbing about it
theyre not an angry mob theyre just standing there running the gamut of emotions
its an awkward moment
pete doesnt quite know how to react
he wants to go over and talk to them but he wouldnt know what to say
he wishes one of them would talk to him just say something anything
but no one does
then bob leffert turns away from pete
he shoves his hook hand into his pocket and sullenly moves away followed by mabel then his brother then the others
leaving pete alone
old tim in his doormans uniform stands by the open empty door
terwilliger behind the candy counter wipes up an imaginary spill a full wheel of unsold tickets by her elbow
pete anxiously paces the lobby
he looks into every seat is empty
he glances at his watch then turns to old tim and mrs
terwilliger lets close up
terwilliger and old tim silently shamble off pete goes over and flips off several light switches
most of the theater goes dark
pete sits leaning up against the base of the dark sign
a gentle breeze tousles his hair as he gazes up at the stars
after a moment he hears footsteps coming up the ladder to the roof
adele climbs onto the roof comes over and sits down next to pete
im sure a lot of people down in l
are worried sick about you
im sure a lot more people down in l
want a piece of me
he turns to her
this luke was a pretty good guy wasnt he
wistful smile oh yes
yes he was
let me tell you im not luke
i know who i am now and you dont
i dont like me very much
changing the subject you know its going to take me a while to get used to calling you pete
she takes it for a spin pete
its a nice name
thanks i like it
delly i want to do the right thing
pete cant believe he just said that but he did
i believe you
the truth is im a lot of things but communist isnt one of them
but if you only went to one meeting why does anyone care
besides why should it even matter if you were a communist
come on delly look at the country today
were fighting communists in korea were paranoid about the russians weve got this thing with the rosenbergs and the atomic bomb
bitterly you think they want suspected communists entertaining the american public with party propaganda like gosh i dont know sand pirates of the sahara
forget about all that
you want to do the right thing
then defend your name
if someone says something about you thats untrue you have to stand up and say so
i know the law and the laws on your side
what about you delly
i am too
pete smiles and puts his arms around her
youll stand by me
they kiss and we theres a thick bank of coastal fog just down the road obscuring any view of the ocean a mile away
its deadly quiet as gas station owner rory late s pulls up and parks his model a truck
he gets out and an big old german shepherd lottie jumps out of the truck bed
rory moves to the door and is about to put his key in the lock when lottie starts whining looking toward the fog bank and sniffing the air expectantly
he stops he hears something too a low rumble
lottie starts barking
the rumble is getting louder
rorys getting worried
he looks at its starting to glow from within
lotties barking gets louder and angrier
suddenly a large black car punches out of the fog bank and tears down the road
its followed by another and another and perhaps a dozen more cars and trucks all heading hell bent for leather toward the town
rory moves toward lottie trying to quiet her as the cars fly past the station
i know lottie
this time i thought it was the martians for sure
the place is bedlam overflowing with reporters newsreel camera crews photographers you name it
a radio crew is broadcasting in front of mabels diner
the reporter is on the air hugging his microphone speaking above the din
mabel stands next to him his hand on her shoulder
bob leffert stands nearby grim
im here with mabel lanier the owner of the diner here on commerce street where appleton often took meals
lanier tell me what are your thoughts about having such a celebrated suspected communist in your midst all this time
well its kinds hard to believe cause luke i mean peter is such a
i mean since hes been back ive never seen the town so happy and all
its like he gave us some
i dont know
some hope i guess
what shes referring to folks is yet another bizarre twist in this story
not only is appleton alive but hes been suffering from amnesia and living here in lawson where due to a startling resemblance everyone in town for the last three months
has taken him for one of lawsons dead war heroes albert trumbo
a catch in her voice luke
we always called him luke
mabel glances at bob who lowers his head
pete is at the desk staring into space
adele leans against the radiator behind him
the silence in the room is thick
across the desk from pete sits leo kubelsky
the fbi cant arrest you because you havent done anything wrong
well thats a relief
i understand they usually dont let that stop them
youre gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the un american activities committee when they open hearings in los angeles
now if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear theyll clear you
and i wont be a communist anymore
so it doesnt make any difference that im not one now and have never been one
leo stands and walks to the window
kid dont get philosophical with me
this is a game but its not your game
you play by their rules or theyll ruin you
and they have the power to do it
doesnt it bother anyone that this is a perversion of democracy
leo turns to her and smiles
his tone is charmingly matter of factly not condescending in the least
darling dont kid yourself
we dont have a democracy in this country
the declaration of independence
these are pieces of paper with signatures on em
and you know what a piece of paper with a signature is
its a contract
and you know what a contract is
something that can be re negotiated at any time
it just so happens that the house un american activities committee is re negotiating the contract this time around
leo takes out a cigarette lights it
next time it might be the fbi
the time after that it might be the president
but itll always be someone
count on it
thats not the country luke fought for
lest we forget peter your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than lukes
its wrong leo
peter dont let that stop you all of a sudden
leo pulls a folded paper from his coat pocket and hands it to pete
when youre called read this to them
just tell the bastards what they want to hear and we can all get on with our lives
theres a knock at the door
leo opens it
standing there is a small man wearing a serious suit and an even more serious fedora
standing you found him
the man reaches into his breast pocket and withdraws a blue backed folded document which he hands to pete
as he does a flash lights the room
at the door a pair of photographers and a newsreel cameraman are jockeying for position
pete rolls his eyes
peter appleton you are hereby subpoenaed to appear as a witness before a special session of the house committee on un american activities
you are to appear in los angeles california at the biltmore hotel at the date and time specified herein
pete takes the subpoena
theres an awkward moment as the newsreel camera is still rolling
pete cradles the subpoena like an oscar statuette and smiles into the lens
on this is a great honor
ill treasure this always
in a partially packed suitcase
pete is sitting in a chair reading the statement leo gave him
softly i peter appleton do hereby renounce my membership in the american communist party and by way of purging myself of my indiscretion wish to provide the following names of
fellow members to this committee so that those persons may have the opportunity to do as i have done
he scans down the page
its a long list
he hears a meow
and turns to look
is standing in the bedroom doorway
he folds up and pockets the list
after a moment old tim appears in the doorway wringing his knit cap in his hands
can i t t talk to you
come on in
i was just packing
pete stands gestures old tim to the chair as he sits on the bed
theyll come back you know
theyll all c c come back
i dont know
they w w will
pete turns to old tim fixes him in the eye
tim i have to tell you something
its about me
pause as pete gathers courage and tries to find the words
im not luke
luke is dead
he died in the war
hes not coming back and im not him
i dont even belong here
this whole thing started out as an accident and thats all it is
my name isnt luke
old tim stands and looks askance at pete
did you think i didnt kn kn know that
taken aback i thought you
i know more than you give me c c credit thats for sure
dont you see it dont m m matter who you are
all that matters is what you g g gave us
and you cant take that away now
youre wrong peter appleton
you do belong here
he leans down to pete
you hafta give us back the b b bijou
old tim straightens up nods at pete
then silently he picks up cat and exits
pete and adele walk slowly down the platform toward the waiting train
youve got everything
except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact
youll be fine
no matter what leo kubelsky says youve got a hundred and seventy five years of american law on your side
dont forget that
i wish you were coming with me
and whos gonna run the projector until you get back
maybe we could train cat to run the projector
you know a system of scratching posts and gears and levers
they both smile as the trains horn blows
pete picks up his suitcase and they walk toward the passenger compartment
did you bring along something to read
adele pulls a pocket sized leather bound book out of her purse and hands it to pete
i didnt think so
this is mine you can borrow it
well worn and scuffed nevertheless the title is clear pete looks at the book then at adele
not exactly light reading i know
believe it or not ive read this since high school and it got me all the way through law school
besides theres something in there thatll help you
you wont have to get very far its near the beginning
clearly touched delly
thanks thank you
ill take good care of this
just remember two things
first the law is a living thing
it made us free and it keeps us free
sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes
sometimes it makes mistakes sometimes big mistakes
but in the end the law prevails for the just
sometimes it takes a while
whats the second thing
she thinks for a moment
she needs the right words
ill be here
if you come back
the train pulls out
adele and pete exchange waves as we the house committee on un american activities has effectively taken over the grand ballroom of this magnificent hotel and the joint is packed
to the rafters
members of the audience crane their necks to see out into the hallway from where the witnesses will be entering
the committee members are seated at their dais brightly lit by the dozens of newsreel and tv lights
elvin clyde is seated at the far right
dead center of the dais is the chairman congressman t
johnston doyle of wisconsin a husky man in his late s
he slams his gavel down several times and the room goes quiet the talking stops and the cameras start whirring
adeles in a chair eyes glues to the tv set
terwilliger and old tim sit on the couch watching attentively
doc lardners in a straight backed chair at a jaunty angle to the set holding the rabbit ears uncomfortably high aloft
thats perfect dad
the committee and the chamber will come to order
lardner forces a smile at mrs
terwilliger and old tim
sweating and wincing this televisions a grand little invention isnt it
the agenda for this mornings special session of the house committee on un american activities shows a number of witnesses and id like to admonish those that are here to
view the testimony of our first witness to keep order at all times or this chamber will be closed
im referring especially to the ladies and gentlemen of the press
i hope thats clear
doyle scans the room
he clearly means business
call peter appleton
all eyes and cameras swing toward the door
as he enters the chamber dozens of flashbulbs fire as every eye and every camera follows him silently to his seat
as he sits he glances behind him
leo kubelsky is sitting in the front row of spectators
he smiles and nods at pete
pete doesnt acknowledge him and turns back
the witness will please stand and raise his right hand
pete does as instructed
do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the united states house of representatives will be the truth the whole truth and nothing
but the truth so help you god
be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record
peter kenneth appleton
the chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today mr
we certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee
faint smile ill do my best mr
now were informed that you have a statement youd like to read is that correct
innocently a statement
doyle and clyde exchange glances
a prepared statement
i dont have a statement at this time
pete turns in his chair and winks at leo
leo rolls his eyes and shakes his head
adele breathes a sigh of relief
i think hes doing very well so far
they havent called out the dogs yet
very well then the questions will be asked by the majority counsel mr
the tv shot swings to see elvin clyde
he puts on his glasses and fixes pete with an oily grin
i spoke too soon
thank you mr
chairman and thank you mr
appleton for appearing today
appleton you mention that your home is hollywood california
but isnt it true that for the last several months youve made your home in a town called lawson california
sir that is true
appleton do you know an albert lucas trumbo
we never met
but id like to think i know him
is that because you were masquerading as luke trumbo while you were in lawson
clyde youre twisting things around
i wasnt masquerading
luke was a good man who gave his life for his country
happen to look a little bit like him
referring to notes yes i see that private trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead
i also see that you were posted stateside during the war
well im sure were all glad to see you came through it all right
a few spectators titter
mabel and bob listen to the hearing on a radio in the packed diner
now i see that youve been running a movie theater in lawson called the bijou is that also true
but i didnt go to lawson to run the bijou that was
that was something that just happened
you see i was involved in an accident in lawson and i spent some time recovering there
clyde holds up copies of the los angeles examiner and los angeles times with petes picture on the front page
anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your
an accident which conveniently came hard upon your dismissal from united pictures
tell us this accident of yours are we given to understand that it affected your memory
and what is the state of your memory now
im sorry what was the question
the audience laughs
clyde nods at pete forces a tight smile
your little note of levity mr
appleton but this is a very serious matter and it merits your fullest attention
back to business that state of your memory now mr
avery wyatt listens to the hearing on a store radio
spencer comes around the paint aisle wiping his hands on his apron
he moves to the radio and listens solemnly
sir are you referring to the fact that i was suffering from amnesia and ive since recovered my memory
impatient im interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past or if theyve been conveniently blotted out as a result of your accident
clyde i remember everything
holds up a piece of paper now i hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the bread instead of bullets club of the university of
california los angeles dated october
a copy of this paper is before you mr
do you recognize it
pete looks on the table and finds the roster
hes surprised to see it
yes i do
referring to line thirty seven of the document does your printed name and signature appear there
yes it does
appleton please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the bread instead of bullets club
clyde do you want to know what i knew then or do you want to know what i know now
theyre two different things
start with what you knew then
well id direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty six of the document and the name printed and signed there
we see it
for the record it reads lucille angstrom
whats the point of this
well thats what i knew then
or who i knew i should say
you see i was trying to court miss angstrom
i went to the meeting to impress her
grinning are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl
slyly well if youd seen miss angstrom
the audience laughs
doyle bangs his gavel
you asked for the truth
thats the truth
i had no idea what the meeting was about
i just sat through it so i could be near her
im sure even a majority counsel like yourself is familiar with the concept of impressing a girl
the audience laughs
clyde shoots a look at doyle who bangs his gavel
chamber will come to order
clyde shuffles some papers and looks back at pete
all right mr
that was what you knew then
what do you know now
takes a deep breath well i know that i lost my job because of one meeting i went to when i was a kid in college
i know that ive been branded a communist which im not but even if i was it shouldnt matter or what do we have a bill of rights for
chairman the witness is being non responsive
a few members of the audience applaud
as pete speaks their numbers grow
passionately i know that a lot of good honest decent people people that i consider my true friends feel betrayed by me not because of who and what i am
but because of what you say i am
i know that i
doyle bangs his gavel several times
pete stops and the room falls quiet
appleton you will respond to the questions of this committee without elaboration or speechmaking or the chair will find you in contempt of congress
you will not be warned again is that clear
he lets this sink in then continue mr
looking down at his desk mr
clyde takes a long pause for effect then looks up at pete
are you now or have you ever been a member of the communist party
holding up the roster are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony
im not refuting anything
yet youre contradicting yourself
you earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party run organization yet you just said under oath that you were not now nor ever a member of
the communist party
thats not a contradiction at all sir
i went to the meeting but i didnt go as a member
well then as what did you go
im a little hesitant to say
the witness need not be hesitant to say anything before this committee as long as its the truth
pete shifts in his chair then leans into the microphone
well i went as
a horny young man
the chamber erupts in laughter
even the other committee members are laughing except clyde and doyle who bangs his gavel vigorously
sheriff eldridge and daley thornhill listen to the hearing on the radio
they are both laughing at petes last comment
damn he dont wanna spar with these boys
theyll eat him alive
the room settles
doyle wags his finger accusingly at pete
appleton you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the united states congress
believe you me you do not want to incur our wrath
matter of factly im sorry sir i have no intention of making light of this committee
and i have no intention of incurring your wrath mr
i have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath
theyve sent me letters from jail
chairman the witness is making another speech
i would ask that mr
appleton be admonished
appleton there is no question before you at this time but im sure mr
clyde has plenty more prepared and if youd like to either answer them or plead the fifth amendment we can at least get on with the business of this committee
adele moves to within inches of the tv screen
tell them pete
wrestling with this mr
chairman as i understand it the fifth amendment pertains to self incrimination and i cant incriminate myself because ive done nothing wrong
besides incrimination is why you have mr
clyde working for you
clyde is still protesting but doyle waves him off
well then mr
appleton just what is your intention
petes sweating under the lights
hes bluffed his last bluff and hes on the ropes
he reaches into his pocket
and takes out the prepared statement
chairman i have a prepared statement id like to read
her hand goes to her mouth
go ahead mr
slowly reading i peter appleton do hereby
he stops suddenly
i need a drink of water
go ahead son
pete fills a glass from the pitcher
nervously he spills a bit and is splashes onto his coat
as some of the spectators chuckle pete brushes the water off
he reaches into his pocket and pulls out adeles copy of the constitution
the cover is wet
he wipes it off and sets it down on the table
he takes a sip of water
looks at the book
picks it up
petes terrified but in control
he speaks slowly hes making this up and thinking it out as he goes
that id like to invoke at this time but its not the fifth amendment
i wonder if youre familiar with it
appleton you will
he opens the book and reads tentatively at first
congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of
the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances
silence in the room
shes smiling at the tv
her eyes are filled with tears
he looks up at chairman doyle
now fully confident
thats the first amendment mr
its the backbone of this nation
its everything that gives us the potential to be right and good and just if only wed live up to that potential
its what gives me the right to sit in this chair and say my piece before this committee without fear
its the most important part of the contract that every citizen has with this country
and even though this contract
he holds up the book the constitution and the bill of rights even though theyre just pieces of paper with signatures on them theyre the only contracts we have that
are most definitely not subject to renegotiation
not by you mr
chairman not by you mr
clyde not by any member of this committee or anyone else ever
pin drop silence in the room
pete scans the faces of the panel
all betray anger
he cant help but smile and nod appreciatively
and when you get right down to it thats really all i have to say to this committee
and with that pete closes the book picks up the prepared statement rips it up pushes back his chair stands and walks toward the door
the cameras swing with him and flashbulbs fire like machine guns
doyle bangs his gavel insistently
the witness will resume his seat
did you hear me
you are not excused mr
and then slowly applause builds in the chamber reaching a crescendo as pete reaches the door and exits
as pete exits the hotel a dozen reporters and photographers have him completely surrounded
hes taken aback flustered
seeing pete there he is
are you going back to writing pictures
i dont know
you a commie pete
no of course not
what about the girl pete
you gonna marry her
is she coming to hollywood or are you
look fellas i dont have anything to say
pete is trapped in the crowd when he feels a hand on his shoulder
spins him around and pushes him through the crowd toward the curb
come on kid
at the curb is a black cadillac limousine
leo hauls open the back door and pushes pete in before climbing in himself
the limo drives away as the reporters give chase
leo and pete sit side by side in silence for a moment
leo breaks it
that was quite a show you gave them today
we shoulda sold tickets
im not sorry for what i said
no of course not why should you be sorry
youre the new peter appleton
you exercised your rights as a solid citizen first amendment freedom of speech all that
they sit in silence again for a moment until leo reaches into his pocket and withdraws a gold cigarette case which he opens and offers to pete
leo takes one for himself and lights up
pete takes off his hat and nervously scratches his head
whend you quit smoking
luke didnt smoke
oh i see
but youre not luke
youre peter appleton the picture writer
laughs not any more
leo you were in there you saw what i did
you think theyre gonna let me write pictures
hell theyre probably gonna throw my ass in jail
with a smile not at all
besides i dont even know if i want to write anymore
snickering what youre going to go back to that hick town and run the projector and marry the doctors daughter
but before pete can answer
peter im an agent
i buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you
thats what i do
youre a writer
you write pictures
thats what you do
and trust me youll be back doing it again tomorrow morning
what do you mean
kid you gave them what they wanted
this committee it feeds on names
the more names the better
but for some high profile witnesses like yourself any name will do
leo i didnt give them the names
i wouldnt do that
what all of a sudden lucille angstrom isnt a name
he slowly turns to leo
warily her name was right there in front of them
they gave it to me i didnt give it to them
well thats not what they think
leo she was
she was a girl i knew in college
you should keep track of your old school chums
turns out she eventually joined the communist party
takes a puff on top of which shes lucy angstrom hirschfeld now and she happens to be a writer for studio one on cbs
realization dawning oh god oh god no i
so our lawyers had a talk with the committees lawyers
that elvin clyde fella wont be too happy about it but we cut a deal
they cleared you and theyre gonna thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself
thank me publicly
for ruining this womans life
dismissive climb down off your cross
they already knew about her
off his look she was subpoenaed six months ago
who the hell do you think named you
pete is dumbstruck
he slumps in his seat ashen
he couldnt be happier all of which means
ashes to ashes is gonna be made and youve got your job back
takes a puff congratulations kid
petes breathing shallowly on the verge of tears or screaming or both
the limo pulls up and leo opens the door
pete vacantly grabs his suitcase and gets out
leo shuts the door and calls after him waving petes hat
pete comes back and takes his hat
leo grabs his hand
i was lookin out for you all the time kid
you did good
im real proud of you
to the driver okay lets go
to pete get some rest kid
as the limo pulls away we the door opens revealing the super followed by a sullen pete carrying his suitcases and hat
he sets them down and goes to the coffee table where his boxes of belongings from the studio have been gathering dust these last three months
handing him a key heres a new key for ya
kubelsky hes got you paid up through this month
you got one swell friend there
the super moves to the door and turns back
good to have you back pete
he exits as pete reaches into one of the boxes and pulls out the tin toy fire truck
distractedly pete puts the toy back in the box and replies too late thanks
he sets his suitcase down and takes off his coat
as he does adeles copy of the constitution slips out of his coat pocket and falls open to the floor
pete picks it up and absently turns it over and the inscription inside the front cover catches his eye pete closes the book
he thinks for a moment then glances over at the phone
he picks it up and dials
western union please
our view of the moving train is from outside as it speeds up the spectacular coastline north of santa barbara
looking into one of the trains windows we see pete sitting staring out at the passing scenery
dear adele on my way back to lawson stop
that is if theyll have me stop
train arrives four p
hope you can be there stop
the train is just pulling in to lawson
as it shudders to a halt the door of the passenger compartment opens and pete steps out looks and his jaw drops open
the entire town has turned out
theyre all there smiling broadly
a large hand lettered banner reads a cheer goes up from the crowd breaking the silence
pete descends from the train and moves into the throng
the first two people he encounters are bob leffert and mabel lanier
bob sticks out his good hand and pete takes it both smiling as they shake hands vigorously
um i mean pete if it werent for you i wouldnt have had the nerve to ask this fine woman to marry me
mabels mouth drops open
whend you ask her
to bob yes bob
as mabel kisses bob for all shes worth pete continues into the crowd where hes kissed embraced patted on the back
is at the back of the crowd working her way to the front
she rushes into petes arms and they kiss
another cheer goes up
i see you got the telegram
pete im so sorry about what they did to you
i didnt think youd come back i thought youd want to write again
dell i cant write unless im happy and i cant be happy unless im here and with you
grabs her shoulders this is me delly
and i love you
tears in her eyes and hic
i love you pete
they kiss again
pete pulls away and looks at his watch
smiling cmon dell we gotta go
showtime in fifteen minutes
the train whistle blows as it slowly pulls out of the station
happily ever after is a relative term folks
my world is much smaller now and my dreams are very different than they were
but i have something now that i never had before i have the magic
and its for sale at the bijou every day of the year
all you need is the price of a ticket
we boom up to see pete and adele moving into and being enveloped by the crowd
spencer wyatts band is assembled in front of the depot office and they kick into some up tempo boogie woogie as we move up and away still in the same
shot moving over the town settling down again to grab a shot of the bijous marquee
the neon chaser lights pop on illuminating the sign which reads then the letters on the marquee start shaking
we boom up to the top of the theater and the bijou sign
as the train rumbles by behind the theater
and the j teeters loose and swings by a thread
and we iris down on it and
