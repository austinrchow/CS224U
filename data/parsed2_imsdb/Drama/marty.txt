written by paddy chayefsky just east of webster avenue in the north bronx th street is a predominantly italian community and the commercial avenue of the neighborhood
fruit and vegetable stands pizzerias butcher shops bakeries cleaners and dyers and bars flourish
it is saturday morning around eleven oclock a market day
women dark gesticulative with bulging cloth shopping bags baby carriages
merchants at their improvised street stands hawking their wares disputing with their customers roaring salutations to passersby
in the midst of all this camera homes in on a typical neighborhood
delicatessens hang on the walls wreathed with garlands of garlic
patsy the boss a swarthy man of sixty is flopping a chunk of beef onto the scale for the benefit of a forty year old matron
there are three or four other women in the shop all talking to one another
a four year old boy lazily chases a cat
the white refrigerator room door opens and a second butcher marty pilletti comes out carrying a large leg of lamb
marty is a mildmannered short stout balding man of thirty four
his charm lies in an almost indestructible good humor
he drops the leg of lamb onto the chopping block reaches up for the cleaver hanging with the other utensils over the block and makes quick incisive cuts into the
leg of lamb
he sets the cleaver aside picks up the saw to finish the cuts as he chats with his customer mrs

thomas has moved off to join his wife in the kitchen where we can hear them exchanging final protestations and goodbys with mrs
marty sits at the table hands folded in front of him stolid pensive
pilletti bends over her steaming kettles
through the window we see evening is gathering
its a small room with bed chest of drawers religious pictures etc
marty sits squatly on the edge of the bed absorbed in thought
he stands moves out into
and down that into
now lit by the overhead neo tiffany lampshade and the beaded old fashioned lamps
he crosses to the kitchen door looks in on his mother cooking away turns crosses back to
he closes the sliding doors that separate the living and dining rooms
he extracts a small black address book from his hip pocket flips through it finds the page he wants studies it intently
he sits on the chair by the phone dials
with a vague pretense at good diction hello is this mary feeney
could i speak to miss mary feeney
just tell her an old friend
he waits again
with his free hand he wipes the gathering sweat on his brow
oh hello there is this mary feeney
hello there this is marty pilletti
i wonder if you recall me
well im kind of a stocky guy
the last time we met was in a movie the rko chester
you was with another girl and i was with a friend of mine named angie
this was about a month ago
the girl apparently doesnt remember him
a sort of panic begins to seize marty
his voice rises a little
the rko chester in westchester square
you was sitting in front of us and we was annoying you and you got mad and
im the fellow who works in a butcher shop
come on you know who i am
thats right we went to howard johnsons and we had hamburgers

well how about the saturday after that
yeah i know
oh i understand i mean
he hangs up sits for a moment then rises opens the sliding doors enters
he sits at the heavy wooden table with its white on white table cloth
pilletti ladles portions of food from the steaming kettles onto a plate that she brings into
and sets it down before her son
without a word he picks up his fork and spoon and plunges into the mountain of spaghetti adds cheese eats away
pilletti takes her seat folds her hands on the table and sits watching marty eat
so what are you gonna do tonight marty
i dont know ma
im all knocked out
i may just hang arounna house
pilletti nods a couple of times
a moment of silence
why dont you go to the stardust ballroom
this gives marty pause
he looks up
i say why dont you go to the stardust ballroom
its loaded with tomatoes
marty regards his mother for a moment
its loaded with what
who told you about the stardust ballroom
he told me it was a very nice place
ma its just a big dance hall and thats all it is
i been there a hundred times
loaded with tomatoes
boy youre funny ma
marty i dont want you hang arounna house tonight
i want you to go take a shave and go out and dance
ma when are you gonna give up

sooner or later there comes a point in a mans life when he gotta face some facts and one fact i gotta face is that whatever it is that women
like i aint got it
i chased enough girls in my life
i went to enough dances
i got hurt enough
i dont wanna get hurt no more
i just called a girl just now and i got a real brush off boy
i figured i was past the point of being hurt but that hurt

a fat ugly man

his voice rising im ugly

he stands abruptly his face pained and drawn
he makes half formed gestures to his mother but he cant find words at the moment
he turns and marches a few paces away turns to his mother again
ma waddaya want from me
waddaya want from me
im miserable enough as it is
leave me alone
ill go to the stardust ballroom
ill put onna blue suit and ill go
and you know what im gonna get for my trouble
a big night of heartache
sullenly he marches back to his seat sits down picks up his fork plunges it into the spaghetti stuffs a mouthful into his mouth and chews vigorously for a moment
it is impossible for him to remain angry long
after a while he is shaking his head
loaded with tomatoes
boy thats rich
he plunges his fork in again starts to eat
pilletti watches marty anxiously as we
west farms square is a big street in the bronx filled with stores bowling alleys and bars
cars push along between the pillars of the elevated subway structure
the noise of the subway trains roars by overhead every few moments
camera finds and establishes the stardust ballroom
it occupies the second floor of a large dirty gray three story building
it is a hot june night and the windows are open for ventilation purposes
music manufactured by dave greenglass and his band blends with the noises of the street
music plays in the background
camera views clara a plain girl in her late twenties her younger sister millie prettier millies fiance andy and a second young man dr
keegan also who is a resident at fordham hospital
they are all huddled over a cigarette machine near the street door
in a low voice i told you she wasnt especially attractive but that she had a good deal of charm and shes really a real nice girl
extracting cigarettes from the machine shes all right andy
its just that i get one saturday night off every three weeks and i was expecting something better thats all
i told you she wasnt attractive
you told me that she was a little tall but that she wasnt bad looking at all
millies been after me to fix her up with a date so i
all right im having a fair time
its just that i get one saturday night off in three weeks and i wanted to wind up with something tonight
they join the two girls waiting for them and start up the broad stairway to the second floor
they are halfway up when two girls come in at the top of the stairs and start down
keegan who is holding claras arm looks up nods
this is a small carpeted lobby with ticket taker in booth a cloak room and rest rooms
painted posters on the walls announce coming events and caution against smoking
there are also large blow ups of musicians who had played this ballroom at one time and went on to bigger things
about six or seven people congregate in the lobby engaged in various indifferent activities
camera angles include the swinging doors as clara andy millie and dr
keegan come in
as they enter the doors to the ballroom proper are pushed out and a girl in a black dress quite pretty comes in
she starts across the anteroom toward the cloak room when dr
keegan calls out suddenly to her
the girl turns
recognition floods her face
wadda you doing here
i came up to dance wadda you think
you here with somebody
im just here with another girl
where you going now
im just gonna get my cigarettes
i left them in my coat
ill see you around
ill see you
she turns and continues on to the cloak room
keegan turns to clara
thats a girl used to know
a fairly long room lined on one side by a bar and on the other by cheap leatherette booths
it is brightly lit and crowded
there is a constant movement in and out of the lounge
at the far end of the lounge there are two large iron fire doors open to allow the heat to flow out
dance music from dance floor
keegan millie and andy come into the lounge and form a little group in the midst of moving passersby around them
a kind of strange excitement has begun to enter dr
he stands with the others but his attention is devoted to ogling the passing girls occasionally looking back to the doors leading to the anteroom
boy its packed in here
to clara some of these kids are awful young
arent you afraid youll bump into one of your students
nervously looking at dr
keegan i wouldnt think so
i teach out in brooklyn
you been up here before clara
shall we try to get a table and get something to drink or shall we just go in and start dancing
keegan doesnt seem to hear
continues hey herbie
you wanna have a drink before we start dancing
you people go grab a table
ill be back inna minute
ill be right back
he turns and moves quickly through the crowded lounge back to the swinging doors leading into the anteroom
camera stays with clara millie and andy staring after him
so what do you say clara
wanna see if we can get a table
they turn and move toward the booths
the dance floor is fairly dark
a romantic effect is achieved by papier mache over the chandeliers
around the walls are the stag lines the men and waiting girls
they stand singly or in small uneasy groups
there is constant flux and movement
camera dollies slowly past the stag line moving past faces short fat tall thin stags
some pretend indifference
some exhibit patent hunger
camera holds angling to include marty angie near the end of the stag line
they are freshly shaved and groomed
they are leaning against the wall smoking watching their more fortunate brethren on the floor in the background
not a bad crowd tonight you know
there was one nice looking one there inna black dress and beads but shes dancing now
looking off screen theres a nice looking little short one for you right now
following his gaze where
that little one there
reverse angle past marty and angie across the dance floor toward the wall opposite where three girls are standing
two are leaning against the wall
the third is facing them with her back to the dance floor
this last girl is the one angie has in mind
she is a cute little kid about twenty and wears a bright smile
they stare off toward the three girls across the room
yeah she looks all right from here
well waddaya say you wanna ask them
ill take the one inna green dress
i think this number is a little fast
wait a minute
he tries a few tentative steps testing for tempo
its all right i think
they still there
the two cavaliers turn their heads and look off screen in the direction of the three girls
apparently the girls are still there
marty and angie relinquish their lounging positions against the wall and slouch along past the line of stags with a show of determined unconcern
they edge through the crush of people on the non dancing margin of the dance floor and slowly push their way toward the
marty and angie come in and start to approach the three girls
the girls aware of the boys presence stiffen and their chatter comes to a halt
angie advances to one of the girls
waddaya say you wanna dance
the girl looks surprised as if this were an extraordinary invitation to receive in a dance hall looks confounded at her two friends shrugs detaches herself from the wall moves
to the outer fringe of the pack of dancers raises her hand languidly to dancing position and awaits angie with ineffable boredom
marty smiling tentatively addresses the excuse me would you care for this dance
the short girl gives marty a quick glance of appraisal then looks quickly at her remaining friend
but not unpleasantly i dont feel like dancing just yet
he turns and heads sluggishly in the direction of the stag line
a travel shot follows marty as he moves past the line of stags all of whom are watching him
camera holds as he finds his old niche by the wall leans there
a moment later he glances guardedly down to where the short girl and her friend are
the short girl is approached by a dapper young boy who asks her to dance
she smiles excuses herself to her friend and follows the boy out onto the dance floor
marty stares at the short girl
he shrugs hes used to this kind of thing then turns his attention bleakly back to watching
the band starts up again and the music blares
its a lindy hop number
couples swirl past the music comes up big
marty leans against the wall smoking and watching the dancers swirl past
keegans voice is heard
off screen you here stag or with a girl
martys attention is on the passing couples so he doesnt seem to hear
angle widens to include the doctor standing on martys right
suddenly aware of the doctor marty turns his head
you say something
i was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl
well ill tell you
i got stuck on a blind date with a dog and i just met an old girl i used to know and i was wondering how im gonna get rid
of the girl im with
somebody to take her home you know what i mean
id be glad to pay you five bucks if you take her home for me
ill take you over and ill introduce you as an old army buddy of mine and then ill cut out
because i got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck and ill pay you five bucks
stares at the man are you kidding
no im not kidding
you cant just walk off onna girl like that
keegan shrugs moves down the line of stag guys
marty turns to watch him still a little shocked at the proposition
the doctor approaches three stags and obviously broaches the subject with one of them
this stag seems more receptive to the idea
keegan takes out a wallet and gives the stag a five dollar bill
the stag detaches himself from the wall and a little ill at ease follows the doctor
marty stands against the wall watching the doctor and the stag who come in and move past him
concerned and curious marty stares after them then moves out of his leaning position following in their general direction
marty moves through the crush of young men and women in the area around the dance floor
as marty reaches the alcove that separates the dance floor proper from the lounge he pauses and looks off toward the booths
clara sits about halfway down the length of the booths
keegan and the stag stand over her talking to her
she is looking up at them her hands nervously gripping a coca cola glass
keegan is obviously introducing the stag to clara and is going through some story about being called away on an emergency
the stag is presented as her escort to be who will see to it that she gets home safely
clara is not taken in by any of this although she is trying hard not to seem affected
she politely rejects the stags company and will go home by herself thanks for asking anyway
keegan makes a few mild protestations and then he and the stag leave the booth and start back toward the archway
from where marty stands he can watch clara as well as dr
keegan and the stag
the doctor and the stag start past marty and he catches their conversation
in that case as long as shes going home alone give me the five bucks back
look mac you paid me the five bucks
i was willing
its my five bucks
they move past and away and marty stares after them before he turns his attention toward clara off screen
clara is sitting as she was gripping and ungripping the glass of coca cola in front of her
her eyes are closed
then with a little nervous shake of her head she gets out of the booth and stands momentarily at a loss for what next to do
as she glances around camera angles to include a sign over an exit that reads fire escape
clara starts moving toward that door
marty is staring off screen toward clara
he slowly works his way down the length of the lounge in the general direction of the fire escape
near the entrance to the fire escape clara comes into view
background sounds continue steadily
marty is walking the length of the lounge and suddenly stops and stares off screen
clara disappears through the exit onto the fire escape outside
then he continues on crossing the threshold of the
it is sizeable almost a small balcony
it looks out onto the backs of innumerable five story apartment houses
clara is standing by the railing her back toward the camera her head sunk down
she is crying
marty watches her for a moment before moving a step or two forward
clara doesnt turn
marty tries to think of something to say
finally excuse me miss would you care to dance
clara slowly turns to marty her face streaked with tears her lips trembling
then in one of those moments of simultaneous impulse she lurches to marty with a sob and marty takes her to him
they stand in an awkward embrace marty a little embarrassed looking back through the fire escape doors to the lounge wondering if anybody is seeing them
he reaches back with one hand and contrives with some effort to push one of the heavy iron doors shut
he returns his hand around the girls shoulders
he stands stiffly allowing her to cry on his chest as we
pilletti in her hat and coat and carrying a purse is making her heavy way up the last few steps toward the landing
she pauses to catch her breath on the landing
then she moves down the hallway to
pilletti rings the bell
the sound can be heard as she waits
the door is opened by virginia
hello aunt theresa
pilletti enters the apartment
virginia closes the door after mrs
pilletti enters and they stand in a small narrow hallway brightly lit
at the far end to the right is the living room in the background
in a low voice as she pulls off her coat is catherine here
virginia helps her with her coat
nods keeping her voice low we didnt tell her anything yet
we thought that wed leave it to you
we thought youd put it like how you were lonely and why dont she come to live with you
because that way it looks like shes doing you a favor insteada were throwing her out and it wont be so cruel on her
do you want tommy and me to stay here with you
i think it be a better idea if you and thomas go out because otherwise shes gonna start a fight with you and everybodys gonna be yelling
thomas appears at the living room end of the foyer with an anxious smile on his face
hello aunt theresa
i just this minute got the baby to sleep
he comes down to mrs
pilletti and virginia lowers his voice to a conspiratorial whisper
aunt theresa we figure the best way to ask her is you say that youre very lonely see
and wouldnt she come and keep you company because that way you see
im gonna take care a the whole thing
a shrill imperious womans voice breaks into the whispered conference in the hallway
off screen whos there
pilletti heads up the foyer to the living room followed by virginia and thomas
calling back its me catherine
how you feel
catherine comes in at the end of the foyer
she is a gaunt woman with a face carved out of granite
she is tough embittered with a history of pain and mirthless hard work ingrained into her features
what are you doing here
i came to see you
how you feel
the two sisters quickly embrace and release each other
i gotta pain in my left side and my leg throbs like a drum
i been getting a pain in my shoulder
i gotta pains in my shoulder too
i have a pain in my hip and my right arm aches so much i cant sleep
its a curse to be old
how you feel
i feel fine
now that the standard greetings are over aunt catherine abruptly turns and goes back into the living room
virginia and thomas remain in the doorway
catherine and mrs
pilletti enter and catherine heads straight to a chair obviously her chair
it is an old heavy oaken chair with thick armrests
the rest of the apartment is furnished in what is known as modern
a piece from house beautiful here a piece from american homes and gardens there
aunt catherine sits erect and forbidding in her chair
pilletti seats herself with a sigh in a neighboring chair
thomas and virginia remain off screen in the hallway for a moment to hang up mrs
the two old sisters sit for a moment
well hows everything with you
aunt catherine grimaces to describe how everything is with her
my son martys fine
thomas comes in from the hallway stands in the back of the room somewhat apprehensively
we gotta postcard from my son nickie and his bride
theyre inna big hotel in florida on their honeymoon
everything is very nice
i gotta letter from my husbands cousin in abruzzi
his mother died
do you remember emilio digiorgio owned the tavern in abruzzi
i dont think i remember him
well he died
you know who else died
you know the old man upstairs in this house
old irishman always drunk
he got pleurisy
he was inna hospital two weeks
he died yesterday
well i always like to visit you catherine because you always got such cheerful news
virginia comes into the living room with thomas
they remain in the background
suddenly ma you want something to eat some tuna fish
hey why dont you go to the movie
your mother and me were gonna be baby sitter
thomas looks indecisively at his wife
listen lets go downa kaplans apartment
they told us to come down
thomas ponders a moment
all right ma were going downstairs to the kaplans if you want us for anything
the two old sisters sit rigidly until they hear the sound of the door closing
catherine cocks an eyebrow and promptly launches into her statement
i wake up this morning i hear the baby crying
so i wake up
i come in their room
that girl is shaking her hand atta baby
i said you brute
dont you strike that baby
thats my sons baby
its her baby too you know
thats my son thomass baby
well it aint your baby
did i tell you she threw the bottle a milk at me
you told me
shes a witch that one
i tell you what happen yesterday
she gave me the evil eye
she demonstrates this by pulling the lower lid of one eye down and staring grotesquely at the ceiling
i keep one eye open when i sleep because shes gonna come in stab me in my bed
catherine i want you come live in my house with marty and me
her sister turns genuinely surprised at this request
you son thomas and virginia they come to my house this afternoon
your son thomas and his wife virginia
when was this
this afternoon about four five oclock
what they say
you know what they say
they say things are no good in this house
catherine your son is married
leave him in peace
he wantsa be alone with his wife
they dont want no old lady sitting inna balcony
now i tell you what i think
i want you come live with me in my house with marty and me
in my house you have your own room
you dont have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here
we will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls
you are dear to me and you are dear to marty
we are pleased for you to come
catherine surveys her sister coldly
my son thomas came to see you this afternoon and he said to you he wants to cast his mother from his house
catherine dont make an opera outta this
the three a you anna baby live in three skinny rooms
you are an old goat and she has an italian temper
she is a good girl but you drive her crazy
catherine you are no fool
you know this is no good an old woman living with a husband and wife
two women inna same kitchen anna house burns down
catherine stands abruptly
she is deeply hurt
so i am an old garbage bag put inna street
oh catherine please
dont make a tragedy
you come to my house where you know you be happier yourself
it pains that they should do this
i know it pains
catherine turns and meanders a few steps
the stiff edge of mordant humor that has been her one defense against life has deserted her and she is just a hurt old lady now
these are the worst years i tell you
she seats herself on an eames chair
on her right a modern age lamp towers slimly
on her left is a modern age endtable with a modern age ashtray on it
the hardened muscles in her face suddenly slacken
with deep compassion catherine you are very dear to me
we have cried many times together
when my husband died i would have gone insane if it were not for you
i ask you to come to my house because i can make you happy
please come to my house
these are the worst years
i tell you
its gonna happen to you
im afraida look inna mirror
im afraid im gonna see an old lady with white hair like the old ladies inna park little bundles inna black shawl waiting for the coffin
im fifty six years old
what am i to do with myself
i have strength in my hands
i wanna cook
i wanna clean
i wanna make dinner for my children
am i an old dog to lie in fronta the fire til my eyes close
these are the terrible years theresa
catherine my sister
catherine stares distraught at mrs
its gonna happen to you
its gonna happen to you
what will you do if marty gets married
what will you cook
what happen to alla children playing in alla rooms
where is the noise
it is a curse to be a widow
what will you do if marty gets married
what will you do
she stares at mrs
pilletti her deep eyes haggard and pained
pilletti stares back for a moment then her own eyes close
catherine has hit home
catherine sinks back onto her chair sitting stiffly her arms on the thick armrests
pilletti sits hunched a little forward her hands folded nervously in her lap
continuing quietly i will put my clothes inna bag and i will come to you tomorrow
the two sisters somber and silent continue to just stare at one another
camera pans the crowd picking up marty and clara dancing cheek to cheek on the crowded darkened dance floor
the music rides over the top of the scene
you come up here often
i was up here twice before
once with a friend of mine and once i came up alone
the last time
do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there
well the last time i was up here thats where i sat
i sat there for an hour and a half without moving a muscle
now and then some fellow would sort of walk up to me and then change his mind
ill never forget just sitting there for an hour and a half with my hands in my lap
then i began to cry and i had to get up and go home
i cry a lot too
im a big cryer
this is something recent with me this bursting into tears at the least thing
oh i cry all the time any little thing
my brothers my brother in laws theyre always telling me what a goodhearted guy i am
well you dont get goodhearted by accident
you get kicked around long enough you get to be a real professor of pain
i know exactly how you feel
and i also want you to know im having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself
so you see youre not such a dog as you think you are
im having a very good time too
so there you are
so i guess im not such a dog as i think i am
youre a very nice guy and i dont know why some girl hasnt grabbed you off long ago
i dont know either
i think im a very nice guy
i also think im a pretty smart guy in my own way
clara smiles briefly at this
now i figure two people get married and they gonna live together forty fifty years
so its just gotta be more than whether theyre good looking or not
you tell me you think youre not very good looking
my father was a really ugly man but my mother adored him
she told me that she used to get so miserable sometimes like everybody you know
and she says my father always tried to understand
i used to see them sometimes when i was a kid sitting in the living room talking and talking and i used to adore my old man because he was
thats one of the most beautiful things i have in my life the way my father and mother were
and my father was a real ugly man
so it doesnt matter if you look like a gorilla
so you see dogs like us we aint such dogs as we think we are
they dance silently for a moment cheeks pressed against each other
im twenty nine years old
how old are you
im thirty four
marty and clara are about halfway down the steps leading to the street entrance to the ballroom
clara has on a light summer coat
marty is about two steps ahead of her and has to keep turning his head to talk to her
he is in an elevated mood intoxicated on a talking jag
you teach chemistry
benjamin franklin high school
benjamin franklin wheres that
i went to theodore roosevelt right up here on fordham road
its right arounna corner from my house
i have a cousin whos a teacher
he teaches latin
he lives in chicago
he was studying to be a jesuit but he gave it up after his first vows
he has reached the street landing and waits for clara to catch up with him
they stand in front of the glass doors leading to the street
prattling on i was pretty good in high school
i sound like a jerk now but i was pretty good
i graduated with an eighty two average
that aint bad
i was accepted at city college
i filled out the application and everything but my old man died so i hadda go to work
my best class was german
that was my first language
der die das des der des
there you are i still remember
he pushes the glass door open to
as marty and clara emerge onto the sidewalk of west farms square they pause again
it is about nine oclock and the busy street is brightly lit from the stores
passersby hurry on their way
the elevated subway rumbles over head intermittently
chattering on you know what i was good at in high school
i was good in math
you know how long ago i graduated high school
june nineteen thirty seven
june nineteen thirty seven
what is that
fifteen seventeen years ago
seventeen years ago
is that right
seventeen thats right
where did it all go
im getting old
im gonna be thirty five november eighth
time goes on boy
he takes her arm and they start walking
nineteen thirty seven
my old man died december nineteen thirty seven
moving shot as they stroll toward the corner of jerome and burnside avenues
two oclock in the morning he died
the doorbell rings and i knew something was wrong right away
because my room is onna ground floor inna front you see and i got outta bed and i answered the door
camera holds as marty caught in his story stops and continues intently
there was mr
he had a house down about a block from us
he moved out though
my old man he used to play cards with him and some other old guys
hes a jewish feller
so he said is your mother home
so i knew right away there was something wrong
i was only eighteen exactly eighteen years old just the month before
so i said is something wrong mr
i was in my pajamas you know
so he said marty your father died
my father died right inna middle of playing cards right at the table
he had a heart attack
he had low blood pressure my old man
he used to faint a lot
suddenly he looks at clara rather startled
boy am i talking i never talked so much in my life
usually everybody comes to me and tells me all their troubles
well im gonna shut up now and im gonna let you get a word in
he takes her arm again and they continue strolling toward the corner intersection in silence
seventeen years ago
what i been doing with myself all that time
well im talking again
i must be driving you crazy
mosta the time im with a girl i cant find a word to say
well im gonna shut up now
because im not like this usually
well here i go again
they reach the corner intersection
camera holds on marty as he pauses again
he stares at clara confused at his strange loquacity
i cant shut my mouth
im on a jag for petes sake
youd think i was loaded
marty stares at clara absolutely aghast at his inability to stop talking
i cant stop talking
isnt this stupid
he stands there in the middle of the sidewalk with people moving past back and forth
marty continues to stare at clara his broad face widened by a foolish confused smile
clara regards him affectionately
with sudden sincerity you gotta real nice face you know
its really a nice face
they stroll along farther up the noisy jangled trafficked saturday night avenue
once a candy store now a soda fountain where booths have been installed in the rear
one wall of the luncheonette in front is covered with magazines from floor to ceiling
it is a nice clean joint brightly lit
several customers are occupying three of the four booths
they sit opposite each other in the booth
each has a cup of coffee
marty is still talking but now he is apparently telling a story so funny that he can hardly get the words out
the hilarity has communicated itself to clara
her eyes are burning with suppressed laughter
every now and then she has to gasp to control the bubbly giggling inside of her
so im inna kneeling position and if you ever try shooting a bar inna kneeling position you know what i mean
i cant holda steady position
im wavering back and forth
he has to interrupt the narrative to control a seizure of giggles
clara wipes her eyes and catches her breath
so the guy next to me hes shooting from the prone position and hes cross eyed like i told you
he cant go on
he has to stop and cover his face with one hand
so just then
stops to control himself again so just then i hear five shots go off from the guy next to me
its too much for him
he lets out a sudden guffaw and instantly smothers it under shaking shoulders
clara hides her face in her hands and giggles desperately
some of the other people turn to look at them
so my target goes down and a minute later the flag comes up
i got five bulls eyes
this cross eyed guy next to me he shot five bulls eyes into my target
he stares at the girl spent from laughter
so i said to the sergeant who was checking my score pretty good eh sarge
five bulls eyes
so this sergeant he dont know what happened he says say thats all right pilletti
he closes his eyes shakes his head
so thats what happened
thats how i got the reputation a being the best shot inna whole battalion
for a moment they seem to have controlled their laughter
they sit shaking their heads studying their fingers on the table in front of them
then slowly marty begins to giggle again
it communicates itself to clara
in a moment they are hiding their faces in their hands their shoulders shivering with laughter
close on angie
his eyes look slowly in every direction
camera pulls back disclosing angie standing on the fringe of the dance floor head arched high looking at the crowded dance floor
he starts back to the archway toward the lounge looking over his shoulder
angie comes into the archway throws one more glance over his shoulder at the dance floor then turns and enters the
angie walks down the length of the lounge looking into the booths and simultaneously at the people moving back and forth in the lounge
at the far end of the lounge he turns and comes back along the bar side checking each face at the bar
there are three young buckoes laying out their money for admission
one of them calls to angie
anything good in there mac
a buncha dogs
he crosses to the mens room
angie comes into a momentarily empty room
angie goes the full length of the white tiled room past the wash bowls the long mirror bending to look under the doors of the stalls
suddenly he calls out
hey marty you in here
he waits for an answer
close on marty and clara still in the booth but two more cups of coffee have been set down in front of each of them
there are also two pie plates
clara has left half of her pie
also an empty pack of cigarettes and another pack half gone
they are both smoking
marty is still talking but the mood is no longer laughter
a pensive speculative hush has fallen over them
they have been talking for hours and they have reached the stage where you start tearing designs in the paper napkins
when i got outta the army clara i was lost
i didnt know what i wanted to do
i was twenny five years old what was i gonna do go back to my old job forty cents an hour
i thought maybe i go to college under the g
biller rights you know
but i wouldnt graduate till i was twenny eight twenny nine years old even if i made it in three years
and my brother freddie wanted to get married and i had three unmarried sisters in an italian home thats a terrible thing
and my kid brother nickie hes a one got married last week
so i just went to pieces
i used to walk inna streets till three four oclock inna mornings
my mother used to be so worried about me
my uncle mario come over one time
he offered me a job driving his hack onna night shift
he got his own cab you know
and god forgive me for what im gonna say now but i used to thinka doing away with myself
i used to stand sometimes in the subway and god forgive me what im going to say i used to feel the tracks sucking me down under the wheels
deeply sympathetic yes i know
im a catholic you know and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin
yes i know
so then mr
gazzara he was a frienda my father he offered me this job in his butcher shop and everybody pleaded with me to take it
so thats what happened
i didnt wanna be a butcher
theres nothing wrong with being a butcher
well i wouldnt call it an elegant profession
its in a lower social scale
people look down on butchers
marty looks quickly up at her then back down
well the point is mr
gazzara wantsa sell his shop now because he and his wife are lonely and they wanna move out to california in los angeles and live near their married daughter
because shes always writing them to come out there
so its a nice little shop
i handle his books for him so i know he has a thirty five percent markup which is not unreasonable and he takes home net maybe a hundred hundred and
fifty bucks a week
the point is of course you gotta worry about the supermarkets
theres two inna neighborhood now and theres an a p coming in at least thats the rumor
of course mosta his trade is strictly italian but the younger italian girls they get married and they dont stick to the old italian dishes so much
i mean you gotta take that into account too
its my feeling that you really want to buy this shop marty
but im gonna have to take outta loan inna bank eight thousand dollars
thats a big note to carry because i have to give mr
gazzara a mortgage and what i have to weigh is will it pay off in the end more than i can make onna salary
clara looks down at her fingers her face alive and sensitive
she carefully assembles her words in her mind
then she looks at the squat butcher across the table from her
marty i know you for three hours but i know youre a good butcher
youre an intelligent sensitive decent man
i have a feeling about you like sometimes a kid comes in to see me for one reason or another
and some of these kids marty in my classes they have so much warmth in them so much capacity
and thats the feeling i get about you
marty shuts his eyes then opens them quickly bows his head
if you were one of my students i would say go ahead and buy the butcher shop
youre a good butcher
not quite trusting the timbre of his voice well theres a lotta things i could do with this shop
i could organize my own supermarket
get a buncha neighborhood merchants together
thats what a lotta them are doing
he looks up at her now
wadda you think
i think anything you want to do youll do well
tears begin to flood his eyes again
he quickly looks away
he licks his lips
still looking down im catholic
are you catholic
clara looks down at her hands
also in a low voice yes i am
marty looks up at her
i only got about three bucks on me now but i just live about eight blocks from here on the other side of webster avenue
why dont we walk back to my house
ill run in pick up some dough and lets step out somewhere
i really should get home
she twists in her seat and looks toward the back of the luncheonette
its only a quarter of twelve
the clocks right over there
i really should get home i told my father
well i suppose a little while longer
i wonder if theres any place around here i could put some makeup on
marty considers this problem for a second then leans out of the booth and calls out
camera angles to include the proprietor of the luncheonette
he is sitting in one of the booths ahead reading the sunday mirror
he looks up toward marty
you gotta ladies room around here
to clara inna back
clara smiles at this innocent gaucherie then edges out of the booth taking her purse with her
high angle shot of angie meandering down the street on which the neighborhood bar is located
it is near midnight and the street is empty except for angie and the clacking of his leather heels on the pavement
he comes to the bar opens the door enters
the sounds of saturday night revelry are loud coming mostly from the irish contingent of the neighborhood
they are grouped along practically the whole bar
three or four women and a number of shirtsleeved men mostly in their late forties early fifties
we know theyre irish because one of the younger men is chanting an auld country ballad
camera angles disclose the entrance to the bar in the background showing angie coming in looking here and there
he starts toward the bar
two irish women middle aged squat heavily on bar stools over their schooners of beer gassing away at each other
so she told me that the doctor told her that if she had any more babies she would do so at the risk of her life
angie shuffles in pausing near the bar and standing behind the two irish women
she was always a bit thin in the hips
well at the time she told me this she already had six
every time i saw the woman she was either
going to the hospital or coming from it
she was hatching them out like eggs
and that husband of hers is a skinny bit of a fellow isnt he
well i bumped into her on the street and she was as big as a barrel
loudly hey lou
camera angles to include lou the bartender
looking up from opening a batch of beer bottles what
so i said to her mary
calling to the bartender marty been in here the last coupla hours or so
mary for heavens sakes didnt you tell me that another onell kill you
i aint seen marty all night
and her husband is a little bit of a man isnt he
calling to the bartender but even more to himself where is everybody
i been walking around i cant find anybody
well last week tuesday she gave birth to the baby in saint elizabeths hospital
a big healthy boy of nine pounds
oh thats nice
so the doctor was wrong wasnt he
she died right in the hospital
oh thats a sad story
and her husband is that little fellow works in peter reeves
thats the one
oh thats a sad story
angie has nothing better to do than give his attention to the last lines of the story
perturbed he turns and leaves
with street noises over the scene marty and clara walk along through the intricate understructure of the elevated subway toward webster avenue
marty and clara walk slowly along a side street in martys neighborhood
the streets are almost empty perhaps an occasional pedestrian on the other side of the street
the cars are parked bumper to bumper in lines along the curb
the five story apartment buildings are mostly dark an occasional window lit
marty suddenly stops and bends down his shoe lace has become untied
clara sits back against the fender of the nearest car and continues talking
its really a fine opportunity for me
but im not sure i want to be a department head
its mostly executive and administrative work
well anyway i told you about my father and he depends on me a great deal and
still concentrating on his shoelace why dont you just move out to portchester
well thats what i was saying
my father is getting old
and were very close
hes a wonderful man really
she pauses as he straightens
he looks at her a moment
i think youre kidding yourself clara
i used to think about moving out you know
and thats what i used to say
my mother needs me
but when you really get down to it that aint it at all
actually you need your father
you know what i mean
youre living at home and you got your father and mother there and you can go on like that being a little girl all your life
im afraid of being lonely
oh you wont be so lonely
youll make friends right away
actually i dont make friends easily
whatre you talking about
youre a real likeable person
youll make friends out there in portchester one two three
youll have people visiting you alla time
ill come visit you
ill borrow my brother freddies car or you can call me up when you feel blue or ill call you up
and its gonna be nice
dont be so afraid
they have only gone a few paces farther when martys shoelace comes loose again
he fidgets self consciously bends down and begins to retie it
the voice of ralph the well dressed man established previously is heard
off screen hey marty
marty and clara both look off
ralph is leaning out the car window twisting to look back up the street
yelling hey marty
marty and clara look around to find the source of the voice
marty and clara again look around trying to find ralph
marty spots him leaning out of the window of a chevy parked in the background
yelling hey marty come over here a minute
marty and clara start walking toward the chevy
ralph and mabel a young woman in her early thirties are seated in front
in the rear seat of the car leo is sandwiched in between a miss louise kelly and a miss elaine explaining to girls youll like this guy
this guys a nice guy
confirming ralphs statement oh this guys a nice guy
marty stops and excuses himself from clara to walk slowly toward the chevy
its about five cars down from him
the camera pans with him
ralph is leaning out of the window again watching marty approach
approaching the car hello ralph whats new
looks through the back window recognizes leo hiya leo
indicates with his head that he wishes to hold a whispered conference with marty hey marty come here a minute
marty leans with his elbow on the open front window of the car his head bowed waiting for ralph to speak his piece
he studiously avoids looking at the girls in the car
lowering his voice hey marty we got an odd squirrel here you interested
marty allows his eyes to flicker quickly over the girl in the seat next to ralph
waddaya mean ralph
turning his head toward the rear of the car and raising his voice hey louise i want you to meet marty pilletti
marty thats louise kelly inna back seat there
louise not an unattractive girl by any means is a little surly at the moment
she merely nods at the introduction
what are we going to do just sit around here all night
addressing martys bowed head in a quick mutter listen marty these three squirrels are nurses
were all going over leos house later because theres nobody there
these are the squirrels i told you about
money inna bank man
wanna get inna car
shes a pretty nice looking doll
im with a girl ralph
get ridda her
this is money inna bank
i cant do that ralph because somebody already brushed her off once tonight
this is a good deal here marty
marty straightens looks surreptitiously back to the corner where clara is standing
clara stands alone on the corner
she is an angular awkward plain girl
marty brings his attention back around to ralph who is leaning out of the car window
bending down to ralph i cant do it ralph
looks toward back seat very nice to have met you all
come on lets get outta here
hey ralph we might as well get going
ralph bends forward and starts the car
ill see you leo
ill see you marty
marty takes a step or two back from the car and ralph begins the business of wheeling the car from out of its parking place
the car backs and fills once or twice and eventually clears and whisks into the street
marty stands looking after the departing car then slowly turns and goes back up the sidewalk
he joins clara and we
marty and clara come into the dark house
nobody is home
marty and claras silhouettes block the doorway momentarily
wait a minute
lemme find the light
he finds the lights
the kitchen is suddenly brightly lit
the two of them stand squinting to adjust to the sudden glare
i guess my mother aint home yet
i figure my cousin thomas and virginia musta gone to the movies so they wont get back till one oclock at least
clara advances into the kitchen a little ill at ease and looks around
marty closes the porch door
this is the kitchen
yes i know
come on inna dining room
he turns the light on as he enters
clara follows him into the
siddown take off your coat
you want something to eat
we gotta whole half chicken in the icebox
alighting tentatively on the edge of a chair no thank you
i dont think i should stay very long
just take off your coat a minute
he helps her off with her coat
he remains behind her looking down at her
conscious of his scrutiny she sits uncomfortably breathing unevenly
marty takes her coat into the dark living room
clara is patient but nervous
marty comes back sits on another chair and there is an awkward silence
so i was telling you my kid brother nickie got married last sunday
that was a very nice affair
and they had this statue of some woman and they had whiskey spouting outta her mouth
i never saw anything so grand in my life
the silence again falls between them
and watta meal
im a butcher so i know a good hunka steak when i see one
that was choice filet right off the toppa the chuck
a buck eighty a pound
of course if you wanna cheaper cut get rib steak
that gotta lotta waste on it but it comes to about a buck and a quarter a pound if its trimmed
listen clara make yourself comfortable
youre all tense
oh im fine
you want me to take you home ill take you home
maybe that would be a good idea
hes a little angry
he turns and sullenly goes back to the living room for her coat
wordlessly he begins to help her into the coat
standing behind her he puts his hands on her shoulders then suddenly seizes her and begins kissing her on the neck
as marty holds clara kissing the back of her neck the dialogue drops to quick hushed whispers
no marty please
i like you
i like you
i been telling you all night i like you
i just wanna kiss thats all
he attempts to turn her face toward him
he releases her and turns away violently
ill take you home
he marches a few paces away deeply disturbed
he turns back to her
all i wanted was a lousy kiss
what do you think i was gonna try something serious with my mother coming home any minute
what am i a leper or something
he turns and goes into the living room to hide the flush of hot tears threatening to fill his eyes
clara is also on the verge of tears
more to herself than to him i just didnt feel like it thats all
slowly she moves to the archway leading to the living room
camera angles to include the living room where marty sits on the couch with his hands in his lap staring straight ahead
the room is dark except for the slanted light coming from the dining room
clara goes to the couch and sits on the edge beside him
he doesnt look at her
im old enough to know better
comes new years eve everybody starts arranging parties im the guy they gotta dig up a date for
let me getta packa cigarettes and ill take you home
he starts to rise but instead sinks back onto the couch looking straight ahead
clara looks at him her face peculiarly soft and compassionate
id like to see you again
the reason i didnt let you kiss me was because i just didnt know how to handle the situation
youre the kindest man i ever met
the reason i tell you this is because i want to see you again very much
i know that when you take me home im going to just lie on my bed and think about you
i want very much to see you again
marty stares down at his hands
without looking over at her waddaya doing tomorrow night
ill call you up tomorrow morning
maybe well go see a movie
id like that very much
the reason i cant be definite about it now is my aunt catherine is probably coming over tomorrow and i may have to help out
ill wait for your call
we better get started to your house because the buses only run about one an hour now
ill just get a packa cigarettes
he rises and goes into his bedroom
camera angles to include door to bedroom
marty opens his bureau drawer and extracts a pack of cigarettes
he comes back out and looks at clara for the first time
they start to walk to the dining room
in the archway marty pauses and turns to her
waddaya doing new years eve
they quietly slip into each others arms and kiss
slowly their faces part and martys head sinks down upon her shoulder
he is crying detectable from the slight shake of his shoulders
the girl presses her cheek against the back of his head
the sound of the kitchen door opening splits them out of their embrace
a moment later mrs
pillettis voice is heard
off screen hallo
she comes into the dining room stops at the sight of marty and clara
hello marty when you come home
we just got here about fifteen minutes ago
ma i want you to meet miss clara snyder

pilletti pulls her coat off

turning to clara my sister catherine she dont get along with her daughter in law so shes gonna come live with us
oh shes coming eh ma
to clara siddown siddown
marty tell her siddown
might as well siddown a minute clara
clara smiles and sits
pilletti likewise seats herself holding her coat in her lap
to marty did you offer the young lady some fruit
i offered her ma she dont want nothing
no thank you really mrs
to clara with a sigh its a very sad business i tell you
a woman fifty six years old all her life she had her own home
now shes just an old lady sleeping on her daughter in laws couch
its a curse to be a mother i tell you
your children grow up and then what is left for you to do
what is a mothers life but her children
it is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home
couldnt she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time
what can she do
she cooks and she cleans
you gotta have a house to clean
you gotta have children to cook for
these are the terrible years for a woman the terrible years
you mustnt feel too harshly against her daughter in law
she also wants to have a house to clean and a family to cook for
pilletti darts a quick sharp look at clara
then she looks back to her own hands which are beginning to twist nervously
you dont think my sister catherine should live in her daughter in laws house
well i dont know the people of course but as a rule i dont think a mother in law should live with a young couple
where do you think a mother in law should go
i dont think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life
well maybe thats what they teach you in new york university
in real life it dont work out that way
you wait till you are a mother
its silly of me to argue about it
i dont know the people involved
ma im gonna take her home now
its getting late and the buses only run about one an hour
standing it was very nice meeting you mrs
i hope ill see you again
marty and clara move toward the kitchen
all right ma
ill be back in about an hour an hour anna half
marty and clara go out through the kitchen
camera stays on mrs
pilletti who stands expressionlessly by her chair staring after them
she remains there rigid even after the kitchen door has opened and shut
the biggest intersection in the bronx is near the grand concourse at fordham road which is the biggest boulevard
despite the hour the sidewalks are crowded with people
the traffic is heavy with buses
we pick up angie walking up fordham road just about to the grand concourse
as he reaches the northeast corner of the intersection and stands waiting for the light to change he looks off screen
something captures his attention and he calls out
in front of alexanders department store the street is crowded and a bus queue waits for the downtown concourse bus
marty and clara are part of the queue
starting toward marty and clara shouting hey
angie starts into the street without waiting for the lights to change
impatiently he has to wait until traffic stops for the light
shouting as he goes hey marty
marty and clara still stand seeming not to hear angie
off screen hey marty
marty and clara turn and stare off screen
angie pushes his way through the crowd on the sidewalk and manages to join marty and clara
where you been for pete sakes
i been looking all over for you
i looked for you angie before i cut out but i couldnt find you
i been looking all over for you
angie is absolutely unaware of or simply refuses to acknowledge the presence of the girl
he has pushed himself in between marty and clara and addresses himself entirely to marty
what happened angie was that we thought we were just gonna go for a short walk and then we thought we were gonna come right back but we got to
listen angie i want you to meet clara
he tries to turn the sullen angie toward clara clara this is my best friend angie
i told you about him
how do you do
angie acknowledges the introduction with a surly nod
completely ignoring clara now waddaya gonna do now
im gonna take clara home
its close to one
you want me to ride down with you
it must be one oclock
its saturday night
theres still plenty a action around
angie by the time i get clara home its gonna be one one thirty
by the time i get home its gonna be two oclock
i gotta get up for ten oclock mass tomorrow
angie stares with thick sullen jealousy at his best friend
he turns sharply and starts away from marty and clara
as he goes all right ill see you
calling after him where you going
angie feeling rejected and jealous moves swiftly out into the other pedestrians on fordham road
calling more loudly after him ill see you tomorrow after mass
he stares for a moment at the departing form of his friend then turns to clara with a shrug and a smile as if to say i dont know whats
the matter with him
the long awaited downtown bus roars up to the corner blocking our view of marty and clara
marty and clara stroll along the walk toward the front doors of an apartment house
marty and clara enter and cross the lobby toward the stairway
they move slowly
you got an elevator in this house
we just live one flight up
so ill call you tomorrow
clara leans against the iron banister of the stairway
call me about two thirty because i wont be home from my aunts till about then
the doors of the elevator slide open and a middle aged couple comes out
they have obviously been having a heated exchange but at the sight of marty and the girl at the stairway they become silent
they march across the lobby and out to the street in repressed silence
the door clangs behind them
marty and clara have waited stiffly through this interruption and now they look at each other and smile
okay so ill see you tomorrow night then
marty turns and moves across the lobby toward the street door
marty stands a moment in the clear black night air expressionless but within him a strange exhilaration is beginning to stir
he mosies away from the building along the sidewalk camera panning with him
he strikes out suddenly with a spirited stride as if he knew where he was going
closer shot of marty marching along th street
he quickly reaches the grand concourse
here he pauses a moment a little at a loss for what direction to take then remembers he needs the uptown bus
he moves across the wide street to get to the other side of the boulevard
again he seems to lose track of which direction is homeward
he walks uptown a ways with a strange jerky stride pausing every once in a while to see whether theres a bus coming
suddenly marty breaks into a dog trot then drops back into the stiff stride as he approaches
the corner near the bus stop is deserted
marty stops leans against the pole of the bus stop sign
abruptly he turns and walks uptown a little further
series of intercuts marty strides walks stops short goes to the curb desultorily a few paces into the street moves back
the traffic moves by him
he stands in the wide street then with a gesture of magnificent expansiveness he raises his arm and calls out
close up of marty standing in the street crying
marty is in his trousers and t shirt
he whistles as he assembles his toilet articles for a shave
he starts out toward the living room still whistling
bright sunlight pours through the curtains on his window
martys whistling accompanies him to the second floor where he turns into the bathroom
camera angles to include mrs
pillettis bedroom disclosing her wearing an old faded batiste kimona puttering around her room and cleaning
as martys toneless tune reaches her mrs
pilletti turns her head and stares off listening
catherine in the living room is packing her meager but neatly folded belongings into an old european carpet bag
she has regained her stiff mordant crustiness
the mild wail of a baby can be heard
the crowded bedroom is furnished in white modern
it is cluttered by a babys bassinet and other baby items
virginia sits on the edge of the bed holding the baby quieting it
she is half dressed wearing her pajama top a half slip no stockings her hair is still uncombed
thomas slouches against a chest of drawers in morning semi deshabille
he is obviously sick with guilt
virginia looks anxiously at her husband then to the baby in her arms
heavy whisper dont you think i feel lousy about this too
all right ginnie
i dont wanna talk anymore about it
sits on a wooden chair unrolls a fresh pair of socks hes been holding i dont think i got one hours sleep the whole night
raises one leg to put a sock on pauses with his heel on the edge of his chair last night was the first time in my life i ever heard
my mother cry you know that
snapping i dont wanna talk about it
he pulls his sock on angrily then lets his leg fall back to the floor and just sits one sock on one sock in his hand
he looks sullenly in the direction of his wife
continuing huffy i know what youre gonna say
a mans gotta stop being his mothers baby sooner or later
how many times you gonna say it
shes my mother you know
i oughta have some feelings about her dont you think
why do you always put me inna position of being the louse
in a furious whisper virginia i dont wanna hear no more about it
he stands then becomes aware he has to put on his other sock
he sits down again and pulls the second sock on
virginia has had a hot reply in her mouth but she forces it back
she rocks the baby a little
tommy i love you and i know you feel lousy right now but were never gonna be happy unless we have a chance to work out our own lives
we cant keep talking in whispers like this the resta our lives
we gotta have some privacy
thomas has risen a slim dark unsettled young man in undershirt and trousers holding his shoes in one hand
he starts toward the
thomas strides down the little foyer
he turns and looks into the living room
he watches his mother packing strange brown parcels into her bag
scowling cant you wait five minutes
ill drive you over inna car
i just gotta put my shirt on thats all
the old lady nods brusquely
thomas stands with his head bowed to hide the tears he feels sweeping into his hot eyes
then he returns to his bedroom in his stocking feet carrying his shoes
thomas comes in just as virginia bends over the bassinet having gotten the baby back to sleep
thomas cries to her in a furious whisper
all right get dressed because were gonna drive my mother over
why couldnt you get along with her
why couldnt you make just a little effort
shes a little hard to get along with
all i asked you was try a little
he turns from her sits down on the bed miserably angry with the world his wife his mother himself
the baby begins to whimper again
virginia turns wearily to her husband
roaring out i dont wanna hear anymore about it you hear me
a small procession consisting of thomas carrying his mothers carpet bag his mother carrying small paper wrapped bundles and virginia holding the baby comes across the front hedge
thomas leads the parade with a muffled sorrow
they turn up the porch to the front door
virginia remains in the small front yard
she is miserable
pilletti is dressed in hat and coat and all set to go to mass
she is bent over the dining room table piling the breakfast dishes and crumbing the table
she looks up as thomas comes in carrying his mothers bag
aunt catherine is right behind him
beyond the porch we can see virginia walking the baby around outside
hello aunt theresa
hello thomas how do you feel
setting the bag down ah my mother she drives me crazy
i hadda beg her to let me drive her over here
she always gotta be the big martyr
hey will you go to mass please
this one he woke up this morning with salt in his nose
will you leave me in peace ah
a burst of spirited song soars from upstairs
pilletti aunt catherine and even thomas pause to look up in the direction of the voice
marty descends the stairs whistling
he carries his jacket over his arm
he makes some final adjustments to his tie
alert to martys mood mrs
pilletti aunt catherine and thomas stand waiting for him to join them downstairs
ebulliently hello aunt catherine
how are you

i was at mass two hours ago

the refrigerator is loaded with food

he abruptly goes out into the living room and onto the front porch
to catherine you wanna cuppa coffee
marty has followed thomas out into the living room
boy beautiful day hey thomas

thomas goes out the door onto the porch
marty stands in the open doorway
he looks out into the warm sunshine in the front yard
he goes out into the yard to virginia
he is as gay as a bird
he takes the baby from virginias arms holds it high up above him
to baby hey little boy you sure getting fat

beams at the baby hey thomas so i was telling you yesterday you was over my house mr

thomas hasnt been listening to marty and crosses quickly to virginia

marty comes up to them holding the baby
so thomas he does about twelve thirteen hundred gross
rents a hundred and two
the problem of course is the supermarkets
thats what i wanna ask you

thomas has been trying to listen to marty but his thoughts are all with his own problem
he whirls on virginia
what about the time she wanted to make an old fashioned italian dinner for my brother but you wouldnt let her
with her own temper waddaya talking about
once a month you couldnt let her use the kitchen
i told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted

but patsys shop thats a specialized trade
the supermarkets dont carry italian meat
who buys italian meat anymore
you think my wife buys italian meat
throws a baleful glance at his wife she goes to the a p picks up some lamb chops wrapped in cellophane opens up a canna peas and thats dinner boy
sure all you wanna eat is that greasy stuff your mother makes
marty is a little taken aback by thomass frontal assault
well i understand the problem about the supermarkets but i was talking to this girl last night and she made the point that a likeable personality is a valuable business
marty see that my mother is nice and comfortable eh
this girl said
what girl what does she know
he whirls on his wife again why dont you let her hold the baby once in a while
your mother boy she wantsa take the kid for a day thats fine
her temper flaring again your mother handles the kid like he was a yoyo
marty stands watching the young couple yakking at each other
the little baby starts to cry again
the two old sisters sit at the kitchen table two untouched cups of coffee in front of them
hey i come home from your house last night marty was here with a girl
your son marty
well what marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl
were the lights on
frowns at her sister this girl is a college graduate
theyre the worst
college girls are one step from the streets
they smoke like men inna saloon
my son joseph his wife you know she types onna typewriter
one step from the streets i tell you
pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment
thats the first time marty ever brought a girl to this house
she seems like a nice girl
i think he has a feeling for this girl
you heard him sing
he been singing like that all morning
catherine nods bleakly
well thats all
you will see

catherine you are a blanket of gloom
wherever you are the rain follows
someday you gonna smile and we gonna declare a holiday
marty comes in from the living room a little down after his session with thomas and virginia
hello ma waddaya say its getting a little late
marty goes to the sink to get himself a glass of water
he examines a piece of plaster that has fallen from the ceiling
boy this place is really coming to pieces
turning to his mother you know ma i think we oughta sell this place
the whole joints going to pieces
the plumbing is rusty
im gonna have to replaster the whole ceiling now
you know what we oughta do
we oughta get one of those new apartments theyre building down on southern boulevard
a nicer parta town you know
you all set ma
pilletti exchanges a brief frightened glance with her sister
im all set
she sends another frightened look at her sister and follows marty out into the living room
marty his mother thomas and virginia with the baby file down the porch to the street on their way to church
marty and his mother are both troubled
the anger has left both thomas and virginia but they are both silent
at the far end of the alleyway as they reach the street virginia puts her free arm through her husbands elbow
thomas looks briefly at her and they exchange a look of commiseration
everyone turns and disappears off into the street
a high wide angle shot of the church establishes that stage of sunday morning between the nine and ten oclock masses
people flock around the doors of the church
the parishioners are making their ways to the door
a few silent penitents still kneel here and there in the long empty rows of pews
the large almost empty church is filled now with organ music
both marty and his mother seem a little depressed as they stand at the doorway just inside the church as the nine oclock mass people flow out and the first
of the ten oclock mass people file in
that was a nice girl last night marty
marty nods she wasnt a very good looking girl but she looks like a nice girl
she pauses marty makes no reply i said she wasnt a very good looking girl
not very pretty
still amiable i heard you ma
she looks a little old for you
about thirty five forty years old
shes twenty nine ma
a nearby kneeling penitent looks disapprovingly at mrs
pilletti and shushes her
the mother nods briefly
shes more than twenty nine years old marty
thats what she tells you
she looks thirty five forty
she didnt look italian to me
marty frowns but remains silent
i said is she italian girl
i dont know
i dont think so
pillettis turn to frown
she turns back to marty
she dont look italian to me
what kinda family she come from
there was something about her i didnt like
it seems funny the first time you meet her she comes to your empty house alone
these college girls they all one step fromma streets
marty turns on the verge of anger with his mother
what are you talking about
shes a nice girl
she didnt look italian to me
a silence hangs between them
i dont like her
you dont like her
you only met her for two minutes
dont bring her to the house no more
what didnt you like about her
i dont know
she dont look like italian to me
plenny a nice italian girls around
well lets not get inna fight about it ma
the kneeling woman shushes them again
by now the nine oclock worshipers have filed out and marty joins the flow of ten oclock people moving in
his mother turns back to him again
stopping her before she gets started what are you getting so worked up about
i just met the girl last night
im probably not gonna see her again
they continue down the aisle of the church
an hour later the after mass crowd is there
its a little more crowded than weekdays
a woman with a glass of beer in one hand rocks a baby carriage with the other
marty enters the bar moves along ad libbing hello to someone at the bar gets the attention of lou the bartender
hello lou angie come in yet
he was here last night till about two oclock
i hear you really got stuck with a dog last night
glancing quickly at him who told you that
he says she was a real scrawny looking thing
she wasnt so bad
he turns away from the bar annoyed notes ralph sitting alone in one of the booths reading the sunday comics
marty ambles over to him
howd you make out with those nurses last night ralph
looking up oh man you shoulda come with us last night marty
that one for you was a real lunatic
howd you make out
the abruptness of the question rather startles marty
it is not an expression he would normally associate with an evening with clara
oh i hadda nice time
i didnt try nothing
shes a nice girl
i just met her last night you know
i just talked with her
i didnt even try nothing
he feels very ill at ease and a little guilty for defending himself
listen you see angie tell him i went home ill meet him after lunch
he moves back down the bar and goes out into the street
marty is seated at the dining room table
he has removed his jacket tie and shirt even his shoes and is making himself comfortable over a late sunday lunch
with him are angie and joe the critic
lounging in a chair but not at the table is leo
so the whole book winds up mike hammer hes inna room there with this doll
so he says you rat you are the murderer
so she begins to con him you know
she tells him how she loves him
and then bam
he shoots her in the stomach
so shes laying there gasping for breath and she says how could you do that
and he says it was easy
without looking up from his magazine boy that mickey spillane boy he can write
angie reaches over to martys plate and filches a piece of rissole evidently annoying marty
we gotta whole pot inna kitchen
we give you a plate a your own
oh i couldnt eat nothing
my mother just stuffed me right up to the jaws
this doesnt prevent him from filching a second piece of rissole
what i like about mickey spillane is he knows how to handle women
in one book he picks up a tomato who gets hit with a car and she throws a pass at him
and then he meets two beautiful twins and they throw passes at him
and then he meets some beautiful society leader and she throws a pass at him and
boy that mickey spillane he sure can write
listen somebody turn onna ballgame
it must be after one oclock by now
marty looks down at his watch then stands and starts for the phone sitting on a chest of drawers at the other end of the room
who you gonna call
i was gonna call that girl from last night
take her to a movie tonight
are you kidding
listen angie i wanna tell you you were very impolite last night
i introduced you to the girl you just turned and walked off
now why did you do that
you got me mad thats why
hey joe show marty that picture
joe having finished his dissertation on mickey spillane is now studying another girlie magazine
he proffers an opened page to marty who stands over by the phone
put that away for petes sake
my mothers right out onna porch
i wonder where they find those girls that pose for them pictures
those are hollywood starlets
put it away joe
my motherll come walking in
joe closes the magazine
marty lets go downna seventy second street area tonight
i dont feel like going angie
i thought id take this girl to a movie
boy you really musta made out good last night
we just talked
boy she musta been some talker
she musta been about fifty years old
i always figure a guy oughta marry a girl whos twenny years younger than he is so that when hes forty his wife is a real nice looking doll
that means hed have to marry the girl when she was one year old
i never thoughta that
i didnt think she was so bad looking
she musta kept you inna shadows all night
marty you dont wanna hang around with dogs
it gives you a bad reputation
lets go downa seventy second street
i told this dog i was gonna call her today about two thirty
angry brush her
listen you wanna come with me tonight or you wanna go with this dog
waddaya getting so sore about
i looked all over for you last night you know that
he turns away sulking
marty doesnt pick up the phone but returns to his seat upset
another book that i read by mickey spillane i cant remember the name of it but it was about this red headed tramp he finds inna street and he gives
her some dough because hes sorry for her
wait a minute i think thats the same book i was telling you about before
to angie you didnt like her at all
a real nothing
marty lowers his head
over this joes voice drones on
off screen you know something
camera angle holds on marty looking down as joes voice continues
off screen i cant tell one a those mickey spillane books from the other but hes a real good writer though
close on television screen
ed sullivan is on indicating the time is a little after half past seven
camera pulls back disclosing clara mr
snyder in their living room
apparently the sullivan show is very funny at the moment for the television audience roars with laughter
camera moves in close on clara
another roar of laughter from the television that clara watches although her eyes are flooded with tears several of which have already traced wet paths down her cheeks
another roar of laughter
pilletti and catherine are eating silently at the table
catherine reads an italian newspaper as she eats
so what are you gonna do tonight marty
i dont know ma
im all knocked out
i think ill just hang arounna house and watch
suddenly he pauses sharply aware of the repetition in his life
pilletti is also aware of it
maybe ill go out and see what angie and the boys are doing
they eat silently a moment
close up of marty leaning against the wall in front of the bar
a group of young men lounge about killing time
angie leo and joe are among them
there are perhaps four or five other young men loosely divided into two groups
the group that concerns us has marty and the others mentioned and george a young man in a sport jacket
what time is it
about eight oclock
to george you dont feel like going downna seventy second street

were sure to wind up with something
close up of marty his head down his eyes closed
the group continues their dialogue back and forth
their voices can be heard as martys head slowly comes up
off screen ill never forgive laguardia for cutting out burlesque outta new york city
off screen theres a burlesque in union city
lets go over to union city
off screen yeah youre the one who dont even wanna take a ride onna subway for half an hour

a fury rises in martys face
he cries out at them

camera angles over to the others who at this outburst stare at marty astounded
continuing the burlesque
miserable and lonely
miserable and lonely and stupid
what am i crazy or something
i got something good here
what am i hanging around with you guys for
he has said this in tones so loud that it attracts the attention of the few people on the street
a little embarrassed by the attention hes getting he turns opens the door to the bar and goes into it
after a stunned moment angie hurries after him
marty marches the length of the room toward the phone booths in the rear
camera angles to disclose angie right behind him
marty is about to enter one of the phone booths but he stops as angie hurries up to him
watsa matter with you
marty pauses one foot in the booth
you dont like her
my mother dont like her
shes a dog and im a fat ugly little man
all i know is i hadda good time last night
im gonna have a good time tonight
if we have enough good times together im gonna go down on my knees and beg that girl to marry me
if we make a party again this new years i gotta date for the party
you dont like her thats too bad
marty has been fishing in his pocket for his address book
he opens it to its proper page and steps decisively into the phone booth
nearby angie prowls around outside the booth
the booth door is open
marty starts to dial
a hush fills the room except for the clicking of the telephone dial
the look of fury has drained from martys face
he holds the receiver to his ear glances out toward angie
camera angles to include angie
his old amiable self when you gonna get married angie
arent you ashamed of yourself
youre thirty three years old
all your kid brothers are married
you oughta be ashamed of yourself
still smiling at his very private joke marty returns to the phone and after a fraction of a second
as angie looks miserable and marty slowly reaches out and pushes the phone booth door shut and continues to talk into the phone we very slowly
