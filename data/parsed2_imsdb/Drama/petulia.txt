written by larry marcus march the story begins in this grubby alley where two extra large ambulances screech to a stop beside a loading platform
onlookers gather in the alley entrance to see how many people died nobody died the backdoors of the ambulances are opened by attendants and six perfectly fine victims of perfectly
terrible automobile accidents are lifted into wheelchairs
the cripples are beautifully dressed the men in tuxedos the women in splendid evening dresses
one of the women wears a neck brace which forces her always to look skyward so she cantt see the beautiful orchid corsage pinned to her bosom
quickly attendants roll the wheelchairs past all the stacks of fruit and vegetables on the loading platform past great bales of laundry past whatever horrors one finds behind the warm
smiling face of a hotel
watch men pastry cooks valets are watching the rush of the wheelchairs without much interest
then doors swing open and we are in the tram it of the grand ballroom
it is a charity ball
the sign says shake for highway safety
the wheelchairs and their occupants no longer interest us
they are the guests of honor and people gather about them to arrange them appealingly and we rush past the go go band the shakers and the door prize which
is a little convertible spinning endlessly on a pedestal
camera reaches petulia who is dancing with her husband david but trying not to lose sight of archie
archie really wants to leave but he is too polite to make it too obvious
as he bends over to put his punch cup on a table he is bumped by the wheelchair of one of the guests of honor
he is not at all comfortable
its not easy for petulia to keep an eye on archie gasping faces get in the ways hunks of twisting bodies get in the way and the dance wont end
the music stops for a second everyone sags and thinks thank god its over but instantly the music begins again and everyone good naturedly swears those crazy kids are trying
to kill us and meanwhile petulia sees that archie has reached the place where you get your coat
he is searching through his pockets for the ticket that will let him reclaim his coat
all the coats are in an incredible piles and in the semi hysterical care of a debutante attendant
you cant leave he turns and sees petulia
youre an official host
she nods to the ribbon and cardboard which along with official host says dr
archie takes the ribbon off as though to pin it on petulia
can you tell im not wearing a brassiere
dont think about it
it will only excite you
archie finally finds the ticket for his coat which the attendant now tries to find
on through this petulia continues
thats my husband over there ahh
ive been married six months and ive never had an affair it can happen dont take it so bloody well
ive just turned you down
hes looking at us
my husband somewhere near the free whiskey table asking for pernod which of course they dont have
the father is watching the charity affair with utter disapproval
he tips a waiter by shoving a half dozen raffle tickets into the waiters jacket pocket i hope you win the car sir mrs
danner is charmed by her husbands generosity
she simply adores the man
david is busy not watching archie and petulia isnt he gorgeous
hes a naval architect
it really zings when you say it
my husband david is a naval architect
actually were starving
you wouldnt want to buy a sixty foot sloop
davids momma and poppa keep us
look how disgusted poppa is
he hates this sort of thing
poppa is too sensitive
sensitive my ass
highway safetys so blah
also he hates amateurs
give him something he can sink his teeth into rheumatoid arthritis a muscular dystrophy m and hes the best there is
a real pro
a little lame girl with a ribbon in her hair and a crutch under her arm and poppa can set the world on fire
hes really slumming tonight
have been joined by barney and wilma archies best friends
barney and wilma are taking off their coats
barney is already beginning to move to the music
wilma is doing absolutely nothing but looking at petulia
everybody came late
i came early
could you describe the coat
barney has begun to snap his fingers and move his shoulders becoming part of the scene about which wilma couldnt care less
you cant go archie
id be very archie accepts this silently alright then
i wont tell you who i bumped into last week buying a well larded rib roast
have you seen what shes done to her hair
i said polo for heavens sake you look like a teenager
archie doesnt seem too interested and besides all this is said while wilma continues to look at petulia
your mikes getting so fat
is that much weight good for a boy his age
if its alright for a rib roast smarty
barney suddenly forgets the music to rescue his vicuna coat which the debutante is smothering under other coats as she finally finds archies
to petulia i dont believe weve met
screw you wilma
now youve met
wilma moves off with barney
archie cant spend one more second with his coat
he simply puts it on and turns to leave walking toward the door
my name is petulia itm not surprised polos your wife ex wife g night
petulia turns to face her husband david who has taken a few steps toward her
she whirls around to face the departing archie
he turns almost at the door
say something warm
i mean it there is something goofily desperate in her voice that stops him
he looks at her for awhile
your hair it gleams
left arm or right
how do you brush it
an hour a day
you have a problem
the bursa sheath
very sensitive bursitis
ill come to you
i wouldnt be able to help much
thank you archie
damn it how can i have an affair with an unmarried man
there has to be some equality of guilt
my divorce doesnt become final till next month
ill get my purse
but in turning to do so she sees david then the spinning car the door prize
ive been told that ill be the one to draw the winning ticket
im always picked for things like that
i radiate incorruptibility
money cant buy me
she shakes her head thoughtfully
during all this the door man has been busily opening and closing the door for them as they keep changing their mind
it feels so super
suddenly all that love
all we see is the wheel of a car resting on the back of a small boy pinning him to the ground and people shocked not knowing what to do
well stay then
archie why do you play this dumb game
this crappy pretense at resisting the beautiful lady
youre bloody lucky im even talking to you
how many kids do you have besides fat mike
actually only one besides mike
meet you outside
a motel sign dream motel
a concrete oval spiral ling up four floors
you drive to your room and everything is geared to get you to bed electronically
but you must have a car and petulia and archie have come by cab
archie is paying the cabbie
to cabbie you mustnt take it personal
she indicates the no cabs sign lucky we dont have luggage
does this trouble you
i suggested my place
id always imagined a tourist cabin with paper thin walls the sounds of a man from tennessee in the cabin next door sobbing endlessly m ude maude maude archie sees
a car moving through the processes of e registration
grabbing petulias hand he starts to what is presumably the entrance at least it is the bottom of the ramp
they arrive at the booth and archie steps on the
place marked stand here
screen lights up
wheres your auto
archie nods for petulia to see the t
camera which is scanning them
lost in a hailstorm this side of pocatello idaho
those hailstones really came down didnt they zeke
its a problem
only if we make it one
do you have any slides or swings for children
you got kids
i was told to be suspicious of motels which cater to the family trade
this isnt that sort of place
there is a small sound and a gadget reaches out which normally would fasten to the side of the car
on it is an electronic register an electronic pen and a key with a great metal tag as an example of how this might be designed i recommend visiting a
drive in bank in los angeles
as archie registers and puts the ten dollar bill where it belongs petulia looks at the t
s continued youve got a very nice t v face
thank you ma amp you have to use pancake make up things like that
a slight giggle no just be natural
archie has finished registering and takes the keys
weve got an elevator but its just for going out for the paper and the like
i mean when you dont want to take the car
youll have to use the ramp because of the key
it lets you know when you get to your room
archie and petulia start up ramp
its a long dark run and they are soon winded it shouldnt be charming
youre missing the whole point
it should be menacing
another couple in a proper car rushes by
there is a blaze of headlights and a rush of sound
terribly distraught headlights of passing cars lighting up our room
archie tugs at her and gasps
a police car careening down the highway sirens going full blast
and i plunge madly into your arms but she is now totally winded and cannot say another word
archie reacts to a sudden phenomena a tiny light on the key in his hand starts flicking on and off furiously
just ahead of him is the door of their motel room
archie is aghast at the pulsating key
my apartments only four blocks from stark is hardly the word but it will have to do
a control panel takes care of the drapes t
stereo announcements from the office etc
there are mirrors everywhere and the first thing petulia does is establish contact between the vanity mirror the mirror on the bathroom door and the medicine cabinet mirror so that
she is reflected endlessly
you have women in this room and im still counting
archie moves behind her and begins unbuttoning the top buttons on the back of her dress
just wait a minute okay
archie plops on the bed in his coat a most iropic smile on his face he is beginning to suspect he is not going to get laid
petulia is examining all the petulia faces in the mirrors
my great grandmother is ninety one and still has a granite chin
archie pushes a gadget beside the bed and it begins to vibrate
petulia sees endless archies vibrating on endless beds
what a lecherous lot shes ninety ones eh
but no fun
not at ninety one hell she stopped having fun at twenty eight when her husband was killed in the first war in a trench looking just like cary grant with
a waxed moustache
she cant remember him but she does remember cary grant because he is from bristol too and often in the news
if his picture is in the paper he gets a waxed moustache whether he likes it or not
she turns to face archie
she is afraid and she is angry and she doesn t know quite what to do from one moment to the next
but she knows he shouldnt be in an overcoat jiggling on a jiggling bed stop being so damn casual
archie sits up but is still casual were about i td become lovers did you bring an instrument archie
ring for room service
ask the robot for something splendid and musical saxophone
absolutely bless you ar hie a tuba something large and twirly and pom to pom
pomx archie this is an event
we are about to become lovers
you said that
it cant be said often enough
are we what
about to become lovers
ah you swinging young marrieds
across from the ramp there is the elevator the man on t
archie is already there waiting for it to arrive
petulia starts toward him angrily
where do you have to rush
if we were making love you would be exploring my navel about now
time would be the last thing on your mind
an old man in a bathrobe sadly out of contrast with the electronic motel looks up from the open trunk of his car
the elevator doors open
petulia and archie enter the elevator doors shut and inside the elevator a loud speaker begins playing a medley of san francisco songs
look like a gargoyle
poor dumb archie
im all mixed up sexually
old mums a prostitute
the oldest professional lady in all bristol
mavis too my sister
but i mean shes not a landmark yet
during this archie notices that the back of petulias dress remains unbuttoned
he moves behind her and begins rebuttoning her
at the touch of his hand something happens to petulia
archies hands are holding a little boy under the bright lights of a first aid table
the boy is a bloody mess but archies hands are soothing him even as they so gently prod examining his injuries
nurses are cutting the boys bloody jeans off him an expensive watch falls to the floor they retrieve it
petulias head presses against archies hand
she kisses it she rubs her cheek against it
the elevator has come to a stop and the doors have opened
archie sees petulias tears on his hand
real honest to god tears petulia
petulia youre a kook
he exits the elevator and whistles at a cruising cab
archie crosses to the cab and opens the door
he hustles petulia inside the cab
if he gets you there in time you can still pick the winning ticket and make somebody happy
very quietly archie im going to marry you
the cab pulls away and archie sees petulia looking at him through the rear window
archie allows himself the drollest of smiles
its the pepsi generation he walks into the night alone
e continued a jalopy full of dizzy dames with love painted in huge awkward letters on its side almost runs him down
archie continues in the night
now we can see the golden gate bridge
the house is on the edge of the sea and a cliff rises behind it
petulia is going up the open lift which climbs the cliff
it is a very different petulia
archie is sleeping
there is the sound of a bell ringing
after awhile archies hand reaches out for the phone
into phone im up thanks
then his dizzy brain realizes the ringing is continuing and is constant
he sees the alarm clock he stumbles and staggers to the front door
yeah yeah he opens the door to come face to face with the large and twirly front end of a tuba
the tuba is stark white for no particular reason
we see some of the hall a yawning milkman etc
but mostly petulia and the tuba
archie steps back to make room for petulia and the tuba
ill make some coffee
petulia blows with all her strength emitting a sad little peep then collapses to the floor tuba and all
b continued arent i a kook
if you think youre at the same time no ive been up for hours waiting for the doorbell to ring think how surprised the man who owns the pawnshop is
going to be when he sees all that broken glass
a brick smashes the glass scattering cameras mandolins etc
in the midst of which is the white tuba
archie how come the burglar alarm didnt go off
the scene continues
wherets it all going to end if the burglar alarms wont go off
take me to bed archie get the hell out of here
he reaches to help petulia to her feet but as he touches her waist to lift her she screams and faints but we dont know its the danner house
all we see is petulia crumpling as she is struck
she hits the floor and just lies there not making a sound
also shoot in slow motion
archie breaks an ammonia ampule under petulias nose
her head wrenches away and she opens her eyes
archie has begun to prod her side she is in pain
ive got a broken rib i think i can feel it broken archie
dont you know you can puncture a lunge hopping around with tubas and stuff isntt it kooky though
archie has begun to remove her dress
when are we going to stop trying to undress me
leave me alone archie
archie sees she really means it its just a rib to me thats why
call a proper doctor what do you think i am
a hairy legged old lecher running around in pajama bottoms get your clothes off as a woman not as a rib
archie is harassed
the phone begins ringing
he grabs it angrily
into phone im awake
im awake how many times are you gonna call
i he hangs up then realizes this was the first wake up call
to petulia you know what a youll drive me cuckoo
and begins dialing a number
petulia is in real pain
like a little child she crawls under the covers of his bed pulling the quilt up around her as though archies left over warmth will make the pain go away
into phone barney
fine fine fine i want you to look at a patient for me
at my place
my apartment barney its very complicated and i havent had my morning coffee yet
her name is petulia
i dont know her last name barney
barney shut up
i have to get to the hospital
during the above we catch a glimpse of sleepy barney sleepily asking stupid questions
archie hangs up goes to a medicine case which he had hastily opened for the ammonia ampule and now he takes out a couple of pills which he gives to
she takes them obediently youve got a super build for a man your age
archie says nothing
he crosses to the bathroom and hastily begins dressing
where are all the family pictures
archie is busy brushing his teeth the family pictures
he looks out from the bathroom blankly polo and the boys
archie goes back to brushing his teeth electrically with salt
b continued a petulia ill bet you named her polo
dont ever start mucking about with petulia
archie exits from the bathroom all the time continuing to dress whatas her real name
and you named her polo
thats kind of sickening archie
archie stops his dressing long enough to gaze at this girl in his bed beyond which is an overturned tuba
archie sighs somewhat philosophically not nearly as amused as youd think
we are in the examining room of the orthopedic ward
archie is working on oliver the little mexican boy of seven whom we have seen earlier as a bloody mess in the flashback
now oliver is healing nicely but its still not pleasant to be examined
a woman hovers in the back ground
a nurse assists archie
oliver is a brave solemn little boy with shadows of fatigue around his eyes
he is also a tough little bastard let me tell you
he is now wearing the broken gold watch though to fit his skinny wrist the band has been tied in a knot i want him here every day
si yes doctor
i do oliver speaks only a few words of english mostly the necessary scatological and sexual phrases that would be necessary in his line of business
tell him that
the woman says it to oliver in spanish
oliver says something obviously obscene
whatd he say
he say yes
dubiously to woman you sure
to oliver otherwise we keep you in the hospital
youre not well just better
to woman say that
the woman tells oliver in spanish as archie continues examining the leg
oliver says something in spanish
smiling a bit where he learn such words shame on you
then in spanish shame
archie realizes oliver is in great pain and close to tears
he stops the examination and rubs his hand gently through the kids hair every day
two oclock right on the dot
he hits watch on wrist
the last bit of glass falls out
sorry oliver swears in spanish and the woman clacks her tongue
i like the way he heals
archie smiles and leaves
the nurse is left with oliver who avoids her touch cut that out you little spit archie stops to hear what the woman has to say
about the bill doctor
barney is passing by
is she okay
archie looks up at the woman
a archie his leg will be fine
dont worry too much about the bill
just enough to pay it
i have money to pay it a pipe smoking public relations man leads a casually dressed group past archie and the woman
yea we had abc filming a documentary here last week all through the scene barney and archie will be served by topless waitresses while other topless waitresses slide down a
big brass pole in the centre of the room
as the scene begins barney is alone morosely munching a corned beef sandwich
now archie appears threading his way through topless fashion show
a topless announcer is doing the fashion commentary into a chrome microphone as the topless models majestically move about
no fashion cliche untouched springtime in paree
our elegante dinner pajamas
in airy aquamarine chiffon and mediterranean blue peau de soie
delightfully carefree yet formal enough for an ambassadorial reception at the palace of versailles
screw you wilma
why didnt you tell me
how is she
you tell me
oh great terrific you wouldnt believe it
and her rib
i taped it
gave her some seconal
a should have a vertical just to be safe
a waitress hovers why do we have to eat topless
the best irish stew in town
he is eating a corned beef sandwich
archie is ordering the same
she said you beat her up
kidding of course
archie bites into his sandwich with small enthusiasm
breasts with their pasties always intrude
you must have been a little rough on her daddy
the second model a beautiful topless negress is now wandering past the tables
the announcer goes on and on
opening night at the opera
though the curtain has risen on the first act of aida all eyes are on the royal box mi lady in dazzling velvet cardinal richelieu rouge
the utter simplicity of her full length gown is subtly accented by the merest suggestion of gay abandon
archie eats his sandwich
an off duty topless waitress sits in the corner having lunch holding a napkin over her bosom with one hand while eating with the other
you know how long ive known you
thats how long
and polo and the kids
thats exactly how long
archie is watching the brass pole
every other girl sliding down looks like petulia
archie accepts his hallucination with mild pleasure
barney will not be stopped
so i have a right to my opinion its breaking wilmas heart thats all we talk about
you think youre different than anybody else
every time i leave my house its the last time im never coming back
youre not listening to me archie
barney for chrissake im listening to you youre thinking about that hot cat in your bed you bastard
now in the continuous luncheon fashion show the psychedelic yvonne has appeared topless amid a wild pattern of lights the dialogue between barney and archie continues elsewhere as the orgy
of colors becomes the left side of a patients face and the right shoulder and arm of the patients body are sprayed with a special liquid which instantly dries a violent blue and then very quickly starts changing into all the colors of the rainbow
these various colors indicate physical conditions
they are watched measured and timed by archie barney and their assistants my record is far from spotless if you dont know that who does
but baby its just not the answer not at our age
so whats the answer baby
a someplace you can belch without saying excuse me
i can do that in the steam room at the ymca
going right on and if a little monkey business comes along whose gonna throw rocks
you and polo were a marvellous looking couple
the patient is in a lead room being scanned by an atomic computer
the activator moves in a rhythmic graceful pattern over the patients drab withered body
in the control area archie and barney listen to the strange sounds emanating from the computer each sound again indicating a physical condition
the patients room looks like a comfy hotel room wood paneling couches magazines plants
the door leading to outside is three inches thick and solid lead
the noise from the equipment is deafening
is there something wrong with being a groovy looking couple
people turning around to stare
what was it archie
the sex bit
the ole sex bit
barney what would you say if i told you that one day i just got very tired of being married
this is a really glorified pressure chamber where a complete atmosphere is created to suit whatever surgery is going on
the patient can no longer be seen
he is draped in plastic which creates a sub atmosphere
the doctors and nurses are swathed in plastic again in the atmosphere that lets them function best this is for real
it exists for instance at mt
sinai hospital in new york
the doctors and nurses communicate with each other through throat mikes and seem like other world automatons
in all this the patient simply does not exist
the colors are eerie yellows and blues with only occasionally and very impersonally the red of blood he never listens its still better than being out there in the dark
all by your goddam lonesome
nobody has a life anymore
quicksand it scares me
what do you want archie
archie and barney are in a white cubicle playing handball
their dialogue of course continues i dont know what i want
to feel something thats no answer archie grow up
the ball comes whizzing at barney who suddenly wants it to hit him which it does archie what am i going to do about wilma
archie has just parked his car and is going toward the entrance when he sees petulia sitting on a bus stop bench the tuba beside her
she is dozing
she opens her eyes smiles
its the stuff barney gave you
ill drive you home
thank you ill take the bus
dont be silly
dont pry archie
howm i prying
ill go home by bus
if i were prying i would ask you how you broke your rib
you fall on a tuba and you break your rib
the rib was broken hours before your fall
l during this the bus comes to a stop
petulia rises shakily to board it but she cant go through the entrance with the tuba
anytime youre ready lady
ill keep it for you
it has to be returned
friends of the evergreen archie looks blank
its a lodge
ask for mr
the bus driver really leans on his horn to make everything charming
shouting above horn petulia take a cab
shouting above horn dont pry archie she groggily enters the bus leaving the tuba in archies arms
petulia takes a seat at an open window
the bus is now stopped for a moment more by the traffic light
petulia under the best of circumstances doesnt make much sense and now shes quite groggy
will you remember that
friends of the evergreen
petulia where are you going
tell him im sorry i goofed
archie you know something
the tuba makes you look ten years younger and youknow
thingy the bus starts with a jolt and petulia winces in pain
petulia is wincing with pain as she puts groceries on the shelf
david is watching her concerned
just before im fine
for a split second there ism okay
i thought maybe you david
somehow or other we begin to sense that madness has entered what is really a commonplace scene
something has gone wrong and we cant for the life of us under stand what and before we can even guess we are petulia is still in the bus and
we realize she has imagined the foregoing
she gets off the bus
the sign on the door identifies this as a fraternal organization founded in for the betterment of man but the door is securely padlocked for the night
archie stands there holding the tuba and feeling stupid
haplessly he returns to his car and begins stowing the tuba inside banging it against his nose in the process
he is a far from happy man
petulia is filling the noisy old electric ice box with milk ice cream and fresh fruit
a man enters from another room
he is a big sleepy eyed mexican
he has just awakened is wearing his pajama bottoms and is hairy sweaty and fat
petulia obviously knows tlleiman nods hello to which the man answers a non committal grunt
he squeezes past petulia to drink from the sink
he sticks his head under the tap
she speaks slowly because he doesnt understand english i came by to make sure there was enough milk and things
he finds the situation amusing reaching in past petulia to grab an orange
there should be a feeling of a possible relationship between petulia and this man
in the next room a screen door opens and closes
petulia closes the ice box door and we and she see oliver and the woman standing in the doorway
archie is doing research at a desk
working from notes he is talking into a tape recorder about new techniques in the treatment of arthritis that would not require surgery
this is a moment to glimpse archie as a thoughtful man
there are a couple of beer bottles nearby
the bed is still unmade
the tuba stands in the corner
the front doorbell rings and archie crosses over to let in his wife polo a very attractive young matron
polo looks about the apartment dubiously from tuba to unmade bed
she cant keep her eyes off the unmade bed
after awhile hi polo
its very nice
archie looks at her questioningly
ive never been here before
its very nice
its strange coming into your husbands bachelor apartment for the first time
feels slightly illegal
is that a tuba
thats a tuba
make a marvelous lamp
you just had to say it
has a certain zing
howre the kids
looking forward to the weekend
lest i forget she opens her large handbag takes out a cellophane bag of cookies
as usual i baked enough for an army
this is very strange
i didntt think id feel like this
archies sad too therefore he is more brusque than necessary
also he is bugged by the cookies
you need anything polo
well yes and no
i think that covers all the possibilities
polo laughs suddenly they share a moment of warmth
its such a puzzle
we really got on so marvelously
never screamed at each other
a something in his silence plus that damned unmade bed is beginning to make her angry
everybody we knew envied us
we were a handsome couple
this makes her so angry she can now say what she came to say
i think ive fallen in love
the man is warren smith
hes an engineer and very good with the children but he wants to go back to school and get his masters in hydraulics
very long pause well say something
i think thats fine polo
a polo go to hell
tie phone begins ringing
archie crosses to it
no answer hello
were going tobe married
into phone hello
david is on the phone and petuliahas just entered
david hangs up the phone
a david she stops
she waits for a moment wondering if the scene she imagined on the bus is now going to occur
will david now say just for a second there
come on lets eat
morrie finally got a shipment of dungeness crab
well poor guy
they had all that trouble
david crosses to the dining area
and thats that
not right away
hes also divorced
child support it looks absolutely obscene
a continued archie sees her
looking at his bed
so the kids like him eh
how about that
dont you have maid service
what the hell are you doing bringing me cookies
he flings the bag at her barely missing her
they are both stunned by this outburst a shakily well
this is a new side of your natured for two people who never fight absently polo sags down on the edge of the unmade bed which has so fascinated her
during the following no matter what their bodies happen to be doing polo and archie continue to speak in a most logical manner
whats so great about not fighting
i came to tell you about warren you told me about warren
he sits beside her well not really beside her actually as far away from her as the bed will permit
she decides she will instantly get up off the bed but she does not
warren is working for his mtstahs in hydraulics
polo knows she shouldnt smile at archie making fun of warren but she does
archie touches her smile with his finger then his hand moves across her face to the back of her neck
it is a clumsy gesture and they clumsily sprawl on the bed
well im afraid well still need all the money you pay me
and ill be seeing him archie its a nice enough room which makes what she says later quite absurd she and warren are preparing for bed am already in a
boring ritualistic fashion she with curlers in her hair he hanging his trousers on a hanger continuing at the house
i mean until warren and i get married which wont be by now entirely out of habit archies hand has pushed up polos shirt as he continues the sex ritual
wholly out of habit polo lets him
their bodies old friends for so long and once having been lovers simply ignore whatever tripe their mouths happen to be saying until he is established with some hydraulics firma
i hope it wont be too long i mean for everybodys sake
if hes a bright guy hell make out okay
needless to say there are certain problems
by now archie is on top of polo and out of habit she is adjusting her body for him
b continued he lives in such a depressing rented room
it gives me claustrophobia
its such an icky little room
archie is perhaps two seconds away from entering polo when he suddenly sits up wondering what the hell hes been doing
he walks to the far side of the room sticks his shirt in wipes the sleeve of his shirt across his face
polo feels no particular rancor the entire thing was totally unplanned and she has no more desire to make it with archie than he has with her
she pulls down her skirt and adjusts her garters
tell the kids ill come for them sunday at eight
theyll be ready
i thought the decent thing was to come here and talk in a civilized manner
about the change in my situation
i appreciate it polo
good night archie
youve got a run in your stocking
polo exits archie cant figure out why in the world he even thought of making love to polo after all this time
he sits down on the unmade bed finds one of polos cookies on the sheets and pops it into his mouth
its a busy saturday and everything is lovely
a large guard with a bull horn is keeping people moving on the japanese bridge
many soldiers on pass a few hippies but mostly just tourists
with bull horn now you folks keep moving along that bridge
you keep moving along and give other folks a chance
theres lots of pretty things to do
you keep moving right along
you wont want to forget our niponese souvenir pagoda where every item is the real mccoy
keep moving thats the ticket
sergeant youve been standing there some time now
during this may and archie talk
s and pretty
its a nice day but archie is not happy
polo warren maybe petulia mostly its kind of a lousy day to be a bachelor
and may have been sitting on the grass
gracefully she rises to her feet doing everything just right even this
she puts away her portable martini kit
nobody in the world can sit on the grass and not wrinkle
not even a blade of grass
why dont i marry you may
why dont you ar hie
they walk along holding hands
archie should feel better than he does
tell me about bobby kennedy
she looks at him smiling
she smiles tolerantly as they walk along
a continued choose a subject
any damn thing
take either side
talk for thirty seconds against ice cubes
why the hostility archie
that dress shop of yours
ive never seen one of those
your rubber mannequins
ive never once seen the pipe sticking out of their bottoms
not once not one damn time
that bothers me may
she doesn t know whether to be annoyed or amused
shets a little of both
im not hostile its frustration
in all that perfection how could a clumsy clot like me possibly be fitted in
i mean without spoiling the whole effect
they have now reached the area of the stunted trees
nuns are passing through empty benches kids are improvising on the stage and shouting
dont worry about it
youll be going back to polo
no shes found a fellah
she watches the kids for a moment
id just about given up on you what i should do is marry you
for may this has been said once too often
she is now thoroughly annoyed
archie if it would please you ill submit a list of my faults some of which might shake you up a bit
it would be a fake list
probably it wouldnt be a fake list
actually i wear arch supports my depilatory causes a nasty little rash and ive lost of my hearing in less than a year
they laugh kiss grab at each other and hurry toward the parking lot for archies car
petulia waits on the steps
when she is not being observed when she is not on there are moments when petulia seems utterly forlorn
this is such a moment
but then she sees archie and may and instantly she is with it
well of all people
all that crap about the humanitarian ism of the medical profession
she darts alongside the building and begins frantically calling to a little old man in white duck pants and an aloha hat may looks at archie questioningly
petulia and the old man are back joining archie and may on the steps
archie this is mr
i was looking at the foundation
once in a while you find one from before the earthquake
its a thrill believe you me
continued petulia resents any sense of cordiality at this particular time
howard is thewatchman for the friends of the evergreen
no wonder people are becoming cynical about doctors
i tried to return it
the place was locked
no harm done a i didnt expect this of you archie
i tried to return the tuba friday its o
accusingly to the friends of the evergreen are very proud of their brass band
alls well that ends well
stay out of this mr
she sees may watching all this with wry amusement
im petulia danner
im sorry about this
howard is casually testing the valves on the tuba
she said there was this elderly lady whose first husband used to play tuba with john phillip sousa
she said it would cheer her up and make her want to live
she gave me five bucks
looking at petulia all that broken glass finished with the tuba its okay
archie crosses to the front door and opens it
petulia crosses to mr
howard and presses a dollar bill into his shirt pocket
take a taxi
you can at least say youre sorry archie
im sorry mr howard
but petulia just sits on the edge of a chair tapping her fingers in annoyance
the door remains open for petulia to leave
may watches petulia in amused tolerance
whats the next move petulia
id like to discuss your irresponsibility
people are passing in the hallway peering in
he advances on her somewhat threateningly
archie slams the door shut ets a bottle and a couple g of glasses pointedly exclu ding petulia
i should explain about petuliaa she is a kook
we are going to be married
archie when you try to sound cool and with it youre really pathetic
were trying to have an intelligent conversation
well about polo among other things
polo is none of your damned business
shes my business and shes this ladys business
i happen to hate polo
to may needless to say shes never even met polo
i look at you and i know polo
to map explain that to him
may looks at archie in bewilderment she is not quite sure how to react but when she makes up her mind it will be the exactly right reaction
also in all truth petulia is frightened by may
how many years were you married
anyhow the best wasted
gone down the drain
oh come on
o archie we are from two different worlds
weve got nothing to agree on
except one thing
youre a lonely screwed up mess
archie im trying to save you
youre a very special man
tell him may
petulia doesnt like mays amused reaction
you dont think so
i wont put archie on a pedestal
youve got yourself another winner archie
to archie its a joke youre both putting me on
i mean it
all this e i love lucy jazz
its only cute for awhile
its not meant to be cute
im fighting for your life
whos trying to kill me
the two million five hundred thousand subscribers to the ladies home journal right dear
petulia go home and save whats his name
i really dont want to see you anymore
archies voice is cold
petulia is suddenly defeated mostly by may
she gets up and leaves
its after a
and archie is hollow eyed and drenched with sweat from an emergency operation
he is with a patient in the recovery room obviously concerned about i continued the patients chances
he crosses to a sink bathes his face and hands with cold water
he is exhausted
as we sometimes glimpse petulia when no one else is looking and see beyond the kookiness so for an instant we see beyond archies look of professional assurance and see
the fearful uncertainty
he now moves into the corridor with each step assuming the doctors look that is expected of him
petulia is in the medical library with books scattered all about her
i think ive discovered a cure for cancer
well if youre on the brink of something
how did they let you in
she joins him
you look exhausted
do you know its almost three
danner worry at all about things like that
petulia looks at him reverently
look at you
archie is so unaccustomed to hearing a straight line from petulia that her tone and look of tenderness stop him for a moment
then without a word they fall into step beside each other leaving the hospital
at this time of night hardly a car remains
archies car is quite by itself
shall i drop you off
she doesnt answer its too late for the bus
she gets in
petulia youve got to stop following me around like this
petulia is absolutely silent but her eyes are devouring him with infinite tenderness which archie is finding very touching
it is a facet of petulia he has never seen before
i could use a steak sandwich
theres a jazz joint that stays open all night
he reaches to start the car just as she grabs at him a awkwardly aggressively
hey come on am why this sudden petulia is relentless and voracious
her hands and mouth are everywhere on archie
a car is a lousy bedroom but it will have to do
heads bump against windows elbows jam against steering wheels but petulia will not be stopped
finally archie grips her shoulders and forces her to stop
though the streets outside are deserted the supermarket is jammed with people
archie is pushing a market a basket already piled high with groceries while petulia keeps finding things to buy
archie knows that petulia is going through this massive shopping spree simply to get even for his rejection of the moment she chose to make love
a continued it m not really hungry
am i being punished
well have a case
id rather have a new plastic raincoat
you dont save anything on plastic raincoats
shall i get another cart
polo can fill three or four when she really puts her mind to it
petulia gets the point and instantly takes her place in the long line before the cashier
as if its petulias fault you know what time it is
its after fivb
i want to go to bed
so do we
petulia and archie leave the supermarket with their rolling basket of groceries
there is no one else on the street
in front of the market is a clown on a pedestal gesticu lating with arms and mouth at people who are not there but making no sound
petulia quizzically looks up at the silent violent clown while archie waits for her at the car
finally he taps the horn and she turns and looks at him
she starts running toward the car suddenly wanting very much to be with him
they kiss lightly
archie is sound asleep breathing heavily
petulia sits wrapped in a blanket on the floor near the window her head resting on the sill lonely
petulia is sound asleep
through the open bedroom door we see archie drinking a lonesome coke
petulia and archie are both in the bed asleep and somehow as far apart as two human beings can be
in the midst of her sleep petulia begins jabbering in some language all her own
archie is eyes open and he looks at her and he smiles
still sound asleep petulia finishes her statement whatever the hell it was and settles down on the pillow
archie looks at her
she wakes up
they look at each other so gravely that they both begin to smile
neither one is having the best night of their life but both are aware of a sense a of tenderness that has caught them unexpectedly
archiets bedroom morning petulia wakes up suddenly
though she is nude under the sheets archie is fully dressed for his day with the boys
though his clothes are very sporty he looks anything but sporty as he talks quietly into the phone into phone okay
wells why not do some slides anyhow
in sudden anger to satisfy myself thats who
he hangs up the phone and sees petulia looking at him
well we knocked off another one
another notch in the old stethoscope
youre a wonderful doctor archie
i keep a little black bow tie in my desk
in case the services are in the morning and have no time to go home
the neekbands all stained with sweat
why are you dressed
have to pick up the kids im already late
youre not abandoning me
i mean i wasnt all that bad was i
amateur night he leans over and kisses her mouth
before ive brushed my teeth
are you a communist archie
i guess so tell mike to watch that weight
will you be here when i get back
archie starts out then stops troubled
im divorcing david if thats what you mean thats none of my business
petulia is suddenly hurt
listen this worries me
write the number down so you wont forget
archie grins sighs and starts out
petulia will do anything to hold him one second more
archie turns at the door
dont have any illusions about all those groceries
i cant cook
and you hate loganberry jam
no as a matter of fact i rather like it
he smiles continues out
he has barely gone ten steps when he is stopped by a whistle
her head is popped out the door or window
anything to hold him anything
if somebody calls and wants medical advice on something really obscure is it okay if i wing it on my own
he makes an amused you nuts gesture and leaves but not before petulia says phone
he is gone
a a cruise boat that takes tourists across the bay is ready to go
mike and steven archies sons are anxiously waiting for their father to join them
archie is in a phone booth next to the ramp that leads to the boat
the boys are yelling to dad to come ono into phone hi to boys shut up you guys hi
whats all the noise
hes not all that fat
during this series of dumb ordinary telephone conversa tions to follow we begin seeing the moments which have brought on petulias current crisis with oliver
its a hot summer afternoon
petulia and david have driven down from san francisco
they are members of the san francisco matador club
david has drunk too much wine from his bota bag and the sour wine and the hot sun have made him violently ill
though there are still two bulls left to kill david and petulia are leaving
as she moves down the spindly stairway petulia becomes aware of oliver
he is with a gang of other kids at the butcher shed where the previous bulls are being dressed for market
they are all soaking banderillos in blood so they can be sold as the real thing
petulia and david in their convertible
david has passed out in the back seat and petulia is having a hell of a time trying to move the car out of the parking space
again kids swarm about her like wild animals trying to sell hats cushions gum pottery etc
again she sees oliver among them or is it another kid who looks like oliver
thousands of cars are waiting to get through
hot noisy dusty unbearable
kids storm every car hustling their captured audience
among them is oliver
have the others been oliver
in petulias exhaustion and discomfort the heat the flies the blaring horny she cant be sure
note all through the tijuana scenes we hear archie and petulias telephone conversation
it is utterly banal and they know it and are amused by its banality
petulia i was dozing
archie thats good
petulia you left without having breakfast
archie i had a cup of coffee on the way
petulia a cup of coffee
you should have had eggs or waffles
archie im fine
petulia me too
petulia i had a tall glass of pineapple juice
archie make some toast too
breakfast is a very important meal
petulia i wish youd remember that
archie well goodbye
petulia you wont forget to phone
archie hangs up the phone and starts running with his sons toward the boat
he is very pleased with his absolutely nothing phone conversation
children run scurrying around the mildly crowded deck
the boat is passing alcatraz island
archie and the boys are standing at the rail they used to think that escape from that prison was impossible
same scene different sunday
warren and the boys are standing at the rail
they used to think that escape from that prison was impossible
we resume with archie and the boys
b continued yes dad
warren told us that last week
well we could have gone somewhere else
i didnt know you had been
the youngest we thought maybe you had never been dad
no well thanks actually i havent been before stevie
in fact we dont call him stevie anymore
mom thinks hes getting a little old for being called stevie in fact
i called you stevie two weeks ago e we were all calling you stevie two weeks ago i was
warren says that alcatraz taught the world you can get out of anything if you want to bad enough
thats what warren said eh
the boys are watching archie who is in that section of the boat where the radar and electronic equipment are kept
archie is on the ship telephone
he is trying to keep a straight face but since he is obviously talking to petulia it is difficult
a mike to another kid doctors can do things like that
call their patients from wherever they are
archie finishes the call and returns to them smiling
how about clams on the wharf when we get back
clams make steve vomit
you forgot that
no it just slipped my mind
archie really does like his kids but his thoughts are somewhere else
while mike and stevie are gorging themselves archie is at the wall telephone
a hello there
during this silent scene we watch oliver seduce petulia into giving him a lift in her convertible
petulia is so bored as the cars take hours to get past the gate oliver is an absolute scoundrel
david is such a clod passing out in the back seat his legs hanging out over the door of the car one sandal missing
his beautiful face is somehow an obscene parody of itself fiery red from the sun
oliver mimics david petulia the guard at the gate dances skips romps annoys petulia makes her laugh dares her goads her
finally when petulias car is just one away from the border guard oliver impudently hops into the seat beside her expecting to be thrown out but also expecting maybe a
nickel in the bargain
but the jokes on oliver
petulia is even kookier than he is
is it the look of david that sickens her
is it her annoyance at having to wait so long and do the driving while he lies collapsed and useless
is it that useless that goads her
most of all petulia is doing something of absolutely no importance she knows oliver will hop out of the car the moment they reach the guard
all it amounts to is two kooks having a few seconds of horsing around
the joke is on both of them the guard harassed by the honking of thousands of cars and having fully inspected the car just ahead of petulia waves the convertible
petulia stops the car a few hundred yards past the border to let oliver climb out but he just sits there
petulia thinks okay you little bastard
and zooms down the highway intending to stop at the first moment the look of superior arrogance leaves olivers tough little face
during this we hear archie and petulias second tele phone conversation which is as blab and loving as before
archie hi there
archie im having lunch with the boys
petulia you eat a good lunch archie archie i will i will
petulia you only had a cup of coffee for breakfast
archie ill eat a good lunch petulia
petulia like what
archie petulia they have a thousand different things on the menu
petulia you should have a sirloin steak with french fries or baked beans
petulia thats easy to say archie but i know you
archie steak with french fries or baked beans
petulia do they have fresh sea food
petulia sea bass is nice
archie yes sea bass is great
petulia if they grill it archie ill have grilled sea bass
petulia unless they do a nice omelet
archie im sure they would if i asked
petulia its such a problem
archie yes i know
archie laughingly hangs up
he goes back to his kids
the sign says all the dreadful penalty of being caught in the fort
archie takes the boys in
warren take you here
he would see the sign eh
see the boys whoop off up some stairs
hey this is great
archie chases them through the floors
archie sees a telephone above which is a sign which says that this phone is for the military and is to be used only in emergency
archie approaches it warily then loses his nerve and turns back to his kids
archie wants to get back to petulia
the boys look at him uncertainly
its ten to two
can you imagine that
the time really went the boys know that means he wants to take them home
im really bushed
i feel okay
stevie is willing to let his dad off the hook
i been sneezing
so i noticed
hes always sneezing
hey next week i want you guys over for the entire weekend
none of this three or four hour stuff
to do what
you gust wait
stevie is instantly excited a stevie something really interesting
bet your life
just leave it to melt warren said something about the roller derby
friday night till late sunday
unless you guys dont want to
the roller derbys pretty darn interesting
wed have to sleep over
i mean if we were going to spend the whole weekend
i want you to
well its fine by me
me toot boy l okay its a dealt mike turns away
hes going to cry i guess he does that
archie has had a pretty good day with the boys is thinking a about petulia waiting in his apartment and feels pretty damn good about the whole thing
he opens the door of his apartment
he is carrying a bag of mexican paper flowers it is empty
archie knows at once that petulia is gone
all the joy goes out of him
the apartment is a mess
the television set is on a program without sound of soldiers fighting
archie is so disappointed that petulia isnt here
he angrily flips the dial getting the same type of program
a nice neat kid
after all the exuberance he feels so empty
everywhere things are scattered about
the bedroom is the worst of all
the sheets and blanket have literally been stripped from the bed and flung pall mall onto the floor behind
archie really is annoyed
then he stops he crosses slowly to the tangle of sheets and blanket on the floor
a lifeless arm protrudes
archie crumples to his knees and tears at the blankets
petulia is broken bloodied and seemingly dead
thi phone is off the hook
archie doesnt know where to turn first
he feels petulias throat for a pulse isnt sure she has one petulia is wearing his hooded sweatshirt from se
archie attempts heart massage but petuliats so taped up from the broken rib that this is impossible
archie presses his mouth over petulias to attempt to get her breathing again
he tries this only for an instant then crosses to the phone hangs it up and dials an emergency number
archie goes back to petulia
he feels again for a pulse in her throat can find no pulse
he begins trembling
as always when a crisis really happens it isnt as easy as the red cross advertisements say
her mouth wont open right
his mouth seems unable to make the connection with hers
it all looks more like very bad love making than a life saving procedure
two special officers are moving petulia down a hallway on a stretcher
a third walks behind her pressing a rubber oxygen mask over her mouth
we feel sunday late afternoon rudely shattered but limp ing along nevertheless
television cokes sex stereo facials isometric exercises
funny papers ailments boring endless sunday late afternoon suddenly bloodied
doors are opening up and down the hallway
people come out to stare
a big friendly old sheepdog wild with enthusiasm leaps at the stretcher and almost topples petulia
archie smeared with petulias blood his shirt tails out in a state of shock himself whams the dog as hard as he can
this entire sequence should seem like a nightmare
the dogs owner goes berserk
dont you hit lennie
archie is too distressed about petulia to even respond
at every door there is a tenant
a jumble of voices all spoken together
thats sex for you
it could be a gas leak
those rescue cops never give up
but theyre all racists
of course one of the officers is a korean and the other a negro
all through this we have also been aware of many t
sets all with programs with various kinds of violence
one youbgster comes to the door holding a portable t
and we see on the tube war casualties being flown out of the jungle by helicopters
archie has crossed ahead of the special officers to lead the way down the steps
half a dozen hippies loaded down with chinese food and a yellow guitar are coming up the steps
everything is chaos
the officers just cant manage the stretcher down the narrow stairway
poor petulia is twisted and turned every which way all in the name of saving her life
a rich old queen in purple bermuda shorts i had trouble like that with my piano
two hundred dollars to bring it through the window
and its never been the same
a record player is playing a herb alpert recording and the stretcher seems to move along to its rhythm
this is the stretch of highway going north from
the restaurant is a mass of neon and does very well in the hot coffee department as the sleepy travellers take a break on their way north
among the cars many are filled with bull fight afficianados
its about ten p
there is a general feeling of exhaustion and spent passions
people are bleary eyed recovering from hangovers beginning to feel the effects of sunburns
all this we see later
first we see oliver
oliver is sitting in the car staring coldly at david who has just awakened
david is probably just about to say who the hell are you when petulia appears carrying a cardboard carton of coffee and orange juice
david takes a sip of coffee
oliver grabs at the orange juice toppling it spilling some of it on the seat but saving most
he gulps it down then uses the straw to make bubbles
david looks at oliver and then at petulia all through the bubbles
say hello to petulia s folly
david says nothing
with careful wit if in the past you thought me a bit odd feast your eyes on this little goodie
whatas the problem
to oliver why cant you speak english
to david why the hell dont they teach them english
this little hustler picked me up in tijuana to oliver very gently whats your name
ive got a name for him
oliver doesnt understand what is being said but he is getting uneasy
lady say hey come on us go san francisco ten bucks
you bleeding little liar
oliver looks at petulia innocently
i never did
shes worried about david
what i said to this malicious little fink was that maybe one day if we went back to tijuana to oliver san francisco
each says it in his own accent and so begins a word game
he pronounces it like oliver
david doesnt answer her
to oliver whats your name
in bad spanish what are you called
pronouncing it spanish oliver
pronouncing it english oliver
pronouncing it spanish oliver
they begin laughing again
petulia is becoming t
the san diego bus is due at twelve fifteen
ive already bought him a ticket
weve got to get this on tape
hes really something else
i get a real kick out of him
imitating oliver san francisco
unless hes a midget
oliver is a sixty three year old midgets oliver grins not understanding but feeling he has an ally
to petulia get in
its still a long drive
well never get home
he can wait inside
the cashiers a sweet old dear
ill have him keep an eye on the ckeeky little bugger
she opens the car door to take oliver out tense wanting to get past this moment but fearful that she wont
you promised oliver san francisco
i did not
like hell you didnt
david abruptly hops over the seat and sits behind the wheel
he signals for petulia to get in beside oliver
i dig bitch i dig
his hand reaches out and brutally jerks her into the car
camera holds on petulias frightened face
now suddenly the face has a tube in the nose theres another tube in her throat and shes unconscious
half a dozen people are working to keep petulia alive
theyre used to their work its no big deal for them
actually the feeling should be that theyre as relaxed as if they were mechanics working on a motor car
archie sits on a white stool in a corner watching everything not as a doctor any more but as a deeply involved man
when one of the doctors hits a vein by mistake and murmurs whoops
archie can take no more and leaves
archie sits on a little stone shelf just letting the water from the shower hit him
barney is looking over the shower door at archie with a mixture of concern and anger
shouting over sound of shower did you know theres a policeman outside wanting to talk to you
archie nods dully
what the hell is going on
archie nods dully
can you have dinner with us tonight
archie nods dully
barney is working the film projector showing slides of a recent holiday with wilma and their daughter
each slide projects an enormous colored image against an entire wall
archie is slumped on a couch popping peanuts into his mouth
you like this new lens archie
is this the greatest lens you ever saw
what am i supposed to do spend the money on belly dancers
i wilma enters from another room
shes exhausted to barney ask me what your daughter put in her steam inhalator i dont want to know ask
me cottage cheese actually im relieved to archie im afraid shes madly in love with your stevie steven
wilma looks at the pictures on the wall wasnt that a gorgeous week
i just adore big sur
it rained every day
you kept insisting you were pregnant to archie you must take polo and the boys she stops embarrassed wilma the magic talking machine
put a dime in and she talks all night
im sorry archie
she might cry i just cant think of you without thinking of polo
had to drive made me run a frog test on her
forty miles in the rain
almost hit a truck
could have been dead and buried three years
through this barney keeps changing slides
suddenly there is a picture of archie polo and wilma on another vacation
in this slide they are posing in corny t shirts
the t shirts say kiss me you fool and i love the rolling stones
oh hey im sorry
wilma looks very superior
ill bet hes sorry
theres nothing wrong with a little old fashioned nostalgia
do you remember that crazy labour day weekend we drove to tahoe
too quickly ive got them right her archie frowns at wilma and barney
but they are clumsy and obvious and he is somewhat touched
i keep everything
they just happen to be here
what do you think this is a conspiracy
yes really they are all good friends and they laugh good naturedly lets see them archie
barney starts showing different slides of the tahoe vacation
archie watches scratching his ear and eating peanuts
wilma looks like the tears are about to start c
a child cries mommy
to barney you go this time
barney goes leaving the slide still showing on the wall
wilma looks at archie for a long moment
a wilma what do you want me to say
they were great old times archie whats happening to you
dontt say nothing the policeman even called here
ive had a splitting earache all day
friends have certain rights even the right to be obnoxious
do you love this woman
i well you must feel something
yeah i guess so
go to the dog pound
youll find two hundred dogs ready to be gassed
then wilma sighs
shall i tell you something
i wish i had your guts
archie is in petulias little cubicle slumped on a chair sound asleep
petulia lies on the bed tubes protruding from arms and neck
she is still unconscious
archie is awakened by a nun entering the cubicle to hook up another pint of blood
archies presence disconcerts the nun
she cant show her annoyance openly but is so disturbed she does her work badly this time
who would do such a thing to a girl like this
shes a child
is there an orthopaedic problem dr
archie doesnt answer
doctor should get his sleep
you left the needle in
the nun would like to scream at archie about the impropriety of his presence here but she cant
she is proud of the bottle of blood
from the archbishops fund
take the needle out
all races and creeds
why hasnt her husband been notified
i suppose theyve tried
it would be such a nice surprise to have his picture here when she finally awakens
wouldnt that be nice
yes it would give her some small comfort i would put a bit more tape around the needle i mentioned her this morning in the chapel
i mention all my criticals
a archie in the future be more careful of the needle
she hardly makes a bump under the sheets
archie moves closer to petulia examining her throat and eyes for vital signs
he pushes open an eyelid and petulias dead eye stares glassily into his living face
we spend awhile watching archie function as a doctor moving through the wards examining broken legs arms or whatever
in one of these scenes we pass through the orthopaedic room
oliver is being given therapy in a whirling bath
hes only one of some twenty patients and archie barely notices him simply waving to him as he does to other patients who dont need his care anymore
oliver is too frightened of the whirling bath to give a damn about the doctor
archie goes and we stay with oliver
come on come on get on with it
three weeks ago
oliver is wide awake wolfing down a loaf
of bread that he has stolen from the danner kitchen
as he gnaws on the bread he listens to indistinct sounds from the master bedroom
moans and groans a sudden cry all of which he supposes are the sounds of love making
he grins to himself in the dark
abruptly a door opens and petulia is coming down the hall
she has hastily put on a pair of slacks and a blouse and is struggling into a coat
her hair is tousled her face filled with anguish
petulia is hurriedly taking the hurriedly dressed oliver down the steps
he is protesting
before they can reach the front door the door of the master bedroom opens
david is standing there in his pyjama pants
hey san francisco
he pronounces it like oliver does
he comes down the steps three at a time
he stops before the kid
i sure hope theres no hard feelings
oliver understands none of this and of course david knows this but it doesnt stop him
it isnt a question of hospitality i want you to understand that
i feel terrible
dragging you all the way up to san francisco and then not even showing you fishermans wharf
petulia goes into the living room to find the keys to the car
hold it a minute
to oliver whats the rushy whereas the fire
he stoops down beside the boy and shows him a wrist watch
youve go to have some little memento
david for gods sakes the wrist watch is much too big for olivers skinny wrist so david starts to fasten it around olivers biceps
even this is too skinny so david starts fastening it around olivers lower leg
oliver has no idea what is happening but his hustlers heart tells him he is being given something very valuable
petulia is repelled
to oliver you see the basic problem is we just dont have the room for all the folks my old lady invites for a visit
were kinda short of room
id give you the shirt off my back
im west texas and proud of it
but start loading up the house with make believe kids plus every tom dick and harry whose one and only claim to fame is that he knows how to do
it petulia begins sobbing and trying to tug the boy toward the lift
the watch wont fasten to the leg either
david tries to fit it around the boys neck
david begins to cry
it wont fit any place
petulia somehow gets oliver into the lift and pushes the button
which starts it moving upward
calling up i dont want any hard feelings it was nothing personals hey well look you up sometime when were down that way
have a real old fashioned fiesta well have a ball oliver
during the preceding speech we cut to petulia and oliver oliver infuriated at petulia defiantly shows her that he has davids watch in his fist
he give me
petulia stares out toward the sea
davis is still screaming atl
them and his voice sounds so unlikely in all the splendor of morning coming to san francisco
archie is maneuvering his car out of his parking space when he sees the nun of the intense care unit cross to another car driven by another nuns there are
many cars with many nuns zooming around hows your patient
she woke up awhile ago
she woke up
i have called you d archie starts out of the car
shes asleep now
im to buy her blue cornflowers and a hairbrush
sister teresa phoned the police
prayers help dr
bollena she asked for mr
i hope theres no orthopedic problem
but really shes not all that bad this nun mostly she believes that the sanctity of marriage happens to be true
she is not unmoved by the look of exhaustion on archies face
they exchange a smile
imalso to go all the way across town and deliver a message to the mendoza family im to tell them everything is okay
and give them this
he takes the envelope on which the address has been written
this is the house in which oliver is boarding
now as archie drives up there is no sign of anybody
archie crosses to the door puzzled
he knocks on the door but there is no answer
he goes around to the back
theres an old car without wheels butane tanks other junk but no sign of life
archie knocks on the back door and finally the door is opened
beyond the screen door is the mexican we have seen earlier
he has been awakened from sleep and is annoyed
mendoza yawns sleepily
do you know mrs
no hablo ingles
continued petulia danner
she gave me this address the mexican shakes his head in complete indifference is already thinking about going back to sleep and starts closing the door she was beaten
almost to death
are you mr
mendoza si giving envelope this is for you gracia
he starts to open the envelope
it contains a twenty dollar bill can i talk to you for a minute
mendoza with no idea what archie is saying starts closing the door and pocketing the money
he pounds on the door
the door opens
the mexican says in in spanish i work all night
he closes the door
archie pounds on the door again
he hurts his hand
he sucks on the slight wound
he kicks at the door
he crosses around to the front of the house a negro and a white teenager are passing
do either of you fellows speak spanish
a negro teenager i speak a lot of polish if it would be any help sir
a continued ive got to talk with this man in here
a woman was almost beaten to death
you said here almost but not quite to death sir
here but not quite here
listen just find a cop huh a negro teenager hed better speak polish sir
im on a fantastic polish kick
the two chase each other down the street yelling da and paderewskii and even yawohl etc archie looks at the house and then at his car and then at his
hes furiousaz a police car passes
archie looks but somehow cant bring himself to hail it
he wonders why he let the police car pass
he goes back to his car archie moves swiftly to the screened cubicle that held petulia
he goes inside
he stops short
an old man lies in the bed with a rubber stop in his mouth to keep him from swallowing his tongue until he regains consciousness
his false teeth lie on the table beside him
archie is plunged deeper into the sense of the unreal
petulia is in a two bedded room
she has blue cornflowers and a hairbrush
she is conscious now but looks quite wan
in the next bed is a middle aged lady looking at t
petulia sees archie
a continued why werent you there when i woke up
you better not say you were when the bill comes dr
who is this guy mendoza
why am i always finding you in a different bed
what are you
avery sick girl
who beat you up
what happened to your hand
nothing happened to my hand
i love your hands
i want plaster of paris molds for bookcases
did david beat you up
was it mendoza
why did you send him money
im still very sick
i dont care
this man is a doctor
the worlds best madame the patient turns her back on the two of them
petulia youre turning me into a nut
why hasnt david been here
ask me questions
petulia is it possible for you to tell the truth about anything
so mendoza was looking after oliver for nae she s our cleaning lady s there was no mrs o mendoza z drowsily i had to have some place for him
to stay david would never have let e bring him home bring who home
iqm beginning to hurt
petuliag i dont understand the kind of world you live ina come on
st s sake a pretty young gi
rl what the hell is going on who would lay a hand on you how could you get so screwed up
through this petulia simply lies there just looking a archie
i cans t stand it
they gave me a pill
and i asleep really i am really very sleepy can we talk later archie
when ivm asleep kiss my forehead
she closes her eyes and sleeps
archie gives her fore head a kiss and she giggles
furniture is pushed back and three pup tents circle the center of the room
archie and his sons have been having a camp in
they are all dressed in jeans and sweat shirts and stevie even wears moccasins as though they were in the high sierras
the remainders of t
dinners are scattered around plus
coke bottles plus their bed rolls from last night
actually though it rust have sounded
like a great idea the two bogs are very bored archie though trying to be with it is far away and they sense it
shouldnt we police the area
police the area
this is keen dad
water canteens and everything
im out of water
always make sure youve got water
youll find some in the kitchen
whats on t
switch the fire off then
stevie goes to switch the electric fireplace off
its really keen dad
the bell rings and polo is standing there she looks around smiling
i dont believe it
even canteens mom
polo really only has eyes for archie
she is troubled by how haggard and worn he looks
roller derby starts at eight
we have to police the area
its really been keen mom
nobody ever heard of a
the two boys now busy themselves with straightening out the place as polo crosses to archie its been really keen mom
not dumb archie
i used to have such terrible anxiety that i would die suddenly
before i could say thank you archie is very touched
i have to go to
is dad allowed to come to the roller derby
i mean since uncle warren couldnt
he is so bad at matchmaking that polo and archie can hardly keep a straight face
the place is almost empty but the fans are wildly enthusiastic and are placed to look like thousands for the t
the womens team is on the rink skating banging into each other with great good natured brutality one of the skaters bucks another clear off the rink smashing through the
the kids are in heaven but polo is so shocked she instinc tively turns to archie and buries her face in his shoulder
out of habit he lets her even touching the back of her head comfortingly assuring her no fatality has occurred
mike the ace matchmaker watches them with satisfaction
dont letthat old fat butt get awa with tat to archie will you please tell
your son she turns to rchie and sees him watching the fighting intently
the women are really brutal with each other
one small blonde lady is being pummelled unmercifully by several others
as her head twists and turns from the forest of fists she seems to become petulia
i want to go home
they dont mean it
i want some popcorn
ill get it
he rises quickly and moves to the refreshment counter behind the grandstand
archie finds a telephone booth
polo watches him at the a phone booth
her eyes lose their warmth
the womens team races around the track
archie returns with a box of cracker jacks
i said popcorn
how is she
dead i hope
archie is stunned at polos abrupt coldness
you dont even know her
i just have to look at you
archie stops remembering this is approximately what petulia had said about polo
he does a how odd without saying it
shes not going to die
what a shame
she has her first visitor
polo couldnt care less
five skaters smash into each other on the rink but polo doesnt flinch
she wouldnt think of turning to archie for comfort
his mastahs inhydraul ics
they sit coldly wit their children a million miles apart
danner who is with petulia is davids father
petulia lies in the bed staring straight ahead at an enormous cotton giraffe obviously a gift
the patient in the next bed has three middle aged girl friends visiting her
they are playing bridge
their presence frustrates mr
the other patients t
set is on and on the tube we barely notice the continued violence of the outside world
its been a terrible shock to us
to mother and me
our sailor boy and his pretty bride
he stands at a great eye of a window
mother danner is mournfully quartering apples for an apple pie
as i told mother the values we lived by just dont seem to mean anything at all anymore
our kids can chuck out two thousand years of western civilization of christianity
as though it wasnt worth a red cent
i must say mothers answer surprised and well really sort of tickled me its easy to be an angel when youre old and worn out and nobody wants you anymore
you see we do try petulia
i mean there you were in that mans apartment
where i come from
in little pockets of ignorance i suppose youd call it
youll find people who still live by the unwritten law
theres still many a county courthouse where the husband could kill both parties and not spend one night in jail o
we hear sounds of a bell ringing incessantly in short bursts
the bell is still ringing signifying the end of visiting hours and the other patients visitors sigh put the playing cards together and prepare to leave
danner makes no move to leave in the hospital of my dreams people wont be chased out like sheep
people are better than most of the medicines they give you
david has finallygot around to repairing that wharf
he hired a couple of boys
the three of them are really working up a sweat
hes thinking of sailing all the way down the coast to lima
thats in peru
all through this theres no response whatever from petulia
her eyes are fixed on the eyes of the giraffe
they say lima is a terrific city
if you watch out for flies and take sensible sanitary precautions
ill tell you a secret but dont you snitch im using propaganda on david so that the four of us can go
mothers a better sailor than i am
even though i served eighteen months on a mine sweeper
which should have prepared me for anything
d continued a nun looks in
visiting hours are over
taking his turmoil out on the nun i had lunch with your mr
pearl less than two weeks ago the nun looks blank
pearl happens to be the superintendent of this hospital two weeks ago at the blue fox restaurants just the six of usl the nun shrugs and leaves
danner is really trembling now from his controlled emotion
petulia will not take her eyes from the giraffe
the patient in the next bed is grumbling something about whats sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander etc
danner abruptly takes a a small leather bound photograph from his pocket
its the wedding picture of petulia and david
without a word he puts it on the night stand
petulia will not look at it
the end of sc
is very quickly replayed
e and we continue to hear mr
its a tiny bus station and hardly anyone is around this time of morning
petulia waits with oliver who is very annoyed at what has been done to him
a few other early travelers are about
as the bus comes into sight oliver grasping his last chance of freedom suddenly darts away
in a series of flashes we see oliver hit by a car the look of agony on petuliaas face the reaction of the spectators and finally the ultimate image the
boy pinned under the wheel
during preceding scene david and i went at it hot and heavy
about the value of psychiatry
i mean sensible psychiatry
none of that sex is the reason for everything junk
it e wont ever replace a visit to the wood shed and a good whack across the backside but its late in the old ball game for that
jn o petulias hospital room night a the nun reappears
im sorry sir but its time for the ladys medication
does anyone ever report how filthy this room is
he loses all his aplomb he squats he points he finds imaginary objects on the floor
look at this
look at this
i personally raised fifty thousand dollars for this hospital during the last campaign
you didnt know that did you well ask mr pearl
i mean if you knew what he looked like
he gets up to go the nun leaves mr
danner brushes imaginary dust from his knees
hes perspiring dis hevelled and still hasnat said what he came to say
he waits there a moment more finally in a flat voice without even looking at him tell david its alright
he can come out of the cupboard
the old man almost sobs
instead he exclaims in a jolly voice
this time we are with the t
cameraman and we are looking through his scanner
we see all the excited people but among them sit archie and polo as cold as death
suddenly on the scanner we see polo rise and begin to leave tugging the two boys along with her archie makes no move to stop them
archie wearing his white doctors smock enters petulias room
thebed where the second patient lay is empty
in petulias bed is the withered old man who earlier had taken petulias place in the intense care unit
hes quite chipper now but is in many splints and braces
im not sick
dont waste time on me
archie turns to face the nun in attendance
where is she
they picked her up
worthington said it was alright so long as she had proper nursing
who picked her up
her husband i suppose
they had a long talk with dr
he seemed entirely satisfied
they kidnapped hero he hurries down the hall
thenun is startled
take care of the sick people
im in tip top shape
archie hops off the lift as it reaches the bottom of the cliff
at the front of the house we see david and two colored men at work on the wharf
at the wharf is the yacht
archie racies up to the nearest door and begins ringing the bell
petulia couldnt be lovelier or happier
shes in a special hospital bed
there are flowers everywhere
she has her own colour t
set which is silently showing scenes of violence
an efficient nurse is in attendance
the nurse is sitting at the foot of the bed and petulia is brushing the nurses hair
archie stands in the doorway overwhelmed at the normality of it all
obviously petulia has fixed her hair too
dazedly archie crosses to the night stand where there is a pitcher of tomato juice
because he has nothing else to do he sniffs the tomato juice to nurse this is dr
bollen of the hospital
hes a splendid doctor to archie this is agnes lillywhite
our young lady is doing nicely
we have a few problems but nothing serious
a i get hiccups
i go along merrily hiccupping for hours on end
why did you leave the hospital
i was feeling ever so much better archie
danner looks in
she is wearing an apron and stirring a batch of something
will you be staying for lunch sir
goodness knows theres plenty of meatloaf
she goes and david enters
he looks extremely handsome
he wears white duck pants and a slip over sweater
and a happy go lucky grin
you two havent met
to david this is dr
yes i thought so
david sees that archie has no intention of shaking his hand so he crosses to the bed and begins to playfully drank petulia up and down
to petulia i want you to go back to the hospital
worthington says shes doing fine
hes going to make daily house calls
hes very good about that
during this mr
danner has entered
he is really the only one not good at the charade
well youre finally meeting our whole family
bollen i wouldnt exactly call this good taste
not to mention medical ethics
dad you old fuddy duddy things happen
archie suspects he is having a nightmare
with the exception of mr
danner he has never seen so many cheerful people in one place
to petulia you told the policeman you had a dizzy spell
i fell on my bottom
you were beaten up
you were somebodys punching bag
wont have you cross examining this girl
your son nearly killed this girl
hey now listen doe ill stand still for only so much
to the nurse i want you to remember what this man just said
to archie though its none of your business my boy was in baton rouge louisiana
looking at boats
weve decided were quite happy with the one we have
when dad phoned me i was having dinner with a cousin of ours
real mouth watering creole cooking
he and petulia chuckle at each other as though this were some kind of private joke
archie crosses to petulia and just stands there looking at her
he doesnt know what to do
im fine archie
except i burp a lot
everybody gets dizzy spells
archie looks incredulously from petulia who has resumed brushing the nurses hair to david to mr
danner whos obviously annoyed at archies bad taste to mrs
danner who is in the dining room setting up an extra place for archie
what can he do
abruptly he rushes from the house
archie runs toward the lift that will move him up the cliff
he cant get away fast enough
he climbs into the lift and pushes the button
the lift begins moving but too slowly for him
he hops off the lift and begins scrambling up the side of the cliff
petulia looks out the window and sees archie scrambling up the cliff she fits a curler into the nurses hair
going back to the house was the only thing i could do
scenes a b d
and e occur only in petulias mind
petulia is waiting for archie at the top of the cliff as he staggers toward her
since everything is taking place in her mind this is how petulia really is
where else could i go
a lonely hotel room
i dont have a penny of my own
danner promised me id never be left alone
i thought id try it for a few days
dont be angry
it was nobodys fault
actually if anyone is to blame its you archie
o petulia now recreates the moment when she first met archie
archie is searching through his pockets for the ticket to reclaim his coat petulia rushes up to him with none of the fake nonsense of the actual meeting but with
archie is dressed as he is on the hill scene
im petulia danner
save me like you saved oliver
save me from david
dont lust scramble up the hill like a a b oody fool o b continued archie is stunned
im looking for the ticket for my raincoat
from her bedroom window petulia watches archie scramble up the hill
coming for me in that pokey little car
in petulias mind a great white ambulance is moving majestically through towering trees carrying petulia to safety
why didnt you bring a proper ambulance
as though you really meant it
i didnt know what to do
i was going from one moment to the next
spectacular entrance lousy exit
sounds familiar archie
suddenly all the anger goes out of petulia
no its not your fault
petulia dismisses the ambulance from her mind because she has something very serious to say to archie
she is with him on the rocks below the bridge
i went back to the house because i owed it to david
i have a brown thumb when it comes to men
i put them on the cross and call them jesus
and there they hang
i dont know why i do it
not because of any high opinion of myself
oh archie if you only knew
e continued she looks up at the bridge and instantly creates david standing there
an incredibly heroic figure in a white blazer and turtle neck sweater
yet somehow we must sense that despite how grand david looks at any moment in petulias mind he may leap to his death
look at him
isnt he super
a six foot three coca cola bottle
i did that
id ruin you archie
we are now back in visual reality with petulia and the playful david who is trying to make petulia laugh which she does
david was the gentlest man i ever knew
archie has neared the top of the cliff
his pants are ripped his hands are scraped he is gasping in anguish
id ruin you
in five weeks id be running around with a black eye
by now archie has reached the top of the cliff and is a complete mess
he turns for one last look at the danner house and the yacht beyond
he shakes his fist maniacally
during the following sequence of scenes archie is trying to get back to normality
hes having a nice sensible talk with warren smith polos fiance
it is a pleasant sunny day and a group of indian boys are being told about the forest by an irish guide
in the background archies two children are playing with warrens child
its never too soon to think of the boys education
warren winks at him knowingly
have you thought of doing something about that
i i i that twi lch v v d
i dont have a twitch
come and see me
dont touch it itll give you a phobia
ill fix it for free
thanks i will
you know i like you more t han i ever thought i would
warren youre a beautiful human being
they turn to watch the boys at play
nearby the guide is explaining something to the indians
what happens next
archie smiles hoeefully
beyond is the entire shockingly beautiful panorama of san francisco
archie and may are having champagne cocktails
they clink glasses and look at each other through candlelight
archie spills some of his cock tail but may doesnt spill a drop
archie smiles hopefully
archie dances with many girls some hippies some chic all terribly young and unsmiling
archie smiles hopefully
for the first eq ence began archie is not smiling
he l z ri g at petulia
archie and his boys are riding on ou side of a cable car
the car has stopped at the t p of the hill as has the car going the other way
in the other car is petulia by herself
petulia waves f
archie waves back
petulia has shopping parcels
you look better
michael and stevie
archie nods we
re going to see the penguins
everything okay with your oh yes fine
the cars start down their separate ways
thirty penguins march around the rim of their pool to the music of pomp and circumstance
through the public address system a voice explains that the penguins represent all nations and are gathered here for their own olympics which they originated two million years ago when
penguins were nine feet tall and great athletes
archie senses someone staring at him turns and sees petulia sitting in the grandstand with her parcels
he tries to ignore her by concentrating on his kids but he cannot
actually he doesnt want to ignore petulia
he looks back she is still there smiling happily
archie gestures for the boys to stay where they are then starts toward petulia
the penguins are now going through various acrobatics while the narrator is telling more about their exotic origins
archie stumbles through laughing children ruins a tourists snapshot etc
until he finally reaches petulia
now one penguin is pushing another penguin in a baby carriage
everyone thinks its adorable
archie sits beside petulia not really knowing what to say
he hasnt decided whether to be angry that she has followed him or amused or delighted or all three
now the taped music is blaring a loud marching song as the penguins lumberingly form into a roman legion the laughter music and applause
make any intimate conversa tion almost impossible
but petulia is waiting for archie to say something
archie sees that mike has turned from the penguins to stare at his father accusingly
mike wont stop staring
mike now tries to make stevie turn and look accusingly with him archie doesnt know what to do finally petulia rises and gathers her parcels still quite pleasant
she drops a parcel and archie retrieves it for hero its from a sportswear shop colorful and gay
as archie gives petulia the parcel she touches his hand running her fingers lightly over his skin thoughtful as though wanting to remember something
petulia moves quickly through people toward the exit
archie almost calls her back but there is too much noise
archie is returning from work weighted down with books for his research plus miscroscope
he sees his apartment door ajar
his heart stops
he kicks his door open with his foot not daring to think who will be inside
no youre wrong
its not petulia
two elderly gentlemen in spotless dungarees are just finishing installing a portable greenhouse in arc hies living room
the mexican paper flowers have been carefully moved
oh oho we were supposed to be out of here before you came home dr
so youd think it came from santa claus the two elderly gentlemen chuckle at archies puzzled look
sn g t t
they sell like hot cakes
gives you something alive in all this stone
there must be some mistake
he sags down on a chair draped in his research books
the two old gentlemen couldnt be more pleased
mac and i get a big kick out of peoples first reaction
its not a toy
its a working greenhouse
you control heat and humidity with these
he indicates dials youve got a little bit of everything
ornamental plants zinnias asters
even a little vegetable garden
the most important thing to remember is to keep the sun out
these new kind of lights work so much better theres no comparison
youve got the wrong apartment l no we have not s dr
bollen what screwball
i then he stops he knows what screwball
no gift card
it might come by mail
archie starts chuckling
he crosses to the green house still chuckling
this one heat and this one humidity right
weve left a manual of operations and wetll check everything out in a month
still chuckling okay okay
goodbye he enters the greenhouse having to stoop almost double as the two old gentlemen exit from the apartment
though extremely uncomfortable archie is entirely happy
suddenly he is ripping up flowers and vegetables to make a kooky bouquet
he is positively exultant
he adds radishes and turnips to the bouquet
this is the happiest we have ever seen archie
archiets car is parked on the cliff
the danner house is dark deserted abandoned
archie is standing by himself on the wharf bouquet in hand
the yacht has gone
and so has petulia
archie feels utterly alone and as a matter of fact he is
he tosses the bouquet into the water
the lettuce floats
theoretically we should be at some flea bag port in south america
mostly we see the yacht
a continued petulia is sunbathing on the yacht
she looks much better now
weeks have passed she has a golden tan
beside her a transistor radio has picked up a local broadcast which would be in either spanish or portuguese and which consists mostly of music
david hops onto the yacht carrying a bag of groceries
he too is deeply tanned marvelously healthy but somehow uneasy
did you get mama on the plane all right
but what a dinky plane
poor mamats stomach problems are far from over
he enters the cabin
petulia sits up after a moment looks about sees no one else then then in alarm peers into one of the windows that looks down into the cabin
david is stowing food into the refrigerator
you didnt leave papa alone in that horrible little town
its not such a horrible little town
he holds up a can hearts of artichokes david
take your vitamer zed you blinkint limey
b continued he uses the english way of saying vitamin and then a bit too rakishly he tosses an orange up through the window
instinctively petulia makes an effort to catch misses and it hits her lightly on the shoulder
though it causes no damage david is suddenly in terror
he races up out of the cabin to petulia
david rushes to petulia
of course the orange did no damage whatever but there is an abrupt tension between them
he flops down beside her and begins peeling the orange papa went with her at the last minute
petulia reacts shocked
she was so pale and seared
they arent even pressurized
you suck on a tube and hope its oxygen
during this he has peeled the orange and torn it into segments which he now tries to feed her
how could he have gone
just like that
where mama is concerned papa is a very loving man
instead petulia jumps frightened to her feet she seems about to leave the yacht
he dromised honey
itll be okay cross my heart
c continued a middle aged couple are passing by on their way to their luxurious yacht which is anchored close by
they are trailed by a rather tacky mari ache trio hello there you gorgeous people
everyones invited for margueritas and cha cha cha
danner are gone a s corny as this oooh la la lucky you the group goes off toward their yacht
petulia doesnt know what to do
david skims off his jeans and jackknifes into the water
the sun glints on his exquisite body
confusedly petulia pops a segment of an orange into her mouth
david surfaces from the water laughing up at her
he looks great
petulia and david are returning from the other yacht
they are dressed casually but very well
david is completely happy
petulia is uneasy uneasy hell shes frightened out of her wits
from the other yacht we still hear the sounds of the mariache trio and people squealing with delight david is humming along with the music
we didnt have to come back this early
youre still not one hundred per cent well
theyve reached the cabin
she waits outside
suddenly his hand is around her wrist somewhat too hard and in a gesture he hopes is playful he pulls her down the steps into the cabin
e continued so they say petulia says nothing
she begins undressing i didnt tell papa to leave
she doesnt answer
he only had the clothes on his back
she doesnt answer
want him to leave
all right david
a david all right david through chattering teeth
petulia crawls under the sheet of a bunk
only a crazy man hits a woman
or a coward
t wont ever again
id stick my hand into a garbage disposal
i would petulia
id grind it up petulia lies under the sheet silent rigid david abruptly crosses to a cabinet and takes out a signal flare pistol
he snaps in a flare and tosses it at petulia
she sits up in panic
hang on to it
if i come for you let me have a flare
between the eyes
ill melt in ten seconds
petulia is touched
e continued i i iuli ia i couldnt do that youtre too beautiful to melt
suddenly angry girls are beautiful so are centaurs unicorns minataurs
uts short order cooks trumpet players cavalry officers aging poets men of science
they are enjoying the nonsense
then on men of science his finger is pressed against the doorbell over which is the nameplate dr a
the door finally opens and petulia is standing there in archies hooded sweatshirt
her eyes widen in terror as david enters archies apartment
she knows he has come here to kill her g the image ends
david is abruptly withdrawn but petulia is carried away by memory
the first time i saw you you were being charming to somebody who didnt buy a boat after all you were wearing a light blue turtleneck sweater
your sunglasses warepushed up into your hair
you had sandals but no socks
to sell a forty foot yacht without socks
i had never seen anything so perfect
hes not real

iect ng then petulia sees archie beside her bed
he is wearing his hospital jacket which gives him the run of the place
they cant keep any secrets around here
when did you get back
a year ago
you didnt forget me how could i
all those laughs
he dabs a kleenex on her sweat beaded face
so things go better with mr
danner obviously they look at each other tenderly
why did you let me get away
girls like me are very rare archie archie cannot endure this i could
call an ambulance
take you to a private hospital in oakland
if we didnt make it in time so what i dont know how many babies i delivered as an intern
theres nothing to it
especially a girl with your pelvis youve got a very superior pelvis
b continued she begins to ry
wed never be apart again you dont mean it
petulia twists in pain
the nurse looks over
that wasnt four minutes
the nurse makes a note then turns her attention to another lady who must be wheeled to the delivery room i hurt
touch it archie
make it hurt less
his hand touches her belly very gently
it doesnt help
but your hands were magic with oliver
her pain has subsided and she looks up at archie
would you really
youd call an ambulance
at this late stage
say the word
im different now
damn it archie why did i go to that motel with you
b continued the pregnant ladies react to this
do you realize we were actually only a one night stand
we never even gave each other a cold all we really did was pass each other going the other way
have i changed you archie
you turned me into a nut
is that good
yes i think so who knows
i hope archie call the ambulance
archie crosses to the phone picks up the receiver then almost at once he puts it down again
a petulia when i lay dying twenty years from now a middle aged old lady wondering what my life was all about you wont even cross my mind
he starts out
he cantt even say goodbye
hey wait i lied
ill never forget you arnold
he starts laughing then she starts laughing
he crosses to her and holds her hand in his very tightly
then he leaves
archie feels unexpectedly giddy and carefree
he meets david carrying a silly sweet gift
david tenses for a show down archie impulsively flips out davids tie and continues on his way as archie exits from the hospital a kid on a roller board almost
he has an ice cream bar
he sees three pretty girls one with blonde hair like petulias
but its the dark haired girl who feels his gaze and looks back
archie watching the girl and eating his ice cream leans against an electrical appliance shop window
inside among endless other items is a single t
tube on which the worlds violence flickers silently and unnoticed as before
as we leave archie we feel a sense of euphoria well what do you know it all ended rather sweetly after all
petulia is looking up at the bright light on the ceiling
two hands move toward her face holding an ether mask
the hands seem infinitely gentle
one hand touches petulias face to reassure her
in a whisper archie
