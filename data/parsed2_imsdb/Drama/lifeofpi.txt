written by david magee based on the original novel by yann martel credits over a magical fairy tale world in collage images of fantastic creatures striped and spotted hoofed and
goats and warthogs mingle in an open field a baby giraffe tries to reach leaves over a fence rhinos roll happily in rich red mud looking like giant muddy boulders
while nearby black and white malayan tapirs cool themselves in watering holes
exotic monkeys with comical faces cling lovingly to one another swing from trees climb over one another prance and screech a probiscus monkey with a jimmy durante nose pointing out
through the plane of the screen
flamingoes strut about in the aviary their pink feathers reflected in the water
a sloth droops lazily from a tree branch unfazed while a nearby hummingbird zips manically from flower to flower like tinkerbell
the pondicherry zoo is a childrens paradise nestled in a botanical garden
you were raised in a zoo
theres a flurry of activity in the animal clinic behind a monitor lizard that wanders the main path
zoo workers gather in the doorway talking excitedly
no one notices the lizard
born and raised in pondicherry in what was the french part of india
my father owned the zoo and i was delivered on short notice by a herpetologist who was there to check on the bengal monitor lizard
the zoo owner father late s hurries down the path as quickly as his heavy leg brace will allow and hurries into the animal clinic
mother and i were both healthy
the lizard crawls away
but the poor lizard escaped and was trampled by a frightened cassowary
a modest row house
there is a french influence to the decor along with books and artwork that celebrate the spiritual
pi patel intelligent indo canadian cooks an indian meal
the often skeptical writer late s a disheveled french canadian watches pi
the way of karma the way of god
i assumed your father was a mathematician because of your name
oh far from it
i was named after a swimming pool
theres a swimming pool named pi
you see my uncle francis was born with too much water in his lungs
they say the doctor swung francis around by the ankles to clear the water out and thats what gave him the huge chest and skinny legs that made him such
a great swimmer
is francis actually your uncle
he said he was friends with your father
i call him mamaji my honorary uncle my fathers best friend my swimming guru
i trained with him three times a week at the ashram
his lessons would save my life in the end
a young indian boy pi at age five surfaces from a pool gasping
he looks up at the large chest and skinny legs of mamaji late s
mamaji reaches down to scoop pi out of the water
a mouthful of water will not harm you but panic will
mamaji carries pi back over to the waters edge
remember to breathe
dont hold your breath
mamaji unceremoniously tosses pi back in
regarding lunch i hope you dont mind vegetarian
no not at all
and your name
you you were going to tell me how you got your name i think
i got it from something mamaji once told my father
most travelers collect postcards or teacups on their journeys but not mamaji
mamaji collects swimming pools
he swims in every pool he comes upon
mamaji stands admiring the piscine molitor a pool of sparkling magnificence
attractive french men and women in bathing suits the setting a celebration of idealized beauty
one day mamaji said to my father that of all the pools in the world the most beautiful was a public pool in paris
that the water there was so clear you could make your morning coffee with it that a single swim there changed his life
mamaji dives into the crystal clear water and we follow taking in the divine miracle of his underwater journey across the pool
before i was born he said to my father if you want your son to have a clean soul you must take him one day to swim in the piscine
i never understood why my father took this so much to heart
but he did and i was named piscine molitor patel
pi age leans against the railing of a balcony reading lile mysterieuse the mysterious island by jules verne
imagine me trying to explain that name to my schoolmates
i barely made it to the age of eleven before
a boy bully calls up to him from the courtyard below
pi glances down all the boys in the courtyard watching him
are you pissing right now
the other boys laugh uncontrollably
look at him hes pissing
with one word my name went from an elegant french swimming pool to a stinking indian latrine
i was pissing everywhere
boys in school uniform kick a ball
pi attempts to join
bully intercepts the pass
no pissing in the schoolyard
even the teachers started doing it not deliberately of course
so then what might occur if we release gas too quickly
pi is aghast
several students splutter and howl whispering the slip to others
laughter ripples around the room all eyes on pi
he said pissing
thats enough order
when we returned the next year for our first day of school i was prepared
class is held in a large open room
pi age rises crosses to the front
i am piscine molitor patel known to all as
he writes pi on the board
pi the sixteenth letter of the greek alphabet
pi writes then quickly charts out a general notion of the concept on the chalkboard
which is also used in mathematics to represent the ratio of any circles circumference to its diameter an irrational number of infinite length usually rounded to three digits as
pi underlines his name faces the class
very impressive pi
now sit down
and from then on you were pi
as pi returns to his seat bully leans forward whispering nice try pissing
but i still had the whole day ahead of me
french class was next
pi repeats his act in french
on the board
je mappelle piscine molitor patel ditpi
class is held out of doors in a courtyard
pi at a portable chalkboard writes and says
these are the first twenty decimal places of pi
my last class of the day was mathematics
a librarian runs down the hall a huge book tucked under his arm followed by dozens of students
he reaches pis class pushes his way through the crowd
close on pi writing digits
pull back the entire chalkboard is filled with numbers
all watching are stunned
the librarian compares pis writing to the math book
it is right
hes really doing this
students clap and cheer even the bullies
several chant along with him as he writes
by the end of that day i was pi patel school legend
the writer laughs then ventures onto a new topic
mamaji tells me youre a legend among sailors too
out there all alone i dont even know how to sail
and i wasnt alone out there
richard parker was with me
mamaji didnt tell me everything
he just said i should look you up when i got back to montreal
so what were you doing in pondicherry
writing a novel
by the way i enjoyed your first book
the new one is it set in india
no portugal actually
but its cheaper living in india
well i look forward to reading it
i threw it out
two years trying to bring it to life and then one day it sputtered coughed and died
shrugs making light of it
i was in a coffee house in pondicherry one afternoon mourning my loss when this old man at the next table struck up a conversation
he does that
when i told him about my abandoned book he said imitating mamaji so
a canadian whos come to french india in search of a story
well my friend i know an indian in french canada who has the most incredible story to tell
it must be fate that the two of you should meet
i havent spoken about richard parker in so many years
what has mamaji already told you
he said you had a story that would make me believe in god
he would say that about a nice meal
as for god i can only tell you my story you will decide for yourself what you believe
lets see then where to begin
the shoreline bicycles and pedestrians policemen in round flat top french hats
pondicherry is the french riviera of india
in the streets closest to the ocean you might think you were in the south of france
grey ashram buildings which give way to images of
the canal and just beyond it indian pondi
a few blocks inland theres a canal just beyond that is indian pondicherry
the muslim quarter women in head scarves pass men baking flatbread over coals the mosque in the background
and the muslim quarter is just to the west
when the french handed pondicherry back to us in the town decided that some sort of commemoration was in order
the sign on the gate reads jardin botanique de my father who was a clever businessman came up with one
he ran a hotel and he got the idea to open a zoo in the local botanical gardens instead
father oversees a sign painter as the painter who adds the words and zoo to the sign
women workers plant and dig in the botanical gardens nursery
as mother refined s passes by she admonishes a worker who pulls up a sapling with too much force
as it also happened my mother was a botanist in the gardens
they met married and a year later my brother ravi was born
i came two years after that
it sounds magical growing up in the writer stops realizing that pis eyes are closed in prayer
the writer watches in awkward silence his head halfbowed
i didnt know hindus said amen
as he serves food catholic hindus do
we get to feel guilty before hundreds of gods instead of just one
but youre a hindu first
none of us knows god until someone introduces us
i was first introduced to god as a hindu
there are million gods in the hindu religion how can i not come to know a few of them
young pi and ravi listen to mother quietly singing a gentle tune as she kneels before their home using rice powder to draw a kolam pattern a geometric design meant
to bring the home prosperity
i met krishna first
yashoda once accused baby krishna of eating dirt tut tut you naughty boy you shouldnt do that
it is raining outside
pan from the window mother lies in bed with pi as they continue sharing this story for the thousandth time
mothers voice plays over note they speak in tamil throughout the following dialogue but he didnt
thats what he told her
i didnt eat dirt
well then open your mouth
so krishna opened his mouth
pi opens his mouth in imitation
and what do you think yashoda saw
she saw in krishnas mouth the whole entire universe
pi has made a tent of his blanket a flashlight glowing beneath the covers
in his tent pi flips through the pages of a hindu comic book enthralled by the story of krishna
the panels of the comic book show krishnas mouth falling open revealing stars and planets the universe unfolding in wondrous detail
a tank ceremony is about to begin
the tank is a square reservoir the size of a soccer field pis family sits among the crowd on the steps that lead down to the water
the gods were my superheroes growing up
hanuman the monkey god lifting an entire mountain to save his friend lakshmana
ganesh the elephantheaded risking his life to defend the honor of his mother parvati
vishnu the supreme soul the source of all things
vishnu sleeps floating on the shoreless cosmic ocean and we are the stuff of his dreaming
with quiet sincerity
dont let the stories and pretty lights fool you boys
religion is darkness
my dear appa believed himself part of the new india
as a child hed had polio he used to lie in bed wracked with pain wondering where god was
in the end god didnt save him western medicine did
below mother watches the ceremony lost in contemplation
my amma went to college and thought her family was part of the new india as well until her parents cut her off because they thought she was marrying beneath
her religion was the only link she had to her past
rocky mountaintops jut up through a sea of clouds and mist
i met christ in the mountains when i was
we were visiting relatives tea growers in munnar
it was our third day there ravi and i were terribly bored
ravi walks up to pi coins in hand and whispers
ill give you two rupees
run into that church and drink the holy water
pi leans down to the font beside the door and drinks
hes about to leave again when he notices the stations of the cross depicted on plaques that encircle the church
you must be thirsty
here i brought you this
not knowing what else to do pi takes the glass and drinks
an awkward pause as he searches for something anything to say
he finally points up to one of the paintings
why would a god do that
why would he send his own son to suffer for the sins of ordinary people
the priest smiles down upon pi
because he loves us
god made himself approachable to us human so we could understand him
we cant understand god in all his perfection but we can understand gods son and his suffering as we would a brothers
that made no sense
sacrificing the innocent to atone for the sins of the guilty
what kind of love is that
ravi and other kids play cricket
pi sits by a stream lost in thought
but this son i couldnt get him out of my head
pi stands quizzing the priest near the altar
if god is so perfect and were not why would he want to create all this
why does he need us at all
all you have to know is that he loves us
god so loved the world that he gave his only son
this son taught us to love one another
the priests words continue as pi leans in listening
the more i listened to the priest the more i came to like this son of god
pi kneels smiling in an attitude of worship
thank you vishnu for introducing me to christ
i came to faith through hinduism and i found gods love through christ but god wasnt finished with me yet
as pi wanders through the muslim quarter the call to prayer plays out over a loudspeaker affixed to the nearby mosque
pi watches as people pray
god works in mysterious ways and so it was he introduced himself again this time by the name of allah
pi crosses inquisitively up the few steps of a mosque in the muslim quarter looking inside where dozens of the faithful are lined up row upon row praying
the speaker on top of the mosque plays the muslim call to prayer
pi is out in front of the house kneeling on a prayer mat repeating a prayer
father passes by with friends
he stops to watch pi
father sits at the dinner table with his family
the servant offers a dish of lamb to father only
father pops a bite into his mouth savoring it
this lamb is exquisite its best dish on the table
you are all missing out
as he chews father notices pi completing a blessing
you only need to convert to three more religions piscine and you will spend your life on holiday
laughing are you going to mecca this year swami jesus
or to rome for your coronation as pope pi us
you stay out of this ravi
just as you like cricket pi has his own interests
no gita ravi has a point no
you cannot follow three different religions at the same time piscine
because believing in everything at the same time is the same as not believing in anything at all
hes young santosh hes still finding his way
and how can he find his way if he does not choose a path
to pi listen instead of leaping from one religion to the next why not start with reason
in a few hundred years science has taken us farther in understanding the universe than religion has in ten thousand
that is true
your father is right
science can teach us more about whats out there with a hand to her heart but not what is in here
art music literature they all spring from our faith
some eat meat some eat vegetable
i do not expect us all to agree about everything
but i would much rather have you believe in something i dont agree with than to accept everything blindly
and that begins with thinking rationally
do you understand
i would like to be baptized
father and mother react
ravi stifles a laugh
pi walks down the front steps of his row house stretching and rubbing his belly at the end of a good meal
the writer follows
so youre a christian and a muslim
and a hindu of course
and a jew i suppose
oh well i do teach a course on the kabbalah at the university
and why not
faith is a house with many rooms
but no room for doubt
on every floor
doubt is useful
it keeps faith a living thing
after all you cant know the strength of your faith until its been tested
pi and ravi cross into a drab cement enclosure behind the tiger exhibit
a hallway with closed gates at both ends leads out to the exhibit
we shouldnt be in here without him
i have seen him do this a thousand times
i want to meet our new tiger
he drops meat on the floor by the bars
pi and the writer walk along a montreal street
the writer stares at pi bewildered
richard parker was a tiger
he got his name through a clerical error
a hunter caught him drinking from a stream when he was a cub and named him thirsty
when thirsty got too big the hunter sold him to our zoo but the names got switched on the paperwork
the hunter was listed as thirsty and tiger was called richard parker
we laughed about it and the name stuck
before we get into trouble
i want to see him close up
youre not a zoo keeper
an adolescent bengal tiger appears at the other end of the hall
ravi bolts running out of the feeding area
pi is enchanted
offering meat thats it richard parker
its for you
pi holds the lamb through the bars the tiger walks slowly down the hallway regarding pi with a detached curiosity as unthreatening in his manner as a large housecat
pi begins trembling from sheer excitement
he doesnt hear the approach of uneven footsteps father appears followed by ravi
just as richard parker approaches the offering
father yanks pi violently away from the cage wrenching pis hand through the bars
richard parker startled raises his head hissing
he turns and bounds back out through the gate at the other end of the hallway disappearing into the exhibit area
father spins pi around and shoves him against the wall
what are you thinking
are you out of your mind
who gave you permission to come back here
you have just ignored everything i have ever taught you
i just wanted to say hello to him
you think that tiger is your friend
he is an animal not a playmate
animals have souls
ive seen it in their eyes
father turns to ravi who stands by the gate
father pi and ravi watch as selvam carries a goat into the feeding area
in tamil youre sure mr
pis just a kid
in tamil do it
selvam sets the goat down and ties a piece of rope around the animals neck
to the boys animals dont think like we do people who forget that get themselves killed
that tiger is not your friend
when you look into his eyes you are seeing your own emotions reflected back at you nothing else
selvam ties the goat to the bars at the gate area where pi had been about to feed richard parker
quietly to pi dont be stupid
say youre sorry
mother arrives at the gate with a woman worker and rushes to pis side
what have you done piscine
you know what your father said about coming back here
mother turns to father quietly referring to the goat what are you thinking
this is between a father and his sons
in tamil selvam the gate
he said hes sorry
you want to scar them for life
that boy almost lost his arm
but hes still a boy
he will be a man sooner than you think and this is a lesson i do not want them ever to forget
turning to selvam selvam
selvam opens the far gate
richard parker re enters the hallway
he sees the goat and slinks forward lowering his body his ears flattening against his skull
the goat freezes
everyone watches in silence transfixed by the intensity of the tiger
pi watches the animal spirit glowing up within richard parkers eyes as instinct takes over
in a sudden single burst richard parker bolts the length of the hallway claws reaching out through the bars of the cage toward the goat
we dont see what happens next but the family does
on the cage only a few seconds have passed but richard parker has already turned to go back into his enclosure the lifeless goat in his mouth
the family watches father is impassive ravi traumatized mother wraps her arms around pi
a rainy early morning in monsoon season
pi now lies in bed reading notes from the underground
ravi is still asleep
the radio plays in the other room
and so has placed the country in a state of emergency
under the directive the states of gujarat and tamil nadu will be placed under the direct authority of the central government
police will be granted powers to arrest and indefinitely detain citizens responsible for the uprising
ravis alarm goes off
ravi reaches to shut it off
end of the school day
pi in raincoat walks out to the street where student bicycles are lined up by the hundreds
he gets his bike
things changed after the day of appas lesson
the world had lost some of its enchantment
school was a bore nothing but facts fractions and french
words and patterns that went on and on
i grew restless searching for something that would bring meaning into my life
and then i met anandi
close on anandi radiant graceful eyes aglow dancing with passionate intensity
mother made me study music and one day my teacher came down with the flu he asked if i could take his place one afternoon playing rhythms for a dance
pi watches her hopelessly in love absent mindedly drumming along
he is drumming for a class of a dozen female students a dance master female accompanies the beat vocally tumtikita
the dance master claps her hands interrupting to teach
if you do not concentrate you cannot express your love of god through dance
feel the ground beneath your feet
open your gaze out onto the horizon let that spiritual energy pulse through you and out into the world through abinea
anandi come to the front lead them
anandi obeys pi watches her lost in admiration until the teacher taps a wood block to get his attention
the girls in the class giggle pi blushes embarrassed
anandi walks with two of her friends through the town market
across the market pi hides behind a flower sellers stall
gathering his courage he peers out searching for anandi
she is nowhere to be seen
he walks into an open area of the market that surrounds a banyan tree
suddenly he hears a voice behind him
why are you following me
pi turns anandi stands before him her friends a short distance behind her eavesdropping
you were following me
after a beat to cover his evident guilt what does this mean
pi vaguely imitates the hand gesture pinching the tips of his fingers together that he saw anandi use in the dance rehearsal
anandi stares at him bewildered
in the dance you went from pataka which means the forest and then you did then you did samputa which means something that is hidden and after that you did
and then you did chatura
pi demonstrates her dancing
anandi smiles while her friends giggle at his performance
but at the very end you did this
repeating the gesture none of the other dancers did that
what did you mean
the god of love is hiding in the forest
no that also means the lotus flower
the lotus flower is hiding in the forest
why would a lotus flower hide in the forest
she has no answer
pi and anandi stand at the bengal tiger cage pi proudly introducing anandi to the zoos finest exhibit
and this is richard parker
hes the most magnificent creature weve ever had here
look at the way hes turning his head
showing off like a dancer
no he heard something hes listening
pi sits at dinner with the family a half smile on his face obviously lost in thoughts about anandi
fathers voice gradually breaks through into pis consciousness
we have talked about it for some time
do you understand what im saying
pi glances over
for my family
our animals are worth far more abroad than here in india and if the town council stops supporting us i dont know where well be
it is what we have to do
do you understand
what are we talking about
we are leaving india
we are selling the zoo
the zoo itself was never ours to sell the land belongs to the town
but the animals are ours and if we sell them we will have enough to start a new life
but where would we go
our life is here appa
i have some opportunities for work in winnipeg
ill be shipping most of the animals for sale in north america we can get freighter passage for the whole family
so it is settled
we will sail like columbus
but columbus was looking for india
pi and anandi sit together on the crossbeams beneath the dock
anandi takes a length of colored silken threads tying them around pis wrist to serve as rakhi a sisterly blessing for protection on his journey
it takes a lot of work to sell a zoo before we left anandi and i had time enough to break each others hearts
of course i promised id come back one day
i remember everything else about our last day but i dont remember saying goodbye
as she finishes pi reaches out impulsively to hold her hand
pi stands at the railing of the cargo ship staring out at the chennai shoreline
pi theyre serving dinner below
pi doesnt respond
mother approaches and stands beside him
after a beat
piscine you have a whole life ahead of you
were doing this for you and ravi
come inside and have some dinner
the family stands in the mess hall line along with the crew
the french cook a grizzled and thoroughly unpleasant man loads a plate and slides it over the counter to mother
the meal consists of liver and onions sausages and rice soaked in gravy
mother points at her rice
my sons and i are vegetarians
do you have anything
the french cook ladles ore gravy over her rice
not more gravy
thick french accent you dont want gravy
quickly switching to french no i want something vegetarian
i the cook takes her plate sets it on the counter in front of father
the following takes place in french subtitled
she asked if you have something vegetarian
vegetarian the cow that produced this liver was vegetarian the pigs that went into these sausages were vegetarian
but she doesnt eat liver
getting irritated then she can eat the sausages the rice the gravy
to mother or you can go cook your own food
how dare you talk to my wife like that
the cook shoves a plate of plain rice over the counter
heres your rice
i cook for sailors not curry eaters
father grabs the cooks forearms yanking him halfway over the high counter
what did you call us
let go of me
who do you think you are
youre nothing but a servant
i feed people
you feed monkeys
ill teach you respect
sailors descend on the two pulling them apart
the family sits eating silently in the aftermath of the scuffle
a taiwanese sailor comes alongside pi carrying a plate of rice with gravy
he speaks with a taiwanese accent and a gentle smile
hello i am happy buddhist so i eat rice next to gravy
on ship gravy is not meat
pi smiles in gratitude but the gravy looks anything but appetizing
pi eats a banana from the food set aside for the animals in the cargo hold
he sits next to the transport cage of orange juice a female orangutan with a baby orang in her arms
animal crates and cages surround pi the air filled with screeches and growls
father enters the hold carrying food for the animals
noting pis banana dont worry we will have plenty of fresh supplies after we stop in manila
father mixes tranquilizer pills into food for the orangs
why give o
shes not going to cause any trouble
the stress of traveling is not good for the animals
and it helps with the seasickness
we dont want to be cleaning up after a seasick orangutan do we
pi looks up notices father watching him
father tries to smile along with his little attempt at humor but his manner is stiff his eyes furtive and uneasy
my father was a businessman he had never handled the animals himself
i realized that leaving india must have been harder for him than it was for me
adult pi and the writer sit on a bench in the gardens
pi has fallen silent reflective
have i forgotten anything
i think youve set the stage
so far we have an indian boy named after a french swimming pool on a japanese ship full of animals heading to canada
now we have to send our boy into the middle of the pacific and and make me believe in god
well get there
moving in on the mariana trench an ominous gash of darkest blue
it was four days out of manila above the mariana trench the deepest spot on earth
zoom closer until the blue fills the screen
our ship the tsimtsum pushed on bullishly indifferent to its surroundings
it moved with the slow massive confidence of a continent
lightning and thunder
the freighter sailing in ominous weather the name tsimtsum emblazoned on its hull
choppy seas rains a storm
darkness the faint glow of a nightlight
close on pis sleeping face the cabin swaying in the storm
a loud deep rumble breaks into his consciousness
the ship shakes
pis eyes open
he looks around listens
he leans over the side of his bunk and wakes ravi
did you hear that
its a thunderstorm
lets go watch
are you crazy
well get hit by lightning
no we wont
itll hit the bridge first
dont tempt a storm pi
on the other side of the narrow room mother shifts uncomfortably on the double bed she shares with father
pi heads upstairs to the deck
the deck of the ship is dark
pi steps out into a bracing rain and walks to the rail wind whipping his hair
he laughs exhilarated as rain splashes over his face
throwing arms wide pi dances in imitation of anandis dance slipping more than once on the rain soaked deck shouting in giddy adolescent triumph
more rain lord of storms
let it rage
he finishes laughing as he falls against the railing
the deck lights suddenly all come on at once a warning alarm sounds over the loudspeakers
pi slips to the front of the deck and stands up watching in horror as a wave washes over the bow carrying several sailors overboard
he pushes himself away from the railing and runs back down below
pi stumbles down the tilted staircase
halfway down pi hits water
he dives searching for his family
the hall lights flicker the passage falls dark an instant before the emergency lights come on in the water below which nearly reaches the ceiling
pi dives trying to swim against the flowing current hes astonished to find a zebra swimming toward him passing overhead
he tries to swim further but the enormous force of rushing water and air is too great he scrambles backward groping toward the stairwell
pi bursts on deck coughing and gagging for air
pi sees movement animals running
he scrambles toward them the ship groaning as it lists sideways
oxen and deer are visible on the far side of the deck backlit by emergency lights pi hears monkeys screeching the clatter of hoofs pounding
in the distance sailors shout orders in panicked voices
pi comes onto the lower deck where he sees three men the buddhist taiwanese sailor from the dining hall the japanese captain and sailor arguing with the french cook who
has climbed into the stern of one of the lifeboats that hangs off the side of the ship
pi runs to the captain
please save my family
wait stay here
he grabs a life vest and starts to put it on pi
here put this on
you have to help them please
oh no my family please
you have to help them my family is back there
we dont have time
the taiwanese sailor jumps onto the ship
you must go
who let all the animals out
they shove a life vest over pis head
you have to go now
my father he cant swim this is your last chance just go
they guide pi to the side where a section of the ships railing has been removed to give access to the lifeboat
they push pi over the edge pi falls onto the lifeboat bouncing on the protective tarp that is still stretched taut across the bow
he grabs at the rope holding the bow trying not to slip off
the sailors are shouting at the french cook who stands at the stern
what are you doing
loosen the lines
bring it down
tie it down
tie it down
to the sailors jump
the sailors look towards the upper deck
pi follows their looks and watches in horror as a zebra launches itself over the side of the ship careening through the air toward the safety of the lifeboat
the french cook staggers backward and jumps out of the way falling to the water below
pi throws up his arms as the life boat starts to drop
the zebra arcs through the air missing the tarp landing on the exposed stern with a sickening thud shattering the rear bench
the force sends the rig lines spinning
the lifeboat plummets to the water below
the impact spins it around nearly washing pi overboard
he is left clinging to the back of the tarp the zebra on the floor of the lifeboat before him
as the lifeboat drops down the side of the swell pi slides to the front of the tarp
the tsimtsums propeller rises behind him
as pi steadies himself a swell lifts the lifeboat crashing it onto the deck of the tsimtsum
it drops back into the sea rolling over completely
the vessel instantly rights itself the lifeboat is designed to be virtually unsinkable
pi lands on the lifeboats floorboards next to the zebra
pi sees the tsimtsum at an angle its bow dipping below the water
as he tries to get up pi notices the orange emergency whistle that dangles from the vest
he grabs it and blows shouting between blasts
the deck lights of the freighter glow with a cheery unnatural brilliance
by the light of the ship pi can just make out a distant figure in the water
pi spies a lifebuoy tied to a rope
he grabs it and heaves it as far as he can across the water
out in the water the lifebuoy splashes a few yards away from the shadowy figure
the moment pi feels the tug on the line he jumps into the uncovered part of the boat lies back and begins hauling the rope in
nearly finished he lifts his head to peer over the side and sees who hes rescued
a beat and then pi realizes what hes done
he scrambles backward in horror trying to throw the rope overboard
richard parker paddles toward the boat
pi grabs an oar wielding it against the approaching tiger
richard parker tries to grab the oar
pi yanks the oar away falling onto his back
he listens as richard parker claws his way up the side of the swaying boat coughing and gagging water
pi scrambles backward oar still in hand
he rises and jumps overboard
pi plunges into the roiling water
an enormous wave rolls toward pi filling his lungs with air pi dives under away from the assault of the raging storm
silence as pi hangs below the surface arms wide groping for focus and calm
lightning casts a blazing white veil over the surface of the water above him backlighting fish and animals waves frozen in time like wrinkled bedsheets their motionless texture pocked and
dimpled with raindrops
as the sky explodes in white flashes the scene is caught in surreal still shots
a hippo swims past its heavy form moving gracefully
pi swims toward the camera then freezes reacting in horror as
a shark swoops past him and up toward the struggling animals near the surface
pi dives defensively the camera follows
ahead the tsimtsum is visible fifty feet beyond pi its deck lights dipping below the surface casting an eerie underwater glow bubbles flowing up to the surface nearby pi can
make out the floating oar
pi bursts above water in total panic throwing his arms around the oar coughing up sea water and bile
the lifebuoy floats a dozen feet off he swims toward it
he grabs the oar moments before a huge wave sweeps him up and over the lifeboat
he lands on the other side the oar lost and drags himself onto the stern
he jumps over the kicking zebra and scrambles onto the boat tarp
an oar sticks out from under the boat cover hanging out over the front of the lifeboat
pi climbs out on the oar keeping himself a safe distance from the tiger he assumes is beneath the tarp
the air vibrates with a tremendous belching groan pi looks over to the cargo ship watching astounded
wide shot from top looking down into the water the tsimtsum abruptly keels and sinks beneath the surface
pi watches in horror as the tsimtsum plummets into the depths of the mariana trench its deck lights gradually fading
pi bursts into tears as waves from the sinking vessel buffet his lifeboat
pi weeps uncontrollably
the storm has passed but the skies are still heavy with disgusting grey clouds
pi has hung the lifebuoy on the oar and now sits on it slumped in exhaustion and shivering
with what energy he still has he weeps his face is puffy and swollen from a night of tears
pi watches a shark fin knife through the waves
his feet have been trailing in the water he quickly lifts them out
he raises his head looking at his new surroundings water and air clouds and sky
nothing on the horizon
pi creeps forward on the oar pulling himself onto the gunnels the side of the boat
no sign of richard parker
the zebra comes into view in the stern of the lifeboat injured legs folded beneath it staring indifferently into space
pi stands a few feet away from the zebra using an emergency bucket to bail water out of the bottom of the boat exhausted from the effort
he pauses to catch his breath then becomes aware of a slight movement at one side of the tarp
a spotted hyena lurches furtively into view from beneath the tarp then disappears again
pi freezes dumbfounded
hari the hyena with a sloping bear like forehead and the nervous manner of a beaten dog reappears
pi instantly dives across the tarp scrambling for safety on the oar
the hyena staggers and stumbles listlessly
pi turns to face the creature struggling for calm
looks as though your drugs havent worn off yet
the screech of a terrified animal echoes across the water the hyena looks out to port the hair rising on its back then staggers beneath the tarp
pi squints into the rising sun
an enormous bundle of bananas bobs into view
the bundle twists and rolls and orange juice the orangutan tries desperately to stay on top
within moments the bundle is within reach of the lifeboat pi catches the oar handle in the netting that binds the bananas together and pulls it against the side of
falls onboard in a stuporous fog
welcome to pis ark
the netting wrapped around the handle of the oar pulls loose from the bananas which tumble out of reach
as pi reels the netting in o
moans in distress
pi throws a banana to o
but she is too sick to react
a sudden realization where is your boy orange juice
pause ill bet mother and father found him
theyll all be here soon
turns to look at pi a look of inconsolable sadness in her eyes as though she knows better what lies ahead
flies circle the zebra landing on pis face and arms
hes too exhausted to brush them away
the only sound is the incessant lapping of water against the hull
pi stares out across the ocean no rescue in sight
he pushes himself upright calling over the waves
pi kneels and bangs his bailing bucket against the hull
the hyena emergees shaking its head violently in an attempt to clear its thoughts
it screams in frustration and begins yipping
pi picks up the oar and pokes the hyena to fend it off
he watches with increasing alarm as the hyena paces in frantic circles whatever tranquilizers this animal received are wearing off
the boy wraps his grip around the paddle prepared to defend himself
the hyena abruptly stops pacing coughing and retching then lies down shaking from emotional and physical distress
it sets its head on the edge of the tarp predator eyes fastened on pi
a boy a hyena a zebra and an orangutan silhouetted against the last fading light of day
pi has hung the paddle and lifebuoy off the end of the boat and perches on the bow
the hyenas eyes seem to glow in the last light fixed on pi
pi stares back
pi fights fatigue as waves splash interminably against the hull
he winces at each creak of the lifeboat his eyes glaze over as he stares out at the endless dusky seascape
pi sees movement in the shadows
the hyena attacks the zebra the zebra barks and squeals
reacts to the violence crying out
pi slumps over the oar eyes half open glazed
he has stayed up a second night for fear of being attacked and now he slowly nods sideways giving in to exhaustion despite himself and tumbles into the water
pi gasps in shock as the water slaps him into full consciousness
he climbs back onto the life ring coughing tired wet sad and fearful
the lifeboat rolls and growls beneath pis feet as he stares and then he notices o
the poor orang is sitting on a side bench half hidden by the tarp and horribly seasick
her tongue lolls out of her mouth and shes visibly panting
im sorry o
i dont have any seasickness medicine for you and then it strikes him
pi pulls up the edge of the tarp nearest the bow
a row of benches with hinged lids curve around the bow
pi opens the rearmost bench and finds a lifeboat manual and navigational guide in a plastic bag along with a pencil lying on top of bags of supplies
he pulls out the manual and flips through it an illustration shows that the boat is lined with compartments
he opens the next bench its stuffed with life jackets
he tosses one of the life jackets to o
who has no idea what to make of it
turns to watch him utterly bewildered
an hour later
pi finishes tying a knot in a piece of rope that joins oars to the lifebuoy
pull back to reveal that pi has built a makeshift raft tying three oars into a triangle around the lifebuoy and using the banana net to gather the life vests
into a bunch beneath
pi sits back mopping his brow then begins pushing and dragging his raft over to the edge of the lifeboat to launch it
the hyena comes out from under the tarp to see what all the noise is
as it paces it gets too close to o
who suddenly comes to life rising up to her full height pulling back her lips and roaring
the hair on the hyenas neck and shoulders stands up suddenly it launches an attack
pi cries out flinching but o
uses one of her long arms to thump the beast on top of the head
pi cheers the blow but the hyena gets up in an instant it attacks again this time going for o
gets pulled down to the floor of the boat the battle continuing out of view
pi searches through the piles of rope finding a knife
he rises and dashes forward
pi reaches the end of the tarp
the hyena retreats
lies in the stern dead
pi enraged confronts the hyena
pi feels the tarp move under his feet
suddenly richard parker launches like a blur from under the canvas going straight after the hyena
pi falls backward on the tarp stunned
as the tiger clamps his jaws around the hyena finishing it off pi leaps back to the bow shoving his makeshift raft into the water
the raft splashes in the water and the tiger turns pi looks back and comes face to face with richard parker
the tiger stands with front feet on the crossbench sniffing the sea air examining his surroundings for the first time agitated by this open air environment
as he turns to go back under the tarp his gaze falls on pi
richard parkers ears swivel and his lip twitches revealing a canine as long as a finger
pi terrified grabs an oar and holds it out trying to prevent an attack
unfortunately he also blocks richard parkers path back under the tarp
the tiger tries to go around the oar and when pi blocks his way the tiger swings a paw knocking the oar into the ocean with such force that pi
is spun completely around with his back to the tiger
he falls into a crouch cowering prepared to die
richard parkers predator instinct takes over
he snarls and pounces on the tarp menacingly close to pi then hesitates unsettled by the softness of the tarp beneath his feet
the tiger retreats examining his surroundings
pi jumps toward the raft
he belly flops into the ocean and rises in a panic trying to scramble up onto the raft only to have it flip completely over his head
grey lifeless skies above the vastness of the ocean
pi shivers his eyes glassy his lips chapped and skin waxen from hours of exposure
he tries various ways to re shape the raft
a shark slips up alongside pi and bumps him sending pi scrambling back to the safety of the raft
pi pulls the raft to the back of the lifeboat tying the rope line on one of the tarp hooks
hands appear on the gunnels
pi lifts his head over the bow
the tiger is nowhere in sight
pi quietly climbs aboard
he tries in vain to control his chattering teeth and shaking limbs as he opens the starboard bow storage bench
he sees a duffel bag zips it open and rifles through the contents
it contains an array of survival supplies as he lifts it out his eye falls upon a stack of cans marked water
he pops a hole in a water can with the can opener and drinks one tilting his head back and closing his eyes in ecstasy
he throws a few on the raft
he grabs a couple of boxes marked baked wheat biscuits
pi tears open a box and stuffs a biscuit into his mouth
the biscuits are so dry that he is barely able to chew them crumbs fall from his lips into the supply hatch
a rat skitters out from under the tarp grabbing biscuit crumbs then retreating
a low growl
richard parker charges out from his den and bounds onto the tarp
pi staggers in terror and falls helplessly into the storage bench with only his head poking out above the tarp
the tiger steps toward pi then hesitates again the softness of the tarp unnerves him
he steps back off the tarp and paces the stern
pi creeps out of the storage bench then watches in horror as richard parker swivels and charges him again this time beneath the tarp
the rat scurries back out of hiding and richard parkers head follows looming up out from the gap between the tarp and the storage bench
pi jumps onto the tarp out of the tigers reach
richard parker scrambles backward and reappears at the far end of the tarp roaring prepared to attack from above then halts watching in astonishment as the rat hops around the
lifeboat finally running up pis shirt and landing on pis head
pi grabs the rat by the tail and throws it
the rat sails paws and tail stretched wide across the boat
richard parker opens his mouth and the rat flies in its tail disappearing between the tigers lips like a spaghetti noodle
as richard parker enjoys his treat pi climbs backward over the bow unhooking the rope grabbing the water cans and the biscuits and slipping over the side falling into the
he drops onto the raft and pushes himself back with his feet
the raft floats back and hits the end of the ropeline with a jerk
pi remembers the rope and goes back to untie it
suddenly richard parker appears at the bow and lunges at him almost falling off the front of the lifeboat onto pi
the tiger scrambles back onto the boat and off the tarp while pi paddles the raft away
when he is finally at a safe distance fear and stress overwhelm pi he throws up what little food and water he has taken
a full moon backlit clouds rolling through the skies reflected in the water below
pi floats behind the lifeboat weeping surrounded by nothing but terror and the abyss
a thick range of clouds moves in threatening to cut off the light from the moon and stars
pi watches richard parker on the lifeboat a shadowy silhouette on the bow ahead
the tiger takes the zebra carcass under the tarp
the clouds blot out the sky
darkness envelops them
angle on pi the raft and boat from above lost on an endless ocean the bright colors of morning light dancing on the surface of the water
pi has taken out his pencil and now writes on the back page of his survival manual his voice heard over my name is pi patel
i have been in a shipwreck
i am on a lifeboat alone with a tiger
please send help
he tears the page out and stuffs it into an empty water can sealing the opening with a plastic lid
he tosses it as far as possible the can splashes down rippling the water then bobs going nowhere
pi stares at the bobbing can crushed as he sees the futility of this plan
a defeated pause and then pi looks up and sees the majesty of his surroundings
the cloud cover breaks dawn light glows down on pi
a grunt from the lifeboat
pi turns surprised
he grabs the tow line and reels into the lifeboat
he lifts the tarp richard parkers eyes glow out at him from the shadows greeting pi with a low snarl
pi gingerly lowers the tarp and casts the raft back from the bow
he looks up
in awe shuddering god
i give myself to you
i am your vessel
i want to know
pi sits on his makeshift raft flipping through his manual
the foldout map of the manual shows the oceans currents longitudes latitudes and depths
pi stares at the chart bewildered by it all
he rises up on his knees looking out at the ocean around him then sits back hand to forehead
there are no lines
montage pi struggling with discomfort on his raft
set your house in order and dig in for the battle to survive
establish a strict schedule for eating keeping watch and getting rest
do not drink urine or sea water
keep busy but avoid unnecessary exertion
the mind can be kept occupied by playing card games twenty questions or i spy
community singing is another sure fire way to lift the spirits
telling stories is highly recommended
above all dont lose hope
pi scratches marks into the side of the boat to indicate the passage of time it is his th day at sea
pi is still reading his survival manual
the waves pick up
the lifeboat rocks
somewhere beneath the tarp the tiger lets out a faint groan of discomfort
on pi as he contemplates this
few things can sap the spirit faster than seasickness
waves are more strongly felt when a boat turns sideways to the current
a sea anchor is used as a drag to keep the boats head to the wind
proper use of them can increase control and reduce seasickness during rough seas
pi takes a sea anchor from inside his life ring and tosses it overboard
as soon as the sea anchor has been deployed the raft slows down and the anchor lines go taut
pi has rigged an additional line between the open end of the lifeboat and his raft
for castaways who must share their lifeboats with large dangerous carnivores its advisable to establish a territory as your own
the following course of action is recommended
step one choose a day when waves are moderate but regular
step two with the lifeboat facing into the waves making the ride as comfortable as possible blow your whistle soothingly
step three turn the lifeboat sideways to the waves accompanied by harsh aggressive use of the whistle
with sufficient repetition the animal will associate the sound of the whistle with the discomfort of seasickness
similar methods have long been used by circus trainers though they generally lack access to rough seas
he reels in this line turning the boat sideways to the waves
the rocking increases
pi blows the whistle several times harshly warning signal as the rocking increases
from within the boat he hears the tiger groan
he grabs the original lifeline that connects the raft to the boat and hauls himself in
pi grins spits out the whistle
a ringmasters call let the trumpets blare let the drum rolls begin
prepare to be amazed
here it is for your enjoyment and instruction the show youve been waiting for all your life will soon begin
are you ready for the miracle of it
well then i give to you
pi lets go of the second line raising his hand with a flourish
the astounding bengal tiger
he pulls the raft next to the tarp end of the lifeboat
the tiger crawls out from under the tarp violently ill
rocking the boat hello richard parker
sorry about the choppy ride
pi pulls himself onto the bow
richard parker tries to lift his head then groans giving it up
pi lifts the whistle to his mouth and blows it repeatedly as he advances to the front edge of the tarp opens his fly and pisses in a straight line
across the midpoint of the boat
pointing he blows his whistle you understand
he steps back to observe the effect of this provocation on the seasick tiger
richard parker staggers to the edge of the tarp
he takes a deep sniff and winces groaning his tongue hanging out in distaste
the tiger turns away from pi facing the stern
pi thinks the battle is won until the tiger lifts his tail and sprays him with a tremendous burst of urine
step four disregard steps one through three
pi pulls in the solar still
pi bends down to suck fresh water from the straw that protrudes from a water still delighted to discover that it works
he carefully pours some of the water into a can for himself then pours the rest into a bucket
pi pulls himself up to the bow of the lifeboat sets a bucket of water in the boat and blows his whistle
richard parker sticks his head out from under the tarp
here richard parker
ive got some water for you
pi blows the whistle once more casting the raft adrift again
richard parker sniffs then begins lapping greedily at the water
insert of pi writing in manual text on page reflects pis accompanying v
in the zoo we fed our tigers an average of five kilos of meat a day
richard parker will be getting hungry soon
pi chews for a moment then spits out a blob of biscuit and presses the food ball onto his hook savoring the crumbs that remain in his mouth
he tosses the hook and biscuit onto the water the hook sinks leaving the crumble of biscuit floating uselessly on the surface
pi watches helplessly as fish rise to the surface to nibble at the soggy crumbs
tigers are powerful swimmers and if he gets hungry enough im afraid the little bit of water between us wont be any protection
i need to find a way to feed him
god made tigers carnivores so i must learn to catch fish
if i dont im afraid his last meal will be a skinny vegetarian boy
pi thinks a moment
he takes off one of his shoes using the knife to cut a sliver of leather off the side
he presses the hook through the leather and tosses it in the water
pi pulls in his fishing line the leather is gone
pi has cut his shoe into a dozen bits of leather and tried fishing several times always with the same result
richard parker watching mops at his jaw to wipe away drool hes clearly getting hungry
pi still fishes with no success
richard parker stares in the water at the dorado
he leans over the side of the boat pawing hungrily at the surface as fish streak past but the fish elude him
richard parker leans out further striking with both paws and finally jumps in altogether
richard parker strikes and splashes as fish streak past
pi grins at the tigers predicament but the moment richard parker realizes he cant climb back aboard he begins swimming toward the raft
pi snaps to recognizing the danger hes in
he reels the raft over to the lifeboat practically leaping onto the bow
as he hauls the raft aboard richard parker manages to catch the netting on the raft with one paw
pi leans back against an oar with all his weight trying to lever the raft aboard the weight of the tiger tips the entire bow lower in the water
pi is about to lose the struggle when the tigers claw rips through the netting and the lifeboat springs back up in the water the momentum flips the raft up
onto the boat
pi turns watching as richard parker swims up behind him alongside the bow
he digs into the supply box and rises with a hatchet in his hand crossing to stand over the tiger and blowing the whistle threateningly
pi pumps the axe a few times but cannot bring himself to kill the tiger
richard parker stares up at pi a long moment then paddles to the stern trying once again to pull himself aboard at the other end of the boat
what am i doing
pi kicks at the side of the boat in frustration and is surprised to hear a metal clunk
he finds a rectangular aluminum air box used for bouyancy pi then pulls the tarp back fully for the first time and examines the contents below
as he removes one of the floorboard panels imagining new uses for the wooden slats he hears richard parker scratching at the hull of the boat
wait im thinking
pi has tied a bunch of the flotation boxes to his raft and loaded it with all the provisions from the lifeboat
he points a flashlight beam over the side at the exhausted richard parker the tigers face and whiskers just above the surface of the water scratching at the side of
pi backs to the other end of the boat pushing his raft into the water with one hand as he rocks the boat to help richard parker climb in
the moment the tiger is aboard pi climbs onto the raft and pushes off retreating to safety blowing the whistle to remind richard parker whos in command
as he floats away pi collapses exhausted on the raft
pi goes through the supplies listed in his survival guide matching supplies to the pile of booty hes just retrieved from the lifeboat
cans of water
pi removes all of the lifejackets from under the life ring stacking them onto his latest raft structure
the empty banana netting now drapes beneath the raft pi notices that dorado are attracted to the net and gets an idea
one of the dorados gets very close to the net pi realizes his opportunity
he hauls in the netting and wrestles the dorado onto the raft flailing against the creatures strength and throwing his full weight onto the creature to keep it from sliding
back into the ocean riding it like a bucking bronco
pi grabs a hatchet from the raft and strikes the fish over and over again
as the fish begins to die it flashes all kinds of colors in rapid succession blue green red gold and violet flicker and shimmer neon like on its surface
pi starts back watching this colorful display in terrified wonder
finally the fish ebbs to grey lifeless
pi is devastated
he weeps bringing his hands together pressing them against his forehead murmuring a prayer to himself and bowing over the dead fish in abject grief
thank you lord vishnu
thank you for coming in the form of a fish and saving our lives
pi reels himself over to the lifeboat
he moves around to the side of the boat grabs the dorado by the tail and throws the entire fish over the side and into the stern
it lands with a thud and from somewhere inside the boat richard parker lets out a grunt of surprise
after a moment pi hears the wet mashing noises of the tiger devouring the fish
as pi pushes away from the lifeboat he puts the whistle in his mouth blowing a few sharp blasts to remind richard parker whos in charge
a full moon
all around the raft the green surface of the water glows with millions of flecks of glowing plankton and beneath the surface fish swim past at multiple depths and in
pi brushes his fingers over the surface of the water
the surface ripples where he touched it the plankton glowing more brightly the effect moving outward and downward through the water an ever expanding ring
pi hears a faint rapid succession of blows
he peers into the encroaching darkness but can see nothing
richard parker is nowhere to be seen
the blows stop and pi returns his attention to the light show below
pi senses movement deep within the water a cone of rushing energy pressing up toward the luminescent surface
suddenly the glowing silhouette of a huge creature wrapped in phosphorescent plankton a humpback whale streaks to the surface nearby its mouth gaping
fifty feet in length it thrusts itself up into the air
pi barely has time to react gripping the raft and holding on for his life as the whale comes crashing back down into the water
the animal slips back into the ocean creating a wave that sends the raft swirling across the waters surface submerging for a moment then bouncing off the side of the
pis neatly stacked water cans and biscuits tumble over the side of the raft and into the ocean
the whale disappears into the night leaving pi open mouthed and shaken
of course i brought all the biscuits and water on the raft with me to keep them safe
a calm day gentle waves
afternoon the sun beating down
pi wears his shirt wrapped around his head to hold off the heat
hunger can change everything you ever thought you knew about yourself
pi uses his knife to cut another scratch into the hull
there are scratches on the side of the lifeboat
he glances down staring longingly at the fish that swim just beneath the raft then looks across the lifeboat where the gaff lies hooked in the tarp close to the
tigers end of the boat
richard parker is nowhere to be seen
pi reaches out with the boat hook to try to snag the gaff but it is hooked deeply into the tarp
he lays the boat hook on the tarp and climbs aboard crawling forward to free the gaff
as he wiggles the hook free richard parkers head pops out from beneath the tarp only a few feet away
pis winces prepared for an attack
in an instant hes struck hard across the face a stunning blow that sends him backward onto the tarp
pi opens one eye
richard parker hasnt moved
pi looks down a slender grey blue fish with wings is flopping about on the tarp
pi has been hit by a flying fish
richard parker has seen the flying fish as well
he rises to his haunches
pi grabs the flying fish and tosses it to richard parker
here its yours
the tiger stands jaws opening in anticipation
and then the fish extends its wings veering at the last second and dropping into the water
richard parker tries to bat the fish down but its too quick for him
the tiger turns back toward pi with a questioning glare
the air around the boat whirs to life as they are struck from all directions by a school of flying fish that descends upon them like a swarm of locusts
some sail clear over the boat a number crash into the side
other less fortunate fish land in the boat where they start a racket of flapping and flailing
pi yelps in anguish as he is struck repeatedly
the school of fish is being pursued through the ocean by tuna
it is a feeding frenzy the ocean boils with jumping fish and snapping jaws
richard parker becomes totally absorbed in the kill leaping blocking and batting down as many of the fish as he can
a fat three foot long yellowfin tuna lands onboard cracking hard against the center bench and falling stunned and twitching into the boat
pi sees richard parkers head swivel in his direction
in a moment of insanity brought on by hunger pi reaches back and grabs the boat hook from the tarp shoving it aggressively into the tigers face just as richard
parker launches forward
the boat hook catches richard parker square in the mouth the tiger staggers back in shock and growls in outrage
pi rises up to his full height staring directly into the tigers eyes and shouting in fury his gaze wide his posture defiant
boy and tiger face off for several seconds both panting neither blinking nor showing fear as the rain of fish gradually slows around them
richard parker turns his focus from pi and takes in the situation around him
realizing that he stands up to his knees in a pile of flying fish he turns his attention to a more convenient meal
pi uses the gaff to snag the tuna shoving it to the farthest edge of the bow
as he rises late afternoon light casts golden flames across the surface of the water throwing pi into backlight
pi picks up the boat hook and turns to face richard parker
pi takes a small piece of tuna and gingerly raises it to his lips tasting flesh for the first time
a pause as he savors the taste considering
and then hunger takes him over
he grabs at the tuna stuffing pieces into his mouth devouring it
pi uses a bandage from the first aid kit to wrap a cut on his leg
as he works he glances back toward the boat deep in contemplation
i cant risk my life every time i have to climb onto the boat for supplies
its time to settle this
if were going to live together we have to learn to communicate
pi reaches into the stern prying loose a seven foot strip of wooden molding that lines the front edge of the seats
maybe richard parker cannot be tamed but with gods will he can be trained
pi works intently with his knife whittling the strip of molding into a long tapered wand with a handgrip on one end
pi crosses the tarp approaching richard parker with his new training stick
the tiger backs off as pi approaches curious and annoyed
pi uses the stick to probe into the tigers territory testing his limits richard parker gets angry batting at the stick
pi looks away tries again then turns to face richard parker who growls angry and begins batting at the stick
pi gives the tiger a stern glare
rp stops stares back then backs off
pi reaches into a pouch behind his back taking out a piece of fish
he places it on the end of the stick and reaches out offering it to richard parker who sniffs the air
pi puts the fish on the bench
richard parker eats the fish then backs up growing calmer
pi takes out another fish reaches out to tap the bench then tosses the fish on the bench
richard parker takes the fish eats
pi tosses the next piece near the edge of the tarp and taps encouraging richard parker to follow his direction
go richard parker
go on home ill leave you alone
ill respect that
richard parker stares at pi
pi raises his arms and yells chasing richard parker around the bench and under the tarp
pi sits the battle over
the sun is high
pi raises the adjustable canopy he has rigged on his raft and sits beneath it
he feels the wind on his face and watches richard parker lounge in the stern of the lifeboat
pi smiles for a moment genuinely happy
he uses his knife to carefully sharpen his pencil then begins writing in the margins of his survival manual which are covered with journal entries
life is good montage pis raft has transformed again
fish strips dry on lines he has fashioned new tools rigged an elaborate water collection system out of turtle shells and a collapsible shade umbrella
pi trims his fingernails a fish bone toothpick in his mouth
i never thought a small piece of shade could bring me so much happiness
that a pile of tools a bucket a knife a pencil might become my greatest treasures
or that knowing richard parker was here might ever bring me peace
in times like these i remember that he has as little experience of the real world as i do
we were both raised in a zoo by the same master
now weve been orphaned left to face our ultimate master together
without richard parker i would have died by now
my fear of him keeps me alert
tending to his needs gives my life purpose
a school of dolphins hundreds of them pass in the distance the blue sea roiling
dolphins richard parker
just beyond the school of dolphin something else catches pis attention on the horizon a freighter much like the tsimtsum is within a few miles of their position
pi scrambles to the storage locker pulling out the flare gun
he loads and fires the flare arcs high up into the air a miniature white star leaving a bright trail of fire and smoke as it falls to the earth
its grown noticeably darker
the freighter is far off now
it is late now
pi loads the last flare into his gun and raises it into the air then stops
the freighter now a fleck on the horizon hasnt seen them
pi watches as the dark form of the boat sinks from view
pi fires one last time staring up at the archways of smoke and the darkening sky
pi lowers the flare gun
richard parker yawns and turns away
above all dont lose hope
the flare burns a hole into the night
high angle book cover shot looking down on the boat adrift in the middle of the ocean
pi lies curled on the tarp in the bow richard parker lies in the stern
beneath the boat the ocean swirls with traffic including an enormous whale shark
it passes beneath the boat the creatures form blotting out the depths
a series of shots to show that pi has grown gaunt his eyes wild from exhaustion and endless solitude
the tarp has faded the paint on the boat has become sun bleached and weather beaten
pis hair has grown long his skin has darkened from olive caramel to cocoa
the shirt has begun to take on a look of thread worn transparency
he taps on the aluminum hull of the boat with his thumb in time with his recitation
richard parker gazes into the distance pi stares intently at the tiger
what are you looking at
what do you see
the tiger turns and looks over the side of the boat into the water pi rises and looks over the side as well staring into the depths
rps pov starting on his own reflection in the water and traveling downward through schools of darting tuna squid and lantern fish past fleeting memories of a storm and zoo
animals struggling to survive in churning waters and into the darkest recesses of the sea pi finding a broken ship and memories of a former life lying dormant on the ocean floor
out of pov richard parker looks over at pi as he gazes into the water
cut to an extremely wide shot of the boat floating in a sea of stars
words are all i have left to hang onto
pis fingers tremble as he writes in his manual the tiny cramped letters barely legible every white surface of the page covered
everything mixed up fragmented
cant tell daydreams night dreams from reality anym the lead in his tiny stub of a pencil runs out worn to a nub of wood
pi slowly puts down his pencil brooding
pi lies on the tarp his position nearly unchanged beating a drum rhythm on the hull a wreck of conflicted thoughts and frayed nerves
we hear a distant rumble of thunder
pi raises his head
dark thunderclouds rise up over the horizon blackening the heavens
another rumble of thunder this one closer
storm richard parker
pi takes down the canopy on the raft
pi begins quickly stowing his gear in the storage bench beneath the tarp
richard parker flees to the safety of his den under the tarp
as pi stows gear he remembers his manual and takes it out from his waistband
the storm front sweeps across the ocean in a squall line high winds and rain striking pi and the lifeboat with tremendous force
the manual slips from his hands and pi is knocked off his feet and into the water
he lifts his head out of the water in time to watch the manual flying off into the storm
the manual is gone
pi ties himself to the lifeboat with a rope from the raft
a stunning display of clouds and lightning fills the sky as pi looks on in awe
the sky lights up a vivid white splinter of lightning crashing down from the sky puncturing the water near the lifeboat
the water is shot through with what looks like the white roots of an enormous celestial tree the clap of thunder is tremendous
praise be to god lord of all worlds the compassionate the merciful
a wave washes pi off of the tarp and onto the floor of the boat
pi climbs onto the bench
he looks up in wonder at the sky overwhelmed by the magnificence of the roiling clouds
where are you richard parker
you have to see this
another angle he begins unbuttoning the tarp calling excitedly to richard parker
come out richard parker
come see the hand of god
pi continues to unfasten the tarp
dont hide yourself
hes come to us
its a miracle
a huge wave envelopes the lifeboat submerging the craft completely and then the boat pops to the surface like a cork
pi resumes opening the tarp
he tears it aside exposing the terrified animal to the storm
the sky lights up all around them
the tiger begins roaring pawing at the air eyes wide crazed with fear
pi turns to face the storm
a wave washes pi overboard and the raft comes crashing down on top of the lifeboat then slides away
pi climbs back on board
he lies on the bench coming to his senses realizing the extent of the danger they face
he sees richard parker cowering miserably at the stern
im sorry richard parker
pi crawls to the bow in time to see the raft no longer tied to the lifeboat drifting away
pounded by rain and surf he works his way around the edge of the boat re hooking the tarp to tarp hooks
with only four left unfastened along one side he pulls himself under the tarp
thunder rain and surf hammer the tarp from above pi pulls himself under the tarp
richard parkers grunts and labored breathing can be heard but man and beast are only fully visible when lightning strikes pi trying to stay as far away from the tiger
as he can manage
before long the boat is tossing pi and the tiger as though in a washing machine the two helplessly colliding with one another pi choking as water splashes in
pi wakes in the sloshing water under the tarp
sunlight filters in from above
the storm has passed
richard parker lies listlessly in the side bench
pi climbs out of the waterlogged hull
a double rainbow pierces majestic clouds the sun breaking through
the gentle sound of water lapping at the side of the lifeboat the breeze rattling the tarp
time has passed
life on the boat has grown tougher for pi his supplies more meager since the raft was lost
pi lies in the bow exhausted delirious
he pulls himself upright takes a drink of water and looks around confused
richard parker lies in the stern of the boat severely emaciated his coat dull his eyes clouded
shivering pi uses the last of his strength to drag himself over to the tiger
the animals body is curled his tail flat
some of his fur has fallen away from his shoulders and haunches
hes a skeleton in an oversized bag of fur
pi reaches out to place a hand on the tiger
he gently touches him on one spot
were dying richard parker
pi sits and places the tigers head on his lap
amma appa ravi im happy im going to see you soon
pause can you feel the rain
richard parker raises his head slightly his tail twitches
god thank you for giving me my life
im ready now
pi lies unconscious in the bow of the lifeboat
waves lap at the sides of the boat which presses against the shore of an island
a gust of wind blows across pis face tousling his hair
pi gradually opens his eyes
he tips his head back
pis pov above and behind him the tops of trees
pi turns looking at the island amazed
the trees have a pale bark with an amazing profusion of leaves their color burning with a neon like intensity
there is no sand instead the ground is an intricate tightly webbed mass of tube shaped seaweed about two fingers in diameter
pi turns to look back to the stern he calls under the tarp
pi rises stepping out of the boat
the seaweed is rubbery uncertain ground
his legs are wobbly
he hooks the gaff on a root and falls to the ground
pi tears up a piece of the seaweed and examines it
he takes an experimental bite
soon hes grabbing handfuls of the seaweed eating as fast as he can
pi climbs the ridge on unsteady legs
a forest comes into view with nearly symmetrical ponds dotting the island here and there many of them reaching feet in diameter
half the island seems to be covered with meerkats thousands of them standing together in groups all over the island
the moment the first of the meerkats notices pi it turns and stands on its hind legs and the others immediately follow suit
pi walks slowly forward taking in the meerkats and the island
gradually the meerkats return to all fours their squeaking and barking noises coming and going in waves throughout the herd
they pay him so little attention that pi has to shove them aside with his legs in order to walk
go on move
pi walks beyond the throng of meerkats toward a pond pausing to examine the fish bones that litter the edge of one of the ponds
the edge is steep he gets too close slips down the side and into the water
pi tastes the water
he begins a gentle blissful breaststroke across the pond
pi hears a commotion
he lifts himself up to peer over at the meerkats
in the distance richard parker blazes a trail through the meerkats catching pinning and eating as many as he can
pi smiles watching the tiger
pi sits cradled in a nest of branches rigging a hammock
as the last rays of the sun disappear he hears a commotion below on the island and pushes aside branches to see better
the meerkats are abandoning the ponds scurrying up onto land and running for the forest their collective stampede noisier than a herd of elephants
richard parker in the meantime runs for the shoreline scrambling down the ridge as fast as possible and leaping into the lifeboat
the trunk beneath pi is swarmed as meerkats settle upon all the branches in the tree
several invade pis hammock sitting on him climbing over him making themselves comfortable at his expense
hey get away
this is my bed
pi shoves them off as best he can and settles in for the night
pi sleeps nestled in the branches of the tree
meerkats snore at least one of them in the branches beneath pi does
pi wakes up staring grumpily into the darkness at the noisy offender
he is amazed to discover that what he can see of the island from his perch is bioluminescent
the leaves of the tree around him and the seaweed below all glow in gentle greens while the ponds beneath seem to shimmer like liquid silver it is a scene
at once beautiful and threatening
pi hears a burbling noise coming from the pond at the center of the tree
he looks down fish bubble to the surface
one of the larger fish writhes in agony at the surface before falling still along with the others
pi watches as the water below begins churning with the bodies of the dead fish the surface of the water aswirl with the flash of fins then gradually the fish
begin to disappear as though slowly dissolving in the water
pi stares at the mysterious pool then looks out over the island to where the lifeboat is anchored along shore richard parker is visible sitting in the boat staring up
at the island
close on richard parker staring into the night
wide angle looking over the tigers shoulder taking in the entire island
from this distance it looks and sounds as though the island is gently expanding and contracting with the tides
as though it is breathing
pi notices fruit growing on one of the branches above his head
he looks around at the rest of the tree but the fruit only seems to grow along the one branch
pi plucks one of the fruits and examines it
each stem that he pulls causes a leaf to peel off
he reaches the center of the ball peeling back the last of the leaves to reveal a tooth
it was human tooth
dont you see the island was carnivorous
a venus flytrap
yes the whole island the plants the water in those pools the very ground itself
during the day those pools held fresh water but at night some chemical process turned the water in those pools into acid acid that dissolved those fish that sent the
meerkats scurrying into the trees and richard parker running to the boat
but where did the tooth come from
years ago some poor fellow just like me must have found himself stranded on that island
and like me he thought he might stay there forever
but all that the island gave him by day it took away again by night
to think how many hours spent with only meerkats for company
how much loneliness taken on
all i know is that eventually he died and the island digested him leaving behind only his teeth
i saw how my life would end if i stayed on that island
alone and forgotten
i had to go back to the world or die trying
pi loads the boat with water and meerkats the tarp is piled high with roots and seaweed
i spent the next day preparing the boat
i filled my stores with fresh water ate seaweed until my stomach could take no more and brought as many meerkats as i could fit into the storage locker for
i couldnt leave without him of course it would mean killing him
and so i waited for his return
i knew he wouldnt be late
he blows his whistle calling richard parker runs down the ridge and jumps into the stern
pi climbs aboard and shoves off
pi and the tiger watch as the island recedes into the distance lit by the late afternoon sun
no one has ever seen that floating island since you wont read about those trees in any nature book
and yet if i hadnt found those shores i would have died
and if i hadnt discovered that tooth i would have been lost alone forever
even when god seemed to have abandoned me he was watching
even when he seemed indifferent to my suffering he was watching
and when i was beyond all hope of saving he gave me rest then gave me a sign to continue my journey
pi leans over the side of the lifeboat
he falls overboard
we follow him underwater his feet hit a sandy bottom
by the time we reached the mexican shore i was afraid to let go of the boat
my strength was gone
i was so weak
i was afraid that in two feet of water so close to deliverance i would drown
i struggled to shore and fell upon the sand
it was warm and soft like pressing my face against the cheek of god
and somewhere two eyes were smiling at having me there
an empty coastline nothing but sand rocks and jungle
pi struggles to bring the lifeboat ashore
richard parker is hiding under the tarp nowhere to be seen
pi pulls the painter line until the boat is on the beach then collapses on the sand
pi collapses on the beach
he hears richard parker coming a moment before he sees him pi turns looking up as the tiger jumps over the boy stretching in the air above him and landing
in the water ahead of him
i was so spent i couldnt move
and so richard parker went ahead of me
richard parker walks along the beach his gait clumsy and uncoordinated from so much time spent at sea
he stretched his legs and walked along the shore
richard parker stops staring ahead into the forest his back to the boy
pi watches the tiger from behind richard parkers ribs gently rising and falling as he smells the jungle air
at the edge of the jungle he stopped
i was certain he was going to look back at me flatten his ears to his head growl that hed bring our relationship to an end in some way
but he just stared ahead into the jungle
on adult pi alone and then richard parker my fierce companion the terrible one who kept me alive disappeared forever from my life
pi lies on the sand a few yards from the water
a group of six mexican locals hurry down the beach to him
after a few hours a member of my own species found me
he left and returned with a group who carried me away
pi sobs uncontrollably as they carry him to safety
i wept like a child not because i was overwhelmed at having survived although i was
i was weeping because richard parker left me so
it broke my heart
it is near sunset the light from the windows casting theroom in a golden hue the same lighting we have just seen as pi was leaving the island
you know my father was right
richard parker never saw me as his friend
after all wed been through he didnt even look back
but i have to believe that there was more in his eyes than my own reflection staring back at me
i know i felt it even if i cant prove it
i just wish
you know ive left so much behind
my family the zoo anandi india i suppose in the end the whole of life becomes an act of letting go
but what always hurts the most is not taking the moment to say goodbye
i was never able to thank my father for all i learned from him to tell him that without his lessons i would never have survived
and i know hes a tiger but i wish id said its over
thank you for saving my life
i love you richard parker
you will always be with me
may god be with you
the writer shakes his head astonished
i dont know what to say
hard to believe isnt it
a pause as the writer decides how to respond
it is a lot to take in to figure out what it all means
if it happened it happened
why should it have to mean anything
well some of it is pretty incredible
pi nods a half smile then rises crossing to the bookshelf
i was the only one who survived the shipwreck so the japanese shipping company sent two men to talk to me in the mexican hospital where i was recovering
i still have a copy of their report
pi takes a tattered notebook out of the bookcase
they had insurance claims to settle and they wanted to find out why the ship sank
they didnt believe me either
pi hands the notebook to the writer
on top there is a newspaper article with the headline boy rescued days in the pacific
the writer unclips the article revealing the insurance report beneath
we hear okamotos first line over the report
thousands of meerkats
on a floating carnivorous island
and no one has ever seen it
just like i told you
bananas dont float
in japanese why are you talking about bananas
you said the orangutan floated to you on a bundle of bananas
but bananas dont float
in japanese are you sure about that
of course they do
try it for yourself
in any case we are not here to talk about bananas or meerkats
ive just told you a long story
im very tired
were here because a japanese cargo ship sank in the pacific
something i never forget
i lost my whole family
in japanese get him some water
in english we dont mean to push you
and you have our deepest sympathies
but weve come a long way
and were no closer to understanding why the ship sank
because i dont know
i was asleep
something woke me up
it may have been an explosion i cant be sure
and then the ship sank
what else do you want from me
a story that wont make us look like fools
we need a simpler story for our report
one our company can understand
a story we can all believe
chiba gives pi a glass of water
a story without things you never seen before
without animals or islands
so what did you do
i told him another story
four of us survived
four of us survived
the cook and the sailor were already onboard
the cook threw me a lifebuoy and pulled me aboard
mother held onto some bananas and made it to the lifeboat
the cook the cook was a disgusting man
he ate a rat
we had food enough for weeks but he found the rat in the first few days and he killed it and dried it in the sun and ate it
he was such a brute that man
but he was resourceful
it was his idea to build the raft to catch fish
we would have died in those first few days without him
the sailor was the same man who brought rice with gravy the buddhist
we didnt understand much of what he said only that he was suffering
i can still hear him the happy buddhist who only ate rice with gravy
he had broken his leg horribly in the fall
we tried to set it as best we could but the leg became infected and the cook told us we had to do something or hed die
the cook said hed do it but mother and i had to hold the man down
and i believed him we needed to do it
i kept saying im sorry im sorry but he just kept
looking at me his eyes so
ill never understand the point of that mans suffering
we didnt save him of course
the morning after the cook caught his first dorado and i didnt understand what hed done at first but mother did and id never seen her so angry
stop whining and be happy he said
we need more food or well die
that was the whole point
what was the point
you let that poor boy die in order to get bait
the cook got furious
he started towards her with his fists raised and mother slapped him hard right across the face
i was stunned
i thought he was going to kill her right then
but he didnt
the cook didnt stop at bait either no
the sailor he went the same way the rat went the cook was a resourceful man
it was a week later that he
because of me
because i couldnt hold onto a stupid turtle
it slipped out of my hands and swam away and the cook came up and punched me on the side of the head and my teeth clacked and i saw
i thought he was going to hit me again but then mother started pounding on him with her fists and screaming monster
she yelled at me to go to the raft nee poda
i thought she was coming with me or id never have
i dont know why i didnt make her go first
i think about that every day
i jumped over and turned back just as the knife came out
there wasnt anything i could do i couldnt look away
he threw her body overboard
then the sharks came
i saw what they
the next day i killed him
he didnt even fight back
he knew he had gone too far even by his standards
hed left the knife out on the bench
and i did to him what he did to the sailor
he was such an evil man but worse still he brought the evil out in me
i have to live with that
i was alone in a lifeboat drifting across the pacific ocean
and i survived
after that no more questions
the investigators didnt seem to like the story exactly but they thanked me they wished me well and they left
the writer speaks his thoughts aloud as the realization strikes
both the zebra and the sailor broke their leg
and the hyena killed the zebra and the orangutan
the hyena is the cook
and the sailor is the zebra mother is the orangutan
can i ask you something
ive told you two stories about what happened out on the ocean
neither explains what caused the sinking of the ship and no one can prove which story is true and which is not
in both stories the ship sinks my family dies and i suffer
so which story do you prefer
the story with the tiger
thats the better story
heartfelt thank you
and so it goes with god
he looks up
mamaji was right
it is an amazing story
will you really let me write it
isnt that why mamaji sent you here after all
they hear a car pulling into the alleyway alongside the house
my wife is here
would you like to stay for dinner
shes an incredible cook
i didnt know you had a wife
and a cat and two children
so your story does have a happy ending
well thats up to you
the storys yours now
the writer smiles
outside car doors slam we hear voices as pis wife and children cross around to the front
pi rises and moves to the door
the writer glances one final time at the report
he flips the page and hesitates reading the last few lines aloud
patels is an astounding story of courage and endurance unparalleled in the history of shipwrecks
very few castaways can claim to have survived so long at sea and none in the company of
he looks up at pi an adult bengal tiger
off we have a guest
let me introduce you
the writer stands and faces pi
we see his pov on pi holding his daughter in arms surrounded by his family smiling
young pis pov of richard parker from behind as he stares into the jungle the tigers ribs gently rising and falling as he smells the jungle air and then he
walks forward and disappears into the swaying trees
the moment that the tiger is out of view all the color drains out of pis world his view of the trees loses all dimension and fades to black and
white as we
