mm color anamorphic now camera is in the midst of a large forrest fire
camera three firemen battling the flames
camera pushes in on them as they scream and shout directions at each other as reported in the reno gazzette june of there is the story of a fire the
trees are on fire
the water that it took to contain the fire dropped from a fire department air tanker
camera pushes in towards four firefighters as they survey the area
the fire is out and they are walking through
the main firefighter steps into a close up and looks and a scuba diver named delmer darion
camera dollies in and tilts up towards the top of the tree to reveal there is a man in scuba gear hanging high in the tree
he is wearing his goggles and his tanks and his wet suit
what the fuck is that
he still has his mask and mouthpiece
camera looks down on a blackjack game boom down and tilt up to reveal delmer darion s employee of the peppermill hotel and casino reno nevada
engaged as a blackjack dealer camera pushes in towards delmer as he leaves for the nght his uniform draped on a hanger over his shoulder he nods and motions two
fingers to his fellow workers who say so longer
note he has a bandage over his forehead
well liked and well regarded as a physical recreational and sporting sort delmers true passion was for the lake delmer splashes in and comes down towards the camera
sound drops out becomes very quiet
the fire department air tanker comes flying in heading towards the lake coming directly at camera
silent and peaceful
overhead angle looks down on the calm lake
beat then fulling its body full of water from the lake
it enters camera rt
and exits camera lft
angle the air tanker
it heads off full of water towards the raging forrest fire in the distance
as reported by the coroner delmer died of a heart attack somewhere between the lake and the tree
but most curious side note is the suicide the next day of craig hansen establishing shot
x camera pushes in super quick towards a man named craig hansen s he shoves a rifle under his chin and pulls the trigger blood and brains splatter the ceiling
hansen flying the plane
as he moves towards the lake
volunteer firefighter estranged father of four and a poor tendency to drink mr
hansen was the pilot of the plane that quite accidentally lifted delmer darion out of the water quick flashback to the footage of the plane lifting the water from the
lake sound carries over
the blackjack table where delmer is dealing
dolly around to reveal a drunk and obnoxious craig hansen screaming about the cards hes been dealt and taunting delmer added to this mr
hansens tortured life met before with delmer darion just two nights previous hansen spits and punches at delmer darions face for dealing the cards hes been dealt
security guards attack and pull him to the ground
craig hansen reading the paper looking at the cover story that has a photo of delmer darion
hes crying and mumbling to himself oh god
the weight of the guilt and the measure of coincidence so large craig hansen took his life
replay of craig hansens suicide except this time right before he blows his head off we hear him say through tears forgive me
back to the fight delmer and craig hansen are having camera dollies in quick towards delmer on the ground with blood coming from his nose
and i am trying to think this was all only a matter of chance
it reads welcome
aafs awards dinner and reception walnut room pm camera pushes in following two guests through some double doors and reveals the dinner reception
camera pushes in quick then blends to fps on a man in glasses donald harper forensic scientist as he speaks into the microphone
the tale told at a awards dinner for the american association of forensic science by dr
donald harper president of the association began with a simple suicide attempt a seventeen year old kid sydney barringer steps up on to the roof of a nine story building
and looks down
seventeen year old sydney barringer
in the city of los angeles on march
camera dollies towards sydney landing in a close up of his feet on the ledge they wobble a bit he jumps disappears from frame
the following happens very quickly angle looking up towards the sky
sydney falls past camera
angle looking down towards the street
sydney continues to fall
angle a random window on the sixth floor of the building smashes
angle sydneys stomach
a bullet rips into it as he falls
blood splatters and his body flinches
angle looking up towards the sky
sydneys body and some shattered glass fall directly at the camera
which pulls back a little to reveal a safety net in the foreground
sydneys body falls limp into the net
the coroner ruled that the unsuccessful suicide had suddenly become a succesful homicide
to explain replay of shot
sydney steps up on the rooftop
camera pushes in towards him quickly this time moving into his coat pocket the suicide was confirmed by a note left in the breast pocket of sydney barringer camera catches
glimpses of the note im sorry
and in this time
so i will go
and be with god
at the same time young sydney stood on the ledge of this nine story building an argument swelled three stories below camera pushes in towards the door of room
we hear same screaming and yelling coming fram behind the door the neighbors heard as they usually did the arguing of the tenants an elderly couple early s are savagely
fighting and throwing things
the older man is backing away from the older woman who is coming at him with a shotgun
and it was not uncommon for them to threaten each other with a shotgun or one of the many handguns kept in the house put it down put that fuckin
thing down fay iii fucking tell you
ill shoot you in the face and end this argument and we see whos right and when the shotgun accidentaly went off sydney just happend to pass the older woman
stumbles a bit on some furniture and the shotgun goes off fires past the older mans head and smashes the window behind him sydney falls past and gets shot in the stomach then falls out of frame theyre oblivious to this you crazy fuckin bitch what are you doing
freeze frame on the two of them yelling and screaming added to this the two tenants turned out to be fay and arthur barringer
sydneys mother and sydneys father
camera moves through the scene as policeman and detectives question the older couple
neighbors and lookie loos around
when confronted with the charge which took some figuring out for the officers on the scene of the crime fay barringer swore that she did not know that the gun
i didnt know i didnt know she always threatens me with the gun but i dont keep it loaded and you didnt load the gun
why would i load the gun
camera moves through as officers are talking to and getting statements from various neighbors
camera closes in on an eight year old boy speaking with a detective
a young boy who lived in the building sometimes a vistor and friend to sydney barringer said that he had seen six days prior the loading of the shotgun the
detective turns his head and calls to another cmere a minute camera moves into a bedroom area where we see a figure from the back sitting on the bed it seems that the arguing and the fighting and all of the violence was far too much for sydney barringer and knowing his mother and fathers tendency to fight he decided to do something camera reveals that it is sydney barringer who is loading the shotgun the young boy is sitting nearby watching sydney mumble to himself as he loads shells into the shotgun
camera moves in on the young boy who looks into camera
he said he wanted them to kill each other that all they wanted to do was kill each other and he would help them if thats what they wanted to
do this is a wide angle replay of the whole event
we see the whole bui ding
sydney starts to jump and the film suddenly slows down
a diagram is made to reflect the narration
this is done like nfl coverage where the xs and os and arrows and lines are drawn to indicate placement and moves etc
an x appears on the top of the building over sydney
sydney barringer jumps from the ninth floor rooftop his parents argue three stories below an o is marked to indicate their position
image goes into motion with sydney jumping
an arrow is drawn that displays the path of his fall her accidental shotgun blast hits sydney in the stomach as he passes the arguing sixth floor window freeze frame
shows sydney hanging mid air the glass shattering and starting to fall to the ground an x marks the spot where he is hit
he is killed instantly but continues to fall only to find three stories below a safety net installed three days prior for a set of window washers that would have
broken his fall and saved his life if not for the hole in his stomach
a squiggly line with an arrow is drawn from sydney to the net to indicate the path unfreeze frame and watch sydney fall into the net camera moves in on
the parents then over to some detectives and officers who are making sense of this they nod to each other as if to say well we know what we have to do
so fay barringer was charged with the murder of her son and sydney barringer noted as an accomplice in his own death
camera moves towards the little eight year old boy as he watches the older couple cry and scream as detectives begin to cuff them and it is in the humble
opinion of this narrator that this is not just something that happened
this cannot be one of those things
this please cannot be that
and for what i would like to say i cant
this was not just a matter of chance
camera pushes in towards the mother as she screams and screams and the officers fight to regain control of her in the scuffle the apartment door is shut directly in
the face of the camera
these strange things happen all the time

earl gets hit with something and starts to moan a bit
sharp pain hitting him and he touches his hand to his face

phil leans in closer to earl

earl hallucinates a bit cries a little tries to form the sentences find him on the
his names frank mackey frank mackey
thats your son

hes hallucinating more now falls asleep a bit mumbling ifyougimmethat
i cant hold ontothis anymore
he gives phil make an imaginary object and falls asleep
stay with phil a moment as he turns his head looking around the house a moment looks back to earl
frank steps into a close up and holding a mic says respect the cock and tame the cunt boys
reverse that moment
the crowd of fifty guys who are taking the seduce and destroy seminar that frank is teaching today laugh and play along frank is on a slightly elevated stage
vbehind him a huge banner for seduce and destroy whose logo is a scared pussycat and a large wolf with a big buldge in his fur
it reads no pussy has nine lives
and you did hear me right
take it on head first with your skills at work and say no
you will not control me
you will not take my soul and you will not win this game
cause it is a game guys you wanna think its not go back to the schoolyard and have a crush on mary jane respect the cock you are embedding this
thought im in charge
im the one who says yes no now or here
sad but true
sad but true
and you wanna know what
it must be the way
the thing about chicks and the thing about this course that were going through today is how universal the whole thing is
i mean i wish i could sit here and say that its not because the reality if each chick had something new something really new that id never seen before
fuckin hell id be in the money
because id have to create a hundred new cassettes a hundred new books a hundred new seminars and hundred new videos just to deal with each and every situation a
chick could create but that is just not the case
they are universal
they are sheep
they are to be studied and watched they have patterns that must be stopped interupted and resisted
id be makin a fuckin butt load if they were actually as much of a challenge as they want you to think they are
reality they are all the same
each and every one of them
and once you learn these methods youre set
you dont have to come back
because all women are the same
end of discussion
sad but true
and anyone who wants to say that these methods we work by are unfair
yes they are
guilty as charged
and sos the world
its a harsh hard unfair place but its not gonna stop me from getting my fair shair of hair pie period
end of discussion
sliding doors open in the lobby and a young woman gwenovier s enters takes off her sunglasses and looks around

audience cheers but listen up that is not to say that we dont all need women as friends cause were gonna learn later on in chapter that having a couple
of chick friends laying around can come in real handy in setting jealousy traps
but well get to that
number one this is page in your booklets blue cover go to it and follow along with me
the guys flip open their little blue booklets and follow along
create a crisis simple and clean and if done properly can be quite effective in getting some bush
here we go set a date with your so called friend
lets say you make it
you call her on the phone camera dollies around a young girl s on the phone
that sounds like fun frank
i love seafood
frank on the phone
so ill see you about
bye bye cindy
he hangs up
camera hand held follows behind the girl as she walks from the kitchen to the front door shaking her head huffing and puffing
you wait until about nine oclock and you ring the doorbell
she opens the door and sees frank crying and hysterical
she opens it up pissed as hell but finds you sobbing your eyes out frank looks up at her and says i cant believe what happened
frank and the girl sit down on the couch together
you explain between sobs that you hit a dog on the way over to pick her up and you had to rush it to the animal hospital but by the
time you got there and its paw was sticking out
and it was too late
it was too late
she moves in and hugs him
frank is cracking himself up
i cant believe im telling you guys this but the truly terrifying part is that this works
any girl that calls herself your friend is not gonna let you be alone in a situation like that
technique staging a fight
this is not knock down drag out crying screaming yelling this is a simple direct and subtle way of planting confusion into a girls mind
remember we are using reinforcement technique g with these women
heres how the girl picks up her phone and presses some numbers
one day she calls you up on the phone
frank picks up the phone
im wondering if you wanna grab a bite and see a movie
you very directly say i dont think i have anything to say to you cindy
frank hangs up the phone
the girl gets the dial tone
she looks completely confused and hurt
frank speaking to the group let her wonder what she did wrong
camera does a slow dolly in
franks tone changes a bit gets darker this is the way
because they will always wonder what did i do
what could i have done different
how should i behave to get this back
and if they think that way then they are asking for you to hurt them and that is what you must do
that is what you must do which is punish them many many times over
camera pushes in as linda walks towards us down the same hallway we saw jimmy gator walking down earlier she heads into an office camera pushes in on linda as
she enters whips over to a receptionist who looks up mrs
partridge im here and i need to see him
quick shots get them in the room dr
landon s sits across from linda whos in semi hysterics pacing hes fucking dying hes dying as were sitting here and there isnt a fucking thing jesus how can you
tell me to calm down
i can help you through this the best i know how but there are certain things you are gonna have to be strong about and take care of now we
can go over them but i need to know that youre listening to me ok
i just i just i just im just in a fucking state i know hes going and its like i dont know how just tell me practical things what the
fuck do i do with his body
what happens when he dies
that next moment what
what do i do
well thats what hospice will take care of for you
they will send a nurse someone who can take care of all of that for you he has phil right now
phils one of the nurses from the service
if youre happy with phil taking care of him and helping you thats fine but contact hospice to arrange for the body you dont understand its more pain than before
and the fucking morphine pills arent working hes past two days its like he cant really swallow them and i dont know if theyre going down i cant see inside his mouth anymore im up all night staring at him and i dont think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts we can fix that because i can give you are you listening
im getting better
do you wanna sit down
i need to sit down
linda earl is not gonna make it
he is dying very very rapidly she breaks a bit more
now the thing here is making that experience as painless and easy as possible for him you understand
now you need to get in touch with hospice care because they can take care of all those practical things that youre asking me about they are who you call
when he dies
he writes a number on his bussiness card hands it over as they speak this is the number for hospice
as far as the morphine pills go there is something else to consider that can take the pain away that he is in there is a very strong and very
potent solution of liquid morphine
its a little bottle with an eye dropper and its easy to get in his mouth and drop on his tounge and it will certainly diminish the pain that he
is in but you have to realize that once you give it to him there really is no coming back i mean it will certainly cure his pain but he will float in and out of consciousness even worse than he is now linda
i mean any sign of the recognizable earl will pretty much go away how the fuck can i say anything to that i dont know what to say to that
the job here is to make him as comfortable as possible right now our job is to just try and make it as painless as possible
camera pushes into an extreme close up on dr
landons hands writing the perscription for the liquid morphine
hands it to linda

hold on him
i know this all seems silly
i know that maybe i sound ridiculous like maybe this is the scene of the movie where the guy is trying to get ahold of the long lost son but
this is that scene
i think they have those scenes in movies because theyre true because they really happen
and you gotta believe me this is really happening
i mean i can give you my phone number and you can call me back if you wanna check with whoever you can check this with but dont leave me
hanging on this please please

you grew up here in the valley like i said yeah and you went to van nuys high right
i dont how much i went but i was enrolled
i was such a loser back then
i was misguided pathetic i was very fat
not even close to what i am today
not the frank tj mackey youre eager to talk to because i was swimming in what was as opposed to i wanted where does that name come from
its not your given name right
my mothers name actually
youve done youre research
frank was my mothers father
i had trouble locating your school records at berkely and ucla
your name change they had no official enrollment oh yeah
no no no
they wouldnt they wouldnt
no no no
i wasnt officialy enrolled thats right
was that unclear
i wouldnt want that to be misunderstood my enrollment was totally unoffical because i was sadly unable to afford tuition up there
but there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes and theyre names are macready horn and langtree among others
i was completely independent financially and like i said one sad sack a shit
so what were looking at here is a true rags to riches story and i think thats what most people respond to in seduce and at the end of the
hey it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it its about finding what you can be in this world
controling it and saying i will take what is mine
you just happen to get a blow job out of it then hey what the fuck why not
camera pushes in on jimmy gator

volume maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that if its the middle of the day thats what i do just put it on two and a half and thats a good listening level alright
i see you like listenin to your music loud but hey forget about the neighbors you end up damaging your own ears ok

afraid to speak next thing you know im gettin a call on the radio i got a its not whats a
its where situations like these lead claudia unless you do something about it early if and when the police call and come for help

him continue to grab his crotch and make a face
ok ok here we go steeper questions bigger payoff individual challenges with musical and audio pockets no steal lock outs lets get it on in round two categories are frank
and gwenovier doing the telvision interview
camera dollies thats right thats right and what im saying that none of my competitors can say is this that there is no need for insight or understanding
things of the past
gone over done
do you realize how fucking miraculous this is
how fucking razor sharp and cutting edge and ahead of its time this concept is
im talking about eliminating insight and understanding as human values
god damn im good
there is no need for insight
there is no need for understanding
i have found a way to take any subjective human experience in other words all the terrible shit or all the great shit that youve had happen to you in
your life and quickly and easily transform it in the unconscious mind through the subtle and cunning use of language
the listener patient in other words the chick settles into a very light very delicate conversationally induced state not a trance mind you but a state
a state that is brand new
the systems state
what did i do
i realized that concept and put it into practical get my dick hard and fuck it use
im gonna build a state for the seducer and the seducee to live vote breath pay takes and party till dawn
im gonna teach methods of language that will help anyone get a piece of ass tit and tail lets talk about i just realized this is for television isnt it
i cant swear up and down like i just did
i can bleep it out
i warned you i get on a roll
lets talk more about your background muffy coffee
muffy moves to pour a cup gwen looks down at her clipboard then im confused about your past is the thing
is that still lingering
just to clarify so boring so useless i would just want to clear some things up muffy delivers coffee thank you muffy
funny thing is this is an important element of seduce and destory facing the past is an important way in not making progress thats something i tell my men over
and over this isnt meant and i try and teach the students to ask what is it in aid of
are you asking me that
well just trying to figure out who you are and how you might have become in aid of what
im saying frank in trying to figure out who you are theres a lot more important things id like to put myself into its all important not really
its not like im trying to attack you this is how you wanna spend the time then go go go youre gonna be surprised at what a waste it is
the most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me chapter three we talked earlier about your mother
and we talked about your father and his death
and i dont want to be challenging or defeatist here but i have to ask and i would want to clarify something something that i understand im not sure i
hear a question in there
do you remember a miss simms
i know alotta women and im sure she remembers me
from when you were a boy
she lived in tarzana
an old stomping ground is this the attack portion of the interview i figured this was coming sooner or later is the girl coming in for the kill
no this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question go ahead and waste your time
i was told that your mother died
that your mother died when you were young and thats what youve heard
i talked to miss simms
miss simms was your caretaker and neighbor after your mother died in
frank goes silent
in my research i have you listed as the only son of earl and lily partridge
beat and what i learned from mrs
simms is that your mother passed away in
beat see its my understanding that the information supplied by you and your company and answers to questions ive asked are incorrect frank
and if id like to get to the bottom of who you are and why you are then i think your family history youre accurate family history
well this seems important
frank lights his cigarette
camera zooms into cu
are you asking me a question
well i guess the question is this do you remember miss simms
jimmy asks questions
stanley is visibly uncomfortable kids adults id like you to put yourself at a picnic
place yourself there with your family and friends if youd like youll hear three musical notes and you are to tell me what it might represent that youd find at
a picnic the first three notes oc we hear three musical notes
the adults panel lights up todd answers well jimmy i know this i have perfect pitch you see and that would be a d e
and that would represent lemonade

camera pushes in on jimmy

how are you and the seven kids
as you probably heard by know we sure gave that pope a run for his money the adults buzz
jimmy looks to mim
well that would be general robert e
his wife mary park custiss
and he did have seven children and he would be talking about pope who he defeated at the battle of monasses camera pushes in on rick who sits back starting
to get real pissed that stanley isnt answering these questions
cmon cmon cmon snap out of it
camera moves from the audience over to the stage listening to another question that is spoken by the oc voice this time in french voice in french hello josephine im
speaking from egypt the adults buzz again and mim answers mim well that would be napoleon speaking to josephine
he stands off looking at the scoreboard as the adults have now pulled ahead by points
he mumbles and grumbles to himself
linda continued with the lawyer kligman
i dont want him to die i didnt love him when we met and ive done so many bad things to him that he doesnt know things i want to
confess to him but now i do i love him
i love him so much and i cant stand hes going

youre his lawyer our laywer there im his wife we are married
i broke the conract of marriage i fucking cheated on him many times over i sucked other mens cocks and fuck fuck fuck fuck
other things ive done
adultery isnt illegal its not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or linda
you dont have to change the will if what you want to do is get nothing you can renounce the will when its time
where will the money go
considering that theres no one else mentioned in the will
wed have to go to the laws of intestacy which is as if someone died without a will what does that mean
the money would go to frank
the court would put the money in the hands of a relative that cant happen
earl doesnt want him to have the money the things
unless frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary thats what will happen
this is so over the top and fucked up i can hardly stand it
linda you just have to take a moment and breath and one thing at a time shut the fuck up

earl begins to talk
directors note following is the story earl tells it is to be more broken and elliptical factoring in earls state of mind and health etc but heres the concept in
its entirety do you know lily

in school when youre years old
in school in six grade
and i saw her and i didnt go to that school
but we met
and my friend knew her
i would say whats that girl

oh shes a bad girl
she sleeps with guys
my friend would say this
but then sometime
i went to another school you see
when high school at the end whats that

she was fuckin
like a doll
and the hips
child bearing hips
but i didnt have sex with anyone you know
i was not
i couldnt do anything
always scared yknow
she had some boyfriends
they liked her yknow
but i didnt like that
i couldnt get over that i wasnt a man but she was a woman
ysee i didnt make her feel ok about that
i would say how many men you been with
she told me i couldnt take it
take that i wasnt a man
because if i hadnt had sex with women
like as many women as she had men
then i was weak
but i loved her
well of course i wanted to have sex with her
and i did and we were together
age twelve but then again
i didnt let her forget that i thought she was a bad
a slut i would call her and hit her
i hit her for what she did
but we married
lily and me and we married
but i cheated on her
over and over and over again
because i wanted to be a man and i couldnt let her be a woman
a smart free person who was something
my mind then so fuckin stupid so fuckin
jesus christ what would i think

for what ive done
shes my wife for thirty eight years
i went behind her
over and over

the regret you make is the something that you take
beat gimme a cigarettee
through the following phil tries to give earl a cigarette which earl cant get to his mouth but then mimes that hes smoking as he starts to get more and
more delusional etc
she had cancer
in her stomach and i didnt go anywhere with her
and i didnt do a god thing
for her and to help her
the beautiful beautiful bitch with perfect skin and child bearing hips and so soft
beat fading he liked her though he did his mom frank jack
he took care of her and she died
she didnt stick with him and he thinks and he hates me ok
thats then what you get
are you still walkin in that car
say it again
walking in the car
getthat on the tv
earl starts to break down in tears streaming out of his eyes his body isnt moving at all mistakes like this are not ok
sometimes you make some and ok
not sometimes to make other one

i loved lily
i cheated on her
for thirty five years
and i have this son
and she has cancer
and im not there

sometimes people need a little help
sometimes people need to be forgiven and sometimes they need to go to jail
and thats a very tricky thing on my part
making that call
the law is the law and heck if im gonna break it
but you can forgive someone
well thats the tough part
what do we forgive
tough part of the job
tough part of walking down the street

a song plays
for a very very long time she doesnt move until she looks up and sees someone enter her bedroom
a figure from the back enters frame and walks in and sits on the edge of the bed
from the back it is clear that its jim kurring
she tears a bit and looks at him
she turns her eyes from him and looks into the camera and smiles
