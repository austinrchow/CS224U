presents comes up
after a beat it is consumed by fire
it becomes an american flag burning in the street
effigies of jimmy carter and the deposed shah crowds chanting magbar carter
fists in the air
young men and women about men and women some with flak jackets about half the young women wear full chador
many wear plastic bibs with photographs of ayatollah khomeini
pasted to roosevelt gate photographs of students who were killed under the deposed shah of irans regime
signs in english u
return the shah justice for murder
a few iranian police attend more as bystanders than peacekeepers
a man frantically stabs an effigy of the shah
an iranian student films the scene with a super camera
from inside the embassy gates we can hear the noise of the protest
there are three primary buildings on campus the chancery the embassys main building the ambassadors residence and the consulate
we can see that the compound is securitized sand filled traps and steel bars on the windows of the consulate
now we see the pov through those steel bars
standing on a chair looking at the protest outside the gate is bob anders late s s a consular officer
carnivals bigger today
mark lijek a consular officer joins anders at the window
then in a famous piece of archive footage something simple happens
a young man in a sweater climbs the gate and makes it to the other side
and now we see the reverse of that famous shot
this isnt archive footage anymore
were looking at the pov of tom ahern the cia station chief here
from a pillbox on the embassy campus sgt
rocky sickmann a young marine can also see the protestors break across the lawn
into his radio fort apache is breached please advise the protest in front of the gate is getting rowdier its energy and numbers swelling
a group of students these more brisk organized all bearded and dressed in flak jackets push their way to the front of the protest women raise a banner
its a signal
as if on cue the iranian police move from the gates
a woman removes a large pair of bolt cutters from underneath her chador hands them to a bearded student who gets to work on the chains holding the gate when
one young man wearing a green military field jacket raises his fist we can see that he has a concealed pistol in his clothes
more students climbing the wall dropping the feet to the other side one after another
but a moment later no more climbing is required because the gate chain is cut and protestors flood through the embassy gates a human dam breaking mounting chaos in here
the nerve center of the embassy
everyone on a different phone
its like an emergency room where the patient is the whole building
ann swift deputy political officer has the phone by her ear trying to hear reports from d
there are hundreds of people out no thousands
there are mark lijek and bob anders look out windows nervous but not like the iranian visa applicants who are close to panic
are these supposed to be bulletproof
well theyve never been tested
six marines watch images from closed circuit television cameras on chunky s monitors
crowds of protestors from every part of the embassy campus
al golacinski chief of security for the embassy shouts into a radio
marines to number one fall protestors come running turning the corner to reach the building
they use bats and crowbars to smash the windows of the building
on the phone can we get some fucking police please
one by one the security monitors are going black or smashed
the marines stare
an iranian police captain smokes a cigarette watching the mayhem impassive
marines are putting on armor gas masks riot gear
al golacinski gs down the line reminding them of protocol
you dont want to be the sonofabitch who started a war they need an hour to burn the classified hold
beat stern you shoot one person theyll kill every one of us in here
protestors now on the embassy grounds carry banners
la ilaha ilallah a woman in a chador uses her own radio
some of them ring around the building holding hands and chanting
some carry automatic weapons openly
tear gas as last resort only i repeat only if your life is under threat
gallegos and sickmann hear golacinskis admonition but pump tear gas out a window onto protestors below despite it
one cannister after another
now the five in the consulate are joined by lee schatz an agricultural attache
were not going out in this we are in the only building with an exit direct to the street
we need to go the sounds of marines barking at one another over the radio
they look out a small window to see a mob outside
im going outside
to reason with them
marines open the chancery door with a look fred kupke communications officer is shouting at staffers who pile up documents for the shredders just everything
dont sort it on the phone none there are no police al golacinski steps out onto the steps and immediately there is shouting and a protestor puts a gun to
his head blindfolds him pushing als head to the ground
second floor anyone who can hear this we need help as we move down the line of desks j stafford is also on a radio repeating the same in farsi
others pack things
marines and staffers including tom ahern run down the hall pushing a cart of items to secure
they reach the security locker code the door and enter the locker heading to the incinerator to begin destroying classified material golacinski held up to the door gun to his
he starts to panic
let me in
open the fucking door
the marines open the chancery door protesters pour in
washington on flash get ops get a line we hear the pounding of footsteps on the roof
they look up
protestors running on the roof of the consulate building
several stop to try and rip off a vent cover using clubs and pipes
thousands are now on the grounds of the embassy and they continue to swarm through the gates
the student with the super continues to film it all
also filming a news photographer with a mm camera
smoking cannisters of tear gas people hurling them
a protestor lights a paper on fire to ward off the sting of the gas staffers using pieces of machines to destroy other machines any embassy equipment that might function
the lights have gone out
the power has been cut
ahern destroys the cryptography keys box sized hard drives while bill daugherty tosses stacks of papers into an electrical furnace
you wanted to see the world
the furnace makes a loud chunk and stops
they both hold their looks for a beat
are you kidding me
get the shredder
brother ali s one of the student leaders shouts as he holds a cloth near his face to protect from tear gas
the mood is now frantic people destroying things or shouting everywhere no
hal yes inside the building in bob anders smashes american visa plates
the visa applicant iranians are now huddled in a group
a couple of the women are wailing
improv resuming the debate over leaving
lijek on his walkie but every channel is now speaking nobody is coming
we need to go
mark gestures for the other six staffers and the twenty iranian visa seekers in the office to head to the stairwell
as no one moves go
one student emerges with a large portrait of khomeini that had been used for dart practice
who has made this
two embassy employees look at the floor
the twenty visa seeking iranians pass our guys and run down the stairs out onto the street and disperse outside
behind them the five consulate employees we saw head down the stairs
so the group of six is mark and cora lijek j and kathy stafford and bob anders
they get to the bottom of the stairs
the students guns drawn burst into the chancery office shouting at ann swift and the others
the mood among the staffers is now almost peaceful
into the phone its done
she puts down the phone
the its quiet the sound of the protest on the other side of the roof and the embassy campus is distant
just the empty street
on the ground discarded banners from the protest fliers and newspapers
we see something that looks like blood on the street
they walk west
theyre hurrying but taking care not to run
the five can hear the gunfire and shouting in farsi
they walk up the street away from the sounds of the protest instinctively grouping together
cora looks back
halfway around the world hell has broken loose here too
bates and malick s state department mid level aides

a television connected to a faraway wall with an extension cord sits on a coffee table

we move over the coffee table a mess of chinese food containers and beer bottles to find tony mendez asleep in his clothes from the day before
the phone rings
he answers it half awake
he listens for a moment then sits up suddenly wide awake
mendezs car speeds by yellow ribbons along trees on canal road
mendez gets out of his car and hurries toward a white building that looks like a college campus
prime minister bani sadr today re stated demands for the hostages release
as we watch him hurry out of his car and into the cia we start to pick up tvs as we go by them all tuned to some version of
the same story
he enters the front doors and crosses the famous emblem on the ground
he moves past the stars on the wall signifying fallen cia officers and there were fewer stars then than now
he passes the security guard at the desk holds up his badge
the guard nods
a young tom brokaw in a yellow sleeveless sweater and teal tie plays on the television intoning on the today show
angela belk young wife of hostage william belk has a soft southern voice and fights back tears

theyre trying to do is weeks since and the images just backfiring its not of bound americans under working armed guard have many losing hope under these images we hear an undulating drone the constant accompaniment of life then coverage of the hostage crisis
the united states shall not purchase oil from iran
iranian assets shall be frozen and the u
shall engage in a forceful campaign of international diplomacy against the iranians
ten weeks states sitting on this
odonnell frantically grabbing documents and tossing them into an accordion folder
the six of them went out a back exit
brits turned them away kiwis turned them away

odonnell hands mendez pages with staff photographs of six people the escaped embassy employees as he continues to toss stuff into his folder
traffic calls them the houseguests
havent left the canadian ambassadors house since it happened
shakes his head just a matter of time
weve got revolutionary guards going door to door like jehovahs witnesses looking for escapees
theyre out for blood tony
half of them think khomeinis been too lenient with the ones in the embassy
walking out of his office mendez following
they walk through an open floor of cubicles lined with offices we get a look at the cia headquarters nothing sleek or sexy about the interior
an open area of desks where woodward and bernstein might be spilling coffee on their thick s ties
papers and files everywhere
trash emptying happens only once a week
cigarette and cigar butts in ashtrays
everything is perpetually a mess
the constant percussive sound of telexes and typing is the metronome that beats out the day here
carters shitting enough bricks to build the pyramids
he wants the six of them out
who else knows
just the families
meanwhile some genius in the embassy was keeping a mug book of everybody who worked there
we think it got shredded before they got in but the fuckers have sweat shop kids in there re assembling the shreds
theyre gonna make an example of the ones who escaped
standing room only for beheadings in the square
they walk through a door and out of the pit
into a hallway with pop art on the walls
people with laminated badges and folders with red stripes walk with purpose
states coordinating in house
they dont do exfils

they want to run it by us strictly as consultants

weve identified backroads from the shemiran district a couple of rat lines through the mountains to the crossing at tabriz
cars are off the table because of the roadblocks
pender nods to bates who gs to a map indicating the north of iran
we wait till the weather clears up then we deliver six bikes and provide maps to the turkish border
we have intelligence they can ride bicycles
or were prepared to send in somebody to teach them
the professional spies shifting at the stupidity of it
but nobody speaks up
and then you can send in training wheels and wait at the border with gatorade
attention turns to mendez
engell not happy
its miles to the turkish crossings
theyd need a support crew behind them with a tire pump
directed at mendez who is weve only been asked to sharpshoot this states handling the op

chambers leads us into the main room leading tony to a table where jack kirby comics artist fusses with large comic panels of argo concept drawings spread over a table
kirby starts to distribute storyboards

tehran mary speaks into a microphone
as the imam khomeini said we have found no evidence that proves that these people are diplomats
odonnell watching the same footage on the news
all evidence proves that these people are spies
the array of video cameras on tripods recording her
our world has changed
the reading of argo is happening around a table
the fire of hope stopped burning in this galaxy long ago
a handsome lead achilles crux says his line

fifty seven fifty eight mark counts out as lee schatz ds push ups
bob anders watches a television in the b
subtitled in farsi
we will not yield to international terror or to blackmail

this montage voice upon voice image upon image landing on television sets
the four hostages hoods on their heads placed against the wall
hostage takers raise their guns at the men
farsi if we find his ship we fire

lester gives glasses to each of them
chambers holds up his glass

tony and odonnell sit in the waiting area across from a secretary
they look down the hall to see cia director admiral stansfield turner s and secretary of state cyrus vance walk down the hall together discussing something in hushed tones
under his breath brace yourself
its like talking to those two old fucks on the muppets
vance and turner enter the room without recognizing them
mendez and odonnell stand up
a concept drawing from argo
aliens and robots

there are only bad options
its about finding the best one
you dont have a better bad idea than this

vance and turner exchange looks
the united states government just sanctioned your science fiction movie
mendez is packing to go
he packs a passport with his photo and the name kevin costa harkins
he takes off his wedding band and places it with care almost with ceremony in a spot on his dresser
odonnell is driving mendez in the passenger seat

in the car
im required to remind you that if youre detained the agency will not claim you
barely claim me as it is
your in case ofs good
they dont need to look at one another
a shared understanding

theyll kill you long before prison
tony gets out of the car pulls his bags from the back seat and slams the door
headed into the airport
siegel is standing in the office watching jimmy carter speak mournfully on tv chambers watching from a desk behind him
bad news bad news even when its good news its bad news
a phone starts john waynes in the ground six months and this is whats left of america
picking up the studio six
weve got a green light
chambers gives siegel a thumbs up
keep the office running till you hear otherwise
this means thank argo fuck yourself
argo fuck yourself
the phone in the living room rings
no one is home
mendez hangs up the airport pay phone
he sits near a mailbox inside the terminal writing on a postcard with the washington monument on it
jack will call
love you both
then he adds so much
he drops the card in the box and heads toward a gate marked lufthansa
the houseguests are gathered around bob anders
it was thirty seconds for christs sake
to get some air in the yard
i couldnt breathe you know what the rules all it takes is one second are
to spot you
who saw me go out

i saw go out
to cora lijek miss hall monitor
creeping around with her notebook dont talk to her that way
to mark little laura ingalls
ill defend myself
watching every move a sound at the door and they go silent
ken carrying his briefcase cheerfully oblivious to what hes walked into
youre getting a visitor
an nsc liaison holding a file with a red stripe walks to jordans office
he finds jordan sitting on a long table looking exhausted silently watching one of the monitors the today show on nbc
a man in scrantons putting a flag on his lawn for every day of captivity
when he runs out of lawn kennedy wins the primary
vance hands him the folder
the six with the canadians are coming out
jordan brought back from scranton and politics by this opens the file and looks at it
after a moment who signed off on this
over the city featuring the famous domed mosques
mendez walks the bosphorus in the b
he reaches the doors of an official looking building and gs inside
mendez sits in a reception room with a few visa applicants
photographs of the ayatollah khomeini hang on the wall
two revolutionary guard officials in ill fitting suits sit at a desk
the iranian consul official late s is smoking
what will be the purpose of your visit to iran
the consul official looks at his canadian passport
why didnt you get your visa in canada
my boss waited until i was here to send the telex
if he had a thought in his head it would die of loneliness
pointed look from mendez
the universal condition of boss hatred almost always works for him and it ds now
stamps the passport
kingdom of iran he crosses out kingdom and writes by hand islamic republic tony walks through the doorway revealing the historic mosque we hear the call to prayer echo through
tony walks through the courtyard
we see some tourists with s instamatics
locals are heading we see the beautiful ceiling of the former cathedral
pull back to reveal tony stands looking out over the second level balcony
a man walks up behind him
iran is a hundred percent not in a pre revolutionary state
mendez looks up a man late s s with a british accent is talking to him
peter nicholls an oxbridge type and a very good spy
cant be right all the time
whend you get back
find mendez and nicholls
were you metal detecting
none left to find
shah escaped with a so laden with gold bars it nearly didnt make it off the runway
but you kept busy
ferrying out the torture apparatus of our friends fallen dictatorship
both these men do this work and share an unspoken understanding
they stop and look up at a mosaic on the wall
an ancient rendition of christ fashioned before the muslims took the city and converted this church to a mosque
nicholls has white and yellow slips of paper with farsi writing on them in hand
he gives them to tony
its getting worse
everybody who lands at mehrabad now fills out one of these
a white one that slip makes a copy to this one underneath
a yellow one passenger keeps yellow airport keeps white
when you leave the country they match them up to verify you came into the country when you said you did
so if they look theyll know six people didnt come in with me
if they look
nicholls and tony turn away from the mosaic surreptitious work now done and meander toward the middle of the great room
nicholls and tony walk towards the inner courtyard
when you land you should go straight to the ministry of culture and islamic guidance to kiss the ring
get on record as having applied for a film permit
if they catch you later at least theyll be confused while theyre torturing you
your biggest problem may be convincing the six of them to go with you
theyre foreign service
nicholls takes a picture
she picked out a ring and gave me a choice
shes a chinese national
if i married her id have to resign so
you and christine
he said that without hesitation
maybe here we realize that mendez is a very good liar
lester is bouncing a rubber ball
the producer from later in the movie walks by
youre working late

producer walks away and lester looks into the argo office as he squeezes the ball
from inside the office in the foreground we see what lester is looking at a phone
mendez sits in a window seat
a flight attendant speaks with a pleasant british accent
the captain has informed us that we have entered iranian airspace
members of our cabin crew will be coming through to collect any remaining alcoholic beverages at this time
mendez walks through the terminal of a crowded s era airport
newly hung portraits of the ayatollah khomeini watch over the duty free shops
the mobs of people with boxes of their worldly belongings puts in high relief that tony is going into a place that everyone else is desperately fleeing
tony fills out a white form
it makes an impression on a yellow form
tony presents his passport to a revolutionary guard immigration official
official looks at it tony hears the sound of a woman screaming in farsi
three lanes away at the outgoing immigration station a revolutionary guard is dragging away the womans husband
the immigration official stamps tonys passport takes the white form gives tony the yellow one and waves him through
archive footage may be mixed with new footage
normal city life mixed with men with automatic weapons
the contradictions of tehran at this moment
a massive helicopter shot of tehran
we tilt down to see a traffic jam sprawls around the azadi monument
bikes mopeds pedestrians peddlers and old patched together cars compete for space
no one gets anywhere
mendez sits in the back of a taxi in the tehran traffic some of the worst traffic in the world
we see the azadi monument out his window
the ayatollah looks down from everywhere
a man is hanging from a crane
people mill underneath
women in chadors at kentucky fried chicken
an armed gang in the back of pickup truck pulls up near his taxi
we see propaganda painted on a wall window
the taxi pulls up to a formal pink building
the driver stops
mehdi behrouz is the newly appointed deputy minister of culture and islamic guidance

before the revolution percent of the movie theaters in tehran were showing pornography
our function is purification as well as promotion of the arts
ill review for the minister
a taxi pulls away
mendez carrying his luggage stands at a wrought iron gate with maple leaves worked into the iron
ken taylor comes out of the building opens the gate himself
he shakes tonys hand and they start to walk to taylors car
i was expecting more of a g man look
youre thinking of fbi sir

taylor gives tony six blank canadian passports
these are blank yknow

and youll fly out with them
a distant sound of a crowd outside
theres something you should know

taylor turns to the window
tony joins him
so sooner is better
they stand listening to the demonstration sounds echoing over the rooftops of the city

automatic gates open
taylor leads mendez inside
pat taylor waits for them in the hall
takes tonys hand
they enter the living room
and here are the six houseguests
theyre looking at mendez like kids waiting to be told the lesson plan
each houseguest has a copy of the argo script
its theater of the absurd
what are the chances
the chances are good
whats the number value of good
percent chance of success
we just what was the objection to picking normal cover identities
there are no canadians in the country for normal reasons
theyll sniff us out the swedish consul said regardless
they accused him of being an american at the airport and held him for an hour
we cant stand up to that
we dont know what the hell movie people do
thats why im here
ill be with you
this is what i do
have you gotten people out this way before
this would be a first
minus j and kathy stafford go into the living room
mendez stays in his seat j approaches him
do you know that every
every day they catch another friend of the shah at the airport
kangaroo trials then firing squads
just for having american names in their phone books
he puts the iranian newspaper in front of mendez
youve been here an hour and youre asking us to trust you with our lives mr
is that your real name
j stafford nods as if this has proven a point
he gs back into the living room followed by kathy
in the tehran times
a man in a suit at mehrabad airport
terrified being led out at gunpoint
mendez comes out and lights a cigarette
ken taylor is already there
weve got orders to close the embassy and go back
theres nowhere for them to stay
im serious too
this is what
dont do this j
the part where we say thats so crazy it just might work
i saw it in burma
they get people out
they know how
snitches in banana republics
they get them over the border after the coup
thats your opinion
pay the guards at the crossing a hundred bucks to look the other way
his opinion got us out of the embassy in the first place
if we go you need to leave immediately
theres a pat and i discussed it
if they catch you at the airport they come here and we go on trial for harboring the enemy
its a risk we took
after a moment can you pull this off
i dont know
even if they do
they find us here were not lying were just hiding
we go out there with fake passports were spies period execution
so how long do we stay
that man out there hes got bad cards hes gonna lose
if he loses its our lives
after a beat and his life too
angles on the houseguests
your cover identities were created specifically for each one of you
mendez now dressed to leave is handing each houseguest an envelope
what i need you to do is memorize everything inside
who you are what you are where youve been
cora lijek looks at a document from inside her envelope
a union card for the canadian writers guild with her picture on it
when were done youll know these so well that youll dream as these people
mendez nods at them and gs
the houseguests look at whats inside their envelopes all except j stafford whose envelope remains sealed
a telefax machine spells out a message letter by letter tony is prepping the canadian passports expertly copying farsi stamps with a small sharpened stick
a knock on the door
tony hides the passports
answers the door
sir a telex arrived for you
the bellhop hands tony a piece of paper
he reads it
mendez takes a small model radio out of his suitcase
he unscrews the casing and from inside takes out what looks like a inch transistor board for the radio
on either side of the board telephone jacks
he detaches the cords from the hotel phone and plugs them into the jacks on the transistor board
its a phone scrambler
the minister of culture and guidance has approved your location scout
mendez on the phone reading the telefax he will send a representative to meet you and your crew at the khayyam entrance to the grand bazaar tomorrow at pm
odonnell on the phone
they called your bluff

how do you think the covers hold up with their fingernails pulled out
mark lijek is studying pages from the envelope tony gave him
j stafford is sitting near him having a drink watching iranian state television footage of the ayatollah

young men carrying automatic weapons casually
behrouz stands next to ali khalkali s a revolutionary committee security official

khalkali has some words in farsi for the young man
tony looks at one of the argo storyboards one depicting an exotic spice market a bazaar in the light

silent assent among the group

a komiteh boss inspects the work of the carpet weaver kids whose numbers have grown into the hundreds as they labor quietly
some headshots are in various stages of repair
dozens of documents are now complete sitting on the floor in rows

cora lijek paints lighter hair dye onto her hair
the houseguests are making subtle efforts to disguise themselves
at a mirror quoting so dont be recognizable but look exactly like your passport picture

a nervous smile
trying to deal with anxiety
j and kathy stafford look to each other
sitting reading newspapers while the other houseguests prep for the scout
the phone starts ringing

four of the houseguests are waiting on the couch dressed in their best approximation of the clothes of a movie scout crew
cora has the maple leaf flag pin on her shirt
they turn when they see tony come in the door
tony as he steps down into the living room down the hall to find j stafford sitting at the table
they are badly shaken
i promise you that if you will play along today i will get you out tomorrow

mendez gs back out to the minivan

mendez in the drivers seat looks at the house then at his watch
he starts up the van filled with four of the houseguests
then he looks in the rearview and sees one of the back doors open
j and kathy stafford board
tony drives the minivan through streets of tehran
the houseguests sit in silence looking out the windows
there is a vehement demonstration going on stars and stripes burning in molavi square and its taking place right in their way
they stop at the demonstration then realize people arent passing by as much as celebrating in the street
tony is forced to nose his way through the crowd chanting and yelling some slapping the windows
they finally get through and pull away
with the demonstration receding behind them tony tries to regain their focus
tell me who you are

his opacity makes it impossible to know
he holds his look to her and she holds hers
reza indicates an exit to the street
and sahar so dignified and stony she is almost shaming these men everyone in this house is a friend of iran
khalkali makes his decision
he wordlessly turns to go
the crowd heckles the houseguests as they walk toward the exit
sahar calmly closes the door
after she ds she lets the facade go
all of a sudden scared
maybe she tears up
either way its clear she knows the stakes of the game she is playing
the houseguests badly shaken come inside
each dealing with shock and adrenaline
ken taylor comes up next to mendez and for once taylors ambassadorial calm is breaking
they drew you out there to take your picture
at the door to the residence tony can see pat taylor holding sahars hand both looking spooked as the houseguests come inside
a beat on mendez who stamps out his cigarette and follows
tomorrow theyll be ready
we start to hear the sound of the evenings call to prayer amplified over a megaphone in the distance
the call to prayer echoing as night falls in tehran
in an alley where cloaked women hurry past posters of khomeini
on a street where a five year old boy in the care of his eight year old brother watches a pickup truck of armed komiteh speed past
mendez holds a passport and some papers in front of bob anders face
it feels late
the houseguests are tired sweating sitting around a dining room
mendez sleeves rolled up drilling them
the argo storyboards are scattered around the room
where was your passport issued
bob anders dsnt know
angles on the houseguests
where were you born
toronno like piranha
canadians dont pronounce the t
some border guards gonna know that
if youre held for questioning theyll bring in somebody who knows that
to cora lijek last three canadian prime minsters
an a student trudeau pearson diefenbaker
to j stafford your job on the film
whats the name of the last film you worked on
high and dry
who paid for the movie
whats your middle name
j stafford is silent
he looks down to consult the paper in front of him but before he can mendez pulls the paper
hes an american spy
a beat on stafford frustrated theyll try to break you by getting you agitated
you need to know your rasuma so well that you dont flinch
nearly defeated you think your little story will matter when theres guns to our heads
my storys the only thing between you and the gun to your head
mendez puts the rasuma back in front of stafford
kathy looks at her husband he just isnt good at this
lets go again
odonnell walking toward his office
its the first time today malinov has seen him
they made it through the location scout
odonnell ignores him
he gs straight to his office
looking like hes seen a ghost
mendez finishing a cigarette outside
we might hear the distant sound of a phone ringing
ken taylor emerges
waits a beat
mendez picks up the complicated looking satellite phone in ken taylors home office
as soon as he ds go to black on green
jacks calling him here so he knows somethings wrong
what is it
go to black on green
mendez turns knobs on the satellite phone
we see jack is on a green phone
it all just changed
they called the game
youve got to come back
on mendez not believing what hes hearing
quiet fast clear joint chiefs are planning a military rescue of the hostages in a month
delta force started training to storm the grounds
so if the six of them get brought down there they wont be held for long
i never would have exposed them if i wasnt authorized to take them out
its over tony
they will be taken
probably not listen to me
the thinkings changed
six americans get pulled out of a canadian diplomats house and executed its another world outrage
six americans get caught playing movie make believe with the cia at the airport and executed its a national embarrassment
theyre calling the operation
were responsible for those people
what we are is required to follow orders
mendez hangs up
odonnell sits listening to the dial tone for a moment then puts the phone on the receiver
then very suddenly he looks at an old coffee cup near him and backhands it off his desk
maybe only a minute maybe ten or more have passed
mendez sits at taylors desk numb
cora lijek knocks but dsnt get a response
she tentatively opens the door and sticks her head inside
were ready to try again
after a beat i think the most important thing you can do to be ready for tomorrow is rest
now the mood among the houseguests is lighter
bob anders a handful of liquor bottles in his arms puts them down on a table
music plays on a record player
scorched earth policy tonight
nothing gets left
taylor comes in drink in hand thoughts heavy looks at tony
so you know
extaff wants you to burn the passports before you leave
mendez looks at the houseguests setting the table
if we tell them theyll panic
its better if you just dont show
it was always a fucked mission
you came closer than anybody else
kathy and cora are cracking each other up
no one sees mendez take a bottle of macallan from the table and put it in his bag
mendez drives through nighttime tehran back to the hotel
there is a dangling totem from the rearview mirror
it reflects light
he passes a van on fire
mendez takes the bottle of macallan from his bag
he takes a drink then drinks more
chambers listening on a phone shakes his head at siegel
he hangs up
they want us to pack up the office
a beat on lester
hes devastated but hes not showing it
they can wait
lets go get a drink
the city waking up

kathy stafford looks at the clock
to j stafford hes late
tony comes out to the balcony with a hotel ice bucket in one hand and the canadian passports in the other
he puts the passports in the bucket lights a match
he looks down at the match at the passports
the first stirring of the morning calls to prayer echo in the distance
hold for a long beat on tony
then he blows out the match
odonnell is packing up for the night
paper towels sit on top of the coffee spill on his rug
his phone rings
he picks up
somebody is responsible for things when things happen jack
i am responsible
im taking them through
and before jack can answer tony hangs up
a duffel bag over his shoulder tony turns out the light in the hotel room
looking at the phone
then with a sudden decision he gets up
rushing out of his office into where he catches alan sosa s head of the directorate of support the cias chief financial officer leaving for the night

everyone except kathy stafford
the passport official looks at kathy who is doing her best to look friendly and casual
then he looks at kathys passport in which she looks stern and angry
kathy stafford smoothes down her hair frowns like she ds in the passport photo
the passport official half smiles and waves her through
theyve all cleared the first checkpoint
khalkali comes upon a diplomatic photograph of a man with glasses

another on the argo script
hes putting things into a box that reads uscia classified material
mendez opens his accordion folder flips through it its empty no

widen to hold on them holding each other in the dark hall of the very american even hummel kitschy house
hold there for a while
a scene of the old west on a television
ian is watching s sci fi western westworld in the bedroom
ian dsnt have to describe the scene to his father this time
widen to see that his head is on a pillow on tonys lap
we can hear the sounds of gunslinging from the movie
glow in the dark stars on the wall
a star wars x wing fighter
a couple of rubber planet of the apes figures that look like theyve been chewed by a dog
the camera moves over the dresser of ians toys settling on a motley group of action figures
then find almost unnoticeable among ians science fiction collection a piece of cardboard behind captain kirk and han solo figures
its a storyboard from argo
the one missed by the komiteh at the airport
linger on the argo storyboard
a man in a futuristic chariot sheltering a kid from what look like laser beams
