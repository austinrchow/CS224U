b if window
href b b fast times at ridgemont high from the outside parking lot it looks like an enormous beached whale
it is the prime hangout for all the teenagers in the area
kids mill around the parking lot or stand by the mall entrance
there are three levels of stores underneath a massive fluorescent roof
different music comes from each store
it looks seventies modern but already used and run down
groups of kids cruise the mall eyeing each other and acting cool
the teenage waitresses in their peppermint pattie uniforms are rushing around trying to keep up with their orders
a good looking man in his mid twenties enters and sits
he wears a plastic name tag that says pacific stereo audio consultant ron johnson
two swensons waitresses pass by with supreme indifference and take their orders into the back kitchen
i think he looks like richard gere
the two waitresses discuss the issue at hand
one of them linda barrett is the seventeen year old retired sex queen of ridgemont high
i think he looks like
bruce springsteen did you see his cute little butt
a third waitress enters
lets talk about c
i think ill drop over and change the shakers
no be cool thats stacys section
through the entrance we see stacy hamilton
she is the fifteen year old trainee sweet looking with just the last traces of baby fat
she puts down a glass of water for ron spills some and mops it up
hes too old for stacy she hasnt even started high school yet
a flustered stacy enters the back kitchen
hows it going

in a blow dryed kind of way
does anyone else want to take his table
dont you like him
yeah but i fucked up
you can take it
come on stacy its your section and your man
what should i do
just take his order look him in the eye and if he says anything remotely funny laugh a lot
she fluffs up stacys hair and gently shoves her towards the door
stacy reluctantly exits
stacy goes to rons table
so you working hard or hardly working
stacy thinks it over decides its a joke and laughs a little too late
ron looks at her soulfully
you look like you could still be in high school
i know everyone says that
he stares at her and she stares back uncomfortably
what can i get for you tonight
how about your phone number
stacy smiles nervously
a teenage boy stands in front of an in mall theatre across from swensons
he wears a stiff over sized tuxedo suit
he is mark the rat ratner a ticket taker on the job
mike damone a transplanted easterner bops over from the record store eyeing every girl he passes
he stops at the movie theatre
do you ever look at those girls who work at swensons
and i have to stand out here and watch them six nights a week
you should work for yourself
two junior high kids spot damone walk up to him
what can i do for you gentlemen
you the guy with the van halen tickets
i could be
what do you want for something in the first ten rows
twenty bucks apiece
those tickets were only twelve fifty
so dont buy em
to friend all the other scalpers are sold out arnold
damone reacts indignantly
you call me a scalper
i perform a service my friends
the service costs money
now do you want the tickets or not
the kids look at each other
are you sure you cant go any lower
these are my special back to school prices
well take em
damone reaches inside his pants pocket for a wad of tickets
at the other end of the mall is a neon lit carls jr
if swensons was the warm up this is the main attraction of the ridgemont mall
back to school banners hang from the walls
many kids are lined up at the counters
in the middle of the kitchen directing all the orders is a seventeen year old named brad
he moves confidently observing the fryer checking cup supply and giving an affectionate squeeze to a pretty cashier named lisa
she lets him kiss her but only once
a teenage customer shouts to brad from the front counter
i waited till you came on
i wanted your fries
brad smiles walks over to the fryer and discards the fries left from the previous shift
he shouts to the other employees as he puts in a new batch his batch
we need fifteen superstars david
ill take care of the fry orders
just get me the superstars
brad spots three surfers sitting in the dining area
none of them are wearing shirts
hey you guys
you had shirts on when you came in here
a bleary kid sitting at the head of the table
he runs a hand through his long stringy blond hair
after a time he speaks
something happened to them mon
come on spicoli
why dont you just put your shirts back on
see the sign
that reads no shirts no shoes no dice a store manager dennis taylor bustles up to brad
no just a couple of surfers with no shirts on
i took care of it dennis
grumbling putting shirts back on
it pains them
dennis heads back to his office when he sees something in the trash bin
did you throw away those fries hamilton
they were left over from the last shift
those were perfectly good fries hamilton
glares at brad perfectly good
but they werent mine
brad laughs goes back to work
it is closed and only a few janitors remain
stacy and linda walk through the large empty mall
he gave me his card
lovingly ron johnson audio consultant
amused should we buy a frame for that
come on linda i havent had a boyfriend all summer
you promised when i started working at the mall that my life would change
do you think hell call this week

i thought if i gave out a vibe theyd get the message and call me up
well guess what
they dont call
so what did you do
i called them
if i was sitting next to a guy and i wanted to sit closer id sit closer
if i wanted to kiss him id just do it

they pass a janitor cleaning graffiti that says lincoln surf nazis and maggot lust for the dust
with some guys you have to make the first move
a lot of guys are just
stacy what are you waiting for
i did it when i was thirteen
its no huge thing
its just sex
if you dont one of the other girls will
cute he was hot wasnt he

a young girl runs and catches up with linda and stacy
breathless are you linda barrett

judy hinton from may company told me i could ask you something
i have this situation with my boyfriend and i wanted to
looks at stacy then whispers in lindas ear linda listens thoughtfully then clicks into her sex expert mode
okay are you over sixteen
the girl nods
all right what you want to do is go to the free clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly several times a week and that you need
nornel one plus fiftys
and they dont call my parents
not if youre over sixteen
thanks a lot linda
and dont let them talk you into a diaphragm either
the girl thanks linda again
linda and stacy get to the back exit of the mall and linda uses a key to open the door
i cant believe i start high school tomorrow
they exit the mall into the night
we see all the elements of the first day of school
the students carry new books explore new lockers begin to stake out their ground
someone has taken the steel letters from the green vanguard out front
it reads idg mon senor hi the rest of ridgemont high is covered with toilet paper
and a black spray paint message along the side of the front office building reads lincoln brad pulls into the ridgemont high parking lot
he drives a beat up four door model ltd sedan
three friends wait for him near his parking space
they are dressed in the same golf caps with brand logos on the front like cat national and chainsaw
the cruising vessel
brad climbs out of his car and pats it admiringly
six more payments gentlemen
brad joins his friends and they walk towards the gymnasium
we see a shiny new blue mustang whip into the parking lot
students scatter from the parking space
behind the wheel is football star charles jefferson
a huge black kid
the halls at ridgemont part for charles jefferson
rat and damone are in the parking lot
damone surrounded by underclassmen customers selling tickets
see that mustang
gave charles jefferson that car when he was a sophomore
the underclassmen are impressed
they watch as jefferson opens his car door and stands to his full height over six foot tall
he opens his trunk and pulls out no books just a football duffel bag
he slowly walks by damone rat and the underclassmen
how ya doing
that car looks great charles
jefferson gives damone a death glare
he moves on
damone resumes selling tickets
shit thats my man
we see a clutching smooching couple walk by
cheerleader cindy carr and her boyfriend gregg adams
the four stoners from carls jr
tumble out of a van in the parking lot
they head towards the gymnasium
standing by the a b c d e registration counter in the gymnasium brad waits to pick up his red ad card
he stands surrounded by his buddies
they nod vigorously at everything brad says
as he talks fellow students all say hello or pat him as they pass
one troubled looking boy arnold walks up to brad
brad can i talk to you a minute
arnold speaks confidentially to brad
brad i really fuckin hate mcdonalds man
ever since they started in with the chicken everything went downhill
you want to work at carls
oh man if you could swing something there id do anything for you
i want to work with you guys
i can probably get you in there
just let me talk to dennis taylor
brad notices stacy and nods with complete inner cool
everyone wants to know where lisa is
how should i know where lisa is
to buddies what am i gonna do
now my little sister goes to the same high school
the partys over
to stacy so who do you have first period
concerned whats wrong with mr
if you like hawaii five o
you better get in class stacy
thats not the one to be late to
stacy hurries off
as soon as she is gone your sister is really turning into a fox
you should see her in the morning
stacy barely slips in the door before the final attendance bell sounds
she finds a seat just as the teachers cubicle door opens at the back of the classroom
a tall figure comes barreling down the aisle
he is mr
the man makes a double speed step to the door at the front of the class kicks the door shut and locks it
the windows rattle in their frames
stacy watches wide eyed at her first high school class
my name is mr
hand writes his name on the green chalkboard before his class
every letter is a small explosion of chalk
almost sweetly i have but one question for you on our first morning together
pause can you attend my class
history has proven us one basic fact
man does not do anything that is not for his own good
it is for your own good that you attend my class
and if you cant make it
i can make you
an impatient knock begins at the front door of the classroom
we have a twenty question quiz every friday
it will cover all the material weve dealt with during the week
there will be no make up exams
its important that you all have your land of truth and liberty textbooks by wednesday
at the latest
the knock continues
your grade is the average of all your quizzes plus the midterm and final which counts for one third
the mystery knocker tries a lazy calypso beat on the front door
no one in mr
history class dares mention it much less answer it
stacy grips her desk with the tension of her first day
there will be no eating in this class
you get used to doing your own business on your own time
thats one demand i make
i dont like staying after class with you on detention
thats my time
i dont like wasting it
just like you wouldnt want me to come to your house some evening and discuss u
history on your time
hand finally turns as if he has just noticed the sound at the door and opens the door an inch
jeffrey spicoli stands in the doorway red eyes glistening
his long blond hair is still wet and streaming down the back of his white peasant shirt
he grins oblivious to such trivial matters as attendance bells
a student sitting near stacy turns to his friends
that guy has been stoned since the third grade
im registered for this class
this is u
i saw the globe in the window
appears enthralled really
spicoli holds his red ad card up to the crack in the door
can i come in
swinging door open oh please
i get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and i dont see all my kids here
he is the only one
sorry im late
this new schedule is totally confusing
hand takes the red ad card and reads from it with utter fascination
thats the name they gave me
hand slowly tears the card into little pieces and sprinkles the pieces over his wastebasket
spicoli watches in disbelief
his hands are frozen in the process of removing his backpack
you just ripped my card in two
whats your problem
hand moves to within inches of spicolis face
no problem at all
i think you know where the front office is
it takes a moment for the words to work their way out of jeff spicolis mouth
in the tense moment that follows no one in the class is sure what might happen
hand simply turns away from jeff spicoli as if he ceased to exist and coolly continues his lecture
ive taken the time to print up a complete schedule of class quizzes and the chapters they cover
please pass them back to the desks behind you
hand begins passing out stacks of purple mimeographed sheets
all smelling the purple mimeographed sheets
still standing in the doorway hyperventilating with fifteen year old adrenalin is jeff spicoli
after a time he fishes a few bits of his ad card out of the wastebasket and huffs out of the room
the schools outdoor dining area is actually just a small courtyard lined with fast food machines and dominated by a large oak tree in the center
standing at the center of lunch court under the large oak tree is brad hamilton and his golf cap buddies
you hear about the surfer in mr
his buddies shake their heads
told hand to fuck off
brad sees another friend pass through lunch court
brad waits for him to pass
i hear thompson got canned at bobs this summer
they hacked his hours so he quit
where is he now
making two eighty at seven eleven
pause they make you wear a fuckin candy stripe suit over there
near the outer rim of lunch court
jeff spicoli comes stumbling out into the daylight surrounded by a small group of ridgemont stoners
marijuana smoke billows out behind them
it was so bitchin mon
everybody is talking about it
the motherfucker pissed me off
you dont have to take that shit
i didnt take that shit
they all laugh flip hair out of their eyes
tell us again
what happened after he ripped up your ad card
i called him a dick
and then i reached for his class notes and i ripped em up
i said hey bud
two can play this game
the stoners go wild
ill tell you this
if he hassles me again i cant be responsible for what happens
you know why
because hes a fuckin dick
you got it
pause gimme a dollar
one surfer digs out a dollar for spicoli
they look out at lunch court see it teeming with straight kids
they turn and walk towards the parking lot
as they walk onto lunch court
they take a seat on the outskirts of the area and watch all the students crowding onto the eating area
i hear some surfer pulled a knife on mr
hand this morning
he just called him a dick
people exaggerate so much at this school
the school couple cindy and gregg walk by
god you look so great
hi you guys
this is stacy
stacy this is gregg adams and cindy carr
gregg and cindy move on repeating the same scene a few feet away
if theres one thing that never changes
its a cheerleader
stacy turns to see a girl with short black hair passing by wearing tight black spandex pants and dark lipstick
that girl looks just like pat benatar
they watch her pass
actually there are three girls at ridgemont who have cultivated the pat benatar look
linda gestures out on lunch court
wearing pink spandex pants and short cropped black hair with dark lipstick
wearing blue spandex pants and short black hair
she stands a good distance away from the other two
none of them talk to each other
linda looks at them with bemusement but stacy is wondering
do you think guys find that attractive
oh give me a break stacy
youre much prettier than them
they sit and eat their lunches
linda has her perennial diet lunch of yogurt and raw vegetables
yeah but they look more sophisticated
youd probably think theyd be better in bed
what do you mean better in bed
you either do it or you dont
no there are variables that like i might not be good at
shyly like you know giving blow jobs
whats the big deal
well i never did it
theres nothing to it
she takes out a carrot stick and eases it down her throat
stacv tries one but chokes
you just have to practice a little first
feels her throat relax these muscles
think of your throat as an open tunnel
the girls try sliding the carrot sticks down their throats without gagging
at the next table sees them and points them out to his companions
dont laugh at me but when a guy has an orgasm
you know like how much comes out
stacy stops practicing and looks horrified
thats where that group got its name from
they continue practicing as the boys look on
stacy manages to get almost a whole carrot down her throat to lindas amazement
the group of boys break out in applause
stacy looks very embarrassed
the class is situated so that all students sit at bunson burner tables lining the room
pat is seated at one of the tables and stacy takes a seat nearby she looks at the ledge in front of her
it contains a pig embryo
she listens to the conversation next to her
ill tell you right now
im not going
ill get sick or something
im not going into a room with a bunch of dead guys
its part of the final
a pat benatar have you heard what they do
have you heard
the bodies are dissected mike and mr
vargas pulls out parts of the dead body and holds them up
you mean he reaches in and pulls this stuff out
like a heart
hearts lungs guts
stacy strains to hear more just as mr
vargas a diminutive man holding a coffee mug enters the class
good day everyone
i just switched to sanka
im running a little slow today so have a heart
he is riveted on stacy hamilton swooning
we see stacys room a young girls room with posters and frilly pillows
stacy is in bed and her mother is just leaving the room
sleep tight stacy
good night mom
her mother shuts off the light exits
stacy pulls back the covers
she is fully dressed
we see the window to stacys room slide slowly open and watch her slip outside
she hikes down a drainage pipe to the street
a brown mg pulls up
stacy jumps from the shadows and hops in
the car drives away
ron sits behind the wheel humming casually along to the music on his car stereo
ron has on a light brown leather jacket
he looks like a contestant for the dating game
a little nervous thanks for picking me up
he speeds off turning up the radio to sing along
the cuer vo gold the fi ine columbian
eyes stacy you look nice tonight
so do you
where do you feel like going
i dont know
wherever you want
how about the point
nervously the point sounds fine
looks at her knowingly all right the point it is
we see stacys anxious face as the car speeds up ridgemont drive with music
stacy and ron sit in the car listening to music
the point is a natural lookout spot that lovers can discover
it is behind the baseball field and dugout of ridgemont high school
stacy and ron get out of the car and walk to the baseball dugout
they sit side by side
above them a single light bulb shines a very private fifty watts on things
thats a nice shirt
thanks a lot
they look at each other look away
its very warm out tonight
its very warm
i wonder how long it will last
ron leans over and kisses stacy lightly on the cheek
stacy sits quietly for a moment thinking was that the first move
then she lunges at ron and kisses him square on the mouth
at first surprised ron then holds her there and kisses her in return
after a time he breaks away
are you really nineteen
i am really nineteen
they continue making out
i think i better take you home
what about those other guys you live with
i mean back to your home
but they make no moves in any direction
they continue making out
ron begins unbuttoning her blouse and massaging stacys breasts
a moment later he tugs at her pants
awkwardly she starts to help him
he tilts her backward onto the concrete dugout bench
they kiss feverishly her hand pulling off her shoes then her pants
ron goes to work
whispers is this your first time
as she feels a man enter her for the first time we see the graffiti above her surf nazis lincoln was here sieg heil led zeppelin dan y roberto disco
fags stacy is standing by her locker twirling the combination
she is joined by linda barrett
was it great
it was okay
youll always remember your first time
it was nice
so tell me do you like ron
is it serious
come on linda
its just sex
thats my line
they both laugh and walk down the hall
stacy arrives home
the hamilton home has that anonymous prepackaged tract look like many others in this lower middle class neighborhood
brad washes his car in the driveway and listens to the car radio
mom says to clean up the pool
why cant you do it
your friends use the pool
your friends messed it up
your friends use the pool too
i take out the garbage
dont strain yourself
stacy bristles and heads inside the front door
the furniture in the hamilton living room looks like it was gleaned for a sale at pic n save
through the living room one can see a very small kidney shaped pool
stacy checks an erasable telephone message sheet near the refrigerator
there are two names on it brad stacy
brads side is filled with messages
stacys is empty
she notices a summer bouquet floral arrangement
stacy reads the attached note
it reads memories of you ron johnson
she quickly gathers it up and carries it back outside
she fans the door several times to dispel the odor
have mom or dad seen this
theyre not home yet
brad what would you say if i asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the cruising vessel and get rid of them at work
who the hell is ron johnson
ill explain everything later
brad nods as stacy pushes the flowers into his arms
damone expertly fills two glasses three quarters full of kahlua then adds a few drops of milk
music is playing on a nearby speaker
damone hands the rat a drink and checks himself out in his mirror
see that moustache coming in rat
there is only a hint of peach fuzz but he grooms it anyway
you can almost press it out
damone turns around
his friend is preoccupied
i am in love
damone takes a sip of his drink looks at the rat
are a wuss
what do you mean wuss
this girl is my exact type
distracted its definitely your mama
damone you gotta listen to me
damone quits puttering around his room with the kahlua and milk
he grabs a chair and straddles it
where did you see her
shes in my biology class
did you get her number
did you get her name
its too soon
its never too soon
girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes
well what do you want me to do
go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say hello
id like you to take your clothes off and jump on me
thoughtfully i would
i can see it all now
this is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at fotomat this summer
you bought forty bucks of fuckin film and you never even talked to her
woeful you tell me mike
what do i do
sighs but loves it heres what you do
damone gets up moves to the door
you start from the second you walk into biology
dont just walk
move across the room
he saunters over to the chair
dont talk to her
let her know
use your face
use your body
this is what i do
i just sent out the vibe and i have personally found that
girls do respond
of course something happens
you put the vibe out to thirty million chicks you know somethings gonna happen
thats the idea rat
thats the attitude
the attitude dictates that you dont care if she comes stays lays or prays
whatever happens your toes are still tappin
when you are the cruelest and the coolest
then you have the attitude
damone knocks down the rest of his drink and we
we see brad operating at full throttle in the kitchen and taking a moment to sneak a kiss with his girlfriend lisa as she goes to the front counter to
open up a cash register
she allows him only one kiss
were those flowers really for me brad
how much did they cost
dont worry about it
she gives him a kiss
on the cheek
lets go to the point tonight
she pulls away
whats there to do at the point
brad shifts his weight tries to find the right words
whats there to do at the point
god lisa weve been going together almost two years and
i dont want to have to use sex as a tool
tool for what
weve been going together almost two years
i dont want to talk about it here brad
brad prepares to respond
he squints his eyes prepares for a truly sizzling comeback when dennis taylor short and prematurely balding assistant manager of carls jr
comes bustling out of his back office
he quickly surveys the situation in the kitchen
you have fifteen double cheese to box
lisa returns to her cashier post leaving brads last words stalled in his mouth
we see the hamiltons cul de sac home
all the lights are off in the house at this hour
except for brads room
brad is alone in his room
hes prone on his neatly made bed reading a paperback book entitled power with class
on the wall of brads room is a large framed photo of a carls jr
brad hears a muffled knock at his door
come on in
stacy walks into brads room
thanks for getting rid of those flowers
dont worry about it
who sent the flowers
its just some guy i met at swensons
you dont know him
i dont care it you tell me or not
i got problems of my own
he begins pacing
is everything okay at work
are you kidding
work is great
i kill at work
i dont even mind mom and dad making me pay rent
youre going to break up with lisa arent you
ive been doing some thinking
its my last school year
im a single successful guy
i think i want my freedom
because she wont sleep with you
where did you hear that
im just guessing
maybe you just need to give her some time
shes so nice brad
everybody loves lisa
everybody loves lisa
everybody loves lisa
but everybody doesnt have to be her boyfriend
suddenly stacy pops the question
are you still a virgin
i dont know
i was just curious
you are a virgin
i didnt say that
but your face did
then brad turns serious
are you still a virgin
dont give me that shit
i know youre still a virgin
stacy smiles and stands up
she playfully slaps her brother on the arm and walks down the hallway to her room
we can see there is less frill and lace in stacys room
the junior high paperbacks are gone
there are no dolls in sight
linda and stacy walk past rows of cars
stacy stops at a brown mg
theres his car
i know hes at work tonight
he hasnt come into swensons since he called my house
my mother told him i was still at high school after i told him i was nineteen
i guess i should tell him im fifteen
dont you dare youll never hear from him again
does doug care that youre seventeen
doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like
thats why im marrying him
if he ever calls again ill say im eighteen
boy i am so glad to be through with all these games
they enter the mall
we are now several weeks into the school year
hand is dropping test papers on desks like they are pieces of manure
three weeks weve been talking about the platt amendment
what are you people
a piece of legislation was introduced into congress by senator john platt
it was passed in
this amendment to our constitution has a profound impact upon all of our daily liv
hand stops on a dime
he is like a champion hunting dog that has just picked up the scent
he scans the room
where is jeff spicoli
there is silence in the u
i saw him earlier today near the building bathrooms
is he still on campus
one student sitting next to stacy raises his hand
i saw him by the food machines
how long ago
just before class sir
hand snaps his fingers hawaii five o style
bring him in
desmond hustles out the door
what is this fascination with truancy
what is it that gets inside your heads
hand begins to pace the aisles as he speaks
occasionally for emphasis he bends down to lecture directly into the students faces
there are other teachers in this school who look the other way at truants
points to attendance clip on the doorway its a little game that you both play
they pretend they dont see you you pretend you dont ditch
who pays the price later
desmond returns to the room with a red eyed jeff spicoli
wait a minute
theres no birthday party for me here
thank you desmond
to spicoli whats the reason for your truancy
i couldnt make it in time
in top form you mean you couldnt
or you wouldnt
i dont know mon
the food lines took forever
food will be eaten on your time
pause why are you continuously late for this class mr
why do you shamelessly waste my time like this
i dont know
hand appears mesmerized
he then turns and heads for the board
he writes in long large letters as he slams the chalk into the green board
he writes i dont know
i like that
he stands back and admires it
he turns randomly to stacy
dont you like that miss hamilton
i really like that too
i dont know
hand will i pass this class
spicoli i dont know
i like that
i think im going to leave your words on this board for all my classes to enjoy
giving you full credit of course mr
we hear the blare of the dismissal bell
stacy and the other students get up to leave
spicoli stays in place
he has just figured out a truly bitchin comeback
and his mouth is forming the first word when mr
hand cuts him off
you can go now
hand turns back to his desk
the rest of the students have already left
spicolis audience is gone
he shrugs and lopes out the door
its christmas time at the ridgemont mall
all three tiers are strung with neon lights and we hear the sound of the bell ringing santas
stacy and linda are enjoying a brief lull in the christmas season madness
they sit at the sundae bar
stacy looks forlorn almost red eyed as she makes a sundae
youve got to get used to working christmas
people are always screaming and yelling
then they get home and theyre all christmasy
i think christmas brings out the worst in people
i guess ron hasnt called yet
not since november
linda nods her head always the coach
stacy it doesnt look good for the relationship
stacy continues making her ice cream slapping the scoops onto the stainless steel dish
sighs dont you think it meant anything to him
even if i am fifteen
what does it matter
hes a stereo salesman
you want to marry him
you want to have kids with him
you want this guy to come home fifty years old and hes still got that little pacific stereo badge on
who are seated at a back table feeding each other
stacy looks at her finished sundae
i should quit this job
im going to get so fat working here
nobody will ever take me out
how many times do i have to tell you
you are really going to be beautiful
thanks a lot
linda punches stacy lightly on the shoulder
hey ron johnson
its his loss
we follow stacy as she walks into the dining room to serve the sundae
we see a group of buzz cut young toughs walking in formation hunched over sneering and wearing sleeveless u
army fatigue jackets
none of these damaged looking kids is over the age of fourteen
they pass to reveal this legend on their backs angle on mike damone and mark ratner who are standing by the upcoming concert list posted on the door to wherehouse
damone sees the surf nazis pass turns to mark ratner who is still wearing his cinema four jacket
the business is changing rat
ill tell you these kids today
they dont even listen to aerosmith
i hear they all dress like that at lincoln now
there used to be three or four of those guys
now we see em every time we come to the mall
damone is approached by a couple of young ticket customers
got any blue oyster cult tickets
i ate twenty four pairs of blue oyster cult tickets last time around
i was this close to working at
suddenly we see all ticket business stop
damone and his customers see someone menacingly coming directly for them
the small crowd parts as charles jefferson football duffel bag in hand walks up
with him is a thick tough miniature version of himself
this is little charles
they both stop in front of damone
after long look when is earth wind and fire coming
respectfully im really not sure
i havent heard anything yet but ill let you know the second there is the slightest news sir
im taking my little brother
so that will be two tickets
jefferson and l
push past the customers
he really lives here
i thought he just flew in for the football games
gaining composure shit hes my man
he knows where to come for tickets
damone turns to the rat
are you ready for the moment of truth
the rat adjusts his jacket and nods
she is immune to my charms
they walk together towards swensons as the rat drapes his aqua blue cinema four jacket around his shoulders like a french film director
damone walks a few steps then stops rat
ace the jacket
the rat considers the suggestion gets rid of the jacket
they continue towards swensons
the rat pulls open the door to swensons
he walks toward the counter to stacy hamilton
may i help you
the rat feels the beginnings of cold panic but barges through nonetheless
i have two questions
i was curious
his voice becomes a shade deeper
he begins to pull the attitude together
what do you do with the jackets people leave here
smiling we keep them
you keep them
we keep them in case the people come back
she reaches under the counter and pulls out a cardboard box with some rumbled jackets and other items
here they are
you can look through it if you want
the rat chuckles to himself struggling with the attitude
it would take too much time to go through all that stuff
ill just pick up a new one
hes obviously awkward and she likes it
whats your other question
my other question is
can i have your phone number so i can ask you out sometime
to the rats surprise stacy continues smiling
do you have a pen
this ones out of ink
he pulls one out of his jacket pocket gives it to her
stacy writes her name and phone number on a scrap of paper and gives it to him
the rat looks at the paper
nice to meet you stacy
my name is mark ratner
he sticks out his hand and they shake
we see the rat turn around and walk out of swensons
the rat exits with ultimate cool
he sees damone waiting just off to the side talking to some girls
the rat nods gives him the thumbs up
damone returns the gesture
carls is happening tonight
there are lots of kids inside
we hear charging rock music girls got rhythm by ac dc coming from a radio in the back kitchen
inside the bathroom brad hamilton applies the carls scrub brush to a felt tip graffiti message near the mirror i eat big hairy pussy
he pauses and catches himself in the mirror
he adjusts his hair
talking to mirror lisa
i have something to tell you
look im a senior now
im a single successful guy and ive got to be fair to myself
i think i need my freedom
brad pauses looks at the mirror soulfully
aw dont do that
dont take it personally okay
i knew youd understand because
the bathroom door opens its arnold the boy who brad got a job
i know youre on your break but would you cover me on register three
brad nods exits brad stands at the register
we see a prominent display over brads head try our guaranteed breakfast
the last of many harried businessmen customers gets his breakfast order and takes his seat
brad is joined by dennis taylor the assistant manager
clean that counter off brad
brad begins polishing the counter and dennis taylor returns to his office at the back of the kitchen
brad watches him disappear behind the door that says assistant manager
as soon as dennis disappears behind the door the one businessman in the place rises and returns to the counter
nervously may i help you
the businessman has short curly brown hair
he speaks in a whine
this is not the best breakfast i ever ate
the businessman points to the huge display over brads head try our guaranteed breakfast
and i want my money back
brad begins searching under the counter
well i believe you have to fill out a form
theres a pad right around here
i want my money back right now
well thats not the way it works really
and you ate most of your food already too
see that sign
it says money back guarantee
do you know the meaning of the word guarantee
do they teach you that here
give me my money back
brad begins looking to the restroom
i cant do that
but if you wait a minute
as if talking to a kindergartner look
just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my
looks at name tag please brad
im sorry sir
just let me find the forms here
i am so tired
i am so tired of dealing with morons
how hard is it to
brad looks up from under the counter
no amount of pay will make him take that kind of insult
mister if you dont shut up im gonna kick of your ass
the door to the assistant managers office swings open and dennis comes hurtling out of the back
can i help you sir
is there a problem
you bet theres a problem
your employee used profanity and threatened me with violence
im shocked frankly
ive eaten here many times and ive always enjoyed the service until today
angle on bathroom door as it opens and arnold starts towards the register
he quickly sees the incident with the irate businessman and ducks back inside the bathroom
all i wanted was my money back for this breakfast
it was a little undercooked
and this young man threatened me
now i plan to write a letter
i plan to
dennis wheels around to brad
did you threaten this man or use profanity in any way
he insulted me first
he called me a moron
did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way
brad looks around expecting his friends to defend him
dave and rich seem very occupied with their work
brad is stunned
to businessman im very sorry this happened to you sir
thank you very much
then brad unhooks his fryers apron and throws it on the counter
he grabs a backpack and walks out of the place
on the way he bangs the bathroom door with his fist
i hope you had a hell of a piss arnold
he arrives back in his room and locks the door
he yanks the burger picture off his wall dumps it into the trash
then he takes it back out of the trash and cracks the cardboard picture and plastic frame in half
we are in the middle of a deep dark void
after a moment a pinprick of light appears in the distance
we head towards the light
we are being led somewhere important
as we draw still closer curtains suddenly part to reveal a wildly cheering studio audience
we hear the voice of merv griffin
will you please give a warm welcome to
the merv griffin show band begins playing a merv griffin show version of ac dcs highway to hell
someone hands jeff spicoli a microphone
he works the studio audience into a frenzy as he sings the words to highway to hell merv griffin show style
singing layin ladies
you gotta dollar youre a friend of mine
you and me its get down time
were on the highway to hell
the highway to hell
spicoli finishes up with a spectular pump
the audience goes wild as merv griffin greets him warmly and guides spicoli to his seat
spicoli motions for the cheers to die down
griffin is obviously happy to see him
he touches spicolis arm lightly
howve you been
nice to be here
i feel great
i was going to say
your eyes look a little red
ive been swimming merv
the audience howls
its a famous spicoli line
seriously merv everything is great
i was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend maybe going up to the mountains
concerned i wanted to talk a little bit about school if i could
sighs school is no problem
all you have to do is go to get the grades
and if you know something all you have to do is go about half the time
how often do you go
i dont go at all
the audience is howling again
he is mervs favorite guest
i hear you brought a film clip with you
do you want to set it up for us
well it pretty much speaks for itself
peter you want to run with it
the film clip begins
it is a mammoth wave cresting against the blue sky
merv this is the action down at sunset cliffs at about six in the morning
a tiny figure appears at the foot of the wave
thats me merv
the audience gasps
are you going to ride that wave
we watch as spicoli catches the perfect wave and it hurtles him through a turquoise tube of water
whats going through your mind right here jeff
the danger of it all
merv im thinking
ive only got about four good hours of surfing left before these little clowns from junior high start showing up with their boogie boards
the audience is howling once again
when suddenly we hear the loud noise of a door opening followed by a shrill voice
it is spicolis eight year old brother curtis
jeff spicolis dream of glory evaporates
it is a messy trailer part of a trailer park by the sea
spicolis area is small but he has made it his own
the walls are covered with posters almost all of them naked centerfolds
it is obvious spicolis parents are not welcome in his room
dad says you have to get up
he groans starts to struggle out of bed
leave me alone
dad says youre late again you butthole
leave me alone
spicoli reaches over to the floor next to his bed
he pulls a snorkel from the mess heaves it at the door and his little brother
it bounces off the wall and doesnt even hit curtis but the kid starts crying anyway
jeff threw a snorkel at me
spicoli gets out of bed groans again and kicks the door shut
celebrating the big game with rival lincoln high school
we see jeff spicoli stumble from the direction of the parking lot
he heads into the gym which is already full for a mandatory assembly
spicoli wanders into the assembly takes a seat on a corner bleacher
he sits just below brad hamilton and lisa
on podium in front of assembly cindy carr and another cheerleader dina phillips are making a presentation before the school
i just want to say that we are not spirit bunnies anymore
we always hated that name
it bugged the heck out of dina and me
its just such a put down
they dont call the chess club checker champs or anything like that
were going to go to everything this year you guys
were going to go to soccer wrestling basketball
we know youve got a lot of spirit
and were gonna destroy lincoln next week
they dont respond
who is asleep in the bleachers
we hear them over the drone of the assembly
man i dont even want to see those guys from carls again
if youd apologize i think dennis would take you back
apologize to that wimp
fuck dennis taylor
they sit in silence for a moment
im just glad were still together lisa because i need you this year
sighs look brad ive been trying to think of a way to tell you this
were almost out of high school this is our last year
i think we owe it to ourselves to be free and meet some new people
then if we get back together well know its the right thing
as he accepts the news
but i still want to be friends
as it falls slack
were going to be going to every game this year
we just want the crowd to participate and we want spirit from every little person in this entire school
there is unenthusiastic minor applause from the assembled students of ridgemont high
vice principal ray connors a tough looking man with an h
haldeman crew cut approaches the podium
he has a sour look on his face
well thank you girls
people dont forget the big game is one week away
well see everybody back here on monday and have a good weekend
for the first time during this assembly there is a loud and hearty applause
we are suddenly watching a movie shown on a class projection screen
we see footage of a serene middle class neighborhood as seen through the glass windshield of a car
judging from the other vehicles parked on the street the film is from the early sixties
we hear the narrative voice of desi arnaz speaking in his inimitable latin accent
driving ess an important part of each and every one of our da ily lives
ees a responsibility like no o ther and ess a matter of life and
a ball comes rolling out into the serene street
a small child runs out after it
the driving of our vehicle brakes but not in time
the film freeze frames on the terrified face of a child about to be splattered
there is a swell of dramatic music
they have foun
the braking point
the words flash on the screen and we hear a high school drivers training class groan in mock horror
who are seated in this class
sitting together in the class
they are oblivious lost in conversation
what do you think of that guy who works at the theatre
you know mark ratner
oh come on
what is he
linda looks nauseous
just watch out if he pulls up in a van and then puts on a led zeppelin tape
the film returns to another serene street scene as seen through another front windshield
the driver here has had jus two drinks
two drinks at the home of a frien
we hear the very present sounds of drivers training students
hes fucked up ricky
they guys a drunk ricky
and although this driver thinks he ees drivin well he may be doing okay but he forgets to per ceive what ees real goin on
in the film another car comes barreling from the left running a stop sign and exploding into the side of the two drink goner
in the class the drivers training students are howling
the parking lot is full
kids and shoppers stream through the entrance in groups of all sizes
all three levels are teeming with kids
where we see jeff spicoli manning the missile command machine
spicoli wears a red bandana across his forehead
a cigarette dangles from his mouth
he is surrounded by a fleet of young surfers who listen to him with reverence
the thing about missile command is to decimate before you can be decimated
just like in real life
the youngsters hang on every word of the sage advice
walking in formation
walking the mall
check it out rat
the surf nazis
out for a sunday stroll
damone and the rat walk on
the rat is barely interested
he appears deep in thought
what do i say after she gets in the car
damone obviously in his element here at the mall stops to flash a winning smile at a well built older housewife
no problem rat
what you need is my special five point plan
as he talks damone passes a country farms shop
he plucks a free sample of cheese and sausage
knock it off damone
i need real help
what do you mean
men have died trying to obtain this information
i will give it to you for free
the rat and damone continue on
whats the five point plan
the rat nods always the student as they pass a wherehouse record store
damone stops right in front of a seductively posed life sized cardboard stand up of debbie harry the alluring rock singer
damone begins his speech
first of all rat
never let on how much you like a girl
damone turns to the cardboard cutout of debbie harry to demonstrate
turns back to the rat two
always call the shots
he turns to debbie harry who looks on with an inviting cardboard smile
to the rat three
act like wherever you are thats the place to be
to debbie harry debonair isnt this great
to the rat four
when ordering food find out what she wants and then order for both of you
its a classy move
to debbie harry cary grant and the lady will have
to the rat five
and this is most important
when you get down to making out whenever possible put on the first side of led zeppelin iv
to debbie harry seductive why dont you put this tape on
it sounds great in the back of my van
why dont we listen from there
with the same inviting smile
and that is how you talk to a girl rat
you cant miss
i think ive got it
once i get going ill be okay
how do i get started
i mean i hardly know her
its no problem
one person says something to the other and thats how it starts
standing there in the front of the wherehouse the rat nods his head and smiles
hes finally beginning to understand and we
we see the rat behind the wheel of a green volvo
stacy sits beside him
they are driving the streets of ridgemont
this is it
the big date
led zeppelin iv is on the car stereo of his sisters van
thanks for coming to get me
he rounds the corner of luna street off the neon fast food stand that is ridgemont drive
yet another silence has fallen
then after a time
this is a nice car
its my sisters
do you have mrs
george for english
she is pretty good
she is pretty good
they pull into the parking lot of a steak and lobster house called the atlantis
joey at cinema four said this is a pretty good restaurant
ive heard that too
the rat finds a parking spot near the back of the lot grateful that the long silence is over
he walks with stacy to the front of the atlantis
the rat and stacy are escorted by the host to a nearby table
they are given large wooden menus
do you know what you want
i think ill have the seafood salad special
the rat leans back in the booth
he is starting to feel in control now
then something hits him
the panic sweeps across his face
slowly the rat reaches back to check his wallet
are you all right
weakly oh yeah
cool was the name of the game
do you mind if i excuse myself for a moment
not at all
just as the rat is about to get up the waitress approaches the table
are you ready to order here
settles back down she will have the seafood salad special
and i will have
anything to drink
the rat gets back up again looking paler by the minute
he excuses himself and walks over to the pay phone by the atlantis toilets
the rat dials a number
he is sitting in a chair leaning onto the back two legs watching television
what happened to your date
its happening right now
im here at the atlantis
everythings fine except
i left my wallet at home
did you go home and get it
its too late
the food is coming and everything
damone ive got to ask you this favor and ill never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other
will you please borrow your moms car go by my house get my wallet and meet me back here
there is silence
damone are you there
world weary sigh im really pretty busy
as we see the flickering images of leave it to beaver
you owe me for this one
the rat hangs up mildly relieved and returns to the table
the rat and stacy have finished the meal and desert
as it sits in a little tray before the rat
the waitress approaches the table
it is clear she wants to make room for other customers and bigger tips
are you sure theres nothing else i can bring you
ill have one more coke
do you want another coke stacy
have another coke
two more cokes
as mike damone finally walks in
damone looks over the diners then feigns great surprise when he sees the rat
is that you
you come here
i come for the seafood
you know what mark
i found your wallet the other day
you want it back
ive been looking for that thing
hey damone have you met stacy hamilton
stacy this is mike damone
stacy smiles politely with the slightest sparkle in her eye as the waitress returns with the two cokes
well ive gotta be running
looking strangely at the proceedings
nice to meet you stacy
nice to meet you
the rat takes a few quick gulps of coke and gets up to pay the bill
as he moves out of camera range we see the strange look on the faces of waitresses and diners
the rat pulls up to stacys house in the cul de sac
he stares straight ahead like a zombie
i had a really nice time tonight
im real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck
the rat nods glumly
i never thought it would happen at the atlantis
do you want to come inside
arent your parents asleep
no theyre away for the weekend
brad and i are watching the house
ill come in
we see a confused but interested look on the rats face
they walk in the front door
the rat stands uncomfortably in the doorway to the living room
wheres your brother
i dont know
want something to drink
well im going to change real quick
i hope you dont mind
i dont mind
stacy turns her back and pulls up her hair
will you unzip me
as the wheels inside his mind start to spin
this cant be what it seems
he unzips stacy past her bra down to the small of her back
its the first time hes ever done anything like that
she walks down the hall to her room easing out of her dress as she walks
she leaves the door to her room open
you can come in if you want
he is completely unsure of himself as he begins to walk down the hall
his heart pounds into his throat
he turns the corner and steps into stacys room
stacy stands there looking gorgeous in an almost seethrough white robe
the rat pretends not to notice
pretty nice house youve got here
puts hands on hips what do you want to do
as he struggles with the memory of damones words
always call the shots
i dont know
do you want to see some pictures
i kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high
how stupid right
stacy goes to her closet reaches up to grab the books from the top shelf
the rat watches her robe slip up her legs
then she sits down next to him
her knee grazes his
it is almost too much for the rat
go for it
we see the rat struggle with the action of putting his arm around her
he almost does but then reacts as she says suddenly
this is me in the eighth grade
did you have mr
looking pained oh yeah
i had mr
her knee grazes him again
does she expect something
look stacy i want you to know that
the rat struggles
try as he might he cant seem to cross the line
he cant make his move
he is woeful as he completes the sentence
ive got to go home
do you really have to go
its getting kind of late
suddenly the rat is seized with ambition
he reaches one hand around her right shoulder and plants the other hand directly on her left breast
it looks something like a wrestling hold
the rat looks at stacy
stacy looks back at the rat
the rat is absolutely frozen
i guess it is getting late mark
she shrugs him off walks him to the door
we see the rats forlorn face as he trudges towards his car
he takes a breath it wasnt that late he really didnt want to leave
the rat turns and begins walking back up the hamilton steps
just as he does so stacys bedroom light clicks off
it was too late
he kicks at his car
you blew it asshole
behind him recklessly speeding towards ridgemont drive is charles jeffersons blue mustang
jeff spicoli is behind the wheel
sitting next to him is little charles l
jeffersons younger brother
theyre smoking grass and holding lowenbrau beers in between their legs
the radio is blasting the music of rick james
hey slow down
this is my brothers car
i thought he was out of town
then dont hassle it
they speed off down ridgemont
seen the new playboy
suzanne somers tits
i like sex
spicoli sees something in the rearview mirror
hold your beer down l
i think its a cop
spicoli slows down
the car behind him slows down
this is a cop
hes definitely cruising me at busting distance
the high beams switch on behind spicoli
what the fuck is this guy doing
the car behind spicoli then advances to the point where it is now almost touching the blue mustang
what the fuck is this guy doing
this aint no cop
the mystery car bumps them lightly from behind
hes gonna scratch my brothers car
the two boys start yelling
high beams fill the mustang with bright light and
then mystery car pulls back then up alongside spicoli and l
on the left
we hear the music on the radio of george thoroughgoods ride on josephine
its a bunch of jocks in a granada
theyre fuckin with us
the drivers of the two cars eye each others
then the granada begins inching over trying to force spicoli off the road
my brothers car
die granada jocks
spicoli guns ahead in a real bullet move and easily overtakes the granada
spicoli is proud of himself
he checks himself out in the rearview and turns to l
would you roll your window up l
its messing my hair
spicoli pulls way ahead of the granada while l
rolls his window up
spicoli looks over to l
and smiles wickedly
now spicoli wants to show off
he pushes the pedal to the floor
we just missed the turnoff to the party
you know the thing i love about mustangs
the steering wheel
spicoli fingers the bubbles in the wheel
with a genuine mustang steering wheel you can negotiate a hairpin turn with ease my man
on the word ease spicoli curls his finger into one of the mustang steering wheel bubbles and whips it clockwise
the idea is to turn off onto a side street and head back to the party
but instead at the moment of the hairpin turn l
is attempting to switch the radio station
spicoli crooks his finger farther into the bubble than he expected
the car swings in a complete circle a circle that includes a bright yellow fire hydrant
the hydrant rips the side of the car open like a can of tuna
there is a silent moment of terror
are you okay
there is silence
outside the smashed car the granada jocks pass spicoli and l
stirs and utters his first words
my brother is going to kill us
hes gonna kill you and then hes gonna kill me
hes gonna kill us
just be glad youre all right
my brother is gonna shit
make up your mind
is he gonna shit or is he gonna kill us
first hes gonna shit
and then hes gonna kill us
will you just relax mon
hes not gonna kill us
my father is a television repairman
hes got all kinds of tools
i can fix this car
you cant fix this car spicoli
waffled and mangled
it is just inches away from scrap iron
i can fix it
as we see ridgemont high gearing up for its big homecoming game against lincoln
we see a series of shots of kids talking about it wagering on the chances of a ridgemont victory
we see the many signs and placards all over school proclaiming ridgemont revenge
we see students lining up to vote for homecoming king and queen in the gymnasium
it is the most spirit that ridgemont has shown this year
from the back of the parking lot we see a crowd around the flagpole
a group of kids are staring at something
they sadly shake their heads at the sight as if they are witnessing a funeral
as we draw closer we see the center of commotion
it is an ugly sight
someone had wrecked charles jeffersons blue scholarship mustang and welded it to the flagpole
spray painted on the side was the message lincoln surf punks rule
the ridgemont football bleachers are full of cheering students
we see the same basic groups from lunch court and many more
the cheerleaders are on the field cindy carr dina phillips and company and their cheerleader husbands sit directly in front of them in the stands
linda and stacy sit in the bleachers with some of the swensons girls
the rat and damone sit several rows above them watching
the teachers sit together in another section
who is again sitting alone in the bleachers
several old lunch court friends pass by on their way to the concession area
where you working
fish and chips place
just a fish and chips place
brad says nothing more
the students look at each other
well be seeing you brad
everyone is cheering the amazing game on the field
charles jefferson is poised on the offensive line
he mutters a string of obscenities at the opposing lincoln player
the ball is snapped and charles jefferson comes directly at the player with both elbows up and angled to hit inside his helmet
the lincoln player is hit and keels over
charles jefferson sets up for another play
the ball is snapped
down falls another lincoln player
jefferson doesnt know who it was who wrecked his mustang but he wasnt about to spare any of them
there is pure madness in his eyes
it has taken him over
the ridgemont points rack up
jefferson is single handedly maiming lincoln for homecoming
we see jeff spicoli and l
sitting calmly in the bleachers watching
i think we may have gotten away clean
the half time gun fires and the score is
even the ridgemont players steer clear of charles jefferson as they return to their locker room
linda and stacy are sitting by the pool dressed in string tie bathing suits
they are listening to the music of tom pettys breakdown playing on the living room stereo
linda luxuriously applies suntan lotion to her chest and legs in long and writhing strokes
stacy reads a book
its called total orgasm
several beats pass
i sent a letter to doug today
ill be so glad when he gets out here
engrossed in book you really ought to look at this linda
theres a drawing on every page
and all these quizzes
its like school
why dont you put your mothers secret book back
linda continues regally applying lotion
listen to this
what are your mates three most erogenous zones
automatic okay penis thats one balls
wouldnt penis and balls be the same category
probably penis mouth and neck
heres another one
the most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first you climax first you and your mate climax together
does that ever happen
but its a nice idea
listen to this
it says most women derive pleasure from sex but they dont have real orgasms
linda stops applying lotion considers that thought
they obviously dont know about doug
linda resumes applying the lotion
stacy continues reading the book
a couple of beats pass
how long does doug take
i dont know
thirty to forty minutes
pause whats doug do in chicago
he works for the airline
hell be out here
youll meet him
stacy looks at linda almost disbelieving
wistful hes no high school boy
there is a noise by the side fence leading into the hamiltons backyard
it is mark ratner and mike damone
they are already wearing swimsuits
we came over to help you with math homework
we figured you needed the help
on such a hot day
stacy quickly stashes the book in a stack of towels beside her
she leans over to linda and speaks confidentially
what do you think
i think theyre both virgins
stacy smiles gets up and goes over to the fence
i didnt ask for any help
did you linda
well thats exactly why i brought some wisk for the jacuzzi
o kay you guys can come swimming
but you have to leave as soon as my mom gets home
mike damone yells banzai
and dives into the small pool
at one end of the pool is the jacuzzi which is separated by a tile wall
damone has already poured the wisk into the jacuzzi and the detergent has created a huge bubble bath effect
damone surfaces and flips into the jacuzzi
stacy looking great in a green bikini sits kicking her legs by the side of the pool
linda stands on the board
she is poised to dive
the rat treads water and stares at both girls
inside the hamilton living room the family stereo plays the music of deep purples woman from tokyo
ill judge your dive
im a champion diver myself
brad arrives home by the side gate and slams it behind him
he is home from a bad day at work
he walks out onto the patio and stands with his hands on his hips
for the first time our former campus hero looks absurd
he is still in his uniform from captain kidd fish and chips it is a blue and white striped pirates of the caribbean outfit complete with black plastic sword at
the side and a ridiculously large ponce de leon esque hat
brad carries the hat under his arm
does mom know you have company
its just linda
and mark from school
brad ignores the underclassmen and notices linda on the board in her maroon bikini
well you guys keep it down
ive got some work to do upstairs
brad turns and heads back inside
he is just out of earshot when they begin talking about him
god he hardly even talks anymore
he hates to have to wear uniforms
stacy breaks the spell by jumping into the water surfacing and flipping over the tile wall into the jacuzzi
she sits next to damone looking mischievous
talking while the others are at the other end of the pool
casually catching sight of them together from the other side of the pool
we can read the emotions on the rats face
he is still taken with stacy but his big moment for her appears to have passed
as they talk
underneath the water her leg accidentally knocks against his
then he feels her continue
damone feels stacys cool hand on his inner thigh
moving upwards stopping just short of the bulge in his trunks
as it loosens and quivers just the slightest bit
this is uncharted territory even for mr
who is now sunning herself by the side of the pool
she rubs her legs against each other slowly enjoying the hot afternoon
who is watching linda from the window in his room
we see him from behind peeking out the curtains
who smiles at damone and flips back into the pool with a splash
damone steals a look down at his swimsuit
hes popped a big one
why dont you get up and do a dive mike
and we know he cant get out of the water yet
i dont think so
not right now
linda for one loses interest quickly
standing by the side of the pool she jams a finger in her ear and wiggles it
ive got water in my ears
do you have any q tips
god i dont think so
better look in the house
linda towels off and heads back inside the hamilton house
she knows how to walk
we see brads room
the carls burger picture on the wall is conspicuously missing
there is music playing from his stereo pink floyds you and me
we see brad
he is kneeling on the bathroom floor his back to us
his green t shirt is on his underwear in a pile on the floor behind him
his arm is pumping slowly
brad is jacking off
it features linda barrett just as she stood on the diving board a moment ago
she is gorgeous
her breasts seem even bigger than usual
her nipples are hard poking through the film maroon string bikini
water rolls slowly down her cheeks into the corners of her mouth
her lips are parted slightly
her eyes are filled with desire as she says
pause you know how cute i always thought you were
i think youre so sexy
will you come to me
in a nice shirt his hair combed back and looking great
he walks to linda
she reaches out and grabs him for a kiss pulling him close
then she pushes him away so he can watch as she carefully unstraps the top of her bathing suit
the incredible linda barretts breasts fall loose
she takes brads hands and places them on her as she begins unbuttoning his shirt
they are just about to fall into passionate lovemaking when we hear
do you have any q ti
the daydream evaporates and we see real life again with an
in the doorway of brads bathroom as she watches the sight before her
trying to cover himself and act nonchalant and keep his back turned at the same time
the words barely escape his mouth
wait just a
i didnt know anybody was in here
linda turns and goes immediately as if she wants to forget what she saw as quickly as possible
she closes the door behind her
it had all happened so quickly so fast doesnt anybody fuckin knock anymore
he slams the toilet seat down and we
the third attendance bell rings and mr
hand strides to the front of the class
he locks the door
then he takes the front of the class and notices something very different
bright and clear eyed sitting in the front row
his hands are clasped in front of him on the desk
his textbook is open to the proper page
hand is suspicious but continues with class
now in spain owned cuba
think about it
cuba owned by a disorganized parliament miles away
cubans were in a constant state of revolt
hand begins pacing the aisles as he talks
in the united states decided to throw a little weight around and
there is a brief sharp knock at the door
hand whips his head around like mcgarrett
he approaches the door like a cat
sweet voice who is it
hand swings the door open out of curiosity
in walks a young man in a mr
pizza delivery shirt
okay who had the double cheese sausage and bologna
jeff spicoli speaks up
the delivery man takes the pizza sets it on the desk as spicoli whips out some crumpled dollars
then he produces yet another crumpled dollar and presses it into the delivery mans hand
for you my man
the delivery man thanks him warmly just as mr
hand rages into the picture
am i hallucinating here
just what in the hell do you think youre doing
learning about cuba
having some food
spicoli youre on dangerous ground here
youre causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time
cool and urbane ive been thinking about this mr
if im here
and youre here
doesnt that make it our time
hand is so furious hes almost shaking
so i thought id order us a pizza
just leave me a lot of bologna
hand snatches up the pizza and starts to throw it in the wastebasket
then he thinks better and heads for the door
he opens it just as a gang of young stoners walk past
theres the pizza
hand pushes the pizza into their hands and slams the door
you better save some for me you swine
and you my friend
ill see you for a two hour detention every afternoon this week
spicoli eases back in his chair shrugs
it was a good idea at the time
brad hamilton looks terribly uncomfortable in his ponce de leon hat and buccaneer uniform
he rings up an order for an older customer
why arent you in school son
i go to school in the mornings
i have a work study program for the afternoon
he bags one final coffee and punches up the amount
here you go
i have it exactly
sets money down good luck
thank you and thanks for coming to captain kidd
brad loosens his buccaneer scarf and starts back towards the kitchen
he is stopped by the sudden appearance of captain kidd assistant manager harold
ill take over the fryer
those boys at ibm need some catch of the day boxes and i told them you would personally deliver them within the hour
ill reimburse you for gas
brad dutifully unhooks his apron to reveal the bottom half of his pirate suit
just write me out a bill
while harold leans down to tally up the fish order brad goes to a nearby employees closet
he has completely perfected the art of changing back into his street clothes and it takes less than a minute
he is just about to finish buttoning his street shirt when harold sees him
hamilton come over here
what is that youve got on
this is how i dress all the time
but you took off your captain kidd uniform
i thought id take it off for the drive over to ibm
its kind of uncomfortable
harold can barely fathom the idea
come on hamilton
youre going over there to represent captain kidd fish and chips
we have stores all over southern california
part of our image part of our appeal is in our uniforms
you know that
you really want me to put all this stuff back on
i think so
show some pride hamilton
as he stands there stoic looking
i dont believe youre asking me to do this but okay
he begins taking off his street shirt
he looks at harold looks at the boxes and returns to the closet
brad is driving down the freeway listening to the music of bruce springsteens out in the streets
he pries open one of the fourteen catch of the day boxes on the seat next to him and pulls out a small piece of fried fish
brad takes a bite
the look on his face says it is the worst piece of shit he has ever tasted
he throws the piece out the window and drives on
brad turns to see a girl smiling at him from another car
it makes his afternoon
he returns the smile with gusto
as she bursts out laughing and drives away
then he realizes that he hasnt taken his ponce de leon hat off
brad drives on
as we see the cruising vessel move down the highway
we see the captain kidd hat go flying out the window
then the plastic sword and the scarf
then a couple boxes of captain kidd fish
then the rest of them
we see brad rip past the ibm building
school is out and kids are leaving campus heading for the parking lot and bus stop
we see mike damone carrying some books walking towards ridgemont drive
he is joined by stacy hamilton who hurries to catch up to him
i cant wait until i can drive next year
i walk every day
its such a drag
get a ride with somebody
sometimes i get a ride with my brother
but he usually works in the mornings and then drives to school himself
what a guy
damone turns to her after a moment all attitude
you know mark ratner really likes you
you like him
mark is a really nice boy
stacy walks along then stops and looks at damone
but i think i like you
they turn the corner
they have arrived at stacys house
there are no cars parked out front
no one is home
do you want to come in for a second
the attitude starts to weaken
after a long pause damone responds
do you have any ice tea
come on in
stacy unlocks her front door they go inside
damone stands in the white linoleum hamilton kitchen
stacy opens the refrigerator door
i guess the annuals are coming in pretty soon
are you going to get one
i dont know
arent you curious to see how your class picture turned out
i know what i look like
stacy places a glass of ice tea in front of him
they are all alone in the house
do you want to take a quick swim
brad probably has some trunks you can borrow
im going to my room to change
damone stares straight ahead
shes going to her room to change
stacy scoots down the hall toward her bedroom
this is great ice tea
in the middle of changing she has caught her own reflection in the mirror
she pauses a moment looking at the young girl looking back
he continues staring straight ahead
from other room you dont have to shout
you can come back here to my room
damone doesnt move
he pretends he doesnt hear
a moment later stacy comes bounding back down the hall in her green bikini
she grabs damone by the arm
come with me
i know theres a suit in the changing room
she pulls him away
they enter the wood panelled changing room next to the hamilton pool
there are two swimsuits hanging from wooden pegs
pick a suit
i dont know
its getting pretty late
she locks the door to the changing room and begins to walk towards mike damone
are you really a virgin
he could feel his leg starting to shake the slightest bit
its okay if its your first time
she gives him a kiss
i feel pretty strange here
because mark really likes you and hes my friend
hes my friend too
she gives him another kiss
he kisses her in return
standing there feeling stacy in her bikini feeling her kiss him damone also felt some of his reservations slip away
youre a really good kisser
so are you
pause are you shaking
are you crazy
it is clear that this is as far as mr
attitude has ever gotten with a girl
stacy takes the initiative rubbing her hands through his hair rubbing his sides kissing his neck then pulling away
whispers why dont you take off your clothes mike
how about both of us at the same time
damone nods and watches as stacy unhooks her top and steps out of her bikini bottom
she stands naked in the shadows of the afternoon sun
she sits down naked on a red changing room couch and gathers her legs up to her chest
she watches as damone struggles with his clothes
hopping on one leg pulling first out of his pants then his jockey underwear
bashfully he goes to sit next to stacy on the couch
they begin to kiss and it quickly escalates into heavy petting
stacy pulls away
i want you to know that its your final decision if we should continue or not
stacy leans back and pulls him on top of her
he enters her and begins pumping so hard so fast that he doesnt notice hes banging the sofa into the wall of the changing room
but just as quickly as damone starts he stops
whispers hey mike
are you all right
i think were making a lot of noise
im really sorry
he has a strange look on his face
i think i came
didnt you feel it
i guess i did
they lay there damone still on top of her on the red couch
as we read the confusion on his face
he is embarrassed a little confused
mostly he just wants to be alone
ive got to get home
ive really got to go stacy
as she looks up at him
she gives him a kiss
damone gets up puts his pants and shirt on
he leaves the changing room
we see stacy sitting at her usual seat and shes wearing a bright spring dress with a slight amount of makeup
she looks at damones seat with anticipation but it remains empty as other students file in
finally she turns to the rat
wheres mike today
todays april th
damone never comes to school on april th
whats april th
its john bonhams birthday
the drummer for led zeppelin
he died a couple years ago
every birthday he stays home and plays everything john bonham ever recorded
its like his own holiday
the bell rings and mr
vargas enters the room with his sanka cup
seated at the desk is mrs
there is a knock at the door
the door swings open
brad hamilton holds out his yellow slip
have a seat brad
brad have you got your list of college applications
well to tell you the truth mrs
orourke ive kind of been putting it off
im not sure what i want to do yet
by rote all right brad
let me ask you like this
if i were queen of the world and i could make you whatever you wanted to be what would it be
i dont know
there is no humor on mrs
i realize its important to have fun in your senior year with your friends but there comes a time when you have to get serious about your future think about
college and put aside all this fun
brad looks up suddenly
you know what mrs
i broke up with my girlfriend this year
i lost my job at carls and two other places
i wake up at to work at then i go to school then i go back to
i have to pay rent you know
my grades havent been that bad and now youre telling me that the fun is over
well im still waiting for the fun to start
brad ill see you when im through with the rest of the seniors
if you want to visit the career office go right ahead
ill talk to you when youre more prepared
brad gathers his books and opens the door to leave
an absolutely exuberant cindy carr pops her head in the door
the bell has just rung and mike damone comes out of youth and law class
he has an absorbed driven look on his face
he walks past the rows of lockers and doesnt even notice as he passes stacy hamilton standing by her locker
she smiles grabs his arm affectionately
damone turns to see her is thoroughly unimpressed
i didnt see you this morning
look im kind of in a hurry
im in a hurry too
i just thought i could say hi to you
he pulls away leaving a bewildered stacy standing by her locker
she grabs some books and hurries in the other direction
the bus pulls up to the front entrance of university hospital
the students file out and collect next to the front door
vargas gleefully addresses the class
this is his favorite field trip
today were going to explore how this hospital works to preserve human life
well be visiting every floor every level where these fine doctors and nurses take care of us in life
and in death
the class exits from a hospital elevator onto another floor
they are now standing outside the maternity ward
we hear the loud noise of babies
over thirty children are delivered here each day
the class moves on
the class exits another hospital elevator
this is part of your third quarter exam and id advise you to take careful notes on what were about to see
a young intern who has joined the class for the last part of their tour
may i just ask you one last time to conduct yourselves with the utmost maturity
the kids are beginning to get very nervous now as they are led down the hall to the cold room
the door to the cold room has only one sign on it
it reads cadavers medical examination only
vargas opens the door and the class seems to gasp
there are six examination tables in the cold room
each of them contains a cadaver covered by a white sheet
vargas has gathered the class around one table in particular
he fingers the edge of the white sheet as he talks
as you know all the bodies in this room are recently deceased human bio structures
a student raises his hand
who are these guys
most of them were derelicts randy
they sold the right for medical examination of their bodies for money
something like thirty dollars i believe
isnt that right doctor miller
twenty five dollars
who turns to stacy
twenty five bucks is pretty good
now this gentleman here is named arthur
arthur died from heart failure last week and we are fortunate enough to view his body in its pristine state
vargas suddenly pulls the white sheet aside and we see the body of arthur
the students eyes widen
others cover their mouths
others begin furious notes
the body of arthur is smallish and withered
it is orange flaky and not quite real looking
a deep cut has been made in arthurs chest
vargas bends arthur upright for a better student view
he gestures to the deep cut made in arthurs chest
the tension mounts
this incision allows us to pull aside the skin covering of the chest cavity and really observe the human organs as they exist in their natural state
and his shrunken face which seems to say please dont
i want all of you to take a look at the chest cavity for just a moment
vargas grabs the two sides of arthurs chest cavity covering and rips it open
here we have the human lungs and heart which you can see is actually located in the center of your chest
with a squish mr
vargas reaches inside arthur and pulls out the human heart for display
the class stands in silent shock
only one comment escapes from any of them
who goes running out of the cold room holding her mouth
the rat runs after her
rat and stacy sit side by side on some orange plastic chairs by a nurses desk
stacy is shook up
i made a fool of myself
dont worry about it
well just stay out here until everyone comes out well blend back in
what about the notes
ill get you the notes
she squeezes his arm
the students file out of the hospital looking like theyve just been through a war
it is night and linda and stacy are watching fantasy island
you see tatoo what this man doesnt realize is that he must one day leave fantasy island
and he must continue his life as an incurable leper
stacy is fighting back tears
linda looks angry
linda jumps to get it
linda obviously is disappointed when she hears a female voice
what did he say
what did you say
how much did it cost
look tell him he can have a relationship with you or a more open relationship with someone else
listen debbie can i call you later
im waiting for doug to call
she plops back on the couch with stacy
ill bet he forgets to call again
she notices that stacy is crying over the tv show
god stacy its not that sad
its just david soul and ricardo montalban
i dont know im just so depressed
everything is just so
linda shuts off the television
you have been acting very strange the last few weeks
i dont know
i just dont feel right
linda sits down next to stacy on the bed
what do you think it is
what do you think it is
it couldnt be
it could be
i had a pregnancy test at the clinic
ill find out monday
i guess it was damone
of course it was damone
if it was ron johnson youd be out to here
im not going to tell him
hes an asshole
i hate him
but it costs money to have an abortion
even at the free clinic
you tell damone to pay for it
its the least he can do
its the guys responsibility too
she puts the tv back on and they watch
you know theres one thing you didnt tell me about guys
you didnt tell me that they can be so nice so great
but then you sleep with them and they start acting like theyre five years old
i didnt tell you that
stacy hamilton is walking towards mike damone on the football field
we see him from a distance timing track runners
whats going on
mike theres something thats been on my mind and i have to tell you about it
he clicks off the time on a runner and then turns to face her
why dont you call me up tonight
i want you to know that im pregnant
as she looks down
they are words she never thought she would be speaking
how do you know its mine
we only did it once
i know its yours
as he realizes she is sincere and he truly begins to panic
you made me do it
you locked the door
you made me do it
you wanted it more than me
she does not flinch
take that back
all right i take it back
he hugs his arms tighter across his chest and decides to try a more mature tact
theres only one thing we can do
weve got to get rid of it
weve got to get an abortion
weve got to get an abortion
my brother art got his girlfriend one once
its already planned mike
its going to cost at the free clinic
doesnt sound free to me
pause so you want me to pay for it
bites back tears seventy five dollars
and a ride to the clinic
seventy five dollars and a ride
stacy stands there hands folded nodding
he is working at his desk counting through a wad of money
in front of him which has a split line down the middle
people who owe me fifteen dollars rick
people i owe seventy five dollars reo speedwagon tickets seventy five dollars abortion
damone counts fifteen dollars into his stack crosses out rick
then he counts through the money
seventy five dollars exactly
he crosses out reo speedwagon tickets
this leaves him no money for the abortion
here at the same corner where she once waited for ron johnson stacy waits for damone
cars pass no damone
stacy is on the phone calling damone
we see the phone messages sheet that lists two calls for stacy and none for brad
the line rings four times then its answered
is mike there
stacy sags disbelieving and looks at the clock on the kitchen wall
its getting late
he says hes helping his father in the garage and hell call you back
stacy is stunned
stacy hangs up
she punches out another number quickly
is linda there
she went off to the beach
shell be back later though
she looks at the clock again then hears a noise in the driveway
hey wait a second
she runs out
brad and stacy pull up next to the flea market
this is it
i have some shopping to do
see you later
thanks a lot brad
i really appreciate it
she gets out of the car
stacy hamilton watches her brother drive away
then she looks to both sides and walks on
she passes the entrance to the flea market
she walks around the corner to another building marked birth control free clinic
brad follows her in the rearview mirror
stacy is lying in bed wearing a paper dress
her hair is stuffed in paper shower cap
she looks anxious
in a bed next to her an older girl is being affectionate with her visiting boyfriend
a nurse comes in with an iv
this is going to prick a little
she sticks the needle into stacys hand
stacy looks pained but doesnt yell
the nurse pats the rolling bed
now scoot over here
stacy moves onto it
looking up from her point of view we see the ride out of the room and into stacy gets wheeled in
the doctor looks down at her
hello stacy im doctor bartell
stacy moves onto the operating table as the nurse and doctor get ready
any questions before we begin
this is going to hurt isnt it
well use a local but youll feel some pressure
it doesnt last that long
does it hurt more to have a baby
the doctor pauses and considers her question
but i think you mind it less
stacy looks up at the lights and listens to the sound of suction tubes
the other girl and stacy sit at a table eating toast and jelly
the girl is reading
the nurse enters
how are we doing in here
debbie ready to leave
the girl nods and gets up
right through here
stacy i cant let you go unless you have a ride home
uh my boyfriend said held be waiting downstairs
the nurse studies her decides shes telling the truth and allows her to leave
stacy walks back out into the sunlight slowly and weakly
she is surprised and amazed at who she sees standing outside waiting for her
he stands hands on hips just outside the door
he puts an arm around her and leads her toward his waiting car
since when do you shop at the flea market anyway
please dont tell mom and dad
he helps her into the cruising vessel
he starts up the car and drives off
who did it
stacy stares out the window
tears well in her eyes
youre not going to tell me are you
all right then
its your secret
stacy smiles at brad
brad smiles back
the car drives on
stacy is in lindas room sitting on her bed
her eyes are red and moist from crying
linda listens to her story
i really thought he would show up
that little prick
then i called his house and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father
that little prick
i paid for it and everything
there goes your stereo for another year
mike damone is a no brain little prick
im not letting him get away with this
dont do anything linda
id rather just forget about it
i dont even like the guy
stacy hes not a guy
loud hes a little prick
stacy lies back on the bed
the front door to the damone house opens and out walks mike damone carrying some books
he looks troubled burdened and stares down at the walkway as he moves towards his car
he walks around starts to pen the car door then he sees it
there in white spray paint across the drivers door is the message prick
he looks both ways and starts back towards the house
mike damone travels down ridgemont drive making the turn into the school parking lot
there is a large cardboard panel taped on the side of his car
he arrives at his locker where in white spray paint there is another message little prick
several girls walk by they laugh knowingly
damone backs up against the locker with a sick smile on his face
more students pass looking strangely at the young man pinned against his own locker
damone exits the boys locker room
just as he does he is accosted by the rat
we have never quite heard this tone in the rats voice before
what happened between you and stacy
damone feigns the attitude shakes his head
let me tell you something rat
sometimes girls just go haywire
it was a month ago ive been trying to think of a way to tell you ever since
we started messing around and
shrugs something happened
its all over with
its no big deal
i never called her again
the rat says nothing
if you ask me shes pretty aggressive
you understand what im saying
i dont understand
she wasnt really your girlfriend anyway
hey fuck you damone
theres a lot of girls out there and you mess around with stacy
what have you got to prove
i always stick up for you
whenever people say aw that damone is a loudmouth and they say that a lot i say you just dont know damone
when someone says youre an idiot i tell them damones not an idiot
you just dont know him
well you know damone maybe they do know you pretty good
and im just finding out
damone starts to push past him but the rat shoves his shoulder hard
all right rat
you want to do something about it
damone begins the classic high school fighting ritual
he throws his books down
he takes a step back
he goes into a crouch
he gestures towards himself
then damone says the universally recognized high school fighting words
well come on
the rat shows no fear
as other kids begin to crowd around the two boys rat throws his own books down
he takes a step back goes into the crouch
he gestures toward himself
you come on
they stand there gesturing neither one of them wanting to make the first move
you come on you wuss
assistant coach mr
sexton comes running out of the boys locker room and steps in front of the two boys
knock this crap off
the rat stalks off disappearing into the crowd of onlookers
the ridgemont drive strip is filled with cars cruising for parties
there is a lot of honking and yelling out windows
everyone is headed towards the beach
we stay on a lowly store near the freeway entrance
a yellow firebird slowly menacingly cruises the empty parking lot
it does not stop
then around the corner walks jeff spicoli
we see him in the neon light his hands stuffed deep into the pockets of baggy jeans
he walks inside the store
he is the only shopper
brad hamilton stands behind the counter in a red and white striped shirt and cap making fresh coffee
jeff spicoli trudges up to the counter
he looks at brad
brad looks at spicoli
there is an unspoken edge between them
hey mon can i use the bathroom
brad squints his eyes looks at the sign on the back room door
sign which reads rest room for employees only
just make it quick
its the first door on your left
spicoli disappears into the back room
brad sighs looks at the clock
then he hears spicoli from the back room
i cant find it mon
its the first door on your left
on the ledge
first door on your left
there it is
brad sighs again
he loads a new filter into the coffee maker
a moment later the yellow firebird pulls into the parking lot
a man in a windbreaker comes hurtling out of the car into the store
he spray paints the scanning camera above the door
he hustles up to the counter produces a
magnum and points it chest high at brad
there is a glazed and nervous speedy edge to his voice
i want money
and i want it all now
brad looks pale and young under the fluorescent light
he speaks slowly
they empty and close the big safe here at midnight
getting tougher i know this store
i know where the safe is
he bangs the gun on the counter hard
over there behind the donut case
brad slowly moves to the donut case like a zombie
im instructed to tell you that we are on a video alarm system and there are other hidden cameras in the store
just give me the money
legs are shaking i just started here and they just taught me the procedure
ill give you the money just let me figure this out
very menacing move it
brad opens the phony back of the donut case and fiddles with the strongbox combination
more menacing lets go stupid
brad looks at the gunman
get off my fuckin case
the robber is about to react when the bathroom door opens and jeff spicoli starts out wiping his hands on his pants
no towels mon
the robber turns to look at spicoli and that is all that brad hamilton needs
just like it is the most natural thing in the world brad reaches for the hot steaming coffee pot he has just made and throws it into the gunmans face
falls out of his hand and rattles to the floor
the gunman is still grabbing his face and looking at his skinless hands in horror when brad snaps up the gun
in the parking lot the gunmans accomplice poised behind the wheel of the yellow firebird spots the foul up and screeches out of the parking lot
there goes your ride home
brad pulls the under counter alarm with newfound confidence
jeff spicoli stands there mesmerized at the entire event
kids are pouring into the ridgemont mall
summer banners are already up
in the midst of all the kids and shoppers we see the rat walking slowly down the promenade
he is wearing an army surplus jacket and his hands are buried deep in his pockets
two girls pass his way
one smiles briefly at him and the rat turns to watch her pass
he is about to say something to her then no
he walks on sees swensons ice cream parlor up ahead
the rat decides to walk the other way
the place is busy again filled with shoppers and teenagers in summer type clothing
we see stacy hamilton once again at the cash register wearing an assistant manager name tag and a hostess gown
she handles a customers bill then stands there a moment looking glum
linda barrett approaches
another summer of working at swensons
theres lots of men around here
keep your eyes open
you know linda
ive finally figured it out
its not sex i want
anyone can have sex
what do you want
i want romance
romance in ridgemont
we dont even get cable tv
the back kitchen door which swings open and out comes mike damone in a peppermint swensons shirt
he wipes some grime on his pants
you have a mess on c
i just cleaned b
give me a break
the two girls smile go back to their posts
jeff spicoli sits in his room and it is his castle
clothes lie in disarray on the floor
a huge half waxed surfboard is propped against the window
we see spicoli dressed in a too large white short sleeved shirt attempting to tie his fathers fat paisley tie
he stops to take a hit from his bong all the while talking on the phone
the music of lynyrd skynyrds freebird plays on the radio
what is in this shit
pause doesnt that stuff cause brain damage
spicoli listens for a moment
he rubs his eyes shakes his head
he is really buzzed
hey mon i am going to mexico as soon as school is out
two more weeks bud
week from wednesday
pause i am gonna take both boards my duck feet many cases of beer and just jam
pause no mon from school
im leaving as soon as school gets out
ill be at sunset cliffs by nighttime
spicoli hangs up and concentrates on tying his tie
he almost strangles himself
then suddenly the door to his room flies open and spicolis little brother curtis bursts in
jeff you have company
go away curtis
if you cant knock i cant hear you
curtis slams the door and leaves
a moment later there is a knock
the door swings open and jeff spicoli sits in stoned shock at the sight before him
there standing in the doorway of his room is mr
thats right jeff
mind if i come in
spicoli can only nod
calling downstairs thank you mr
hand walks into spicolis room takes off his suit jacket and lays it on the chair back
he stops a moment and catches the stare of miss january penthouse on the wall then turns to spicoli
were you going somewhere tonight jeff
the graduation dance mr
its the last school event of the year
im afraid weve got some things to discuss here jeff
did i do something wrong mr
hand removes several copies of oui magazine from another chair and sits down
he sets his briefcase on spicolis dresser next to a bag of pot and opens it up for easy access
do you want to sit there jeff
i dont know
i guess so
you sit right here on your bed
ill use the chair here
pause as i explained to your parents just a moment ago and to you many times since the very beginning of the school year i dont like to spend my
time waiting for late students or detention cases
id rather be preparing the lesson
hand takes a sheet from his briefcase and looks at it
according to my calculations mr
spicoli you wasted a total of eight hours of my time this year
and rest assured that is a kind estimate
he returns the sheet to his case and looks into spicolis weed ravaged eyes
spicoli comes a rare moment for me
now i have the unique pleasure of squaring our account
tonight you and i are going to talk in great detail about the davis agreement all the associated treaties and the american revolution in particular
now if you can just turn to chapter of lord of truth and liberty
hey its in my locker mr
well then im glad i remembered to bring an extra copy just for you
hand reaches in his case and produces the book
he hands it to spicoli
wearily spicoli is trying to grasp the material
so like when jefferson went before the people what he was saying was hey we left this place in england because it was bogus and if we dont come up

his lips crinkle at the ends

youll probably squeak by
hand has now gathered all his material and he stands to approach spicolis door
jeff jumps up extends his hand
hand exits the room and descends the staircase of the spicoli household
spicoli kicks the door shut grins and continues struggling with his tie
tight angle on the emotion filled face of the lead singer in a cheesy high school band called the t birds
he is bathed in a blue light singing the last verse of the eagles take it to the limit
we pull back to reveal a large clumsy banner reading last dance
students are pouring into the gym for this event
many have brought their annual yearbooks
on stage the lead singer snaps his fingers and the band goes into nick lowes heart of the city
some students start to dance
every one of our characters is either here or about to arrive
from charles jefferson to spicoli to mr
for once all classes are partying together
but just as in the beginning of the year on lunch court the kids are still cordoned off into their distinctive cliques
at the last dance
they see mr
hand signing annuals by the door
they all say the same thing as they pass aloha mr
he nods in return
surveying the growing mob of annual crazed students
from behind her comes linda barrett in a low cut black dress

damone is standing talking to several girls gesturing and being damone mr

they walk away

sprawled out in the bleachers with his surfer stoner buddies
he turns to one admiring stoner todd
sign my annual
spicoli slips the annual into the kids crotch
the stoner winces in pain but still opens the book and lingers on all the signings in spicolis annual
they are all drug related messages from fellow stoners
after a moment spicolis friend signs thanks for the reds
hey mon good thing were going to mexico this summer
cause youre gonna get kicked out of your house when your parents read your annual
brad hamilton pushes both doors open and makes his entrance into the last dance
there is a lot of activity going on but all nearby eyes turn to brad as he walks into the dance
fifteen kids immediately gravitate towards him
they all want brad to sign their annuals to talk about the incident
onstage the t birds play the beatles it wont be long
we see brads old girlfriend lisa push up to him
her new jock boyfriend holds a protective arm around her
i saw your picture in the paper

lisas boyfriend pulls his arm tighter around her

brad leaves his old buddies
he grins and notices someone across the crowded dance floor

they laugh flip him off
brad is back in his element at last
he moves into the main dancing area works his way across the room past the bleachers when he hears a voice
brad turns around seen spicoli sitting on the bottom rung of the bleachers
spicoli looks back with true respect
he throws brad his annual
brad gives him his
where several couples are passionately making out
four teachers clomp up into the stands from different angles
they pin the couples in flashlight beams like the main tower pinning an escaping prisoner
onstage singing the rolling stones im free
we see jeff spicoli leave the dance and come backing down the stairs with a stoner bud
his fist is in the air
he turns to his stoner bud
lets roll my man
spicoli backs right into a young buzz cut kid
watch yourselff spicoli turns around to see hes backed into a squad of eight lincoln surf nazis
they are all standing on the steps waiting
are you jeff spicoli
spicoli looks up and down the row of surf nazis
on the end he sees l
he did it
hey mon i dont know what your trip is but
spicoli dashes off down luna street
and the surf nazis take out in hot pursuit chasing him through the parking lot past ridgemont high and into the night
they will never catch him
school is out and its summer business as usual at the ridgemont mall
we see the same stores the same packs of kids roaming the three tiers
who stands against the railing in his cinema four jacket gazing across the mall at swensons ice cream parlor
he sees stacy walk two girlfriends to the outdoor front tables and almost look his way
the rat turns away suddenly
then he hears her calling out after him
ratner turns around affects total and complete cool
he waves across the mall to her
come over here
he looks back at his post at the theatre decides its okay to step away
he walks across the mall
stacy is standing by the sundae bar
next to her are two empty stools
after a moment we see the rat plop onto one of the metal stools
he pounds the seat next to him with the palm of his hand
stacy turns to look at him smiles
how are you
mark im so glad you came over here because i want you to know something
i just thought i would tell you that i really enjoyed getting to know you this year
the rat maintains the attitude
about fifty people i didnt know wrote that in my annual
i know everybody says it but i really mean it
the rat looks at her from the corner of his eyes
i want you to have this picture so you wont forget what i look like
and so youll remember to call me over the summer
she withdraws a picture from her pocket hands it to the rat
well i dont know i may be doing some traveling this summer
i dont know how much ill be around
breaks down takes picture but ill give you a call sometime
id like that
she gives him a kiss on the mouth gets up and walks away
the rat sits there smiling at the way things sometimes turn out
he slips the picture into his pocket a satisfied young man
the rat is joined by mike damone who has changed into his street clothes
she wants it rat
the rat snickers shakes his head
i saw you
you had pure attitude
the rat turns to look at his friend
the attitude damone is only good until you meet the right girl
whatever you say rat
they take off together blending into the crowd of kids walking the mall
you can only tell its the right girl if youre sensitive
sensitive what is that
sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking
so what makes you so sensitive
well for one i read
i dont watch as much television as you
im trying to feel things more
im learning a lot about people
what do you read
whats the last book you read
lust for life
its the story of vincent van gough
scoffs yeah well i saw the movie
that must mean im sensitive too
its a way damone
its a vibe
i put it out and i have personally found that girls do respond
damone laughs shoves him hard
we lose sight of the two boys in the sea of kids
of ridgemont center mall with music
