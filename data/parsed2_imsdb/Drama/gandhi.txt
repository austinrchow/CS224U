written by john briley final draft the camera is moving toward an indian city
we are high and far away only the sound of the wind as we grow nearer and nearer and through the passing clouds these words appear no mans life can
be encompassed in one telling
there is no way to give each year its allotted weight to include each event each person who helped to shape a lifetime
what can be done is to be faithful in spirit to the record and to try to find ones way to the heart of the man
and now we are approaching the city the squalor of the little shanty dwellings around the outskirts the shadows of large factories
and as we move nearer coursing over the parched terrain the tiny fields of cultivation strands of sound are woven through the main titles borne on the wind images from
the life we are seeking british who the hell is he
lower class british i dont know sir
my name is gandhi
a womans voice tender soft you are my best friend my highest guru
and my sovereign lord
a man gandhi i am asking you to fight
an angry aristocratic english voice at home children are writing essays about him
the sound of massed rifle fire screams
and now we are over the city coming in toward a particular street in the affluent suburbs of new delhi
there are a few cars it is and we are closing on a milling crowd near the entrance to one of the larger homes
we see saris indian tunics a sprinkling of gandhi caps several tongas two wheeled horse drawn taxis
the shreds of sound continue american woman flirtatious intimate youre the only man i know who makes his own clothes
the sound of rioting womens cries and screams of terror
an american voice this man of peace
and as the titles end we begin to pick up the sounds of the street
an australian and his wife a bbc correspondent
all in passing as the camera finally closes and holds on one young man godse
godse steps from a tonga as the crowd begins to move toward an entrance way at the back of a long wall
he will be saying prayers in the garden just follow the others
in contrast to those about him there is tension in godses face an air of danger in his movements
he glances at two policemen who are talking casually absorbed in their own gossip then he looks back at another tonga that pulls up just behind his
two young men apte and karkare meet godses gaze and again we get the sense of imminent danger
they descend and pay their driver absently their eyes watching the crowd
sitting along in the shadows of a stationary tonga a little distance down the street an elderly man prakash with a short close cropped beard and the taut sunken flesh
of a cadaver is watching
apte and karkare look back at him
there is just the slightest acknowledgment and then prakash lifts his eyes to the gate as though to tell them to be about their business
godse hesitates before approaching the two gardeners who nonchalantly flank the entrance
he stiffens himself cautiously touches something under his khaki jacket then glances back at the stoic face of prakash
prakashs gaze is as firm and unrelenting as a deaths head
godse turns back wetting his lips nervously then moves into the middle of a group going through the gate
a fairly numerous crowd is gathering here informally filling the area on one side of a walk that leads to a little pavilion some devout some curious some just eager
to be near the great man
godse moves forward through them toward the front just as hushed voices begin to remark i see him
here he comes
which one is manu
apte and karkare move to different sides of godse staying a little behind their movements sly and wary aware of people watching
we see him distantly through the crowd
the brown wiry figure cloaked only in loincloth and shawl still weak from his last fast and moving without his customary spring and energy as he is supported by his
two grand nieces his walking sticks manu and abha
we do not see him clearly until the very last moment only glimpses of him as he smiles and exchanges little jokes with some of the crowd and the two
young women who support him occasionally joining his hands together in greeting to someone in particular then once more proceeding with a hand on the shoulder of each of the girls
the camera keeps moving closer and the point of view is always godses but gandhi is always in profile or half obscured by the heads and shoulders of those in
we hear the occasional click of a camera and we intercut with shots of godse moving tensely up through the crowd of apte and karkare on the periphery of the
crowd watching with sudden fear and apprehension like men paralysed by the presence of danger
he slides through to the very front rank
his breathing is short and there is perspiration around the sides of his temples
and now for an instant we see gandhi close from his point of view
he is only a few steps away but turned to speak to someone on the other side and manu half obscures him
godse swallows dryly tension lining his face then he moves boldly out into gandhis path bumping manu knocking a vessel for incense from her hands
gently brother bapu is already late for prayers
ignoring her his nerves even more taut godse joins his hands together and bows in greeting to the mahatma
and now we see gandhi in full shot
the cheap glasses the nut brown head the warm eager eyes
he smiles and joins his hands together to exchange godses greeting
godse moves his right hand rapidly from the stance of prayer to his jacket in an instant it holds a gun and he fires point blank at gandhi loud startling
gandhis white shawl is stained with blood as he falls
amid the screams and sounds of chaos we dissolve through to close shot
soldiers feet moving in the slow step half step step of the requiem march
the huge funeral procession crowds such as have never been seen on the screen massed along the route
people everywhere clinging to monuments lamp standards trees and as the camera pulls back from the funeral cortege it reveals more and more
all are silent
we only hear a strange rhythmic shuffling pierced by an occasional wail of grief
we see the soldiers and sailors lining the route their hands locked together in one seemingly endless chain
we see the two hundred men of the army navy and air force drawing the army weapon carrier that bears the body of gandhi
and finally we see gandhi lying on the weapon carrier surrounded by flowers a tiny figure in this ocean of grief and reverence
commentators from all over the world are covering the ceremony
we concentrate on one let us say the most distinguished american broadcaster of the time edward r
murrow who sits on the makeshift platform a microphone marked cbs before him describing the procession as technicians and staff move quietly around him
clipped weighted the object of this massive tribute died as he had always lived a private man without wealth without property without official title or office
as the cortege continues on its way we get shots of the marching soldiers of the faces of sikhs and tamils anglo indians moslems from the north marathas from the
south blue eyed parsees dark skinned keralans
mahatma gandhi was not a commander of great armies nor ruler of vast lands he could boast no scientific achievements no artistic gift
yet men governments and dignitaries from all over the world have joined hands today to pay homage to this little brown man in the loincloth who led his country to
we see the throng following the weapon carrier bier of gandhi as it slowly inches its way along the kingsway
mountbatten tall handsome bemedalled walks at the head of dignitaries from many lands
and behind them a broad mass of indians
for a moment we see their sandalled feet moving along the roadway and realize their quiet rhythmic shuffling is the only noise this vast assemblage has produced
pope pius the archbishop of canterbury president truman chiang kai shek the foreign minister of russia the president of france
are among the millions here and abroad who have lamented his passing
in the words of general george c
marshall the american secretary of state mahatma gandhi had become the spokesman for the conscience of mankind
in the crowd following the bier we pick out the tall english figure of mirabehn dressed in a sari her face taut in a grief that seems ready to break
like the ganges in flood
near her a tall heavy set man germanic still powerful of build and mien though his white hair and deep lines suggest a man well into his sixties kallenbach
he too marches with a kind of numb air of loss that is too personal for national mourning
on the edge of the street an american newspaperman walker watches as the bier passes him
he has been making notes but his hand stops now and we see the profile of gandhi from his point of view as the weapon carrier silently rolls by
it is personal close
walker clenches his teeth and there is moisture in his eyes as he looks down
he tries to bring his attention to his pad again but his heart is not in it and he stares with hollow emptiness at the street and the horde of
passing feet following the bier
a man who made humility and simple truth more powerful than empires
and albert einstein added generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this ever in flesh and blood walked upon this earth
the camera picks out those who ride on the weapon carrier with gandhis body
the stout blunt but now shattered patel gandhis son devadas the strong almost fierce face of maulana azad now angry at the gods themselves
and finally pandit nehru a face with the strength of a hero the sensitivity of a poet and now wounded like the son of a loving father
but perhaps to this man of peace to this fighter who fought without malice or falsehood or hate the tribute he would value most has come from general douglas mcarthur
if civilization is to survive the general said this morning all men cannot fail to adopt gandhis belief that the use of force to resolve conflict is not only wrong but contains within itself the germ of our own self destruction
a news truck is parked in the mass of the crowd
as the cortege nears the photographers on it stand to snap their pictures
there is a newsreel crew center
the camera features a woman photographer margaret bourke white who sits with her legs dangling over the side of the truck her famous camera held loosely in her hand un
regarded as she watches the body of gandhi approach
the intelligent features are betrayed by the emotion in her eyes
for an instant we see gandhi from her point of view and read the personal impact it has on her
perhaps for the rest of us the most satisfying comment on this tragedy comes from the impudent new york pm which today wrote there is still hope for a world
which reacts as reverently as ours has to the death of a man like gandhi
the camera is high and we see the cortege from the rear moving off down the vast esplanade its narrowing path parting the sea of humanity like a long trail
across a weaving plain
and as the shuffling sound of sandalled feet fades in the distance we dissolve through to with the camera high we see a railroad track stretching out across a darkly
verdant plain and suddenly the whistle of a train as its engine and light sweep under the camera startling us as it sweeps across the moonlit landscape
tracking with the train
we begin at the guards van dwelling for a moment on the words south african railways then pass on to the dimly lit third class coaches in the rear of
the train moving past the crowded blacks and indians in the spare wooden accommodation
there are two or three such coaches then a second class coach
cushioned seats better lighting a smattering of europeans farmers clerks young families
their clothes indicate the date the early s
the conductor is working his way through this coach checking tickets
the track continues to the first class coach linen over the seats well lit luxurious compartments
we pass a single european and then come to rest on the back of a young indian dressed in a rather dandified victorian attire and reading as a black porter
stows his luggage
featuring the young indian
it is the young gandhi a full head of hair a somewhat sensuous face only the eyes help us to identify him as the man we saw at birla house
the figure on the bier in delhi
he is lost in his book and there is a slight smile on his face as though what he reads intrigues and surprises him
he grins suddenly at some insight then looks out of the window weighing the idea
as he does the european passes the compartment and stops dead on seeing an indian face in the first class section
the porter glances at the european nervously
gandhi pivots to the porter holding his place in the book missing the european who has moved on down the corridor altogether
we see the cover of the book the kingdom of god is within you by leo tolstoy
tell me do you think about hell
stares at him blankly hell
the eternal earnest sophomore no neither do i
he points abruptly to the book but this man is a christian and he has written the porter has glanced down the corridor where from his point of view we
can just glimpse the european talking with the conductor
excuse me baas but how long have you been in south africa
puzzled a a week
well i dont know how you got a ticket for he looks up suddenly then turns back quickly to his work
gandhi glances at the door to see what has frightened him so
the european and the conductor push open the door and stride in
here coolie just what are you doing in this car
gandhi is incredulous that he is being addressed in such a manner
why i i have a ticket
a first class ticket
how did you get hold of it
i sent for it in the post
im an attorney and i didnt have time to hes taken out the ticket but there is a bit of bluster in his attitude and it is cut off by
a cold rebuff from the european
there are no colored attorneys in south africa
go and sit where you belong
he gestures to the back of the train
gandhi is nonplussed and beginning to feel a little less sure of himself
the porter wanting to avoid trouble reaches for gandhis suitcases
ill take your luggage back baas
no no just a moment please
he reaches into this waistcoat and produces a card which he presents to the conductor
you see mohandas k
gandhi attorney at law
i am going to pretoria to conduct a case for an indian trading firm
didnt you hear me
there are no colored attorneys in south africa
gandhi is still puzzled by his belligerence but is beginning to react to it this time with a touch of irony
sir i was called to the bar in london and enrolled in the high court of chancery i am therefore an attorney and since i am in your eyes colored
i think we can deduce that there is at least one colored attorney in south africa
the porter stares amazed
smart bloody kaffir throw him out
he turns and walks out of the compartment
you move your damn sammy carcass back to third class or ill have you thrown off at the next station
anger a touch of panic i always go first class
i have traveled all over england and ive never
gandhis luggage is thrown onto the station platform
a blast of steam from the engine
a policeman and the conductor are pulling gandhi from the first class car
gandhi is clinging to the safety rails by the door a briefcase clutched firmly in one hand
the european cracks on gandhis hands with his fist breaking gandhis grip and the policeman and conductor push him across the platform
it is ugly and demeaning
disgustedly the conductor shakes himself and signals for the train to start
gandhi rights himself on the platform picking up his briefcase his face a mixture of rage humiliation impotence
the conductor hurls gandhis book at his feet as the train starts to move
gandhi picks up the book looking off at the departing train
a lamp swinging in the wind alternately throws his face into light and darkness
his point of view
the black porter stares out of a window at him then we see the european taking his seat again righteously
the conductor standing in the door watching gandhi even as the train pulls out
then the second class coach with people standing at the window to stare at gandhi then the third class coaches again with blacks and a few indians looking at gandhi
with mystification and a touch of fear
gandhi stands with a studied air of defiance as the train pulls away but when it is gone he is suddenly very aware of his isolation and looks around the
cold dark platform with self conscious embarrassment
a black railway worker looks as if he would like to express sympathy but he cannot find the courage and turns away from gandhis gaze pulling his collar up against
the piercing wind
the policeman who pulled gandhi from the train talks with the ticket taker under the gas lit entrance gate both of them staring off at gandhi
an indian woman near the entrance sits in a woolen sari her face half veiled
a small child sleeps in her arms and there is a tattered bundle of clothing at her feet
she turns away from gandhis gaze as though it brought the plague itself
as if a reverse angle from the previous shot he is angry baffled defiant
but youre a rich man why do you put up with it
we are in a large victorian parlor in a well to do home
facing gandhi are khan a tall impressive indian
singh slighter and older than khan but wiry and looking capable of physical as well as intellectual strength and khans twenty year old son tyeb mohammed
a shrug im rich but im indian
i therefore do not expect to travel first class
it is said with a dignity and strength that makes the statement all the more bewildering
gandhi looks around helplessly
we see mr
baker a wealthy white lawyer whose home this is poking at the fire slightly amused at gandhis naivete
in england i was a poor student but that was england
gandhi is holding a british legal document he lifts it pointedly
this part of englands empire
gandhi you look at mr
khan and see a successful muslim trader
the south africans see him simply as an indian
and the vast majority of indians mostly hindu like yourself there is a moment of blinking embarrassment from gandhi at this mention of his own religion were brought here to
work the mines and harvest the crops and the europeans dont want them doing anything else
gandhi looks at mr
baker almost in disbelief
but that is very un christian
baker smothers a smile
gandhi in this country indians are not allowed to walk along a pavement with a christian
gandhi looks at khan incredulously
you mean you employ mr
baker as your attorney but you cant walk down the street with him
but i risk being kicked into the gutter by someone less holy than mr
he smiles but his eyes show that it is no joke
gandhi glances from one to the other them absorbing the inconceivable
and then almost before our eyes his innocence of the world fuses with his anger at the injustice of it all
well then it must be fought
we are children of god like everyone else
dryly allah be praised
and what battalions will you call upon
i i will write to the press here and in england
he turns to baker firmly and i will use the courts
he lifts the documents threateningly
you will make a lot of trouble
its tone is chilling and gandhis firmness is shaken a little
we are members of the empire
and we come from an ancient civilization
why should we not walk on the pavements like other men
the sturdy khan is studying him with a look of wry interest
i rather like the idea of an indian barrister in south africa
im sure our community could keep you in work for some time mr
gandhi even if you caused a good deal of trouble
gandhi reacts uncertainly
especially if you caused a good deal of trouble
gandhi glances at tyeb mohammed and baker then stiffens plainly frightened by the challenge but just as plainly determined to take it
we see a rather crudely stitched sign indian congress party of south africa
gandhi now sporting a moustache stands with khan and singh near a fire that has been started in the open area before the mosque
a wire basket has been placed on supports over the fire
before them a small crowd mostly indian hindus sikhs muslims but with a few whites drawn by curiosity
gandhi whispers trying to ignore the crowd
theres the english reporter
i told you hed come
we see the english reporter waiting skeptically
near him trying to be inconspicuous on the edge of the small crowd are five policemen one sergeant and four constables
a horse drawn paddy wagon is drawn up beside them
you also said your article would draw a thousand people
if the crowd numbers theyre lucky
at least some of the hindus brought their wives
we see five or six women in saris standing together
i asked my wife to organize that
we feature gandhis wife ba standing at the front of the women
she possesses a surprising delicacy of feature with large expressive eyes and a beautiful mouth but at this moment she is ill at ease and uncertain forcing herself to do
that which she would rather not
alarmed some of them are leaving
gandhi wets his lips nervously
he glances with a little apprehension at the police then takes his notes from his pocket and moves to the front of the fire
he holds up his hand for attention
he forces a smile then starts reading ladies and gentlemen we have asked you to gather here to help us proclaim our right to be treated as equal citizens of
it is flat and dull like someone reading a speech to themselves and those in the crowd who had hesitated before wandering off shrug and continue on their way
gandhi is unnerved by it a little but he struggles on louder but just as colorlessly
we do not seek conflict
we know the strength of the forces arrayed against us know that because of them we can only use peaceful means but we are determined that justice will be done
this last has come more firmly and he lifts his head to the crowd as though expecting a reaction
three or four committed supporters applaud as on cue but his technique is so inexpert that it draws nothing but blank faces from the bulk of them
he glances nervously at ba who is embarrassed for them both now
she wraps her sari more closely around her and her expression is a wifes i told you so sufferance mortification and loyalty all in one
gandhi wets his lips again and takes a square of cardboard from his pocket his pass
the symbol of our status is embodied in this pass which we must carry at all times but no european even has to have
he holds it up
a constable glances at the police sergeant
and the first step to changing our status is to eliminate this difference between us
and he turns and drops his pass in the wire basket over the fire
the flames engulf it
the police sergeants eyes go wide with disbelief
the crowd murmurs in shock
at last gandhi has got a reaction but the dropping of the card has been as matter of fact as his speaking with none of the drama one might expect
from so startling a gesture
even so a constable glances at the police sergeant again do we take him
the sergeant just shakes his head wait
khan moves up to gandhi as the tremor of reaction ripples through the crowd
quietly you write brilliantly but you have much to learn about handling men
he takes gandhis notes from him and faces the crowd
the reading not fluent but firm and pointed we do not want to ignite
the fear or hatred of anyone
but we ask you hindu muslim and sikh to help us light up the sky
and the minds of the british authorities with our defiance of this injustice
it is the end of the speech
he looks at the crowd
no one knows quite what to do
gandhi harumphs gesturing to a shallow box singh holds
kahn turns back extemporizing rather lamely
we will now burn the passes of our committee and its supporters
we ask you to put your passes on the fire with oh no you bloody well dont
he has stepped forward with his constables who have faced the crowd halting the tentative movements of the few committed supporters toward the fire
those passes are government property
and i will arrest the first man who tries to burn one
he is facing the crowd
behind him khan holds himself erect and slowly takes his own card from his pocket
he holds it aloft and then lowers it resolutely into the wire basket
the crowd reacts and the sergeant turns just in time to see it dropped in the flame
take him away
he gestures to a constable who turns from the crowd and marches to khan seizing him by the arm and marching him to the paddy wagon
as he passes the sergeant the sergeant takes his billy club and faces the crowd rapping the club menacingly against his hand
now are there any more
behind him gandhi wavers indecisively a moment then takes the box from singh and moves to the fire
ba holds her hand to her mouth terrified
again the crowds reaction turns the sergeant
gandhi is at the fire
for a second his eyes lock with the sergeants and then nervously he takes a card and drops it in the wire basket and another
you little sammy bastard i he has leapt across the distance between them knocking the box from gandhis hands sending the cards flying and shoving gandhi to the ground
he turns and faces the crowd angrily pointing the billy club threateningly
you want that kind of trouble you can have it
again a murmur from the crowd turns him
gandhi on his hands and knees blood trickling from his abraded cheek has picked up a card from the ground and he leans forward apprehensively his eyes fearfully on the
sergeant but he drops it defiantly in the basket
the sergeants fury bursts and he slams the billy club down on gandhis head
gandhi sags to the ground
she starts to run to him but the other women seize her
let me go
she fights loose but one of the constables takes her firmly
the sergeant turns from the commotion to see that gandhi his head oozing blood has crawled to his knees again and is picking up another card
the crowd watches
the newspaper reporter watches
ba stares in anguish
gandhi lifts the card
the sergeant stares at him angry but his emotions somewhat in control after the first blow
an instant of hesitation then gandhi drops the card into the basket
the sergeant almost stops but he strikes again
a quiver of distaste at his own act crosses his face as gandhi sags
bas anguished face is wet with tears
the newspaper reporter stares without making notes
khan at the paddy wagon watches in wonder
gandhi his head bleeding badly now rises to his knees a breath and he gropes around the ground for another card
his fingers finally clutch one
the sergeant stares his face wracked with uncertainty and confusion
gandhi lifts the card and painfully holds it over the fire then drops it in the basket
the sergeant slams the billy club down again firmly but with a manifest reluctance
the crowd watches breathlessly the newspaper reporter stares
the sergeant draws a breath grasping the club but he bites his lip as he sees gandhi lift his head feebly his shaking hands stained with his own blood groping
for another card
ba is gently removing gandhis suit coat staring fearfully at a bandage on his head another along the side of his face
the room is gaslit overfurnished in the victorian manner
gandhi sits carefully on the bed where some newspapers are spread out english language ones among them
you saved the papers
ba reaches forth gently touching the bandages on his head
i wish you were still struggling for work in bombay
gandhi doesnt take his eyes from the papers but he shakes his head
i hated that all the pettiness the little corruptions
a reflective grin
and i was more laughing stock than lawyer
he smiles whimsically then turns back to the papers
but they needed me here
if id never been thrown off that train perhaps no one would ever have needed me
ba stares at the back of his head wounded by that remark bearing it as stoically as he bore the blows against him
reading a high court judge has confirmed that mr
gandhi would have been within his rights to prosecute for assault since neither he nor mr
khan resisted arrest
i told you about english law
as i told you about english policemen
before gandhi can retort there is a knock on the door
a small round ayah an indian nursemaid pushes open the door and proudly admits her charges gandhis sons harilal ten manilal six and ramdas two
they are all dressed in european suits ties and stiff collars
they step forward one by one making the pranam the hindu gesture of greeting then bending and touching the hands and lips to gandhis feet in the traditional obeisance of
child to father
we are glad to have you back bapu
and i am glad to be back
he holds his hands out to ramdas
and ramdas runs to him and gandhi bends to kiss him as ramdas put his arms around his neck
gandhi pats him indulgently then carefully stands erect looking at them all with satisfaction
tomorrow i will tell you what it feels like to be a jailbird
the two older boys show the expected apprehension and interest
gandhi nods to the ayah
she claps her hands smartly
the boys bow and leave like boys used to household discipline
the ayah closes the door and we hear their chatter at they go down the hall
just like proper english gentlemen
im proud of them
they are boys
and theyre indian
gandhi is stretching out on the bed taking up another paper
will you take this off
he touches the bandage on his cheek it pinches every time i speak
ba comes and sits down on the bed beside him maneuvering so that she can get at the bandage
here you see
even the south african papers apologize a monstrous attack
of the tape as she is about to pull it are you sure
impatiently yes i cant talk like this
ba pauses and looks at him mischievously as though thats not a bad idea
he scowls at her then recognizes her joke and grins
ba pulls one of the strands of tape and gandhi flinches
khan said they called you brave
gandhi is nursing the moustache he looks at her wryly
if you would let me teach you to read you could see for yourself
she leans forward to pull at the remaining piece
i could have told them you were merely foolish
gandhi is watching her as she leans across him her beauty and proximity obviously stirring him
it proves what i told you
if i had prosecuted him as everyone advised even you they would have hated me by showing forgiveness i ouch
she has pulled the other piece
and she slowly pries the gauze free from the strands of hair above his lip
as she does gandhi watches her more and more intently and slips his arms around her back
as though continuing the argument you see there is such a thing as moral force and it can be harnessed
ba examines the bandage and gently touches the wound but she is aware of his burning eyes and arms around her back
you have told me twice now that you were giving up the pleasures of the flesh
it slows gandhi uneasily for a moment and ba must grin at his discomfiture
he leans back still holding her but looking at the ceiling
i am convinced the holy men are right
when you give up you gain
the simpler your life the better
ba makes a moue of acceptance and starts to pull free of him but his arms still hold her
she smothers a smile and lies down her face next to his but neither of them looking at each other
a long beat
and then gandhi turns his head
she is aware of his eyes on her but she doesnt move
gandhi leans forward and touches his lips to her neck
i will fast tomorrow as a penance
still not looking at him she places her hand behind his head gently
if you enjoy it a great deal you must fast for two days
and buries her in love
general smuts sitting erect and imposing on a beautiful chestnut horse rides down a tree lined street
he wears civilian clothes with riding boots and breeches
behind him a junior british officer rides as escort
he turns into the entrance way of an imposing building
the hooves of smutss horse clatter on the cobblestones as the general rides into the courtyard
two sentries come smartly to attention
a stable boy rushes to take the horse and a tall civil servant approaches the general busily as he dismounts
the london papers have arrived from the cape sir
the tall civil servant checks his notes
the worst was the daily mail sir
they said the burning of passes by mr
gandhi was the most significant act in colonial affairs since the declaration of independence
smuts has given the reins to the stable boy
well theyll find were a little better prepared this time
gandhi will find hes on a long hiding to nothing
and he strides into the building past the smartly saluting sentries
gandhi comes from the house door
he carries a briefcase and is still dressed in european clothes though far less elegant than we have seen him in before
his mien the cut of his hair all suggest a passage of time
as he turns he stops because he is face to face with charlie andrews a very tall thin englishman who wears a rumpled white suit and a clerical collar
he has descended from a horse drawn taxi that carries his luggage
he too has stopped
for a moment they both appraise each other neither speaking
then youd be gandhi gandhi nods
i thought youd be bigger
i i mean its all right
it doesnt matter
he suddenly steps forward and thrusts out his hand
im my name is andrews charlie andrews
ive come from india ive read a great deal about you
some of it good i hope
he turns and waves to the parlor window
the three boys are there all bigger and ba holds a new addition they all wave
and gandhi turns back and starts down the long hilly street
to charlie would you care to walk
he gestures charlie on and starts walking
charlie nods uncertainly
he looks back at the cab in confusion then signals the driver to follow and hurries on to match strides with gandhis brisk pace
noting charlies collar youre a clergyman
ive ive met some very remarkable people in india
and and when i read what youve been doing here i i wanted to help
he looks at gandhi then smiles awkwardly
does that surprise you
and now he smiles
at first i was amazed
but when you are fighting in a just cause people seem to pop up like you right out of the pavement
even when it is dangerous or they have come to a turning nearer to town the area poorer run down
ahead of them three youths twenty twenty one in working clothes carrying lunch boxes lean indolently against a building directly in their path
they react to the sight of gandhi fun
then stride the pavement menacingly
one of them tosses aside his cigarette
hey look whats comin
a white shepherd leading a brown sammy
perhaps i should gandhi restrains him and shakes his head
doesnt the new testament say if your enemy strikes you on the right cheek offer him the left
he starts to move forward
charlie hesitates then follows nervously more nervous for gandhi than himself
i think perhaps the phrase was used metaphorically
i dont think our lord meant they are getting closer
the youths laughing whispering
im not so certain
i have thought about it a great deal
i suspect he meant you must show courage be willing to take a blow several blows to show you will not strike back nor will you be turned aside
and when one youth has flicked his cigarette hard
it lands at gandhis feet
he pauses looking at the youth
and when you do that it calls upon something in human nature something that makes his hate for you diminish and his respect increase
i think christ grasped that and i i have seen it work
he starts forward again he is almost on the youths clearly frightened but
get off the pavement you bloody and he reaches forth to haul gandhi from the pavement but colin
what are you doing
a woman is leaning out of an upstairs window looking down at the fracas disconcertedly
it is the first youths mother and her presence reduces the pitch of his hostility considerably
we were just cleaning up the neighborhood a little
a snickering response from the other youths but they are embarrassed by the questioning disapproval of colins mothers attitude
theres no note of apology in her cold stare at gandhi but she clearly believes her son should not be doing what he is doing
youre already late for work
i thought youd gone ten minutes ago
the moment of crisis has passed
nothing will happen while she is there
gandhi steps back on the pavement addressing the first youth
youll find theres room for us both
and he steps around him charlie trailing as the first youth stares at them sullenly
as they stride on charlie glancing back relieved that was lucky
i thought you were a man of god
wittily but making his point i am
but im not so egotistical as to think he plans his day around my dilemmas
gandhi laughs as they turn the corner
a busy street in the center of the town
gandhi and charlie come around the corner into it
you could call it a communal farm i suppose
but weve all come to the same conclusion our gita the muslims koran or your bible its always the simple things that catch your breath love thy neighbor as thyself
he smiles thinking back at the youths
not always practiced but its something we hindus could learn a lot from
he has paused before an office and a young girl sonja has come from it to speak to him about something of urgency but she hovers not interrupting
thats the sort of thing youll be seeking on this farm
a smile well we shall try
and now he turns to sonja
behind her we see the small office m
several clients waits most of them conspicuously poor
sonjas tone is loaded with foreboding
theyre going to change the pass laws
gandhi absorbs the news stiffly
a strong masculine hand scrawls a signature across a document
its taken time but it needed to be done fairly
we didnt want to create an injustice simply because mr
gandhi was abusing our existing legislation
beneath the signature we see the boldly printed identification jan christian smuts
just one second sir please
a cameraman records the moment with a flash photo
general smuts whose presence is equal to his office addresses someone out of shot as a male secretary removes the document
but on a short trip i wouldnt spend too much time on the indian question mr
its a tiny factor in south african life
the reporter who stands opposite him is walker much much younger almost boyish compared to the way we saw him at the funeral
a helpless shrug its news at the moment
i will certainly report on your mines and the economy but i would like to meet this mr
smuts has risen
he knows how to concede with grace
we westerners have a weakness for these these spiritually inclined men of india
but as an old lawyer let me warn you mr
gandhi is as shrewd a man as you will ever meet however otherworldly he may seem
but im sure youre enough of a reporter to see that
the gaze is firm strong cynical
the sides are half up but it is dusty and hot
this is where the magazine indian opinion is printed and we see stacks of it lying around
a short westerner albert west is running the simple printing press which is powered by a crude generator
a small staff helping him
a sikh a muslim a couple of hindus two young boys
gandhi and walker are approaching the tent from the river gandhi discoursing earnestly
so its not spiritualism or nationalism were not against anything but the idea that people cant live together
theyve reached the entrance to the tent and he gestures in
you see hindus muslims sikhs jews even christians
this last remark has been directed toward charlie andrews who sits near them at a cluttered table typing on an old typewriter
he waves and gandhi shouts out to them all over the putt putt of the generator mr
of the new york times
one of the hindus bows with his hands clasped together
gandhi hands walker a copy of indian opinion and they start across the relatively barren field toward some other tents walker glancing at the paper
gandhi watches him grinning
without a paper a journal of some kind you cannot unite a community
a teasing smile
you belong to a very important profession
and what should an important professional write about your response to general smutss new legislation
i dont know
im still searching for a response
a leading question you will respect the law
a beat there are unjust laws as there are unjust men
this carries a weight and apprehension that none of the rest of the conversation has
walker measures gandhi with a little surprise
youre a very small minority to take on the government and the empire
gandhi seems trapped by an ineluctable fact
if you are a minority of one the truth is the truth
reluctant as it is it too carries commitment and walker senses it
but they have come by a site where a building is being erected and a european kallenbach is perched above a doorway on the half completed structure getting a level
some indians are working below him
gandhi turns to him light hearted again
this is mr
he is our chief carpenter and also our chief benefactor
he has made this experiment possible
walker waves his notebook at him and kallenbach lifts his level in greeting
on his bronzed chest there is a star of david
walker looks around grinning shaking his head
we see two women in saris trying to quell some squabbling children in the background
well its quite a place your ashram is that right
the word only means community
but it could stand for village
or the world
walker looks at him appraisingly
youre an ambitious man
uncertainly i hope not
a moment of embarrassed doubt then he starts toward a half finished building wooden sides door but canvas still covering the roof
it has an awning spread before it
walkers carriage is tethered nearby a black driver standing in the sun waiting
in the background we see two women cleaning a latrine
walker glances at the latrine
they tell me you also take your turn at peeling potatoes and cleaning the outhouse is that part of the experiment
as we have approached we see a table set for tea under the awning
there are two places
having set the places ba is walking along the side of the building away from them
she glances at gandhi tautly and deliberately avoids speaking or acknowledging him
a little surprised a little annoyed ba we will need another place set for mr
ba looks at him coldly
i will tell sora
she turns back and walks into the building by the rear entrance
gandhi is disconcerted by her attitude but he tries to answer walker
its one way to learn that each mans labor is as important as anothers
in fact when youre doing it cleaning the outhouse seems far more important than the law
a grin but forced
when a girl sora comes from the building bringing another cup and place setting gandhi calls to the driver
please come and join us youll need something before your journey back
he nods to walker
excuse me a moment
and he goes into the building determined to find the source of bas aloofness
ba is sitting sullenly on a carpet near the rear entrance to the building
she does not look up at gandhi but she is aware of his presence
he crosses and stands in front of her with all the irritation of a husband
it is hushed aware that walker might overhear them but bristling with suppressed anger
what is it
now ba looks at him hostilely
sora was sent to tell me i i must rake and cover the latrine
everyone takes his turn
it is the work of untouchables
in this place there are no untouchables and no work is beneath any of us
she looks up at him i am your wife
all the more reason
he holds her gaze as angrily as she holds his
finally scornfully as you command
as she starts to rise he grabs her arm but she pulls free
the others may follow you but you forget i knew you when you were a boy
she says it derisively and it stings but gandhi is aware of walker and he fights to hold his temper
its not me
its the principle
and you will do it with joy or not do it at all
ba settles back defiantly
not at all then
for a moment gandhi stares at her and she back at him resentfully
he suddenly reaches down and grabs her arm pulling her roughly to her feet
all right go
you dont belong here
leave the ashram
get out altogether
we dont want you
it is hushed but violent as he pulls her toward the rear door opening it to push her out as she struggles against him
what are you doing
she lurches free of his grip glaring at him angrily
for a moment they both stare at each other shattered by their violence
bitterly have you no shame
im your wife
like lead where do you expect me to go
gandhi stares at her breathlessly his temper subsiding into a dazed remorse
he sinks numbly to a stool sitting holding his head in his hands
ba studies him for a moment and she sighs her temper and breathing subsiding too
she moves and kneels before him
what is the matter with me
a moment then she soothes the top of his head like the mother wife she is
a beat you are human only human
gandhi looks up at her blankly abjectly
and it is even harder for those of us who do not even want to be as good as you do
and gandhi grins weakly
ba catches it and sends it back warmer less complicated by doubts
gandhi sighs putting his arms around her and she leans into him so that their heads are touching
ba mutters hm and holds him a little firmer
i must go back to that reporter
and i must rake and cover the latrine
gandhi holds her back so that he can look at her
she looks at him evenly no smile but the warmth still in her eyes
the theater is packed
the front rows near the stage are held by rich muslim merchants the back of the stalls with small traders peddlers artisans muslim hindu parsee sikh
the gallery is bulging with indentured laborers largely hindu
the mood is restless belligerent
on the stage
gandhi moves forward and he holds up his hand for silence
seated on the stage are khan singh three more leaders of the indian community
charlie andrews and herman kallenbach sit at the very end of the line of chairs
gandhi looks around the audience and we see the packed house from his point of view ending with two plainclothes european policemen conspicuous in seats at the end of the
a uniformed policeman stands near them
to the house i want to welcome you all
a buzz then applause loud and defiant
when is subsides gandhi looks down at the plainclothes policemen fixing his gaze on them
every one of you
then still at them we have no secrets
and again the audience bursts into applause
the policemen just sit like stone confident sure immune to rhetoric
let us begin by being clear about general smutss new law
all indians must now be fingerprinted like criminals
men and women
a rising angry response gandhi just waits
no marriage other than a christian marriage is considered valid
under this act our wives and mothers are whores
and every man here a bastard
in the gallery a rhythmic pounding signals the anger and protest and is taken up around the hall
the police stare imperturbably
khan leans towards singh nodding to gandhi
hes become quite good at this
singh smiles at the understatement
gandhi holds up his hand silencing the hall
and a policeman passing an indian dwelling i will not call them homes may enter and demand the card or any indian woman whose dwelling it is
god damn them
gandhi just waits
he does not have to stand at the door he may enter
now a violent response a large powerful merchant rises in the third row
i swear to allah i will kill the man who offers that insult to my home and my wife
a guttural cheer he glares at the police
and let them hang me
when it subsides tyeb mohammed rises near the back where he is seated with a number of other young men
i say talk means nothing
kill a few officials before they disgrace one indian woman then they might think twice about such laws
the police half rise to look back at him but there is a smattering of applause and several stand to look back
in that cause i would be willing to die
and now there is general applause
gandhi waits then i praise such courage
i need such courage because in this cause i too am prepared to die
a response he looks at tyeb mohammed but my friend there is no cause for which i am prepared to kill
he looks at the audience
this is the more sober gandhi they have come to know
i have asked you here tonight because despite all their troops and police i think there is a way to defeat this law
whatever they do to us we will attack no one kill no one
but we will not the climatic point give our fingerprints not one of us
he looks down at the police making the point stick
there is a tentative reaction from the audience but uncertain
they will imprison us they will fine us
they will seize our possessions
but they cannot take away our self respect if we do not give it to them
have you been to prison
theyll beat us and torture us
i say i am asking you to fight
it catches the audience a little holds them
to fight against their anger not to provoke it
he has their attention now
we will not strike a blow but we will receive them
and through our pain we will make them see their injustice quickly and it will hurt as all fighting hurts
but we cannot lose
he looks down at the police
because they may torture my body may break my bones even kill me
up to the house they will then have my dead body not my obedience
and now he gets the response he has wanted
firm mature determined
gandhi holds up his hand
we are hindu and muslim children of god each of us
let us take a solemn oath in his name that come what may we will not submit to this law
he looks at the audience
a second then a merchant stands signifying his pledge
and then another
then tyeb mohammed and the youths about him
then all over the theater they begin to stand and on the stage until everyone is standing
it is all done is silence
gandhi looks at the full theater all standing
he takes a step forward
a coarse singing god save our gracious king
long live our the audience takes it up noble king
and their voices fill the auditorium god save the king
a prison door slams we are close on one face another slam another face and again and again in the rhythm of marching feet
gandhi singh and tyeb mohammed are leading a large procession of indian mine workers along a dirt road from a mining complex sheds elevator platforms pulleys toward a distant city
we see crude handworked banners we are citizens of the empire justice for all one king one law
tyeb mohammed suddenly touches gandhis arm and nods ahead
their point of view
a canvas topped open touring car circa pulls out from a turning between two factory buildings and comes towards them
there is a little hesitation in the ranks as the car approaches
in it we can see two uniformed policemen and a civilian
the car swings across the center of the road and stops right in front of gandhi
these men are contracted laborers
they belong in the mines
you have put their comrades in jail
when you free them they will go back to work
the civilian smiles slowly
he looks from gandhi to the miners
ive warned you
we have warned each other
the civilian looks at him sharply then smiles derisively signaling the car off
as it pulls away tyeb mohammed and singh come up to gandhi both made wary by the mans evident satisfaction with what has transpired
i dont think that is very good
gandhi watches the disappearing car worriedly then turns and signals the miners on
they start forward
their point of view
the car rides on past the factory building out of which it turned and suddenly mounted police come swinging out from the buildings and face the procession
tracking back before gandhi singh and tyeb mohammed as they move forward fear suddenly making their pace more labored
tracking back before the mounted police
at the canter for ward
they come on fast batons at the ready
gandhi screws up his courage marching on
tyeb mohammed sets his jaw in defiance
singh forces himself along at gandhis side
the mounted police riding on batons at the ready
featuring an indian miner
he is in the front rank of the procession watching the horses approach
he has a blunt farmers face
half to gandhi we should lie down the horses wont tramp on us
then shouting out down
everyone lie down
he starts to go down and others around him convinced by the authority of his voice
the sense of the idea seizes gandhi and as the sound of the galloping horses nears he turns and shouts too
and the miners begin to go down some face up shielding their faces with their hands some burying their faces in the earth and covering their heads with their hands
close fast traveling the sergeants point of view
we arrive at the prone miners
close on gandhi his arms crossed in front of his face staring up frightened but determined to bear it
the horses cannot bring themselves to gallop over the human carpet they rear plunge swerve
close shot miner who shouted down
he is peering through his crossed hands a tight smile of satisfaction at knowledge confirmed
he turns to see the sergeant thrown off his horse
he lands heavily scrambles up furious darts after it
mounting he is enraged to hear laughter
singh and the miner who shouted down kneeling grinning at the chaos
the horses have more mercy than the men
singh smiles but suddenly looks up fearfully
the sergeant looms over them
and without taking his booted foot from the stirrup he swings it into the miners face
the man goes down bleeding
an angry roar from the miners
several stand and shake their fists
god damn you englishman
the wounded miner himself starts to stagger up
the sergeant sweeps them his eyes glittering this he can deal with
but lie down
it is a command and angry in its own way but it carries all the weight of his influence on them
they begin to go down again and the sergeant wheels his horse and rides at gandhi
with deliberate almost fatalistic pace gandhi goes first to his knees and then sprawls down flat his hands over the top of his head awaiting the blow of the horses
close shot the horses head its eyes rolling as it swerves again
close shot the sergeant controlling it cursing but unable to make it plunge down on the man
full shot the sergeant wheeling his horse angrily surveying the whole of the procession as they lie sprawled on the ground his mounted police circling in front of them not
knowing what to do
he turns his horse angrily and gallops back toward the factories
gandhi singh and tyeb mohammed are looking off at the retreating horses
the car with the civilian has returned in the distance
gandhi looks at the miner who first shouted down a smile a nod of recognition and thanks
the miner grins rubbing at the blood on his face shrugging off gandhis implied praise
featuring the police
the sergeant wheels by the car with the civilian his police turn their horses lining up across the road again
their point of view
gandhi and the miners coming on once more chanting forcefully
what the hell are we supposed to do now
watching the procession narrowly let them march
in our own sweet time in our own sweet way well get them
we are close on charlie andrews
some of you may be rejoicing that mr
gandhi has at last been put into prison
the congregation is listening to him stiffly unsympathetically and there is more than one murmur of assent at his words
the clergyman who has given charlie the use of his pulpit sits beneath it embarrassed but sticking resolutely to his decision to give charlie a hearing
but i would ask you assembled here in this house of god to recognize that we are witnessing something new something so unexpected so unusual that it is not surprising
the government is at a loss
gandhi has forced us to do is ask questions about ourselves
a few men in the congregation rise and pointedly escort their families from the church
charlie struggles on
as christians those are difficult questions to answer
how do we treat men who defy an unjust law men who will not fight but will not comply
more of the congregation rise and march from the church
though a few pointedly do not
gandhi is threading his way in a line for soup
but it is a line that winds through masses of prisoners some with bowls eating some not yet in the line
as gandhi near the two stone blocks that hold the large barrels of soup he sees that khan is serving from one of them
he too wears a prison uniform and there is a bandage on his head
when he turns and reacts to the sight of gandhi theyre sparing no one i see
you were the surprise
its been all over the prison
we thought theyd be too afraid of the english press
so did i
he takes his soup from khan
acidly dont worry about the meat its hindu referring to the soup theres not a trace
gandhi smiles but they turn as the gate opens and a paddy wagon is backed into the press of prisoners
khan shakes his head
i dont know who theyve left out there to do the work
there cant be one mine left open
have they touched the women
my wife publicly defied the law
theyve arrested her and four others
angrily the fools
he spills some soup
its split the government
well thats one victory
gandhi looks around the crowded yard at the soiled bandages the defiant determined faces
if we hold firm it wont be the last
dont worry ive never seen men so determined
youve given them a way to fight
and i dont think he is distracted by a phalanx of guards an officer and four men pushing their way through the prisoners
i want gandhi
which sammy is it
the prisoners are moving back from them resentfully but their glances reveal who gandhi is
the prison officers eyes fall on him
a side street but active
gandhi now manacled is being marched down the pavement before two guards
the prison officer strides in front of them
people in the street stop and turn staring
that part of gandhi that is still the dandy is discomfited but there is a growing part of him that defies appearances
featuring a doorway
it is the side door of a large imposing building
the prison officer leads his little procession toward it
he knocks and the door opens
the tall civil servant has been waiting for them
the prison officer reaches forward and undoes gandhis manacles
the tall civil servant moving with aloof distaste for his assignment walks ahead of gandhi who in turn is followed by one of the prison guards toward a grand staircase
that is at right angles to them i
facing the front of the building
people working in offices pause to stare at gandhi as he moves along more uncomfortably aware of his prison garb than ever
the grand staircase
the tall civil servant turns and starts up the staircase
gandhi is even more exposed to everyones surveillance on the wide white expanse of the stairway
he hesitates looking around in discomfort then follows the tall civil servant on toward the large white doors at the top of the staircase
the tall white doors open the tall civil servant indicates that gandhi enter
gandhi passes two male secretaries and the tall civil servant scoots decorously around him to knock once on the inner doors
then he pushes them open and gestures gandhi in
we have seen it before when walker spoke to smuts but now we see its full breadth and the imposing figure smuts makes as he stands behind the grand desk
i thought we might have a little talk
he nods to the tall civil servant who bows and closes the door
smuts crosses the room toward a small cabinet
will you have a glass of sherry
smuts looks at gandhi a little surprised at the frigid tone of that refusal
perhaps some tea
a shake of the head i dined at the prison
he appraises gandhi measuring the irony of his words his determination
then with a little sigh at the lost opportunity he replaces the stopper on the sherry turns and gestures gandhi on into the room
please please do come and sit down
its prison i wanted to talk to you about
he has indicated a chair near his desk but as gandhi goes forward he pauses by a spread of papers from england on a long table near the middle of
we see one headline in close shot thousands imprisoned in south africa mines close
crops unharvested a subhead gandhi leads non violent campaign
he looks at smuts
smuts smiles a passing nod at the papers
gandhi ive more or less decided to ask the house to repeal the act that you have taken such exception to
a beat well if you ask general smuts im sure it will be done
of course it is not quite that simple
somehow i expected not
a wry smile and he sits on the edge of the chair smuts has directed him to
smuts measures him again not absolutely certain how to deal with him
a pause and he affects to take gandhis irony at face value
im glad to hear you say that
you see if we repeal the act under pressure a nod at the papers again under this kind of pressure it will create a great deal of resentment
can you understand that
and gandhi does understand it as a guiding principle
never humiliate your enemy
and his tone conveys it
a bit surprised good
the bland politician the compromise
i have thought of calling for a royal commission to investigate the new legislation
he gestures implying theyll do what theyre told
i think i could guarantee they would recommend the act be repealed
waiting for the catch i congratulate them
smuts does a slight double take a smile then the tough politician
but they might also recommend that future indian immigration be severely restricted even stopped
he measures gandhi challengingly obviously expecting some contest
gandhi mulls it then immigration was not an issue on which we fought
it would be wrong of us to make it one now that we we are in a position of advantage
smuts stares at him
a moment then youre an extraordinary man
his grin he brushes at his prison garb i assure you i feel a very ordinary man at this moment
and now smuts smiles with him
he bends suddenly and signs a group of documents
im ordering the release of all prisoners within the next twenty four hours
you yourself are free from this moment
gandhi stands a little uncertain about the sudden change in his status
smuts signs the last document then sees gandhis doubt and misreads it
assuming we are in agreement
its just that
in these clothes id id prefer to go by taxi
confused by his hesitation all right
im im afraid i have no money
he quickly feels in his waistcoat pockets and realizes he has no money
neither have i
he reaches forth and touches a buzzer
im awfully sorry
the tall civil servant daniels enters
daniels would you lend mr
gandhi a shilling for a taxi
i beg your pardon sir
a second thought how far will you be going mr
a mischievous smile well now that this is settled i had thought seriously of going back to india he faces the startled daniel but a shilling will do splendidly for
still a little confused daniels reaches in his pocket and produces a shilling
he hands it to gandhi
to smuts thank you both for a very enlightening experience
he bows slightly and starts out the door
daniels immediately starts to accompany him but gandhi stops
ice im obliged mr
daniels but i will find my own way out
and his own steel shows in the oblique reference to the ignominy of his way in
daniel bows and he and smuts just stare as the uniformed prisoner goes out through the grand doors past the stunned men in the office to the outer doors and
on to the grand staircase
the prison guard appears in the doorway looking off in confusion at gandhi then back at the office for guidance
daniels simply shakes his head let him be
finally when gandhi has disappeared down the stairs daniels turns to smuts
a shake of the head hes either a great man or a colossal fraud
either way i shall be glad to see the last of him
ships siren military band
a jubilant crowd on the pier passengers waving to the receiving crowd
a group of first class passengers ninety percent english look down from the upper deck
from their point of view
we see the main section of the pier a crowd of mostly european civilians on one side
a mass of military on the other european officers topees and swagger sticks indian cavalry gurkha infantry sikh lanoers turbans rifles bugles an indian military band a showy awe inspiring
featuring two englishmen
first class passengers white suits oxbridge accents one quite young the other a bit older both civil servants coming to administer india
by god he loves it
their point of view
a british general is coming down the gangplank accompanied by his adc
the officer commanding and the guard of honor await him
im sure he hates it
the young englishman glances at him quizzically
the general has taken the salute and moves to inspect the troops to the accompaniment of the military band
generals reputations are being made in france today fighting on the western front
not as military governors in india
he is suddenly aware of a well dressed indian half listening to their conversation
he glances at him and the well dressed indian simply nods slightly and moves off a little
the second englishman grimaces at the young englishman and looks down again
what the devils going on back there
he is looking aft
his point of view
another far less elaborate gangplank extends from the aft section of the ship
third class passengers are disembarking here and on shore separated by a wire fence from the rest of the pier
a large crowd of indians is reacting excitedly to someone coming down the gangplank but we cant yet see that person
the young englishman glances back at the well dressed indian to make sure of his distance then speaks quietly
it must be that indian that made all that fuss back in africa
my cabin boy told me he was on board
why havent we seen him
finding the name gandhi
he was traveling third class
there he is
their point of view
there has been a little hiatus in those disembarking but now gandhi has appeared coming down the gangplank with ba and the children grown up sons now and three or
four people behind them including the tall figure of charlie andrews
but gandhi is wearing an indian tunic and sandals and he has shaved his hair except for a central section on the top
god hes dressed like a coolie
i thought he was a lawyer
the young englishman glances back cautiously toward the well dressed indian again then after he came out of jail he refused to wear european clothes
gandhi is smiling trying to move on but answering the questions of an indian journalist
no no i havent refused
i i simply wanted to dress the way my comrades in prison dressed
he speaks with an uncertainty and tentativeness that he had lost in south africa patently overwhelmed by the reception
an english journalist catches him as he turns
will you support the war effort mr
an exuberant woman puts a garland over his shoulders
i i have demanded rights as a british citizen it is therefore my duty to help in the defense of the british empire
he smiles uncertainly again
as he turns he is face to face with an american reporter
what are you going to do now that youre back in india
i dont know
i dont know
an indian reporter has cornered ba behind him
as an indian woman how could you accept the indignity of prison
gandhi half twists to hear bas answer but his arm is taken by a young indian nehru in elegant european clothes
another garland is thrown over his shoulders
offhand her eyes on gandhi ahead
my dignity comes from following my husband
she joins her hands acknowledging a garland placed around her shoulders and pushes on after gandhi
charlie helps to guide her
the young nehru somewhat amused by all the excitement leads gandhi through the crowd to a little flower covered platform
we see a banner the congress party he too speaks with an oxbridge accent just a few words then well get you to civilization
he has guided gandhi to the first step of the platform
another garland is wrapped around gandhis shoulders and in some embarrassment he mounts the platform
there is a great cheer but in the silence that follows we hear the military band from across the way as the troops prepare to march off
gandhi looks around at the crowd
finally he speaks out
i i am glad to be home
a little round of applause
i i thank you for your greeting
he makes the pranam and starts for the steps
the crowd is a little disappointed but they manage a cheer and applause
nehru is standing next to a heavy set well dressed man patel
they exchange a wry glance not exactly a world beater
a car door slams
the camera pulls back
nehru has slammed the door of a gleaming rolls royce touring car the top down
he has seated gandhi in it beside patel taking gandhis knapsack
an indian chauffeur rides in front
the crowd still surges around and gandhi is looking apprehensively back for ba
well follow with your wife dont worry everythings arranged
he grins boyishly in part to comfort in part unable to contain his amusement at gandhi and his evident confusion
with gandhi still looking back anxiously the car pulls off
he finally turns to patel
who is that young man
thats young nehru
hes got his fathers intellect his mothers looks and the devils charm
if they dont ruin him at cambridge wave
he may amount to something
there are crowds along the street and gandhi in surprise that they are for him waves tentatively
patel waves too but he eyes gandhi rather critically
i must say when i first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in bombay i never thought id be greeting you as a national hero
im hardly that mr
oh yes you are
its been two hundred years since an indian has cocked a snoot at the british empire and got away with it
and stop calling me mr
patel youre not a junior clerk anymore
a beat still hesitant no
they have come to a main thoroughfare
a crowd still lines the streets but it is thin and around and between we see groups of desperate poor parked on the pavement staring with blank curiosity at the
passing car but too listless and too out of touch to move from their little squatters patches
patel looks at gandhis clothes rather disapprovingly
the new military governor of the north west province was on that ship
too bad you came back third class he might have been impressed by a successful barrister who had outmaneuvered general smuts
gandhi is staring at the street
from his point of view we hold on a gaunt young aged woman holding a baby wrapped in rags as threadbare as her sari
another hollow faced child leans against her
a splendid peacock its tail fanned in brilliant display lords it on a velvet lawn
a woman in a sumptuous silk sari is trying to feed it crumbs
behind her gandhis reception is in full spate silver trays tables covered in fine linen indian servants a swimming pool a small fountain the grounds filled with indian millionaires and
dignitaries gathered with their wives to meet the new hero from south africa
a beautiful and beautifully dressed woman mrs
nehru stands next to her distinguished husband motilal nehru
wittily no i leave practical matters to my husband and revolution to my son
she nods lightly toward nehru
featuring nehru who is introducing gandhi to two men one tall slender ascetic looking but dressed impeccably jinnah
the other with a haunting face beard flowing dark hair the air of a poet or a ruthlessly dedicated radical prakash whom we recognize from the opening sequence in delhi
at gandhis assassination
jinnah our joint host member of congress and the leader of the muslim league and mr
prakash who i fear is awaiting trial for sedition and inducement to murder
gandhi has bowed to jinnah now he looks a little startled at prakash
prakash grins and makes the pranam to gandhi
i have not actually pulled a trigger mr
gandhi i have simply written that if an englishman kills an indian for disobeying his law then it is an indians duty to kill an englishman for enforcing his law
in a land that is not his
it is a clever argument i am not sure it will produce the end you desire
he meets prakashs gaze firmly the first moment we have seen any sign of the gandhi of south africa
testingly we hope you intend to join us in the struggle for home rule mr
a pause charlie andrews touches gandhis arm excusing himself to the others
mohan i would like you to meet someone
gandhi bows to the others and is led off to an indian bishop in full clerical robes
behind him we see patel regaling a small group with some story of court or society
as gandhi leaves jinnah nehru and prakash watch him clinically
except for the servants gandhi is the only indian male not in european clothes
he told the press he would support the british in the war
acidly thats non violence for you
is he a fool
nehru grins slowly thoughtfully
im not certain
but i wouldnt be surprised
we get a shot of ba in a gathering of indian women
she stands listening seemingly tongue tied in the sophisticated patter
and we cut to charlie introducing gandhi to a man in obvious ill health but well dressed looking like the professor philosopher and elder statesman he is gokhale
i lied to you mohan when i told you i decided to come to south africa to meet you
professor gokhale sent me
gokhale is pleased gandhi amused
he bows very respectfully
were trying to make a nation gandhi and the british keep trying to break us up into religions and principalities and provinces
what you were writing in south africa thats what we need here
he has offered his hand during this and gandhi has helped him from the garden chair he has been seated on handing him the cane that is resting against it
a smile i have much to learn about india
and i have to begin my practice again one needs money to run a journal
gokhale has started to walk with him looking at him intently penetratingly
he turns to charlie go on charlie
this is indian talk we want none of you imperialists
it is brusque but affectionate we know he regards charlie as gandhi does
and charlie does too
a mock threat all right ill go and write my report to the viceroy
go and find a pretty hindu woman and convert her to christianity thats as much mischief as youre allowed
he still hasnt smiled but gandhi and charlie have
this is private beautiful and still
gandhi walks along slowly taking the pace of the ailing gokhale
forget your practice
india has many men with too much wealth it is their privilege to nourish the efforts of the few who can raise india from servitude and apathy
i will see to it you begin your journal
i have little to say
india is an alien country to me
he grins self deprecatingly but gokhale persists
well change that
go and find india
not what you see here but the real india
youll see what needs to be said
what we need to hear
he pauses and looks at gandhi and for the first time he smiles
when he speaks his voice is thick with feeling
when i saw you in that tunic i knew
i knew i could die in peace
a dying mans command make india proud of herself
his eyes are watery with emotion but he stares at gandhi rigidly
a breed of its own
gandhi sits by a window in the dimly lit coach
ba sleeps on the seat next to him another member of the party next to her
gandhis solemn eyes are studying the huddled humanity in the rocking coach
people are sleeping everywhere some half erect on the benches many on the floor among the bundles and trunks and bedrolls and baskets
some have children some are very old
one old man sleepless like gandhi stares back at him across the shadowed squalor of the coach somewhere unseen a crying baby is soothed by his mother
gandhi looks at the bench across from him
charlie andrews his tall frame cramped in a tiny space between the window looks at gandhi dozily a little smile of sufferance then he closes his eyes again leaning his
head against the rocking window frame
gandhi is carried along in a ceremonial chair borne on the shoulders of some trotting men
the chair is swathed in flowers and flowers are being showered on gandhi by the running children and the crowd lining the narrow street
ba and charlie and two others are following in a flower bedecked ox cart lost in the mass of people that are swirling around gandhi
on a building top a british officer watches emotionlessly as gandhi and the crowd pass below him
on this building and others we see some on his indian soldiers watching with their rifles beside them
as from a train
but the shots are varied some close of farmers and water buffalo and ragged children and women in colorful saris carrying pots on their heads and some distant of villages
as units one and another and another
gandhis face in the window he and ba standing looking out together neither speaking
gandhi writing in the cramped chaos of the third class coaches
gandhi sweeping part of the carriage making disgruntled passengers move as he tries to bring some cleanliness to their surroundings
a broad alluvial plain the river threading through it purple and gold in the rising sun
the camera races with the train along the rivers edge the reflected sun glimmering on the windows
the sun is high and the train is stopped by the river
people have come out of the coaches to cool their heads with the touch of water to stretch their legs
we see an english clergyman from the second class coaches dipping a toe cautiously into the water children of some british enlisted soldiers wading splashing faces alight with fun
and farther along the parasols of one or two of the english first class passengers a woman dousing her neck delicately with perfume
a british officer tunic unbuttoned smoking a long cigar as he walks along in a few inches of water his trousers rolled up his shoes off
across the river down from the third class coaches a small group of indian women is squatted by the rivers edge washing clothes
some carry infants on their backs
some small children stand near them
their ritual of washing goes on but they are all watching the passengers of the train
gandhi stands with ba and charlie among the third class passengers
ba cools her face with water
charlie his trousers rolled up plays a tentative splashing game with a skinny little indian boy
gandhi is holding a large white head cloth which he is soaking in the water but his eyes have been arrested by the sight of the women across the river
and now we see the women closely from his point of view the camera panning slowly along them
their bodies are skin and bone
the clothes they wear which looked normal from the distance are rags literally shredded rages one hung on another
the children are hollow eyed and gaunt staring listlessly at the train
one boy with a stump for an arm aimlessly pushes at the flies that buzz around him
gandhi stands erect lost now in the revelation of their poverty
his eyes hold on one woman at the river bank
though her frail face is almost skeletal it is beautiful but scarred by a severe rash down her cheek and neck
the cloth she is washing is a shredded piece of muslin
her eyes have met gandhis as he watches her
gandhi stares for a moment a long beat
then he slowly moves his arm out into the water and without taking his eyes from her releases the head cloth he has been rinsing
it floats along on the water down toward the woman
she looks from gandhi to it with sudden excitement a sense of incredulity
as the cloth nears her she rises and moves almost greedily out into the water to take it
her hands snatch at it quickly
then she stands looking at gandhi
the infant on her back shifts its huge hollow eyes reacting to the movement
gandhi smiles slowly tilting his head just slightly to her
and now that she has possession of the cloth her manner calms again
and she looks back at him and her lips almost part with a tiny smile of thanks
hold gandhi staring at her fighting the pain in his eyes
threading like a lighted necklace across the darkness of a vast plain
climbing green hills a totally different terrain and again we intercut this time the train climbing a boy and buffalo running a huge crude grinding wheel train climbing farmers in
terraced fields train climbing faster and faster
until suddenly with a hoot of the whistle and the screech of brakes it stops
gandhi is leaning out of a window in a third class coach
ahead of him other passengers are looking too some have jumped down
gandhi and charlie jump down too
as they come clear they can see that a military train of an engine and two cars has been derailed ahead of them
a small troop of cavalry are coming slowly along the line of gandhis train toward them
featuring the cavalry
they are british and their troop leader is viciously angry
clear the way
get out of the way
he is swinging his sword not lethally but threateningly at the indian passengers from the train
his british ncos are equally angry and deliberately ride close to the passengers forcing them back against the train
gandhi and charlie step back
and as the troop goes past we see from their point of view a group of indian bearers trotting in the middle of the horsemen carrying two litters covered each
hanging by straps from a long pole and each bearing a badly wounded british soldier one appears to be dead
the shadow of a train moves slowly along the ground a sense of tension and foreboding
we hear the engine chugging slowly
the camera lifts
gandhi and charlie stand at a window staring out grimly
other passengers are looking off too
ba is seated staring straight ahead her face taut deliberately not seeing what the others are seeing
their point of view on a hill across from the railroad track part of a prison wall is visible
in front of it a thick pole is straddled across two others
from this crude gallows two indian men hang by the neck
one is in turban and dhoti the other in a tunic
the sound of the train stopping
incense rising in shot
the camera pulls back and back
the incense is burning in a bowl sitting before gandhi on a make shift platform set in the little valley between the train line and the little hill where the
indian men have been hanged
a small crowd sits in a crescent before him ba and charlie are bent in prayer on the platform behind him
when the camera comes to rest the edge of the gallows and a portion of one of the hanged men is in the frame
we know we are looking from someones point of view near the prison wall
finally gandhi lifts his head
at first distant as from the hill i ask you to pray for those who died
closer for the english soldiers
a murmur who were doing what they thought was right
closer and for the brave terrorists whose patriotism led them to do what was wrong
the murmur of resistance from the crowd is louder at this
gandhi shakes his head at the dissent
it is not my law it is the law of creation
we reap what we sow
out there in the fields and in our hearts
violence sows hatred and the will to revenge
and in us
he looks up
the troop leader on horseback is on the hill beside the gallows
the first view of gandhi on the platform was his
some of his troops are lined up beside him
he stares down at gandhi coldly
patel lounges in the water on his back supported by a large air pillow
nehru sits at the side of the pool in a swimming suit his feet dangling in the water
jinnah sits under an umbrella in an elegant white suit being served tea by one of three or four servants around
patel spews a fountain of water
i agree with jinnah
now that the americans are in the war will end soon
the germans are worn out as it is
he rolls over facing nehru and our first act should be to convene a congress party convention and demand independence
nehru takes an iced drunk from a servant
and we must speak with one voice united
the others assent
nehru shakes his head wistfully
it reminds him ah we should invite gandhi
what the devil has happened to him anyway
hes discovering india
cynically which is a lot better than causing trouble where it matters
invite him let him say his piece about south africa and then let him slip into oblivion
a fireman heaps coal into an engines boiler
the train passes camera to the third class section which seems besieged by humanity
people cling to the outside of each door and many more are seated on the central wooden planks on the roofs of the two coaches
gandhi and charlie are riding on the outside of the coach hanging on through the door and both enjoying it immensely
ba inside the jammed coach finds it very unfunny
she has a grip on one of gandhis arms
quietly private please
youre being foolish
theres no room
and the air is lovely
she grimaces severely and tugs at him
no violence please
let me hang on with two hands or i will fall
featuring the roof
and indian squats right on the edge of the roof above charlie
he is looking down offering a hand
over the sound of the engine englishman sahib
charlie who has been grinning suddenly looks baffled not to say appalled
there is room
his hand still dangles in offering to the tall charlie
two other indians on the roof move to where they can grip the first indians other arm as counterforce to the weight of charlie
to charlie place the foot on the window
hesitatingly he grips the inside of the window higher and starts to swing one foot onto the window ledge
amused but disconcerted what are you doing
grimly going nearer to god
gandhi baffled a second sees the outstretched hand above them and in puckish complicity helps boost charlie up
as charlie reaches up his hand is grasped and he starts to scramble and be pulled up to the roof
featuring gandhi and ba
as charlies leg assisted by gandhi starts to leave its lodging on the window ledge ba suddenly turns sees it and grabs for it in alarm
his face flat on the roof of the train as his arm is still gripped by the indian but his leg is being pulled from behind
resume gandhi and ba
gandhi quickly moves to free bas hand from charlies leg and almost loses his own grip
he grabs the window again
youll kill him
ba is confused
with one hand he pries at her grip
in the chaos of instructions others in the coach are helping gandhi and ba senses she is doing something wrong but is still not sure what
she lets go
a desperate sigh of relief
charlie is pulled on up to the top of the coach
featuring charlie as he sits puffing and recovering from the fright
you see most comfortable
charlie nods grimly
featuring gandhi and ba
gandhi smiling goes on the tips of his toes to get a better view
ba grabs him desperately
please god no
he looks around at the rest of the passengers on the roof their bundles and baskets clutched beside them
their poverty is appalling but they are all smiling at him a sense of gaiety made in part by his englishmans participation in their experience
they must shout over the train
grinning are you christian sahib
nods yes yes im a christian
proudly i know a christian
charlie acknowledges it politely
she drinks blood
charlie stares at him in surprise
explaining obvious the blood of christ every sunday
he is nodding smiling expecting charlies understanding
and charlie gives it somewhat bleakly
suddenly alarmed charlie
the indians turn
resume charlie and the indians
its all right sahib
very safe bend bend
all the indians are crouching
charlie closes his eyes ruefully hes had better ideas than this and he gets as flat as he can
the train with passengers clinging to the sides and riding on the top steams into the tunnel its whistle sounding
a glimmer of light through steam the whistle echoing
pray to god sahib
now is when it is best to be hindu
in a flash of steamy light staring wide eyed at the indian
black and sudden silence
coming into focus is a lighted platform and as the scene becomes clearer we see figures on the platform and the banner which reads indian national congress and we hear
the emotional voice of jinnah at the microphone
gradually fading in we were asked for toleration
we were asked for patience
some gave it and some did not
well their war is over
and those of us who supported it and those of us who refused must forget our differences
the camera has been moving in now it jumps to jinnah in close shot and intercuts with the impact of his fervid delivery on the audience
and there can be no excuses from the british now
india wants home rule
india demands home rule
and the audience cheers him
newspaper cameramen crowded around the platform photograph him
patel comes forward from the back of the platform clapping
he is chairing the congress
jinnah bows taking his notes gesturing to the auditorium
a man made for the spotlight a man loving the spotlight
at last he moves back to his place on the platform
nehru clasps his hand in congratulation
others crowd around him
and fleetingly just in the edge of picture we see gandhi again the only one in an indian tunic sitting at the end of the second row on the platform
he is just watching the flood of enthusiasm for jinnah
featuring patel approaching the microphone stilling the house with upraised hands
and let no one question that mr
jinnah speaks not just for the muslims but for all india
and again the audience cheers and applauds his little coda
he raises his hands stilling them again
and now im going to introduce to you a man whose writings we are all becoming familiar with
a man who stood high in the esteem of our beloved professor gokhale
a man whose accomplishment in south africa will always be remembered
gandhi has already started to come toward the podium
he is greeted with mild applause but already the convention is performing like a convention now that the spell of jinnahs major speech has dissipated
as gandhi reaches the podium patel gestures him to it
politely your journal has made a great impact
gandhi nods to him and acknowledges the residue of applause
i am flattered by mr
patel his grin
i would be even more flattered if what he said were true
he means about the journal
patel has wandered back toward the others his mind already on them
but he has half heard gandhis comment and turns a smile a politicians flexibility loudly he is away from the mike but its true
i i read it
again gandhi grins and takes glasses from his sleeve
this is the first time we have seen them
he has one slip of paper with notes on it which he has put on the podium
he puts his glasses on and faces the convention
since i returned from south africa i have traveled over much of india
and i know i could travel many more years and still only see a small part of it
on the platform the whispered politics go on
on the floor of the convention some listen some talk of other things
and yet already i know what we say here means nothing to the masses of our country
nehru has turned having caught that last remark
he touches patel on the shoulder listen
here we make speeches for each other and those english liberal magazines that may grant us a few lines
and now they are beginning to pay attention on the floor of the hall too
but the people of india are untouched
their politics are confined to bread and salt
jinnah too is listening now aloofly challengingly
illiterate they may be but they are not blind
they see no reason to give their loyalty to rich and powerful men who simply want to take over the role of the british in the name of freedom
there is dissent on the floor and on the platform but it is muttered and english polite
gandhi goes on
this congress tells the world it represents india
my brothers india is seven hundred thousand villages not a few hundred lawyers in delhi and bombay
until we stand in the fields with the millions who toil each day under the hot sun we will not represent india nor will we ever be able to challenge
the british as one nation
he takes off his glasses and folds them and in silence starts back toward his place on the platform
a cameraman flashes a picture and someone begins to applaud it is taken up here and there tepidly
on the platform the leaders join in perfunctorily
we see one peasant face shukla which we will come to know watching from the crowd of outsiders who stand in the doorways
nehru who has been looking at gandhi with interest and some surprise turns to patel
have you read his magazine
no but i think im going to
an open touring car struggling along the bumpy trail
nehru drives four friends as young as he with him all dressed in the same expensive british manner
this cant be the way
nehru is looking a little harassed from the ragging he is taking and from the ride
the ashram is only half finished the ground unworked the buildings only partially completed and the whole looking like some primitive frontier outpost
they are finally brought to a halt by a goat that is tethered right across the path
a mocking quote yes im sure this is the direction india is taking
the others laugh nehru suffers
to think i almost got excited by mr
jinnah when all this was awaiting me
nehru has half risen in his seat to address charlie andrews who walking from one somnolent building to another has stopped dead at the sight of the car
he carries sheaves of page proofs
were looking for mr
ah youll find him under the tree by the river
he points off then glances at the car
youd better leave the car the ground is rather soft
he looks around the ashram a little dismally
drolly as he climbs out come on
im anxious to meet this new force
gandhi sits under a tree peeling potatoes
nehru and his friends are sprawled out around him
beside them the river in the background the business of the ashram goes on
i try to live like an indian as you see
it is stupid of course because in our country it is the british who decide how an indian lives what he may buy what he may sell
and from their luxury in the midst of our terrible poverty they instruct us on what is justice and what is sedition
he looks at them a teasing but mordant grin
so it is only natural that our best young minds assume an air of eastern dignity while greedily assimilating every western weakness as quickly as they can acquire it
his smile is sardonic but genuine theirs embarrassed and self conscious
defensively if we have home rule that will change
gandhi has finished the last potato
he glances at nehru then drops the potato in the bowl
he lifts the pail of peelings to nehru
would you please
nehru in his fine linen suit takes the pail awkwardly
his friends watch with amusement but they too rise to follow as they head for the kitchen
and why should the english grant us home rule
here we must take the peelings to the goats
he re directs nehru toward a trough where two or three goats are tethered but he keeps right on talking
we only make wild speeches or perform even wilder acts of terrorism
weve bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the british anywhere
surprised i thought you were against fighting
they have reached the trough
just spread it around they like the new peelings mixed with the rotting ones
nehru has carefully walked around something distasteful on the ground now he dumps the peelings along the trough and spreads them delicately
gandhi scoops some peelings from the trough to feed a goat that nudges him
where there is injustice ive always believed in fighting
he looks at nehru
the question is do you fight to change things or do you fight to punish
for myself i have found that we are all such sinners we should leave punishment to god
and if we really want to change things there are better ways of doing it than by derailing trains or slashing someone with a sword
he meets nehrus gaze and for a moment something deeper than argument passes between them
then something catches gandhis eye
he looks off
ba stands watching him waiting
the fire is ready
the goat is reaching for his bowl of potatoes
he pushes it away and starts for the kitchen
you see even here we live under tyranny
nehru grins captured by gandhis seriousness and his humor
he hasnt moved and neither have his friends
they watch gandhi as he carries his bowl of potatoes to ba
reflectively i told you
but look at him
i can see the british shaking now
gandhi plods on toward the kitchen carrying the bowl of potatoes
clothes are dipped in the brownish water
ba and an ashramite woman squat by the river washing clothes
it is long past the monsoons and they have had to come far out in the riverbed to the water
but they are laughing at their task
but its the ink that is the most diffic she stops because coming along the riverbed toward them is a man shukla who looks as though he has come a
long weary way
his face is gaunt his little bundle of belongings pathetic
as he nears them he pauses
i am looking for mr
shadowed the end of the day
gandhi sits cross legged watching solemnly as shukla reaches with his fingers into a bowl to eat
the fingers are thin half starved like the man himself
ive wanted to speak to you for a long time
he looks up at gandhi almost sheepishly
he does not eat yet but his hunger is evident
ba sits at one side in the shadows watching him as intently as gandhi
we cant sell them
we have no money
but the landlords take the same rent
his voice is choked and near to tears resonant with the unspoken agony his words mean for him and the others like him
he looks at gandhi nervously for a moment then puts the food to his mouth like a man who is starving and trying desperately not to show it
the solemn intensity of her gaze reflects her identification with the mans agony
she glances up at gandhi
the camera is low shooting along the track toward the light of an approaching train
from its distant glow we can see that people line the platform of the small station waiting but we cannot tell how thick the crowd may be
the station house
an open staff car pulls up through the press of the crowd
an english captain leaps out and pushes aggressively through the mass of bodies toward the platform
again the darkness of the ill lit station and the angle of the camera limit our vision
clear the way there
get out of the way
a detail of british troops already on the station moves in his wake just as aggressive toward the crowd as he is
the sergeant is on the low sloping roof of the station
the captain turns briskly to two of his detail
give me a leg up will you
the two men join hands and the captain is hoisted up with an assist from sergeant putnam
we hear the train stop in the background
on the roof
the captain stands erect
what the hell is it sergeant
he is now standing and his face has frozen
it needs no answer from putnam
he turns his head slowly his mouth agape at his point of view
the whole of the obscurely lit platform is covered thick with waiting crowds
they engulf the station house back and front and on the other side of the train more people are packed all along its length and beyond them along the narrow
street that stretches through the little collection of houses adjoining the station every rooftop is covered men women with babes in arms children
there is no excitement hardly any movement just a vast congregation of people waiting silently is the darkness and as the camera pans we see that the crowd extends indiscernible
even beyond the range of light
awed a little frightened what the hell is going on
i dont know sir
the agent says they got a telegram and it just said he is coming
and gave the time of the train
who the hell is he
i dont know sir
he has stepped down from the train
shukla guides him ba and charlie a step or two behind
gandhi moves through the silent crowd his hands in the pranam bowing a little to either side
as he advances the crowd parts it is almost eerily silent
as their clothes indicate the area is muslim so some salaam a touch of the hand to the forehead and a few tentatively make the pranam back to gandhi as
he moves through them
most of the faces are gaunt and lean
a destitute people
and suddenly there is a commotion and the sound of boots on the concrete platform and the english captain shoves his way through to confront gandhi down the little aisle
that was being made for him
the sergeant and part of the detail and behind the captain
the captain stares
then he looks around at the crowd suspiciously a touch of inner fear then back to gandhi
who the devil are you
my name is gandhi
there is a flicker of recognition but uncertain
the captain stiffens a steeling of the will
another glance at the crowd this time with an air of outraged authority
well whoever you are we dont want you here
i suggest you get back on that train before it leaves the station
calmly a glance at the crowd they seem to want me
now look here
ill put you under arrest if youd prefer
on what charge
it has the cold assurance of a lawyer and the captain is a little shaken by it
he glances at charlie who stands behind gandhi now and it makes him all the more uncertain
i dont want any trouble
he tries to make it severe but it is a comedown
i am an indian traveling in my own country
i see no reason for trouble
it is firm and there is an edge of assertiveness to it that the captain doesnt like but gandhis unrelenting stare unnerves him
he glances at charlie again
well thered better not be
again the empty severity of weakness
he looks around then turns and marches off briskly shoving his way through the crowd
out of my way there
come on move
gandhi smiles reflectively and the crowd suddenly begins to buzz
where all was silence before there is now the hum of excitement
already he has scored a victory and as he moves forward again making the pranam they return it with flushed greetings
gandhi gandhi bapu gandhiji
the early light of the sun illumines the dwelling
we feature a man in middle age but one who looks ill and drawn meha
he lies on a straw mat
for years the landlords have ordered us to grow indigo for dyeing the cloth
always they took part of the crop as rent
gandhi sits cross legged listening
it is the kind of listening that opens the heart
behind him a mass of villagers sits stoically outside the dwelling waiting while their case is heard
meha tries to speak unemotionally but under gandhis sympathetic gaze his despair keeps cracking through
but now the english factories make cloth for everyone
no one wants our indigo
and the landlords wont take their share
they say we must pay our rent in cash
near to breakdown he gestures around the empty house
what we could we sold
the police have taken the rest
there is no food we he cannot go on
he examines his hands a moment
the landlords are british
its a rhetorical question
gandhi looks around the crude dwelling almost nothing remains
we see two young men one seventeen perhaps the other older and a girl sixteen
and finally mehas wife sitting near ba the two women listening together but mehas wife looks like a woman who has given up her hair is dead and hardly combed
her sari dirty
meha looks at gandhi and shakes his head hopelessly
he stands slowly
what we can do
we will try to do
the words are said bleakly not to raise false hopes
he glances at mehas wife
water comes to her eyes and she lowers her head
ba puts her hands on her shoulders and clasps her to her and the woman breaks and sobs and sobs
gandhi rides on an open howdah on an elephant his mind locked in sober reflection
shukla shares the howdah with him but does not dare break gandhis black mood
is all champaran like this shukla
he looks across the field
the whole province
it registers with gandhi but inside
gandhi shakes himself from his absorption and looks back
ba and charlie are mounted on a similar howdah on another elephant both being led by peasant boys
charlie is pointing behind them
coming along the path is a tall indian policeman on a bicycle
he rides right past charlie and ba and comes alongside gandhi
his attitude is superficially polite but he is full of righteous authority
he knows are you mr
im sorry but you are under arrest
i am not sorry at all
it contains more anger than we have seen him display to anyone but ba
a ball is hit
the camera pulls back to reveal a lush verdant pitch white garbed players english a few ladies dressed in first world war fashion watching under parasols near the clubhouse and
in the shade of trees with a few officers and civil servants while indian servants discreetly serve cool drinks
the batsman has hit a four and we see him run down the pitch with his partner until the four is certain then to the wicket keeper who did you
say would be buying the drinks
the wicket keeper makes a rude facetious gesture but as the batsman turns to settle in his crease again oh no he has looked up
a car is pulling hurriedly in near the clubhouse an officer in it and people are streaming toward it
a major is standing on the back seat
an indian corporal drives
ive got no idea
all i know is theres a riot or something at motihari in champaran and the whole company is ordered out
its two days march
thats why the match is off
its mostly muslim territory and the old mans taking no chances
featuring the batsman and some of the players as they walk across the field toward the car
they know somethings up
disgusted god and its the best innings ive had since oxford
dryly indias full of grief old man
the batsman takes on him facetiously and we cut to a small building on a little anglicized square
it is surrounded by a milling angry throng of peasants
featuring the front entrance
the english captain who was at the station when gandhi arrived is on the top step looking harried and tense
a small detachment of indian troops lines the step below him
charlie andrews is pushing through the crowd toward the captain
as he approaches the indian sergeant holds up his hand
firmly i wish to see the prisoner please
the captain looks at his clerical collar his english face his determination
reluctantly all right sergeant
charlie moves through the indian soldiers and up toward the entrance
the captain stares out worriedly over the unruly crowd
a basement chamber dark thick walled and poorly lit
the camera has panned off a close shot of gandhi as he turns in his cell at the sound of a door opening and approaching footsteps
we have seen only his head and shoulders which are covered in a shawl
a police guard leads charlie across the rough unfinished floor
as he comes to gandhis cell we get a fleeting glimpse of gandhi sitting on a low pallet bed
gandhi as he recognizes his visitor
charlie reverse on charlie
he looks down at gandhi and shakes his head
a somber grin shades of south africa
head and shoulders
he returns the grin but anger and determination still dominate his mood
theyre only holding me until the magistrates hearing
then it will be prison
sympathetically did they take your clothes
and now we see gandhi in full shot for the first time
he is wearing only a white loincloth the shawl over his shoulders and sandals the costume he will wear for the rest of his life
these are my clothes now
charlie studies him a moment and being charlie he understands
affectionately you always had a puritanical streak mohan
he grins and it elicits a little grin from gandhi
in a tone of defensiveness if i want to be one with them i have to live like them
i think you do
but i thank god we all dont
and gandhi laughs
im sure your legs are quite as handsome as mine
ah but my puritanism runs the another way
im far too modest for such a display
and again gandhi laughs
charlie turns to the guard
couldnt i be let in with the prisoner
i am a clergyman
the police guard hesitates and then unlocks the cell
charlie enters and sits on a little wooden stool opposite gandhi his long legs awkwardly filling most of the space between them
gandhi has remained seated pensive
charlie studies him a moment
a bit puzzled theyre calling you bapu
i thought it meant father
wistfully it does
we must be getting old charlie
a little grin but his mood remains pensive and remote
what do you want me to do
gandhi looks up his anger his determination there but then broken by a hopeless sigh
i think charlie that you can help us most by taking that assignment youve been offered in fiji
charlie is stunned and obviously hurt
gandhi proceeds more gently
i have to be sure they have to be sure that what we do can be done by indians
and now charlie understands
gandhi smiles warmth and sadness
then he speaks with a determined purposefulness a friends trust
but you know the strategy
the world is full of people who will despise whats happening here
it is their strength we need
before you go you could start us in the right direction
he has taken some scratched notes from under the bedding and handed them to charlie
he sighs and rises slowly
i must leave from calcutta and soon
youll have to say goodbye to ba for me
gandhi rises glancing wryly at the prison walls
when i get the chance
and now he faces charlie this is the moment of farewell
well i he doesnt know what to say how to say it
gandhi meets his eyes a smile that shelters charlies vulnerability returns his love
there are no goodbyes for us charlie
wherever you are you will always be in my heart
the very english very steadfast charlie fights to contain his emotions
it is packed to overflowing restless
gandhi sits in the dock
one or two sergeants at arms are trying to keep order but it the uneven and menacing chanting of gandhi
gandhi coming from the mobs outside the courtroom that fills the atmosphere with threat
the magistrate english is surveying the courtroom he signals his clerk english to him
whispered conference i am going to clear the courtroom
politely im not sure wed be able to
and it is a first hearing its supposed to be public
and hes a lawyer
the magistrate frowns
worried angry i dont know where they found the nerve for all this
im sure i dont either but the troops wont be here until tomorrow
how the press get here before the military
we see the front row from his point of view
two or three indian journalists and one european
that english clergyman sent a number of telegrams yesterday afternoon
i understand one of them even went to the viceroy
the magistrate receives that news with some alarm
he indicates that the clerk take his place
the courtroom is silent but we can still hear the sound of the chanting outside
you have been ordered out of the province on the grounds of disturbing the peace
defiantly with respect i refuse to go
the magistrate stares
the journalists write
the clerk swallows
the magistrate looks around the courtroom and is only too aware of the mob outside
sternly do you want to go to jail
not giving him an inch as you wish
the clerk lowers his eyes to his pad
the magistrate searches the distant wall the top of his desk his twitching hands for an answer
finally as much sternness as he can muster all right
i will release you on bail of one hundred rupees until i reach a sentence
i refuse to pay one hundred rupees
again the magistrate stares
and so do the journalists
the magistrate wets his lips then i i will grant release without bail until i reach a decision
and now the court explodes
in the chaos of cheering and delight the magistrate rises looks around the room and heads for his chambers
the journalists are scribbling furiously
gandhi turns and starts out of the courtroom
we hear cries of gandhi
gandhi steps down from the courtroom to the balcony
a huge cheer comes up from the massed peasants below
as he smiles down at them he is turned by gandhiji
four young indians elegantly dressed in english clothes are following him having plunged through the crowd in the courtroom
a beat and the first young man addresses him over the chaos
his accent is as refined as his clothes gandhiji we are from bihar
we received a cable this morning from an old friend who was at cambridge with us
his name is nehru and i believe you know him
gandhi reacts with surprise and caution
he tells us you need help
and we have come to give it
again gandhi is surprised but even more cautious
behind him the crowd begins to chant gandhi gandhi
i want to document coldly rationally what is being done here
it may take months many many months
theyre eager impressed we have no pressing engagements
it sounds casually ironic but they look determined even angry
you will have to live with the peasants
i have nothing to pay you
they only smile
he is looking at them with a soupcon of skepticism but he is beginning to smell victory
his name echoes around him and is taken up even louder as the news spreads to the street
almost total silence
the room is long large and imposing hardwood floors overhead fans an aura of wealth and permanence
footsteps pace its acres of space
and sir george hodge comes into frame
he is rich middle aged tory and at the moment feeling impotent and harried
i dont know what this country is coming to
the governor sir edward gait the portrait of the king prominent behind him is feeling as cornered as sir george but for different reasons
his desk is arrayed with several tall stacks of folders all with exactly the same covers and on one corner of the desk some folded newspapers
we can just read gandhi in a headline
he taps one of the folders irritably with his hand
but good god man you yourself raised the rent simply to finance a hunting expedition
sir george looks at him half defensive half defiant
they are old friends the same school the same social class long together in india and their argument is an argument between friend who accept the same premises
but even so the governor feels the game has not quite been played fairly
and some of these others he gestures to the folders again beatings illegal seizures demanding services without pay even refusing them water
sir george is staring out of the window vexed bristling but defensive
nobody knows what it is to try to get these people to work
well youve make this half naked whatever he is into an international hero
he picks up one of the papers irritatedly the london daily chronicle
one lone man marching dusty roads armed only with honesty and a bamboo shaft doing battle with the british empire
he lowers the paper dismally then the ultimate bitterness at home children are writing essays about him
sir george looks at him and sighs heavily
sir edward stares back then drops the paper back on his desk
i couldnt take another two years of him to save my life
sir george turns and paces back toward him
for the first time we see sir edwards personal secretary a male civil servant sitting at a small desk and listening with highly developed unobtrusiveness
what do they want
it is the first sign of concession
sir edward lifts his eyes to his personal secretary
reading precisely from a document a rebate on rents paid
sir george huffs
they are to be free to grow crops of their own choice
a commission part indian to hear grievances
sir george looks from him to sir edward
wearily that would satisfy him
a nod then pointedly and his majestys government
it only needs your signature for the landlords
sir george looks at the document on the secretarys desk
the secretary turns it slowly so it is facing him
sir george looks at it like a snake
the secretary picks up a pen and offers it
a second then sir george takes the pen and signs angrily
it will be worth it to see the back of him
a flourish at the end of his signature then he stands
were too damn liberal
sir edward is at the liquor cabinet
but at least all this has made the government see some sense about what men like mr
gandhi should be allowed and what they should be denied
he turns offering sir george a whiskey in a finely cut glass of crystal
firmly things are going to change
jinnah moves from under the portico
his shining expensive car is coming in the drive and stops by him
he opens the back door but only the chauffeur is in the car
in annoyance where is mr
distastefully he said he preferred to walk sir
i followed him most of the way
hes just turned the corner
jinnah closes the door and looks across at the entrance in exasperation
the prophet give me patience
he came third class
its a disdainful comment and he drives the car off toward the garage
gandhi comes around the corner of the wall into the entrance
he is carrying a bedroll and a bamboo walking stick
herman kallenbach is with him dressed informally also carrying a bedroll
jinnah makes a sophisticated salaam
with effort my house is honored
gandhi grins dismissing the formality
he makes the pranam the honor is ours
may i introduce mr
hes an old friend anticipating jinnahs objection and his interest is in flowers
i presumed to tell him he could wander your gardens while we talked
the suave but slightly ironic host ill send my gardener
im sure youll have much to discuss
it is spacious english
at the door jinnah introduces gandhi to the room
gentlemen the hero of champaran
again gandhi grins at the extravagance
only the stubborn man of champaran
a polite little laugh jinnah introduces him
patel you know
maulana azad a fellow muslim
recently released from prison
gandhi makes the pranam studying him with interest after that comment
azad gives a gentle salaam
a bow we have seen him at the congress conference
and of course you know mr
he stands awaiting gandhis attention
all the others have been dressed in european clothes
the handsome europeanized nehru now wears an indian tunic much like the one that gandhi once wore
for a moment gandhi studies the costume then a broad smile
a play on jinnahs introduction i am beginning to know mr
to business gandhi has been admitted to the power circle he is not the power well ive called you here because ive had a chance to see the new legislation
its exactly what was rumored
arrest without warrant
automatic imprisonment for possession of materials considered seditious
he looks at gandhi
your writings are specifically listed
gandhi nods at the compliment but they are all angered by the severity of it
so much for helping them in the great war
fire there is only one answer to that
direct action on a scale they can never handle
again the temper of it produces a little silence
then i dont think so
he moves to a servant who stands holding a large tray with a silver service of tea
of them all nehrus manner is the most naturally patrician and jinnah watches him with a somewhat envious awareness of it
terrorism would only justify their repression
and what kinds of leaders would it throw up
are they likely to be the men we would want at the head of our country
his stand has produced a little shock of surprise
holding his tea he turns to gandhi with a little smile
ive been catching up on my reading
he means gandhis of course
jinnah looks at the two of them
gandhi has removed his sandals and is sitting cross legged on a fine upholstered chair
jinnahs eyes rake him with anger and distaste
coldly i too have read mr
gandhis writings but id rather be ruled by an indian terrorist than an english one
and i dont want to submit to that kind of law
to nehru diplomatically but with a trace of condescension i must say panditji it seems to me its gone beyond remedies like passive resistance
in the silence if i may i for one have never advocated passive anything
they all look at him with some surprise
as he speaks he rises and walks to the servant
i am with mr
we must never submit to such laws ever
and i think our resistance must be active and provocative
they all stare at him startled by his words and the fervor with which he speaks to them
i want to embarrass all those who wish to treat us as slaves
all of them
he holds their gaze then turns to the immobile servant and with a little smile takes the tray from him and places it on the table next to him
it makes them all aware that the servant standing there like an insensate ornament has been treated like a thing a slave
as it sinks in gandhi pours some tea then looks up at them with a pleading warmth first to jinnah
forgive my stupid illustration
but i want to change their minds not kill them for weaknesses we all possess
it impresses each one of them
but for all his impact they still take the measure of him with caution
and what resistance would you offer
the law is due to take effect from april sixth
i want to call on the nation to make that a day of prayer and fasting
prayer and fasting
they are not overwhelmed
you mean a general strike
his grin i mean a day of prayer and fasting
but of course no work could be done no buses no trains no factories no administration
the country would stop
patel is the first to recognize the implications
my god it would terrify them
a wry smile three hundred fifty million people at prayer
even the english newspapers would have to report that
and explain why
but could we get people to do it
he is half sold already champaran stirred the whole country
to gandhi they are calling you mahatma the great soul
fortunately such news comes very slowly where i live
continuing to the others i think if we all worked to publicize it
all of the congress
every avenue we know
the idea has caught hold
as the others talk of papers telegrams speeches jinnah looks over his cup at gandhi with an air of bitter resignation but he tries to make light of it
perhaps i should have stayed in the garden and talked about the flowers
a garden party in full imperial splendor
a military band plays discreetly in the background
princes maharajahs generals ranking british civil servants and their ladies taking tea on the manicured lawns among the exotic flowers
but over all there is a thread of anxiety we pick up one or two nervous phrases at the west gate there were no taxis at all
of course the army will always be loyal
and the camera picks out a civil servant stepping from a door of the palace carrying a sheaf of telegrams and cable forms
he searches the assembled guests then heads with almost indecorous haste toward his target
it is the viceroy lord chelmsford
with him talking quietly are his aide de camp the governor of the province and his adc and the commanding general of the army in india
lord chelmsfords adc is the first to react to the civil servants arrival and his impatient attendance
sir its mr
lord chelmsford turns expectantly
hesitant stunned nothing
nothing is working sir buses
personal incredulous theres not even any civilian staff here sir
everything has stopped
curt firm is it simply delhi and bombay
his firmness doesnt restore kinnochs normal aplomb
he holds the telegrams forward
no sir karachi calcutta madras bangalore
its its total
he glances at the general
the ultimate the army had to take over the telegraph or wed be cut off from the world
that takes the wind out of all of them
grimly lord chelmsford looks out across the palaces ordered lawns and gardens
i cant believe it
hes going to sell his own paper tomorrow in bombay
theyve called for a parade on victoria road
clenches his jaw and turns to the general arrest him
a prison door opens
gandhi in prison clothes is led along a small corridor to a room
the door is held open by a prison guard
nehru waits for gandhi
he rises when gandhi enters
the guard signals gandhi to a chair across a small wooden table from nehru
the guard closes the door but remains in the room
nehrus face is a map of concern but he manages a small smile of greeting
gandhi who also looks worn rises his eyebrows whimsically at the use of that name
he means bapu father
a real smile but the same affection it seems less formal than mahatma
gandhi sighs and their faces and minds go to more somber matters
since your arrest the riots have hardly stopped
not big but they keep breaking out
i run to stop them
and patel and kripalani they are never at rest
but some english civilians have been killed and the army is attacking crowds with clubs and sometimes worse
gandhi has listened to it all with a growing sense of despair
maybe im wrong
maybe were not ready yet
in south africa the numbers were small
the governments afraid and they dont know what to do
but theyre more afraid of terrorists than of you
the viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non violence
a sad smile ive never spoken for anything else
the golden dome of the temple fills the screen shimmering
the sound of a car and marching feet
the camera pulls back from the dome revealing the rooftops the trees and then suddenly center of frame the face of general dyer blunt cold isolated in a cocoon of
vengeful military righteousness
he is traveling slowly steadily in an armored car at the head of fifty armed sepoys gurkhas and baluchis immaculate precise awesome
behind them a staff car with dyers english adc and a british police officer
it is a relentless determined procession filling the dusty street with a sense of menace and foreboding
a large public garden enclosed by a thick old crumbling wall
a large crowd is gathered around a speaker on a platform at one side of the park
it is political but the crowd is mixed
we see muslims and hindus many of them sikhs old men little children women with babes in arms
some donkey carts a sense of fair time gaiety
we close in on the speaker a muslim
he clutches a copy we need not see the title of gandhis journal
england is so powerful its army and its navy all its modern weapons but when a great power like that strikes defenseless people it shows it brutality its own weakness
especially when those people do not strike back
he holds aloft the clenched journal
that is why the mahatma begs us to take the course of non violence
general dyer his armored car his sepoys moving toward the gate
dyer looks ahead calmly
his point of view
the gate of the bagh
a rickety double gate in the high crumbling wall
on each pillar poster notices for the meeting for congress for gandhi
in the distance the speaker and the assembled crowd
nearer a few vendors loiterers and children
at the sound of the armored car and marching feet a few turn in curiosity
the armored car grinds forward
it wont go through the gates one fender scraping against the gate post
dyer gives a quiet order the car backs away
dyer jumps down lightly a man in splendid condition
he walks through the gate and stands quietly in the at ease position hands clasping his swagger stick behind his back
looking off at the speaker medium shot
if we riot if we fight back we become the vandals and they become the law
if we bear their blows they are the vandals god and his law are on our
he glances up
long shot his point of view
the two platoons of sepoys rifles at the port trot smartly through the gate and fan out on either side of the motionless and dominant figure of dyer
resume the speaker
soldiering on we must have the courage to take their anger
medium close the sepoys and dyer
he issues his commands in a quiet and unemotional voice as though they were on maneuvers
port arms sergeant major
the sergeant major issues the command
the troops port arms
again the sergeant major barks the command the bolts slam back and forth the magazines clatter
featuring the platform and the front of the crowd
they have all turned now to watch frozen in incredulity and fascination
the sound of the sergeant majors orders and the sinister rattle of breeches and bolts drifting to them
almost to himself as he too is riveted our pain will be our victory
their point of view
the distant figures facing them
resume the crowd
numbly they begin to back away pressing against the speakers stand themselves
a man picks up a child
their point of view
the small distant figures of the sepoys again
a word of command
one platoon kneels and takes aim
the second platoon standing behind the first takes aim
his adc approaches
the british police officer stands off to one side
do we issue a warning sir
stiffly theyve had their warning no meetings
it is final
resume the crowd
a ripple of panic now everyone pressing back but still they cannot credit what they see
only one or two have the presence of mind to push clear and seek shelter
it is too late
close shot dyer still calm
sergeant major take aim
long shot over the sepoys and their sights the wavering crowd distant
flash shot along the line of sepoys the rifles jerk and bang
the crowd running screaming
a dreadful press of panic stricken people flying toward the walls
and again the crash of rifles
others run off screen in an aimless irresistible wave
dyer is walking behind his men telling them with a view to maximum accuracy what he has told them on the firing range it makes him a little irritable to
have to repeat it
take your time
take your time
he looks off at the crowd
his eyes narrow
a group of men are hurling themselves at a breach in the top of the wall hanging there scrabbling for a purchase some disappearing a few heroic individuals astride the
wall reaching down to assist their women and children in the swirling crowd below
the corporal looks
he directs the attention of his neighbors in the firing line toward the new target they shift their aim
a man reaching for a child who is also propelled upward by its mother from below is hit falls so that he and the child crash into the crowd below
sepoys firing ad lib
dyer watching the effect careful and conscientious
swift tracking a man running through the staggering crowd over the litter of bodies his mouth open his eyes wild
he arrives at a well throws down the rope and slides down it
others seize the idea and in panic throw themselves into the well dropping out of sight
meticulously he taps a corporal on the shoulder with his swagger stick and indicates the well
the corporal signals his line of men
at the well
the gathering crowd men women and laced with rifle fire
from behind the sepoys we see the whole bagh littered with dead and dying a thick ruck around the well the walls hanging with wounded and dying the firing continuing
loud loud louder
the camera is close as it crosses a table with legal documents
gradually we hear a muffled cough whispers shuffled papers and it at last comes to a large close shot of general dyer
a commission of inquiry sits in the large armory hall of the old fort
dyer faces a panel of commissioners lord hunter presiding mr
justice rankin general barrow a british civil servant and an indian barrister
the commission functions like a public parliamentary committee little ceremony no judicial robes a small group of public and press who sit on wooden chairs behind a barrier that isolates
the commissions business
much of that public is english fellow officers and civilians
a government advocate english turns to face dyer
general dyer is it correct that you ordered your troops to fire at the thickest part of the crowd
dyer glances woodenly at the panel a man in some shock at the consequences of what he assumed was an act worthy of praise
righteously that is so
the advocate looks at him with a degree of disbelief more at his attitude than his statement
one thousand five hundred and sixteen casualties with one thousand six hundred and fifty bullets
a slight reaction from the public section
dyers jaw tightens
my intention was to inflict a lesson that would have an impact throughout all india
he stares at the panel like a reasonable man making a reasonable point
the evasiveness the only half buried embarrassment of their response only deepens his own withdrawal into himself
general had you been able to take in the armored car would you have opened fire with the machine gun
dyer thinks about it
then unashamedly i think probably yes
a muted reaction from the public section
the indian barrister stares at him a moment then simply lowers his eyes to his notes
general did you realize there were children and women in the crowd
a beat i did
for the first time there is the hint of uncertainty in his manner
but that was irrelevant to the point you were making
that is correct
there is just a tremor of distaste quickly suppressed among the panel
not so quickly in the public section
could i ask you what provision you made for the wounded
dyer looks at him quickly
the question is unexpected even a little clever
the officers listening clearly resent it
a moment then firmly i was ready to help any who applied
and that answer stops the advocate
he smiles dryly
how does a child shot with a enfield apply for help
dyer faces him stonily a seed of panic taking root deep in his gut
quiet the same silence as at the court of inquiry
the camera is panning slowly along a section of the wall
we are close and see the bullet holes the patches of splashed blood the scratches where fingers have dug at the surface of the wall to claw a path to
and finally the camera comes to a close shot of gandhi matching that of dyer whom we have just left
he is surveying the wall in the now empty park numbly desolately
nehru stands a few feet away from him his mood the same the same benumbed grief and incredulity
resume the wall gandhis point of view
the camera continues its pan bits of human hair matted in the dried blood and the bullet ripped foliage the well trampled ground around it little pieces of clothing
flies buzz around the debris
abstractedly gandhi touches the bucket rope that lies across the surround
nehru has moved to the other side of the well
gandhi lifts his eyes to him
the imposing capitol building of the british raj in india
we establish then cut into featuring the viceroy lord chelmsford
you must understand gentlemen that his majestys government and the british people repudiate both the massacre and the philosophy that prompted it
chelmsford is pacing along one side of a large conference table
just in front of this is the british side two generals a full general and a brigadier a naval officer two senior civil servants a senior police officer
across from them is the indian side gandhi nehru patel jinnah azad
this time gandhi is in the middle and speaks with the full authority of a leader
the indian side acknowledges chelmsfords disclaimer coolly but accepting it
that lifts chelmsfords hopes a little
what i would like to do is to come to some compromise over the new civil legis if you will excuse me your excellency it is our view that matters
have gone beyond legislation
it is spoken with the cold determination of a man still angry
it stops chelmsford in mid pace
we think it is time you recognized that you are masters in someone elses home
it chills stiffens gandhi proceeds only an iota softer despite the best intentions of the best of you you must in the nature of things humiliate us to control us
general dyer is but an extreme example of the principle
it is time you left
the british are stunned almost to speechlessness the audacity the impossibility of it and from gandhi of all people
the senior civil servant kinnoch is the first to recover
with respect mr
gandhi without british administration this country would be reduced to chaos
patient ironic mr
kinnoch i beg you to accept that there is no people on earth who would not prefer their own bad government to the good government of an alien power
indignantly choked my dear sir india is british
were hardly an alien power
gandhi and the others just look at him
chelmsford is realist enough to recognize that a faux pas has been made and he strives to get the meeting back on the course he intends
even if his majesty could waive all other considerations he has a duty to the millions of his muslim subjects who are a minority in this realm
and experience has taught that his troops and his administration are essential in order to keep the peace
he has deliberately if delicately caught the eye of both jinnah and maulana azad during this
gandhi knows the trouble this can cause and he answers more for those on his side than the viceroys
all nations contain religious minorities
like other countries ours will have its problems
flat irrevocable but they will be ours not yours
its finality is such that for a moment there is no response at all but then the general smiles
and how do you propose to make them yours
you dont think were just going to walk out of india
his smile flitters cynically on the mouths of the others on his side
in the end you will walk out
because one hundred thousand englishmen simply cannot control three hundred fifty million indians if the indians refuse to co operate
and that is what we intend to achieve peaceful non violent non co operation
he looks at them all then up at lord chelmsford behind them
until you yourself see the wisdom of leaving
close shot a crystal decanter
the top is lifted whiskey pours
the camera pulls back
we are still in the council room but time has passed
the indian delegation has gone and the british are relaxing as a servant pours
mocking his exchange with gandhi you dont just expect us to walk out
and they all laugh
extraordinary little man
nonviolent non co operation for a moment i almost thought they were actually going to do something
there are some smiles but not all of them are quite so amused
thoughtfully yes but it would be wise to be very cautious for a time
the anti terrorist act will remain on the statutes but on no account is gandhi to be arrested
whatever mischief he causes i have no intention of making a martyr of him
it is an instruction they all find correct
a roar of approval from a huge crowd
we are featuring two british soldiers their faces partially lit by a flickering torch light that reveals their tense wariness
and we can see its cause
a huge crowd is gathered around a platform torches sprinkled through it and their mood is confident belligerent
as their defiant roar carries through the night air we see that gandhi sits cross legged on the platform
nehru is with him
patel now for the first time in an indian tunic and azad also in an indian tunic
desai gandhis new male secretary is with them
but it is ba who is speaking at the microphone who has brought the shout of defiance from the crowd
simple direct but now something worse is happening
when gandhiji and i were growing up women wove their own cloth
but now there are millions who have no work because those who can buy all they need from england
i say with gandhiji there is no beauty in the finest cloth if it makes hunger and unhappiness
it is the end of her speech and she makes the pranam and turns away
there is applause and noise but ba does not acknowledge it she simply sits cross legged behind gandhi who is talking with patel and nehru
at last he rises and the noise and applause increase to something like chaos
in close shot we see other british soldiers watching on the perimeter of the crowd and they are now made even more wary by the enthusiasm of this greeting
gandhi fiddles with his glasses preoccupied finally he looks out over the crowd and holds up a hand almost lazily and gradually but quite definitely the crowd stills
my message tonight is the message i have given to your brothers everywhere
to gain independence we must prove worthy of it
we intercut with the crowd listening raptly
gandhi holds up one finger
there must be hindu muslim unity always
a second finger
secondly no indian must be treated as the english treat us so we must remove untouchability from our lives and from our hearts
neither of these goals is easy and the audience reaction shows it
now gandhi raises a third finger
third we must defy the british
and the crowd breaks into stamping and applause
gandhi lets it run for a time then stills it with the one small gesture as before
not with violence that will inflame their will but with firmness that will open their eyes
this has sobered the audience somewhat
now he looks out across them as though seeking something
then english factories make the cloth that makes our poverty
all those who wish to make the english see bring me the cloth from manchester and leeds that you wear tonight and we will light a fire that will be
seen in delhi and london
there is an excited stir he silences it
and if like me you are left with only one piece of homespun wear it with dignity
close shot the ground
as suitcoats shirts vests trousers are flung into a pile
featuring the two british soldiers later on the edge of the crowd staring off their faces now brightly lit by darting flames
their point of view
a huge triangular pile burns before the platform an excited half naked crowd swirling in the shadows around it
resume the two british soldiers
they look at each other with a kind of fear a rampant crowd can excite in those who must hold it
the small train station near the ashram
kallenbach stands by a new early s ford touring car watching as a train pulls into the station
as people start to jump off the train he moves forward
featuring patel getting out of a compartment marked second class
he lugs a bedroll and a bag
despite the indian tunic he now wears he cannot help but look and act like the incisive patrician lawyer he is under the skin
as he moves through the crowded platform
excuse me just let me get out of your way please
someone reaches for his bedroll and bag
no thank you ill manage
he looks up it is kallenbach who is the insistent helper
joyous its been a long time ah herman
of the bags no no dont destroy my good intentions
im feeling guilty about traveling second class
kallenbach is smiling too
he reaches for the bags again
i do it as a friend and admirer not a servant
ah in that case
and grandly he relinquishes the bags and looks back
maulana is made of sterner stuff
our trains met in bombay but hes back there in that lot somewhere
their point of view
in the chaos of the third class we see maulana azad coming out of a section of the coach
he is carrying a baby wrapped in rags
the childs mother with two little ones hanging on her has followed him out
there he is out gandhi ing gandhi
azad hands the woman the baby and she obviously thanks him
he makes a little salaam to her and moves through the confusion of the platform toward the camera
resume patel and kallenbach
shaking his head at it all when i think what our beloved mahatma asks i dont know how he ever got such a hold over us
is he back
now that things are moving hes going to write and only take part when its necessary
azad approaches them
to patel it was a hindu child and it tried to wet on me
he and kallenbach clasp with their free hands both grinning
a muslim beef eater im only surprised he missed
he was a she
ah that explains it
well do i carry your luggage as penance or theres another passenger a miss slade
he turns automatically as patel and azad do toward the first class section
shes the daughter of an english admiral
patel and azad look back at him in quick surprise
shes been corresponding with him for a year
and the camera pans with their glances at they look back with real interest toward the first class coach
porters are unloading the baggage of two or three passengers here and helping some others english and indian to board
in the foreground we see a tall indian woman in a red sari
farther along there is a large stack of luggage being added to by a porter
an english woman is hovering about it
she is well dressed but rather dreary and unprepossessing and the camera zooms in toward her
and what does the daughter of an english admiral propose to do in an ashram sink us
quietly his manner from the looks of the luggage yes
like most witty men he loves wit in others
she wants to make her home with us and gandhiji has agreed
they turn back to the train and just as they do the tall indian woman in the red sari tips a porter taking one small bag from him and turns
mirabehn madeleine slade is tall quite pretty and extremely english despite the sari
the minute she turns she stops on seeing the now startled kallenbach
youd be mr
kallenbach recovers sufficiently to and you would be miss slade
proudly i prefer the name gandhiji has given me mirabehn
the word means daughter
patel and azad stare at each other in something like bafflement
an ox labors along in harness
we follow him for a moment then move along the traces of the harness to the ford touring car that it is pulling
in the car kallenbach and mirabehn sit in the front seat patel and azad in the back
of the car it was a gift and it only worked a few weeks but when gandhi came home he struck on this idea
he calls it his ox ford
comfortable and yet more our pace
he does what little steering is necessary and mirabehn smiles at it all finding everything delightful
she peers ahead in the direction of the distant ashram
nehru be there too
glibly the irresponsible young nehru is in prison again
though there is a rumor that under pressure from your country they will let him out again
mirabehn has turned to look at him
she has the same sophomoric eagerness and intensity as the young gandhi
you cant know how closely we follow your struggle to patel personally how many in england admired what you did in bardoli
it must have taken enormous courage
well in this country one must decide if one is more afraid of the government or gandhi
of azad kallenbach and himself for us its gandhi
mirabehn is enthralled by the wit the modesty that underlines the words
she faces kallenbach
a note of wonder and youre german
and do you feel indian
she thinks she does and that he would want to
it surprises but it doesnt deflate
but youve been with him so long why
kallenbach whose size and stillness carry the aura of some great piece of primitive sculpture solid true disturbingly profound searches inside himself for the answer
id come to believe i would never meet a truly honest man
and then i met one
it is so profoundly simple and deeply felt that it obviously touches the deeply emotional mirabehn
ba has a spinning wheel on the small porch and gandhi is sitting next to her with another
he is trying to imitate her action which is fast and dexterous and he gets in a terrible jumble
ba watches laughing
she leans across and tries to extricate his fingers
god gave you ten thumbs
and ba laughs again and gandhi smiles tapping her with playful reproval on the top of her bent head
there are footsteps and gandhi looks up
patel stands in the doorway
gandhis face changes to something like elation
it means leader and it is the name the peasants have given patel
gandhi uses it with an intonation of novelty and respect
he stands and crosses to patel clutching him emotionally and it brings a bit of emotion from the sophisticated patel
gandhi holds him back to look at him
what youve done is a miracle
you have made all india proud
patel gets hold of himself and affects his usual glib cynicism
it must have been the only non violent campaign ever led by a man who wanted to kill everybody every day
laughs not true
he means himself
the secret is mastering the urge
he smiles again then his arm still around patels shoulder he turns to greet the others
azad looks at him then facetiously as though to put down patel
he came second class
gandhi laughs again squeezing patels shoulder
well we cant expect miracles all the time
then to azad more soberly your news i understand is not so good
azad shakes his head
gandhi reaches forward and touches his hand and he sees mirabehn on the porch
for a moment their eyes meet and then mirabehn moves forward quickly and takes his hand kissing it tears running down her cheek
gandhi touches the top of her head
come come you will be my daughter
the camera is on a row of sandals by the door patels azads desais gandhis
it pans to the room
gandhi sitting facing patel and azad desai in the background making notes of the discussion
gandhi is carding fiber to thread as they talk
mirabehn seated like the others is almost in the circle sitting near ba and listening like her
bas spinning never stops
but then some rioting broke out between hindus and muslims violent terrible
gandhi looks up at azad azad shakes his head solemnly whether it was provoked
he shrugs a hint of suspicion but it gave them an excuse to impose martial law throughout bengal
he looks at gandhi shaking his head grimly
some of the things the military have done
but he does not go on
it has a terrible sobriety
is the campaign weakening
azad shakes his head
the marches and protests are bigger if anything but with the censorship here a nod toward mirabehn they know more in england than we do and it saps the courage
to think you may be suffering alone
gandhi reaches out and touches his hand
they are not alone
and martial law only shows how desperate the british are
he holds azads eyes giving strength
then he turns to mirabehn made more aware of her by azads reference
for a moment he looks at her sari
is that homespun
or cotton from leeds
the tone suggests he thinks it is homespun
mirabehn nods a little choked that his attention is turned to her
i i sent for it from here
i dyed it myself
gandhi smiles approvingly
then a shadow what do the workers in england make of what were doing
it must have produced hardship
but youd be surprised
they understand they really do
its not the workers you have to worry about
a glance toward ba
ba will have to teach you to spin too
i would rather march
let the others march for a time
mirabehn nods and looks resignedly at ba
ba is spinning
first lesson to march wear shoes to spin do not
mirabehn looks down at the shoes on her feet and then at the others and their bare feet and she looks up in grinning self conscious embarrassment
ba smiles at her affectionately
ill teach you all our foolishness and you must teach me yours
mirabehn looks at her accepting the warmth behind the teasing
it is the beginning of an enduring friendship
a small town
featuring the faces of six indian police constables as a torch light parade passes them
there are enough of them in their group to be watching the marchers with a challenging disdain
the marchers are men in loin clothes and tunics they brandish torn and ripped english cloth and shout in unison
long live gandhi
long live gandhi
we have cut to the parade and it is the tail end going around a corner ahead
some of the marchers wave their cloth tauntingly at the police
one policeman suddenly steps out and grabs at a piece of cloth waved at him
he pulls it viciously from the marcher
ill stuff your damn mouth with it
he chases the marcher and boots him with his foot
another marcher runs at the policeman swinging at him with his piece of cloth
leave him alone he wasnt harming you
another angle sudden
he is whacked across the face with a billy club and falls clutching his face and spouting blood from his nose
the police are now all attacking swinging clubs and kicking at the tail enders of the march
and the tail enders begin to scream help
as they try to scramble away from the attack
out of shot we can still hear the disappearing chant home rule
long live gandhi
the parade is on this street
a tail ender blood streaming down his face runs around the corner
lose shot the tail ender
as he stops screaming help
some of the marchers turn at the shout
a few of the tail enders watching some running clear of the police some being beaten
two police have a man on the ground
one policeman looks up
hey their point of view
the corner where the parade has disappeared
it is now packed with more marchers more flooding in from behind
we see the whole street the marchers massed near the corner spread out staring at the police who are now frozen in their mayhem staring off at the marchers
for a second utter silence
and then the police begin to back away from their victims
the marchers start to move forward
the police draw their guns and the marchers suddenly run at them a guttural roar as though they were one single wild beast
featuring the police
they start to run some turning to fire at the pursuing crowd then running on
a small building for this small town
a policeman on duty holds the door and the fleeing police first one then two more then the last three run into the building
the crowd surges around it smashing windows hurling stones
english cloth shirts pushed together and ignited
second close shot
trousers already aflame being hurled through a broken window
all around the noise of the angry surging crowd stones raining on the building
shouts out out
a corner of the building engulfed in flames
the camera pulls back and we see the whole building swept with fire
the heat of it keeps the crowd back but they are still shouting out out
out and a sudden cheer
at the door of the flaming building
one policeman appears his face blackened with soot his hands up over his head
another appears in the smoke behind him and they start to come out not only the original six but the five or six others who were in the building rushing
suddenly from the heat of the fire
close shot the crowd
we are close on the body of the first policeman as he runs into the crowd and on the instant we see a sword slash at his arm
the crowd massed around the fallen figure a flash of the sword going up over the heads a breathless pause and it comes down again
the flames of the crumbled building
the crowd has gone and we only hear the roar of the flames
the camera pans across the flames and we see a skull charred flesh still clinging to it the eyes black holes the teeth bare as it burns in the fire
close shot gandhi
his face drawn stunned as he stares emptily at the floor
he is sitting on the carpet in the center of the room
a moment of silence and then we begin to hear the tick of a clock the sounds of others moving in the room and finally thats one bit of news
they havent censored
patel leans with one arm on a table his mood as devastated as gandhis he is looking at an indian paper on the table by his hand
a moment then oh its all over the world
ironically indias non violence
he has been standing looking out of a window
he turns and tosses a newspaper on a desk
it is a new york times and we just glimpse the picture of the severed head lying in the smoldering ashes
and now we see nehru and azad in the background too
jinnah as usual in a finely cut european suit the others are dressed in tunics of homespun as they will be to the end
bleakly what can we do
sepulchrally we must end the campaign
they turn to him a sense of surprise but they dont really believe he means the statement
after what they did at the massacre its only an eye for an eye
he hasnt moved the same tone an eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind
now he looks up at them
we must stop
a baffled smile gandhiji do you know the sacrifices people have made
he looks at him
gandhi doesnt move
patel looks up hopelessly at jinnah
azad keeps his eyes fixed on gandhi sensing fearing what is going to happen
we would never get the same commitment again ever
he looks at gandhi with a mounting sense of annoyance
gandhi is listening but still withdrawn into himself
if we obtain our freedom by murder and bloodshed i want no part of it
pleading it was one incident
quietly tell that to the families of the policemen who died
jinnah turns away in anger
nehru feels helpless but he continues to try
bapu the whole nation is marching
they wouldnt stop even if we asked them to
gandhi stares into nothing mulling that
finally i will ask
and i will fast as penance for my part in arousing such emotions and i will not stop until they stop
nehru stares at him surprised
azad is not
you can be sure the british wont censor that
theyll put it on every street corner
gandhi does not react
and nehru ignores the thought too because like azad his mind is already on the real danger
but but gandhiji people are aroused
they wont stop
gandhi looks up at him a resigned fatalism
if i die perhaps they will
mirabehn walks across the grounds toward gandhis bungalow
she carries a small tray with a pitcher and a glass
we see a few people working in the background and a mass of people camped near the entrance some sprawled some sitting some standing all waiting
the steps of gandhis bungalow
a doctor in a white tunic sits on the porch reading
on a small table beside him we a stethoscope and the equipment to measure blood pressure
he looks up at mirabehn as she mounts the steps and nods
mirabehn reaches the doorway and is suddenly brought up
in the shadows ba sits by gandhis mat bed
she is holding him as he heaves in a spasm of dry retching his face to the wall
when he is finished he lies almost limp in her arms and she gently lowers him to the mat
she strokes his head
mirabehn stiffens herself
she is not yet devotee and nurse
she removes her sandals and walks across the room
ba looks up at her
she glances at the jug and glass then nods
she turns to gandhi
softly i must get ready for evening prayers
mirabehn is here
she strokes his sweating head again touches his shoulder and gets up
for a moment the two women hold each others gaze then ba smiles weakly and leans her head into the taller mirabehns shoulder
with her free hand mirabehn touches bas head
then ba straightens and leaves without looking back
mirabehn bends and sits by gandhis side
ive brought your drinking water
may i turn you
gandhi struggles to turn and mirabehn helps him
when he turns we see that his face is wet with sweat from the dry heaving and his hands and arms are quivering and he cannot stop them
she looks at him nervously then pours a glass from the pitcher
there is a little lemon juice in it
that is all
she turns back and propping up his head helps him to sip
herman has gone to meet pandit nehru there was a telegram
almost everywhere it has stopped
gandhi swallows with difficulty
he pauses letting his head fall back and she lowers it down to the mat again
he tries to smile
when it is everywhere then my prayers will be answered
mirabehn looks daunted by his intractability
do you find me stubborn
her own honesty i dont know
i know you are right
i dont know that this is right
gandhi signals her down to him
she bends so she is looking at the floor and he is speaking almost into her ear
hoarse strained when i despair i remember that all through history the way of truth and love has always won
we intercut their faces very close as he speaks
there have been tyrants and murderers and for a time they can seem invincible
but in the end they always fall
think of it always
when you are in doubt that that is gods way the way the world is meant to be
think of that
during the very last of it mirabehn has turned her face to him touched with emotion
the paternal smile and then try to do it his way
a tear runs down mirabehns face
she touches his shoulder
gandhi just leans his head back in exhaustion
and now could i have another feast of lemon juice
mirabehn straightens up smiling wiping the tear from her cheek with mock discipline
she starts to pour water from the pitcher into the glass again then she turns suddenly her attention caught
her point of view
nehru stands in it
kallenbach and desai are a step or two behind him
panditji come in
she stands moving back from gandhi
nehru crosses and kneels in mirabehns place
gandhi looks up at him and his eyes light
he moves his shaking hand out and nehru clasps it
a moment of personal feeling between them then jinnah patel all of congress has called for the end of non co operation
theres not been one demonstration
all over india people are praying that you will end the fast
theyre walking in the streets offering garlands to the police and to british soldiers
it is a victory
gandhis face cracks into a tearful grin
croaked perhaps perhaps i have overdone it
and nehru chokes with emotion and laughter at the same time
he buries his head on gandhis hand clutching it to him
a little boy is pulling a goat by a tether
he turns with a bright smile
good morning bapu
gandhi is walking holding bas shoulder for support with one hand and mirabehns with the other
it is some days later
of the goat dont let her go
if she bumps me i am done for
the boy grins at gandhis feigned alarm
i milk her every day shes not the sound of a motor disturbs them
his point of view
coming into the entrance along the bumpy path are two police cars early s morris
they have to stop because they are impeded by gandhis ox ford
four indian policeman hop quickly out of the second car
a british police superintendent and his british deputy get more decorously out of the first
gandhi has turned with his two props ba and mirabehn
the police are approaching him
kallenbach is running from the fields
nehru is hurrying from another building carrying sheaves of page proofs
other ashramites converge from the fields and buildings
the british police superintendent who is scottish stops before gandhi
a beat sedition
it is too absurd you cant be serious
this man has just stopped a revolution
uncomfortably he knows thats as may be
i only know what i am charged to perform
nehru stares at him and the policemen with growing incredulity
i dont believe it even the british cant be that stupid
panditji please help me
it stops nehru
he looks at gandhi and sighs in unmastered frustration but he moves to gandhis side
gandhi turns to mirabehn
you must help herman and ba
he releases her and says more loudly to the others i have been on many trips it is just another trip
he smiles at them then slips his free hand on nehrus shoulder and he turns to the superintendent
i am at your command
featuring gandhi ba and nehru as they walk to the car behind the somewhat surprised superintendent
to nehru if there is one protest one riot a disgrace of any kind i will fast again
he looks at nehru firmly
nehru knows him well enough now not to argue even at this though his face shows the struggle
and now he smiles gandhi to nehru special i know india is not ready for my kind of independence
if i am sent to jail perhaps that is the best protest our country can make at this time
and if it helps india i have never refused to take his majestys hospitality
he laughs and nehru struggles to join in the joke
a quiet hum in a packed courtroom
armed sepoys line the wall
featuring judge broomfield and the clerk
the judge is flipping through documents on the case a troubled frown on his face
at last he shuts the folder and nods to the clerk
the clerk turns and says in a moderately loud voice call the prisoner to the bar
the sergeant at arms turns and moves to the door at the side of the bench
the courtroom immediately falls silent
the sergeant at arms opens the door a moment and gandhi enters slowly
he has recovered a bit more but he still moves slowly
featuring judge broomfield
as gandhi enters he lowers his glasses places them on his desk and rises facing gandhi
featuring two english court reporters
one nudges the other in astonishment signaling off toward the judge
their point of view
the clerk confused as well as astonished see the judge standing facing gandhi in respect and dutifully he too stands
resume the reporters
a disbelieving exchange of glances the sound of others standing around them
they glance back
full shot the courtroom
the whole court rises the astounded reporters the last of all
he takes the prisoners stand
he looks around a little surprised a little affected by the demonstration
he looks up at the judge
for a minute their eyes meet the judge makes a little bow to gandhi
and the judge sits down
featuring the reporters shrugging incredulously to each other as they sit once more
the advocate general is speaking from a folded journal
non co operation has one aim the overthrow of the government
sedition must become our creed
we must give no quarter nor can we expect any
he looks up at gandhi
gandhi in your journal young india dated twenty second march of this year
do you deny writing it
not at all
to the judge and i will save the courts time mlord by stating under oath that to this day i believe non co operation with evil is a duty
and that british rule of india is evil
there is a little shock of reaction around the courtroom
the advocate general smiles with a brittle disdain then he turns to the judge
the prosecution rests mlord
the judge nods
he turns glancing at the empty table for defense counsel and then to gandhi
i take it you will conduct your own defense mr
i have no defense my lord
i am guilty as charged
then testingly and if you truly believe in the system of law you administer in my country you must inflict on me the severest penalty possible
it is almost a cruel challenge to the obviously humane broomfield
the reporters scribble watching the judge even as they write because the mere doubt in the judges face reflects on the whole position of the british to india
featuring judge broomfield
he lowers his glasses soberly staring at them for a moment
it is impossible for me to ignore that you are in a different category from any person i have ever tried or am likely to try
he looks up at gandhi and his own respect for him is almost poignantly manifest
a long beat it is nevertheless my duty to sentence you to six years imprisonment
a stunned intake of breath from the whole courtroom then in absolute silence the clerk scribbles the sentence in his notebook
the judge lowers his eyes
a personal statement not a real hope if however his majestys government could at some later date see fit to reduce that term no one would be better pleased than
he folds and refolds his glasses and then without looking at anyone he rises
the court rises and he walks stiffly to his chambers
he stands staring at broomfield and now it is his face that shows the respect
from far above the hills we see a car traveling along the road
its style tells us some years have passed
featuring walker close
the reporter from the new york times whom we first saw as a younger man in south africa
he is in an open car turning back to look at something his face intrigued by what he sees
english accent yes im sure thats exactly what they hoped
put him in prison a few years and with luck hed be forgotten
and maybe theyd even subdue him
we see from walkers point of view an indian woman walking along the road leading a tall camel that carries sacks of produce
two young girls in ragged saris walk with her and a boy of eight leads a smaller camel behind them
they are staring off at the car
he swings back around fascinated with what he is seeing of india
the car is an early s morris minor
well he certainly wasnt forgotten
and as soon as he got out he was back tramping the country preaching non violence and demanding a free india
everybody knows another showdowns coming but when and over what he shrugs nobody knows
well i read you account of that crowd in calcutta and that he was twisting the lions tail again
collins has suddenly slowed the car then swerves around a pair of elephants hauling logs
falteringly and i knew something had to give
and i was determined to be here when it did
how does a reporter in central america learn that gandhi was born in porbandar anyway
oh ive been a gandhi buff for a long time
collins glances at him in surprise as he steers the car around another procession of camels heading toward the port
he certainly makes good copy
the other day winston churchill called him that half naked indian fakir
walker smiles too but it soon passes
i met him once
collins looks at him in real surprise
you mean gandhi
nods back in south africa
reflectively long time ago
what was he like
lots of hair
and a little like a college freshman trying to figure everything out
well he mustve found some of the answers
he honks as he goes around a wooden wheeled cart
featuring gandhi close
he is looking straight ahead
across the emptiness of the temple ba faces him
a step forward in every worthy wish of yours i shall be your helpmate
another angle featuring walker and collins who are sitting alone in the cool shadows of the temple watching with fascination as gandhi and ba repeat their marriage ceremony for them
walker jotting notes occasionally but his eyes always glued to gandhi and ba who are in part lost in memories and echoes of a significance only they can know
a step take a fourth step that we may be ever full of joy
showing the two of them before the altar of the temple moving closer to each other
a step i will ever live devoted to you speaking words of love and praying for your happiness
close shot gandhi
take a fifth step that we may serve the people
i will follow close behind you and help to serve the people
featuring walker now too entranced by the ceremony by the depth of layered emotions in gandhi and bas voices and eyes to take any notes
take a sixth step that we may follow our vows in life
i will follow you in all our vows and duties
ba and gandhi
near to meeting now
a last step take the seventh step that we may ever live as friends
ba takes the last step so that they are face to face
you are my best friend
my highest guru and my sovereign lord
for a moment their eyes hold the many dreams and hopes and pain the love of many years
walker watches his own face taut with emotion
resume gandhi and ba
and gandhi slowly lifts his hand
then i put a sweetened wheat cake in her mouth
he touches bas lips with his extended fingers and she kisses them gently
and i put a sweetened wheat cake in his mouth
she has lifted her fingers to his mouth and he kisses them gently
featuring walker and collins both touched the overtly cynical american obviously even more than the likeable englishman
gandhi turns to them
and with that we were pronounced man and wife
solemnly we were both thirteen
a tiny beautiful city rising steeply out of the arabian sea with tall thick walled buildings half fortresses half homes their white walls tinted amber and gold now by the
early light of the sun
featuring gandhi sitting on a promontory watching the sunrise in solemn meditation
he becomes aware of the sound of footsteps and he turns to see walker approaching a little knapsack over his shoulder
walker comes to his side looking out over the bay and city truly impressed
even as a boy i thought so
walker looks down at him
gandhi scowls up in the early light
trying to keep track of you is making me change all my sleeping habits
and youve come all this way because you think something is going to happen
then weightedly is it
ive come here to think about it
they both watch the waves beat on the shore a moment the changing hues of the sunrise on the whites of porbandar
musing do you remember much of south africa
a great deal
ive traveled so far and thought so much
he smiles in self mockery and turns toward the city
as you can see my city was a sea city always filled with hindus and muslims and sikhs and jews and persians
he looks at walker
the temple where you were yesterday is of my familys sect the pranami
it was hindu of course but the priests used to read from the muslim koran and the hindu gita moving from one to the other as though it mattered not
at all which book was read as long as god was worshipped
he looks out to sea and we intercut his face with walkers the sea and the town itself as the sun turns it white
when i was a boy i used to sing a song in that temple a true disciple knows anothers woes as his own
he bows to all and despises none
earthly possessions hold him not
like all boys i said the words not thinking of what they meant or how they might be influencing me
he looks at walker
then out to the sea again shaking his head
ive traveled so far
and all ive done is come back home
walker studies him as this profound man reaches in his middle years a profound insight
featuring gandhi staring out to sea his mind locked in reflection and suddenly his head lifts his eyes become alert he is caught by some excitement which he weighs for
a moment then he stands his manner suddenly tingling with optimism
walker stares at him then at what gandhi seems to be looking at
his point of view
the waves lapping the shore below them
walker turns back to gandhi puzzled
but there is no mistaking the sudden glow in gandhis face
you know what youre going to do
gandhi looks at him a teasing smile
it would have been very uncivil of me to let you make such a long trip for nothing
the grin broadens and then he starts briskly down the promontory
walker scrambles up after him
where are you going
gulls fly over them squawking in the growing light
gandhi pauses looking up at the gulls then back down to the sea
im going back to the ashram then firmly and then im going to prove to the new viceroy that the kings writ no longer runs in india
he turns from the sea to walker his eyes confident elated then he continues on down the promontory
still baffled walker glances at the sea at him then hurries after
the waves running against the shore
close shot the viceroy a new one lord irwin
he is looking in astonishment at his principal secretary
his adc a general a brigadier a senior police officer are with him
like him they hold the same offices but are a new team
he is going to march to the sea and make salt
irwin looks at him still trying to penetrate the significance of the act
the senior police officer helps
there is a royal monopoly on the manufacture of salt sir
its illegal to make it or sell it without a government license
irwin has listened its beginning to make a little sense
all right hes breaking the law
what will he be depriving us of two rupees of salt tax
its not a serious attack on the revenue sir
its primary importance is symbolic
dont patronize me charles
the principal secretary blanches
i in this climate sir nothing lives without water or salt
our absolute control of it is a control on the pulse of india
irwin looks at his adc then paces a bit pondering it
and thats the basis of this declaration of independence
the day he sets off everyone is supposed to raise the flag of free india
then he walks some two hundred and forty miles to the sea and makes salt
a moment as irwin considers it then it is the general who speaks
i say ignore it
let them raise their damn flags let him make his salt
its only symbolic if we choose to make it so
pointedly hes going to arrive at the sea on the anniversary of the massacre at amritsar
irwin has turned to him
and this makes up his mind
general edgar is right ignore it
gandhi will find its going to take a great deal more than a pinch of salt to bring down the british empire
he is concerned enough to be angry but certain enough to be dogmatic
it is very early the light just beginning to break and we are looking out across the river toward the distant town and against the pink glow of the sky
we can see people in groups wading across the river toward the ashram
and suddenly a mass of people hidden by the embankment appear at the top of the steps coming up from the river and the camera lifts slightly with their movement
and we see that they are but the forerunners of a long tendril of humanity that stretches across the river all the way back to the distant outskirts of the city
and around the ashram many fires are burning people are cooking breakfast some are packing knapsacks for the journey others are strewing the path from the ashram with leaves
quiet just the buzz of activity from outside the building
gandhi lies on a mat and ba and mirabehn are massaging him with oil as he checks page proofs an oil lamp by his side
nehru sits cross legged next to him taking the proofs as gandhi finishes them
maulana azad sits to one side
behind them desai is making notes on gandhis instructions
to nehru the real test will come if i am arrested
if there is violence we lose all our moral advantage
this time it mustnt happen
he looks at nehru and azad solemnly to emphasize the point
nehru nods a little smile
were not beginners anymore
weve been trained by a strict sergeant major
he means gandhi of course and gandhi accepts the reference but it is the acceptance of the strict sergeant major dont fail me
then he looks to azad
if im taken maulana is to lead the march
if he is arrested patel then kripalani then yourself
ba moves to massage the top of gandhis head
you should be relaxing
gandhi grins looking at mirabehn who is massaging his legs
im sure im fit for at least five hundred miles
you should ride the pony
it is not necessary to walk to prove the point
gandhi looks at nehru a benign shrug
i have two of them bossing me now
he stands having taken the last proof sheet
azad rises with him
we must get these to the printer
he looks down at gandhi
i know it will succeed
even my mother is prepared to march
gandhi is pleasurably impressed with that
a beat hes waiting
hes not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think
smiles confidently wait and see
wait and see
he leans back and closes his eyes
ba rubs his head soothingly
nehru bends and squeezes his arm in farewell
gandhi nods not opening his eyes
nehru and azad smile at ba and leave
the sun higher but still early light
a green white and saffron flag the colors of india is pulled up an uneven pole
the sound of gentle clapping
gandhi is off to one side just in front of the veranda of his bungalow not paying attention to the ceremony
ba and mirabehn watch from the veranda as pyarelal desais new assistant with a knapsack over his own shoulders hands gandhi his
as gandhi slips it on the ashramite boy whom we saw with the goat hands him a long staff
and gandhi moves around the edge of the bungalow heading toward the entrance of the ashram
a long line of ashramites and marchers stretches from opposite the flagpole to the entrance of the ashram
as gandhi walks briskly along it they turn ready to follow him
when he nears the entrance gandhi sees walker standing in front of a collection of newsmen cameramen a newsreel crew
he begins to smile walker returns it
gandhi pauses by him
of the press youve done me a great service
a grin then a play on gandhis words to him it would have been uncivil of me to have let you make such a long trip for nothing
he turns back toward his bungalow
ba and mirabehn stand there watching desai with them
gandhi holds their gaze a second then turns and starts forward
pyarelal takes up a position next to him the marchers follow
he steps back letting gandhi proceed into the range of the cameras on his own
the crowd around the entrance throws flowers in gandhis path some calling out long live mahatma gandhi
gandhi passes the cameramen and starts along the trail
a thinner crowd here but going all along the path
to one side we see two police cars drawn up and several policemen a british officer a british sergeant and four indian constables lined up near them
as gandhi nears them walker moves up beside him
some of the newspaper cameramen trot behind to get the picture of gandhis arrest
among the newsmen we see collins
featuring gandhi and walker pyarelal just behind them all glancing ahead at the police who are now quite near
is it over if they arrest you now
not if they arrest me or a thousand or ten thousand
he looks at walker
it is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns
walker smiles a little uneasily for they are now near the police
gandhi nods to them amiably as he passes along in front of them
walker is turning watching for a move from the police but begins to grasp that there may be none
he hurries along closer to gandhi again one eye still on the police
what if they dont arrest you
what if they dont react at all
gandhi glances at him
walker too wears a knapsack
gandhi nods to it though never breaking his pace
do you still have your notebook
walker fumbles for it gandhi goes right on talking
the function of a civil resister is to provoke response
and we will continue to provoke until they respond or they change the law
they are not in control we are
that is the strength of civil resistance
he nods politely toward the british police officer at the end of the police line
walker stops letting the procession march on by him looking at the british police officer then writing busily in his notebook
collins stop by him
whatd he say
wryly he said hes in charge
a dusty approach to a dusty little village
both sides of the track are lined with peasants holding flower petals and leaves all gazing expectantly down the road
behind them the village is strung with the green white and saffron colors of independence
two large policemen stand arms akimbo at the front of them all their postures imposing and threatening though the impression is somewhat weakened by the children skirting around them
a little band of drummers and flute players suddenly begins to play
the crowd starts to jump up to see and the flower petals begin to float in the sky
long live mahatma gandhi
gandhi and the procession of marchers and ashramites stride down the dusty road toward them
a newsreel truck and crew ride along about two thirds of the way back
a car of cameramen and reporters tails at the end
he looks at walker walking along a few paces behind him at the side of the procession
he is wiping sweat from his face
are you going to walk all the way
a weary grin my name is walk er
and i intend to report it the way it is
gandhi smiles and turns back
he shakes his head
to himself my name is walk er
and grinning at it he passes by the policemen and into the cheers of the crowd
long shot high
as the procession trails into the village we see several villagers knapsacks or bundles strung over their shoulders run around the police and join the end of the procession
in the dark a large group of students comes stumbling laughing across the ditch that separates the road from the field
the student leader gets clear of the ditch and comes upon pyarelal and walker
they are standing near a group of american newsmen playing poker by a campfire
he addresses pyarelal good naturedly
weve come to join the march
what do we do
bluntly be sure youre awake in the morning
it comes from a knowledge of students
he smiles and nods off
find a place to sleep
the student leader follows his gaze and the camera pans off with his glance
we see that the numbers have grown immensely
fires dot the field and spread and spread and spread
behind walker and pyarelal the newsreel truck and three cars for reporters are spread out around the fires
we identify a couple of frenchmen and a japanese
walker looks at pyarelal and shakes his head in wonder at it all
a small indian boy is high in a dead tree
below him a couple of bone thin cattle graze in the early light as he stares off
the huge procession stretched out along the road
resume the boy
he grins as though he is privy to some great secret
a blunt rotund powerful looking woman sarojini naidu in an outrageously colorful sari strides along the dusty road as though she could cover another thousand miles and means to
the sound of hundreds of marching feet of cars some distant singing
the camera lifts and pulls back
we see that naidu is marching just behind gandhi like a determined lieutenant and that the procession has grown even greater
two newsreel trucks now four cars of reporters some people riding donkeys some walking with camels trailing loaded with belongings
and at the y junctions the newsreel crews suddenly go into action because another enormous procession is waiting to join the first mingling already making one immense column of humanity
and as they pass the camera up close we see an extraordinary variety of participants old young students peasants ladies in saris and jewels muslims hindus sikhs christian nuns untouchables
merchants some vigorous and determined others disheveled tired and determined
suddenly the sound of waves and gentle wind
the camera closing fast helicopter as the silhouette of a man appears running up a sand dune lifting his arms to the sky and the camera sweeps over him and
up revealing a crescent of beach and ocean and for a second it holds on the sea as it did at porbandar then pivots to the truly astronomical crowd thronging the shore an immense wheel of human beings and in its hub a gathering around gandhi
we descend on that center recognizing the newsmen walker pyarelal sarojini naidu and at last gandhi picking up a handful of natural salt and lifting it high
during the last of this man needs salt as he needs air and water
this salt comes from the indian ocean
the salt crystals are added to an urn already partially full
the camera pulls back and gandhi lifts the urn
all around him the pressing crowd newsreel cameramen reporters walker collins naidu pyarelal
firmly let every indian claim it as his right
a wide angle shot
gandhi in the center of the wildly cheering crowd the camera pulling back and back
and the shot becomes black and white and we hear the music of movietone news
and so once more the man of non violence has challenged the might of the british empire
and with that we get the movietone music tag and as the film fades the lights go up on a couple of civil servants move about to raise the window
shades while lord irwin stares at the blank screen set up in his office
the general the brigadier the senior police officer irwins adc and the principal secretary are all present
the two men who ran the projector are quietly dismantling it
finally irwin turns to the senior police officer who fidgets but answers the implied questions
theyre making it everywhere sir mobs of them publicly
congress leaders are selling it on the streets of delhi
were being made fools of around the world
isnt there any instruction from london
were required to stop it
he stands his mind made up
and stop it we will
he looks at the senior police officer
i dont care if we fill the jails stop it
arrest anyone any rank except gandhi
well cut his strength from under him
and then well deal with the mahatma
for the first time he is truly angry
a young british subaltern trots up to the wall and looks down
his face falls
oh my god
subalterns point of view
packed with people making salt selling salt buying salt
resume the british subaltern
he looks back
his point of view
behind him there is an open military truck and about twenty sepoys
formidable for an ordinary crowd nothing to handle this
the subaltern stiffens bravely and signals the men somewhat unconvincingly from the truck
right jump to it clear this beach
men women and children are making little paper packets of salt from piles heaped along long tables
a group of policemen barge into the room knocking tables and salt and paper in every direction with their lathis seizing some of the volunteers for arrest
in the chaos an old man calmly picks up a piece of paper from the floor a handful of salt and folds another packet
nehru is on the back of a big open truck that is stationary in the street
the truck is loaded with boxes that contain salt packets and nehru and eight or nine others are selling them to people who flock about the truck
the sound of horses
nehru lifts his head
mounted indian police are coming down either side of the street a wave of foot police running forward down the center
some of the people run others deliberately stand fast
the mounted police converge on the truck
nehru is grabbed and hurled so that he half falls half leaps to the street
one of the men with him is knocked along the ground by a policeman
he is young and vigorous and he swivels on the ground as though to strike back
nehru lunges toward him
no violence zia
and a lathi is brought smashing across the side of nehrus head
he is knocked to his knees blood streams from his head
he feels the side of his head the blood soaking his hand
he struggles to his feet facing the policeman who has struck him
repeating quietly as though to zia no violence
it stops the policeman for a second and a sergeant suddenly intrudes recognizing nehru
youre nehru im an illegal trader in salt
the sergeant sighs grimly
the desk lights are on
irwin the senior police officer the principal secretary
tension fatigue frustration as the senior police officer outlines the situation
theres been no time to keep figures but there must be ninety a hundred thousand under arrest
grimly incredibly and it still goes on
impatiently whos leading them
i dont know
nehru patel almost every congress official is in jail
and their wives and their children weve even arrested nehrus mother
shrewdly has there been any violence
distracted offhand oh in karachi the police fired on a crowd and killed a couple of people and and this hurts and in peshawar the deputy police commissioner lost his
and opened fire with a machine gun
he looks up at them quickly defensively
but hes facing a disciplinary court
you cant expect things like that not to happen when dryly i believe the question was intended to discover if there was any violence of their side
the senior police officer looks up realizing his gaffe and wishes desperately he could relive the last couple of minutes
oh no sir no im afraid not
again the machiavellian mind perhaps if we arrested gandhi it might he means incite violence
the viceroy ponders it favorably
to senior police officer hes addressed this letter directly to you has he
yes sir he has
the usual indias salt belongs to india but then he says flatly that he personally is going to lead a raid tomorrow on the dharasana salt works
calmly thank him for his letter and put him in jail
the senior police officer is brought up by the chill directness of it
he looks at irwin and the principal secretary for a moment in uncertainty
then yes sir
it will be my pleasure
as he turns to leave irwin speaks almost offhandedly
and fields keep that salt works open
the senior police officer stares at him then delighted yes sir
barbed wire stretches on either side of the stockade like entrance
above the gate we see the sign dharasana salt works
before it six british police officers and two indian police officers command a large troop of indian policemen
they face their opposition unmoving tense
the camera pans from them across a sloping dip in the ground to a huge group of volunteers lining up to face the police as tautly as the police face
walker is off to one side climbing to stand in the back of collins car
he watches looking tensely from one group to the other almost terrified by what seems about to happen
collins leans against the back of the car near him watching with an equally appalled expectancy
there are two other reporters near them
from walkers point of view
we see mirabehn and some indian women quietly placing stretchers and tables of bandages near a group of tents where the volunteers have been housed
walker turns back to the two opposing groups at the salt works entrance
we hear only a shuffle of feet the clank of a lathi against a metal police buckle
the air itself seems breathless with tension
he has approached the chief police officer
he stops before him politely
i would like admission to the works
equally politely i am sorry sir
that cannot be allowed
azad looks at him a second then glances at the troops
he is clearly afraid but there is an air of tragic inevitability in his face
he moves back to address the volunteers
last night they took gandhiji from us
they expect us to lose heart or to fight back
we will not lose heart we will not fight back
in his name we will be beaten
as he has taught us we will not raise a hand
long live mahatma gandhi
he turns and starts down the dip toward the gate and the waiting lathis of the police
a series of shots as azad leads the first row of volunteers down and up the dip
we intercut walker frozen watching the inevitable onslaught the british police commanding officer ready to give the first order
and with the volunteers a foot from them the police strike with their lathis
a groan of empathic anguish from the waiting volunteers but then we get a series of shots as the next row moves forward and the horror of the one sided
mayhem proceeds heads are cracked faces split ribs smashed and yet one row of volunteers follows another and another into the unrelenting police who knock bleeding bodies out of the way down into the dip swing till sweat pours from their faces and bodies
and through it we intercut with mirabehn and the indian women rescuing the wounded carrying them on stretchers to be bandaged
we see walker helping once or twice turning watching torn between being a professional spectator and a normal human being
and always the volunteers coming never stopping never offering resistance
and finally on sound there is an insistent click click click like a thud of the lathis but becoming clearly the slap of an impatient hand on a telephone cradle
and out of the carnage of the salt works we dissolve to close shot a telephone cradle being pounded
walker is at the phone at a table in the corner of the small cluttered store
his clothes are matted with blood and dirt
into the phone hello
goddammit dont cut me off
then suddenly hes through
okay yeah right
and he continues urgently reading the story that lies on his notes on the little stand before him
they walked with heads up without music or cheering or any hope of escape from injury or death
his voice is taut harshly professional
it went on and on and on
women carried the wounded bodies from the ditch until they dropped from exhaustion
but still it went on
he shifts the mangled notes and comes to his last paragraph
he speaks it trying only half successfully to keep the emotion from his voice
whatever moral ascendance the west held was lost today
india is free for she has taken all that steel and cruelty can give and she has neither cringed nor retreated
on walker close
his sweating blood and dirt stained face near tears
in the words of his followers long live mahatma gandhi
the camera moves across the empty room and discovers irwin standing by himself looking out of the window down into the street
his numb motionless face is stirred to consciousness by something outside
he focuses somberly on it
through the formal entrance comes a single black car
a motorcycle policeman precedes it
the black car pulls up before the front of the palace and stops
there is no sign of activity
it is as though the building and grounds are deserted except for irwin alone in his office
gandhi gets out of the car
he too is alone
in his dhoti and shawl he starts to mount the grand stairs
the great palace the magnificent entrance and the little man in the dhoti who in a sense has conquered it all marching to the great doors
two gurkhas spring to attention and the doors are swung open
the principal secretary with a look of faint distaste for someone out of shot discreetly moves out of the doors and closes them behind him
featuring gandhi just inside the door
he is looking across the wide office
i am aware that i must have given you much cause for irritation your excellency
i hope it will not stand between us as men
irwin is in shadows behind his desk looking still in some kind of shock staring at gandhi
gandhi i have instructions to request your attendance at an all government conference in london to discuss to discuss the possible independence of india
he faces gandhi stiffly
the whirr of a camera and a swift cut to wide screen but slightly under cranked with the bad cutting and predictable music of the old newsreels
gandhi mirabehn and gandhis secretary desai waving goodbye from the boat deck of their ship as it sails mirabehn is holding the tether of a goat all of them smiling
at the camera like voyagers everywhere
gandhi on the steps of kingsley hall in the east end of london being greeted by a cheering crowd
mirabehn holds an umbrella over him as he takes a bouquet from a little child
the now gray haired charlie andrews beams possessively at his side
gandhi in his dhoti waving to a small crowd as he enters the gates of buckingham palace
a london bobby watches
gandhi taking his seat at the conference table among the formally in some maharajahs cases elaborately dressed delegates
a gavel is struck and ramsay macdonald begins his opening address
i think our first duty is to recognize that there is not one india but several a hindu india a muslim india and india of princely states
and all these must be respected and cared for not just one
beneath its unctuous political veneer it is blatantly divisive and clearly reveals the true intent of the conference
as gandhi looks at macdonald we read on his face his perception of the sad truth
gandhi mirabehn and charlie walking under an umbrella in the rain their heads bent in glum conversation
gandhi being welcomed and kissed by a group of millworkers outside a large mill entrance identified by the sign greenfield cotton mill lancashire
he is hugged and squeezed by some hefty female millworkers all grinning happily gandhi not least
gandhi in a radio studio seated at a table a large microphone labeled cbs before him technicians and mirabehn in the glass booth behind him walker across the table from
him the on the air sign bright
to walker do i speak into that
walker cringes glancing at the lighted on the air sign
he signals yes frantically
are they ready
do i start
he glances at the booth
everybody including walker and mirabehn are nodding yes
gandhi shrugs grins at everyones excitement and begins
i am glad to speak to america where so many friends exist that i know only in my heart
as the speech continues in the thin static y tones of thirties radio we see mirabehn and the technicians listening in the control room
walker across the table from gandhi
the outside of broadcasting house
the empire state building and manhattan
a mid western farmhouse
a thirties radio set in a thirties american living room
a family listening kids playing on the floor half ignoring it the mother ironing the father in an armchair a newspaper open
continuing over all i think your interest and the worlds has fallen on india not only because we are struggling for freedom but because the way we are doing so
is unique as far as history shows us
here in europe mighty nations are it seems already contemplating another war though i think they and all the world are sick to death of bloodspilling
all of us are seeking a way out and i flatter myself that perhaps the ancient land of india will offer such a way
if we are to make progress we must not repeat history but make history
and i myself will die before i betray our belief that love is a stronger weapon than hate
gandhi shaking hands with macdonald outside no
downing street macdonald smiling the politicians smile gandhi smiling rather sadly
gandhi on the deck of a boat sitting on a deck chair wrapped in blankets staring somberly out to sea
reverse angle the wake of the boat in the vast ocean
the gentle sounds of the country
a girl of twelve leads a limping goat slowly across the grass
she pauses and looks up questioningly
reverse angle close
gandhi is watching from the porch of his bungalow
we can tell he is sitting and turned to watch the goat but we see only him and a portion of the bungalow behind him
it is only a sprain
take her to the river and well make a mud pack for her
go i wont be long
he turns back
he is spinning expertly and gathered on the porch with him are nehru and jinnah and patel and azad and kripalani
desai and pyarelal are inconspicuously in attendance as always pyarelal now clearly sharing desais role as secretary
so the truth is after all your travels all your efforts theyve stopped the campaign and sent you home empty handed
he is in his white suit the black ribboned pince nez
he sits on a wicker chair nehru and patel lean against the railing azad and kripalani sit on the floor like gandhi
they are only clinging to old dreams looks up from his spinning to jinnah and trying to split us in the old way
but the will has gone independence will drop like a ripe apple
the only question is when another glance at jinnah and how
i say when is now and we will determine how
gandhi winds up what he has done and starts to rise
they are preparing for war
i will not support it but i do not intend to take advantage of their danger
blithely but to the point thats when you take advantage
gandhi has moved toward the steps
he stops and looks at patel
a wry gentle smile
that is just another way of striking back
we have come a long way together with the british
when they leave we want to see them off as friends
he starts down the steps and heads for the river
and now if youll excuse me there is something i must attend to
he looks at jinnah and shrugs
jinnah takes it less philosophically and his eyes burn with anger as he watches gandhi head for the young girl with the injured goat
resignedly mud packs
gandhi is moving with the stream of passengers disembarking from the third class section
ba and mirabehn are struggling along behind him desai and pyarelal completing the little group
they pass a newspaper stand hitlers armies sweep on
as they move out into the flux of the station we see many uniforms the sense of a nation readying for war
a british captain stands before a full platoon of indian troops
as gandhi approaches a british lt
colonel and his adjutant a captain move out from one side of the troops
gandhi stops looks up at him at the troops behind him
i have instructions to inquire as to the subject of your speech tonight
gandhi shakes his head with a weary grin
the value of goats milk in daily diet
into his eyes but you can be sure i will also speak against war
the british colonel signals back to the troops
im sorry sir
that cant be allowed
as a detail marches up to them the colonels adjutant speaks gently to ba
its all right mrs
i have orders to return with you and your companion to the mahatmas ashram
if you take my husband i intend to speak in his place
she stares at the adjutant belligerently
he looks flummoxed
long shot high
the colonel and his adjutant striding toward the exit of the station
following behind them a detail of six soldiers accompanying gandhi
the camera tracks across the platform and we see they are being followed by a detail of six soldiers accompanying ba
and the camera tracks again and we see they are being followed by a detail of six soldiers accompanying mirabehn
a jeep bounces along the road
it is driven by an american lieutenant and his passenger is a woman dressed in an american war correspondents uniform margaret bourke white
as the jeep passes the camera we pan with it and see the walls of a palace ahead
wait a minute
the jeep slithers to a stop and bourke white grabs a camera that is strapped around her stands and takes a picture of the palace
the palace looks evocative a lonely incongruous building
it was the aga khans palace but theyve turned it into a prison
bourke white slips back down into her seat we see the arm band on her jacket press
the lieutenant starts the jeep up and they head toward the gate where we see a british soldier on guard
shouting over the motor theyve got most of the leading congress politicians in this one
but nehru and some others are over in dehra dun
your timings pretty lucky
they had your mr
gandhi cut off from the press but last month his personal secretary died and theyve let up on the restrictions
bourke white just absorbs it staring at the palace taking in the experience with the appetite of her breed and her own particular sensitivity
gandhi sits by the window that is grilled rather than barred
he is spinning in a shaft of light and looking off as we hear a camera click and the rustle of movement
his hair only half gray in london is now white
yes i have heard of life magazine
i have even heard of margaret bourke white
but i dont know why either should be interested in an old man sitting in prison when the world is blowing itself to pieces
bourke white who has been moving crouching to shoot him and the light sags back against the wall relaxing at last
she has a smile as penetrating and warming as his
a beat and she smiles youre the only man i know who makes his own clothes
gandhi grins and glances toward his dhoti
ah but for me thats not much of an accomplishment
meaning he doesnt wear many clothes
bourke white bursts into an appreciative radiance already she has assessed him and been won
gandhi walks along bourke white loping along beside him a little distance away listening but searching too for an angle a moment that is right
no prison is rather agreeable to me and there is no doubt that after the war independence will come
my only worry is what shape it will take
jinnah has stop
she has gandhi in the foreground a soldier on the wall above and behind him
now go on just as you were
gandhi shrugs but suffers it
we feature him low from her point of view as he walks on the soldier pacing on the wall in the background
what shape it will take
jinnah has what
at first disconcerted but then flowing jinnah has has cooperated with the british
it has given him power and the freedom to speak and he has filled the muslims with fears of what will happen to them in a country that is predominantly
he stops lowering his head gravely
that i find hard to bear even in prison
a spinning wheel works rapidly
the camera lifts
gandhi is at the wheel and he is smiling off at bourke white who is trying ineptly to imitate him on another spinning wheel
the garden they are in has gone to seed a bit but with latticed fretwork in the walls dappling sunlight on the grass and shrubs it is still beautiful
archly but emphatically of the spinning i do not see it as the solution of the twentieth centurys problems
shes grinning at her own frustration and she keeps trying but theres no doubt she means it
gandhis smile broadens
wryly he lifts his own product a tiny roll of thread
i have a friend who keeps telling me how much it costs him to keep me in poverty
and they both laugh
a guard on the wall distantly looks at them wonderingly
a bit more seriously but i know happiness does not come with things even twentieth century things
it can come from work and pride in what you do
he looks at her steadily
it will not necessarily be progress for india if she simply imports the unhappiness of the west
and she responds to the sophistication of that observation
he pivots around moving beside her and slowly demonstrates the process taking her hands guiding her
bourke white watches him as much as the wheel
but do you really believe you could use non violence against someone like hitler
a thoughtful pause not without defeats and great pain
he looks at her
but are there no defeats in this war no pain
for a moment the thought hangs and then gandhi takes their hands back to the spinning
what you cannot do is accept injustice
from hitler or anyone
you must make the injustice visible be prepared to die like a soldier to do so
and he smiles a little wisely at her
is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that
that is what you get for distracting me
what do you expect when you talk like that
trying to unravel the mess i expect you to show as much patience as i am now
his tone is not altogether patient
she looks at him in surprise and he sighs tolerantly
then reflectively every enemy is a human being even the worst of them
and he believes he is right and you are a beast
and now a little smile
and if you beat him over the head you will only convince him
but you suffer to show him that he is wrong your sacrifice creates an atmosphere of understanding if not with him then in the hearts of the rest of the
community on whom he depends
bourke white looks at him and there is enough sense in this argument to give her pause
if you are right you will win after much pain
he looks at her then smiles in his own ironic way
if you are wrong well then only you will suffer the blows
she stares at him and we know she thinks him much more profound than she had thought initially
ba mirabehn and bourke white sit on straw mats around the room an oil lamp is the only light
it is womens talk but ba is defending her husband speaking simply but with total conviction
not at all
bapu has always said there were two kinds of slavery in india one for women one for the untouchables and he has always fought against both
bourke white accepts it at face value
she opens another line of inquiry
does it rankle being separated from him this way
but we see each other in the day
delicately but not at night
shes terribly curious but she doesnt want to offend
ba sees both the curiosity and the hesitancy
she smiles across at mirabehn then in hindu philosophy the way to god is to free yourself of possessions and the passions that inflame to anger and jealousy
bapu has always struggled to find the way to god
you mean he he gave up how to phrase it finally married life
again ba smiles
four times he tried and failed
mirabehn and bourke white grin
the older woman gives a wistful smile
but then he took a solemn vow
the implication is it was a long time ago
and he has never broken it
a beat not yet
she looks at them soberly and then they all burst into laughter like girls
military move quietly but urgently in and out around the main entrance
two military ambulances are drawn up nearby
a british major comes down the steps quickly
he is almost at the bottom when a british army doctor starts to go up them
the major signals him to one side
they talk quietly and confidentially
ive got permission to move her he can go too
the doctor shakes his head
shes had a coronary throm a serious heart failure
she wouldnt survive a trip
its best to leave her and hope
the major looks defeated and depressed by the news
ba lies on a mat a pillow beneath her head her eyes closed her breathing short
mirabehn sits next to her rubbing a hand up and down her arm
gandhi sits a little distance away staring at the floor and into nothingness
pyarelal sits inconspicuously behind him
azad and patel come to the doorway patel makes the pranam toward ba and holds it as he obviously prays
azad has bowed his head and he too is clearly making some prayer for her
finally azad takes just a step forward
gandhi looks up at him
for a moment he folds his hands absently then he stands
he moves to bas side and kneels
she does not open her eyes
it is time for my walk i wont be long
bas eyes flutter open
she holds her hand out to him and he takes it
when he goes to release it she clutches it
gandhi hesitates and then he sits holding bas hand in his lap
he looks across at mirabehn and nods for her to go
mirabehn smiles weakly gives ba a last little rub of farewell and stands
patel stands letting mirabehn pass before him and do down the corridor with azad
he looks back
his point of view
gandhi sitting holding bas hand his eyes once more on the floor in their empty stare
another angle later
the light has changed
a fly moves along a small section of the floor that still contains a ribbon of the dying sunlight
gandhi still sits holding bas hand staring into nothingness
the doctor appears in the doorway
he pauses nods amiably to gandhi though gandhi does not react to his presence at all
moving quietly the doctor goes to the other side of ba and crouches and lifts her wrist to feel her pulse
he holds it for a moment then lifts his eyes in doubt and sudden fateful apprehension
he glances at her then slowly lowers her arm and puts the branches of his stethoscope in his ears
he puts the acoustic bell over her heart
a moment and he lifts it slowly his face confirming for us what he and we already know there is no heartbeat
he glances at pyarelal who only lowers his eyes
the doctor turns his head slowly to gandhi
his point of view
his posture is utterly unchanged bas hand still in his lap his eyes still staring emptily at the floor in front of him but suddenly tears begin to run down
he does not move there is no change in his empty stare but the tears continue to flow
the funeral pyre burns its work almost done
mirabehn patel azad pyarelal stand with other prisoners and the military wardens in solemn obeisance to the dead and the living for gandhi sits a little distance from the pyre
wrapped in his shawl staring at the dying embers in tragic and impenetrable isolation as though he may never move again
close shot mirabehn watching him her face wet with tears
extreme close shot
a piece of cloth shimmering in a stiff breeze
for a moment we hold it in silence and then we hear the sound of an aircraft growing louder and louder
and slowly the camera pulls back and we see that the cloth is part of a pennant of the nose of an aircraft
we cut from the pennant to see the aircraft stopping before a reception area a carpet rolled out toward its door
an indian regimental band strikes up martial music
a detachment of indian royal air force comes to attention at the shouted command of their nco
featuring the aircraft doors
an elaborately dressed military aide opens the door and lord louis mountbatten resplendent in naval uniform steps out onto the platform
he pauses and renders a salute
nehru lady mountbatten and dignitaries
english and indians watch as mountbatten approaches a group of microphones identified as nbc cbs bbc etc
we have come to crown victory with friendship to assist at the birth of an independent india and to welcome her as an equal member in the british commonwealth of
a little smile
i am here to see that i am the last british viceroy ever to have the honor of such a reception
he grins in his youthful beguiling manner and makes the pranam to the cheering crowd
it is cut off by the sound of a door being opened close
jinnah stands by one of the great pillars of the immense portico
it is a break in their independence conference and as he lights a cigarette a weary gandhi approaches him with azad
jinnahs anger is clearly too deep to be left at the conference table
he slaps his lighter shut and addresses gandhi in hushed but fiercely felt words
i dont give a damn for the independence of india
i am concerned about the slavery of muslims
nehru and patel are approaching from the conference room both of them looking worn and angry too
jinnah raises his voice deliberately so nehru will hear
i will not sit by to see the mastery of the british replaced by the mastery of the hindus
patiently not yet believing it cant be settled muslim and hindu are the right and left eye of india
no one will be slave no one master
jinnah sneers at the idea though he cools a little
the world is not made of mahatma gandhis
he looks at nehru and patel
i am talking about the real world
the real india has muslims and hindus in every village and every city
how do you propose to separate them
where there is a muslim majority that will be pakistan
the rest is your india
a forced patience mohammed the muslims are in a majority on two different sides of the country
acidly let us worry about pakistan you worry about india
gandhi is staring at jinnah trying to fathom the source of his anger and fear
he turns to see that mountbatten has been standing in the open door to the conference room as torn as gandhi by the conflict feeling it best controlled in formal
gentlemen perhaps we should recommence
gandhi nods and reluctantly the adversaries move back to the conference room
gandhi is last through the door
he pauses by mountbatten a little sigh how difficult how difficult then he puts a friendly hand on mountbattens shoulder and the two of them enter together
featuring godse waving a black flag and shouting
with others death to jinnah
death to jinnah
we have pulled back and we see a whole gathering of hindu youths near the entrance to the ashram
many wave black flags
a couple of trucks that have brought them and a car are along the path
kallenbach is stepping out of an old open austin that he has put in a waiting position near the entrance to the path
the chanting shout death to jinnah
the youths and kallenbach look back toward the ashram
featuring gandhis bungalow
nehru has stepped out onto the porch and he glares at the youths
it is his presence that has silenced them
gandhi is rising from the floor where his spinning wheel sits
he stops halfway up listening then a weary sigh
thank god theyve stopped
mirabehn is spinning across the room
she lifts her head as a signal to someone out of shot
gandhis two grand nieces manu and abha who help mirabehn now that ba is gone rise quickly at mirabehns signal manu to help with his shawl abha to hold his
sandals so that he can slip into them
im your grand uncle but i can still walk either of you into the ground and i dont need to be pampered this way
its cross hes worried about other things
mirabehn just smiles at it
gandhi looks down at abha and taps her sharply on the top of the head
finish your quota of spinning
she nods obediently the flicker of a smile around her mouth youthful irrepressible
the beauty of it almost saddens gandhi
he taps her again gently and goes out
kallenbach shoos a chicken from the back seat of the austin and dusts off the seat
he steps back out
gandhi is approaching with nehru and azad pyarelal trails close behind
we have seen azad and pyarelal come out on the porch behind nehru
as gandhi near the car a hindu youth with a black flag calls to him
dont do it
they are all awed timid even in his actual presence and the mood of their gathering has changed altogether
gandhi looks at the youth and the line of others
impatiently what do you want me not to do
not to meet with mr
fiercely i am a muslim
he stares at them then relents
and a hindu and a christian and a jew and so are all of you
when you wave those flags and shout you send fear into the hearts of your brothers
he sweeps them sternly with his eyes all his fatigue and strain showing
this is not the india i want
for gods sake stop it
and he lowers his head and moves on to the car where kallenbach holds the door for him nehru azad and pyarelal following
as they get into the car we see the car that sits by the two trucks that have brought the youths
in the back seat we see two men one of whom is prakash the bearded man at gandhis assassination
jinnah is on the small balcony of this elaborate room
he is looking down in a slightly supercilious manner
as usual he is impeccably dressed
now please if youve finished your prayers could we begin with business
he has been looking at gandhi who sits on the floor of the large room some distance from him just lifting his head from prayers
nehru patel and azad are on the same side of the room as gandhi
they rise from prayer as jinnah comes down the steps to them
gandhi hesitates then begins
my dear jinnah you and i are brothers born of the same mother india
if you have fears i want to put them to rest
jinnah listens impatiently skeptically
gandhi just glances in nehrus direction
i am asking panditji to stand down
i want you to be the first prime minister of india jinnah raises an eyebrow of interest
to name your entire cabinet to make the head of every government department a muslim
and jinnah has drawn himself up
his vanity is too great not to be touched by that prospect
he measures gandhi for a moment to see that he is sincere and when he is satisfied with that he turns slowly to nehru patel and azad
nehru glances at patel
they have all been taken by surprise by the offer and do not feel what gandhi feels
nehru looks hesitantly at gandhi
bapu for me and the rest his hand gestures to patel and azad if that is what you want we will accept it
but out there he indicates the streets already there is rioting because hindus fear you are going to give too much away
if you did this no one could control it
it bears the stamp of undeniable truth
gandhis eyes sag with the despair of a man whose last hope whose faith has crumbled around him
jinnah smiles cynically he spreads his hands see
it is your choice
do you want an independent india and an independent pakistan
or do you want civil war
gandhi stares at him numbly
on a platform in the foreground mountbatten and nehru
a band plays the indian national anthem loudly and there is the roar of a tremendous crowd as the green white and saffron flag of india is raised on the
on a platform in the foreground jinnah and a british plenipotentiary
a band plays the new pakistani national anthem loudly and there is the roar of a tremendous crowd as the white green with white crescent flag of pakistan is raised
on the flagpole
the little flagpole is empty the rope dangling flapping loosely down the pole
gandhi sits on the porch of his bungalow spinning
the hum of the spinning wheel
inside we can just see mirabehn spinning too
but apart from that he is alone the whole ashram seems deserted
we hear the sound of a bell on one of the goats fairly distant
he is taking the goat and tethering it near the path of the ashram
he stills the bell with his hand
as he ties it the camera angle widens and we see margaret bourke white sitting on the grass watching kallenbach and looking off toward gandhis bungalow
arent you being a little overprotective
kallenbach looks at her
her tone criticizes more than his stilling the goats bell
tomorrow photograph him
i came all this way because i believed the picture of independence day was of him here alone
kallenbach stands and looks across at her judging then appealing to her humanity
it is violence and the fear of violence that have made today what it is
give him the dignity of his grief
bourke white grabs a clump of grass twists it free and sighs
she tosses the grass vaguely at the goat
and while were sitting here feeding goats what will happen to all the muslims in india and the hindus in pakistan
kallenbach stops staring absently at the ground ahead then gandhi will pray for them
the camera is high helicopter and moving and from its position we meet and then pass over an immense column of refugees ten twenty abreast moving down one side of
the railroad track toward camera
women children the sick the aged all burdened with bedding utensils household treasures useless bric a brac and trudging with them every type of cart wagon rickshaw pulled by donkey
camel bike oxen
it stretches endlessly to the horizon
tiny green white and saffron flags here and there indicate that it is a hindu column and spotted through it we see people in fresh bandages some on stretchers sticking
out like radioactive tracers in the huge artery of frightened humanity
and the camera lifts and tilts slowly swinging to the opposite direction and as it does reveals another vast column across the track several yards away moving in the opposite
direction veiled women in purdah the crescent flag of muslim pakistan here and there
as the camera levels and speeds along it we see that this column too reaches to the horizon that it too carries its wounded
an unbelievable flood of desperate humanity
the sound of the vast refugee column
a womans arms cradle a baby in swaddling
blood has seeped through the swaddling in three or four places some of it dried
flies buzz around it
and suddenly we hear the womans sobs and she rocks the baby and we know it has stopped moving stopped breathing and a male hand gently touches the back of
the baby checking and the camera pans up to the face of a man
again in extreme close shot so we cannot tell whether they are hindu or muslim
and the mans eyes knot and he swings out of shot as he runs in fury and rage at the other column
the two columns and a howl of hate and grief
and the camera sweeps to where men are running at each other across the track some already fighting
knives pangas hatchets women screaming and running a besieged wagon tipped
and as the fighting grows more fierce streams of men from each column run back to partake but the bulk of the two columns hurries off scrambling running some leaving
their bundles fleeing the melee in terror
a muslim pulled through broken glass in an urban market shop
night a hindu temple daubed with blood the bodies of women and children strewn before it screams the sound of fighting
mud and straw houses burning figures running through them
a city street a truck crashes into a barricade of rickshaws and bales and is set upon by a swarm of knife and panga bearing men
from the back of the truck opponents with swords and clubs leap into battle
it and the adjoining office have been made into something like operations rooms
military and civilian aides move back and forth
telephones at work everywhere
a huge map on the wall is constantly having data changed by people receiving messages there
nehru is glancing at a telex message he turns and gives it back to the military aide whos given it to him
fast curt no
there just are not that many troops
whats he to do
what he can
patel has a message he was going to present to him
he hesitates grins dismally and crumples the message no use
he looks at patel with haggard eyes
he was right
its insane anything would have been better
have you found him
nehru nods solemnly
hes in noakhali
patel reacts to that surprise apprehension
hes tramping from village to village no police no troops trying to quell the madness single handedly
he sighs half in admiration half in hopeless exasperation at the old mans audacity
maulana has gone to bring him back
patel nods grimly the noisy chaos of the room
someone shouts at nehru prime minister
in silence looking tragic tired and defeated
he is sitting in his characteristic manner staring down at the carpet before him
dull lifeless what you have done in noakhali is a miracle bapu a miracle but millions are on the move millions
there is no way to stop it
and no one can count the dead
the camera angle has changed
we are in patel and azad are there and pyarelal of course and with them now the giant figure of abdul ghaffar khan the first time we have seen him
among gandhis intimate group
in calcutta its like civil war
the muslims rose and there was a bloodbath and now the hindus are taking revenge and if we cant stop it therell be no hope for the hindus left in
an eye for an eye making the whole world blind
it is an empty and despairing echo of gandhis words
arent there any troops to spare
tense fragile nothing nothing
the divisions in bombay and delhi can hardly keep the peace now
and each fresh bit of news creates another wave of mad
he has turned and seen gandhi standing slowly
it has almost stopped him
could we cut all news off
i know bapu please
where are you going
sounding like an old man i dont want to hear more
he is moving toward the door
it stops them all
pyarelal moves tentatively to open the door
impatiently we need your help
there is nothing i can give
where are you going
gandhi turns looks at him bleakly
we are high
there are fires the sounds of spasmodic gunfire of looting screams the roar of police vehicles and occasional sirens
the camera zooms in on a poor quarter of artisan dwellings in narrow streets
outside one of the houses is a car an army jeep policemen a few soldiers and a group of people
it seems a little island of calm in a sea of wild chaos
on the roof of the house a figure moves into the light
the figure is gandhi
he peers down at the dark rioting streets
azad tahib a muslim whose house this is mirabehn and pyarelal are with him along abdul ghaffar khan
a police commissioner moves to gandhis side demanding his attention
sir please i dont have the men to protect you not in a muslim house
not this quarter
i am staying with the friend of a friend
there is a sudden commotion just below them and angry shouts death to muslims
death to muslims
gandhi peers down
his point of view
a surging gang of youths many carrying torches and far outnumbering the little group of police and soldiers are shouting up at the roof
we see three or four black flags and stains of blood on many of them
a few hold knives still wet with blood
there he is
a feral roar goes up at the sight of gandhi but he stands unmoving
his voice emotional tearful why are you staying at the home of a muslim
they killed my family
it is a comment too grave for glibness and gandhi is obviously struck by the pain of it
he pauses for a moment staring down at the youth because forgiveness is the gift of the brave
he makes it mean the youth
for a second it makes an impact but then the youth shouts his defiance at him and his message
to hell with you gandhi
an angry chorus of acclamation when it dies to the youth go do as your mother and father would wish you to do
it is ambiguous open ended meaning anything your mother and father would wish you to do
tears flush from the boys eyes and he stares at gandhi with a kind of hopeless anguish and rage
but the impact is on the youth alone around him the others begin to take up the chant death to muslims
death to muslims
gandhi turns from the street
he looks at the police commissioner at his fatigue his concern his manifest respect
gandhi musters a weary smile
i have lived a lifetime
if i had shunned death or feared it i would not be here
nor would you be concerned for me
he lets it sink in then he takes the commissioners arm and moves back toward the center of the roof
leave me and take your men
an understanding touch of the arm
you have more important things to worry about
the commissioner looks at him uncertain not knowing what to do as the angry chanting continues above the sound of rioting
an old inadequate hospital dark cavernous
margaret bourke white is moving among the densely packed litter of wounded women
she is positioning herself to photograph gandhi who is speaking to a woman who cradles a small baby
the corridors behind him are even more packed
the few doctors and nurses hardly have room to move
azad and mirabehn are behind him as he moves on and behind them like a giant guardian abdul ghaffar khan
we hear bapu bapu muttered quietly here and there
gandhi bends to a woman whose face is bandaged and a cruel wound is half exposed between her mouth and eye
allah be with you
there are tears in gandhis eyes now
and with you
he touches her wrinkled hand
i cannot help you pray
and the weight of his helplessness hangs on him
a streetcar tram crashes into a barricade of carts rickshaws a couple of old cars smashing through to breach the barricade but stopped in the end by the mass of
the streetcar is loaded with indian troops and they break from the stalled vehicle to chase a gang of hindus organized runs down the street from the troops some dragging
the bodies of victims with them
we see several hindu black flags
he speaks across his desk to a senior police commissioner
the same activity going on in the background
there will not be a hindu police and a muslim police
there is one police
an aide slips a newspaper on his desk in front of him
he doesnt look at it till the senior commissioner lowers his head and turns accepting defeat
then nehru glances at the paper
in thick headlines gandhi a fast unto death
nehru doesnt move for a moment
then he lifts his face slowly to his aide
why must i read news like this in the paper
the aide shakes his head theres no answer
nehru lowers his head again it is like another burden on a man who already has too many
he grips his temples
a terrible sigh
arrange a plane
we will go friday
nehru thinks on it solemnly then nods yes
the sounds of rioting and looting on nearby streets but here a mass of people are gathered
many youths with black flags
two black government limousines
police and soldiers
they are looking off to it runs up the side of the building and is lined with waiting people
nehru and patel are climbing the stairs moving past them almost irritably as they mutter nehru nehru patel and make the pranam to the eminent men
in the heat of the city tahibs rooftop is still gandhis home and has become a center of activity
azad clears someone aside and ushers nehru and patel under the canopy awning
nehru pauses as he lowers his head
his point of view
gandhi lies curled awkwardly on his side of the cot
he is writing pyarelal taking the pages as he finishes both ignoring all the people the sounds of gunfire and distant shouting but he looks tired and tightens his jaw
occasionally in pain
the camera pans
a doctor sits near the foot of the cot abdul ghaffar khan beyond him
near the other edge of the canopied area mirabehn sits with bourke white
they are whispering quietly but mirabehn has stopped on seeing nehru and she smiles a relieved greeting
she knows gandhis feeling for him
bourke white stares at him and patel for a second and then her hand goes slowly almost reflexively for her camera
nehru crosses and kneels so that he is almost at gandhis eyeline
gandhi must take his eyes from his writing to look and he is almost moved to tears at the sight of nehru
his hand shakes a little as he holds it out to him
gandhi turns to pat their joined hands with his other hand
he does so with effort and at last he sees patel
he looks him over
you have gained weight
you must join me in the fast
patel sits near the head of the cot so the three of them are on a level
outside the canopied area bourke white is crouched her camera framing the three of them
wittily warmly if i fast i die
if you fast people go to all sorts of trouble to keep you alive
gandhi smiles and reaches to touch hands with him
bapu forgive me ive cheated
i could have come earlier
but your fast has helped
these last days peoples minds have begun to turn to this bed and away from last nights atrocity
but now it is enough
gandhi shakes his head
all that has happened is that ive grown a little thinner
it is despairingly sincere
but nehru feels he has an antidote for that despair
the distant sound of an explosion
tomorrow five thousand muslim students of all ages are marching here in calcutta for peace
the real point and five thousand hindu students are marching with them
it is all organized
bourke white captures the sense of elation in his face
from her discreet distance she lowers the camera holding it against her mouth waiting for gandhis response
gandhi nods to nehru accepting the news with a sad wistfulness
im glad but it will not be enough
nehru isnt prepared for this resistance
he glances at patel and we see that they recognize that their bland conviction that they could talk him out of the fast was deeply misplaced
nehru turns back this time no confidence only concern
a forced smile
bapu you are not so young anymore
gandhi smiles pain etched in his eyes
he touches nehrus hand
dont worry for me death will be a deliverance
there is water in his eyes but his words have the weight of a man truly determined to die
i cannot watch the destruction of all i have lived for
nehru stares at him feeling the sudden fear that gandhi means it
patel mirabehn azad bourke white are gripped by the same realization
an outside broadcast truck is parked among the usual crowd grown even larger now and more women among them
the sounds of distant fighting
the senior technician in earphones signals across to mirabehn
she holds a microphone by gandhi who is lying on his side
he seems almost out of touch
gandhi looks at her and then the microphone
when he speaks into the microphone his voice is very weak
each night before i sleep i read a few words from the gita and the koran and the bible
we intercut with bourke white and those on the roof watching tonight i ask you to share these thoughts of god with me
and now we go into the streets intercutting with gandhi but seeing hindus listening around loudspeakers on corners in little eating houses muslim shops where people live in the back
and neighbors gathering defensively in groups
the books are there but he does it from memory of course i will begin with the bible where the words of the lord are love thy neighbor as thyself
and then our beloved gita which says the world is a garment worn by god thy neighbor is in truth thyself
and finally the holy koran we shall remove all hatred from our hearts and recline on couches face to face a band of brothers
he leans back exhausted
mirabehn is looking at him she starts to sing softly
lead kindly light amidst the circling gloom
gandhi his eyes closed takes it up in his weak croaking voice
the night is dark and i am far from home lead thou me on
two police motorcycles lead a black limousine to a stop before tahibs house
the crowd now gathered is very large
more mixed than before but still predominantly of youths many still with black flags
nehru gets out of the limousine with a muslim leader a tough looking man who carries himself with the authority and power of a mobster suhrawardy
and they start to go up the outside stairs
suddenly we hear the shout death to gandhi
death to gandhi
and nehru turns pushing past suhrawardy fiercely and going back onto the street
he runs at the crowd where the shout comes once more from the back
his face is wild with anger and shock
hysterically who dares say such things
and he is running at them and they spread in fear
kill me first
where are you
kill me first
the crowd has spread from him all along the street they stand against the walls of the houses staring at him terrified to move
we see just in passing the frightened apprehensive faces of godse and near him apte and karkare
nehru stands staring at them all his face seething with anger
we are featuring a copy of life magazine
on the cover is a picture of rioting men fighting and diagonally a cut out of gandhi lying on his cot
the caption reads an old mans battle
as the magazine starts to be opened it is suddenly put to one side
mirabehn is rising leaving the magazine at her feet
she moves to nehru and suhrawardy as azad ushers them into the canopied area
abdul ghaffar khan sits quietly in the background
mirabehn speaks softly
his pulse is very irregular the kidneys arent functioning
nehru looks across at gandhi
the doctor who is testing gandhis pulse yet again glances at him no encouragement and moves away
nehru moves to the side of the cot and gandhi smiles weakly and holds out a hand but he is in pain
bapu i have brought mr
it was he who called on the muslims to rise he is telling them now to go back to their homes to lay down their arms
gandhi looks up at suhrawardy who nods
gandhi looks back at nehru
there is no hint of him changing his mind
personally think what you can do by living that you cannot do by dying
gandhi smiles whimsically he touches him again but there is no change in his attitude
pleadingly what do you want
a moment that the fighting will stop that you make me believe it will never start again
nehru looks at him hopelessly
a huge crowd some smoke in distant buildings some damage near to help us know this is still calcutta and all is not yet at peace
the camera sweeps over the crowd past the loudspeakers on their poles
we see surly knots of belligerent rowdies mostly young but not all hanging on the fringes as we move over the heads of the mass of listening people to a
platform where nehru speaks
azad suhrawardy and others sit on the floor behind him
we have heard his voice over all this
sometimes it is when you are quite without hope and in utter darkness that god comes to the rescue
gandhiji is dying because of our madness
put away your revenge
what will be gained by more killing
have the courage to do what you know is right
for gods sake let us embrace like brothers
featuring the muslim leader suhrawardy leaning against a wall watching an action out of shot with evident tension
we hear a little clank of metal
there are five men facing gandhi
they wear black trousers and black knit vests
there are thongs around their arms that make their bulging muscles seem even more powerful
they are hindu thugs goondas
their clothes are dirty and they are too but they are laying knives and guns at gandhis feet
mirabehn azad pyarelal the doctor and others on the roof watch fascinated a little frightened
it is our promise
it is a promise
gandhi is looking at him testing not giving or accepting anything that is mere gesture
go try god by with you
the goondas stand
they glance at suhrawardy he smiles tautly and they start to leave but one nahari lingers
suddenly he moves violently toward gandhi taking a flat piece of indian bread chapati from his trousers and tossing it forcefully on gandhi
mirabehn and azad start to move toward him the man looks immensely strong and immensely unstable
but gandhi holds up a shaking hand stopping them
naharis face is knotted in emotion half anger half almost a childs fear but there is a wild menace in that instability
i am going to hell but not with your death on my soul
only god decides who goes to hell
stiffening aggressive i i killed a child
then an anguished defiance i smashed his head against a wall
gandhi stares at him breathless
in a fearful whisper why
it is as though the man has told him of some terrible self inflicted wound
tears now and wrath they killed my son my boy
almost reflexively he holds his hand out to indicate the height of his son
he glares at suhrawardy and then back at gandhi
the muslims killed my son
they killed him
he is sobbing but in his anger it seems almost as though he means to kill gandhi in retaliation
a long moment as gandhi meets his pain and wrath
then i know a way out of hell
nahari sneers but there is just a flicker of desperate curiosity
find a child a child whose mother and father have been killed
a little boy about this high
he raises his hand to the height nahari has indicated as his sons
and raise him as your own
nahari has listened
his face almost cracks it is a chink of light but it does not illumine his darkness
only be sure
that he is a muslim
and that you raise him as one
and now the light falls on nahari
his face stiffens he swallows fighting any show of emotion then he turns to go
but he takes only a step and he turns back going to his knees the sobs breaking again and again from his heaving body as he holds his head to
gandhis feet in the traditional greeting of hindu son to hindu father
a second and gandhi reaches out and touches the top of his head
the goondas watch
finally gently exhaustedly go go
god bless you
trucks with riot squads shields and truncheons in place but they are lounging waiting
there is silence and air of somnolence
some of the riot squad lounge in little groups around the courtyard
a distant cough
featuring a senior riot squad officer dressed and ready for action
he it is who coughed
he coughs again clearing his throat
a police sergeant stands by him both are reading the front page of a paper the senior riot squad officer holds
we see two huge lines of headline gandhi near death nehru in one of the trucks one of the men offers another a cigarette
a telephone rings sharply inside
the senior riot squad officer and the sergeant run in as engines start the men run to their places lower visors headlights go on
a constable mans the telephone
he listens as the senior riot squad officer and the sergeant run to him tensely
the sound of the great doors opening in the courtyard more engines revving up
yes sir yes sir he holds up his hand to the senior officer wait
he glances up at the senior riot squad officer
writing from the phone accident christie crossroads a lorry and a rickshaw
yes sir i have it
he shrugs at the senior riot squad officer and hands the information slip to another constable behind the desk
the sergeant sighs and moves to the outside door
we hear him bellow stand down
the constable hangs up and sighs heavily
the senior riot squad officer shakes his head and turns and walks slowly to the door
the senior riot squad officer and the sergeant stand in the doorway as the engines die
the men relax
the silence returns
a dog barks distantly disturbed by the noise
a bird caws once or twice
i wouldnt have believed it mr
sergeant its a bloody miracle
it lies in silence
mirabehn is bent over gandhi
he is curled almost in the fetal position his face looking wan and sunken
for the first time there is silence no explosions no distant shouts no gunfire
bapu theres been no fighting anywhere
it has stopped the madness has stopped
we see the police commissioner suhrawardy two doctors abdul ghaffar khan and some others
nearer gandhi behind mirabehn are nehru patel azad and pyarelal
gandhi turns to mirabehn his face shaking peering into her eyes
it is foolish if it is just to save the life of an old man
in every temple and mosque they have pledged to die before they lift a hand against each other
his weary eyes look at her he looks up slowly to azad
azad nods its true
then patel everywhere
gandhi looks at nehru
nehru just nods tautly
gandhi looks down then lifts his head to azad
maulana my friend could i have some orange juice
then you and i will take a piece of bread together
the relief brings water to their eyes and grins to their faces
nehru bends to gandhi
gandhi holds his hand out to him and nehru clutches it
then you see bapu it is not difficult
i have fasted only a few hours and i accomplished what you could not do in as many days
it is a joke in their way with each other and gandhis eyes light his smile comes
but it is tired
he puts his other hand over nehrus and nehru lowers his head to it crying silently
as in the opening sequence but a few minutes earlier
the crowd is beginning to gather for the evening prayers
we see a tonga or two a gardener opening the gate to the garden three policemen standing talking idly among themselves
gandhi is eating muli he holds his head back to capture the lemon juice
we hear the click of a camera that is how you eat muli
manu hands him a cloth and he wipes his hands
another click of a camera
he is not fully recovered but well on the way
to the photographer im not sure i want to be remembered that way
it is all light and for fun
we get a wide angle shot now and see that bourke white is shooting one of her favorite subjects again
she is enjoying the banter as is mirabehn who is spinning quietly to one side of the room and patel who sits cross legged like gandhi on the floor
pyarelal is working on papers with him but grins at this
dont worry with luck you may not be
and she shoots him again as he hands the cloth back to manu
abha is sitting next to manu looking at a collection of pictures of gandhi obviously bourke whites
no hell be remembered for tempting fate
it is wry but waspishly chiding
abha suddenly holds a picture up for gandhi to see
its one of him ears wide eyes round
gandhi taps her on the head with his finger as she smiles
but bourke white has looked from patel to gandhi clearly shaken by the implication in patels words
you really are going to pakistan then
gandhi shrugs and she chides too you are a stubborn man
a grin in the mood of their flirtation im simply going to prove to muslims there and hindus here that the only devils in the world are those running around
in our own hearts and thats where all our battles ought to be fought
abha has signaled to the cheap watch dangling from his dhoti
he glances at it and holds his arms out
the two girls help him
and what kind of a warrior have you been in that warfare
she is photographing his getting up and leaning on the two girls
not a very good one
thats why i have so much tolerance for the other scoundrels of the world
he moves off but has a sudden thought and turns to patel
ask panditji to to consider what weve discussed
patel nods soberly and gandhi starts for the door bourke white moving with him
of the photographs enough
a plea one more
he has passed her hes in the doorway
we see the crowd at the end of the garden where the light of the day is beginning to soften
he turns teasing in his slightly flirtatious way with women
youre a temptress
she shoots him against the door the crowd milling distantly waiting then she lowers her camera
just an admirer
nothings more dangerous especially for an old man
he turns the last words have betrayed the smile on his face they have a painful sense of truth about them
bourke white watches as he moves into the garden toward the crowd in the distance
she turns to mirabehn
theres a sadness in him
its an observation and a question
mirabehn accedes gravely
he thinks hes failed
bourke white stares at her then turns to look out at him
my god if anythings proved him right its whats happened these last months
mirabehn nods but she keeps on spinning and tries to sound cynically resigned but her innate emotionalism keeps breaking through in her voice and on her face
i am blinded by my love of him but i think when we most needed it he offered the world a way out of madness
but he doesnt see it
and neither does the world
it is laced with pain
bourke white turns and looks out at gandhi so tiny so weak as he walks between his props
he has now reached the end of the garden and is moving among the crowd assembled there
gandhi is moving forward in the crowd one hand resting on manu the other on abha
he makes the pranam to someone the crowd is bowing to him some speaking and we also see the crowd from his point of view bapu god bless you thank
you thank you
he turns to a very old woman who makes a salaam to him
gandhi touches her head
allah be with you
smiling he turns back
a jostling the sound of beads falling
to someone brother bapu is already late for prayers
gandhi turns to the person he makes the pranam
godse is making the pranam to him and he suddenly wildly draws his gun and fires
the camera closes on gandhi as he staggers and falls the red stain of blood seeping through his white shawl
manu and abha bend over him silent in their first shock
the sound of panic and alarm begins to grow around them they suddenly scream and begin to cry
a moment we sense the blackness moving like dark smoke
the camera is pulling back very slowly and we can tell the blackness is smoke rising from a fire
and now we see that it is a funeral pyre
and all around that pyre a mass of silent humanity
through the smoke sitting cross legged near the rim of the flames we see nehru
and azad and patel mirabehn and kallenbach the drawn faces of lord and lady mountbatten manu and abha
a helicopter shot coming slowly up the wide river low toward a barge and a mass of people in the distance
and now we are over the barge and it is covered with flowers
flowers flow downstream around it
an urn sits on it containing gandhis ashes and nehru stands near it azad and patel a little behind him
and as the barge floats down the river nehru bends and lifts the urn
he swallows restraining his own emotion and slowly ritualistically sprinkles the ashes over the water
and as they spread we hold on that stretch of the river the flowers swirling languidly around it as the dark timeless current moves them toward the sea
weak struggling as he spoke the words to mirabehn there have been tyrants and murderers and for a time they can seem invincible
but in the end they always fall
think of it always
when you are in doubt that that is gods way the way the world is meant to be
think of that
and slowly the camera begins pulling back leaving the flowers the brown rolling current as though leaving the story of gandhi going far out away from the great river reaching
higher and higher through streaks of clouds as end titles begin
and through them once more we hear dimly reminiscently through the rushing wind at home children are writing essays about him
the croaky voice singing god save our gracious king
dyer sergeant major the sergeant major take aim
the sound of massed rifle fire screams
you are my best friend
my highest guru and my sovereign lord
who the hell is he
i dont know sir
my name is gandhi
the sound of rioting womens screams terror
find a child a child whose mother and father have been killed
a little boy
about this high
he thinks hes failed
long live mahatma gandhi
long live mahatma gandhi
