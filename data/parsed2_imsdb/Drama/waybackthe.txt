written by peter weir inspired by the book the long walk by slavomir rawicz shooting draft sofia january a slow steady downward view
the camera seemingly floats as the curve of the globe passes beneath
beginning in the green jungles of sikkim in northern india it crosses the himalayas down into tibet and beyond to china the zigzag line of the great wall clearly visible
then the gobi desert is flowing beneath and as the light begins to fade mongolia gives way to the russian steppe and as dusk turns to night we are over
siberia gliding north over lake baikal and onward across forested hills and valleys
a sense of utter remoteness in this silent landscape
then a tiny shaved patch within the primeval forest a bald rectangle of ground crisscrossed by faint probing lights
the camera slows and hovers
out of the blackness the momentary glimpse of a barbed wire fence lit by the combing fingers of a searchlight
another angle and the silhouette of distant timber buildings is briefly etched before the light passes and all is again in darkness
closer on a canvas sided barrack building ghostly shadows projected on the wall
a long rectangular building the walls lined with two tiered bunks of rough hewn logs
in the centre a metal stove with a chimney stretching out through the roof
a dim central bulb illuminates some men aged from to most sitting or lying on their bunks
some wear scraps of army uniform or civilian clothing others in prison issued padded jackets
some from the asian territories still ear something of their national costume
included among them are groups of foreigners from recently occupied countries and a babel of languages drifts through the fetid air
its a wide ranging mix of types of race of class
theyre miserable starving and ill
there is no camp camaraderie and they eye each other with indifference or suspicion
most of these men are political prisoners known as politicals or s ers after the section of the soviet penal code that has put them here
near the stove and contrasted with the politicals a group are gathered about a card game on a lower bunk
these men look healthier and are further distinguished by their tattoos
these are the urki some dozen of them regular criminals and from their manner the undisputed masters of the block
sitting facing each other valka thirties heavily tattooed flash of a steel caped tooth
his opponent bohdan older and the pakhan the boss of this criminal gang
bohdan shuffles a deck of home made cards
all dialogue in the camp is in russian sub titled whatve you got
valka removes his coat passes it to bohdan who examines it briefly
think i want your stinking lice farm
he shows the label
good as new
bohdan nods to his minder who opens a battered wooden suitcase a glimpse of hoarded food
the minder puts his hand on a lump of bread lying beside a length of sausage
the bread is placed beside the coat
and the sausage
bohdan stares at him shakes his head no
bohdan youre a dogs prick i swear
i hope you die with an axe in your skull and your balls ripped out
the swearing is more or less a ritual and provokes no reaction
for the bread
bohdan shuffles and deals
he separates his cards with the long fingernail of his little finger
in a few rapid plays valka is left coat less
apart from the half dozen thugs surrounding the players the game is watched by two politicals who have just entered with a load of wood for the stove
the elder smith a hard face man in his late forties the other andrei early twenties
valka signals to yuri who takes three tailor made cigarettes from his pocket passes them carefully to valka who lays them before bohdan
for the bread
for the bread and the sausage bastard
bohdan enjoying himself
throw in that crappy shirt youre wearing and i might be tempted
smiles from the gang
valka knows hes being mocked but hes desperate
his eyes flick down to the sausage
then he takes off his shirt
he sits bare chested a tattooed portrait of lenin on his left breast looking across at stalin on his right
bohdan deals and again valka loses
valkas mate yuri places a padded prison jacket over his bony shoulders which he shrugs off irritably then offers to bohdan
i dont play for regulation issue crap
valka lights a cigarette
all done valka
valka tries to conceal his mounting tension behind a veil of cool
i go on credit
valka nervously fingers an aluminium crucifix hanging by a cord from his neck
etched on the cross a naked woman
youre already in debt
valkas anxious eyes
they settle on smith by the stove
he speaks in carefully articulated english
smith returns the stare then slowly approaches
take off your coat
a silence the criminal gang sensing a showdown
theres something about smith something steely unpredictable
the fire crackles loudly
smith all the while holding valkas stare
he looks at smiths companion
andrei goes pale removes his coat to reveal a decent looking patterned wool sweater
he offers the coat
lets have the sweater
take the coat
i want the sweater
andrei doesnt move
your babushka make it for you
come on hand it over
andrei is visibly shaking
you have no authority here
valka gets up moves slowly to andrei a smile on his lips
then he casually reaches down as if to tuck his trousers deeper into his boots reaches for something and in one slow balletic movement swings up and stretches out his
hand to andrei and andrei sobs and leans to one side
was that really necessary
in the dim light andreis face is grey as he sags to the floor
none of the other prisoners move to help him nor do they show any sign of concern as valka places the knife back in his boot and returns to the
yuri steps forward and strips the sweater from the dead man handing it on to valka who passes it to bohdan
bohdan examines it professionally wipes a little blood off his hands
for the sausage
the game resumes
freshly dug graves
close on one of these stones piled in a mound over the grave
hands into frame moving aside the stones
wider to see two prisoners breath steaming from their mouths as they work quickly and quietly to uncover the grave
the older of the two is khabarov late thirties the other lazar late twenties
furtive looks over their shoulders as an occasional blade of light from the watchtower throws them into silhouette
here he is
he reaches out to touch a human toe poking out of the rocks
as they work close on the face of andrei as they continue to uncover his body
hes not frozen yet thats lucky
the remaining stones are removed to find the corpse dressed in nothing but underwear
keep your voice down be grateful theres anything left
they reach into the grave to retrieve the underwear
lazars hands in water some kind of tin sink water running red as the underwear is rinsed clean of blood
a soviet guard beats a hammer against a hanging length of iron
close on the barrack stove the underwear drying khabarovs hands into the frame
as the prisoners rise follow a hand to hand exchange of the set of underwear for a hank of tobacco
khabarov having done the deal splits the tobacco with lazar
moving quickly to complete a second deal khabarov swaps half his share of the tobacco with another prisoner for two slices of bread
he waits until the last of the men leave then he carefully breaks off a corner from one piece of bread concealing the rest in a hiding place in the
dirt at the base of his bunk a glimpse of a cache of hoarded food and other items
the saved morsel he places on his tongue and closes his eyes
he doesnt chew just lets it dissolve like the eucharist
then its gone in a slow swallow and he opens his eyes
he can hear a guard shouting outside but he hesitates carefully licking his fingers
he stares at his hand
close on a spot between his fingers theres a crumb there
into frame the tip of his tongue as it slowly and carefully retrieves the tiny speck of bread
the camp seen in a distant view surrounded by double wire a collection of weathered timber buildings with watchtowers placed at regular intervals along the perimeter
in the distance dense forest
entering frame a column of close to a hundred men march toward the camp
following behind is a lorry carrying six guards supplies for their recent journey and a camp stove
as they approach one of the prisoners looks up to an arch stretching across the gates a hand painted sign in russian subtitled labor is honor glory nobility and the
prisoner is janusz early twenties and he exchanges a look with the man beside him tomasz about the same age
another angle shows a line of prisoners five abreast marching toward them on their way to work
they have their attendant guards and dogs and as the two columns pass each other the contrast between the half starved ill looking old prisoners and the comparative health of
the new could not be more apparent is this what we are to become
on the faces of the new
we glimpse some of those already established they include bohdan and valka and further back smith and khabarov
as they pass they look across to janusz and tomasz both polish and behind them to voss a tall young latvian with a mop of white blonde hair
behind voss zoran a blanket over his three piece suit
beside him another pole kazik at seventeen the youngest in the group
the newly arrived prisoners assemble between the various buildings an area known as the zone
the camp is being expanded and everywhere are piles of cut timber coils of wire and work going on replacing old canvas sided barracks with new timber ones
the spring thaw has turned recently melted snow into slush and duck boards are hastily laid to allow the commandant to cross to the assembled prisoners
he walks with his subordinate and lazar who is foreman of the new camp construction
lazar carries a sheaf of plans and the commandant stops studies a drawing then impatiently issues an order dismissing him
the commandant mounts a box accepting a folder of documents from his subordinate who has in turn received them from the escorting guard
the commandant surveys the prisoners before him
hes a man in his fifties with a bland but not unintelligent cast to his features
he looks up from the collection of documents in his hand
enemies of the people
look about you
it is not our guns or our dogs or our wire that forms your prison
siberia is your prison
all four million square miles of it
here in camp you will work hard
work and you eat
eat and you live
close on janusz and his friends
later the newly arrived prisoners exit the wash house heads and beards shaved
in the background a glimpse of others waiting their turn
to one side of the wash house a pile of their luggage
a couple of guards sort through their belongings pocketing the odd item
janusz voss and kazik heads shaved exit the hut
januszs attention is caught by the men working on replacing the old stockade wall with a new double barbed wire fence
the overseer lazar gives a signal and a section of the old wall falls to the ground
the prisoners move in a line toward an open window in the side of the kitchen building
here under the watchful eye of the cook one of bodhans men a single serve of thin soup is slopped into their metal bowls
one has no bowl so he uses his hat
janusz and his friends shuffle toward the window
their attention is caught by a group of blind prisoners feeling their way along the side of the kitchen hut a hand on the shoulder of the man in front
saw it in the transit camp
smith a couple of places ahead in the line turns on hearing english spoken
as janusz moves forward he watches several wild eyed men scrambling about in a pile of kitchen slops thrown into the mud by the kitchen door
they find here the odd scrap of food or simply soak their fingers in the slime then lick them clean
smith having been served moves away retrieving a hoarded slice of bread from within his jacket
he dips it into the soup raises it to his mouth when a corner of the bread drops to the ground
one of the garbage eaters dives for it but smith is too quick for him placing a boot over the scrap of bread
janusz watches as smith picks up the bread cleans off the dirt and eats it his every move watched by the starving man at his feet
janusz offers the remainder of his soup to the man who greedily drinks it
smith and janusz stare at each other
planning to survive on half rations son
janusz surprised by the american accented english
hes an old man
im an old man
but ill be alive in the morning
he goes to move away hesitates turns back to janusz
that can kill you here
youll learn that
he places the last morsel of bread in his mouth and chewing slowly turns and walks away
janusz turns to find khabarov beside him looking at smiths retreating back
he looks back to smith walking away toward the barracks
stalin doesnt like foreigners
that includes poles
you are polish arent you
janusz still staring after smith
yes i am
i love you poles your burning sense of injustice your yearning for freedom
he offers his hand
janusz looks at him he wears a distinctive coat trimmed with fur something refined about him aristocratic even
he offers his hand and they shake
and your prayer may i ask
thats what they told me
khabarov indicates himself
sabotage ten years
they begin walking toward the distant barrack buildings
and you were in the cavalry
januszs suspicions aroused
how could you know that
oh theres that polish spirit
i observe things your demeanor your may i say certain swagger
cavalryman thats how id cast you
he leans forward whispers
weve been waiting for you
poor poland hitler invades from the west
days later stalin from the east
janusz relaxes smiles
how could we know russia would stab us in the back
and you were on the soviet side of the line and they arrest you and thousands like you
accuse you of spying and they torture you
you signed a confession
i wouldnt sign so they tortured someone else
usual tactics they torture a close friend who names you as a spy a neighbor
your old school teacher
khabarov looks into januszs eyes a pain beyond speaking
khabarov tactfully changes the subject
i was an actor moving pictures
in my last picture i played an aristocrat
they arrested me after the films release
it was claimed i was elevating the status of the old nobility
you got ten years for a performance in a film
ive had better notices
and they enter their hut
the men sitting or lying on their bunks a little conversation here and there but most have withdrawn into themselves just glad to have survived another day
janusz looks about him khabarov still by his side
januszs attention is caught by the tattooed group playing cards by the stove
valka is playing bohdan again his losing streak continuing
khabarov speaks just above a whisper
who are they
professional criminals your ordinary run of the mill murderers and thieves dont stare at them
the guards let them run things in here
they are to be feared
why would they let them run things
they are considered the by product of bourgeoisie society and therefore friends of the people
we political prisoners are enemies of the people
russia has become one vast prison slave labor
you see even this camp is expanding to take in another thousand prisoners
janusz looks over to a group of asiatic prisoners
from the far reaches of the soviet empire all scooped up in the net like so many minnows poor creatures
and do any ever wriggle out of the net
khabarov considers a moment then leads him away from the surrounding prisoners
he lowers his voice to a whisper
you should be more careful
stalin has eyes and ears everywhere even in here
he leans closer to janusz
in a camp like this youll be dead in a year
if not literally then in spirit
and how long have you been here
eleven months and twenty nine days
khabarov offers his hand
good night friend
in bone chilling cold the prisoners form up in their brigades as a guard begins counting them
janusz looks toward a barrack building where the bodies of several men who died overnight are being carried out and laid on the ground among them the garbage eater from
the night before
janusz glances over toward smith who stares impassively ahead
is visible checking paper work at the camp gates
follow a bird as it hops from branch to branch pausing every now and then to listen to the sounds of axes and saws drifting from the forest floor
janusz and his friends voss tomasz kazik and zoran work at trimming felled trees of branches and then sawing them into lengths
smith and his gang work nearby
he watches janusz peeling strips of bark from a pine tree and stuffing them in his pocket
khabarov too works here with a third gang cutting and trimming the trees
on the valley floor below towering cliffs some men haul rocks in wooden wheelbarrows from the mine entrance across a maze of tracks to waiting trucks
a fire blazes in a gallon drum set up in an open sided wooden shelter
here bohdan and his criminal associates supervise the work
valka has fallen on a slippery slope within the urka hierarchy following his losses and growing debt
bohdan amuses himself by throwing stones at valka warning him away from the fire like a stray dog
guards placed at vantage points stamp their feet to keep warm occasionally shouting at the exhausted prisoners to work harder or move faster
death is casual here
a man falls
if found to be dead he is left where he fell bodies to be collected and counted at the end of the day
janusz and his group dump a load of trimmed logs in a bay by the mine entrance
he hesitates as the others move away staring into the black hole leading into the mountain
eerie sounds drift up from deep below
a look of utter dread on his face
the prisoners work hard to fill their quotas voss swings his axe like a demon but even with his contribution the cut pile of logs is a long way from
the mark showing at the top of the storage bay
bohdan the overseer moves amongst the various working gangs measuring their completed piles of logs
januszs group are still only half way to a full quota
khabarov leaves his gang and approaches janusz
quickly now half quota means half rations
quota is law here
no one could meet that quota even if they were fed and rested
khabarov calls for them to follow him
he leads them at a jog deeper into the trees pointing out various shapes buried in fallen leaves and drifts of snow
he clears away the leaves and snow to reveal a pile of old grey cut timber
cut last year and never collected
quickly hide them inside your fresh cut timber
bohdan moving closer
it becomes a race to transport all the old logs to their pile and to conceal them inside the fresh cut logs
they just make it but bohdan notices the end of an old grey log poking out from the center of the stack
he stops his measuring of their quota
a tense moment then he nods and leaves
khabarov crosses from his gang to join them
he knows but he doesnt care as long as his arse is protected
this is tufta
janusz nods his thanks
the long march back to camp
janusz peers left and right toward the beckoning forest
beside him zoran senses his friend might just take off then and there
he places a restraining hand on his arm as a guards voice drifts through the still air a step to the left a step to the right and i shoot
voss and kazik are by the stove unwinding their long foot cloths that most wear in place of socks
kazik hangs the damp cloths on the stove to dry and sets out to examine his toes which are in poor shape suffering the early stages of frostbite
tomasz sits nearby sketching the scene on a sheet of birch bark using a piece of charcoal
wider to see valka looking on in admiration
tomasz is uneasy despite the implied compliment
valka hands him a sheet of paper and the stub of a pencil
you do for me
you want me to make a sketch of you
bohdan lies on his bunk surrounded by several of his tattooed henchmen listening to a story
the storyteller looking rather uncomfortable is zoran
his russian is good but for a moment his memory fails him as he desperately tries to recall the next beat in the story
keep going and youll get some bread so how does this long john silver find the treasure
i knew a type like that
he had one leg
then to zoran go on
the story resumes zoran giving it all hes got when valka appears a sketch in his hand
he passes it to bohdan
close on the sketch a lusty naked woman
valka makes a gesture implying masturbation
bohdan examines the drawing before licking the back of it lifting his shirt sticking it to his chest then lowering his shirt again
he waves valka away
close on a shirt
the shirt lies on januszs bunk and its moving
a tiny subtle movement but just perceptible the movement caused by hundreds of lice
to see this is januszs view khabarov there too watching over his shoulder
for the lice i have an old folk remedy
he picks up the shirt and walks toward the door of the barrack indicating janusz should follow
as he passes his bunk he scoops up his own shirt
khabarov leads him toward the wire
from somewhere deep in the bowels of the earth a low sinister rumbling the very ground itself shaking momentarily
janusz stops while khabarov keeps walking
they blast at night
he pauses to let janusz catch up then looking furtively about him he crouches by a drift of snow
janusz hands him his shirt
he scrapes a hole in the snow buries the shirt leaving only the tip showing
he does the same with his own shirt
were going to leave them here overnight
janusz stares up at the wire then to a distant watchtower its searchlight briefly illuminating him
khabarov follows his eye line
it can be done
janusz holding his breath
there is a way through the wire
janusz stares at him
lazar youve seen him my associate overseer of construction
he nods toward an area where stockade wall is being replaced with double wire
few ever escape the camps
ive waited for someone like you someone with the strength and will to see it through
cant go west apart from the soviets theres the germans
all soviet right to the pacific
it would have to be south
khabarov nods beams at him like a teacher with a very bright pupil
they marched as due north from the railway i glimpsed a lake but i have no idea where we are
khabarov squats down janusz joins him and smoothing out a drift of snow khabarov sketches a map of a lake and indicates the location of the camp
we believe about kilometers north of lake baikal
we could follow the edge of the lake it runs due south
then on to the trans siberian railway
cross that and youre close to the mongolian border
januszs eyes burn with excitement
khabarov takes his arm as if drawing energy from the younger man
spring is already upon us
it would have to be next autumn
its kilometers to the border maybe more
we need careful planning stock pile food
ive already begun trading dealing
you could do the same
in the autumn the weather is predictable
we need the early snows to cover our tracks
what about my friends
if you trust them
but they wont all survive
but theyd die free men
khabarov offers his hand and they shake
khabarov and janusz enter having buried the shirt in the snow
khabarov indicates lazar sitting on a bunk and whispers
he was architect
now he is grave robber me too
whispers we sneak out at night
through the wire
he moves away
to the echoing clang of the hammer and iron janusz and khabarov hurry to where they buried their clothing
revised yellow a
close on the tips of the cloth showing above the snow a teeming mound of lice on each
wider as they shake their clothing free of the lice and hurry over to join the assembly of prisoners at the kitchen servery window for their meagre breakfast ration
at the same time the morning ritual of carrying out the bodies of those who have died overnight is underway
the corpses are stacked like cords of wood for burial
janusz pauses a muttered prayer on his lips
then hes passing the hospital barracks the usual crowd of desperately ill prisoners hoping to be admitted to be excused another day of the killing work the majority turned away
he joins the line at the kitchen
the days bread ration is being weighed and issued
if not exactly grams a little is added or subtracted the cook keeping trimmed slices placing them in a tin
having been counted once inside the camp the brigade of prisoners is marched outside the gates where the armed guards who will escort them to work are waiting
begins counting them again
its much colder than usual prisoners beating their arms to keep warm a high wind blowing
khabarov stands with janusz
temperature is dropping
below theyre not supposed to send us out
know how to tell the temperature
you see frosty fog its below
if you exhale easily but in a rasping fashion
when your spit freezes
more than below
he hoiks and spits
close on the ball of spit mid air
its a solid glittering crystal of ice
the freezing wind has picked up considerably driving sleet against the column of prisoners forcing them to a halt in an open snow covered area
the column halts the guards anxiously confer to go back or continue on
the prisoners shiver in the biting cold some collapse their fellow prisoners unwilling or unable to help them
janusz and his friends find themselves near smith and watch as he hails a guard
shouts in russian we need to make shelter
who asked you
well freeze to death in less than an hour
i couldnt give a fuck if you drop dead right now
yes but lose men and youll have some forms to fill out
could go badly for you
the guard dimly considers this
the prisoners begin to stir some shouting out that they should turn back
the guard alarmed orders the prisoners to the ground other guards level their rifles as the mass of men lay down on the freezing ground
all but smith
we could move into the forest find shelter
the guard is about to leave when to his astonishment and that of the other prisoners smith begins to walk toward the forest edging the road
the guard draws his pistol
on the ground zoran lies beside janusz as they watch the unfolding drama
shouts for smith to return others raise their rifles waiting for his order to fire
he is conflicted and after a tense moment gestures for them to lower their weapons
let the prisoners take shelter in the trees
shoot anyone who makes a run for it
janusz stares after smith admiring of his reckless courage
the men work frantically collecting fallen timber
smith watches as voss picks up a massive log places it on his shoulder and carries it to where janusz is supervising the building of their shelter
most of the other prisoners have just piled snow up around bundles of sticks to make windbreaks but janusz is building something more elaborate
smiths eyes miss nothing as he notes januszs skill and the way the others work as a team under his direction
some distance away valka huddles alone against the trunk of a tree
he too is watching janusz organize shelter for the group
janusz calls khabarov to join them but he declines politely
he moves on to find smith invites him back to their improvised shelter
as smith sits zoran offers his hand
you are brave man dragan zoran yugoslav this is janusz wieszczek the youngster is kazik both polish
they nod to smith andrejs voss latvian
its a league of nations
english our common language
your first name
as the blizzard grows in intensity janusz reaches into his pocket for strips of pine bark collected earlier
he hands them out to his companions
they watch as he chews on the bark
the others follow his example
watching from a short distance away is guard no
he takes note of the group as future troublemakers
the men are stirring struggling up to face another day when the door opens and in a flurry of snow guard no
enters with another soldier
he orders smith janusz and his group to fall out
as he passes smith you dont like being out in the cold do you cowboy
and as he moves away smith mutters to janusz
might as well have shot us yesterday
janusz and the others look at him
were for the mine
a labyrinth of twisting tunnels leading down into the frozen earth
dim lights silhouette ghostly figures working with pick and shovel
occasionally the muffled sound of a distant explosion as a gallery is blasted yet deeper
mingling with these eerie sounds something more sinister the hacking coughs of those whove done the most time in this frozen hell
the man working beside janusz wields a pick janusz shovelling out the rock as it breaks up
the man pauses to light a smoke
his fingers have moulded themselves into the shape of his pick handle they are like hooks the man unable to straighten his fingers
he holds the cigarette with the tips of his fingers as if his hand was an artificial limb
janusz looks around desperately fighting off an overwhelming feeling of claustrophobia
despite the cold sweat beads on his forehead
kazik and a man known as the prof drag a cart laden with rock up a steep incline
they wear horse collars attached to the cart by leather harnesses
the profs wasted frame and sallow complexion are in contrast to his lively intelligent eyes
he says something to kazik in russian
he shakes his head
he doesnt speak russian
the prof tries german then english
they share a smile
i was only saying these collars the same used by ancient egyptian people
yes but on their horses probably
how do you know that
i was professor of egyptology
kazik manages a look at his companion before putting even more effort into dragging the load
a man enveloped in clouds of white steam points a long pipe at the frozen rock and gravel the heat making it easier for the pick and shovel men to
this is the point man and he opens and shuts valves on the pipe stem which regulates the hot steam that travels along pipes leading back to a primitive boiler
men try to warm themselves by working near the point man and when the guards are not around they clutch the pipes in their hands gaining a few moments of
smith knows how to work the system and has found a spot here working beside the point man
he looks across to see janusz staggering up the slope toward the distant mine entrance where a guard can be seen silhouetted against the light
he watches a moment something not right about janusz
he lays his shovel aside and hurries after him
janusz scrambling toward the surface
he stumbles falls to his knees
he looks down sees something on the ground
something buried in the dirt and rubble paving stones
he clears away the debris to reveal a stone path
looking up he sees the path leads to a gate framed by a hedge
as he moves up the path to the gate
his unseen hand opens the gate
now the view is of the path as he walks forward a series of worn flagstones then the camera tilts up to see a closed front door
a pan to the left of the door to see a loose brick in the wall
close on janusz as smith is suddenly beside him grabbing his arm and swinging him into the darkness of an adjoining tunnel
are you crazy
theyll shoot you
got to get out
smith stares at him
hes delirious and begins to shake with cold
smith grabs his shoulder and drags him back to where the point man works thrusting januszs hands around the pipe
the point man waves them away but smith bribes him with a slice of bread
smith turns back to janusz the warmth of the pipe beginning to have its effect
it can be done
what can be done
he knows a way through the wire
smith slaps a hand over his mouth glancing at the point man before dragging janusz further away
he has a plan
his name is khabarov
now smith understands
you know him
he has no intention of escaping
been here foryears seeksout new arrivals mewhen ifirstcame here
he justlikes totalkabout escape
iveknown others like him
why should i believe you
shakes his head nothing is for nothing in the camps
from you he gets your energy your spirit
you feed his dream of escape
you help keep him alive
hes no more than a leech
youre a cold bastard mister
im still alive thats all i know
but i wont be in six months
and neither will you
not in the mines
so if youre serious about making a run for it im in
i thought you were a loner
cant be done alone
besides you have a weakness that could be useful to me
and whats that
if anything happens to me im counting on you carrying me
janusz knows hes not joking
it is snowing heavily and after swallowing their soup janusz and his friends walk back to the barracks
kazik stumbles and is helped to his feet by voss
he limps on to the barrack a hand resting for support on voss shoulder
janusz is preoccupied and he hesitates at t he door turns and looks back
after a moment staring at the ground he hurries inside
janusz has a puzzled khabarov by the arm guiding him back to the door
he points to the ground close on footprints as they rapidly disappear under the heavy snowfall
khabarov looks from the footprints to janusz a horrified look on his face
its a passing storm
itll do itll cover our tracks
we need preparation detailed plans maps the timing will never be perfect they wont expect it now
but the distances
what about food
weve been trading the american is with us
he has food you have food
how long will that last
ive spent half my life in the woods and mountains
well live off the land
it cant be done
janusz shocked at the change in his friends demeanor the appalling realization that smith was right about him
he seizes his arm
how do we get through the wire
i dont know what youre talking about
your friend lazar he knows doesnt he
a look of fear crosses khabarovs face
someone behind janusz
valka a few paces away watching them
khabarov scuttles back inside the barracks
janusz hesitates a moment then follows
in the last minutes before lights out the would be escapees make discreet preparations
clothing and other items are traded for food and tobacco
the cook and bohdan are at the center of the camp black market and most of the trading is done with them
tomasz trades more pornographic sketches with bohdan while kazik tries to trade his scarf for a pair of boots his own being in poor shape
voss sits beside him and notices that kazik does not look directly at his shoes or the scarf but is doing everything by feel
as they move away voss whispers to him
you cant see can you
a look of panic crosses the boys face
dont leave me behind
promise me andrejs
i could keep a hand on your shoulder by night and in the day i can see just fine
i wont hold you up
please dont tell them
ill die here
janusz and smith sit in a darkened corner working on lazar
they want to know how to get through the wire
he is reluctant until smith produces a wristwatch from his boot
the strapless watch of good make settles the deal just as the light flickers and goes out plunging the barracks into darkness
several shots of the wind driven snow whipping about the buildings
the wooden building creaks and heaves like a ship at sea as the storm builds into a fully fledged blizzard
the sounds of the sleeping men the usual cries and groans hacking coughs all mix into the howl of the storm
close on the conspirators lying awake smith voss kazik tomasz and zoran
smith looks across to janusz catches his eye
a signal from janusz not yet
khabarov too is awake
he jumps at any unexpected sound checks his horde of food in the hiding place at the base of his bunk as if expecting at any moment to be attacked
he sees a shadow
someone moving about near him a look of terror on his face
janusz lies on his back listening to the storm
a movement beside him then a knife pressed against his throat
he grins steel capped teeth his cross dangling from his neck
janusz goes still
there are no secrets here
what do you want
the game goes against me
small debt lose fingers
big debt they take head
me big debt
but one thing i never gamble is my wolf
he removes the knife from januszs throat tilts the blade to show a wolfs head incised into the blade
in forest you need knife to survive
he leans in close to januszs ear
you need a knife and i need miracle to get me out of here
with a conjurers ease he spins the knife in his fingers and arches his eyebrows deal
heavy snow still falling as shadowy figures run toward the wire
shouted commands and the beam of a searchlight isolates them not the fugitives but a group of guards
theyve found a gap in the wire
a great yelping and baying as the dog handlers join them releasing the dogs into the gap then following them toward the distant forest
then seven fugitives now including valka weave in and out of the trees at a fast jog
snow whirls about them as gasping for breath they attempt to keep up with janusz
in the rear kazik holds onto voss rope belt occasionally stumbling but voss has him up and on his feet fast enough to keep up with the others
janusz pauses briefly every now and then to study the moss growing on the north side of tree trunks before plunging on southward
they top a rise to a clearing and pause to catch their breath
the snow continues to fall but janusz will allow no rest and moves off without a backward glance
janusz is out in front when smith stops resting his hands on his knees gulping for air
the others stop too valka dropping to his knees
janusz runs back to valka drags him to his feet
or we die right now
you know how fast dogs travel
he turns to the others
run damn you
he moves to smith
is it time for me to carry you
smith waves him away gets up and continues
a feeble light penetrates the forest as day begins
the snow still falling heavily as the men stumble into a deep depression and facing a steep climb find they can go no further
kazik turns his face to the light
his sight is returning with the day and he nods gratefully to voss
in the deep stillness the sound of distant voices
they look about them
hard to tell the direction of the sound
janusz is on his feet theres plenty of fallen timber but no obvious place to hide
he draws a circle in the snow mimes digging to the others then turns to valka whispers
valka has never taken an order from a political in his short life
with a glance to the others he reluctantly draws his knife from his boot and passes it to janusz
while the group furiously dig janusz collects and trims fallen timber
as the hole deepens janusz begins to make a trellis roof
the voices change direction
they go still
are they surrounded
they resume their digging with greater intensity the hole now more than a meter at its deepest janusz placing the branches to cover their hide
several angles on the forest
light snow falling
camera moves slowly toward their hide wisps of vapor rise from below the surface
the russian voices are closer now
its like an indian sweat lodge as the fugitives sit shoulder to shoulder in a tight circle ears straining sweat running down their faces
the voices closer still
a tense moment and then they are passing the voices fading into silence
the strong wind drives snow and sleet horizontally and as they push forward they cover their faces to keep the snow from throat and lungs
valka his arm wrapped defensively across his eyes staggers and falls to his knees
janusz turns back drags him to his feet
kazik hangs onto the back of voss coat voss at times literally dragging him along
with valkas knife janusz cuts a square of bark pulls it from the tree cuts two triangular holes some centimeters apart then rams the base of the bark piece into
its a crude mask
the group all now wearing the improvised snow masks push forward against the wind looking like a tribe from some distant age dressed in ceremonial masks
janusz in the lead some fifty paces ahead but hes stopped thigh deep in the snow as still as a statue
the others catch up puzzled
smith calls to him lifts his mask
smith shakes him back to consciousness all the while the storm continues at full force
weve got to make fire
you saw how close they were
kazik sinks to the snow then zoran
we die either way might as well die warm
a hole scraped out of the snow and a wind break of fallen timber is all they can manage in their exhausted state
down in the hole janusz is striking a spark from a flint
some are fading fast kazik keeps falling asleep to be shaken awake by tomasz
smith is splitting wood into ever finer shavings ready to feed a nascent fire
still the damp kindling will not catch
they draw closer together for warmth draping their arms over each others shoulders
zorans head drops to his chest
tomasz shakes him
sleep and you die
tell us a story
the other look to zoran and fighting the desire to sleep he begins
valka loves a good story and despite their desperate situation he listens with the attention and concentration of a small child
once upon a time in the days of wooden ships there was a great storm in far away seas
a merchant ship hurried toward big rocks lightening in the sky the waves as high as house tops
very very cold brrr
the ship smashed onto the rocks the sailors cried in fear called out to god but they all drowned
all but one mr
he woke to find himself all alone on a desert island
for many years he lived without any human companions until one day he saw something shocking
what was it
a human footprint
he was no longer alone
but was the stranger friend or foe
another ship wrecked sailor
or a cannibal
all turn as a flicker of flame begins at the base of the kindling
while janusz blows at the flame mr
smith feeds in small shavings
the group watch with the awe and wonder usually reserved for child birth
then everyone is making a contribution adding a few leaves or tiny twigs like offerings as the fire grows and spreads
a comfortable blaze the group minus janusz sleep or drowse in the life giving warmth when a pile of snow lands on the fire
the others react
he heaps on more snow and the fire sputters out
by the time the others are on their feet janusz is almost out of sight and they hurry to catch up fearful of being left behind
ruins deep in the forest
from the overgrown rubble they build a shelter discovering as they do evidence that this was once a small remote soviet gulag
revised goldenrod a
later the fugitives sit shoulder to shoulder in a tight circle
they shiver in their padded jackets rub frozen limbs
valka looks up to find smith staring at him
you stare at me like the snake at the rabbit or is it the other way round
valka turns to the others with a silver toothed smile indicates smith
he teach me english
speak good huh
bread for words wasnt it cowboy
smith holds his gaze a moment before being distracted by a thumping sound outside
the group go very still
a second thump overhead this time
valka draws his knife
a trickle of snow falls through the vent in the roof
snow falling from trees
they relax a little
when can we travel by day
when i say
kazik glances at voss
how far have we come
twenty thirty kilometers
is that all
less if weve been going in circles like the chicken without its head
how can you tell were heading south
he reads the trees dont you
something like that
he spreads out a piece of cloth on the snow at his feet
alright lets see what youve got
no one moves
janusz reaches into his own pockets emptying the contents onto the cloth several slices of bread half a kilo of buckwheat some dried meat a swatch of tobacco
smith goes next with a larger store of bread and a little salt
voss has a collection of small fish heads which he adds to the store
tomasz kazik and zoran make their contributions
they stare grimly at their limited food supply
various other items are added a razor blade a length of cord a piece of barbed wire etc
smith picks up the barbed wire examines it
valka reluctantly reaches into his coat something familiar about it with its distinctive fur lined collar
thats khabarovs coat
he smiles at janusz as he produces a bulging sack from inside his coat
from the sack he produces khabarovs hoarded supply of food and other items
off januszs reaction he was going to inform
i talk to him
he puts the goods back in the sack and goes to place it inside his coat
janusz reaches out for the sack of food
valka glances at the others then passes it to him
tomasz has already begun to organize seven slices of bread laying one of vosss fish heads on each
he hands them out
they eat in silence savoring every bite
zoran removes the fish head passing it back to tomasz
then he places a thin layer of snow on the bread like a canape
he eats daintily his little finger extended like a dowager at a tea party raising a smile from his exhausted companions
the wind is rising whipping flurries of snow through the trees
smith and janusz are in the lead
smith refers back to valka
youve made a bargain with the devil
have you got a knife
they move on in silence janusz not liking his bargain any more than smith
smith finds himself walking beside valka
for direction he looks at grass and mosses whats that
i swear to god he better know what hes doing
you should be grateful youre here at all
gratitude is for dogs
he moves away from smith his eyes fixed on janusz who is again studying moss on the side of a tree
the group in the shelter of the trees
the sky is overcast but at least its not too cold
everywhere about is deep snow from the recent storm
tomasz prepares a meal from their dry rations small portions for men who have expended so much energy
kazik examines his swollen blistered feet
valka has his boots off shaking them
clean inside boots foot cloths
kazik copies him
man on run one tiny piece of sand can make cripple i swear to god
the others are listening and some do likewise
with lengths of wood as ski poles the group begin to make up lost time
voss has lashed his rope belt to kazik who walks behind him
smith wonders about this but says nothing
they pause at the top of a rise amongst the trees on hearing the sound of dogs howling from behind
wolves its only wolves
relieved they continue forward
only wolves great
from behind clouds the sun appears shafting light toward the earth
the upturned faces of the fugitives
sun worshipers all
janusz a short distance away
he plants his ski pole in the snow marking the tip of its shadow with a pine cone
they watch as he draws a line in the snow from the second marker about a foot in length
then he stands and with the toe of his left foot at the first pine cone and the toe of his right foot at the end of the line in
the snow he points calling to them
to lake baikal
cheers from the watching group
now we travel by day
they move off down toward a distant valley zoran the last to leave doubt on his face as he studies the series of seemingly endless forested hills stretching before them
the group push on with renewed energy
valka hurries to keep up with janusz
you are the pakhan
boss of criminals
were not criminals were escaping from criminals
i swear to god you win my respect with your sticks and pine cones
ill stand between you and death
you want to be my bodyguard
its the urka way
you have me and you have the wolf
he touches the knife in its bark sheath at his belt
janusz increases the pace valka pushing himself to keep up with his pakhan
the fugitives settle for the coming night
as tomasz unpacks their meagre food supply janusz sketches a map on a piece of birch bark
the other sit exhausted some close to sleep except smith who is working the piece of barbed wire from khabarovs stash
i have us here somewhere
above lake baikal their former camp is marked
south of the lake the trans siberian railway a little further south the russo mongolian border
with a twig he points to a spot seemingly not far from the prison camp
wider to see the disappointed faces of the group the distance yet to cover overwhelming
are you going all the way
i go further
the first smith has heard of this
tomasz turns from examining their store of food
we have food for another week
we need meat
i can make traps
well be moving too fast to wait for traps
we find farms villages get food there
theres a bounty on our heads
we steal it
they never know
were not thieves
then ill steal it and ill eat
you can watch
smith is working the length of barbed wire someone added earlier to their communal store
his fingers are bleeding as he struggles to separate the strands of wire
zoran puzzled but tomasz gets it
hes making a fish hook
janusz smiles at smiths ingenuity
its how well survive isnt it mister
i dont eat fish
then youll die
kazik has a far away look in his sight less eyes
he speaks in polish to janusz
what does he say
he asked janusz if he believes in gods forgiveness
this has come from seemingly nowhere
save your philosophy
concentrate on keeping up with us instead
he gets up and goes in search of more wood the others surprised at his cold tone
the rest of the group also begin to prepare their camp
most gather wood while tomasz the quartermaster makes their meal and janusz the fire
voss keeps an eye on kazik who demonstrating his independence while its still light and his desire to contribute returns with a load of wood turning back into the forest
others gather wood and as the light fades begin to take up positions by the growing fire roll cigarettes etc
voss looks anxiously for kazik
he has not returned
he moves along a right to left trajectory i
north heading away for the campsite his sight beginning to fade with the light
the group range out from the fire calling kaziks name
voss turns to janusz
he has night blindness
revised cherry a
kazik stumbling through the whiteout
did he hear his name
he moves on pleased to find by his side the professor from the mine
i thought i was alone
ive been walking with you for some time
ill just sit for a minute
sits beside him
not far to go
he points and kazik sees the pyramids of giza deep inside the fog
we made it
we really made it
isnt that something
they find kazik not a hundred yards from where they camped
the weather has broken the fog gone
he sits looking toward them his bare feet stretched out before him his eyes wide open
on his lips a frozen smile
they stand by his grave
a free man died here today
amens are muttered
the group remain by the grave reluctant to leave
all but valka who looks about restlessly
young always die first
the others look at him
in the camps
he looks at their somber faces
still one less mouth to feed what
youre all thinking the same thing
he wanders away toward the embers of their fire
smith hauling in fish hand over hand
the others watching in fascination
where did you learn to fish like that
lived in the woods a while
and how did you come to be in russia
i made a mistake
high wide panoramas the tiny figures of the fugitives threading their way through the trees heading steadily southward
close on nature naturing birds calling from high branches bees buzzing a grub crawling along a leaf
and a large animal grazing
or what appears at first to be an animal
its valka on all fours picking up and eating bugs
others are there grazing too
the weeks have taken their toll and they look thin and starving
we see in detail their search for anything edible hands digging out roots and berries of various kinds which are tested with a tentative nibble and sometimes spat out if
too bitter voss has made a small trap a noose rigged on a branch and just beyond it a nut
a squirrel watches
not all food is shared in this extreme situation and some with a furtive look about them eat what they find
they are camped at the mouth of a cathedral like cave and here tomasz amuses himself by sketching on the cave wall using charcoal from the fire
among portraits of the group are scenes from life in camp
on the fire a stew of water and pine needles bubbles away
zoran watches idly from where he lies near the cave entrance
theyll find our bones and your drawings a hundred years from now and say a fine example of early gulag man
shut up with your jokes
go and find food like the others
you do the shutting up
drawing like youre on holiday
they find food
what do you ever do
i make them laugh
not any more
zoran turns away from him curling up into a foetal position
smith walking through the vast cave his attention caught by two massive holes in the roof
he walks on toward their camp outside an opening at the far end
tomasz has water boiling on the fire
he calls to the what do you have
come on no holding back
smith approaches from the cave hands over two small fish his days catch
voss steps forward with a dead squirrel
valka has nothing
tomasz reaches for their cooking pot cooling by the fire
he passes a cup to pine needle tea
janusz sips reacts to the bitterness of the brew then passes it on
sleeping figures by the fire
tomasz tosses and turns muttering in his sleep
janusz is awake as is valka who sits close beside him
a whispered conversation who will be first
janusz looks at him
you mean the first to die
valka nods indicates tomasz
i think that sucker the artist
but better if it was him
he nods toward zoran
it might be you
why better if its zoran
valka squeezes the flesh of his upper arms
janusz shakes his head no
mister only gets little fish now
we must have meat or we die
youre the pakhan youve thought of it
we all have
thats why you brought extra people isnt it
an old urka escape trick
i swear to god you were an urka in another life
well get food when we get to lake baikal plenty of fish there
you said we should have seen lake a week ago
were lost pakhan
janusz stares into the fire as valka lays down to sleep
it is zorans turn on watch and he stands near the entrance to the cave his blanket about his shoulders looking out into the still night
behind him a low growling sound coming from deep in the cave
he turns a look of terror on his face
he can see nothing but a dim light deep in the cave where moonlight penetrates through two large holes in the cave roof
he wakes janusz alerting him to the sound
janusz in turn wakes valka and after taking burning sticks from the fire they walk back inside the vast cave toward the source of the sound valka drawing his knife
the dim light shows a wolf pack growling as they pick at a carcass on the cave floor
they drop their bones and face the intruders baring their fangs all now growling
on a signal from janusz they rush the wolves who run back toward another exit from the cave
smith tomasz and voss come hurrying to join them woken by all the barking and shouting
valka falls on part of the carcass cutting off chunks of raw meat
the others do likewise
wider on the group down on all fours chewing on the remains of the kill only janusz stands back watching them
some sleep on others stir their movements slow and listless
they are near the end
this has been januszs point of view as he packs a few scraps of food into his pockets and picks up his staff
those awake stare at him
ill be back in a week if i find the lake
if not youre on your own
i come too
shakes his head ill travel faster alone
smith will be the pakhan while im gone
janusz turns and with a nod of the head follow me to smith he moves off
now out of earshot janusz turns to smith
smith knows what its about
dont let him out of your sight
as janusz heads off into the forest
a magnificent vista a broad plain sweeping toward a distant line of hills
its a beautiful clear day and the lone figure of janusz dwarfed by the landscape walks steadily southward
sheltering from the wind on the leeside of a hill he takes pine cones from his pocket breaks them open and eats the seeds
then hes up and off again leaning heavily on his staff
the weather changes from a clear spring morning to cold and overcast as gusts of wind whip down from distant slopes
janusz bends into the wind his pace slowing
he stumbles sinks to the ground fighting the desire to let go to give himself to sleep and the swift death that will surely follow
his eyes begin to close
then he sees it
just ahead of him
the gate from his vision in the mine
he struggles to his feet staggers on
januszs vision a repeat of his earlier hallucination the click of the gate latch the flagstones at his feet as he moves down the path
all the while the accompanying sound is of januszs laboured breathing in the present reality
hes at the front door camera pans to the loose brick in the wall beside the door
janusz staggers back into camp half dead and shivering with cold
valka is quickly beside him with smith and three days from here
south by west
voss shouts for the fire to be built up hot water to be boiled
he feels his pulse checks his eyes
heat them in the fire
throughout the night they take turns replacing the hot stones surrounding his body and massaging his feet and hands
on one such occasion smith finds himself at januszs side
janusz opens his eyes
whats the brick
what did i say
something about a loose brick
janusz nods offers no explanation
you know if you dont pull through soon well have to leave you
i expect nothing less
so you better get better quick if you want to see home again
we couldve used you in the polish army
fired you out of a cannon
he closes his eyes lapses back into a deep sleep
its a beautiful evening as the file of travellers climb toward the crest of the hill
from the crest a panorama of lake baikal a massive body of water stretching to the horizon
the fugitives rest and consider the next stage of their journey
were going to have to follow the western shore
but look it bends like that wont it take us longer
see all those settlements on the other side
wed never get through
i swear to god those mother fuckers would cut off our heads take them to secret police
get more for us than they would for their fish
janusz impatient to move on is already on his feet
zoran rolls onto his back with a groan
smith and voss are last in line as they move cautiously along a dirt track
smith keeps looking back over his shoulder
what is it
smith signals janusz to stop while holding a finger to his lips for silence
janusz joins him followed by the others
were being followed
fifty yards back
a man on his own
may have seen us crossed into the trees beside the track
a silence as they consider their options
valka draws his knife
i think youve killed before
you say too many prayers for an innocent man
voss looks uneasy
he gives us away the soldiers will be on us in no time
valka go back on the other side of the track then come up behind in case he makes a run for it
valka moves off gliding through the trees on the left of the track
the others wait a beat then move into the trees on the right side of the track picking up fallen timber as weapons
janusz is in the lead when in a clearing not fifty paces ahead a figure steps out from behind a tree
janusz stops holding up a hand for the others to stay where they are
he stares at the small figure a young woman
theres a glimpse of a dirty skirt under her coat a scarf tied loosely about her neck
wisps of chestnut hair stray out from under a moth eaten fur hood
she looks frightened and desperate
from her waif like appearance its hard to tell her age an old thirteen or a young sixteen
the men discreetly drop their irovised weapons
she looks ready to make a run for it on seeing valka with his drawn knife
janusz gestures for the others to fall back as he cautiously approaches uttering reassuring words
the others sit smoking by the pathway watching as janusz crosses back from the girl to join them
he says something to tomasz in polish
a rapid exchange between them
what is it
been following us for several days
what does she want
shes been too afraid to approach us until she was sure we werent russians
she wants to travel with us
shes on the run like us
escaped from a russian collective farm
i swear to god i know this type street gypsies there are thousands like that less use than a dog
janusz looks back to the girl who watches them from the clearing
dont do this
we cant feed ourselves
maybe its kinder to leave her
shes been sent to us
we cant leave her
we have no choice
janusz knows this is true
the girl watches as janusz approaches
from the way he doesnt look at her she knows their answer
janusz stands before her a moment
they speak in polish sub titled
he reaches into his bag passes her a fish and some nuts and berries
its all she can do to refrain from eating it right away
what will you do
he guesses at what this might mean
if we had enough food she stares at him nods then walks back toward the path returning in the direction from which she came
the group walk in silence the encounter with the girl and their subsequent decision weighing heavily on some
voss keeps looking back over his shoulder
later the group walking out in the open by the lake when their attention is caught by the sight of a flock of ravens circling and diving on something up
ahead just out of sight around a bend in the lake
smith is the first to see it a full grown reindeer bogged to the shoulders in the soft mud by the lakes edge
as they approach the ravens rise in a great flapping of wings
the group circle the wild eyed beast pathetic in its attempts to pull itself out of the bog faced now with this new and more deadly threat
valka draws his knife
tomasz already has a fire going when the rest of the party appear dragging the carcass of the reindeer on an improvised sled made of driftwood
voss watches a moment as preparations are made to butcher the animal then he turns and hurries back in the direction from which they came
janusz watches him
he knows where hes going
voss moving fast beside the lake then onto the track running now retracing their steps
tomasz butchers more meat from the reindeer using valkas knife while smith sets up a wooden rotisserie on the fire assisted by zoran
janusz and valka are part way through skinning the beast when they pause on hearing footsteps
around the point comes voss followed by the girl
as they approach an expectant silence
her name is irena
they eat in silence savoring every mouthful
we hear the sounds of eating bones sucked to the marrow fingers licked bones crunching
irena is like a half starved animal eating with absorbed concentration the others sneaking looks in her direction as they savor the fresh killed meat
janusz has been on the last watch of the night and as dawn breaks he approaches his sleeping companions
he stares down at irena sleeping like a child by the fire
slowly the others stir all moving slowly and quietly not wanting to disturb her sleep
zoran has set himself up as camp barber trimming hair and shaving heads using the razor blade inserted in the end of a stick and for shaving cream a chunk
of fat from the reindeer
janusz has just been shaved and trimmed the last but for valka
while the others wash themselves and their clothes zoran calls for valka who approaches reluctantly and sits on the rock before the barber
why do we do this
so we dont look like thieves and robbers
zoran approaches him blade in hand
very still please
he tilts valkas neck seemingly the better to shave him
in fact he enjoys teasing valka and his movements are slow and ominous valka clearly nervous
various scenes of maintenance repairs and the breaking down of the reindeer into anything of use during their journey
two fires burn their regular cooking fire and one for the smoking of meat
voss cleaning bones of shreds of meat then beginning the construction of a bone frame for a backpack
he later gets part of the skin to form the bag attached to the frame
still later he collects nearby vines rolling them up for future use
revised tan a
tomasz in between sketching scenes of his friends at work he skims fat from the pot filled with boiling bones and lays out strips of meat given to him by
valka to dry in the sun part of the jerked meat they will carry as a long term food supply
valka with the wolf he separates sinews and tendons from the beast to form much needed bindings for their journey
he also cuts meat for their jerked supply or to be smoked
smith makes firstly a large bone needle then later makes repairs in his clothes
zoran after cleaning his teeth with a twig hangs his suit on a driftwood hanger and is seen brushing it with a branch from a pine tree
tomasz teases him and suggests he do something useful
later this leads to him sorting the boiled bones into various sizes a sort of accountant of the bone bank
customers come to him looking for bones or teeth for various uses
janusz works on the reindeer skin
with smiths help he stretches it to dry on a driftwood frame
later he cuts a piece off and gives it to voss for the back pack
he also works scraping the skin of strands of unwanted meat and fat
irena sleeps and eats
it is only at dusk one day she seems to come to life and moving to the lakeside washes her clothes and hair
the men try not to stare and whether their thoughts are carnal or not whether she reminds them of family or girlfriend they are all affected by her transformation from
boy urchin into a young woman when she returns washed and wearing the dress she has carried rolled up on her back
smith and janusz some distance from the campsite collecting wood
by the fire zoran leads the survivors band
he has them drumming on logs tapping sticks harmonizing amid much laughter
janusz watches irena
then he turns to smith
speaks good english
you dont like her do you
speak to valka about her
he doesnt even think shes polish
i did speak to him
and the others
they agree she comes with us
its decided then
apart from food shell slow us down
theres no room for sentimentality
you know that
and he turns moving back to the fire with his load of wood
refreshed and revived and laden with their supplies from the deer they make their way along a narrow dirt track by the lake
irena is aware that the main opposition to her joining with them comes from valka and smith
smith she knows is the more important and she tries to keep up with him
occasionally catching his eye she tries to charm him with a coquettish smile beyond her years
a river flowing into the lake presents an obstacle
they walk along the edge to where the river begins to narrow but here its still frozen and a quick test with januszs staff shows it to be too thin
to take their weight
they look upstream a distant figure of a man a hunter possibly a shotgun over his shoulder on their side of the bank
theres clearly no choice but to swim for it
they make hasty preparations removing outer clothing except shirts and trousers tying their boots about their necks
can you swim
you wouldnt lie to me
im not lying comrade
that was a slip of the tongue and smith is made uneasy by it
and dont call me comrade
with a shout the group plunge into the icy water swimming one handed their packs held above water level in the other
its only when they reach the other side they realize irena is still on the opposite bank
the others urge her to swim across
she hesitates a moment then runs upstream to where the river is frozen
they watch in astonishment as in a series of leaps and bounds shes out on the ice heading for the opposite bank
ice cracks beneath her feet and a couple of times it seems shell fall in but with a last great leap over a section of free flowing water she makes
it to the other side hurrying down to join the others a broad smile on her face
she looks defiantly at smith
janusz is worried about the man having seen them and urges them to follow him into the tree line
they scramble up a steep forested slope with occasional backward glances to see if the hunter is following
theres no sign of him
some time later the group still a little damp walk by the lake
irena walks beside smith whose long strides force her to jog occasionally to keep up
they swat at mosquitoes as they walk
janusz tells me your family were kulaks
just a cow and some pigs
were your parents arrested with you
she swats at a few mosquitos hovering around her face
we lived on a farm outside warsaw
when the russians came they said we were kulaks and exploiting the peasants
my parents were afraid and hid me in the barn
the mosquitos are getting worse and smith grabs swatches of leaves passing one to irena as they walk on swinging away at the annoying insects
i found them later
face down in the mud
theyd been bashed and strangled with barbed wire
she looks up at smith her eyes filling with tears
later the russians caught me and sent me to a collective farm
they were cruel to me
i ran away
i had no food
then i saw you
they walk in silence a few paces and she dries with the corner of her sleeve
you cant swim can you
she looks up at him
youve never been in the water in your life
she laughs coquettishly
but i got across didnt i
and you said you lived on a farm near warsaw
the soviets didnt get that far
that was german territory
she nervously swats the mosquitos
your parents werent murdered were they
you made it all up
pinched she wont look at him her face looks thin and she seems older
weve all done terrible things to survive
but dont ever lie to me again
weve had enough of lies
she sneaks a glance back over her shoulder at the others then up at smith
a fishing village by the lake
timber houses straggling back up into the surrounding hills
from cover they consider the obstacle
well have to go round it
quicker through it
theyll have dogs
raise the alarm
we wouldnt stand a chance we need food again pakhan
i know we need food but were not going into that town risk everything
smith gets up
were wasting time
he strikes off up a slope toward the hills behind the town
the group make their way uphill and around the town
down to the few lights of the town and the lake glimmering in the moonlight
from the direction of the town the sound of a dog barking in an agitated fashion
smith joins janusz
off his expression what is it
he was behind zoran
didnt you watch valka
im not his keeper
he looks back down to the town
a dim light through a side window the glimpse of a woman crossing through frame followed shortly after by the weathered face of a fisherman
hes heard something
he crosses to the window peers out into the darkness
the moment he turns away the camera moves on around the side to the rear of the building past a rabbit in a cage
valkas shoulder comes into frame as he edges his way toward the back door passing the sightless skull of a dried fish swinging from a cord under the eaves
he reaches for the door handle opens it and slips silently inside
town lakeside night alll a view along a road to the town
now on the opposite side of town to that seen earlier
is that of the group waiting for valka
theysit by the roadside looking toward the town
they swatat a cloud of mosquitoes
he could turn us in for the bounty
and risk arrest
hed bribe his way out of it
would he do that
its an opportunity
were rid of him
we dont need his knife
we can make one from deer bone
a movement behind them they turn as valka steps out from behind a tree
he stares back at them a crooked grin on his face
smith moves swiftly grabs him by his collar and spins him into the tree
hey easy cowboy
could have got us all killed
you tear my coat fool
he releases him and valka staggers back reaching down to a bulging sack
he tips out the contents various foodstuffs including a freshly killed rabbit and a bottle of vodka
fool is it
its then they notice blood splashed over his trousers
did i kill you ask
dont believe me
so dont eat
but you will wont you
because you want survival
i know about survival
all my life
he holds up the bottles of vodka one half empty and its my birthday
with a wild look in his eyes he passes a bottle to janusz then flicks the side of his neck with his middle finger
in russia that means we drink
tomasz tends the rabbit roasting on the fire while the vodka bottle is passed hand to hand
when not drinking the group are swatting at the persistent mosquitoes zoran now badly bitten
valka doesnt seem bothered by the mosquitoes perhaps tatoos keep them away anyway hes feeling generally pleased with himself and is very talkative
you know when they put the children of the political prisoners in the orphanage they change their names so later the parents can never find them
is that what happened to you
shakes his head i didnt have parents
but thats what happened to her
he passes irena the bottle
she glares back at him
you told me that
she glances at the puzzled faces of the others finally looking at smith
he holds her gaze
then she takes a slug of the vodka
they called me rykov but i remembered our polish name zulinski
i used to say it every night before i went to sleep
the story you told us i thought that story would be more sad and you wouldnt leave me behind
again she looks at smith
she made a promise to him
my parents were polish communists
they took us to live in soviet union to moscow
they want to work for the revolution
we lived in the hotel luxe with lots of foreign communists
but they arrested them
said they were spies
the police put me in the orphanage
and my brother
i was ten years old
and you ran away
valka grinning proudly at her
she lived in the streets like me
he breaks into one of his urki songs
its about a mother complaining to her son that hes a thief just like his father
it goes on and says but if you are strong enough to fight til death you will conquer fate
she joins valka in the chorus
the mosquitos continue to plaguethem swirling in clouds about their heads crawling intoears eyes and mouths
they have improvised headgear coats swatches of leaves improvised masks
many are badly bitten faces swollen bites infected
smith walks beside janusz
what can we do
steal a boat
people are going to get ill
after all weve faced how strange these tiny insects might defeat us
the group collect potatoes in a ploughed field by the lake
zoran can no longer take the mosquitoes and to the astonishment of the others he runs toward the water shedding his coat as he goes eventually diving into the water
and submerging himself
from a concealed position in the trees they watch as half a dozen peasants walk by the lake
zoran studies them intently
the others unsure of his meaning
they have no mosquitos
the group have by now a walking routine which they rarely vary always occupying the same positions in extended line
janusz as navigator in the lead smith generally bringing up the rear
irena is the exception varying her place now with one now with another
they dont talk much to each other as they walk but they do talk with her
she has the knack of getting anyone to talk
no doubt a skill learnt in her life on the streets
a small fire burns as tomasz cooks a fish stolen by valka
the smoke from the fire is not enough to alleviate the mosquito problem and the group swat in miserable silence
suddenly smith throws dirt on the fire suffocating it with his jacket
he points to the road
from their point of view a fisherman in his fifties a basket in a sling on his back walks abreast of them on the track
as he passes zoran speaks in a whisper to janusz
there it is
look at him
janusz stares again at the man
zoran is up and off before anyone can stop him
they watch in appalled silence as he approaches and speaks to the man who regards this stranger appearing from the forest with some suspicion
zoran does a kind of crazy dance talking all the while
soon the man is laughing and putting down his bag and gun he takes something from around his neck and places it on zorans neck
a few more words and more laughter then with a handshake zoran heads back into the forest the man continuing on his way
zoran rejoins them holding up the gift from the old man strands of intertwined bark
and i have the formula
they all wear necklaces of the entwined bark and are mosquito free
zoran is the hero of the hour
but what did you say to him
that i was an escaped convict who was being plagued by mosquitos
as they round a bend and disappear from sight tomaszs voice drifts back
but what did you really say
janusz scoops up a handful of water where it laps a beach
its a symbolic end to their lake trek and they turn and walk on the lake behind them
in the far distance a large town dominated by a collection of smoke stacks belching out columns of smoke into the sky as the group hurry across open ground to
the shelter of the forest
a rustic cart passes by
after it has gone the fugitives emerge from concealment and resume their journey
revised buff aa
voss zoran and tomasz talk of their pre gulag days with a small stone church in a little village
i grew up in that village
then i went on business
once a year government clients of course
then layers of very fine pastry so when you bite there is a lightness a delicacy it should almost melt in the mouth
the group move at a brisk pace
irena walks beside
and tomasz is a pastry chef but wants to be an artist
is that right
and zoran was on business in moscow arrested in red square he said he was just taking a photo of the kremlin
hes an accountant
well ill be damned
never knew a funny accountant
dont you talk to each other
in the camps you learn to say as little as possible
they walk on in silence irena sneaking a look up at him
irena now walking with janusz
working on the moscow metro
hes an engineer
his father was finnish
grew up in america but he could speak russian
why did he come to russia for gods sake
his son came with him
what happened to his son
they shot him
he was seventeen
the group fords a shallow stream when irena sees smith limp to a rock where he sits and inspects his blistered bleeding feet irena kneels before him dries his feet
with her dress
the others watch silently as she tears strips from her petticoat and binds up the raw spots between his toes
the group look down to see the railway track lined with villagers every few miles making a crossing especially hazardous
the mongolian border is on the other side of those tracks
two armed soldiers can be seen walking along the tracks
cant we go around this
this is the main line
its going to be like this everywhere
we dont have a choice
we cross at night
their attention is caught by the passing of a long freight train horn sounding over the bucolic scene
a visible tension in the group as they wait
valka whittles a piece of deer bone
whats that youre making
revised salmon a
a cross for your tombstone
tomasz surprised at his tone
why should you care what im making
the evening is hot and valka has his shirt open the tattooed portraits of lenin and stalin on his chest appear and disappear in the folds of his shirt
this amuses zoran
why do you have arseholes tattooed on your chest
shouldnt they be on your arse so you sit on them every time you take a shit
you think its funny
they are great men
watch your eyes crowbait
he makes a v with his fingers followed by a short stabbing motion
zoran reels back
dont you know what stalin means funny man
man of steel
he takes from rich and gives to poor
sure he does
then he puts both of them in a camp for twenty five years
valka goes back to his carving
janusz stands on the tracks lookingdownthelinetoa cutting where the track disappearsaroundabend
the sound of an approaching train a dim light already reflected on the side of the cutting
he turns and looks toward the trees where the others are approaching down a wooded hillside
he hurries toward them urging them to take cover in the bracken beside the track
smith points out a glowing red light further down the track from the approaching train
the train thunders into the cutting with a squeal of breaks as the driver sights the red light on the track ahead and the train slows to a stop
close on the faces of the escapees as they look up to the carriages stopped in front of them
they are cattle cars but its soon apparent their cargo is human
from the high windows hands can be seen clutching the bars
from inside a communal groaning and sighing
voices female voices cry out for water and on the agonized faces of the fugitives a mixture of pain and empathy
then the train seems to sigh like a great beast and from beneath the carriages flow streams of blood and urine
as the distant light turns green the train slowly moves forward and as it does so letters and notes drop to the tracks from the barred windows
after it is gone they scramble over the tracks into the woods on the other side all but voss
he is picking up as many of the notes and letters as he can
andrejs for gods sake
voss slowly crosses the tracks and disappears into the brush
voss overwhelmed with emotion sits down examining the letters and notes in his hand
janusz hurries back for him
but voss doesnt move
janusz sits beside him and voss passes him a sample of the prisoners pathetic messages some scrawled on the back of photographs
they are mostly names and addresses pleas for someone to mail or inform relatives of what happened to them some have even clipped a few bank notes to pay for
tall striped posts at intervals strung with rusted wire beyond a dirt road and distant fields
from a concealed position in the nearby trees they carefully watch for signs of a patrol
janusz goes first passing easily through the sagging fence
zoran calls to him
whats it like in mongolia
janusz holds up a hand keep your voice down
zoran crawls through the wire followed by the others
i love mongolia
love it later
we need to get as far from this border as possible
zoran faces russia and as if bowing at the end of a performance
thank you mother russia for your hospitality
i definitely will not be coming back
its only then that we notice that valka has not crossed through
he stands staring at them from the soviet side
its clear hes going no further
janusz crosses back to him and they talk through the wire
theyll catch you if you stay you know that
prison is o
debt is bad
but there are many prisons
they dont find me
they stand a moment watching the others moving toward a line of trees
its not for me freedom
wouldnt know what to do with it i swear to god
he places his hand on the wooden hilt of his knife sticking out of his waistband
so we must say goodbye my wolf and me
janusz glances at the knife
you dont need him any more
good luck valka
good luck pakhan
and he turns and walks away
janusz walks toward the distant group and by the time he looks back valka is gone
a vast plain stretches to distant snow capped peaks
dotted on the hills the gers circular tent like structures home to the nomadic mongolians
in the distance walk the band of survivors strung out in a line abreast
their voices drift back snatches of conversation
the travellers striding confidently down the dirt road
around a bend a decorative archway over the road a town visible a few miles further on
they stop in their tracks
on one side of the timber structure a portrait of josef stalin
on the other the local mongolian leader a red star on his military cap
in the centre the hammer and sickle over a painting of a brown hand shaking a white one
small flags of both nations flap ominously
close on the stunned faces of the fugitives
its here too
this changes everything
irena looks at the grassy plains all about them
nowhere to hide
the group walk toward a distant line of hills feeling very exposed to any watching eyes
how far is china
five six hundred kilometers
is china free
theres a war on with the japanese i know that much
after china is tibet
but isnt tibet closed to foreigners
i remember reading that
their religion would compel them to shelter us
we could go to lhasa the capital
we break out of one closed country and now we plan to break into another
i like open countries
tomasz and janusz exchange a few excited words in polish
they say we could go beyond tibet
over the mountains
shakes his head the himalayas
we could join the british army
first fight nazis then russians
go over the himalayas
on a magic carpet
a silence as they contemplate the massive distances stretching ahead of them
in the middle of an empty plain a small circular stone ruin
a gentle tip tapping sound
voss opens his eyes
staring back at him from the doorway half a dozen sheep
he nudges tomasz who wakes sleepily takes his eye line
carefully slowly they rise voss drawing his deer bone knife
then they move
the sheep retreat bumping into each other and outside the chase is on
tomasz tackles a ewe and voss approaches with a knife but janusz is behind him grabs his arm
voss tries to free his arm
dont kill it
you want the locals after us too
they break into polish a blazing argument months of pent up frustration
voss picks up the sheep and carries it inside the ruin
milk squirting into their aluminium bowl as voss expertly milks the ewe irena and zoran holding it steady
the sun is blazing as they cross through a sea of grass hills rising in the distance like islands
tomasz and zoran play a long distance walkers game each in turn kicking a rock out ahead continually passing it from one to the other
janusz and smith look to the hills surrounding them as they walk
you feel it
were being watched
irena uneasy squints in the direction of the hills
and you can feel it
like a john ford western theres a sense of being in indian territory of their every move watched by unseen eyes
a distant view of a temple complex at the base of low hills
the above has been pointed out by voss to the group and they decide to make their way to the temple in the hope of getting food
within a walled compound they wander between a series of recently abandoned buddhist temples and out buildings
by the size of the compound several hundred monks may have lived here
everywhere are signs of violence doors hang from hinges and a large statue of buddha lies smashed in a courtyard
janusz points to a line of bullet impacts stitched across a wall
there are bloodstains on the floor and the wind howling about the building makes a haunting accompaniment
irena and voss are alone inside
what happened here
the same as happened in russia
churches closed priests shot or taken to camps religion banned
they came to my church in latvia
destroyed everything declared it a museum
later that night there was a lone guard
i strangled him until his eyes popped right out of his head
valka knew somehow
knew id killed in cold blood
he bows his head
irena looks up at him and they stand together in silence but for the moaning wind
as they head south each is lost in their own thoughts when seemingly out of nowhere a half dozen mongolian horsemen are galloping toward them
the horsemen circle them far from friendly looks on their faces
they wear the traditional costume of steppe nomads and range in age from a man in his seventies down to a six year old boy
the old man pulls up his horse in front of smith figuring as hes the oldest hell also be the leader
the groups stare at each other
the old man speaks in russian a rough guttural accent
a glance between smith and janusz
much may hang on his answer
the old man maybe doesnt get the american part but he gets that they are not russian
he seems pleased about that
janusz points south
we are too poor to have horses
the old man points at irena
smith looks at irena
irena moves closer to him
smith puts a protective arm about her shoulder
the old man considers the situation for a moment longer before abruptly turning and followed by his band galloping off toward the distant hills
looks between the group not exactly of relief as theres a feeling it may not be the last they see of the riders
irena looks up at smith smiles at him
something about him calling her his daughter has touched some hidden place
smith a little embarrassed smiles back
while smith fishes in the river others tend to their battered feet
voss passes around deer fat in his improvised deer skull container
this they rub over raw patches and between their toes where deep cracks have developed
janusz repairs their footwear while tomasz sits by the fire sketching irena
zoran the camp barber trims hairs and beards tomasz is smoking fish over the fire as the group stir
he gives zoran a kick
what did you do that for
i was in the middle of this beautiful dream just about to eat some salt i could already taste it
i want to go back to that dream
the figures seen walking away in the distance
floating back the voice of tomasz giving a recipe of a favorite polish dish to zoran
then add two sprigs of rosemary and a pinch of nutmeg
what about the salt
well get to that
now add the oil and leave it to marinate while you prepare the chicken
thats where the salt comes in
rub it into the skin of the chicken with a little of the paprika
double the salt
i cant just double the salt
itll be too salty
i dont care just do it
im not going to ruin it
a primaeval and austerely beautiful landscape stretches before them
tufty knolls of dry grass are the only detail that break up the flat immensity
up ahead of them on the edge of a ridge a lone mongolian horseman watches them approach
hes the young boy from the group of horseman who originally approached them
they pause before him
he looks at them a moment then tosses a goatskin bag at their feet before galloping off in the direction from which they came
voss picks up the skin bag gives it a shake
they continue on to the edge of the ridge and a view of a vast desert plain is revealed
they look back to the disappearing horseman before scrambling down the rocky slope
the group crossing into the heart of the gobi
voss is the first to see it a vast glittering lake
they hurry toward it
the lake leads them on but appears no closer
janusz has taken a reading of the sun using his stick method
he points out their direction it is away from the beckoning lake
janusz hesitates looks at voss who holds up their water bag
we should go to the lake
water is getting low
its a mirage
he plods on away from the shimmering vision
theres little the others can do but trust janusz and slowly they follow
the sun is directly above the land shimmering with heat the group have stuck their sticks in the ground and draped their jackets over them making a sunshade they shelter
the sun has dropped casting shadows
janusz rises from the shelter and calls for the others to continue
the figures tiny in the surrounding desert walk on janusz in the lead needing to constantly slow down to allow the others to catch up
the group hesitate on hearing a distant roaring sound up ahead
nothing on the horizon
then they are hit by a fierce wind as toward them rolls a vast cloud of sand
they drop to the ground instinctively and huddled together throw blankets around their shoulders and over their heads as they are engulfed in the choking sand
later they emerge from their own dune and shaking themselves down they resume their journey southward
the temperature has dropped to freezing and they huddle by a fire picking sand out of their small ration of food
im too tired to sleep
why not keep walking
im for that if we can wake andrejs
they look to where voss sleeps
he can sleep anywhere any time
how does he do it
can you plot your way by the stars
revised salmon a
yes but havent you noticed
he points upward to the low clouds obscuring the stars
what about water
what about it
i dont see any
im trying to remember my school geography but i seem to recall the gobi desert somewhere in southern mongolia
janusz begins scooping out a hole in the pebbly ground
its funnel shaped narrow at the base
the others watch as he lines the sides with dried deerskin placing their cooking pot in the base
we may pick up a little morning dew
glad of something practical to do they all set about digging and lining holes with anything to hand
as they wake they harvest the precious droplets of water caught overnight trickling the contents into their pot barely a quarter cupful
no one has slept much and they walk like zombies strung out in a line no one speaking all just dully concentrating on placing one foot after the other
zoran notices voss walking behind him is actually asleep
he has swung his backpack onto his chest and with his head resting on it he is actually sleep walking
zoran tests his theory by walking away from the group in a small circle
voss follows guided by the sound of zorans footsteps
he wakes him voss looking around with a start
you were asleep
no i wasnt
you were following the sound of my footsteps sleep walking
the others have stopped
zoran takes the backpack from voss and places it on the exhausted irena
just follow the sound of my footsteps
she nods not fully understanding
put all else out of your mind and sleep
ill wake you in calcutta
she smiles nods already half asleep
zoran looks over his shoulder smiles proudly as he sees irena is sleep walking trusting to the steady sound of his footsteps
the group rest under the meagre shade provided by their coats
smith walks away from them and crests a slight rise
from here he has a clear view to the horizon
off in the distance a dark patch against the light sand
through the dancing mid day light he sees shapes
he staggers back to the group
janusz follows him to the rise
smith points to his discovery
janusz squints against the light
its another mirage
smith shakes his head no
we have no more water
i see trees
where theres trees theres water
we must head south
the others have joined them staring toward the distant shape
ive never doubted you janusz
but we must give it a try
we must keep going south
youll kill us all
damn it were already dying
janusz goes to move on smith grabs his shirt sleeve a short pathetic struggle sees them fall to their knees voss and tomasz move to separate them
smith is the first to stand brushing sand and dirt from his clothes
he turns to the others
you have a choice
he looks at irena then turns and goes back for his staff and jacket
the others watch as he turns east toward his discovery
its a mirage
just a mirage
smith keeps walking away a strange echo of the incident in siberia when he walked away from the guards
perhaps it is this memory that causes the others to turn silently and collecting their few possessions to follow him
janusz watches a while then slowly follows
close on smith as he squints against the glare
his point of view close on tomasz as he stares ahead of him
his point of
close on zoran
his point of view back on zoran
mirages dont have birds
wider and theyre running running with the last of their precious energy
a clump of straggly tortured trees surround a desert well a low square of ancient stones
they sprawl by the well smith reaching down inside with their bowl to bring up a scoop of crystal clear water
its passed around rapidly
just a little
dont fill yourselves
more scoops follow in quick succession enough to splash hands and faces
voss calls from a few yards away
coals are still warm
smith and janusz join him examining the ground about the fire
lots of tracks
maybe others will come
the remains of a meal
theres still meat on the bones
he points to the cooked remains of some animal
using vosss deer bone knife he scrapes meat from the bones others just attacking any bone they find
dont eat it all
he manages to save at least half of the meat wrapping it in a cloth and putting it in vosss backpack
they lie stretched out under the shade of the trees dozing and every now and then going back to the well to drink or just to lay their hands in
the cool water
irena sleeps while the men discuss their situation in hushed tones
at least we have water here
but no food
other nomads will come
water their flocks
we could wait a few days at least
without food well only get weaker
maybe too weak to travel
these last days i dont know that i could go through that again
looks at the water it was a miracle finding this
can we count on another
i say we stay
they look to smith
he looks up to find them watching him
what are you looking at me for
hes already made up his mind for us havent you janusz
janusz says nothing
they all take a last drink from the well then pour water over their faces and clothes
voss fills the skin water bag then zoran fills their cooking bowl to the brim
steamis rising from their damp clothing when they set off
zoran walking on tip toe anxiousnot to spill a dropfrom the bowl in his outstretchedhand
close on tomasz as he looks back over his shoulder to close on zoran as he too turns for a last look at close on voss he shades his eyes
to see they walk in a desert void
there are no features no distant hills no growth of any kind
it is an emptiness the only sound that of their footsteps and their labored breathing
all the while their water supply is dwindling water from zorans bowl long gone the goat skin water bag no longer sloshes but has to be squeezed to get out
even a mouthful
janusz hands out small portions of the scavenged meat from the waterhole
all of them are subject to cramps the result of the lack of water and from time to time they are seen reacting to a sudden bolt of pain attempting
to stretch against it or massage the limb out of its paralysis
smith and janusz collect more dried camel dung for the fire
smith looks to where the others sit
were in trouble
i know that but they mustnt
you can survive a month or more without food but water
maybe two days maybe less in this heat
what about what were getting from condensation
its the only thing keeping us alive
but for how long
can you get us back to the waterhole
as they walk voss picks up a pebble holds it up to show zoran who walks behind him
when we worked the fields during the hot summers we used to suck on small stones like these
dont know why but it made us feel less thirsty
zoranpicks up a pebble
weve eaten just about everything else
you dont eat it just suck on it
at this moment irena falls again her knees buckling and her face pitching into the sand in almost one movement
they turn her over again wiping the sand from her nose and mouth
smith makes a shelter over her with their sticks and jackets
she lies with her eyes closed her breathing coming in harsh gasps
both legs are now swollen to the knees
he touches the swelling and the marks his fingers make remain for some seconds
im becoming a nuisance
she looks down at her legs
do they hurt you
no not at all
they must be swelling because ive walked so far
dont you think mister
smith nods reassuringly then quickly turns away a look of deep anguish passing across his face
the others keep watch over her as she sleeps
smith passes around a splash of water in the cup
they all refuse it
save it for irena
weve got our pebbles
and he pops one in his mouth makes out its delicious and soothing
in the now familiar ritual they scoop out holes in the sand lining them with their jackets hopeful of collecting a little moisture overnight
they walk on zoran carefully carrying the partly filled bowl of water
irena seems refreshed but janusz and smith walk beside her watching her every step
i can walk alright if i can lean a little on you
they each lightly lay a hand on her elbow
irena starts to fall forward they steady her and she walks on for a bit before slumping forward and falling to her knees
smith too falls with exhaustion
voss hurries back to them
can you go on
i think so
but what about mr
smith struggling for breath is back on his feet waving them on
voss and janusz each put an arm about her and half carrying half dragging her they set off again but its no use shes lost all her strength
im going to carry her
a lizard in close up listens to an approaching sound
as the volume builds he runs for his life
a beetle too has heard it and burrows into the sand as a foot in a battered moccasin looms large in frame
we follow the foot a few staggering steps then a blur as a body falls through frame ending in a close up of tomasz his breath coming in short gasps
the five figures small in frame tomasz the last in line down on his knees
he raises a hand hasnt the strength to call out
then one of the figures sees him calls to the others
close on tomasz
he pulls the leg of his trousers up with difficulty the tell tale swelling of the ankles just as with irena
as janusz approaches he quickly covers his legs and staggers to his feet
janusz steadies him and taking his arm they continue
as they walk the landscape changes from the endless scrubby plain to sweeping sand dunes
the nature of the terrain makes the going slower and they move forward on the edge of exhaustion
in a curious freak of nature the wind whips across the top of the dunes creating an eerie singing sound
ahead and across their path a massive dune no way forward but over it
tomasz looks up staring in horror the dune is moving rising up higher and higher like a massive sand wave
back on tomasz
he collapses unconscious
an eerie ghostly twilight the group all sitting together in a rough circle around tomasz
he seems to revive as he passes around sketches hes made during their imprisonment and escape
its an almost cheerful scene like a traveller showing happy snaps taken on holiday
i like this one
when did you do that
he holds up a sketch of kazik showing him examining one of his battered shoes
on the train
poor kazik always the trouble with his feet
zoran holds up a drawing of himself
zoran looks at it again genuinely shocked
my father maybe but is that how i look now
a chuckle from the others
smith stares at a sketch of irena
you caught her smile
smith passes the sketch to janusz as tomasz lays back down a smile on his face
he looks up at the stars
he knows hes dying and has accepted the fact
this in turn has given strength to his friends and between them all is a feeling of love and a kind of peace
theyve tied his pencil to a length of hide and hung it from the top of the cross over his grave
a faint breath of morning breeze sets it swinging like a pendulum the others long gone
as they stagger on janusz has moved well out in front when he stumbles and falls
then he sees it just out ahead and he begins crawling toward it
its the hedge and gate from his vision
behind the hedge the hint of a roof
through the gate can be seen the path to the front door
janusz crawling faster now when zoran appears beside him
do you see it
come on jan
but do you see it
he helps him to his feet and they continue on
in the glare of the noon day sun they shelter under their coats propped on their walking staffs
no one speaks
smith and janusz support each other as they stagger on
smiths eyes are on the ground following the dancing shadows before him
janusz nudges him points above them two magnificent eagles the source of the shadows
eagles live in mountains
smith looks at the featureless landscape ahead
they also fly long distances
the dunes are more intermittent here the ground more stony and undulating
voss hears it first and with his remaining strength moves out of the circle of firelight into the desert
he pauses listens again
a scraping sound
then he sees them coming out of the gloom janusz dragging an unconscious smith by his shoulders
voss hurries to them
a look from janusz water
voss shakes his head no
a black snake thick as your wrist slides over zorans leg
he stares too close to death to feel fear
hes not even entirely sure its real
he watches its progress as it slithers up the rocky hillside
then he gets it and hes up running on pure adrenaline following after the snake leaving his sleeping companions by the fire
zoran tracking the snake
he mutters to himself in a kind of delirium
he is crawling after the snake scraping skin from knees and elbows
the snake disappears down into a rocky defile followed by zoran
smith in a death like sleep
a distance away voss and janusz stand staring upward at the waving figure some fifty metres up the hill
black mud obscures his face
he waves dances about then in a cracked voice a single word drifts down to them
zoran janusz voss lie flat out like lizards their faces in damp black mud
they slurp at small pools of water split lips puffed and bleeding
at first just to swallow is painful but it is life
after each mouthful there is a moment they must wait as the seepage re fills the little hollows
theyve carried smith to the water and janusz supports him in a sitting position while voss and zoran in turn soak their shirts in the mud dripping the life giving
liquid into smiths mouth
he coughs splutters as he sucks at the moisture
a black snake protruding about a foot out of a hole in the sandy soil
zoran points and is joined by janusz and voss
janusz holds his hand up for them to go very still
he speaks in a whisper
voss passes him the deer bone knife
with it he splits the end of his staff to make a fork out of the end
what if its poisonous
you can still eat it
just cut off its head
he passes the knife to voss then creeps toward the creature and striking quickly he attempts to trap the snake in the fork
the snake disappears into its hole
like snake fishermen they sit waiting bythe snake hole zoran too has a snake catching stick
then they see a second snake slithering across the rocks
at a signal they strike zoran deftly trapping the snakes head in the cleft stick
chunksofwhitish snake meat are cooking on a thin flat stoneovera fire of twigs and grass
the men grab piecesofthe snake and eat nodding approval
its not bad
janusz helps smith sit up feeding him a small piece of meat
smith waves him away sinking back to the ground too tired to eat
kind of like chicken
yeah a long black poisonous chicken with no legs
you know valka talked of eating each other
would you have eaten me
i would never have eaten you too stringy and bitter id rather eat snake
voss nearly chokes on something reaches into his mouth pulls out a tooth
the fire burns low voss and zoran sleep
smith wakes from time to time and janusz forces him to eat and drink
smith is deathly pale his life ebbing away
he speaks in short croaky stabs every breath an effort
it can kill you remember
janusz tries to force more water on him but smith waives him away
how long can you survive on snakes and mud
you should leave me but you cant can you
youre a fool
id leave you
he lays back down
janusz studies his face pain and suffering etched in sharp lines
i mightnt know youur first name but i know your sons name
smith stares at him
irena told you
can i say his name
nothing from smith
saying his name ont bring him back
he struggles onto his elbow staring intently at janusz an ironic smile on his lips
you trying to give me the will to live
stop me giving up
are you giving up
in the camps some saw death as freedom
so why didnt you kill yourself
survival was a kind of protest
janusz makes him take a little water
now being alive is my punishment
punishment for what
i brought david to russia didnt and no one can forgive you
and you cant forgive yourself
be easier if i had religion or a home to go back to like you
for us the old life is gone
they sit in silence for a while
irena told me they tortured your wife and she informed on you
they did that to my boy
my wife was released that much i know
she lived but like you she wont be able to forgive herself
only i can do that
he leans closer to smith speaks just above a whisper his voice intense his eyes burning
shell torture herself for what she did
just like you
thats why i have to get back
this last has impressed smith and despite his death wish a flicker of life surges through his bones
next morning and the figures of the four men are seen in wide shot sleeping by the embers of their fire
one figure gets up picks up his staff and begins to walk slowly south toward the distant mountains
the others stir their attention caught by the sight of smith staggering onward
janusz knows what the effort to walk is costing him and he knows this is smiths gift to him
they hurriedly pack up voss cramming the back pack with roasted snake meat zoran collecting a last bowl of water which he pours carefully into their goatskin water bag
janusz catches up with smith giving him his arm in support and together they slowly continue their journey southward
they leave the desert behind as they climb gently rising ground
the survivors each seen alone as they experience the life giving water one simply lets water run though his fingers another submerges himself entirely one drinks savoring every mouthful as
if it were the finest vintage wine
beside him several of his catch gleam silver in the light
walking abreast they head toward a pass between two massive mountains in the distance gleaming snow capped peaks rise even higher
they sleep huddled together amongst the stony rubble
it is snowing
voss is the first to rise
he looks about him in disbelief shakes the others awake pointing
just beyond where theyve slept a high wall towers above them
in this extreme western section its in poor shape not built of stone but of ancient mud bricks tumbled down in many places but to the east the outline is
distinct as it straggles over ridges to the horizon the great wall of china
they enter through a keyhole like opening formed by collapsed masonry now dressed in their cold weather clothing
from high above a series of aerial shots take us over a massive snow covered mountain range
the men climb steadily up snow covered hills pausing at a cairn of stones covered with tiny flags
they move on with renewed energy
close on the deeply lined face of a shepherd
he wears tibetan costume and squints his eyes as he stares into the distance
from his p
four distant figures walking across the snowy plain toward him
the sound of dogs barking
far below in a valley lies the legendary lhasa the stepped palace and surrounding town burnished by the last of the golden light
a sprinkling of lights come on as the shadows lengthen
above and beyond like a massive wall rise the snow capped peaks of the himalayas
this has been theview stretching out before the four fugitives andtheirtour guide the old shepherd
as if pointing outthechoice confronting them he labels each of these spectacular features
lhasa lha sa
then indicating over the mountains in dumb show he mines that the mountains would be very cold
three horses arrive at the door of the lonely hut and its associated outbuildings
the shepherd dismounts and with much bowing opens the door for two other tibetans who follow
one is a lpma the other a local official
they stoop as they enter a glimpse inside to where the four survivors sit at a table surrounded by bowls and plates of food
the lama and the official sit opposite the group
tea is served
the official speaks english with difficulty and as in mongolia he addresses the elder of the group mr
there is the track to sikkim over the mountains
many people go there
small villages there
they give food
wood for fire
yes but you dont go now
close on janusz intensely following the conversation
why cant we go now
if big snow come very difficult
you wait here until spring
this family keep you
he confers with the lama
thats three months
indicates the lama he go to lhasa
get permission for to stay
only to spring
not possible foreigners stay tibet
smith bows his head mutters thanks all of the group doing likewise
the shepherd has seen janusz zoran and voss to their quarters
he passes voss a battered oil lamp and retires with much bowing
they settle on the straw covered floor laying out their heavy wool fleeces and blankets given to them by the shepherds wife
well we cant cross in winter
he said it was difficult
smith comes in and they make room for him in the cramped space
im going to sleep till spring
like a bear in a cave
what about you mister
smith settles with his back to the wall draws up his sheepskin
im going to lhasa
the others are stunned by this
the lama has a contact maybe get me out through china
theres a u
military mission there
they dont like it
a feeling hes deserting them breaking up the team
looking after number one
isnt that what americans say
zoran eventually looks at him
we made it
voss blows out the lamp
silvery moonlight from a small window
i just realized it
apart from a few mountains were there
we made it
not all of us
not all of us
their thoughts drift back to their lost companions
what will you do mister
when you get home
might drift for a while
havent you had enough of that
close on janusz hardly listening his thoughts elsewhere
their late night conversation drifts over him
i will fight
first germans then russians
then re build your church
i will die fighting
this statement has an oddly prophetic sound
janusz look across at him
im going to get tomaszs pictures to a newspaper or get them published somehow
then im going to cook his chicken but with extra salt just to annoy him
chuckles from the group
and you janusz
as long as the communists are in poland he cant go back
theyd shoot you wouldnt they janusz
they settle down to sleep outside the wind is picking up
ill just keep on going
until its over
keep on walking
smith looks through the gloom to where janusz sits moonlight slashes the side of his face but he cant quite see his eyes
close on janusz
hes wide awake
no thought of sleep
zoran and voss agitated at the discovery that janusz has gone
much coming and going in and out of the hut checking that he isnt somewhere close by
only smith remains undisturbed as he sits with his back against the wall the ghost of a smile on his lips
he expected nothing less
up ahead a figure janusz dwarfed by the mountain chain struggles on climbing toward the snow capped passes
as he climbs he hears a cry mingling with that of the wind a voice echoing about the mountains
he ignores it for a few paces before he looks back far below two figures waving and calling voss and zoran
the change from the barren mountains of tibet to the lush green of sikkim is abrupt and startling from rocky upper reaches the slope to the valley becomes rich in
scrubby birch woods rhododendrons and deciduous forest until finally it becomes dense rain forest
it is with a backdrop of this luxuriant green that indian faces look up toward the slopes
here they watch three wild looking bearded men descending toward them
the additional cost of this final leg of their journey is plainly visible on their faces and in their slow stumbling movements
they walk like automatons only their senses fully alive
shouts from the locals produce a village elder then a policeman
older children squeal with delight while some of the very young cry out in fear one even bursting into tears are these the dreaded yeti their grandfathers told them lived
up in the mountain peaks
close on janusz voss and zoran as the beaming policeman escorts them past dozens of smiling faces
this being india a small crowd of the curious rapidly swells until the path is lined two and three deep on either side like a welcoming crowd at the end
of a marathon
small children are held up for a better look while hands reach out patting their backs and shoulders its as if they know these men have achieved something remarkable
close on janusz as amongst the sound of the gathering crowd other voices join in cheering voices hundreds of them rising in volume until the cheering changes into that of
a chant now seemingly swelled by thousands of voices
still close on janusz walking as behind him the indian scene dissolves into a series of black and white images
throughout the image of janusz walking is from this scene in india
the camera moves toward a gate in a hedge
the click of the latch as it opens
a downward view of the flagstones
the front door the camera pans left
the loose brick
a hand into frame removes a key from behind the brick
into the lock of the door the door pushed open
a woman sitting by a window
shes in her early seventies and she looks up expectantly on hearing the door closing in the hallway
at the entrance to the room appears a young man in polish cavalry uniform young janusz as he was just before the war
he smiles at his wife
cut back to the seat by the window to see his pretty young wife as she was back in
young janusz smiling broadly crosses toward her
cut back to his wife of on her face there are lines of suffering which fade as she smiles up at him
shes waited a long time for him to come home
on janusz now as he sits opposite her and for the first time we see him as he is in also in his early seventies
without a word he reaches across the table and takes her hand in his
