march a l start the picture with the actual street sign sunset boulevard stencilled on a curbstope
in the gutter lie dead leaves scraps of paper burnt matches and cigarette butts
it is early morning
now the camera leaves the sign and moves east the grey asphalt of the street filling the screen
as speed accelerates to around m
traffic de marcations white arrows speed limit warnings man hole covers etc
superimposed on all this are the credit titles in the stencilled style of the street sign
over the scene we now hear mans voice sirens
police squad cars yes this is sunset hurtle toward the camera boulevard los angeles turn off the road into a california
its about driveway with squealing five oclock in the brakes
dismounted motor morning
thats the cycle cops stand directing homicide squad com the cars in
plete with detectives and newspaper men
a patio and pool of a murder has been re mansion ported from one of those great big houses in the the policemen and news ten thousand block
paper reporters and youll read all about photographers have it in the late editions jumped out of the cars im sure
youll get and are running up to it over your radio the pool in which a and see it on tele body is seen floating
vision because an photographers bulbs old time star is in flash in rapid suc volved
one of the big cession
but before you hear it all distorted and blown out of proportion before those hollywood columnists get their hands on it maybe youd like to hear the facts the whole
angle up through the if so youve come to the water from the bottom right party
you see of the pool as the the body of a young man body floats face down was found floating in the ward
it is a well pool of her mansion with dressed young man
two shots in his back and one in his stomach
no body important really
just a movie writer with a couple of b pictures to his credit
the poor dope
he always wanted a pool well in the end he got himself a pool slow dissolve to only the price turned out to be a little high
lets go back about six a hollywood seen from months and find the day the hilltop at ivar when it all started
it is a crisp sunny i was living in an day
the voice con apartment house above tinues speaking as franklin and ivar
camera pans toward things were tough the alto nido apart at the moment
i hadnt ment house an ugly worked in a studio for moorish structure ofsat a long time
so i stucco about four there grinding stories high
camera out original stories moves toward an open two a week
only i window on the third seemed to have lost floor where we look my touch
maybe they in on joe gillis apart werent original ment
joe gillis bare enough
maybe they footed and wearing no were too original
thing but an old bath all i know is they robe
is sitting on didnt sell
in front of him
on a straight chair is a portable typewriter
beside him on the bed is a dirty ashtray and a scattering of type written and pencil marked pages
gillis is typing
with a pencil clenched bet ween his teeth
it is a one room affair with an unmade murphy bed pulled out of the wall at which gillis sits typing
there are a couple of worn out plush chairs and a spanish style wrought iron standing lamp
also a small desk littered with books and letters and a chest of drawers with a portable phonograph and some records on top
on the walls are a couple of repro ductions of characterless paintings with laundry bills and snapshots stuck in the frames
through an archway can he seen a tiny kitchenette complete with unwashed coffee pot and cup empty tin cans orange peels etc
the effect is dingy and cheerless just another furnished apartment
the buzzer sounds
the buzzer sounds again
gillis gets up and opens the door
two men wearing hats stand outside one of them carrying a briefcase
the men ease into the room
hands gillis a business card
weve come for the car
consulting a paper plymouth convertible
calif ornia license n
where are the keys
why should i give you the keys
because the companys played ball with you long enough
because youre three payments behind
and because weve got a court order
come on the keys
or do you want us to jack it up and haul it away
the car isnt here
is that so
i lent it to a friend of mine
he took it up to palm springs
had to get away for his health i suppose
you dont believe me
look in the garage
sure we believe you only now we want you to believe us
that car better be back here by noon tomorrow or theres going to be fireworks
you say the cutest things
the men leave
gillis gillis voice stands pondering beside well i needed about two the door for a moment
hundred and ninety dollars then he walks to the and i needed it real center of the room and quick or id lose my car
with his back to the it wasnt in palm springs camera slips into a and it wasnt in the pair of gray slacks
i was way ahead there is a metallic of the finance company
noise as some loose change and keys drop from the trouser pockets
as gillis bends over to pick them up we see that he has dropped the car keys identifiable be cause of a rabbits foot and a miniature license plate attached
to the key ring
gillis pockets the keys and as he starts to put on a shirt i knew theyd be coming a small shack like build around and i wasnt tak ing it
stands in the ing any chances so i corner of a public park kept it a couple of ing lot
rudy a blocks away in a parking colored boy is giving lot behind rudys shoe a customer a shine
rudy never asked any quest ions
hed just look at your heels and know the score
pan behind the shack to gillis car a yellow plymouth convertible with the top down
gillis enters the shot
he is wearing a tweed sport jacket a tan polo shirt and moooasins
he steps into the car and drives it off
rudy winks after him
i had an original story gillis drives into the kicking around paranount
alley and parks his car my agent told me it was right behind a delivery dead as a doornail
pan and follow i knew a big shot over him as he gets out walks there whod always liked around the corner into me and the time had bronson and
then toward come to take a little the towering main gate of advantage of it
a few loafers name was sheldrake
he studio cops and extras are was a smart producer lounging there
with a set of ulcers to prove it
it is in the style of a paramount executives office mahogany leather and a little chintz
on the walls are some large framed photographs of paramount stars with dedications to mr
also a couple of framed critics awards certificates and an oscar on a bookshelf
a shooting schedule chart is thumb tacked into a large bulletin board
there are piles or scripts a few pipes and somewhere in the background some set models
start on sheldrake
he is about
behind his wor ried face there hides a coated tongue
he is en gaged in changing the stained rilter cigarette in his zeus holder
all right gillis
youve got five minutes
whats your story about
its about a ball player a rookie shortstop thats batting
the poor kid was once mixed up in a hold up
but hes trying to go straight except theres a bunch of gamblers who wont let him
so they tell the kid to throw the world series or else huh
more or less
only for the end ive got a gimmick thats real good
a secretary enters carrying a glass or milk
she opens a drawer and takes out a bottle of pills for sheldrake
got a title
theres a o page outline
to the secretary get the readers department and see what they have on bases loaded
the secretary exits
sheldrake takes a pill and washes it down with some milk
theyre pretty hot about it over at twentieth but i think zanucks all wet
can you see ty power as a gillis contd shortstop
youve got the best man for it right here on this lot
good change of pace for alan ladd
theres another thing its pretty simple to shoot
lot of outdoor stuff
bet you could make the whole thing for under a million
and theres a great little part for bill demarest
one of the trainers an oldtime player who got beaned and goes out of his head sometimes
the door opens and betty schaefer enters a clean cut nice looking girl of with a bright alert manner
dressed in tweed skirt brooks sweater and pearls and carrying a folder of papers
she puts them on sheldrakes desk not noticing gillis who stands near the door
on that bases loaded
i covered it with a page synopsis
she holds it out but i wouldnt bother
whats wrong with it
its from hunger
nothing for ladd
just a rehash of something that wasnt very good to begin with
im sure youll be glad to meet mr
he wrote it
betty turns towards gillis embarrassed
this is miss kramer
and right now i wish i could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me
if i could be of any help
im sorry mr
gillis but i just dont think its any good
i found it flat and banal
exactly what kind of material do you recommend
i just think pictures should say a little something
oh youre one of the message kids
just a story wont do
youd have turned down gone with the wind
no that was me
i said who wants to see a civil war picture
perhaps the reason i hated bases loaded is that i knew your name
id always heard you had some talent
that was last year
this year im trying to earn a living
so you take plot a make it glossy make it slick carefull those are dirty words
you sound like a bunch of new york critics
thank you miss schaefer
next time ill write the naked and the dead
well seems like zanucks got himself a baseball picture
sheldrake i dont want you to think i thought this was going to win any academy award
his mind free wheeling of course were always looking for a betty hutton
do you see it as a betty hutton
amusing himself now wait a minute
if we made it a girls softball team put in a few numbers
might make a cute musical it happened in the bull pen the story of a woman
you trying to be funny
because im all out of laughs
im over a barrel and i need a job
if something should come along along is no good
i need it now
havent got a thing
any kind of assignment
theres nothing gillis
not even if you were a relative
hating it look mr
sheldrake could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself as a personal loan
gillis last year some body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley
so i borrowed money from the bank so i could pay for the ranch
this year i had to mortgage the ranch so i could keep up my life insurance so i could borrow on the insurance so i could pay my income tax
now if dewey had been elected goodbye mr
after that i drove down move in toward drug store to headquarters
thats and the way a lot of us think about schwabs drug store
dissolve to actors and stock girls and waiters
kind of a combination office kaffee a int
schwabs drug store klatsch and waiting room
waiting waiting for the the usual schwabadero gravy train
crowd sits at the fount ain gossips at the cigar stand loiters by the magazine display
move in towards the two telephone booths
in i got myself ten nickels one of them sits gillis and started sending out a stack of nickels in a general s
couldnt front of him
hes get hold of my agent doing a lot of talking naturally
so then i into the telephone called a pal of mine name hanging up dropping of artie green an awful another nickel dialing nice guy an assistant talking again
he cquld let me have twenty but twenty wouldnt do
gillis voice cont
then i talked to a couple of yes men at twentieth
to me they said no
finally i located that agent of mine the big faker
was he out digging up a job for poor joe gillis
he was hard at work in bel air making with the golf clubs
gillis hangs up with a curse opens the door of the booth emerges wiping the sweat from his forehead
he walks toward the exit
he is stopped by the voice of hello gillis
gillis looks around
at the fountain sits skolsky drinking a cup of coffee
got anything for the column
just sold an original for a hundred grand
the life of the warner brothers
starring the ritz brothers
playing opposite the andrew sisters
with a sour smile but dont get me wrong i love hollywood
gillis walks out
on a sun dappled green edged with tall sycamores stands morino the agent a caddy and a nondescript opponent in the background
gillis has evidently stated his problem already
so you need three hundred dollars
of course i could give you three hundred dollars
only im not going to
gillis get this through your head
im not just your agent
its not the ten per cent
im your friend
he sinks his putt and walks toward the next tee gillis following him
hows that about your being my friend
dont you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach
once a talent like yours gets into that mocambo romanoff rut youre through
its the car im talking about
if i lose my car its like having my legs out off
greatest thing that could happen to you
now youll have to sit behind that typewriter
now youll have to write
what do you think ive been doing
i need three hundred dollars
icily maybe what you need is another agent
he bends down to tee up his ball
gillis turns away
driving down sunset as i drove back towards town towards hollywood
he i took inventory of my pros drives slowly
they now added up to mind is working
apparently i just didnt have what it takes and the time had come to wrap up the whole hollywood deal and go home
maybe if i hocked all my junk thered be enough for a bus ticket back to ohio back to that thirty five dollar a week job behind the copy desk
of the dayton evening post if it was still open
back to the smirking delight of the whole office
all gillis stops his car at right you wise guys
why dont a red light by the main you go out and take a crack at entrance to bel air
maybe you think suddenly his eyes fall you could oh oh
on it is a dark green dodge business coupe also waiting for the light to change
but headed in the opposite direction
in it are the two finance company men
they spot gillis in his car and exchange looks
from across the intersection gillis recognizes them and pulls down the leather sunshade to screen his face
as the light changes
gillis gives his car the gun and shoots away
the men narrowly avoid hitting another car as they make a u turn into oncoming traffic and start after him
to a very short very sharp told in flashes
use locations on sunset between bel air and holmby hills
the men lose gillis around a bend catch sight of him and then while they are trapped behind a slow moving truck
he disappears again
he is driving as fast as he dares keeping an eye out for pursuit in his rear view mirror
suddenly his right front tire blows out
gillis clutches desperately at the steering wheel and manages to turn the careening car into it is overgrown with weeds and screened from the street by bushes and trees
gillis stops his car about thirty feet from the street and looks back
was i far enough ahead
shoots past the driveway still looking for gillis
he watches his pursuers gillis voice shoot past and out of yeah
he opens the door and looks down at i had landed myself in the the flat tire
then he driveway of some big mansion looks around to see that looked run down and where he is
at the end of the drive was a lovely sight a driveway with garage indeed a great big empty garage just standing there an enormous five car going to waste
if ever there affair
neglected and was a place to stash away a empty looking
limping car with a hot license number
he gets back into his there was another occupant in car and carefully pilots that garage an enormous the limping vehicle into foreign built automobile
it one of the stalls
in must have burned up ten gallons the adjoining one is a to a mile
it had a large dust covered license
i figured thats isotta fraschini propped when the owners moved out
up on blocks
he closes i also figured i couldnt go the garage door and walks back to my apartment now that up the driveway
in idle those bloodhounds were on to curiosity he mounts a me
the idea was to get artie stone staircase which greens and stay there till i leads to the garden
could make that bus for ohio
camera in back of him
once back in dayton id drop at the top of the steps the credit boys a picturepost he sees the somber pile card telling them where to of pick up
it is a grandiose it was a great big white italianate structure elephant of a place
the kind mottled by the years crazy movie people built in the gloomy forsaken crazy twenties
a neglected little formal garden house gets an unhappy look
completely gone to this one had it in spades
was like that old woman in great expectations that miss from somewhere above haversham in her rotting wed comes ding dress and her torn veil taking it out on the
world be cause shed been given the go by
gillls turns and looks
behind a bamboo blind there is a movement of a dark figure
wlly are you so late
why have you kept me waitlng so long
he stands flabbergasted
a new noise attracts his attention the creak of a heavy metal and glass door being opened
he turns and sees max von mayerling stands there
he is sixty and all in black except for immaculate white cotton gloves shirt high stiff collar and a white bow tie
his coat is shiny black alpaca his trousers ledger atriped
he is semi paralyzed
the left side of his mouth is pulled down and he leans on a rubber ferruled stick
gillis enters the shot
i just put my car in the garage
i had a blow out
i thought go on in
there is authority in the gesture of his white gloved hand as he motions gillis inside
look maybe id better take my car wipe your feet
automatically gillis wipes his feet on an enormous shabby cocoanut mat
you are not dressed properly
dressed for what
have him come up max
gesturing up the stairs
suppose you listen just for a minute madame is waiting
it is grandiose and grim
the whole place is one of those abortions of silent picture days with bowling alleys in the cellar and a built in pipe organ and beams imported from italy with
california termites at work on them
portieres are drawn before all the windows and only thin slits or sunlight find their way in to fight the few electric bulbs which are always burning
gillis starts up the curve of the black marble staircase
it has a wrought iron rail and a worn velvet rope along the wall
from below if you need help with the coffin call me
the oddity of the situation has caught gillis imagination
he climbs the stairs with a kind of morbid fascination
at the top he stops undecided then turns to the right and is stopped by this way
gillis swings around
norma desmond stands down the corridor next to a doorway from which emerges a flickering light
she is a little woman
there is a curious style a great sense of high voltage about her
she is dress ed in black house pyjamas and black high heeled pumps
around her throat there is a leopard pat terned scarf and wound around her head a turban of the same material
her skin is very pale and she is wearing dark glasses
i put him on my massage table in front of the fire
he always liked fires and poking at them with a stick
gillis enters the shot and she leads him into it is a huge gloomy room hung in white brocade which has beconle dirty over the years and even slightly torn
in a few places
theres a great unmade gilded bed in the shape of a swan from which the gold had begun to peel
there is a disorder of clothes and negligees and faded photographs of old time stars about
in an imitation baroque fireplace some logs are burn ing
on the massage table before it lies a small form shrouded under a spanish shawl
at each end on a baroque pedestal stands a three branched cande labrum the candles lighted
ive made up my mind well bury him in the garden
any city laws against that
i wouldnt know
i dont care anyway
i want the coffin to be white
and i want it specially lined with satin
white or deep pink
she picks up the shawl to make up her mind about the color
from under the shawl flops down a dead arm
gillis stares and recoils a little
it is like a childs arm only black and hairy
bright flaming red
lets make it gay
gillis edges closer and glances down
under the shawl he sees the sad bearded face of a dead chimpanzee
norma drops back the shawl
how much will it be
i warn you dont give me a fancy price just because im rich
youve got the wrong man
for the first time
norma really looks at him through her dark glasses
i had some trouble with my car
i pulled into your garage till i could get a spare
i thought this was an empty house
it is not
im sorry and im sorry you lost your friend and i dont think red is the right color
wait a minute havent i seen you
or shall i call my servant
i know your face
youre norma desmond
you used to be in pictures
you used to be big
i am big
its the pictures that got small
i knew there was something wrong with them
there was a time when this busi ness had the eyes of the whole wide world
but that wasnt good enough
oh nol they wanted the ears of the world too
so they opened their big mouths and out came talk talk talk
thats where the popcorn business comes in
you buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears
look at them in the front offices the master minds
they took the idols and smashed them
the fairbankses and the chaplins and the gilberts and the valentinos
and who have they got now
some nobodies a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish poshl dont get sore at me
im not an executive
im just a writer
writing words words
youve made a rope of words and strangled this businessl but there is a microphone right there to catch the last gurgles and technicolor to photograph the red swollen tongue
youll wake up that monkey
gillis starts down the stairs
next time ill bring my autograph album along or maybe a hunk of cement and ask for your footprints
he is halfway down the staircase when he is stopped by just a minute you
youre a writer you said
norma starts down the stairs
are you or arent you
i think thats what it says on my drivers license
and you have written pictures havent you
the last one i wrote was about cattle rustlers
before they were through with it the whole thing played on a torpedo boat
norma has reached him at the bottom of the staircase
i want to ask you something
come in here
she leads him into it is dark and damp and filled with black oak and red velvet furniture which looks like crappy props from the mark of zorro set
along the main wall a gigantic fireplace has been freezing for years
on the gold piano is a galaxy of photographs of norma desmond in her various roles
on one wall is a painting a california gold rush scene carthay circle school
we will learn later that it hides a motion picture screen
one corner is filled with a large pipe organ and as norma and gillis enter there is a grizzly moaning sound
gillis looks around
the wind gets in that blasted pipe organ
i ought to have it taken out
or teach it a better tune
norma has led him to the card tables which stand side by side near a window
they are piled high with papers scrawled in a large uncertain hand
how long is a movie script these days
i mean how many pages
depends on what it is a donald duck or joan or arc
this is to be a very important picture
i have written it myself
took me years
looking at the piles of script looks like enough for six impor tant pictures
its the story or salome
i think ill have demille direct it
weve made a lot of pictures together
and youll play salome
i didt know you were planning a comeback
i hate that word
it is a return
a return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen
salome what a woman
what a part
the princess in love with a holy man
she dances the dance of the seven veils
he rejects her so she demands his head on a golden tray kissing his cold dead lips
theyll love it in pomona
taking it straight they will love it every place
she reaches for a batch of pages from the heap read it
read the scene just before she has him killed
never let another writer read your stuff
he may steal it
i am not afraid
norma contd calling max
to gillis sit down
is there enough light
ive got twenty twenty vision
max has entered
bring something to drink
norma turns to gillis again
i said sit down
there is compulsion in her voice
gillis looks at her gillis voice and starts slowly well
i had no pressing reading
engagement and shed men tioned something to drink
max comes in wheeling sometimes its interesting a wicker tea wagon on to see just how bad bad which are two bottles o writing can be
this prom f champagne and two ised to go the limit
i red venetian glasses wondered what a handwriting a box of zwieback and expert would make of that a jar of caviar
norma childish scrawl of hers
sits on her feet
deep max wheeled in some champagne in a chair a gold ring and some caviar
later i on her forefinger with found out that max was the a clip which holds a only other person in that cigarette
she gets up grim sunset castle and i and forces on gillis found out a few other things another batch of script about him
as for her she goes back to her chair
sat coiled up like a watch spring her cigarette clamped in a curious holder
i could sense her eyes on me from behind those dark glasses defying me not to like what i read or maybe begging me in her own proud way to
it meant so much to her
ceiling it sure was a cozy set up
that bundle of raw nerves and pan down to the moan max and a dead monkey upstair ing organ
pan over and the wind wheezing through to the entrance door
that organ once in a while
max opens it and a later on just for comedy solemn faced man in relief the real guy arrived undertakers clothes with a baby coffin
it was brings in a small all done with great dignity
thru he must have been a very these shots the room important chimp
the great has been growing grandson of king kong maybe
a gillis it got to be eleven
i was feeling a little sick at my reading
the lamp stomach what with that sweet beside him is now champagne and that tripe id really paying its been reading that silly way in the dark room
hodgepodge of melodramatic a lot of the manu plots
however by then id script pages are started concocting a little piled on the floor plot of my own
around his feet
a half empty champagne glass stands on the arm of his chair
the camera slowly draws back to include norma desmond sitting in the dusk just as she was before
gillis puts down a batch of script
there is a little pause
this is fascinating
of course it is
maybe its a little long and maybe there are some repetitions
but youre not a professional writer
i wrote that with my heart
sure you did
thats what makes it great
what it needs is a little more dialogue
i can say anything i want with my eyes
it certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil
i will not have it butchered
of course not
but it ought to be organized
just an editing job
you can find somebody
id have to have somebody i can trust
when were you born i mean what sign of the zodiac
i dont know
december twenty first
i like sagittarians
you can trust them
i want you to do this work
just finished one script
im due on another assignment
i dont care
you know im pretty expensive
i get five hundred a week
i wouldnt worry about money
ill make it worth your while
maybe id better take the rest of the script home and read it oh no
i couldnt let it out of my house
youll have to finish it here
its getting kind of late are you married mr
the name is gillis
where do you live
the alto nido apart ments
theres something wrong with your car you said
there sure is
you can stay here
ill come early tomorrow
norma takes off her glasses
theres room over the garage
max will take you there
toward normas face she sure could say a lot of right up to her things with those pale eyes of eyes
theyd been her trade mark
theyd made her the num ber one vamp of another era
i remember a rather florid des cription in an old fan magazine which said her eyes are like two moonlit waterholes where strange animals come to drink
ing to room over garage i felt kind of pleased with the way id handled the sit max an electric light uation
id dropped the hook bulb in his hand is and shed snapped at it
now leading gillis up
my car would be safe down gillis carries a batch below while i did a patch of the manuscript
up job on the script
and there should be plenty of money in it
max pushes open a door at the top of the stairs
opening the door i made your bed this afternoon
on second thought how did you know i was going to stay this afternoon
max doesnt answer
he walks across to the bed screws a bulb in the open socket above it
the light goes on revealing there are dirty windows on two sides and dingy wall paper on the cracked plaster walls
for furniture there is a neatly made bed a table and a few chairs which might have been discarded from the main house
this room has not been used for a long time
it will never make house beautiful
i guess its o
for one night
max gives him an enigmatic look
pointing there is the bathroom
i put in soap and a toothbrush
he starts taking off his coat say shes quite a character that norma desmond
she was the greatest
you wouldnt know
you are too young
in one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters
men would bribe her mani curist to get clippings from her fingernails
there was a maharajah who came all the way from hyderabad to get one of her stockings
later he strangled himself with it
i sure turned into an interesting driveway
you did sir
he goes out
gillis i pegged him as slightly looks after him hangs cuckoo too
a stroke maybe
his coat over a chair come to think of it the walks over to the win whole place seemed to have dow pulls down the been stricken with a kind
of rickety venetian blind
creeping paralysis out of as he does so he looks beat with the rest of the down at world crumbling apart in slow motion
the desmond house there was a tennis court or moonlight rather the ghost of a tennis court with faded markings the cement surface is and sagging net
cracked in many places and weeds are growing high
he looks away from the court to there is no water in and of course she had a pool
it and hunks of who didnt then
mabel norm mosaic which lines its and and john gilbert must enormous basin are have swum in it ten thousand broken away
midnights ago and vilma banky and rod la roque
it was empty now
or was it
he stares down his stomach slowly turning
at the bottom of the basin a great rat is eating a decaying or ange
from the inlet pipe crawl two other rats who join battle with the first rat over the orange
he starts away but some gillis voice thing attracts his atten there was something tion
he turns back and else going on below looks down again
the last rites for that hairy old chimp performed with the a the lawn below utmost seriousness as if she were laying norma desmond and max are to rest an
carrying the white coffin was her life really towards a small grave as as empty as that
which has been dug in the dead turf
norma carries one of the candelabra all of its candles flickering in the wind
they reach the grave and lower the coffin into it
then norma lighting his task with the candelabrum max takes a spade from the loose earth and starts filling in the grave
he watches the scene be gillis voice low then turns into the it was all very queer room goes to the door but queerer things to lock it
there is no were yet to come
key and only a hole where the lock has been gouged out
gillis moves a heavy overstuffed chair in front of the door then walks towards the bed throws himself on it picking up some of the manuscript pages to read
the day is overcast
the sound distant organ house is shrouded in low music improvisations fog
on an odd mournful theme not too loud continuing throughout b the tennis court blurred the scene
over with fog
its dark outline even more melancholy under the misty blanket
muted daylight seeps gillis voice through the blinds
gillis that night id had a lies on the bed under a mixed up dream
in it shabby quilt
the manu was an organ grinder
script is beside him some i couldnt see his of the pages scattered on face but the organ the floor
he is just was all draped in opening his eyes
it takes black and a chimp was him a moment to adjust him dancing for pennies
self to the strange sur when i opened my eyes roundings
his eyes wander the music was still ing about the room
where was stop startled
he lifts i
himself on one elbow and stares at the heavy chair he had set oh yes in that empty against it the night before room over her garage
has been pushed back
the only it wasnt empty door is wide ajar
somebody had brought in all my belongings my b gillis books my typewriter my clothes
he jumps out of bed
he wears shirt trousers and socks
suddenly he realizes that all his possessions have gillis voice been brought in
in what was going on
the closet hang his shirts
his books and typewriter are neatly arranged on the table
his phonograph radio combination is all installed
gillis looks around startled then sits down and starts putting on his moccasins hastily
pull back they belong to max von mayerling
he is sitting erect his bull neck taut as a wrestlers as he rights out somber chord after somber chord
he sits in a shaft of gray light coming from an open french window
through the far archway gillis storms into the big room
hey you max whatever your name is what are my things doing here
im talking to you
my clothes and things are up in the room
i brought them myself
furiously is that so
why are you so upset
is there anything missing
who said you could
who asked you to
norma desmonds shadow moves into the shaft of light
gillis looks around
on the couch by the fireplace reclines norma desmond dressed in a negligee
i dont know why you should be so upset
stop that playing max
to gillis again it seemed like a good idea if we are to work together
look im supposed to fix up your script
theres nothing in the deal about my staying here
youll like it here
thanks for the invitation but i have my own apartment
you cant work in an apartment where you owe three months rent
ill take care of that

well deduct it from my salary
now now dont lets be small about such matters
we wont keep books
to max go on unpack mr
i didnt say i was staying
her glasses off again suppose you make up your mind
do you want this job or dont you
gillis sits at an impro so i let him unpack my vised table his typewriter things
i wanted the in front of him working dough and i wanted to hard at the manuscript
get out of there as pencils shears and a quickly as possible
paste pot at hand
i thought if i really got going i could toss facing him at some dis it off in a couple or tance sits norma dressed weeks
but it wasnt in another version of her so simple getting some favorite lounging pajamas coherence into that wild the cigaette contraption scrambled melodrama on her finger
she is shed concocted
what autographing large photo made it tougher was that graphs of herself and put she was around all the ting them in envelopes
time hovering over me afraid id do injury to that precious brain child of hers
gillis takes two or three pages from normas hand written script crosses them out and puts them to one side
norma rises crosses towards gillis looks over his shoulder
just a scene i cut out
the one where you go to the slave market
you can cut right to the scene where john the baptist cut away from me
honestly its a little old hat
they dont want that any more
then why do they still write me fan letters every day
why do they beg me for my photo graphs
because they want to see me me me
he pulls the page from his typewriter
as he does so he glances over towards norma
on the table in front i didnt argue with her
of her are the photo you dont yell at a graphs which she is sign sleepwalker he may fall ing
on the long table and break his neck
thats in the living room is a it she was still gallery of photographs sleepwalking along the in various frames all giddy heights of a lost norma desmond
on the career plain crazy piano more photographs
when it came to that one above the piano an oil subject her celluloid portrait of her
on the self the great norma highboy beside him still desmond
how could she more photographs
breathe in that house so crowded with norma dissolve to desmonds
more norma desmond and still more norma desmond
shooting towards the big it wasnt all work of gold rush painting
two or three white gloves and all times a week max would steps into the shot shoves haul up that enormous oil the painting up towards painting that had been
the ceiling revealing a presented to her by some motion picture screen
nevada chamber of com max exits
merce and wed see a movie right in her living room
they sit on a couch facing so much nicer than going the screen
on a table in out shed say
the front of them are champagne plain fact was that she cigarettes and coffee
was afraid of that world above their heads are the outside
afraid it typical openings for a pro would remind her that jector
the lights go off
time had passed
from the opening above their heads shoots the wide beam of light
b max in the projection they were silent movies booth behind the room and max would run the projection machine which the light of the machine was just as well
it flickering over his face kept him from giving us which is frozen a somber an accompaniment on enigma
that wheezing organ
shed sit very close to watching the screen
me and shed smell of gillis looks down and sees tuberoses which is not that normas hand is clasp my favorite perfume not ing his ann tight
he by a long shot
sometines doesnt like it much but as we watched shed c he cant do anything about lutch my arm or my hand it
when she for forgetting she was my a second lets go his arm employer becoming just a to pick up a glass of fan excited about that champagne he gently
with actress up there on the draws his arm leans away screen
i guess i dont from her and crosses his have to tell you who the arms to discourage any star was
they were resumption of her approach
always her pictures norma puts the glass down thats all she wanted doesnt find his arn but to see
is not aware of any signifi cance in his maneuver
they both watch the screen
on it flickers a famous scene from one of normas old silent pictures
it is not to be a funny scene
it is old fashioned but shows her incredible beauty and the screen presence which made her the great star of her day
still wonderful isnt it
and no dialogue
we didnt need dialogue
we had faces
there just arent any faces like that any more
well maybe one garbo
in a sudden flareup she jumps to her feet and stands in the flickering beam of light
those idiot producers
havent they got any eyes
have they forgotten what a star looks like
ill show them
ill be up there again
so help me
it is apparently empty
gillis voice the elaborate lamps sometimes thered be a make pools of light
little bridge game in the house at a twentieth of the camera pulls back a cent a point
id get and pans to reveal a half her winnings
once card table around they ran up to seventy which sit norma and cents which was about three friends three the only cash money i actors of her period
the others they sit erect and play around the table would with grim seriousness
be actor friends dim figures you may still beside norma sits remember from the silent gillis kibitzing on a days
i used to think of game which bores him them as her wax works
an ashtray on the card table is full and norma holds it out for gillis to take away
he crosses the room to the fire place
but his eyes fall on the entrance door and he stops
max stands in the open door
outside are the two men who came to the apartment for gillis car
he steps back so that he cannot be seen from the door
a second later max appears looking for him
quietly some men are here
they asked for you
im not here
thats what i told them
they found your car in the garage
they are going to tow it away
gillis doesnt know what to do
from offstage comes the ashtray joe dear
can we have the ashtray
gillis dumps the cigarette butts into the cold fire place crosses to the bridge table puts the ashtray down leans over and speaks into normas ear
i want to talk to you for a minute
not now my dear
im playing three no trump
theyve come for my car
now ive forgotten how many spades are out
i need some money right now
cant you wait till im dummy
angry by now please
gillis stands frustrated hideously embarrassed by the stares of the waxworks
he turns away and hurries to the door
it is half open
gillis comes into the shot and taking cover looks out
the men from the finance company are cranking up the car
max stands watching silently
when they finish the cranking job the men climb into the front seat of the truck
over the shot the sound of the truck being started and the cars moving away
gillis moves out into the courtyard and stands staring after the car
from the house comes norma
now what is it
wheres the fire
ive lost my car
and i thought it was a matter of life and death
it is to me
thats why i came to this house
thats why i took this job ghost writing
now youre being silly
we dont need two cars
we have a car
and not one of thuse cheap new things made of chromium and spit
an isotta fraschini
have you ever heard of isotta fraschinis
all hand made
cost me twenty eight thousand dollars
the camera has panned over to the garage and focuses on the dirty isotta fraschini on its blocks
max is at the wheel gillis voice dressed as usual except so max got that old bus for a chauffeurfs cap
down off its blocks and polished it up
shed take me for rides in the b inside the car hills above sunset
gillis sits beside norma the whole thing was up who is wearing a smart holstered in leopard tailleur and her eternal skin and had one of sun glasses
gillis those car phones all wears his sport jacket gold plated
flannel trousers moccasin combination
he sits uncomfortably
norma is studying him
thats a dreadful shirt youre wearing
whats wrong with it
nothing if you work in a fill ing station
and im getting rather bored with that sport jacket and those same baggy pants
she picks up the car phone max whats a good mens shop in town
the very best
well go there
i dont need any clothes and i certainly dont want you buy ing them for why begrudge me a little fun
i just want you to look nice my stray little boy
by this time max has made a u turn
gillis stands in front of a full length triple mirror surrounded by a couple of salesmen and the tailor who is busily working out alterations
gillis wears a double breasted gray flannel coat with chalk stripes
his trousers belong to another suit of glen plaid
norma is running the show
theres nothing like gray flannel with a chalk stripe
she points at the trousers this one single breasted of course
to another salesman now we need a topcoat
lets see what you have in camels hair
the salesman leaves
how about some evening clothes
i dont need a tuxedo
of course you do
a tuxedo and tails
youll need them for parties
youll need them for new years eve
to a salesman where are your evening clothes
this way madame
he leads her off
the other salesman arrives with a selection of topcoats
here are some camel hairs but id like you just to feel this one
of course its a little more expensive
a camels hair will do
with an insulting inflection as long as the lady is paying for it why not take the vicuna
a day in december
water is drizzling from gillis voice two or three spots in the the last week in december ceiling into pans and the rains came a great bowls set to catch
it big package of rain
one bowl right on the over sized like every bed
the room is almost thing else in california
emptied of gillis be longings by now
max it came right through is carrying out a hand the old roof of my room full of new suits on above the garage
he has a had max move me to the dressing gown over his main house
i didnt shoulder
gillis holds much like the idea the a stack of shirts his only time i could have typewriter and some to myself was in that manuscript
he surveys room but it was better the room for the last than sleeping in a rain time to see whether coat and galoshes
hes forgotten any thing
he puts down the typewriter and picks up from under the bed a pair of very smart red leather bedroom slippers
he tucks them under his arm picks up the typewriter and leaves
c a bedroom in tiie main house it is obviously a mans room heavy spanish furniture one wall nothing but a closet with shelves and drawers for shirts and shoes
max is hanging up the suits
gillis throws the shirts on a big chair tosses the slippers at the foot of the bed places the typewriter and manuscript on a desk at the window
whose room was this
it was the room of the husband
or of the husbands i should say
madame has been married three times
slightly embarrassed gillis picks up his toilet kit with razor toothbrushes soap etc
and starts towards the bathroom pausing en route at a rain splattered window
i guess this is the one you can see catalina from
only this isnt the day
he proceeds towards the half opened door leading to the bathroom
something strikes his attention and he stops
as in the door to the room above the garage this lock too has been gouged out
hey whats this with the door
there isnt any lock
there are no locks anywhere in this house
he points to the entrance door of the room and to another door
the doctor suggested it
she has moments of melancholy
there have been some suicide attempts
we have to be very careful
no sleeping pills no razor blades
we shut off the gas in her bed room
she got enough out of it
shes not forgotten
she still gets those fan letters
i wouldnt look too closely at the postmarks
you send them
is that it max
id better press your evening clothes sir
you have not for gotten madames new years party
no i havent
i suppose all the waxworks are coming
i dont know sir
madame made the arrangements
gillis comes out of the bathroom picks up his shirts goes over to a closet opens it
as he does so one of the doors without a lock swings slightly open
gillis looks through the half open door and sees
it is empty
the rainy gillis voice day does nothing to there it was again that help its gloom
room of hers all satin and ruffles and that bed like a gilded rowboat
the per fect setting for a silent movie queen
poor devil still waving proudly to a parade which had long since passed her by
he pushes the door shut and walks back into the room
gillis is coming down the gillis voice stairs in his tailcoat it was at her new years adjusting the handkerchief party that i found out in his pocket
he obviously how she felt about me
feels a little uneasy in maybe id been an idiot this outfit
from below not to have sensed it comes a tango of the twen was coming that sad ties
played by a small embarrassing revelation
gillis stops in the archway leading to the big room and looks around
c the big room has been deco rated for the occasion with laurel garlands
dozens of candles in all the sconces and candelabra are ablaze
their flickering flames are reflected in the waxed sur face of the tile floor
there is a buffet with buckets of champagne and caviar on ice
in one corner on a little platform banked with palms
a four piece orchestra is playing
at the buffet are max and norma
she is drinking a glass of champagne
she is wearing a diamonte evening dress
very high style
with long black gloves and a headdress of paradise feathers
her eyes fall on gillis
she puts down the glass of champagne
picks up a gardenia boutonniere and moves toward him
joe you look absolutely divine
gillis makes a slow o degree turn
and i love that line
she indicates the v from his shoulders to his hips
dont let it fool you
she puts the gardenia on his lapel
you know to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit
i dont like those studs theyve sent
i want you to have pearls
nice big pearls
now im not going to wear ear rings i can tell you that
lets have some drinks
she leads him over to the buffet
shouldnt we wait for the others
pointing at the floor careful its slippery
i had it waxed
they reach the buffet
max is ready with two glasses of champagne
norma hands gillis a glass
heres to us
you know this floor used to be wood but i had it changed
valentino said there is nothing like tiles for a tango
she opens her arms
not on the same floor with valentino
just follow me
they start to tango
after a moment dont bend back like that
its those feathers
norma pulls the paradise feathers from her hair and tosses them away
as they play the tango the musicians eye the danc ing couple take in the situation exchange glances and turn away with professional discretion
gillis glances at his wrist watch
its a quarter past ten
what time are they supposed to get here
the other guests
there are no other guests
we dont want to share this night with other people
this is for you and me
i understand some rich guy bought up all the tickets for a perfor mance at the metropolitan and sat there listening to la traviata all by himself
he was afraid of catching cold
hold me tighter
come midnight how about blind folding the orchestra and smash ing champagne glasses on maxs head
you think this is all very funny
is it funny that im in love with you
im in love with you
dont you know that
ive been in love with you all along
they dance on
gillis is acutely embarrassed
the camera slowly pulls back pans past the faces of the musicians who play on with a rather overe mphasized lack of interest
finally it winds up on max behind the buffet
he stands watching gillis a faint trace of pity in his eyes
cigarette gadget as she gillis voice inserts a cigarette
im sure a lot of you will laugh about this
ridicu lous situation wasnt it
a woman almost twice my age
it got to be about a quarter of eleven
i felt caught like a cig arette in the prongs of that contraption on her finger
norma and gillis sitting on a couch in front of the cavernous fireplace
norma holds out her cigarette to gillis who lights it
what a wonderful next year its going to be
what fun were going to have
iii fill the pool for you
or ill open my house in malibu and you can have the whole ocean
or ill buy you a boat and well sail to hawaii
you arent going to buy me anything more
dont be silly
she reaches under a pillow of the couch and brings out a leather box here
i was going to give it to you at midniglht
gillis opens the box
it contains a matched gold cigarette case and lighter
read whats inside
gillis snaps open the case
engraved inside the cover is to joe from norma and two bars of music
what are the notes
mad about the boy
norma i cant take it
youve bought me enough
im richer than all this new hollywood trash
ive got a million dollars
i own three blocks downtown
i have oil in bakersfield pumping pumping pumping
whats it for but to buy us anything we want
cut out that us business
whats the matter with you
what right do you have to take me for granted
do you want me to tell you
has it ever occurred that i may have a life of my own
that there may be some girl im crazy about
some car hop or a dress extra
what im trying to say is that im all wrong for you
you want a valentino somebody with polo ponies a big shot getting up slowly what youre trying to say is that you dont want me to love you
is that it
gillis doesnt answer
norma slaps his face and rushes from the room and upstairs
gillis stands paralyzed the slap burning his cheek
norma rushes up the last few steps down the corridor and into her bedroom banging the door
move the camera toward the closed door centering on the gouged out lock
he still stands motionless
he glances around fur tively to see if his humiliation has been observed
the musicians are playing away
they have turned their eyes away from gillis rather too ostentatious ly for comfort
his eyes move over toward he is subtler than the musicians
he appears very busy at the buffet putting empty bottles and used glasses on a tray
he walks across the room with them
he starts slowly out
as he does so his long gold key chain catches on a carved ornament of the sofa and holds him for a second of additional embarrass ment
he yanks it loose and walks with as much nonchalance as he can muster to crossing towards the coat closet gillis throws a look upstairs
then he pulls the vicuna coat from its hangar and slips into it as he crosses to the entrance door
he opens the door on the darkness of the courtyard
gillis shuts the door
gillisvoice he takes a few steps i didnt know where i was forward then stands going
i just had to get for a while breathing out of there
i had to be deep
the rain is with people my own age
i balm to that cheek had to hear somebody laugh where the slap still a again
i thought of artie burns
he walks for green
there was bound to ward with a great be a new years shindig sense of relief
going on in his apartment down on las palmas the hock shop set not a job c driveway leading to in the room
but lots of fun on the cuff
gillis walks to the street which is dark and empty
he starts down sunset in an easterly direction
a car passes
he tries to thumb a ride without success
however the second car a florists delivery wagon stops
gillis jumps in and the car drives off
it is the most modest one room affair jam packed with young people flowing over into the miniature bathroom and the microscopic kitchenette
the only drink being served is punch from a pressed glass bowl but everybody is having a hell of a time
most of the men are in slacks and sweaters and only a few of the girls in something that vaguely suggests party dress
abe burroughs sits at a small guest festooned piano and sings tokio rose
by the door a group of young men and girls respond to the song by sing ng rinso white or dentyne chewing gum or something similar in the manner of
a bach choral
artie green a dark haired pleasant looking guy in his late twenties is conducting with the ladle from the punch bowl
the door behind some of the singers is pushed open jostling them out of their places
in comes gillis his hair and face wet the collar of his vicuna coat turned up
artie stops conducting but the commer cial goes right on
well what do you know
where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours
in a deep freeze
i almost reported you to the bureau of missing persons
to the company fans you all know joe gillis the well known screen writer opium smuggler and black dahlia suspect
gillis greets some of the kids by name as he and artie push their way into the room
give me your coat
let it ride for a while
youre going to stay arent you
that was the general idea
artie starts peeling the coat off gillis
its texture takes his breath away
what is this mink
he has taken the coat
he looks at gillis standing there in tails
priest who did you borrow that from
close but no cigar
gillis stands embarrassed while artie rolls up the vicuna coat and tucks it above the books on a book shelf
say youre not really smuggling opium these days are you
wheres the bar
the two make their way toward the punch bowl
its a little like running the gauntlet for gillis
there are whistles and stares of astonishlnent at his tails
when they reach the punch bowl artie picks up a half filled glass and fills it
they call me the elsa maxwell of the assistant directors
to some guests who are dipping their empty cups into the punch bowl hey easy on the punch bowl
budget only calls for three drinks per extra
fake the rest
listen artie can i stick around here for a while
sure thisll go on all night
i mean could you put me up for a couple of weeks
it just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch
ill take it
ill have the bell hop take care of your luggage
he runs his finger across the decollete back of a girl standing in a group next them
just register here
the girl turns around
she is betty schaefer
you know each other
gillis looks at her a little puzzled
let me help you
betty schaeter sheldrakes office
wait a minute
this is the woman i love
whats going on
who was loaded
shes just a fan for my literary output
to artie hurt feelings department
about that luggage
wheres the phone
over by the rainbow room
gillis squeezes his way through groups of people to the telephone which is next to an open door leading to the bathroom
the phone is busy
a girl sits listening to it giggling wildly
another girl beside her is laughing too
they are apparently sharing a conversation with some man on the other end of the wire
the telephone passes from hand to hand
gillis watches impatiently then when youlre through with that thing can i have it
the girl just nods going on with her chattering
gillis stands waiting and betty schaefer comes up with his glass
you forgot this
ive been hoping to run into you
to recover that knife you stuck in my back
i felt a little guilty so i got out some of your old stories
why you sweet kid
theres one called
something with a window
how did you like it
except for about six pages
youve got a flashback there
there is too much racket for her
is there someplace we can talk
how about the rainbow room
they squeeze their way towards the bathroom past artie
i said you could have my couch
i didnt say you could have my girl
this is shop talk
she and gillis go through the open door into its a little less noisy although there are some guests there chatting and having fun
betty and gillis sit down on the edge of the tub
now if i got you correctly there was a short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice
the flashback in the courtroom when she tells about being a school teacher
i had a teacher like that once
maybe thats why its good
its true its moving
now why dont you use that character
who wants true
who wants moving
drop that attitude
heres some thing really worth while
want me to start right now
maybe theres some paper around
ive got a few ideas
ive got some ideas myself
one of them being this is new years eve
how about living it up a little
as for instance
we could make some paper boats and have a regatta
or should we just turn on the shower
how about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door
are you hungry
after twelve years in the burmese jungle
i am starving lady agatha starving for a white shoulder phillip youre mad
one of the girls who was on the phone comes to the door
you can have the phone now
paying no attention thirsting for the coolness of your lips no phillip no
we must be strong
youre still wearing the uniform of the coldstream guards
furthermore you can have the phone now
he gets up starts out turns i find im terribly afraid of losing you
she takes the glass out of his hand ill get us a refill of this awful stuff
youll be waiting for me
with a wildly beating heart
life can be beautiful
gillis squeezes himself through some guests to the phone
he has to stand in a cramped position holding the instrument close to him as he dials a number
this is mr
i want you to do me a favor
max is at the phone in the lower hall
i am sorry mr
i cannot talk now
yes you can
i want you to get my old suitcase and i want you to throw in my old clothes the ones i came with and my typewriter
ill have somebody pick them up
i have no time to talk
the doctor is here
whats going on
she got the razor from your room
she cut her wrists
max hangs up moves toward the staircase
he hangs up the dead receiver stands numb with shock
betty elbows her way up to him carrying the two punch glasses filled again
i just got the recipe take two packages of cough drops dissolve in one gallon of lukewarm grape juice gillis looks up at her
without a word he pushes her aside so that she spills the drink
he makes his way through the guests to the vicuna coat pulls it from the shelf some books tumbling with it and rushes towards the door and out
betty stands look ing after him completely bewildered
the doctors car is parked in the driveway
a taxi pulls up
gillis in his vicuna coat now jumps out throws a couple of dollars to the rdriver and runs toward the house
c a doorway norma desmond house max is opening the door to let out the doctor a professional looking man carrying a black bag
gillis runs into the shot
how is she
she is upstairs
gillis starts to push past max
max grabs his arm
do not race up the stairs
the musicians must not know what has happened
gillis goes into the house
gillis crosses the hall and starts up the stairs
only one alabaster lamp lights the big cold room
on the bed lies norma in her evening dress
she is white as a sheet
her wrists are bandaged
her eyes are wide open staring at the ceiling
one of her shoes has halt slipped off her foot
the other is on
gillis opens the door and stands there tor a second
then he slowly moves to the toot of the bed
he takes the shoes from her feet and puts them on the floor
what kind of a silly thing was that to do
to fall in love with you that was the idiotic thing
it sure would have made attractive headlines great star kills her self for unknown writer
great stars have great pride
she puts one bandaged forearm over her eyes sobbing
gillis walks slowly over to the mantelpiece stands there for awhile
go to that girl of yours
look i was making that up because i thought the whole thing was a mistake
i didnt want to hurt you
youve been good to me
youre the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me
why dont you just say thank you and go go go not until you promise to act like a sensible human being
ill do it again ill do it again ill do it again
gillis stands looking at her helplessly
the candles burned down the orchestra playing to the emptiness
the orchestra leader looks at his watch rises silences the orchestra then starts them in on auld lang syne
gillis still stands
norma lies on the bed arms over her eyes sobbing
happy new year
norma continues to sob
gillis goes to the bed puts his arms on her shoulders and turns her around
happy new year
norma looks at him tears in her eyes
slowly she enfolds him in her bandaged arms
happy new year
she kisses him

d e patio normas house it is a sunny day
the garden is in somewhat better shape
the old house looks less unkept
the pool is filled
norma sits on a wicker chaise longue her face shielded by an enormous straw hat her eyes by dark glasses
gillis in bathing trunks is on a rubber mattress in the pool
max comes to the entrance door
somebody inqu iring about a stray dog
we must have a number very similar to the pound
he starts to turn back
wait a minute
i want you to get out the car
youre going to take the script over to paramount and deliver it to mr
de mille in person
he goes into the house
climbing out of the water youre really going to send it to de mille
this is the right day
she indicates a typewritten letter she is holding
norma contd the chart from my astrologer
she read demilles horoscope
she read mine
did she read the script
demille is leo
mars has been transmitting jupiter for weeks
today is the day of greatest conjuction
now turn around
let me dry you
she puts the towel around his sholders and starts drying him
i hope you realize norma that scripts dont sell on astrologers charts
im not just selling the script
im selling me
demille always said i was his greatest star
when did he say it norma
so he said it quite a few years ago
i never looked better in my life

because ive never been as happy in my life
she kisses him
a few evenings later we max is driving

they make me cough
pushing open the glass partition to max pull up at the drugstore will you max

youre a darling
she takes a dollar bill from her purse and gives it to him
the car drives up and gillis hurries into the store
business is still rather lively
there are about a dozen shoppers and the soda counter is half filled
gillis enters and steps to the tobacco counter
to the salesgirl give me a pack of those turkish cigarettes melachrinos
the girl opens the glass showcase to locate the fancy brand
from off comes stick em up gillis or ill let you have it
artie green and betty schaefer sit having a sandwich and a milk shake
with his forefinger and a sound effect artie riddles gillis body
gillis walks hello artie
good evening miss schaefer
excitedly you dont know how glad i am to see youl walking out on the mob
whats the big idea
im sorry about new years
would you believe me if i said i had to be with a sick friend
someone in the formal set no doubt with a ten carat kidney stone
stop it artie will you
to gillis where have you been keeping your self
ive got the most wonderful news for you
i havent been keeping myself at all
i called your agent
i called the screen writers guild
finally your old apartment gave me some crestview number
there was always somebody with an accent growling at me
you were not there
you were not to be spoken to
they never heard of you
is that so
whats the wonderful news
sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher
i got him all hopped up about it
he thinks it could be made into something
into something for barbara stan wyck
they have a commitment with barbara stanwyck
unless youd rather have sarah bernhardt
this is on the level
sheldrake really went for it
wheres the cash
wheres the story
i bluffed it out with a few notions of my own
its really just a springboard
it needs work
i was afraid of that
ive got twenty pages of notes
ive got a pretty good character for the man

norma was getting bored she peeks out from one would put on a live show side of the parasol for me the norma desmond a bandanna tied follies
her first number around her head with was always the mack sennett a rabbits ear bow
she bats her eyes winks roguishly
the camera pulls back to reveal that normas black pyjama trousers are rolled up over her knees and her black stockings rolled down below them
the whole effect approximates a mack sennett bathing costume pretty effectively
she points at a leather pour
this is a rock
she climbs on it pantomimes timidity an attempted dive then jumps off
gillis lolls on a couch watching the performance very bored
i can still see myself in the line bebe daniels marie prevost mabel normand
mabel was always stepping on my feet

lighting a cigarette with a match nothing is the matter

i need it for a moustache
now close your eyes
she runs out of the gillis voice picture
gillis has something was the matter closed his eyes
i was thinking the camera moves to about that girl of arties his face
that miss schaefer
she was so like all us writers when we first hit holly wood itching with am bition panting to get your names up there screenplay by
original story by
audiences dont know somebody sits down and writes a picture
they think the actors make it up as they go along
open your eyes
gillis opens his eyes
norma has equipped herselr with a derby hat a cane and blacked in a small moustache
she goes into a little chaplin routine
while she is doing it the telephone rings
after a moment max comes to the living room door
madame is wanted on the telephone
you know better than to interrupt me
paramount is calling
to gillis now now do you belive me
i told you demille would jump at it
it is not mr
demille in person
it is someone by the name or gordon cole
he says its very important
certainly its important
its important enough for mr
demille to call me personally
the idea of having an assistant call me
i myself was surprised at mr
de milles manners
say that im busy and hang up
very good madam
he bows and exits
how do you like that
weve made twelve pictures together
his greatest successes
maybe demille is shooting
i know that trick
he wants to belittle me
hes trying to get my price down
ive waited twenty years for this call
demille can wait till im good and ready
she is in full makeup gillis voice with a veil a daring about three days later she hat a suit so stunning was good and ready
in only she would venture credible as it may seem to wear it
the camera there had been some more pulls back
beside her of those calls from sits gillis in the glen paramount
so she put on plaid suit
max is about half a pound of driving
makeup fixed it up with a veil and set forth to see demille in person
norma is examining her face in the mirror of her vanity
max while driving sees her in the rear view mirror
if you will pardon me madame
the shadow over the left eye is not quite balanced
thank you max
with a handkerchief she corrects it
the car drives down bronson and stops smack in front of the iron gate
a young policeman is talking to an extra an old policeman sits reading a newspaper
max sounds the horn impatiently
hold that noise
to see mr
open the gate
demille is shooting
you got an appointment
no appointment is necessary
i am bringing norma desmond
norma has rolled down the window on her side
she calls to the old policeman
come here jonesy
he comes forward slowly why if it isnt miss desmond
how have you been miss desmond
now open that gate
sure miss desmond
to the young policeman come on mac
they cant drive on the lot without a pass
miss desmond can
they fling open the gate
as the car drives through stage eighteen miss desmond
thank you jonesy
and teach your friend some manners
tell him without me he wouldnt have any job because without me there wouldnt be any paramount studio
to max go on
they drive through the gates
the old policeman goes to wall phone beside the gate dials a number
into phone norma desmond coming in to see mr
a scene from sampson and delilah is being rehearsed in the background
the usual turbulent activity surrounds it extras
makeup men grips assistants etc
in the dim foreground a stage hand is answering a stand telephone
he puts down the phone and moves camera with him to a second assistant
norma desmond is coming to see mr
the second assistant walks camera with him to the first assistant
nd assistant norma desmond coming in to see mr
the first assistant camera with him hurries to the set
sitting with his back toward us is c
he is rehearsing a scene with hedy lamarr
norma desmond is coming in to see you mr
turns his head
lst assistant she must be a million years old
i hate to think where that puts me
i could be her father
im terribly sorry mr
by this time de mille is on his feet
it must be about that appalling script of hers
what can i say to her
what can i say
i can tell her youre all tied up in the projection room
i can give her the brush
listen thirty million fans have given her the brush
isnt that enough
i didnt mean to of course you didnt
you didnt know norma desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster
i hear she was a terror to work with
she got to be
a dozen press agents working overtime can do terrible things to the human spirit
to the set hold everything
he leaves accompanied by his entourage
normas limousine drives up
max dismounts and opens the door
taking gilliss hand dont you want to come along darling
i dont think so
its your script
its your show
thank you darling
she presses his hand against her cheek descends from the car and walks toward the first assistant is holding it open
in the door way stands mr
seeing norma he stretches out his arms
hello young fellow
she has reached him
last time i saw you was someplace very gay
i remember waving to you
i was dancing on a table
lots of people were
lindbergh had just landed in paris
come on in
he leads her into during the ensuing dialogue mr
demille walks norma towards the set
norma i want to apologize for not calling you
im very angry
im pretty busy as you can see
thats no excuse
you read the script didnt you
yes i did
then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants
dont play innocent
somebody named gordon cole
and if you hadnt been pretty darned interested in that script he wouldnt have tried to get me on the phone ten times
look norma im in the middle of a rehearsal
indicating his own chair make yourself comfortable
he walks onto the set accompanied by his assistants
sotto voce to his first assistant get me gordon cole on the phone
meanwhile norma starts to sit sees the name miss lamarr on the chair and with a look of distaste changes and sits on the one marked c
from somewhere comes hey miss desmond
she looks around her
norma looks up at the scaffolding
on the scaffold stands one of the electricians next to his light
its met its hog eyel norma waves at him
hog eye points his light at her
lets get a look at you
the beam of the lamp moves toward norma
it hits her
she sits bathed in light
a couple of old costume extras recognize her
say its norma
they rush over and start wringing her hand
into the shot comes a middle aged hairdresser
hello miss desmond
some elderly electricians and stagehands move in
the first assistant brings the portable phone to demille
demille lifts the receiver
gordon cole speaking
cole this is c
have you been calling norma desmond
whats it about
its that car of hers an old isotta fraschini
her chauffeur drove it on the lot the other day
it looks just right for the crosby picture
we want to rent it for a couple of weeks
well thank you
he hangs up walks back towards norma
camera norma stills sits in the shaft of light surrounded by about a dozen people who have come up to pay court
demille gestures up to hog eye and the light shifts away
the people about norma disperse slowly with various ad libs
he sits down next to her i got hold of gordon cole
norma hasnt heard a word
did you see them
did you see how they came
you know crazy things happen in this business
i hope you havent lost your sense of humor
suddenly he realizes that she is crying
she takes the handkerchief from his pocket and puts it over her eyes
whats the matter norma
i just didnt realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio
i had no idea how id missed it
weve missed you too dear
well be working again wont we chief
well make our greatest picture
thats what i want to talk to you about
its a good script isnt it
its got a lot of good things
of course it would be an expensive picture
i dont care about the money
i just want to work again
you dont know what it means to know that you want me
nothing would thrill me more if it were possible
but remember darling i dont work before ten in the morning and never after in the afternoon
the first assistant comes up
were ready with the shot mr
youll pardon me norma
why dont you just sit and watch
he steps onto the set o
here we go
the scene starts
max stands talking to gillis who is seated in the car
pointing to the row of offices in the building opposite you see those offices there mr
they used to be her dressing room the whole row
that didnt leave much for wallace reid
he had a great big bungalow on wheels
i had the upstairs
see where it says readers department
i remember my walls were covered with black patent leather
the words readers department have registered on gillis mind
he gets out of the car
ill be with you in a minute
he crosses the street towards the green staircase leading to the second floor
meanwhile two prop men walking down the street come into the shot
hey thats the comic car cole was talking about
to max do you mind if we look inside
behind the desk sits betty typing the synopsis of a novel a half eaten apple marking her place
the door behind her opens and gillis enters
just so you dont think im a complete swine if theres anything in dark windows you can use take it
its all yours
well for heavens sake
she moves the book and the apple aside and points at the free space on the desk
have a chair
gillis sits on the desk
i mean it
its no good to me anyway
why should you do that
if you get a hundred thousand for it you buy me a box of chocolate creams
if you get an oscar i get the left foot
you know id take you up on that in a minute
im just not good enough to do it all by myself
what about all those ideas you had
see if they make sense
to begin with i think you should throw out all that psychological stuff exploring a killers sick mind
psychopaths sell like hotcakes
this story is about teachers their threadbare lives their struggles
here are people doing the most important job in the world and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re sole their shoes
to me it can be as exciting as any chase any gunplay
now i see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school
the first time they meet
from below comes the sound of the isottas horn
look if you dont mind i havent got time to listen to the whole plot
ill make it short
its your baby now
im not good enough to write it alone
well have to do it together
im all tied up
couldnt we work in the evenings
six oclock in the morning
this next month im completely at your disposal
artie is out of town
what has artie to do with it
good for you
youve got yourself the best guy in town
i think so
theyre on location in arizona shooting a western
im free every evening every week end
if you want we could work at your place
its just impossible
nobody can be that busy
there is another honk from down below
look betty it cant be done
youre tough all right
youre on your own
stop being chicken hearted and write that story
honest to goodness i hate you
turning n the open door and dont make it too dreary
how about this for a situation she teaches daytimes
he teaches at night
they dont even know each other but they share the same room
its cheaper that way
as a matter of fact they sleep in the same bed in shifts of oourse
are you kidding
because i think its good
so do i
came on back
let me show you where it fits in
she reaches in a drawer for her notes on dark windows
at the door so long
betty picks up the apple and is about to throw it after him
oh you and heres a title an apple for he ducks out quiokly slamming the door behind him
betty looks after him then angrlly hurls the apple into the wastebasket
max is rush ng up the stairs toward the descending gillis
whats the matter max
i just found out why all those tele phone calls
it is not miss desmond they want
it is the car they want to rent
max has seen something off
with his head he indicates the first assistant has opened the door
demille is showing norma out
goodbye young fellow
well see what we can do
embracing him im not worried
everything will be fine
the old team together
nothing can stop us
she turns and walks out of the shot
de mille stands for a second watching her then turns to his assistant
get gordon cole
tell him to forget about her car
he can find another old car
ill buy him five old cars if necessary
they turn back into stage
gillis seated in the rear
max is helping norma in and putting the robe over her
apprehensively how did it go
it couldnt have gone better
its practically set
of course he has to finish this picture first but mine will be his next
there is an exchange of looks between max and gillis
he must be quite a guy
hea a shrewd old fox
he can smell box office
only im going to outfox him a litt e
this isnt going to be c
its going to be norma desmonds salome a norma desmond production starring norma desmond
yes miss desmond
as he says the words he and gillis exchange a glance in the rear view mirror
absolutely no makeup
a after that an army of hand with a strong small beauty experts invaded flashlight comes into the her house on sunset picture
the beam of the boulevard
she went flashlight travels over the through a merciless face exploring it merci series of treatments lessly
while the light is massages sweat cabinets still on it two pairs of mud baths ice compres creamed hands come into the ses electric devices
shot and start to massage it
she lived on vegetable juices and went to bed dissolve to at nine
she was deter mined to be ready ready for those cameras e a short montage of various that would never turn
beauty treatments applied to norma
it is nine oclock in the evening
she is in night gown and negligee and has put triangular patches on the saddle of her nose and at the outer corner of each eye
she is rubbing lotion on her hands
she gets up and crosses to the door of gillis room and opens it a crack
joe darling are you there
it is dark except for a lamp over the chaise longue
gillis lies on it fully clothed reading a book
through the slit in the door there is a suggestion of norma
dont turn around
keep your eyes on the book
norma pushes the door open and comes in
i just came to say good night
i dont want you to see me im not very attractive
ive lost half a pound since tuesday
i was a little worried about the line of my throat
this woman has done wonders with it
youd better get to bed yourself
i think ill read a little
you went out last night didnt you joe
why do you say that
i just happen to know it
i had a nightmare and i screamed for you
you werent here
where were you
i went for a walk
no you didnt
you took the car
all right i drove to the beach
norma you dont want me to feel im locked up in this house
of course not joe
its just that i dont want to be left alone
not now while im under this terrible strain
my nerves are being torn apart
all i ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind
i havent done anything norma
of course you havent
i wouldnt let you
she bends and kisses the top of his head
good night my darling
she goes into her room shutting the door behind her
gillis puts his book down and looks at her door
the light can be seen through the gouged out keyhole
it goes out
gillis with his coat on by yes i was playing hooky now comes cautiously to the upper railing and looks every evening along in down into the lighted hall below
it made me think i max is just extinguishing of when i was twelve and the lights
max exits in the direction of the liv used to sneak out on the ing room
folks to see a gangster after a moment gillis starts silently down the stairs
this time it wasnt to see a picture it was to try and write lighted only by the last flicker of a fire on the one
that story of mine hearth
max is putting a fire screen in front of betty schaerer had dug the fire
he hears some steps and the creak or the up kept going through main door being opened
he looks out and sees my head like a dozen locomotives
e a the main door gillis in the moonlit porch is closing the main door behind him
max looks after gillis his face enigmatic as ever
gillis comes into the shot gets into the isotta drives it out or the garage and down the driveway to sunset as quietly as possible
start on a long shot
the gillis voice boom moves forward to the only so wed started two lights
they are the door working on it the and window of betty schaefers two of us
betty sits at the when the studio was desk typing
gillis his deserted up in her coat off his shirt sleeves little cubby hole rolled up j
s pacing the floor of an office
discussing the construction of a sentence
the discussion at a stalemate betty suggests some coffee
from the electric plate on the shelf beside her betty takes a glass coffee machine
gillis seats himself in her chair and starts typing
betty opens the door and comes out on the balcony to fill the coffee machine from the water cooler stand ing beside the door
i got the funniest letter from artie
its rained every day since they got to arizona
they re wrote the whole picture for rain and shot half of it
now the sun is out
nobody knows when theyll get back
she moves back into the room
whats good about it
i miss him something fierce
i mean this is good dialogue along in here
especially with lots of music underneath drowning it out
dont you sometimes hate yourself
no in all serious ness its really good
its fun writing again
im happy here honest i am
he resumes typing
betty puts the water on
she picks up a pack of cigarettes on the desk finds its empty and throws it away sees gillis open gold cigarette case and lighter on the table by the
betty reaches for a cigarette
the inscription en graved inside the case catches her eye
it reads norma whos norma
i dont usually read private cigarette cases
its from a friend of mine
a middle aged lady very foolish and very generous
this is solid gold
i gave her some advice on an idiotic script
its that old familiar story you help a timid little soul across a crowded street
she turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money
thats the trouble with you readers
you know all the plots
now suppose you proof read page ten while the water boils
paramount studio night sometimes when we got stuck wed make a gillis and betty are walking litte tour of the down it
from a stage where drowsing lot not talk they are erecting a new set ing much just wandering comes a great shaft of light
down alleys between the they stop at an apple vending sound stages or through machine in the foreground buy the sets they were get themselves a couple of apples ting
ready for the next and walk on
as a matter of fact it was dissolve to on one of those walks when she first told me about her nose
betty and gillis are walking down it the camera look at this street
all card board all hollow all phoney
all done with mirrors
i like it better than any street in the world
maybe because i used to play here when i was a kid
what were you a child actress
i was born just two blocks from this studio
right on lemon grove avenue
father was head elec trician here till he died
mother still works in wardrobe
second generation huh
grandma did stunt work for pearl white
i come from a picture family
naturally they took it for granted i was to become a great star
so i had ten years of dramatic lessons diction dancing
then the studio made a test
well they didnt like my nose it slanted this way a little
i went to a doctor and had it fixed
they made more tests and they were crazy about my nose only they didnt like my acting
examining her nose by the flame of his lighter nice job
it cost three hundred dollars
saddest thing i ever heard
not at all
it taught me a little sense
i got me a job in the mail room worked up to the stenographic
now im a reader
come clean betty
at night you weep for those lost closeups those gala openings
whats wrong with being on the other side of the cameras
its really more fun
three cheers for betty schaefer
i will now kiss that nose of yours
if you please
gillis kisses her nose
as he stands there his face close to hers may i say you smell real special
it must be my new shampoo
thats no shampoo
itsmore like a pile of freehly laundred hand kerchiefs like a brand new auto mobile
how old are you anyway
thats it theres nothing like being twenty two
now may i suggest that if were ever to finish this story you keep at least two feet away from me
now back to the typewriter
they start walking in the direction of the office
gillis gets out
from the seat next him he takes a batch of script folds it and puts it in his pocket
he suddenly becomes aware that he is watched turns
max stands in the moonlight evidently waiting for him
what is it max
want to wash the car or are you doing a little spying in your off hours
you must be very careful as you cross the patio
madame may be watching
how about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark
will that do it
im not inquiring where mr
gillis goes every night
why dont you
im writing a script and im dying to finish it no matter what
its just that im very worried about madame
sure you are
and were not help ing her any feeding her lies and more lies
getting herself ready for a pioture
what happens when she finds out
she never will
that is my job
it has been for a long time
you must understand i discovered her when she was eighteen
i made her a star
i cannot let her be destroyed
you made her a star
i directed all her early pictures
there were three young directors who showed promise in those days d
demille and max von mayerling
and shes turned you into a servant
it was i who asked to come back humiliating as it may seem
i could have gone on witn my career only i found everything unendur able arter she divorced me
you see i was her rirst husband
one lamp lit
norma in a white negligee with the patches on her face is pacing up and down a small tormented pitiable woman
finally she opens the door to gillis lies in bed asleep norma in the doorway
youre here joe
when did you come home
where were you
is it a woman
i know its a woman
who is she
oh joe why cant i ask you
i must know i must
her eyes fall on gillis coat which hangs over a chair
in a pocket is part of the script
norma takes it out looks at it
she cant see it in the moonlight
she hurries with it into carrying the script norma goes to the lamp and looks at it
on the first page she sees something which confirms all her suspicionso it reads by joseph c
gilliss and betty schaefer betty is typing
gillis sits on the couch proof reading a scene
betty stops typing and gillis becomes aware of her eyes fixed on him
hey whats the matter
betty wake up
he whistles and catches her attention why are you staring at me like that
whats wrong with you tonight
what is it betty
something came up
i dont want to talk about it
i just dont
what is it youve heard
come on lets have it
betty gets up
is it about me
betty doesnt answer walks out on she leans against a post crying
gillis comes out after her
betty theres no use running out on it
lets face it what ever it is
i got a telegram from artie
he wants me to come on to arizona
he says it only oosts two dollars to get married there
it would kind of save us a honeymoon
why dont you
we can finish the script by thursday
betty stands crying silently
youre getting married
thats what youve always wanted
i dont want it now
dont you love artie
of course i love him
i always will
im just not in love with him any more
there is a moments pause before he takes her in his arms
the camera moves away
desmond home night it wasn t until i got back to that peculiar gillis enters closes prison of mine that i the door as quietly as started facing the facts
he can and goes up there it was betty the stairs
schaefers future right in the palm of my hand
e gillis room betty schaefer engaged to artie green as nice he enters and turns on the a guy as ever lived
he sinks down on and she was in love with the chaise longue thinking
she was a fool his eyes wander to the not to sense that there door of normas room
was something phony in through the gouged out key my set up
and i was a hole he sees the light
heel not to have told her
but you just cant say those things to somebody youre crazy about
maybe id never have to
maybe i could get away with it get away from norma
maybe i could wipe the whole nasty mess right out of my life
from normas room comes the sound of a telephone being dialled
gillis enters the shot and stands listening
is this gladstone
norma lies in bed dialing a number
she has the beauty patches at the corners of her eyes and over her nose
can i speak to miss betty schaefer
she must be home by now
connie a girl of bettys age with whom she shares the flat is on the phone
betty in a dressing gown comes from the bathroom toothbrush in hand

miss schaefer im trying to do you a favor
im trying to spare you a great deal of misery
of course you may be too young to even suspect there are men of his sort
norma contd i dont know what hes told you but he does not live with relatives nor with friends in the usual sense of the word
ask him again
during the latter part of her call the doors from gillis room have been pushed open and gillis has walked towards her
suddenly norma senses his pre sence and turns around
the telephone freezes in her hand
she tries to hang it up
very calmly gillis takes the receiver from her hand
into phone thats right betty ask me again
this is joe
joe where are you
whats this all about
norma beside him
or maybe it would be a better idea if you came over and saw it for yourself
the address is he hangs up
norma looks up at him as he crosses to the other end of the room and stands staring at her
the silence becomes unbearable
dont hate me joe
i did it because i need you
i need you as i never needed you
look at me
look at my hands look at my face look under my eyes
how can i go back to work if im wasting away under this torment
you dont know what ive been through these last weeks

and i wish youd keep still so i can hear the doorbell when she rings it

betty turns the car into the driveway of normas place stops at the entrance steps
betty gets out
betty let me come along with you

she shuts the door of the car and goes up the steps
norma lies on the bed
gillis sits in a far corner of the room motionless
in a whimpering monotone i love you joe
i love you joe
i love you joe
i love you joe
there is the sound of footsteps below and the ringing of a doorbell
what are you going to do joe
without a word he leaves the room
norma raises herself on the bed reaching for a black negligee lying at the foot of it
as she does so she dis lodges her pillow a little revealing a revolver hidden beneath it
max crosses the hall putting on his alpaca jacket
he turns on the lights
outside stands betty
from the staircase comes its all right max

he stands back as gillis opens the door
on the threshold i dont know why im so scared joe
is it something awful

as he leads her into the living room gillis puts his arm around her shoulders

i havent heard any of this

betty turns from him to hide the fact that she is crying
all right baby
this way out
he leads her in the direction of the door
sitting crouched behind the balustrade is norma peering down into betty and gillis have reached the entrance door
gillis opens it
good luck to you betty
you can finish that story on the way to arizona
when you and artie get back if the two of you ever feel like a swim heres the pool
he switches on the light
the lights go on in the pool which shines brilliant ly in the dark garden
she doesnt even look
her eyes filled with tears she runs down the entrance porch toward her car
gillis looks after her closes the door
from the upper landing comes the sound of soft sobbing
he looks up
gillis ascends the stairs
thank you joe thank you joe
she tries to take his hand to kiss it as he passes
he doesnt stop
norma catches his coat
gillis moves right on into his room
norma lies on the floor looking after him
she crawls toward a con sole pulls herself up by it starts towards gillis door passes a mirror realizes how she looks moves back to the mirror and takes the
patches off her face and does a hasty job of removing the cream with her handkerchief readjusts her expression to a poor travesty of a smile and goes to the door of gillis room
may i come in
ive stopped cry ing
im all right again
joe tell me youre not cross tell me everything is just as it was joe
she opens the door
in the foreground open on the bed is a half packed suitcase gillis just putting some of his old shirts in
norma stands staring speechless for a second
gillis moves out of the shot towards the closets
what are you doing joe
what are you doing
youre not leaving me
yes i am norma
no youre not
max is a good idea
he can help with my luggage
he gestures in the direction of the closet thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe
and thanks for the use of all the trinkets
he takes the cigarette case and throws it on the chaise longue
then he throws the lighter the wrist watch the platinum key chain and the tie clip
indicating the bureau the rest of the jewelry is in the top drawer
its yours joe
i gave it to you
and id take it in a second norma only its a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in dayton ohio
these are nothing
you can have anything you want if youll only stay
what is it you want money
norma youd be throwing it away
i dont qualify for the job not any more
you cant do this
i cant face life without you and im not afraid to die you know
thats between you and yourself norma
you think i made that up about the gun
she rushes into her room
gillis closes the suitcase calmly notices that he is still wearing some cuff links norma gave him takes them off
norma reappears in the door carrying the revolver
see you didnt believe me
now i suppose you dont think i have the courage
sure if it would make a good scene
you dont care
but hundreds of thousands of people will carel wake up norma
youd be killing yourself to an empty house
the audience left twenty years ago
now face it
during the preceding
max has entered
he stands listening paralyzed
thats a lie
they still want me
no they dont
what about the studio
what about de mille
he was trying to spare your feelings
the studio wanted to rent your car
de mille didnt have the heart to tell you
none of us has had the heart
thats a lie
they want me they want me
i get letters every day

norma grow up
youre a woman of fifty
theres nothing tragic about being fifty not unless you try to be twenty five
im the greatest star of them all
no one leaves a star
that makes one a star
gillis picks up the typewriter and leaves
youre not leaving me
gillis descending with the typewriter
there is the sound of a shot
the glass of the front door is shattered
gillis at the door opens it and walks out without looking back
down the staircase rushes norma
a disordered wild ness in the way she moves
youre not leaving me
she hurries after gillis
dark except for lights from the house and the luminousness of the lit pool
gillis is crossing the patio towards the garage
he is carrying the typewriter
he doesnt accelerate his step although he has heard the shot
behind him norma comes from the lighted house
youre not leaving me
she shoots twice in rapid succession
gillis drops the typewriter
the shots have swung him around
he is now facing norma
she shoots him
this shot hits him in the belly
he doubles up instinctively backs away from her plummets into the lit pool
up the stone steps from the garage rushes max
he sees the situation hurries towards norma who stands exultant in the strange light from the pool
stars are ageless arent they
dawn is breaking
at the edge of the pool stand policemen detectives and police photographers
motorcycle policemen are holding off the mob which is trying to storm the house
a lietuenant from the homicide bureau leaves the crowd around the pool and goes into it is filled with a pandemonium of police officers newspaper people etc
who are kept from the upper floor by two policemen at the head of the stairs
the lieutenant from the homicide bureau goes through the crowd to the telephone at the foot of the stairs picks up the phone and dials
i want to speak to the coroner

standing talking into it is hedda hopper

the camera pans to another part of the bedroom where norma sits at a mirror staring at herself blankly

what would they do to her

the interrogators are still firing questions at norma who sits lifeless staring at herself
