erin brockovich early draft by susannah grant a true story by susannah grant february palms sway
the sun washes everything in yellow
cars motor down either side of the landscaped median
the calls of mockingbirds mingle with the blip blip of car alarms
on the sidewalk a skateboard ca lunks down the sidewalk past the foot traffic of southern californians flip flops doc martens rollerblades nikes
then in the middle of this pedestrian normalcy a pair of impossibly high spike heeled pumps struts out of a shop
so high it hurts to look at them
as the shoes leave frame we tilt up and see theyre leaving a cent store
as the pumps turn and head up the street we see they are connected to a pair of impossibly long shapely legs
eveready legs they just keep going and going
they saunter past two businessmen on a lunch break
the men pause and glance as men tend to when they see a beautiful woman
in fact everyone this woman passes lets their eyes rest on her a microsecond longer than usual
two skateboarders note the stretchy micro mini skimming the tops of her thighs
a mailman spots the big dark sunglasses tucked into a a pre teen girl glimpses the plunging neckline of the it isnt until she rounds the corner at the end
of the block that we see her entire figure and appreciate why everyone is so goggle eyed
eye catching is an understatement
all those folks who say barbies proportions are unrealistic have obviously never met erin brockovich
a side street
no pedestrians just parked cars
a parking ticket flaps under the wiper of an old hyundai
even when she talks dirty theres a heartland goodness to her voice
like kansas corn fields swaying in the breeze
as she grabs the ticket from the windshield her sunglasses accidentally clatter to the ground
when she picks them up a fingernail snags on the pavement
god damn it
she tends to the nail as she opens her car door and gets in
the hyundai starts it up signals
then just as it pulls slowly out into the street a jaguar barrels around the corner accelerating out of the turn and rams into the side of erins car sending
it careening into the median
it smashes into a foot thick lightpost
a boring building on a boring block in the valley surrounded by strip malls
definitely not where the power lawyers work
how you doing today
cottage cheese ceilings motel art
a sign over the reception desk reads masry vititoe attorneys at law
ed masry senior partner slumps by rosalind his chipper receptionist with a cup of coffee in his hand
hes in his mid s compact and even though its only am already rumpled
dont ask that on mondays rosalind
whatever passion he once had for the personal injury law that is his career has long since dissipated
he trundles off toward his office
eds secretary brenda s jaded hates her job but what can you do
is on the phone when ed rounds the corner
she puts the call on hold turns to ed
whos responsible for his pain and suffering this time
his dry cleaners
you want him
what do you think
he grabs a gift wrapped bottle off her desk reads the card
from your drug dealer friend
carlos isnt a friend hes a client
hes a low life
speaking of which thats your nine oclock in there
ed peers into his office
its a mess papers everywhere unopened mail
standing in the middle of the room is erin in a teensy leopard print mini dress
as she jiggles a spike heeled foot everything about her shimmies gloriously
except her head which is held in place by a neck brace
to brenda remind me
not her fault she says
sarcastic and she looks like such an honest girl dont you think
you shouldnt judge brenda
lap dancers are people too
as ed heads into his office brenda picks up the phone
i cant find him tony
well have to call you back
not an office that exudes authority and eds blustery entrance only adds to the sense of chaos
sorry you had to wait
here sit down sit down
he clears a stack of papers off a chair
thanks a lot
as she sits i tell you i never thought just standing would take it out of me but ever since that shithead hit me it feels like my whole bodys
put together wrong
ed gives her a look of pro forma sympathy
jesus you poor thing
he sits well listen you came to the right place
whoever did this to you made one hell of a mistake and you and me were gonna make him pay for it
he takes out a pad and paper gets ready to write
why dont you tell me what happened
erin is on the stand wearing the most conservative thing she owns a red form fitting mini dress telling her story to ed whos questioning her
i was pulling out real slow and out of nowhere his jaguar comes racing around the corner like a bat outta hell
she glances at the defendants table where a doctor sits nobly in surgical scrubs
his wife and two beautiful kids are behind him
a frigging norman rockwell painting
they took some bone from my hip and put it in my neck
i didnt have insurance so im about seventeen thousand in debt right now
couldnt take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids
matthews six katies four and beths just nine months
just wanna be a good mom a nice person a decent citizen
just wanna take good care of my kids
oh so moved yeah
erin is still on the stand
but now the doctors lawyer is questioning her
seventeen thousand in debt
is your ex husband helping out
feigning shock theres more than one
erin looks over at the jury
the personification of conservative family values
getting defensive not like a career cause i had my babies
but i woulda worked for sure if i didnt have this neck thing
erin sees a juror staring judgmentally at her short hem
erin gives it a tug pulling it down a stitch
erin sees a few jurors share dubious glances
the defendants lawyers is on the offensive
erins starting to feel the case slipping away
you mustve been feeling pretty desperate that afternoon
pointed whats your point
ed shakes his head slightly to her dont get mad
broke three kids no job
a doctor in a jaguar mustve looked like a pretty good meal ticket
erin sees jurors nodding almost imperceptibly in agreement
shes on a sinking ship
hey he hit me so you say
he came tearing around the corner out of control an er doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control erupting that asshole smashed in my
the door to the courtroom flies open and erin comes out furious
ed follows her as she heads for the elevator
open and shut
open and fucking shut if you hadnt used profanity oh please it was long over by then
god damn he made me look like some cheap i told you the questions might get a little personal bullshit
you told me id get half a million dollars
you told me id be set
ed notices her ranting is starting to draw attention
okay lets try and settle down here
settle down i got bucks to my name mr
i cant afford to settle down
im sorry erin
well fuck you
sorry doesnt feed my kids
erin turns away from him and heads for the stairway
a shitty little house in a shitty part of northbridge
the hyundai with a bashed in side pulls up to the curb
erin gets out takes the mail from her mailbox then heads over to the equally grim house next door and rings the bell
a hispanic woman in her s opens the door holding a white baby
this is mrs
youre back so soon
how was it
she hands erin the baby
its beth erins month old
erin avoids the question by focusing on her baby
were you a good girl
where are matt and katie
outside with the sprinkler
so its good
the truth is too depressing to share
itll be fine yeah
because i didnt want to tell you before with your worries what
my daughter shes bought a big house with a room for me
im going to move in with her
youre moving away
stunned wow thats soon i know
but its good for me
now i can help my daughter take care of my grandkids
and its good for you too
now you have money you can find a good babysitter huh
not the old lady next door
in erins arms beth starts to cough
erin carries beth up to her house
as she nears her door she steps on a giant water bug
it crunches under her sole
insult added to injury
she heads up to the house dragging her shoe wiping off the bug guts
just as dull inside
salvation army furniture
a lot of beige
erins two older kids matthew and katie are at the table
beth is in a baby seat
erin spoons some mac cheese onto their plates trying to hide her worry
i dont like this part its all crusty
i like the crust
erin switches the plates
put your napkins in your laps and eat up
how come youre not eating
cause there isnt enough food
mammas gonna eat later
from her baby seat on the table beth coughs some more
thick sick sounding coughs
erin looks at her
dont go getting sick on me baby
the shower and sink are both on full filling the room with steam
erin is seated with coughing crying beth on her lap trying to steam the illness out of her
its gonna be okay sweetheart
but her face doesnt look like she believes it
matt and katie are messing around with a gumball machine
erin is holding beth wandering the aisles
she stops at the medicines thinks for a long moment then hating herself glances to make sure no ones looking and picks up a bottle
as a customer steps away from the register erin steps up with the bottle in her hand and smiles at the check out lady
hi remember me
i was in yesterday
bought a whole mess of stuff
round about five
honey its a zoo here at five
im lucky if i even see a face much less remember it
oh shoot yeah i guess thatd be tough
well listen i meant to buy my baby here some medicine and by the time i got home i realized id bought the adult stuff by mistake
and now wouldnt you know i cant find the receipt
i was wondering could i maybe exchange it anyway
erin feeds beth her medicine feeling miserable about it
no matter what your mamma does lying and stealing is real bad
i dont ever wanna hear you doing something like that
on the table beside her sit the classifieds
row after row of want ads circled then x d out in red
a water bug crawls across the edge of the paper
cause theres no excuse for it you hear me
no excuse at all
ed enters with a cup of coffee in his hand
as he heads to his desk he trips on a box of files
coffee sloshes out of his cup onto his shirt
calling out brenda
she pops her head in
he grabs a tissue swabs his shirt then kicks at the box
what the hell is this doing here
its those files you asked for
i didnt mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor
look at me
what do i have this afternoon
nothing you cant show up for with a stain
as ed checks his reflection in the glass wall of his office he notices on the other side erin standing in the middle of the secretaries area in a miniskirt
and leather bustier talking to mario the firms mentally challenged office boy
mario heads away from her
whats she doing here
ed goes to his office door and waves mario over
hey mario whats she doing here
she works here
ed looks back at her what the hell
the support staff mostly middle aged women are all stealing glances at erin
ed comes up to her all friendly
hows it going
up close the wear and tear of worry show on her face
you never called me back
i left messages
wow sorry about that
beat listen marios a little not so bright
he seems to think that you said theres two things i cant stand mr
being ignored and being lied to
you did both
glances skitter between the secretaries get a load of this
ed lowers his voice
i never lied
i may have miscalculated that happens sometimes but you said things would be fine and theyre not
im sorry about that
but i dont need pity
i need a paycheck
and ive looked but when youve spent the last six years raising babies its real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn
so i figure since youre the one who said i was gonna be okay you should be the one to hire me
ed sees everyone watching him listening
id love to help erin but im sorry i have a full staff right now so he starts to escort her out but she stays put
if you had a full staff youd have time to return your damn phone calls
shes backing him into a corner here
he shifts gears
if you really want to apply for a job here you can do it the way everyone else does
send in a resume make an im not everyone else mr
im someone you made promises to that you didnt deliver on
i trusted you
with my kids well being
now im smart and im hard working and ill do anything
but if you think im leaving here without a job you got another thing coming
ed glances around the room
not a whole lot of options here
he looks back at erin
a tight office lined with file cabinets and shelves
anna the humorless file clerk is showing erin around
what we do in here is keep track of all the case files
that way at any time we can find out a cases status where it is in the office stuff like that
we file em all here alphabetically oh hell
beat im dyslexic
thats a joke right
erin shakes her head no
great thinks anna
as anna shows erin around the office they pass jane the bitter office manager and brenda at the coffee area
just last week he told my sister we werent hiring
whats your sister look like
ed is packing up his office
erin sticks her head in
he turns sees her
i was wondering could you tell me who id talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck
just for the weekend
janes the office manager
she handles payroll and petty cash
but she leaves early on fridays
ed looks at her a moment sees that its far from okay
oh for christs sake
he takes out his wallet looks in
all i have is hundreds
i dont wanna take your money mr
bullshit you dont
he slaps a hundred in her hand and leaves
when hes gone she looks at the bill her life raft and gives it a great big kiss
erin is at the door taking beth from the babysitter a shabby unkempt looking woman in her s
katie and matt pull on their backpacks and troop out of the sitters house
erin is leaving the store carrying beth in one arm and a bag of groceries in the other
katie and matt are each carrying a bag of groceries as well
they are all singing and moving with the jaunty step of the newly carefree
katie spots a flower display outside the store
mommy can i get a flower
sweetheart you can get a whole big bunch
a small room with salvation army furniture
a bunch of daisies is propped in a ragu jar on katies bedside table
matt and katie are asleep in bed
erin looks down at them smiles then kisses them good night
erin comes out of the bedroom and softly closes the door
but just as the handle clicks into place the house is filled with the deafening roar of a motorcycle revving and revving
it sounds as if its gonna drive through the wall
erin steps out onto her front stoop and looks over at what used to be mrs
a few motorcycles are parked on the lawn a few bikers are drinking beer on the stoop and one asshole is on his bike revving his engine
but of course he cant hear her
she walks over to him stands right in his line of vision
he sees her and kills the engine
everything about george halaby is tough his denim his leather his bike his long hair
everything but his eyes which twinkle like santas
well hello to you darlin
what the hell do you think youre doing making all that goddamn noise
just introducing myself to the neighbors
well im the neighbors
there now were introduced so you can shut the fuck up
the guys on the porch chuckle
erin turns and starts back to her house
george hops off his bike and follows her
ooh now see if ida known there was a beautiful woman next door ida done this different
lets start over
my names george
just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet and well get along fine
now dont be like that
tell you what
how about if i take you out on a date to apologize for my rudeness
erin shakes her head in disbelief and keeps walking
gimme your number ill call you up proper and ask you out and everything
she stops at her porch turns to him
you want my number
which number do you want george
you got more than one
i got numbers coming out of my ears
like for instance ten
thats one of my numbers
its how many months old my little girl is
you got a little girl
and heres another five
thats how old my other daughter is
seven is my sons age
two is how many times i been married and divorced
you getting all this
is the number of dollars in my bank account
is my phone number
and with all the other numbers i gave you im guessing zero is the number of times youre gonna call it
she turns and heads inside
he calls out after her how the hell do you know your bank balance right off the top of your head like that
see that impresses me
erin walks in wearing her usual garb
she passes the coffee area where jane brenda and anna are milling
brenda sees her gives anna a nudge
they both check out her short hem
anna nudges jane who looks as well
erin glances over just in time to see all three of them staring at her judgementally
she stops in her tracks and stares back
yall got something you wanna discuss
the women go back to stirring their coffees
erin walks on
ed is walking into his office with a coffee cup in his hand when he trips over the same box of files again
calling out brenda
no answer erin is alone filing as she talks on the phone
how longs she been crying like that
well shes got that tooth coming in ed appears in the door carrying the box of files
give her a cold washcloth to suck on sees ed i gotta go theres a clean one in that bag ill check back in a bit
hangs up sorry
my kid wheres anna
out to lunch with the girls
beat well look i got this file i need valued
real estate thing
a lady has some property next to a pg e plant that pg e wants to buy
i need to know what to ask for it
he plunks the box of files on her desk
she stares at it with no idea of how to go about that
he sees her staring at the box
you do know how to do that dont you
i got it
ed heads out but pauses before leaving
youre a girl
how come youre not at lunch with the girls
youre a girl
i guess im not the right kind
erin is at her desk staring bewildered at the files from the box ed gave her which are now spread across her desktop
she sees anna packing up her things to leave
with this real estate valuing stuff could you remind me cause im a little confused about how exactly we do that
exasperated erin youve been here three weeks
if you dont know how to do your job by now i am not about to do it for you
katie and matt are running up to the house
erin follows toting beth under one arm and the box of documents under the other
she steps on another water bug
as she wipes the bug guts off the bottom of her shoe hey neighbor wanna beer
she spots george on his stoop with a six pack beside him
i bought em for you to make up for that night
maybe youll get your money back
he gets up and follows her to her house
now whyre you giving me such a hard time
im just trying to be a good neighbor
erin turns to him
the kids are waiting at the door
i had a good neighbor george
she was and mexican and she watched my kids for free
something tells me youre not gonna be able to measure up to that
you need help with your kids
i could probably do that
george reaches out and grabs the box from under her arm
im not gonna leave my kids with you
cause i dont even know you
yeah and whose fault is that
hes got a point there
after a beat what you got so many friends in this world you dont have use for one more
george is on the floor with matt and katie playing war
katie points to the harley emblem on his leather jacket
whats that stand for
thats for harley davidson
the best damn motorcycle ever made
erin comes in from the kitchen
and if i catch either of you anywhere near one ill knock you silly
go on to bed now ill come tuck you in in a minute
they get up
and head into bed
george starts cleaning up the cards
erin bends down to help him
im probably ruining them
im never here
i gotta leave em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat
i was serious before you know
if you need someone to keep an eye on them after school or something i dont have a job now so im around in the afternoons
im not a deadbeat
i work when i need to
and what do you do the rest of the time live off your trust fund
i do construction which pays real good
and i make it last by living cheap
with a little laugh i hope thats not supposed to impress me
are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you
its been a while
maybe im just out of practice
then lemme remind you the polite thing is to say thank you thats a real nice offer i dont mind taking you up on it
why in the hell would you want to watch my kids
cause i like kids
i like hanging out with them
she starts cleaning up the cards
i like how they keep it all simple you know
they dont get all complicated about life like grown ups do
a bicycle and an ice cream cone boom done theyre happy
erin thinks about the offer
youre around every afternoon
usually working on my bike
shes tempted no big deal
if it doesnt work out you can send em back to the chicken fat lady
erin looks him over
this isnt gonna get you laid you know
with a laugh yeah well just see about that wont we
the wee hours
erins in a t shirt sitting on her mattress on the floor
the paperwork from the box is now spread all over the floor around her
shes reading a letter
its from pg e to donna and peter irving
we see the phrases purchase your house
fair market value
its a list of comparable house sales in the area
owner cost owner cost
every house is in the range
from another room she hears the sound of beth crying
still reading the file erin gets up and goes into still reading erin gets beth out of her crib
erin lies down on the mattress and rests beth on her chest
she sets down the file she was reading and picks up another
it contains a letter from a dr
the first paragraph contains the phrase
medical examination of donna and peter irving
toward the end of the letter there are two columns
one is headed in range
the other out of range
under that head appear the following lymphocytes t lymphocytes natural killer cells t helpers t suppresser cells
erin stares at it confused
erin is talking to jane whos pouring herself coffee
it was in this real estate file im valuing
and see i know theyre the medical records from the people selling the house but it talks about things like lymphocytes and t suppressers
erin sees ed pass behind jane
she lowers her voice so he wont see her asking for help
i mean its not a problem or anything but im just a little unclear on what those things are
i thought maybe youd know
what do i look like erin
and jane walks away with her coffee
through the windows we see erin at the desk talking to a librarian
she has the file in her hands
over this masry vititoe can i help you
hi rosalind this is erin
from the file room
i was wondering if you could tell mr
masry that im following up on that real estate thing out of the office
the librarian gives her directions to somewhere else
smaller but still establishment
erins hyundai pulls into the parking lot
erin is at the reference desk eating a candy bar while she talks to the librarian
he checks something on the computer
a couple of white coated medical students pass her double taking
they dont see many like her around here
a long academic hallway lit by fluorescents
erin gets off an elevator and heads down the hall
she finds a door with a nameplate that reads jim paulsen epidemiology and knocks
the door opens and dr
jim paulsen appears
hes a classic scientist unruly hair thick glasses
nothing like erin has ever shown up at his door
he reels at the sight of her
hi im erin brockovich
i was just over in the library there asking a mess of questions about i guess they call it epidemiology
and the fella there told me to find you cause you know all about it
suspicious is this a joke
did baxter put you up to this
he did didnt he
baxter baxter another scientist leans out of a door down the hall
baxter and erin look at each other
no recognition of course
paulsen is immediately embarrassed
no one put me up to anything
i was just hoping i could ask you a couple questions
mortified of course
oh gosh of course orderly chaos
paulsen still recovering has erins file in his hands
erin is sitting across from him
well look there isnt a ton of information here but from what there is id say that these two people here what are their names
shanna and ashley
right i guess those are the kids theyve both got some immune system problem
cant say what from whether its viral or genetic or what but somethings wrong
and these guys donna and peter their parents im pretty sure
well from what this stuff says id say they both have some form of cancer
thats more serious than erin was expecting
close on the file on the kitchen counter
the irvings phone number is written on the front
a phone is ringing
easy easy easy widen to see erin phone to her ear grabbing a carton of juice from matt and katie who are fighting over it at the table
just as she takes it from them the phone picks up
youve reached the irvings
leave a message and well get back to you just as soon as we can
erin thinks a bit then hangs up and looks at the file
scrawled on the cover is the irvings address in hinkley california
the beat up old hyundai heads east out of l
disco music blares from its speakers
this is a dry desolate part of california
no downtown no community
just tract after tract of arid farmland with small bland unprotected ranch home cropping up out of the landscape like occasional tombstones
a beat up old sign on the road reads hinkley ca
pop but the corner where the number would be has broken off
as a gust of wind lifts dust from the fields erin turns onto community boulevard the main road that cuts through hinkley
erin looks around
the house shes passing has been razed
a heap of lumber and wires in the middle of the property
as she checks the piece of paper with donnas address she drives by the pg e compressor station a massive gray structure of pipes chimneys and ladders set way back
from the road
erin passes it without noticing it
she stops at an intersection
the house on the corner has been boarded up with plywood
erin notices it depressing then turns the corner onto donnas street
a generic ranch home standing all alone in the middle of nothing
theres a pool out back and a chain link fence hugging the property
dull but clean
a few bottles of spring water wait by the door
the hyundai pulls into the driveway and stops
erin gets out
as she heads up to the door her spike heels sink into the dirt
she rings the bell
it has a melody chime
donna irving opens the door
shes petite with a scrappy high strung manner
shes wearing tight jeans and her dark curls are piled on top of her head
im erin brockovich from masry vititoe
a little surprised youre a lawyer
i hate lawyers
i just work for them
you got a minute
the house is furnished with little money but lots of care
erins on a plaid couch in a sea of needlepoint pillows
out back two girls ages and are playing in a pool
this is a real nice place you got here
well it oughta be with all the work i put into it
she comes out from the kitchen with a tray of iced tea
i added air conditioning put in the pool made all those pillows by hand
i should learn to do stuff like that
they make the place feel real homey
donna corrects the positioning on a couple of pillows
i think so too
thats why im being such a stickler on this house price thing
i dont mean to be a pain in pg es backside especially after all theyve done for hinkley but i look around here and i think if they want this
place theyre gonna have to pay for it
and i dont just mean pay for the house id like them to pay me for the trouble of starting over
cause first you gotta move then theres decorating and if the windows arent the same size you know youre making all new curtains
honest to god i dont know if i have the energy
you know ive been sick
me and peter both have
yeah im real glad you brought that up
i was going through your file here and i ran into these medical records
they kinda surprised me this would be the perfect opportunity for many to get self pitying
but not donna
lifes handed her a shitload of lemons and darned if she hasnt made a shitload of lemonade
theyre more than a bit unusual
see two years ago pete got hodgkins disease
thats a kind of cancer yeah im real sorry to hear that
its in remission now thank the lord but you never know
and then while thats going on i end up having to have a hysterectomy
plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts
all benign so far but still no matter how positive you stay an operation can still take it out of you
so the whole idea of selling the house dont get me wrong id be glad to move to some better place but if they arent gonna pay us properly i
just dont see the point
yeah i can see that
beat i guess the only thing that confused me is not that your medical problems arent important but how come the files about them are in with all the real
donna tops off their iced teas
are you kidding
with how our lives are if i start subdividing files ill be sunk
i just kept all pg e correspondence in one place
right but im sorry i dont see why you were corresponding with pg e about it in the first place
well they paid for the doctors visit
paid for a check up for the whole family
and not like with insurance where you pay then wait a year to be reimbursed either
they just took care of it
just like that
we never even saw a bill
why would they do that
cause of the chromium
well thats what kicked this whole thing off
close on a box with chrom info scrawled on it
pg e came around a few years ago told us they put chromium in our well by mistake
and since we shouldnt have to drink it if we dont want to they gave us free spring water and offered to buy our house
widen to see donna pulling the box down into the room
its a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there
well hell maybe thats why you all have been so sick i thought the same thing right off the bat
thats why we went to see the doctor
but hunh uh
turns out ones got nothing to do with the other
she rifles through the box
this is the info they gave us
youll see if you look through it chromiums good for you
when i saw what they charged for it at the health food stores i about fainted
she hands erin a printed fact sheet
erin scans it
seems like an awful big coincidence your water being messed with and you being so sick
not around here
this is a rough part of the world
hard times not a lot of money not a lot of luck
beat its a challenge staying healthy in a town like this
heck even our dogs up and die
erins driving away from donnas house
a street lamp throws light on the box of chromium documents in the passenger seat
she gets to an intersection and looks across the street at the massive compressor station
six stories high lit up like a christmas tree with all sizes of pipes criss crossing the outside and giant cooling towers sticking up out of it
far more massive than anything else in town it looms over the horizon like the capitol in d
peters in rome
erin takes a long look at the compressor station then turns onto community boulevard and drives away
erin is holding beth making her a bottle when she hears noises coming from outside
she follows them
erin opens the door to find george attaching bars to her windows
whatre you doing
better safe than sorry
she shakes her head amused by his persistence
you want some coffee george
george follows erin in
im gonna put a dead bolt on your front door too
this isnt exactly the safest neighborhood in the world you know
thanks for reminding me
i guess we get what we pay for huh
erin pours him some coffee hands it to him
you think it could make you sick living in a place like this
what do you mean
george settles in helps himself to sugar
i was talking to this lady she and her husband both got cancer and she thinks its cause they live in a bad neighborhood
you think thats possible
that living in a bad neighborhood could give you cancer
george laughs a little at the thought
man i hope not
you got enough damn problems
but erins still mulling it over
erin clips down the block in short shorts and high heeled boots
up ahead a few of down on their luck men are out on a stoop drinking their breakfast
erin approaches them
hi yall how you doing today
hangin in baby
how about yourself
im okay im just fine
i was wondering could i maybe ask you a couple questions
she settles down on the stoop with them for a chat
paulsen and erin are sitting talking
hes thrilled to have her back in his office
and when i realized our areas just as bad as hinkley i thought maybe my neighbors are all sick too
so i went and asked
surprised you did
erin digs a pad of paper out of her bag
spent the last few days knocking on doors
and you know what
reads from the pad i mean they got problems but none of this cancer stuff
and their pets are fine
so i dont know i just cant shake the feeling that it wasnt no multivitamin they put in the water
well if youre talking about contamination youre getting out of my area of expertise
let me give you the name of a toxicologist friend of mine over at usc
paulsen reaches for a notepad scrawls on it
paulsen is seeing erin out of his office
i gotta say erin first time i saw you i did not peg you as the kind to go off and conduct her own epidemiological study
dont go telling anyone
itll ruin my reputation
erin towers over david frankel as she walks across campus with him
hes the grittier variety of scientist patagonia birkenstocks bushy beard
hes as dry as dust and as much as dr
paulsen responded to erin frankel barely notices her
what kind of chromium is it
theres more than one kind
theres straight up chromium does all kinds of good things for the body
theres chrom which is fairly benign and then theres chrom hexavalent chromium which depending on the amounts can be very harmful
harmful like how
what would you get
with repeated exposure to toxic levels god anything really respiratory disease liver failure heart failure reproductive failure chronic headaches bone or organ deterioration plus of course any type of cancer
he rattles it off coolly
so that stuff it kills people
highly toxic highly carcinogenic
bad bad stuff
well how do i find out what kind of chromium is up in hinkley
have you been to the water board
every county has one
they keep records of anything water related within their jurisdiction
you should be able to find something there
county water board
all righty thanks
beat oh i wouldnt advertise what youre looking for if i were you
his line continues over erins hyundai pulls up and stops in a cloud of dust
incriminating records have a way of disappearing when people smell trouble
erin hops out checks her reflection in the side view mirror then heads into the building
drab government issue
ross the bored desk clerk is thumbing his way through road track
just as he stops to stare at a motor oil ad in which a buxom blonde is straddling the hood of a car the huge door opens and erin enters
god damn thats a heavy door
ross looks up
its like the girl from the ad walked right off the page
he jumps up to help her with the door
oh hey lemme give you a hand there
thank you very much
arent you a gentleman
real pleased to meet you
he cant believe his luck
what can i do for you erin
well believe it or not i am on the prowl for some water records
with a laugh you come to the right place
laughing along i guess i did
you just tell me what you want to look at and ill be glad to dig em out for you
i wish i knew
its for my boss
hes fighting his water bill and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places
the easiest thing would probably be if i just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself
would that be okay
come on back
just gonna need you to sign in here he hands her a pen
he reads over her shoulder as she signs her name erin pattee brockovich
that your middle name
disappointed youre married
she smiles and winks at him then goes around the counter with him and looks at the stacks and stacks of files
here goes nothing
she heads down an aisle reading the spines of the files
theyre all town names barstow victorville oro grande helendale in no particular order
finally erin spots one that says hinkley
she pulls it down
are pages and pages of xeroxed memoranda letters charts graphs handwritten notes
all shoved in willy nilly
george is watching a football game on tv
hes just put tv dinners on the floor in front of the matt and katie
our mom gives us sandwiches on fridays
thats a sandwich
no its not
sure it is
here ill show you
he picks up matts chicken tears it in two
most people think a sandwichs gotta have bread on the outside
chicken is a perfectly good outside for a sandwich
then places the broccoli neatly between the halves
katie and matthew look at it then up at george and smile
this guy just might be all right after all
its gotten dark
erins hyundais still there
erin is on the floor her legs stretched out in front of her
she has a bunch of files open and spread across the floor
the one in her hand has caught her attention
its a memo titled clean up and abatement order from the water board to pg e
erin is concentrating hard on it reading laboriously to herself
on december the discharger notified the regional board and the san bernardino county environmental health services of the discovery of
ppm of hexavalent chromium in an on site ground water monitoring well
close on a xerox of the abatement order
widen to see it is on top of a stack of papers that erin is carrying as she enters the office
she has an efficient air about her a sense of purpose
erin swoops in ready to work only to find her desk cleared off
she turns to anna whos already hard at work
wheres my stuff
anna looks up
whereve you been
what the fuck did you do with my stuff
dont use language with me but erins out the door before anna can finish her sentence
jane is at her desk
erin barrels in
someone stole my stuff
nice to see you erin
weve missed you
i had photos of my kids plus a mug jane reaches under her desk for a box looks through it
toothbrush toothpaste and a pair of hose
whats going on
there may be jobs where you can disappear for days at a time but this isnt one of them
here if you dont do the work you dont get to stay
she hands her the box
erin doesnt take it
ive been working
shit thats all ive been doing
eds at his desk dialing the phone when erin barrels in
you said to fire me
he sets down the receiver
erin youve been gone for a week
i left a message
ive been dealing with that real estate thing
i was gonna write up a whole damn report and thats not how we work here
you dont just leave a message and take off
jane follows her in still carrying the box of stuff
what am i supposed to do check in every two seconds
its called accountability
i am not talking to you bitch
excuse me okay enough beat now look erin this incident aside i dont think this is the right place for you
so what im gonna do is make a few calls on your behalf
find you something else okay
she turns to jane takes her box and heads out
come on im trying to help here
youre trying to feel less guilty about firing someone with three kids to feed
fuck if ill help you do that
and she leaves
as erin heads for the door pleased glances fly from secretary to secretary
erin reaches the door but cant open it with the box in her arms
she turns to the room
i dont suppose any one of you cunts could open the fucking door for me
erins hyundai rumbles to a stop in front of the house
erin shoves open the creaky reluctant door lifts her box of stuff off the seat and gets out
as she walks around the car and toward the house she runs into the mailman
he hands her a packet of mail
here ya go miz brockovich
erin looks at the top of the stack
its the electric bill
erin enters puts down the box and stares at the mail
bills bills and more bills
as she throws them on the table she sees george coming out of the kitchen
what are you doing here
fixing a leak under your sink
she heads into the kitchen weary and irritated
i didnt ask you to do that
damn it george i dont ask you to do things like that
erin enters sees all the cleaning stuff from under the sink is spread around the kitchen floor
a tool box lies open
im gonna clean it up
erin gets down on her knees and starts putting things away
relax erin ill do it im not before he can finish a huge water bug runs onto erins hand
ugh jesus she jumps and brushes it off
yeah you had a whole family of those things hanging out back there
she takes off her shoe and smacks at the bug missing it
damn it the bug skitters away from her along the floorboard
erin chases it smacking at it repeatedly missing it every time
dont worry about it ill get it later
but erin keeps after it corralling all her frustrations into killing that one bug
come here you little motherfucker the bug crawls up onto the table zipping behind the salt the pepper the napkin holder
erin keeps after it banging the table harder and harder with each smack of her shoe
hey whoa relax the salt and pepper skid off the table
the napkins fly from their holder
just as erins about to nail the bug it slips into a crack in the wall and disappears
erin hurls her shoe at the crack
it smashes into the wall
as erin stands there staring at the wall her breath starts to come heavily those deep breaths that precede tears
she slowly slides down into a chair defeat overcoming her
almost a whisper god damn it
she looks around at her for shit kitchen and starts to cry
what kind of person lives like this
what kind of person lets her kids run around in a house crawling with bugs the size of housecats
its a simple thing
everybody gets them
all we gotta do is call an exterminator
cant call an exterminator
i cant afford one
god i cant even afford my phone beat i got fired
but you been working so hard doesnt matter
doesnt make one bit of difference
then fragile oh god george howd this happen to me
howd i end up so
so nothing george picks a napkin up off the floor hands it to her
youre not nothing erin
well im sure as hell not what i thought i was gonna be
i was supposed to have one of those great lives with everything all laid out and perfect
i mean hell i was miss wichita for gods sakes
did i tell you that
you live next door to a real live beauty queen
wipes her nose i still got the tiara
i kept it cause i thought it meant something
i thought it meant i was gonna do something great with my life
i thought it proved i was gonna grow up to be someone
you are someone
no im not
look at me
youre someone to me
beat youre someone real special to me
he takes a step toward her and kneels in front of her very close
he takes her shoe from her hand and puts it back on her foot
then he takes her hands in his and kisses them
im no good george
i make people miserable
but he kisses her anyway
and for the first time in so long she feels like something other than a failure
he pulls her into him and she lets herself be pulled
erin and george are in bed naked curled around each other
even your earlobes are beautiful
he kisses one
dont be too nice to me okay
it makes me nervous
ed is at his desk
the phone rings
no answer nothing
ed growls in frustration then gets the phone
yeah ed masry here
she doesnt work here anymore
close on the table where beth is bobbing in her baby chair
on one side of her is a heap of bills with past due and please remit stamped on them
on the other the well thumbed classified section with circles and xs all over it
the doorbell rings
erin swoops in and picks up beth
come on baby
maybe thats ed mcmahon
erin carries beth over to the front door spies through the peephole and sees ed standing there
she opens the door
what are you doing here
i got an interesting call this afternoon
it was from a dr
he wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium is
parts per million
and that at the rate you mentioned
it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about
well that was nice of him
isnt it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give em the ax
look im sorry
you were gone
i just assumed you were off having fun
now why in the hell would you assume that
i dont know
maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun
boy are you ever a shitty judge of people
ed takes a beat copping to the charge
so whats the story on this thing
this cancer stuff
you wanna know you gotta hire me back
i got a lot of bills to pay
he glares at her
realizes he has no choice
erin has let ed in
but pg e told her about the chromium
they told her something but it cant have been too specific cause i talked to her and she sure didnt think her water was bad
so what made you think it was
it doesnt take a genius to look at those medical records and think somethings wrong
what medical records
the ones in the box of files
off eds blank look the box of files
the one from your office
i didnt see any medical records in there
boy you musta really fine tooth combed it then huh
to herself and you fired me jesus
ed thinks for a moment
that document you found the one that says it was the bad chromium you didnt happen to make a copy did you
course i did
lemme see it will you
before getting it for him she looks at him weighs her odds
i want a raise
look erin this is not the way i do business this extortion nonsense
erin doesnt budge
a raise and ten
off his look theres a lot of other places i could work
a ten percent raise and benefits
but thats it
im drawing the line
she goes to her box of stuff from the office and digs out the document for him
he scans it
this is the only thing you found
but that place is a pig sty
i wouldnt be surprised if theres more
erins hyundai zips along the freeway
funky town is blaring from the tinny stereo
over it i hate this music
matthews in the front seat
katie and beth in a car seat are in the back
theres no way a son of mine hates funky town
well i hate it
i hate it too
i hate this trip
oh come on wheres your sense of adventure
were going someplace you never been before
im gonna hate it
she glances at them frowns a little
you know what im realizing for the first time
you kids are a couple of downers
i mean you are the real thing a couple of honest to god depresso types
small smile who in the heck raised you anyway
some kind of moron
katie smiles a little
she likes this side of her mom
a real moron
some kind of half wit no good big haired bimbo i bet
also smiling yeah
thank god we got you away from her huh
by now theyre all smiling
funky town plays on
the hyundai is parked at the entrance to the station by a row of dead trees
erin is standing beside a sign that says private property
no trespassing taking pictures of the massive structure in the distance
matthew katie and beth are drawing in the dirt with sticks
stay out of the road
ill be right back
she wanders up the drive onto pg e property moving around the plant taking pictures of it from every possible angle
as she wanders over a big flat dry field to the side of the plant she glances over her shoulder to check on her kids and notices the trail she
made in the dirt has a greenish hue
she looks at the dirt right her feet
kicks the ground
below the surface the dirt turns from brown to green
erin notes this then looks back at her kids playing in the dirt
worry comes over her face
she heads back to them
the kids are waiting at the car
erin comes out of the store with a bottle of water and uses it to rinse off their hands
the sound of a baby crying
the hyundais parked in front
erin is at the xerox machine copying a file while she tries to calm beth
theres a stack of files on the nearby table
matthew and katie are flopping around on the floor
well go eat in a minute
ross goes over to her
you know what erin
i got nothing but time here
why dont you let me do that for you and you can get your kids some dinner
ross you are an absolute angel
she hands ross the stack of documents
ed comes in in the morning and without pausing hands brenda a copy of the stack of documents with a post it on the top
fax these to this number okay
all of em
all of them
he continues into his office and closes the door
brenda types in the number
the recipients i
comes up on the led pg e claims dept
another copy of those documents now in donnas hands
shes on her couch with erin reading them
outside donnas two daughters are playing in the pool
she reads the last page and looks up at erin bewildered
an on site monitoring well
that means it was right up on the pg e property over there
and you say this stuff this hexavalent chromium its poisonous
well then its gotta be a different than whats in our water cause ours is okay
the guys from pg e told me
they sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine
but the toxicologist i been talking to
he gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure
and everything you all have is on that list
donna resists this idea hard
hunh uh see thats not what the doctor said
he said ones got absolutely nothing to do with the other
right but didnt you say he was paid by donna sits quietly trying to make sense of this
the only sound is the laughing and splashing from the pool out back
then gradually donna realizes what it is shes hearing her kids playing in toxic water
she jumps up
and runs out to the pool
erin follows her
from the door erin watches donna run to the edge of the pool in a frantic response to this news
erin watches compassionately as donna flails to get her kids out of the contaminated water
ed is checking the lie of his tie in his reflection in the window
erin is on his couch high heeled legs stretched out in front of her
jane is delivering paychecks
when brenda gets to her desk jane tips her head toward eds office as if to say check it out
brenda peers in and sees erin
whats she doing here
he hired her back
with a raise
why well lets see
its not cause shes smart and its not cause shes professional
takes a beat
and dumb old me thought working hard and being loyal was the way to get ahead
ed is still checking his reflection
im telling you the minute brenda sent the fax im talking the second she pressed that send button pg e claims department is on the phone to me scheduling a
so you think we got em scared
it sure as hell sounded like they were sitting up and taking notice
brenda pops her head in ignores erin
david baum from pg e is at reception
erin feels the chill brendas sending her way
nice to see you again too brenda
brenda leaves without acknowledging erin
ed and erin come out and see david baum waiting at reception
forget law school this kid looks like hes just out of twelfth grade
not a hair on his chin
his suit and shoes look brand new
not to question your judgment or anything mr
masry but that doesnt exactly look like sitting up and taking notice to me
ed and erin are seated across the table from baum
to say this kid lacks authority is a gross understatement
he doesnt talk he squeaks
in the interest of putting this whole thing to rest pg e is willing to offer the irvings dollars for their home
ed laughs a little in disbelief
in terms of land value out in hinkley mr
masry we feel its a more than fair price
what about in terms of medical expenses
doesnt come close to what this familys gonna have to spend on doctors
i understand theyve had a bad run of luck health wise and they have my sympathies
but thats not pg es fault
youre kidding right
baum doesnt answer look at these readings for christs sake
pg es own technicians documented toxic levels of hexavalent chromium in those test wells on numerous occasions
ed shoves them across the table
baum doesnt look at them
everything the irvings have had is a proven reaction to exposure to hexavalent chromium
he stalls a moment
erin jumps in
breast cysts uterine cancer hodgkins disease immune deficiencies asthma chronic nosebleeds
despite their persuasiveness baum parrots what is obviously the party line a million things could have caused those problems
poor diet bad genes irresponsible lifestyle
our offer is final and more than fair
wait a minute i thought we were negotiating here
is all im authorized to offer
ed looks across at this pissant little kid
to himself jesus christ
he stands to leave i will present your offer to my clients
i doubt theyll accept it
as ed starts out mr
masry before you go off on some crusade you might want to remember who it is youre dealing with here
pg e is a billion dollar corporation
containing his anger thanks
ill keep it in mind
and ed leaves the conference room
erin follows him out
erin follows ed as he stomps back to his office
at least they made an offer
that wasnt an offer
a million wouldve been an offer
when they send the god damn mail clerk down to jerk me off waste my time its a fuck you
i dont get why theyd do that
because they can
you heard that kid they have billion dollars at their disposal
they can afford to waste all the time in the world
and you cant
what you think im made of money
behind them baum steps out of the conference room
hey you know where i can get a cab
my plane leaves burbank in forty five minutes
ed turns and looks at him
he gets a tiny smile
tell you what why dont you go on over to reception tell them i said mario should take you to the airport
baum heads out to the reception area
masry mario gets lost going to the bathroom
theyll be driving around the valley for hours
isnt that a shame
she watches him go into his office impressed
well ill be god damned
end of the day
most everyone has left
erin is at her new work space near eds office
shes poring over a fat file of documents
rosalind wanders by with her coat on
youve been reading for hours
im a slow reader on account of the fact that i look at the word dog and see god
hey just so long as you see him
rosalind turns on erins desk lamp and heads out
outside the big glass office doors rosalind stops to talk to a lost looking couple in their mid s
these are mandy and tom brown
hes a security guard uniform with an envelope under his arm
rosalind points to erin
the browns enter the office and approach her
excuse me are you erin brockovich
who are you
im tom brown
this is my wife mandy
we used to live across the street from the irvings
pg e bought our house last year
close on photos of chickens each with a twisted limp neck
its called wry neck
its when theyre born without any muscles in the neck
widen to see erin looking at them with tom and mandy
how many were born like this
twelve maybe thirteen
when donna told us about you and what you told her about the chromium we figured that might have something to do with this too
it sure could yeah
thanks a lot
she tucks them into a file as if thats it
theres something else too
mandy heres had nine miscarriages
are you kidding
my god i know
its an awful lot
im surprised donna didnt say anything
she doesnt know
no one does
its not something you want to talk about you know
i figured it musta been something i did like when i smoked marijuana maybe
or took birth control pills
but then donna told me you thought this chromium might be to blame for her problems so i figured
matt and katie are in bed with the light off
erin comes in quietly in clothes from work
you guys still awake
close on matt and katie
theyre awake and pissed
come on now
george told me he just shut out the light a few seconds ago
they still dont answer
she comes in and sits on a bed
look i know youre mad
but the way this job is things come up at the last minute real important things and i gotta deal with them
now i dont like me missing dinner any more than you do but were all gonna have to get used to it cause the fact is its gonna happen sometimes
it happens all the time
thats not true we had dinner together just last night
you were reading the whole time
hes got a point there
erin feels like shit
im sorry pumpkins
ill try a whole lot harder to be around okay
the room is dark
erin enters and flops down onto the bed exhausted
george is lying on the bed next to her
if its any consolation love you
dry flat california
eds big old mercedes is toodling down the freeway at an overly safe almost geriatric speed
frank sinatra is playing on the stereo
ed is swaying in time
this is his kind of music
he smiles looks at erin
its sinatras world we just live in it
erin glances at the speedometer
his car phone rings
he picks it up
his voice softens hi babys
yes i did
i did too you just didnt feel it
he starts swerving across the lane markers
thwack thwack thwack
ed doesnt notice
erins getting nervous
you think i could leave without kissing my babys
okay here you go
he kisses into the phone
a car barely misses them
erins eyes widen
not fun at all
he finally hangs up smiling to himself
erin clears her throat
um you mind pulling over
just for a second
the mercedes pulls to a stop on the shoulder
erin gets out walks around to the drivers side
opens the door
first of all dont talk baby talk to your wife in front of me
it really undermines your authority
and second i know youre my boss and all but you are the worst fucking driver ive ever seen
move over or i quit
he moves over
she gets in turns off the sinatra
they pull back out onto the freeway in silence
the mercedes and a truck are parked out front
theres something about this whole thing i dont quite understand mr
donna and pete irving and mandy and roy brown are all seated sipping iced tea
while they talk erin hands them all information packets on chromium
ed is standing in front of them a little stiff
if pg e messed with our water why would they bother saying anything about it to us
why not just keep quiet about it
to establish a statute of limitations
see in a case like this you only have a year from the time you first learn about the problem to file suit
so pg e figures well let the cat out of the bag tell the people the waters not perfect if we can ride out the year with no one suing
well be in the clear forever
but it was more than a year ago that they told us its okay
were not suing
all were doing is using this information to get you a real nice purchase price on your house and get you two to the browns a comparable retroactive bonus added
to your sale price
this way and pg e can still look good to their shareholders cause theyre not involved in an ugly lawsuit all theyre doing is buying a little property
roy looks up from his retainer agreement
it doesnt say here how much this whole things gonna cost us
my fees forty percent of whatever you get awarded
erin watches them look around at each other stunned by the figure
boy do i know how you feel
first time i heard that number i said you got to be kidding me
forty god damn percent
erin im the one whos injured and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward
erin erins enjoying eds discomfort almost too much to stop
but just almost
she shifts gears
then i asked him how much he makes if i didnt get anything
they look at ed
then i dont get anything either
and i realized hes taking a chance too
when they hear this and realize hes in it with them they all reach for their pens and sign
they hand the agreements over to erin who takes them across the room to ed
he stuffs them in his briefcase and closes it up
all right then
lets hit the road
cold as ice
erin stares at him stunned by his brusque manner then leans in to him close
masry if you dont mind my saying you got a lot to learn about being friendly
these people just hired you as their lawyer
the least you could do is make a little pleasant conversation
she gives him a stern look then turns toward the women
donna let me help you clean all this up
she picks up a tray of iced tea and cookies and heads to the kitchen
donna and mandy follow leaving ed alone with pete and roy
he stands there awkwardly
then finally so whats uh
erin and donna are putting away the cleaned glasses
mandy is scanning the chromium pamphlet erin gave her
you know that thing it says in here about rashes
well this old neighbor of mine bob linwood he ran the dairy on community seemed like someone in his family always had a rash somewhere or other
i just figured it was something in the genes
and you know how it is you dont like to ask about things like that
erin listens interested
bob linwood s and gruff is in the barn tossing hay around
are you mr
he sees erin picking her way toward him in her high heels
im erin brockovich
i work at the law firm that represents your former neighbors the browns
they suggested i give you a call
she steps in a cow patty
laughs at herself good naturedly
boy howdy did i ever wear the wrong shoes
close on a sign that reads the desotos hanging on the side of a small paint chipped house
erin is at the door talking to mary desoto whos wearing a big cross at her breast
linwood seemed to think that your husband had been sick as well
desoto has lung cancer
never smoked a day in his life neither
erin is talking to mike and laura ambrosino s
solid family folks
but lauras left brow and cheekbone look swollen and misshapen and shes trying to hide the fact that shes in a lot of pain
desoto said she wasnt sure exactly what it was that you had shes not alone on that one
well they know what it is its called fibrous dysplasia the bones start growing again
gives her headaches like you wouldnt believe
they just dont know what caused it
erin is talking to ted and rita daniels
their daughter annabelle is sitting on the couch wrapped in a blanket
then mike ambrosino remembered seeing you folks at the hospital from time to time too so i thought id just stop by
to annabelle you must be annabelle
whew are you ever a beauty
i mean you must drive those boys crazy
annabelle smiles a little
george rolls over erins side of the bed is empty
he checks the clock then gets up and heads into he peers around and spots her sitting in the little kids chair in matthew and katies room
erin is holding beth watching matt and katie sleep
erin hears the floor creak as george steps into the doorway
tell me something george
what kind of god lets a beautiful little year old girl get brain cancer
isnt he supposed to be in charge of stuff like that
make sure it doesnt happen
beat i swear any other job hed be fired
ed and erin are walking down the street take out coffee cups in their hands
ed is sipping his but erin is in too much of a lather to drink hers
thats crazy why not
because i said no
look the only reason pg es even talking to us is cause this is a quiet little real estate dispute
we add plaintiffs and suddenly were in the middle of a toxic tort with a statute problem against a massive utility
no thank you
they go into their office building
erin and ed are riding up
okay so heres what ill do
ill go on up to ted and rita daniels two of the nicest people youd ever hope to meet who spend every single day watching their little girl fight like
a dog against this cancer ill tell them we cant help them cause you dont feel like working that hard
its not about working hard bullshit
its about being realistic
something like this erin it could take forever
theyre a huge corporation
theyd completely bury us in paperwork
im just one guy with a shitty little p
who happens to know they poisoned people and lied about it
the doors open
ed gets off
erins dogging ed down the hall to the office
and this shit is bad news mr
not only does it attack every organ of the body it fucks with your dna too
that means these peoples genes and the genes of their kids and the genes of their grandkids i know how dna works erin he gets to the masry vititoe doors
erin tails ed back to his office
we can get these people
with a little effort i really think we can nail their asses to the wall
oh you do
with all your legal expertise you believe that
i dont know shit about shit
but i know the difference he shuts his office door on her
ed goes over to his desk sits down
he sees a stack of messages there starts flipping through them
then he stops
he shoves the messages aside and puts his head in his hands
he sits like that for a moment groans to himself
then he pushes himself up and heads over to his door
when he opens it he finds erin still standing there exactly where he left her arms crossed
she hasnt budged
how many families we talking about here
you think theres more
well i found one document at the water board that had a toxic test well reading from
a hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then
ed pauses groans again realizing what decision hes making
this is a whole different ball game erin
a much bigger deal
kinda like david and whats his name
kinda like david and whats his names whole fucking family
heavy sigh okay heres the deal if and only if you find me the evidence to back all this up ill do it
ill take it on
she smiles victoriously
youre doing the right thing mr
remind me of that when im filing for bankruptcy
he heads back to his desk
erin follows him into his office
course gathering evidence now thats a big job
a hell of a lot bigger than just filing
im gonna be working a lot harder now taking on a lot more responsibility
he gives her a look
knows whats coming
another raise wouldnt hurt
and with all the time im gonna be spending on the road ill probably be needing my own cel phone wont i
as erin tries to program numbers into its speed dial
widen to see she is reading from the phones manual as she enters toys r us with george matthew katie and beth
you each can pick out four things
but nothing huge
look at the price
matthew and katie fan out into the store
erin keeps messing with the phone
you can buy em all the toys you want but come monday when you split again theyre still gonna be pissed
erin looks over at him weary
george i am just trying to do something nice for my kids on my one day off
could you please not give me a hard time about it
one toy per kid is doing something nice
well hell i guess thats it then huh
theyre scarred for life
theyre gonna start holding up s any day now
im just saying with intensity i know what youre saying and i dont wanna hear it
i am doing the best i can
and she walks away from him
erin in high heels and miniskirt is straddling a ditch scooping clumps of gunky moss from the ditch into plastic containers
over this dr
frankel its erin brockovich
tell me something if i wanna find as much evidence of hexavalent chromium contamination as i possibly can what should i do
as erin labels the containers her heels slide down the side of the ditch and she lands smack in it knee deep in gunk
erin now completely dirty is climbing over a fence marked no trespassing
her arms are full of more containers
well what you have to remember is if you have hex chrom in the water you have it in anything that lived off the water
she adds them to a growing collection of containers in the trunk of her car
this time its raining
erin minces her way down to the deep end of the pool in her spike heels
what id do is start a collection
anything that existed in water on water under water she gets to the deep end and scoops up a ziploc full of rancid pool water and seals it
anything that had water flow over or under it
erin spots a few dead frogs in the water
she picks one up by the leg and seals it in a plastic bag as well
with a sample cup held in her teeth erin hauls herself up over the wells concrete wall then with her back against one side of the well and her feet
against the other starts shimmying down the well
anything that had water pass through it
she winces at the algae and gook thats clinging to her as she descends to the water level
when shes low enough she takes the sample cup from her teeth and scoops up the water
erins at her desk bending over her notebook in a miniskirt adding reports to the toxicology binder
collect em label em then bring em to me
ill analyze em see what we got
on the reports we catch a few words water sample a
soil sample d
frog sample a
traces of hexavalent
brenda looks at erin and sees her hem rising in the back
for gods sake erin i can see your panties
erin turns to brenda relishing the chance to irritate her
im not wearing any
ed in his office laughs
hes starting to like this gal
its a hot night
george is playing on the floor with the kids
erin is behind them on the couch laboriously reading a book labeled simply chromium
the phone rings
erin picks it up
is this the erin pattee brockovich thats been snooping around the water board
his voice is flat creepy
erin stares at the phone freaked
george watches erin double checking the locks on the door
im not gonna quit cause of one creepy phone call george
come on erin
a jobs supposed to pay your bills not put you in danger
im not in danger
i have a dead bolt
she goes to the living room double checks the window locks in there
look dont take this the wrong way but dont you think you might be out of your league here
no see thats exactly what those arrogant pg e fucks want me to think that because they got all this money and power we dont stand a chance in hell
but you know what
she heads into the bedrooms
it doesnt have to be this complicated erin
theres a lot of jobs out there
off hand how would you know
george reacts a little stung
he follows her into matt and katie are asleep
erin is checking their windows
george comes in
you mind telling me what thats supposed to mean
if you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job just say so
i didnt say that
cause i can get a job
and you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again
would that make you happy
keep your voice down
i know what they can sleep through erin
i probably know it better than you
she gives him a glare then leaves the room
erin is reaching up to a high shelf for a dusty old box of files
out of the corner of her eye she sees ross passing
tell me something
does pg e pay you to cover their ass or do you just do it out of the kindness of your heart
a bad liar i dont know what youre talking about
the fuck you dont
no one calls me pattee
that heavy breathing sicko that called the other night couldve only found out about me from you
beat people are dying ross
you got document after document here right under your nose that says why and you havent said word one about it
i wanna know how the hell you sleep at night
ross is speechless
he just stands there
erin drags the box to the floor and goes to work
erins car is parked in front
a dirty old pick up comes rumbling up the road
when its lights hit erins car it slows then pulls over
the driver flicks on his brights to get a better look at the car
the truck sits there for a bit a dark presence
then as the headlights of another car appear down the road the truck goes back in gear pulls out and drives off
a pile of documents is strapped into the passenger seat
an empty coffee cup rolls around the floor
erins driving exhausted
she yawns as she dials her phone
intercut between erin in her car and george in bed
im so tired im about to drive off the road
keep me awake willya
what do you want a joke
no no jokes i gotta pee
just tell me about your day
what went on back there
well come to think of it we did have a big event around here
beth started talking
we were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said ball
erin says nothing just stares out at the empty highway feeling all hollowed out
id never seen that before someones first word
erin just nods
keeps staring straight ahead as a tear rolls down her cheek
close on some files as erin hands them to ed
as he takes them from her he notices a crematory urn on erins desk
is that what i think it is
she lived on the plume
you never know
ed laughs and hands the documents to brenda without looking at her
she grumpily takes them over to the fax machine
close on the fax led as brenda types in the number
the recipients name comes up again pg e claims dept
open pits pony rides watermelon
george is watching katie and matt being led around on ponies an activity that stopped being fun hours ago
now theyre just hot and tired
by the barbecue ed is talking to an older couple as they sign retainer agreements
elsewhere erin holding beth is looking at pictures of a swimming pool with five other women
the water is green
this was the community pool
yeah that pg e built
the whole time we thought it was algae that made it so green
erins trunk is open
she and ed are clipping new clusters of retainer agreements into the plaintiffs binder
erin and ed are passing out informational pamphlets
she sticks one in a hand before noticing that its georges
im bored and so are the kids
just a few more minutes then we can go
as he heads off take her will you
george drops the pamphlet and takes beth from erin
he heads over to matt and katie sitting glumly on a log
as he steps away a hand reaches down and grabs the flier he dropped
it belongs to a man in a black jacket
hes in his s strong and sinewy
military style dark glasses obscure his eyes
he scans the pamphlet then watches erin working the crowd
watches her carefully
he slides the pamphlet into his inside pocket and heads back his car the dirty old pick up truck that idled in front of the water board
erin is heading over to george and the kids ready to leave when donna comes up to her with a middle aged man in tow
erin this heres frank melendez
he works over at the compressor station erin stops in her tracks very interested
erin and frank are on a bench talking
out of the corner of her eye she sees her car drive off
georges hand sticks out the drivers side and flips her the bird
she watches him disappear then hiding her rage turns back to frank
what were you saying
the barbecue is winding down
ed is heading for his mercedes
erin storms up beside him mad as all get out
i need a ride
ed is driving
he glances over at erin fuming in the passenger seat
after a beat you wanna talk about no another beat
then erins cel phone rings
she digs into her bag pulling it out as fast as she can
theres a pause
then mike ambrosinos voice comes over the line very strained um erin
this is mike
the curtains are drawn everything is dark
ed and erin are at the door talking to mike who looks drawn and tired
she was about to take a handful of these he shows them a bottle of prescription pills
its a morphine thing for pain erin nods then leaves ed with mike and heads toward erin opens the door
very dark very quiet
laura is lying in bed
erin goes over to her
they speak in whispers
its just the pain
its only getting worse
i cant be a good wife
i cant be a good mother
im real sorry laura
erin sits down on the chair next to the bed
takes a beat
know what i always thought i wanted outta life erin
jaguars a darn pretty car
i thought if i could spend that kinda money on a car itd mean everything else was fine
beat i dont even know how much they cost
but you hang in there maybe youll get one
laura shakes her head
wouldnt mean the same thing
erin watches her sadly
a loud industrial plant
erin and frank melendez walk through him in coveralls her in a teensy sun dress
both in hard hats
hes giving her a tour
george in his leather and denim is walking down the sidewalk
as we widen we see hes pushing a pink stroller
he stops at a crosswalk waiting for the light to change
in the stroller beth starts to whine
george reaches in his pocket finds her pacifier
as hes leaning down to give it to her he hears a rumble coming down the street behind him
the roar grows
he stands looks
a group of about ten bikers has pulled up next to him
he looks at them
they look at him then at the stroller
george feels ridiculous
when the light changes the bikers rev loudly and pull out
george just stands there and watches them go
his office is all about hinkley
a map of the plume area and a diagram of the plant cover one wall photos of the plant cover the credenza piles of documents litter every surface erin is
up at the map eating chinese food
they used the hex chrom here in these cooling tanks as an anti corrosive
then they dumped it here in these six ponds
i dont remember seeing any ponds up there
she bites into a forkful of food keeps talking
they covered em over
and not too carefully either cause you dig one inch under the surface and the dirt is green as a fucking shamrock
and thats what caused the contamination
it didnt help but no
the real problems on the bottom
she reaches for a document reads from it
see according to this they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit couldnt seep into the ground
but guess what they skipped that step
i guess it was a little too inconvenient
so for fourteen years this stuff flowed into the groundwater free as you please
beat i dont even wanna ask what you did to make this melendez guy talk
in response to the insinuation erin gives him a glare
for your information frank cares what was in those ponds cause he used to spend half his day wading around them
that was his job
no suddenly her eyes pop out of her head shit
tears spring to her eyes
she fans furiously at her mouth
ed finds the tequila from the client and hands it to her
she takes a swig
theres a nanosecond of relief
until the tequila hits
her eyes redden
she spews and gasps
asshole ed chuckles
the tequilas been dipped into
ed and erin are each lying on a couch staring at documents
late night working
erin lemme tell you something
if ida put three researchers on this i wouldnt expect them to dig up all the information you got here
this is some damn good work
then gimme another raise
hey i got a staff to pay plus rent plus i havent billed a minute of my time since i started on this case so you can quit hitting me
up like im rich or something
he gets up grabs his trash can and moves around the room with it cleaning up all the chinese food cartons
dont give me that
youre gonna get plenty rich off of this mr
we got those pg e fuckers by the balls here
weve got the pg e fuckers in hinkley by the balls
but nobodys getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate pg e fuckers in san francisco
what do you mean
pg e corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in hinkley
oh they knew
they had to know
show me the document that proves that
she doesnt have one
then they didnt know
and if they didnt know we cant hit em for punitive damages
and punitive damages is where the money is
jesus christ ed you know the more i work on this thing the more i realize what a crock of shit this legal system is
here we got a company that poisoned a whole aquifer that built a pool for a town then filled it with toxic water and were the ones whove gotta bust
our ass proving things
thats just not right
i like this case
it makes me sick
thats why i like it
its been a long time since i had a case i cared about
you didnt care about my case
i would now
he gives her a long look
i like working with you
well good ed
i like working with you too
they both smile a little awkwardly
take a beat
then whend you start calling me ed
the christmas party
the office is decorated someone is santa
erin and george enter all dressed up
erins giving george a guided tour
as they head down the hall every desk is decorated and has a present on it im just saying we have one night to ourselves why do we have to
spend it here
cause its my office party
if you had an office id go to your party
the door to erins area opens
and here ta daa is my desk
she flicks on the lights
brendas desk is decorated and as a present on it
erins is empty
its obvious maybe they didnt think you were coming
erin shakes her head
shes surprised by how hurt she is
quietly god damn
i work so hard
the least they could do
george looks over at her sees her eyes glisten a little
he goes over to her wraps his arms around her
fuck em babe
who needs em huh
he kisses her
she leans into him
he kisses her some more
all we need is each other
she kisses back
shes gonna let him take care of her
some more kisses heating up
he slides her onto her empty desk
good thing there isnt a present there huh
that mighta hurt
she laughs a little
he slides his hands up her skirt
she pulls him into her tugging his shirt out of his pants
ed is coming down the hall with his wife joey
joey is much younger than ed and very pretty
ill show you what we did back here erin and george in a rapidly heating up clinch on her desk hear the voices
erin pulls away
lock the door
no i wanna say hi
he pulls her back into him not wanting to move
well say hi later
but erin pulls away
come on george its a party
he watches her straighten her dress and take a step away from him
its just one step but it feels a hell a lot farther
erin and ed are at the reception desk talking and laughing
nearby joey and george are standing together awkwardly
your wifes real pretty
shes not my wife
matthew lies awake in his bed listening to george and erin fight
it wouldnt kill you to talk about something other than yourself and your own fucking job once in a while what do you want to talk about instead
thats a fascinating subject
erin and george are fighting while they get ready for bed
just cause i dont spend all day trying to prove what hot shit i am that is not what im bull shit erin
the fight is interrupted by the sound of beth crying
thank you very much
she leaves the room
beth is wailing in her crib
erin comes in in her nightshirt and lifts beth out
then more to herself than to beth its okay baby
itll be okay
she runs her hand over beths head then slides down the wall and crumples onto the floor
as she curls around beth erin starts to cough
deep raspy coughs from way down low
late late at night
the plant is silent
the property seems empty until we notice pete irving standing alone inside the gates staring up at the station
after a beat he picks up a rock and hurls it at the plant
not that it would do anything if it hit
he reaches for another throws it
then another and another
he hurls rock after rock at the gigantic plant
then overwhelmed by his impotence he lets out a terrifying yell
donnas sitting quietly in bed
erin is sitting on the edge of the bed
id got so used to having em come up benign i guess i just didnt expect it
she looks down her shirt front
sure wish i had longer to get used to the idea
beat you think if you got no uterus and no breasts youre still technically a woman
sure you are
youre just a happier woman cause you dont have to deal with maxi pads and underwire
donna smiles a little
then her face crumbles
were gonna get them arent we erin
you gotta promise me were gonna get them
as documents are faxed once again to the pg e claims dept
then again on another day
and again on another day
ed is once again checking the lie of his tie in a window
erin is popping some aspirin trying to kill a headache that has brought with it a healthy dose of intolerance
if theyve sent that little shmuck baum again im gonna be real pissed off
from their tone of voice on the phone id say theyre taking us more seriously
yeah i heard that one before
brenda leans her head in
buda and ms
cooper from pg e are here
talk about moving up the food chain
buda and mr
cooper mill slowly about the reception area like sharks
they all ooze importance
erin ed and brenda are staring out at them
they look like the secret service
theyre trying to intimidate us
then to brenda tell them to wait in the conference room
sanchez webster buda and cooper are seated
the door opens and ed enters legal pad under his arm
followed by erin legal pad under her arm
followed by anna looking professional in brendas suit coat legal pad under her arm
followed by mario in a suit produced from who knows where legal pad under his arm
if you didnt know better youd assume it was a team of lawyers as well
ed and erin sit down and get to work
mario and anna clearly told to just follow along sit down a moment later
mario and anna are sitting mutely in their seats beside ed and erin firing blank looks across the table
lets be honest here
two million dollars is more money than these people have ever dreamed of
erin has no patience for this today
oh see now that pisses me off
first of all we got moren a hundred plaintiffs
they may not be sophisticated but they do know how to divide and two million dollars isnt shit when its split between them
mario and anna exchange a look
this is getting interesting
erin but theres no stopping her
and second of all these people dont dream about being rich
they dream about being able to watch their kids swim in a pool without worrying theyll have to have a hysterectomy at age like rosa diaz a client of ours
or have their spine deteriorate like stan bloom
another client of ours
so before you come back here with another lame ass offer i want you to think real hard about what your spine is worth mr
buda or what youd expect someone to pay you for your uterus miss sanchez then you take out your calculator and multiply that number by a hundred
anything less than that is a waste of our time
and she gets up and storms out of the meeting
erin drinks a big swig of coffee and pops a few more aspirin
beyond her the pg e lawyers are filing out of the office
anna wanders over to erin a little uncomfortable
erin turns listen
even though youre not necessarily my favorite person in the world
beat sometimes youre not half bad
im gonna assume that was meant as a compliment anna and just say thank you
erins at her desk which is completely buried in documents and files
shes visibly exhausted struggling to focus on the page and coughing while she works
ed calls to her
a new plaintiff called wants to meet you
i told him wed be out there thursday
dyou get his name
no answer course not
jesus ed he said hed be at the gas station at six
boy this job takes me to some of the best damn places huh
erin is sitting out front swigging cough syrup from the bottle
she checks her watch
the gas station attendant comes out locks up and turns out the lights
this is the only station in town right
he gets in his car and drives off
erin sits down again
looks down the road in both directions
then she spots behind some bushes across the street a glint of chrome
she shields her eyes against the sunset and sees the beat up truck parked behind some shrubbery
erin looks around realizes shes alone
as she looks back at the truck the ash of a cigarette brightens in the cab
she realizes shes being watched
the drivers door opens
erin bolts for her car scrambling to find her keys
she jumps in locks her doors and tries to start her car but it wont turn over
the man in the dark glasses has gotten out and is heading toward her car
erin looks around again
not a soul
she tries the engine again
just as he gets to her car the engine engages
erin peels out of the gas station
erin drives down the road hyperventilating trying to focus on the road
she looks in the rear view mirror nothing
she reaches the train tracks
a train is passing
she has to stop
as shes waiting the glint of headlights bounce off her rear view mirror
truck lights coming her way
she looks at the train still passing then back at the headlights closing in on her
the train the headlights the train the headlights
finally when the headlights are right behind her the last train car zips by
erin peels out bounding her rickety car over the tracks
the truck follows
the hyundai zips down the road
and behind it the truck
she looks out at the landscape around her
no other cars on the road
she starts to panic accelerates
the hyundai going faster
the truck still following
erin comes up on a stop sign
she runs it
so does the truck
a little later she makes a turn and sees the lost cause saloon
in the parking lot like a lifeboat sits eds mercedes
she pulls into the drive and jumps out of her car
ed is eating ribs when erin bursts through the door
she rushes over to him near tears with fear and exhaustion
someones following me
some guy in a truck he waited till i was alone then he followed me like two miles
jesus im shaking
get me a beer
ed gets up and heads toward the door
to the counter guy beer please
as ed looks out the door erin collapses onto a bench
what kind of truck
i dont know
back to the table did you get a license plate
or a make
no ed what with me running for my life i didnt have time to check those things i was just asking
are you all right
ed looks at her
she looks terrible
shaky tired drawn
jesus you look like shit
when was the last time you had a decent nights sleep
crappy and pink
eds mercedes pulls into the parking lot
erins hyundai follows
ed stops gets out
ed swings by erins open car window
im getting two rooms
erin and ed amble down the porch checking door numbers each rattling a key
they find their adjacent rooms and stop
erin leans against the wall too weak to stand
lock the door every which way you can
and if theres anything funny sound whatever pound on the wall
ill come right over
she nods a little
then before she goes into her room i think you should know theres very few people in the world who dont piss me off percent of the time
beat youre one of em
its as tender as she gets and hes moved by it
they look at each other
maybe even considering
but after a long beat she reaches for her door again
im triple locking my door so dont even think of trying to take advantage
she smiles goes inside
he watches her close her door behind her before going inside himself
george is sitting alone on the stoop drinking a beer
music is coming from his house next door
he stares out into the street with a lot on his mind
katie and matt are making a mess of breakfast
beth is on the floor grinding cereal into the linoleum
erin enters having just gotten home and sees the mayhem
what are you doing wheres george
i dont know
she heads out
george is sitting on the bed when erin enters
jesus george theyre turning the kitchen into a hellhole
you know you cant leave them alone like that
he doesnt answer
she notices this
whats going on
what are you doing
hes very calm
he holds out a small jewelry box
its a pair of earrings
i saw em in the mall one day and i thought damn those would look good on those beautiful earlobes
so i bought em
and i said to myself next time erin says something nice does something nice ill surprise her with em
beat know how long ago that was
in six months you havent said one nice thing to me
thats a long time
im just working so hard i know
he stands i think you oughta either find a different job or a different boyfriend
cause there may be men who dont mind being the maid and getting nothing in return but im sure as shit not one of em
i cant leave my job george
yeah you can
you could just quit
people do it all the time
look this job its the best thing that ever happened to me
i mean it
for the first time in my life i got people respecting me
up in hinkley i walk into a room and everyone shuts up just to hear what i got to say
i never had that
dont ask me to give it up
i need it
more than you need me
i need it
he nods then stands to leave
maybe you didnt like who you were before erin but i did
thats who i fell in love with
only then does she see the packed duffel bag in the corner
you already packed up your stuff
i pretty much knew what your answer was gonna be
he picks it up and walks out the door tossing the earring box on the bed as he goes
erin is at her window looking out at the street below
george is strapping a couple of bags onto the back of his bike
he gets on the bike starts it up and drives away
erin is driving looking weary
her kids are in the car
matthew turns on the radio
erin reaches over and turns it off
matthew turns it back on
erin glares at him turns it off
on off on off
a test of wills
finally when matthew turns it on one more time erin turns it off yanks the knob off the stereo and throws it out the window
the hyundai pulls into the lot
erin parks the car unclips her seat belt
she gets out
business as usual
erin comes in goes straight to her desk
erin flips through her in box looking for something in particular
doesnt find it
she heads off to jane is at her desk when erin comes in
wheres my paycheck
have you been logging on
i moved payroll onto the computer
it only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night
seething now howm i supposed to do that when im not in here most mornings and nights
im sure youll think of something
erin glares at her
i dont believe this then turns and storms out of janes office
ed is on the phone when erin barges in rage in her eyes
i want my fucking money into phone im sorry im gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here puts the call on hold then to erin
do you mind
seething yeah i mind
you bet your ass i mind
clearly shes in a dander hes going to have to deal with
you wanna tell me what the problem is here or its my paycheck
which i earned
which i deserve
which i shouldnt have to beg for
that fat ass bitch wont give it to me
erin youre a big girl
if you got a problem with jane work it out for yourself
i dont have time to deal with fuck you
cause i bust my ass for you
i watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet for you
and what do you do for me
you see the way im treated around here but have you ever stood up for me once
have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work im doing
have you ever bothered saying hey erin doesnt get paid the most cause she has the best tits she gets paid the most cause shes the best god damn employee
ive ever had
is that what you want
i want my paycheck
by the end of the day
realizes hes going to have to take this on
ill see what i can do
you might want to think real hard about the amount too
my kids are sitting in the god damn parking lot right now cause i still dont make enough to afford good child care
makes me think about looking around for a job where im appreciated for shits sake
she storms out
erin is standing at the sink visibly exhausted trying to do the dinner dishes with one arm and comfort beth whos crying with the other
matthew comes in
can i play roller hockey
the doorbell rings
erin goes to get it
matthew follows matthew is dogging erin on this
beth is still crying
randys mom said yes right away
snapping well god damn it matthew randys mom doesnt work eighteen hour days and randys dad didnt leave her so figuring out whos gonna take who where is a little
easier over at randys house
erin opens the door
a messenger is there
package from masry vititoe
he hands her a manila envelope
she signs for the package then tears into it as the messenger heads away
a check and a set of keys fall out
she looks at the check
its made out for
a note attached reads hire a erin looks up and sees a brand new chevy blazer parked on the curb
she looks at the keys in her hand
erin drives up in the blazer pulls into a parking space
eds seated at a table alone
erin walks by the door then spots him and stops in the doorway
believe it or not i wouldve been satisfied with just the check
ed turns sees her
well you go threatening to leave i cant take any chances
youre the only person around who understands what im doing
things come up i gotta know i got someone to turn to
she sits reading him
what kind of things come up
things like the head counsel for pg e calling me with an offer
beat million plus attorneys fees
take it or leave it
its about thousand per plaintiff
so what are you thinking
i wish someone else had to make this decision
beat thousand bucks is more than any other california toxic plaintiff has gotten
but it wont cover annabelle danielss medical bills
and its less than pocket change for pg e
do you think wed do better by going to trial
but maybe not
we still dont have anything linking this to pg e corporate
plus theres the statute problem
plus were way short on manpower so wed need to bring on more lawyers
plus percent of millions a whole lot of money
its eight million dollars erin
eight million dollars
thats a fucking fortune ed
and you know im the last person on earth to walk away from a big payday
but you and me didnt get into this to get rich
we did it cause we both have this voice in our heads saying do the right thing get these plaintiffs what they deserve the right to live and die in
some kind of comfort and peace
if isnt gonna buy that then we gotta say no
beat trust me
if you dont do the right thing for these people getting that million dollars is gonna feel like shit
he nods to himself and looks up at her his mind made up
i knew i put up with your bullshit for a reason
theyre driving through the tall buildings of century city
ed is full of nervous excitement
this guy erin hes got more toxic tort experience than anyone else in california
and he said yes to me on the first phone call right off the bat
points to a building thats it
the big one
theyve got the top three floors
it feels more like the lobby of a five star hotel than an office
erin and ed step off the elevator
who do they represent god
so do me a favor and behave yourself for once
to receptionist ed masry to see kurt potter
as ed turns to check his reflection a young lawyer comes through the reception area
erin watches him pass then still miffed calls out to him
scuse me sir you got a real nice ass you know that
the lawyer double takes on her then retreats into the office
erin turns to ed smiles
oh im sorry
was that not what you meant by behaving myself
theresa dellavalle junior partner comes out to greet them
shes everything erin isnt conservative restrained unemotional
and about as sexy as a station wagon
good to see you again
theresa hey this is erin brockovich
theresa leads ed and erin down a long hall of teak desks
the sound of their footfalls is swallowed up by the plush carpeting
occasional attorneys and paralegals glance at erin
she feels their stares
potter is sitting behind his giant desk when theresa leads ed and erin in
kurt ed masrys here
and this is erin brockovich eds assistant
erin this is kurt potter
to ed with a wink well
now i know what you meant when you called her your secret weapon
erin gives ed another look
what the fuck
ed gives her a firm look back
potter ed erin theresa and few paralegals are sitting around the table
as the conversation ping pongs between ed and potter potter completely ignores erin
whend they file the demur
whats a demur
its pg e saying to the judge that we dont have a case
their lawyers go how many counts
weve got good answers to all of em
reasons pg e thinks it shouldnt go to whos the judge
hes got a reputation for doing all his how longs he gonna take
erins starting to steam at potter
theresa sees it brewing tries to intercede
you know what
why dont i take erin down the hall so we can start in on this stuff
erin notices all her files in stacks against the wall
hey those are my files yeah we had them couriered over
and listen good work
theyre a great start
were just going to have to spend a little time filling in the holes in your research
okay these people are starting to piss her off
excuse me theresa was it
there are no holes in my research
there are just some things we need that you probably didnt know to ask
dont talk to me like im an idiot okay
i may not have a law degree but ive spent months on this case and i know more about those plaintiffs than you ever will
you dont even have phone numbers for some of them
whose number do you need
this is a lawsuit
we need to be able to contact the plaintiffs
i said whose number do you need you dont know six hundreds plaintiffs numbers by heart
erin just stares at her
theresa sighs reluctantly glances down at a file
as theresa starts to write it down years old in may

she had a tumor in her brain stem detected last november had an operation on thanksgiving shrunk it with radiation after that

ted grew up in hinkley

erin glares at theresa indignant
okay look i think we got off on the wrong foot here thats all you got lady
two wrong feet
in fucking ugly shoes
its still raining
erin is following ed to the car
she insulted me
it was a misunderstanding
but instead of handling it politely instead of treating her with respect why the fuck should i respect her
ed stops in his tracks furious
he glares at her
because thats how people treat each other not in my world
gee i wonder why
on that he gets in his car slams the door and drives off leaving her standing alone in the pouring rain
youre my ride
potter and ed are walking down the hallway mid conversation
a few paralegals follow them with files
ive also been thinking about the team
responsibilities who should cover what right
i think we should makes some changes
bob linwood is in his barn mucking it out
theresa is at the edge of the property trying unsuccessfully to get his attention by yelling and waving her arms
in her expensive shoes shes stopped short of the cow patty minefield
close on a client file as a hand fills in a phone number
widen to see erin seated with a paralegal rattling off facts and numbers from memory
shes seized by a coughing fit
theresa still hasnt gotten linwoods attention
finally rather than ruin her shoes she picks up a stone and tosses it at the barn
it hits the window and breaks it
erins desk is empty no erin no files nothing
ed comes out of his office and hands brenda a stack of documents
brenda types in the number
the recipients i
comes up again only this time it says potter hughes rosewood
a secretary carries the documents to potters office
on the way she passes the conference room
inside erin is still dictating to the paralegal
shes shivery with fever now
the floor around her is littered with tissues
theresa is talking to rita and ted daniels
annabelle is curled up on the sofa wrapped up in a blanket
rita and ted notice that theresa doesnt even look at annabelle
erin is lying in bed home sick talking on the phone
shes talking over the noise of tania her something eastern european nanny vacuuming the hall
i know she isnt real warm but they say shes a real good lawyer
ted daniels is on the phone
rita is next to him
that may be
but i dont want her coming to the house again
shes kinda stuck up and she upsets annabelle
now i hate to say this but when she left today rita asked if we should get a new lawyer
ted no dont do that
if you dont like theresa you dont have to work with her
me and ed are still here for you
i called ed two days ago erin and he still hasnt called me back
the phone rings
brenda picks up
ed masrys office
sorry he cant be interrupted
intercut with erin at home still in bed so irritated
dont be a pain in the ass okay brenda
just put him on
with finality i said he cant be interrupted
erin hangs up
then with a groan she pulls her weary body out of bed
erin drags herself into the office
hey erin i thought you were taking a sick day
so did i
she heads toward eds office but stops when she sees a meeting in progress in the conference room
ed is on the side of the table facing her flanked by potter and theresa
on the other side of the table are four suited backs
whats going on in there
with pg e people
pg are you sure
they must be important too cause they came on a special plane
erin feels this like a sock in the gut
she stares at the meeting stunned
this band of pg e lawyers is the oldest and most impressive of all
ed potter and theresa are listening to the most senior pg e lawyer mr
we would enter into binding arbitration judge no jury with a settlement to be between and million dollars
ed and potter hear this and think about it
any preconditions on the settlements
the plaintiffs have to agree to it unanimously
and theyre barred from ever discussing their settlement with anyone
million dollars isnt a whole hell of a lot of money for your company mr
million dollars is a great deal of money for your plaintiffs mr
as ed mulls this he sees beyond mr
corbin staring at him from the other side of the glass wall her face cold with hurt and anger
could i just take a brief break here for a moment
ill be right back
he gets up and goes out into ed comes out
erins so angry she can barely breathe
if you tell me to relax im gonna kick your fucking head off erin its just a meeting
people dont fly down in their own god damn plane for just a meeting look you said you werent feeling great
i thought you should rest
youd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you
its an important meeting
kurt thought if it was just lawyers kurt thought
what about you
do you think anymore
he resists being dragged into an knock down drag out fight
look this is serious now
theyre talking serious money and what im not serious
you say any god damn thing that comes into your head
and im not saying thats bad
that can be great that can be a lot of fun fun
jesus fun i kill myself for a year and a half hand you the best case of your life on a god damn silver platter remind you of why you
became a lawyer in the first place and you think of me as fun
okay now youre making this personal and it isnt not personal thats my work in there ed
my sweat my labor my time
if thats not personal i dont know what is
she starts to cough and crumble but fights it
weakened how dare you take that away from me
no ones taking anything bullshit
you stuck me in siberia dictating to some god damn steno clerk so you could finish this thing without me
after all ive done for you thats the thanks i get
by now the entire office is watching
as are the lawyers in the conference room
dont give me that
youve gotten plenty
youve been well paid youve gotten lots of perks
jesus perks erin reaches into her bag pulls out her cel phone
if this piece of shit is supposed to take the place of your respect you can take it and shove it up your ass
she throws it at him and storms away
the phone hits the glass wall of the conference room cracking it
ed just stands there with the lawyers staring at him through the splintered glass wall
erin gets to her car
as she opens the door the alarm sounds
she fumbles with her keychain trying to turn it off but shes too sick and upset to figure it out
with the siren still blaring she kicks at the car in rage
erins driving home
as she turns onto her street her headlights wash across the sidewalk and illuminate a small boy wearing a backpack walking the other way
holy shit she looks over her shoulder but the sidewalk is too dark
she pulls a u turn in the middle of the street
a car honks
erin scans the sidewalk finally sees him again
holy shit is right
its matthew wandering the streets at night
matthew she pulls ahead of matthew and bumps up onto the sidewalk blocking his path
when he sees her car he turns and runs the other way
erin leaps out and follows him
she catches up and collars him
god damn it matthew
what the hell are you doing out here
im gonna go live with george
music is playing
tania is on the phone
the receiver is yanked from her hand
she turns to see erin hovering over her barely containing herself
if you leave here real fast i might not kill you
matthews in his bed facing the wall
erin sitting on the foot of his bed near tears
katies watching from her bed
well work out the roller hockey thing okay
whatever you want well work it out
you always say that
then you go to work and forget you promised
i never forget honey
i try real hard
its just for some reason i dont seem to be able to organize things right and when it comes to you guys i end up falling short
you never fall short for the work people
i guess maybe you just love them more
oh god sweetheart no
theres nothing on earth i love more than you
beat i promise
she lays her hand on his shoulder but he shrugs it off and inches away from her
erin comes out of the bedroom
as she turns to close the door she collapses to the floor in a heap
a busy southland er
george bursts through the doors with katie matthew and beth in tow
he goes up to the desk
im looking for erin brockovich
they brought her in in an ambulance
the kids are waiting
george is talking to a doctor
what the hell is meningitis
its an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain
she must be a tough cookie cause its a pretty advanced case
id say shes been walking around with it for a few weeks now
how does someone get meningitis
usually in adults its from exposure to bacteria or a virus or
or lemme guess toxic waste
matt and katie sit on the cheap plastic chairs outside the room
katie is holding beth whos sleeping
they can stay at my place till you go home
erins in bed hooked up to an iv looking exhausted
all untouched food tray is beside her bed
george is standing across the room from her arms crossed tight across his chest keeping his distance
they said thatd be tomorrow
they just wanna keep an eye on me another night
ill drop em off tomorrow afternoon
a moment of thick silence
giving nothing mm hm
as she watches him reach for his motorcycle helmet to leave shes hit with a wave of regret
george hang on
he pauses look
i just theres a knock at the door and ed enters
george looks at him
not interested in her apologies
ill drop em by tomorrow
and erin watches george leave the room then turns to ed
if youre here to fire me your timings lousy
im not gonna fire you
beat i wanted to
but then you got sick and that woulda made me look like a shit
serious you embarrassed me erin
beat do i get to hear what happened anyway
ed has taken off his coat and pulled a chair up next to erins bed
hes eating the pudding off her tray
between and million definitely
and if you had to guess
with nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet id say well end up on the lower end of that
still a lot of money
so why would pg e offer it
they know the evidence they know theyre gonna lose a jury trial
maybe they wouldnt lose million bucks but once you factor in all theyd spend on this case in the next ten years it makes a lot of wait what do
you mean ten years
five years maybe for a trial
double that for the appeal
confused im sorry are you saying that if this thing goes to trial itll be ten years before these plaintiffs see their money
hey thats not so bad
compare it to the love canal that was twenty years ago and those people still havent seen a dime
so in legal terms ten years is fuck legal terms
were talking about human beings here
a whole bunch of them are gonna be dead in ten years
they need their money now
beat we gotta get em to agree to the arbitration ed
we gotta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to i know were having a meeting its all set up when
tuesday at seven at the hinkley firehouse
i think i should be the one to tell em cause they trust me more than youre not gonna be there
the fuck im not
i dont care what the doctor says this isnt doctors orders
im saying you cant come
because kurt doesnt want to work with you
he thinks youre a loose cannon
erin no im serious
you know what kurt potter is
hes the kind of guy who never would have taken this case in the first place
hes the kind of guy who would have sold these plaintiffs down the river when pg e offered million
he doesnt work like us ed
theres no little voice in his head telling him to do the right thing
but his minds made up
he stands to leave
dont come erin
i mean it
if you do im gonna have to fire you
concentrate on getting well
the parking lot is empty except for three mercedes
ed potter and theresa are in the doorway going over their notes
a truck pulls into the lot
katie and matt are watching tv
beth is playing near them
behind them erin is lying on the couch under a blanket distractedly trying to watch tv
she checks her watch
the lot is filling with more cars and trucks headlights criss cross each other as people pull in from all directions
erins sitting up now jiggling her knee unable to sit still
she checks her watch again
she cant take it
she throws off the blanket and gets up
come on kids were going for a ride
close on hands
as people stream in they are each handed a release form with a space for a signature on the bottom
the room packed with plaintiffs hums with horse flies and tension
people are fanning themselves with the release forms
potters addressing them from a raised platform
ed theresa and andrew are seated behind him
binding arbitration isnt all that different from a trial
its overseen by a judge
evidence is presented in much the same way
one more car pulls into the lot
its erins chevy
erin unbuckles her seat belt
stay in the car babies i wont be long
erin gets out of the car looks around then goes over to a window and looks in at the packed meeting
and then a jury decides
no sorry i should have mentioned that
theres no jury in binding arbitration
no jury and no appeal
she climbs up on an old wagon for a better view
so what are our options if we dont like the result
well you have none
the judges decision is final
but i really dont anticipate that as a problem
now in addition to the stifling heat the large room is thick with mistrust
people are shifting in their seats whispering to each other
you dont even know what its gonna be how do you know were gonna like it
agreeing murmurs ripple through the crowd
as i said before it will definitely be somewhere between and million dollars
theres a big difference there
i wouldnt want to speculate at this point
ed what do you think itll be
potter turns around and looks at ed seated behind him
we shouldnt speculate
so then what that mystery numbers divided up at the whim of some judge judges dont make decisions based on whim maam
they make them based on precedent and evidence
the grumble of discontent has overtaken the room
more whispering more movement
erin watches the meeting fall apart
its driving her crazy
fucking idiot potter sees hes losing them too
tries to gain control
is this a big decision
but i do believe that if you put a little faith in the system youll be quite pleased with the outcome
ted daniels gets up from his seat
potter if you knew me from adam youd know that being pleased isnt an option for me anymore
now dont take this personally sir but ive never seen you before in my life
im not about to put my faith in anything just cause you tell me to
he drops his agreement form unsigned then takes ritas hand and heads for the door
the plaintiffs stream out of the firehouse
cars start up headlights flick on
people pull away
everyone has left
erin enters and looks around
the floor is littered with rejected unsigned release forms
she thinks for a moment then gets an idea
she picks up a release form and leaves the firehouse
everythings closed except the kinkos store at the far end
erins truck pulls into the parking lot
a bored employee is at the register painting with wite out on a blue piece of paper
erin enters dragging her kids
can i have one of those counter thingies please
the employee gives it to her
erin crosses to the copiers
she slips the release form into one then taps in the number of copies
the machine whirs to life
erins chevy pulls into the parking lot
i dont want to stay here
erin is entering the crappy motel room with her kids
we got no choice
im not gonna make it home tonight
now go wash up and climb into bed
as the kids wander toward the bathroom erin picks up the phone and dials
silence i got a favor to ask you
i dont do favors for you anymore
its not for me its for my kids
youre the only one i trust them with
erin is visible in the motel office talking to the clerk when georges motorcycle pulls into the lot
she turns around and sees him pulling up next to her chevy
erin comes up to him hands him a key
i got you your own room
he takes it glances toward the motel room
awkward beat look dont take any of em on your bike okay
call a cab if you wanna go somewhere
she hands him a wad of cash
how longs this whole thing gonna take
i dont know
beat thanks for helping me
i appreciate it
she gets into her car
before closing the door she turns back to him
and i miss you
yeah well good help is hard to find
she sees how mad shes made him
takes a beat
i treated you real bad george
i know that
but my problem was i never been with anyone who deserved better than that
youre the first nice guy who ever liked me
george softens shifts
he steps toward the truck and gently closes her door so hes standing close to her
didnt know how to handle it
he thinks about this
finally think you could learn
with a smile you know me
i pick things up real fast
he smiles back at her nods then tenderly brushes a piece of hair out of her eyes
you shouldnt be driving around you know
yeah but im gonna get better
a lot of these folks arent
he nods understanding
then he taps the side of her truck and turns toward the motel room
she puts the truck in gear and pulls out
erins chevy is bombing down the road
there are two boxes there one full of unsigned release forms the other empty
donnas gardening out front her head wrapped in a scarf to cover her chemo thinning hair when erins chevy pulls into the driveway
erin gets out goes to the back of the truck gets two of the release forms then heads over to donna
erin is sitting with pete and donna
i dont know erin the way he was talking to us telling us everything was gonna be fine i just didnt trust him
and after all we been through no jury no appeal
it just makes me nervous
i understand all that
and i dont wanna force you into anything
if you dont want to sign thats fine
but why dont we talk it over a little cause id sure hate for you to turn this down for the wrong reasons
the door opens
erin emerges holding two signed agreements
donna is letting her out
you wouldnt happen to have a little time right now would you donna
well i was gonna head over to the browns now
i was thinking mandy really values your opinion
erin donna mandy and tom are seated on the sofas
mandy signs an agreement
hands the pen to tom who also signs
from outside we see erin at the kitchen table with donna and bob and ruth linwood who are listening intently
erin and donna are leaving saying good bye to mary desoto
erin has a signed release form in her hand
the two boxes
the formerly empty one now has a small stack of signed release forms in it
the top one has bob linwoods signature
erin is driving eating a hamburger and going over her list of plaintiffs
people are going about their shopping
rita daniels is stopped talking with a few more plaintiffs
i thought so too but erin says a trials gonna take years the signed stack has grown the unsigned stack has shrunk
erin drops five more agreements into the signed box
in the wee hours
while her kids sleep erin sits at the cheap motel room table going through her forms organizing alphabetizing
close on erin fast asleep at the table her face pressed against the linoleum
theres some noise in the room whispering
erin stirs and looks around to see george behind her diapering beth while matt and katie put their shoes on
what time is it
were just gonna take your car to get some breakfast
erin forces herself awake
no i need my car well just be a minute
get a little more sleep
he picks up beth takes katies hand and calls across the room to matthew
leave that alone we gotta go
erin turns to see matthew holding one of her release forms
oh baby please dont play with that okay
i got em all organized
just put it back
but hes reading it
and something has caught his attention
he looks up at erin
this girls the same age as me
erin gently takes the form away from matthew wanting to shield him from the harsh realities of this case
thats right sweetheart
she replaces the form on top of the stack
shes one of the sick people
beat but you know what
thats why im helping her
so she can get some medicine to make her feel better
matthew mulls this over a bit more
how come her own mom isnt helping her
cause her own moms real sick too
matthew thinks real hard about this then heads over to the door where george beth and katie are waiting for him
before he leaves though he turns back to erin
maybe well bring you back some breakfast
you want eggs
she looks at the group of them feels their shift toward acceptance
eggsd be great baby
eggsd be perfect
erins driving along a dusty hinkley road eating cold eggs out of a take out container with her fingers
a group of men are arriving at work
erins truck pulls up
she grabs some release forms from the truck and wanders up to the men
how you all doing today
she tosses eight more agreements in the signed stack
morning drop off time
erin is handing out release forms zo a group of mothers who just dropped off their kids
erin is leaning on the hood of her truck going down her list of plaintiffs checking off the ones who have already signed
erin has set up shop here and is at a table with about five plaintiffs all reading agreements
mike ambrosino enters
erin spots him
i been looking all over for you
come here i wanna talk to you
the signed stack is getting bigger
and still bigger
close on erins trunk
a bunch more forms get thrown onto the signed stack which is now much higher than the unsigned
im gonna head out to barstow and talk to some folks out there tonight
widen to reveal erin talking on a nearby pay phone
promise youll turn around if you get tired
she hangs up
as she turns to get into her car she finds herself face to face with the man in the dark glasses
hes just standing there a foot away blocking her exit
she recognizes his truck as the one that chased her
okay whatre you gonna do
you gonna kill me
dump my body in a ditch somewhere
or maybe you just wanna inject me with some poison too why change tactics at this stage of the game
beat get outta my way you make me sick
she pushes past him
but he grabs her by the arm
hes a big guy its a strong grab
now shes scared
for a moment he does nothing
just looks at her
then if pg e made someone destroy a whole lot of documents would that matter to you
erin takes a beat realizing she completely misread him
she gently pulls her arm away
i guess that depends on what the documents were
she takes a beat im sorry i didnt get your name
erin and embry are the only patrons
erins eating a burger
embry has a beer
hes talking quietly not looking at her
i was working in the compressor and out of nowhere the supervisor calls me up to the office and says were gonna give you a shredder machine and send you
on down to the warehouse
we want you to get rid of all the documents stored out there
did he say why
and i didnt ask
did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed
well its pretty boring work shredding you gotta find some way to entertain your mind
so yeah i took a look
there was a lot of dull stuff vacation schedules the like
beat but then there were a few memos about the holding ponds
the water in them
they had readings from test wells stuff like that
erin tries to hide her excitement at this information
and you were told to destroy those
destruction of evidence
pretty big deal
erin plays it down
wipes her mouth with her napkin takes a sip of beer
course as it turns out im not a very good employee
what do you mean
there were a few documents that i somehow didnt get around to shredding
beat that i kept instead
erin stops mid bite
hes dug out an inch high stack of documents
erin looks them over stunned
embry is standing apart from her hands shoved deep in his pockets
how come you didnt say anything when you found these things
at the time i thought i got six kids some of em want to go to college
i cant afford to lose my job
i told myself i was being honorable
beat but theres nothing honorable in what i did
beat maybe thats why they picked me for the job
maybe they knew what kind of man i was
rosalind is at the desk
anna brenda and jane are helping themselves to coffee
erin enters with a big box in her arms and a whole lot of attitude
hey ros where are they
in the conference but erins spotted them and headed off before rosalind can finish
anna brenda and jane notice the purpose in her gait
they watch her with interest
the table is covered with boxes of documents the anticipated slew of paper that pg e is sending them
ed kurt theresa andrew and about five paralegals are sifting through them
erin breezes in like sunshine
what are you ignoring ed you know what mr
i completely forgot your birthday this year
and seeing as how youve been so good to me i think that is a terrible oversight
so what i been doing over the last few days is ive been putting together a present for you
she plunks the box down on the table
potter opens the top of the box
they all signed
every single one
in the doorway anna brenda and jane appear wondering whats up
a huge smile of appreciation slowly spreads across eds face
ho ly shit
oh now dont get all jealous ed
i got a little something for you too
erin hands ed a manila envelope
he opens it
internal pg e documents all about the contamination
the one i like best says and im paraphrasing here but it says yes the waters poisonous but itd be better for all involved if this matter wasnt discussed with
its to the hinkley station from pg e headquarters
stamped received march
potter and theresa reel
ed shakes his head in disbelief
where did how did you do this
well what with me not having any brains or legal expertise i just went on up there and performed sexual favors
blow jobs in five days
whew am i ever tired
and she struts out of the room leaving everyone slack jawed
the clip clip clip of her heels carry her away
erin comes out of the office flushed with success and heads down the hall
she presses the elevator button
the doors open
as she steps on ed comes out of the office
erin puts her hand in the door keeping it from closing
he stares at her in awe
i dont know what to say
say you were wrong
i was wrong
say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself
say youd be the luckiest son of a bitch on earth if i didnt up and quit over all this
the luckiest son of a bitch in the universe erin
the luckiest son of a bitch in history
he looks down the hall at her standing so tall and proud in the elevator
he walks toward her stops right outside the elevator
but i know youre not gonna quit on me
how do you know that
with a smile cause you got a little voice in your head saying do the right thing
give him another chance
of course she will
she releases her hand so he wont see her smiling
ed watches the doors close
one of those days when the bay sparkles like a glitter ball
erins chevy moves up the pch
disco music emanates from it
erins at the wheel
time has passed her hairs a little different
shes singing along with funky town
erin gets out of her new truck looks sees the irvings in a little cluster
donnas under an umbrella
pete is slathering on sunscreen
the two girls zip out toward the water
pete and donna spot her wave back
donna is standing at the edge of the water watching her girls boogie board in
erin comes up behind her
how you feeling today
donna turns sees her
its a good day
i feel good
well then if youre feeling up to it maybe we should talk shop
erin sits down on a rock
the judge came up with a number
a number for the whole group or for us
donna sits down next to her
hes making them pay the maximum
tears of vindication spring to donnas eyes
oh my god
and hes making them give five million of it to you all
five million dollars
five million dollars
after a breathless beat i dont even know how much money that is
its enough for whatever you need for whatever your girls need for whatever your girls girls need itll be enough
donna wipes the tears off her face then watches the light flickering off her girls playing in the surf
i can put them in a good school
any school you want
and get someone to help around the house
oh my god
oh my god
donna is overwhelmed
erin pulls her close
oh my god
now this is where the hot lawyers work
a gleaming testament to power
they just moved in
everyone is unpacking at his or her desk
rosalind is manning the new phones
masry vititoe can i shoot
she lost them
her reaction indicates this isnt the first time
the front doors open and erin enters
nice view huh
yeah im gonna start sleeping here
into phone masry vititoe can i damn it
calling out does anyone know anything about these phones
erin heads on down a hall to a beautiful corner office
ed is unpacking when erin enters
careful you dont spit from here you could kill someone
you see your office
yours is nicer
here it comes
here what comes
the extortion the threats
i wasnt gonna i can always find someplace else to work
someplace thatll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the french riviera
ed i swear im not okay fine
fine you backed me into a corner again
youre holding me hostage
he reaches into his breast pocket pulls out a check
hands it to her
what is that
looks at it
her eyes bug out
two million dollars
the firm took in sixty
thats three percent
seemed like a fair bonus to me
she stares at it speechless
he goes back to unpacking oh now i suppose youre gonna say its not enough
well tough erin
too goddamn bad
cause this is absolutely positively where i draw the line
