written by john collee note our story alternates between past and present present means the fall of when darwin was
the children are etty george betty franky lenny and horace
past means the summer of when darwin was
the children are willy annie etty george betty franky y and baby lenny
in darkness chemicals wash over a copper plate
strange silvery patterns evolve in the half light
our pov rotates downwards onto an irregular shape
this shape is grey green and crammed with detail which emerges as we draw close like a continent seen from outer space
a fruit fly lands on it and we now recognise the shape as a patch of lichen
a number of other fruit flies are grazing there
the lichen is on a rock
a black lizard climbs over the horizon stalking flies
a slow advance
a sudden rush
a fly is snapped up and mashed between toothless gums
the lizard is fixing its beady gaze on the next potential victim when
a shadow falls the lizard tries to flee
a seabird grabs the lizard in its claws
death is sudden and bloody
the bird settles to eat
a sharpened stick flies out of nowhere and impales the bird through its wing
the wounded bird falls between boulders flapping helplessly
the rest of the flock take to their air calling and wheeling as
a crowd of local savages come racing over the larger horizon of the rocks armed with primitive bows and arrows spears rocks and throwing sticks
a child grabs the injured bird and kills it
an adult biffs the child on the head and steals the bird
the rest of the savages leap among the jagged rocks smiting each other shouting and snarling among the whirling flock of birds
a pov shot through a telescope the whirling birds the strange half animal forms of the savages
the whole scene is jerky out of focus and inaudible at this great distance like a very old silent movie
in terra del fuego
the land of fire a blighted and loveless country on the earths furthest rim there lives a community of the dirtiest the rudest the least civilised beings you can imagine
the telescope focusses
the image becomes a little clearer the flock of boobies fly out to sea
the savages follow as far as the top of the cliffs where they stop in sudden amazement staring at a distant sailing ship
they were all completely naked the men as well as the women with hair down to their bottoms
they spoke in grunts and they never washed their hands and faces
in many respects they resembled wild animals except that animals are kinder to their children
a savage child makes a comment and gets biffed on the head again
strange foreign cries of the sailors are faintly audible over the water as the anchor is dropped with a rattle and a splash
a small boat is lowered
one day captain fitzroy went ashore to meet them
the slow rhythm of the oars
sailors and savages clutch their weapons watching each other in breathless anticipation
a door opens and a figure in black hurries past clutching a number of prepared photographic plates in their light proof cases
not long now
i shall be with you immediately
annie darwin wearing in a checkered dress aged about years old sits looking straight at camera
she has short hair and a pretty oval face on her lap there is a posy of artificial flowers in the background an improbable vista of jagged mountain
very still please
will this hurt papa
it is only a beam of light
how can light make a picture
well they prepare a copper plate with chemicals on it
the chemicals are sort of energized by the light reflecting off your face
then silver sticks onto the plate according to where the light is brightest
betty was worried it would hurt
what a little duck she is
so as i was saying captain fitzroy went ashore to interview the fuegans
waves lap on the black pebbly beach where a young naval captain fitzroy with mutton chop sideboards disembarks lightly from his jolly boat
after some discussion persuaded three of the savages children to come home with him
the discussion is more in the nature of heated bargaining for slaves
fitzroy finally produces enough cloth and axe heads to secure the deal
the unwilling children pushed away by their parents and grabbed by sailors who bundle them biting crying and kicking into the waiting boat
their names were jemmy buttons york minster and fuegia basket
below decks a slapstick struggle with soap and scrubbing brushes much biting kicking and howling as sailors scrub the children clean
hold still ye maggot
the captain had them washed and got their hair cut then dressed them in proper clothes and taught them proper table manners
the children cleaned and dressed seem happy enough in their new situation
they sit at the captains table clumsily sawing with a knife and chasing brussel sprouts around a plate with their cutlery
a sprout shoots off the table splosh
a weighted canvas body bag is tipped overboard
the rough unshaven seamen crew all remove their hats some of them cry openly
york minster died of the smallpox but the other two learned english and went to meet the queen
a fanfare as the gates swing open as a coach and four rattles through
jemmy buttons looking very smart in velvet suit with silver buttons gives proper bow and shakes the royal hand
fuegia basket curtsies
queen victoria remains out of shot but her attendants hand out presents off a purple silk cushion a bible for fuegia and a telescope for jemmy hairy savages reassemble on
the cliff tops two years later
captain fitzroy and i took them back in the company of a young parson hoping they would bring the other savages to god and to teach the others by example
the hairy savages squint from the cliffs to sea
another boat the beagle has anchored in their bay
captain fitzroy is being rowed ashore with darwin plus a very young parson and the two young fuegans who are happy and agitated to see their homeland again
and what do you think happened
annie suspects there is a joke coming and cant help her mouth from twitching the corners
a complete and total failure
at the first sight of their countrymen jemmy and fuegia rip off their clothes drop the bible and the telescope and run to join them yelling like nut cases
the benighted young parson scrambles after them collecting their discarded garments from among the rain swept rocks
fuegia the telescope is smashed
the bible lies abandoned the wind catching its soggy pages and whirling them off in the storm
darwin still laughing dabs his eyes laughing yaaah
the photographer disappears behind black curtains
very still now
no more talking please annie composes her face in an expression of angelic seriousness
a glass dome above her head glows snapdragon blue close on darwin watching his daughter his eyes still damp with tears of laughter
the strange blue light glows brighter brighter
the image of his daughter imprints on darwins memory
servants are laying a table for dinner gas lamps and the coal fire struggle to illuminate the lofty room
mrs davies the welsh cook bangs the dinner gong and shouts across the darkening garden outside
darwins attractive wife emma adjusts the lamps and the boys run in franky aged lenny aged horace aged
what is it horace says hes six feet tall
have you all washed your hands
he said i have to be or i cant join the army
first things first
an officer must always tuck his shirt in
their elder sisters betty and etty take their places at table the boys made a camp with a camp fire oh
wheres the campfire
in the summer house but brodie put it out
parslow enters with the turreen thank you parslow
where is mr darwin
he was killing pigeons maam will everybody sit down please
as they are pulling in their chairs darwin enters drying his hands on his trousers
hes aged ten years since we last saw him and has lost his former air of gaiety
he sits with a distracted nod to the family
soup du jour sir the children smile at parslows air of earnest formality but the atmosphere even among the younger kids is sombre and subdued
thank you parslow he butters some bread and starts eating
emma clears her throat
the children bow their heads
the bread stick in darwins mouth
emma says grace
lord god who watches over all that we do
bless this family and the food we eat
in jesus name
everyone repeats the amen except darwin
i hear mr hooker is coming tomorrow
the children prick up their ears at this
they like hooker he wont stay long
did he say what it was about
i think this is not the time to discuss it
maybe the time to discuss it was before you invited him
he sent a telegram
im sorry if it inconveniences you
emma purses her lips and turns her attention back to the children eat your soup now
darwin takes a couple of spoonfuls pauses as a wave of nausea sweeps over him then pushes away the dish
to parslow tell mr davies it was delicious but my stomach is not quite right yet
to emma excuse me
he gets up and leaves
as soon as he has gone the children natural talkativeness reasserts itself
can we take mr hooker to the chalk pits
why cant he stay
can we pick blackberries
i think he is just here to work a branch taps gently against the window pain like an insistent guest demanding to be admitted
the coal fire burns low in the grate wind in the chimney rattling the damper firelight flickers on a collection of finches in a glass case on a bird skeleton
on a fossil and on numerous specimen bottles containing the fleshy parts of barnacles preserved in spirit of wine
darwin sits immobile in his chair regarding a locked black lacquered steel trunk on the floor under his work table
a voice speaks behind him
arent you going to open it
he turns and sees her sitting on the day bed the same little bright eyed girl from the daguerrotype studio
shes the same age as she was then and wearing the same checkered dress though darwin himself has aged ten years
maybe best if i just burn the whole lot
horrified no papa you cant
im in it
dont be absurd
of course youre not
the story of me when i was small
you showed me the pages
the natural history of babies remember
of course i remember
he continues to stare at the shiny black box his hand fluttering lightly a nervous tic
music seeps in a soothing chopin nocturne and
darwin aged bright eyed and inquisitive leans over to examine something offering it his finger tip while making little tut tut tut noises
in the cot is a one month old baby
the piano music continuing over as her fist closes round the end of his finger then tries to pull it towards her mouth
he pulls it away from her and she frowns
he offers it again and the tug of war becomes a game
baby annie laughs
darwin writes something in his notebook
then tucks his pencil behind his ear and tries out various facial expressions scowling smiling to gauge the babys response
emma turns on the piano stool
affectionately what are you doing
she comes over and leaning against him reads from his notebook
six weeks gurgles
holds tight to my finger
tries to suck
smiles at my smile the baby lets out a long yodel of pleasure i should add that she is musical
i hope you do not plan to treat all our children as little animacules to be included in your experiments
do you mean there will be more
i assumed thats what you wanted
of course if the idea doesnt appeal then
i am making plans for an army
he takes emma in his arms
she gives a little squeak caught off balance then laughing as he waltzes her around the room singing
an army of children the darwin family run across the screen from left to right
the little kids first scampering through the hay meadow off into the trees
household servants follow carrying blankets hampers and parasols
the red haired scottish nursemaid brodie shouts ahead to the little ones
not too far ahead now
the children ignore her so she pick up her skirts and races after them
the adults follow in their wake charles and emma darwin plus two younger men aged about joe hooker and the rev innes they have set up their picnic on a
emma is reading
joseph hooker is teaching the boys to fish
he has spectacles and long wispy side whiskers a battered panama on his head and his trousers rolled up to his knees
give it time to take a bite
the fishing float moves a little hes nibbling
no one move
hes dropped his spectacles in the shallows
george aged feels a jerk on the line
he squeals and drops the rod
the fish takes off upriver
will goes after the dropped rod
on shore annie runs up with a collecting box to show her father ive got one
she opens the box to show him a little black beetle
the local parson innes inclines his head to inspect it what should i feed it
a leaf i should think
what plant did you find him on
in the mud under that log
innes looks to darwin for advice or a piece of bark maybe
darwin peers at the insect cycrus caraboides
you can see from the mandibles hes a hunter
he feeds on slugs and snails
annie runs off calling to the other children etty
find me some slugs
when i said i knew something of insects
i studied theology for a year but yet i know exceedingly little of the bible
then once i am properly installed at down i shall take pleasure in instructing you
i should look forward to that immensely
emma knowing her husbands ambivalence towards religion casts him a slightly arch amused look
innes notices this though he pretends not to
hooker returns from the river looking slightly damp with the rod which he has managed to retrieve everyones a bit wet
sorry but the fish are surely biting
more worms boys more worms
george is looking under stones try over there georgey weve used all these ones up
they move off joining annie and the other in their hunt for crawling things
the air above them is heavy and sparkling with pollen
a sailing ship sails past trailing phosphorescence it its wake
on the beagle quite often we would drop a flask in the ocean and find it teeming with living particles which glowed in the night the figure in silhouette of
young darwin inspects a flask of sea water glowing in the darkness
he takes a few drops on a watch glass and places them on the illuminated stage of his microscope
under the microscope against a black background millions of tiny swimming animals
cut to the air above the picnickers alive with glittering particles against the dark trees behind
so much beauty for so little purpose
surely not without purpose
they were helping to light the ships way were they not
darwin smiles at the idea turns to innes are you familiar with the works of thomas malthus mr innes
he married his first cousin didnt he
so did charles
so did i
oh i was not at all suggesting
emma waves it away
just teasing he made the point that if every trout say has a hundred offspring and so on and so on through the generations
then the planet would be knee deep in trout in just a few decades
of course most of the eggs are destroyed and eaten so the numbers remain stable
that is the beauty of gods plan
emma gives darwin a so there look and hands innes a sandwich
cheese and cucumber thank you somewhere in the woods annie has found a treasure trove of worms and slugs
there are millions
it doesnt strike you as an exceedingly wasteful plan these myriad lives created only to be immediately extinguished
a gentle warning charles
confidently they are providing food for others
you think they are happy about it
close up on a writing worm
hooker is instructing george how to put a worm on a hook
through his bottom and up though his mouth perfect to be doing gods will
to innes please ignore him
after two glasses of claret he tends to becomes mischievous
no im serious
if thousands are destroyed that a few may live their lives is not the general sum total of happiness not in some kind of massive deficit
well far be it from me to speculate on the mind of god far less the happiness of an earthworm ha ha ha
but it seems to me that nature is at peace
and most of her denizens are content
to darwin you dont agree
i think it is a battlefield
a constant and shifting struggle for survival between everything and everything else
i really do think men have a problem with natural beauty
they cannot ever just accept it for what it is
calls off children
then tell me of your wife mr innes
darwin lies back on the rug and turns his head away from the sun
the base of a tangled hedgerow is just a few feet away
looking into its tangled depths he sees something gleaming white the skull of a sheep with briars growing through the eye sockets
the sheeps skull is half decomposed
in fast forward we see maggots pecking the remnants of flesh from the bone birds feeding on the maggots
a bird becomes trapped among the briars
it flaps madly upsetting a nest
eggs and blind featherless hatchlings fall down through the dark web of branches where they are devoured by voles and rats then slugs then worms all the times tendrils and
vines are growing the skull bleached white now encased in a cage of thick spiny branches fizzing with insect life where ants and ground beetles feast on the carcasses of slugs and
darwin wakes in sudden terror
dawn light illuminates the wallpaper in front of him a william morris design of interweaving vines
emma is asleep in her night cap at his side
darwin lies for a while in the semi darkness until his hand fluttering on the coverlet becomes still at last
light and noise
crash of gleaming copperware clattering of water in the pipes as the servants prepare sunday breakfast the cook mrs davies looks out through a steamed up window to see the
angular figure of charles darwin bent almost double inspecting a tiny segment of lawn
brodie joins mrs davies at the window
what is he doing now exactly
cutting the grass with nail scissors
such a shame he never had a proper job
at least your mr thackeray had his books to write
children thunder up and down the stairs between brodie who is doing a final check on grooming and emma who is marshalling them in the hall
chop chop georgie
and you have not buttoned your trousers
baby lenny starts crying and she goes to comfort him brodie is arranging hair and tying ribbons for annie etty and betty did you never think of getting married miss
but he went to australia and i missed my chance
willy passes the door his hair in need of brushing
william comes in
brodie brushes the back of his hair
well what do you expect
it is a birds nest
papa says god doesnt care if we are neat
brushing your father is a very wize man but has a small understanding of religion
no one can read what goes down in gods great book of accounts
willy presents them for checking
you can go
the children come racing and swinging and clattering down the stairs
emma holding the baby in one arm steers a tricycle out of the way clearing a path to the door mrs davies will you ask jenny to wear a bonnet
i would not like people to think her fast
george aged tugs at her skirt can i bring my mouse for a blessing
george pulls it out from his pocket
its dead muddy and bloody elsie caught it in the barn
we need to pray for his soul mice dont have souls
leave it on the window sill
everyone come now or we shall be late
pealing of church bells mist rises from the ploughed fields and hangs among the ancient oaks
a little procession heads down the lane
the darwins charles and emma plus their servants and children older now for we have flipped into the present all in their sunday best
the trees are bare
their breath condenses as they walk
the ancient flint church stands in the centre of downe sic village opposite the george and dragon pub
a massive and venerable yew tree casts its shade over a number of gravestones one of them inscribed to mary darwin born sept died oct
beyond the church fence villagers greet each other before heading inside
the great majority of the village have turned out from squire lubbock through the tradesmen and domestic servants from the village to the clodhoppers farm labourers in their colored smocks
rev innes is welcoming his large flock at the gate
welcome then his eye moves on to charles darwin and his smile falters his expression turning slightly cold
darwin tips his hat rather stiffly and walks away through the throng of parishioners leaving his family to file into the church without him
darwin walks across the meadow and into the woods
a flock of crows take flight from the rookery in the bare trees overhead
in darkness a furious struggle squawking and frantically beating wings
darwin seizes on a dove and backs out of the dovecote the silhouette of his upper torso taking shape in the square hole in the floor
he climbs down the ladder passes the captive bird down to parslow then climbs back up and pushes him upper body into the dovecot again in search of the next
the dovecote is a substantial affair on four pillars with a ladder in the centre
outside the dovecote the boys are racing around playing at soldiers
franky lenny horace parslow has a number of the birds in cages ring the two milky pouters
well sacrifice the tumblers and skeletonize them
he looks up as a coach appears in the lane
the boys immediately break off from their game and run after it shouting
its mr hooker
its mr hooker
darwin tries to wipe the bird shit off his hands and succeeds only in getting it on his sleeve
his breathing quickens
he seems at a loss
parslow is awaiting further instructions then
to the shed with them
i shall clean myself up
he hurries off
the coach pulls up and hooker alights ten years older than when we saw him catching fish but still with the same hallmark side whiskers and wire rimmed spectacles the
same springy step and ready grin
already he is being mobbed by the younger boys lenny franky and horace who clearly adore him
were the light brigade horace is a russian
good choice horace
i shall be lord raglan and watch the slaughter from a safe distance
will you give us a piggy back
lenny cut his foot on a nail
there was lots of blood
emma emerges from the front door
she smiles pleased to see hooker despite her misgivings
then her smile falters as another man emerges from the coach behind him
forgive the short notice
you know thomas huxley
only by reputation mrs darwin
he insisted on coming and i could not refuse him
tell papa his visitors are here
he knows already
he went that way
emma smiles brightly covering for her embarrassment at her husbands increasingly erratic behavior
come in please
hooker heads towards the house the boy still clustered around him
sir is it true when you were in the himalayas you were imprisoned by the king of sikkim
and he thought you were a spy for stealing his rhododendrons
thats approximately true
and he wouldnt let you leave unless you agreed to marry his fattest daughter
but you are never to tell my wife that
children leave mr hooker alone now
im sure he has more important things to discuss
not really but i think mr huxley does
huxley has seen darwin washing his hands by the skeletonizing shed
huxley hangs back to introduce himself as hooker steers emma off into the house
i have my heart set on a cup of tea and one of mrs davies scones
emma looks anxiously after huxley but allows herself to be gently side lined
emma is by the kitchen window rearranging tea things on a tray
the sky outside is dark and lowering
through the window she can see darwin heading off down the sand walk head bowed walking stick in hand deep in conversation with huxley
she drops a tea cup which smashes on the stone floor
ill do that maam
let me do it
the sand walk is a gravel walking path between the garden and the fields flanked by mature oaks and ancient willows
were reforming the linnean
the committee will comprise myself lyell huxley
yourself of course if you are willing
darwin grunts noncommittally
the crunch crunch of their feet is punctuated by the regular stomp of his metal shod walking stick
we intend to reclaim science as a profession wrest it away from the country parsons and beetle collectors
your book will be our rallying point
you know it is not yet any fit state to publish
i have read your detailed abstract
the argument is complete and utterly compelling
all that is lacking is the detail and we know you have that in abundance
your barnacle work has established you as the pre eminent authority on marine life
on one small mollusc
in which the whole story of creation can be read
do not pretend to me that was not your intention
a family tree of barnacles stretching back million years to the time it was a free swimming prawn
there are many gaps
of course with gaps
but that is the very point
if we but had the complete fossil record we could trace all life back to one speck of protoplasm
the branching of forms in ever more complex succession
yes yes but one cannot infer too much
either you are being disingenuous or you do not fully understand you own accomplishment
you have killed god
mr huxley and good riddance to the bearded malicious old bugger
interrupts please i must beg of you
i must beg of you sir
joseph hooker we know is too nice a chap to do it
you are a fine and brilliant man who hates to give offence an admirable quality wish i had it myself
but what do we believe
what do we know to be true
will you light the way or leave us all to flounder in the mire for another decade
he stops and lowers himself onto a bench teeth clenched
are you alright
a touch of indigestion
it will pass
its clearly worse than that but huxley refusing to be distracted blithely ignores it and sits down beside him til the worst of it passes
it is time to write your book mr darwin
write it brilliantly as we all know you can
strike hard and fast with a blow that is utterly conclusive
in pain sir you are talking like a revolutionary and really
it is a revolution
and not before time
huxley contd goodbye to the lot of em damned bishops and archbishops with their threats of eternal punishment
and youd replace gods laws with what
the laws of logic
the laws of nature
knowing as we do that most capital crimes are her everyday practises theft rape murder adultery infanticide
huxley waves it away we live in a society bound together by the church
an improbable sort of barque i grant you but at least it floats
you suggest we change all that at a stroke
you wish me to rebuild plank by plank the very vessel we are sailing in
the coach to london has pulled up outside the front gate
huxley is aboard
darwin is talking with the coachman hooker comes down the path in his black coat carrying his gladstone bag
he has already said his good byes
i beg you please dont push him
no one can push charles
you know how fixed he is
bit of a barnacle himself
his own words
and if you prize him from his rock he will die
i know you all mean well but
impatiently all aboard
hooker gets aboard
huxley leans out of a window and waves cheerily to the whey faced darwin well meet again mr darwin the coach pulls away
looking back though the rear window hooker sees emma with the boys clustered around her skirts
what did she say to you
that it was killing him
a mighty slow death considering the time hes spent
well be dead and buried ourselves if he prevaricates much longer
huxley takes off his spectacles and polishes them embarrassed by huxleys directness inspecting his own conscience in the bevelled glass
in the darkened study with his specimens and books all around him darwin kneels by the box
steeling himself he unlocks the padlock and opens the lid and takes out the papers and notebooks which are stored there
the bulk of it is a single manuscript accumulated over many years divided into chapters with pages of notes interleaved
the chapters are headed
variation under domestication variation under nature struggle for existence natural selection
a noise behind him almost makes him jump out of his skin
its annie ten years old in her checked dress as she will always be in his imagination
why are you scared
like you said
youre in it
its only a book silly
he sits there regarding the open box paralysed by indecision
annie tenderly smooths his hair rearranging his collar
what are you doing annie
im making you beautiful
i have to work
though the soft touch of her little hands is almost too real for him to bear and he closes his eyes breath in papa
now tell me a story
i have no time
the sound of a wave breaking
wind stirs darwins hair he opens his eyes and he is
sitting with annie ten years ago on an english pebble beach
she has collected a pile of shells and is arranging them in families
the dialogue is continuous why do you always ask for jenny
its so sad
thats why i like it
it makes me cry
she looks up from her shells and smiles winningly
darwin looks out to sea at the bright crashing line of surf and begins the familiar much told tale once apon a time there was a family of orang u
tangs living in the jungles of darkest borneo our pov moves between dark tropical trees to find a group of orangutans flopping around grooming each other
as with the land of the fuegan savages there is something slightly artificial about these jungles as though the trees really belong in kew gardens and the naked jungle warriors
whom we now see stalking through them are on loan from the museum of mankind
their eldest daughter was the most loving caring and trusting orang of all
we follow a young nimble female swinging through the trees revelling in her own gymnastic ability until she stops hearing something the sound of human speech
but these qualities in themselves cannot guarantee an apes survival
sometimes quite the reverse
native hunters are creeping through the undergrowth a warning screech from one of the orang u tangs posted as lookouts
most of the apes flee up into the canopy
jenny stays where she is fascinated just a moment longer than is prudent
when she realized her danger it was too late
as she turns to flee a weighted net is thrown on top of her
the hunters pounce
they put her in a bag and carried her off
much to her loving parents sorrow
the family screech and hoot anguished as the hunters head back off through the trees
exotic coins and bank notes pass from hand to hand from the tribal chief to the sultan in his overlarge turban from the sultan to the trader in his solar
topee and stained white suit
the hunters sold her the to the sultan who promptly sold her to a visiting englishman who packed her aboard a sailing ship and brought her to london zoo
jenny is taken out of a bamboo cage and put into a metal cage
the cage is lowered by a crane
jenny looks out from her swaying prison at spinning grey skies and brick warehouses
now she sits disconsolately in a corner of her permanent enclosure
she has been dressed ridiculously and poignantly in a smock and a bonnet
a group of onlookers are trying to get a reaction out of her
eventually they give up and move on
in london she had many admirers of whom your father was but one
darwin moves forwards from the shadows where he has been observing and taking notes
as the other humans move away be attempts to start a conversation with jenny in her own language much in the way he communicated with baby annie
hoo hoo hoo hoo
jenny regards him sceptically then looks away
she startles and looks at him aggressively
he reaches in his pocket
this gets her interest
she comes closer expecting food
darwin takers out a sprig of verbena a strongly scented herb
he holds in front of his nose and inhales making contented expressions of pleasure
darwin holds the verbena towards jenny
cautiously she extends a hand through the bars
their fingers touch in space like god giving life to adam
for darwin its a breakthrough a moment of connection
jenny eats the verbena and spits it out shrieking angrily
wait sorry wait ive got something else here for you he reaches in his pocket
she cocks her head alert
with the air of a conjurer he pulls out a childs hand mirror flashing as it catches the sun through the skylights
pleasurable surprise ahhhh
he shows jenny her own reflection and then hands the mirror through the bars
jenny takes the mirror bites it discovers it is inedible and smashes it on the ground
charles makes a sad whining sound hew hew hew
meaning ok then im sorry
its such a complex human reaction grudging contrition that charles laughs aloud with pleasure
charles takes out a mouth organ and plays a snatch of chopin
jenny covers her ears and chatters
not listening not listening
charles insulted stops playing
jenny laughs waves a hand as if to say play if it amuses you
im must kidding
the salt wind
the dazzling light
the slow pulse of the surf
darwin has paused in his narrative
go on papa
go on what
the bit where she gets sick and dies
why do you want to hear that bit
i just like it
it makes me cry
darwin smiles his own eyes filling with tears
then a door opens softly in the sky
it opens wider to reveal emmas elegant profile framed against the gaslight of the hallway
her pov the black box is unlocked and open its contents strewn around the floor at darwins feet
darwin is sitting on the floor of the study holding in his had a magazine published by the society for the useful distribution of knowledge with a picture of jenny
on the cover are you coming to bed
he doesnt move
she comes in what did huxley want
he thinks i should write it and be done with it
he feels it is a question of moral courage
or the lack of it
you did not tell him about your health
his theory is that i am making myself ill by holding back
that i should lance the boil
plunge in and hang the consequences
thank the lord he is not a surgeon
darwin takes a breath and plunges in himself ive concluded he is right
bite the gag
speed is everything
it will all be over in a matter of months
emma is horrified
it is not mere months that concern me charles
nor even years or decades
its said quietly but with genuine anguish
to emma it is as though her life partner has announced hes contemplating suicide
do you really care so little for your immortal soul for the knowledge that you and i may never be together in all of eternity
softly you know that what concerns you concerns me also
what do think has held me in limbo all these years
they both know it
she turns abruptly from the door and hurries away
emma has been crying
she lies in bed pretending to sleep
darwin gets into bed behind her
he wants desperately to reach out a hand to touch her to comfort her but he cannot do it for fear of weakening his own fragile resolve
you know this is not a decision made lightly
in the dawn light darwin is writing a letter to his wife
it has been a very slow and gradual process like the raising of continents
emma stands alone in the wintry garden a white apron over her black dress reading
what else can i say to you except that it seems the process is now complete
a tear tracks down the curve of emmas cheek as she folds the letter puts it in her pocket and return to the business of dead heading flowers
in voice over we hear singing
all things bright and beautiful all creatures great and small
all things wize and wonderful the lord god made them all
move in through the graveyard past the ancient yew
each little flower that opens each little bird that sings he made their glowing colors he made their tiny wings
the church is packed for the sunday morning service the darwin family stand in the front row
emma the servants and the rest of the family are singing lustily parslow a somewhat pompous operatic tenor brodie and innes both loudly scottish innes out of tune annie by
darwins side trilling along in a tuneful little descant
she notices her father is not singing and offers him her hymn book with the words
darwin smiles and returns it
its not that he doesnt know the lyrics its just that he cant bring himself to say them
all things bright and beautiful all creatures great and small
all things wize and wonderful the lord god made them all
the organ played by mrs innes wheezes to a pause
innes himself mounts the pulpit
let us pray
everyone bows their heads in prayer
lord god we know the world is governed by thy plan
darwin is immediately not listening
he looks along the row of his children standing dutifully in a line between charles and emma
george aged is studying the woodlice which are nesting between the pages of his hymnal extending even to the merest creatures thou hast made such that even a sparrow falls
not to the ground without thy will
darwin stands watching the play of light from the stained glass window on his shoes
then raises his head teach us that all misfortune
all sickness and death all the trials and miseries of which we daily complain are intended for our good being not the vagaries of an uncaring universe but the corrections
of a wize and affectionate parent innes looks up sternly and sees the darwins head raised among the sea of down turned heads
their eyes meet briefly in a sort of challenge and in that moment darwin somehow knows with absolutely certainty that religious faith has left him
with a whispered word to the beadle standing next to him to take the collection darwin slips out from the pew and heads off up the aisle
excuse me hes intending to be quiet and subtle but the creaking boards under his feet loudly announce his departure
innes raises his voice above the fusillade
turn with me now to the book of job chapter two verse twelve the congregation not daring to raise their heads watch darwins sturdy walking shoes departing down the aisle
the rise and fall of inness voice continues in the background as darwin walks out from the porch emerging from shadow into sunlight
a summers day
he feels like a weight has been lifted
the church beadle comes out behind him
are you all right sir
he heads off up the gravel path the faint and distant sound of church singing filters through the misty woods
the black wet trunks of trees catch the sunlight
frosty dew highlights mistletoe and holly and dead bracken and the sudden red flash of a robin
darwin cuts a strange dark angular figure walking along the narrow track a single step at a time
he pauses breathing and listens
his quick eye catches the robin seizing a worm
a pheasant breaks cover
a hare stands upright in a clearing then bounds away
darwin looks down and takes another step placing his feet carefully silently so as not to disturb the wildlife
cut to a different pair of much newer shoes in exactly the same spot
darwin is ten years younger pacing in the same measured way through summer woodland
theres a noise behind him and he turns finger to his lips for silence
annie turns away from him and passes the sign down the line of children etty george betty and franky in decreasing order of height
shh to annie what are we looking at
the question comes back up the line a weasel
the children bunch up to gaze on a strange and wonderful sight
in a little sun dappled clearing a weasel is turning loop the loops in a strange spiralling dance for the benefit of
a young rabbit which sits utterly hypnotized by the performance
at first its strange and amusing then the dance becomes more sinister
the weasel advancing by tiny increments as it tumbles in the air finally the weasel seizes the bunny rabbit by the back of the neck and shakes it savagely
the rabbit shrieks and spasms
annie is beside herself drumming the ground with her feet in a fever of fear and pity
the rabbit is still in its dearth throes its neck broken its back legs still jerking no
make it stop
the rabbit is already dead
annie annie annie
he sinks to his knees heedless of the mud on his sunday best worsted embracing her
the others are shocked and amazed by the rabbits death but none of them distressed as annie
they are country children and death is an everyday event the chickens do that too when cookie kills them tearful furious chickens are different
to her father annie contd why didnt you do something
you should have stopped it
the weasel has to eat
its the way of the world
annie its not fair
its not fair
no its not fair at all
patting her and stroking her as the little sobs subside
the weasel is dragging the dead rabbit back to its lair
but still it is extraordinary do you not think that a weasel should learn to dance the polka
despite herself the concept amuses annie
chest still heaving with sobs she dries her eyes and smiles at him through her tears
piano music chopin plays softly over as charles and emma do the rounds of their large brood of children turning out lamps and kissing sleeping heads taking a doll from
one sleeping childs embrace a sword from another
shooing a cat and her kittens from the bedroom
good night lenny
good night frankie good night betty
darwin watches his wife a sensuous figure stooped over the sleeping child a lock of hair falling forwards as she kisses her
good night george good night etty
good night willy good night annie shes sound asleep
finally charles and emma are alone together in the blissfully silent house
emma smiles dear charles dearest emma he takes her hand and leads her to their bedroom
emma lies on a rug her head is in darwins lap
she is reading aloud from a new book of poems by wordsworth
loving she is and tractable though wild
and innocence hath privilege in her
to dignify arch looks and laughing eyes and feats of cunning and the pretty round of trespasses affected to provoke mock chastisement and partnership in play she puts the book
down smiling then we were wrong
she is not unique after all
darwin is watching annie dancing in front of the surf turning cartwheels a wild dancing sprite of the sea oblivious to the cold shouting and singing later near the cliff
darwin is geologising hes excited breathless and windswept shouting over the sound of the nearby surf as he clambers over the huge assorted boulders pointing out the geological strata to his kids who are more interested in clambering
this is devonian about million years ago
rocks like this might have fishes in them trilobites tree ferns corals maybe
he knock off a corner of rock with his geological hammer then moves on is this a bit
no that is cretaceous etty
it was made a hundred millions years ago when this cliff was a coral reef and down village was a swamp full of great crocodiles
tap tap tap with his hammer as the boys scramble upwards playing at mountaineers
we might find oysters and sponges imprinted in it or dinosaurs if we were lucky
whats a dinosaur
professor owen invented them
they are the giant lizards which lived on earth before there were any humans
but they werent real of course they are betty
did i never tell you of the skeletons i found in south america to etty do you remember mr martell
annie arrives hopping nimbly over the rocks still in her wet swimsuit yes you do
when he came to tea and showed us drawings of his iguanodon
and george burnt his fingers roasting chestnuts
she doesnt remember
you should have your clothes on annie
you are quite blue
savages dont swear clothes
she runs to the top of a great fallen rock spreads her arms out and yells to the sky
im a fuegan
well dont fall and hurt yourself
your mother would never forgive me
annie gives a shout and disappears head over heels
ive found one
in the rubble at the base of the rocks she has landed unhurt and quite by accident on a perfect specimen of a fossilized trilobite
the black box lies open with all its secrets strewn around the office
stacks of paper a stack for every chapter are held down with paperweights a fossil a skull a specimen bottle
darwin squares a stack of blank paper between his hands then reaches for his pen
annie reaches for her pen
reverend innes is giving the children their writing lessons according to mulhausers technique first positions
the children assume the position as if in some militaristic drill
grips are adjusted pens are dipped
assume the distance
the children lean back fractionally so their elbows are just back from the edge of the desk
the children start to copy the sentence which innes has written on the blackboard
annie reads the sentence and hesitates and on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made and he rested darwin massages his cramped hand then takes a
blank sheet of notepaper
i am one week into the great project and i feel at last that it is real
its title is on the origin of species
as i write theses words why does it feel as though i am confessing to a murder
a paper stirs in the breeze and he pins it with the nearest object to hand annies trilobite
his eye rests on it a moment the corrugated gray surface greatly magnified
the darwin of ten years ago is examining the trilobite with a watchmakers eyeglass
there is a small mirror above his desk angled so as to give him a view of the path leading round from the front of the house
innes appears briefly in it preceded by annie who is trotting to keep pace with him and crying
darwin intent on his work notices neither of them from downstairs he hears the door knocker then brodies voice then emmas overlapping with half heard fragments of inness scottish brogue
i thought you needed to know why i had to chastised her
darwin remains immersed examining each detail of the trilobite comparing it with other specimens in books and in boxes
it is not fair to the other nor to annie herself that her head be filled with these ideas
are you listening annie
annie sobs louder incoherent in her grief
darwin finally focusses on the sounds recognizes her distress and gets up to investigate
he reaches the top of the stairs
annie is directly below him slumped still sobbing at the foot of the stairs
emma has ushered innes to the porch out of sight
i shall bid you good day then the front door closes
darwin comes downstairs what happened
its not nothing
to annie why are your knees bleeding
mr innes had to have words with her
it is sorted now
words are very well
i am asking what happened to her knees
mr innes sent me to the corner and made me kneel on rock salt
in a rush i said there were dinosaurs and he said there wasnt dinosaurs but there were because you saw them
let me talk to your father
he told her to kneel til she repented
the bleeding is due to her own stubborn ness
it is finished now
it is by no means finished
where is my coat
its intolerable charles
charles ignores her forcing his arm into the sleeve of his coat
mr innes is a dear friend and neighbor
i beg you at least appraise yourself the facts
she contradicted him repeatedly
the fault was annies mr innes was quite within his rights
his arm is stuck in his rights to torture our children for expressing the plain truth
brodie appears and darwin ushers annie towards her please take her to it is not the truth as he kitchen
sees it well damn how he sees it
damn the pair of them and all their works charles listen to yourself
listen blocking his path as he heads for the door
her palm flat on his lapel soothing reasoning with him emma please
i will not have innes tell me what i can and cannot tell my children
it is what i have told them every night at bedtime
it is the instruction my aunt and your brother and most of our family live by
it is what all of the village believe
or try to
must our children be revolutionaries at nine years of age
write to him with your concerns our concerns about the manner of the punishment but please do not set yourself against him
think of my feelings on this
i beg you
finally his outrage has spent itself neutralized by her gentle persistence and the deep affection he holds for her
youre right of course
he embraces her
emma is reassured she cannot see the conflict written all over darwins face
the conflicted expression has hardened the furrows in darwins brow etched deeper as he dips his pen and begins the second chapter
from the floor below we can hear emma practising a piece of music on the piano chopins revolutionary etude a rippling brooding arpeggio running up and down the keyboard redolent
of an angry sea
darwins pen scratches doggedly over the paper
in the bedroom in his nightgown darwin scrubs the ink stains off his fingers with a pumice stone
emma passes behind him preparing for bed
he glances at her in the mirror youre still angry with me
i can always tell by your playing
darwin sits at his desk writing and editing his hand clamped on the pen
a voice speaks from nowhere talk to her
still writing and say what
she does not want to hear it
then write to her
irritably that is what i am doing annie i am writing all of it
emma passing the open door glimpses darwin talking angrily to himself as he writes
and then she can read it and we can all be free of this
now please annie no more interruptions
the music continues louder
a frosty coating of dew covers the lawn
footprints lead to a strange wooden tower in the garden
parslow stands outside shivering in the grey morning light
darwin shouts from inside
parslow pulls a lever
theres the sound of crashing water a yell of pain from inside the tower
ravens rise calling from the surrounding trees
darwin dips his pen scores out some text from his previous draft and writes again
the music continues from downstairs louder and more insistent than before
emmas hands race back and forwards along the piano keyboard
darwins pen scratches across the pages making a noise like fingernails on a blackboard
the music from downstairs seeming to drive into his skull he speaks aloud the words he is writing in an effort to drown out the piano music
in time small variations become extreme
strange detailed drawings of barnacles are strewn across his desk seeming to change and transmute before his eyes
organs change their very function the oviduct becomes a cement gland
his hand is shaking too much to write
whats an oviduct
nothing that need concern you
sulkily i know what it is anyway
darwin gets up abruptly from his desk
darwin stands naked clutching to two hand rails for support as a great tub of freezing water tilts and pours its contents on top of him
darwin yells birds rush out from the dovecote darwin dips his pen and writes what was once a free swimming creature now finds itself glued by its head to a
rock flailing for food with its legs
the revolutionary etude is continuous now real or imagined
underwater among the swirling seaweed fragile sea creatures being torn this way and that by the raging surf annie screams and kicks her legs overwhelmed by water in some dark
pull back to reveal a vision of hell the water is fire
the barnacles are people
the people are annie emma and darwin
darwin wakes in a panic and sits up in bed
he raises his right arm and looks down at his inky writing hand fluttering in the moonlight like an organ with a will all of its own emma is a
theres a crucifix on the wall above her bed
on the bedside table theres a bible
about the midst of this valley i perceived the mouth of hell to be and it stood also hard by the wayside
now thought christian what shall i do
the children are gathered around emma who is reading a bed time story to them by lamplight
emma is in the centre of a circle of little attentive faces
shes aware of darwin standing in the darkened corridor beyond the door drawn to the cosy little group but unable to join it
she lets him be
continues reading and ever and anon the flame and smoke would come out in such abundance with sparks and hideous noises that he was forced to put up his sword
and betake himself to another weapon called all prayer
the older girls etty and betty finish their prayers and jump into bed in their night gowns emma comes in to take away their lamp
is daddy not coming to kiss us good night he is still a little bit ill from working
thats what you said last night
emma turns out the light
in the darkness etty says
i think when annie died he stopped loving us
emma returns to her bedside oh come now etty
you know thats not true
he is just a little bit ill and a little bit busy
in the bowels of down house the house we find darwin wrapped in wet towels sweating in front of the wood burning stove
as he gazes into the leaping flames annie appears at his shoulder
is there really such a place as hell
no of course not
how can there be
if he is supposed to be loving and forgiving what on earth is the sense punishing all these millions of souls
but just suppose if there was
and all this was punishment
i dont know what you mean
darwin stands legs apart in the water tower bracing himself like a colossus against the full force of the deluge
the gardener splitting logs watches darwin stagger from the tower with a rug wrapped around him and make his way back to the house
darwin lowers himself into bed inky and tousled
he seems prematurely aged crippled by the gruelling process of writing the book
as he lies there unable to sleep lines of written text seems to appear behind his closed eyes or in the tangled vines of the wallpaper
emma speaks from the other side of the bed
talk to mr innes
you are clearly not well he is what
a physician now you know what i mean
i think he can help you
charles remains stubbornly silent his hand fluttering over the coverlet
i am taking the children to maer for a while to visit their cousins
beat i worry for you charles
please talk to him fire flares in the grate as darwin compares the skeletons of various pigeons
he starts a new chapter changes under domestication pigeons mate and coo in the dusty twilight
parslow picks up two of them casually wrings their necks and heads off with them to the skeletonizing shed
darwin looks out of the study window searching for inspiration
he sees emma and the children getting into a coach with their baggage
darwin sits at his desk
he has written the chapter heading and nothing else
parslow knocks and looks in will you be eating sir
no thank you
darwin addresses the empty room
she will not come
annie dancing in the surf
one minute she is there and the next she has vanished lost among the churning waves
darwin leaps top his feet shouting annie
raucous male laughter takes us to the george and dragon on a saturday night
the air loud with laughter and thick with pipe smoke
clodhoppers crowd the snug many of them roaring drunk with their florid complexions stained and broken teeth
darwin trying to slip in discreetly is spied by a group of locals who hail him and gather around him wedging him into a corner with their overloud loud talk
i was explaining to mr goodman here your interest in breeding
mr darwin is our foremost scholar in the village
no i am but one of many
there is squire lubbock and the reverend innes the thatcher waves them away as lesser talents
he is also a noted explorer the author of many books
which no one has read
a fellow of the royal society and a prodigious expert on clams
mr goodman now is the foremost pigeon fancier in all the southern counties
kent champion two years running
i swear he can give you any beak or plumage in four generations
head and tail in five
how do you do it
by breeding cousin with cousin
i find it the fastest way to alter the strain provided you do not weaken it in other ways
darwin takes a slug of whiskey he is drinking in his office
the clock strikes twelve
the page in front of him remains stubbornly blank darwin is rising from his desk when he sees something move
in one of the bottles on his desk a fleshy marine specimen seems to have come to life
it writhes blindly in its bottle of formalin making a sound like a baby crying
darwin recoiling in horror pushes himself back from his desk
the castors on his chair trundle back from his desk
behind him he hears a tapping and turns to see that all the birds in his big glass display case of galapagos finches have started to beat against the inside
the crowded glass case
they flutter frenzied tapping with their beaks on the inside of the glass which shatters as
one by one the bottled specimens explode discharging their contents onto the floor
a lamp falls over
the room is filled with birds the floor awash with formalin and broken glass
the study seems to tilt like the cabin of a ship in a storm and
darwin wakes from the nightmare asleep at his desk the whiskey bottle a quarter empty ink on his hands and his shirt cuffs he gets up and puts on his
the scullery maid lighting the fire looks round and sees darwin
he walks past her without a word and heads out into the garden
darwin heads across the lawn takes a key from his belt and opens the door of the skeletonizing shed
in the grey light he takes in the corpses of doves from the dovecote
some have been skinned their pelts curing on frames their carcasses steeping in a buckets chemicals which remove the flesh from the bones
previously he regarded this place as a sort of laboratory
now it seems a place of horror
the door opens behind him
get rid of them
which ones sir
all of them
all of it
darwin reaches into the dovecote and starts grabbing pigeons at random dragging them out and flinging them into the air
displaced doves beat the air
darwin climbs down the ladder grabs and axe and attacks the wooden stanchions supporting the dovecote parslow comes running over from the skeletonizing shed calling sir
darwin stands back hair wild eyes crazed his sleeves covered in bird shit
please rest sir
ill have john lewis remove it
have some breakfast now and rest
shall i call the doctor
or the water tower
a pox on all of them
the local doctor henry holland takes out various concoctions from his medical bag and arranges them on the dresser
we are in the past
annie is in bed with a fever
emma is pregnant
calomel then twice daily
i will not give it to her
mrs darwin it is nothing but chloride of mercury
i have prescribed it often in children as young as two
not to any of mine i hope
on the beagle i dropped some on a microscope slide and all my animacules died of it
well animacules are not persons
presumably they would die if you dose them with madeira wine
on madeira they thrived most excellently as did captain fitzroy while it lasted
annie enjoys the joke and gives darwin a weak smile
the doctor regards her balefully or if she would submit to be bled
i will write to dr gully again
sceptical the hydro therapist
i have always found his treatments most effective
no matter that they defy all sense of logic
he is packing up his bottles and his lancets logic is not everything
emma shoots him a look
til now scientific logic has been his guiding principle
then i shall bid you good day
parslow will bring your carriage
i will be down presently the doctor leaves the room
emma is in a terrible quandary i should take her to malvern
i think it is better she is here
gully can care for her properly there
she can be treated daily as i was
she is better with us
with her family
please do not take her away from me
parslow enters to find his master staring vacantly into space
the page in front of him is still blank
the study is in chaos
it seems as though the contents of the black box have multiplied and spread out to colonize every corner of the room
post for you sir
he leaves it by darwins elbow and backs out
after a while darwin seems to rouse himself
he picks up the largest envelope postmarked malaysia and slits it with a letter knife
the sender is a mr wallace
theres a covering letter and a twenty page attachment darwin reads and lets out a sudden loud bellow of laughter
darwin sits in sunshine at the rear of the house rugged up against the cold
looking frail still but oddly at peace
ah there you are mr darwin
darwin looks up blinking in the sunlight to see the stocky dark suited figure of mr innes
may i join you
by odd means he makes some space on the bench
innes hesitates unable to read darwins feelings towards him
the smile is welcoming enough but there is something not altogether balanced about it mrs darwin informed me you would be alone and
perhaps a need to counsel
he sees an envelope on the ground and stoops to retrieve it
you dropped this
what a beautiful postage stamp
it is from the spice islands
i do rather envy your wide circle of correspondents
in my youth i always wanted to travel
you are still young
you could be a missionary and follow in mr livingstones footsteps
yes although i have always felt there is quite enough evil at home without looking for it abroad
then casually mrs darwin told me of the book you are writing
not any more thank goodness you have finished it
it has been finished for me
my correspondent in the spice islands has arrived independently at exactly the same idea expressed in a mere twenty pages
darwin contd theres brevity for you
i had so far covered two hundred an fifty and come to a dead end
so finally i am rid of the project
innes is relieved to hear it the lord moves in mysterious ways
he does indeed mr innes
i was reflecting only the other day on the fact that he has endowed us in his blessed generosity with not one but nine hundred species of intestinal worm each
with its own unique method of infiltrating the blood supply and burrowing through the mucosa
innes shifts uncomfortably
and then again on the great love he shows for butterflies by inventing a wasp to lay eggs inside the living flesh of caterpillars well
it is not for us to guess at his reasons
we can leave that for mr wallace now
should i advise him to stay overseas do you think
if he shows his face in kent he may be required to kneel on rock salt
hes a short man acutely aware of any threats to his dignity and hes had enough of this mockery i once valued our friendship mr darwin
i had hoped it might be possible to restore it
clearly in your present mood that is not going to be possible
my regards to mrs darwin he starts off round the corner of the house
darwin listens to his footsteps receding then turns his face back to the sun
when he opens his eyes sees a figure standing in the lawn
it is annie plain as day scowling at him angrily
i am forestalled by mr wallace
that is the simple fact of it
what reason do you have to be angry
she shoots him a look of hatred then turns away from him and runs off towards the meadow
darwin instantly remorseful gets to his feet and hurries after her
he reaches the centre of the lawn and stopped by a sudden intense pain in the gut which strikes him like a blow and fells him to his knees
he lies their gasping his vision clouding as the pages of the wallace letter slip from his grasp and are scattered to the wind
a view from high above spiralling downwards on the darwin garden as household servants emerge from various quarters and hurry to his assistance
there are some faint stains on the plasterwork of the bedroom ceiling
like lichen on a rock
like an archipelago of islands
darwin lies pale and weak looking upwards from a sea of white blankets
the door opens and he turns his head
you have a visitor
i will not be bled or lectured to
she gives him a pinched look then hooker pushes in behind her
it is me
thank god you are still with us
word came from london you had suffered an apoplectic stroke
simply the great relief of liberation
did you read the wallace abstract
hooker bats the idea away it is a letter
you have a book barely half of it you have a book
what is not already on the page is most certainly inside your head and i intend to extract it if it kills us both
you have been talking to huxley
had i done so he would have hastened here himself armed with every instrument of torture known to her majestys navy
then charles i have read the first chapters
it is brilliant
you must continue
seriously joseph i am completely blocked
all my old symptoms have returned with a vengeance
the sweats the shakes the abdominal pains
the whole endeavour was cursed from the outset
hooker takes darwins hand presses it to stop it from trembling charles
it was you who opened my eyes to the wonders of science
so let me open yours
you have an illness
you have had it as long as i have known you
hooker contd it is clearly made worse in times of overwork but the nature of the work is irrelevant
this is not visited on you by god or the devil
this is a set of physical symptoms
go to malvern and get treated
not malvern why not
what is there to be scared of there
he has worked for you in the past it will work again
then come back and finish the book
your enemies are already toasting their good fortune but they shall not prevail
what are you talking about
i have no enemies
they are legion believe me and they are implacable
we are all of us fighting a battle against fear and superstition but we can win this battle
we must win it
you can win it for all of us
go to malvern then come back and finish it
upstairs servants are packing for a journey
the vigorous darwin of the past moves swiftly from room to room gathering his things
hat and gloves books spectacles papers
emma eight months pregnant tries to keep up with him charles please reconsider emma it is weeks now months
she is getting worse not better
then i am coming with you
you cannot come
how can you possibly come in your condition
it is not so far
it is two days by coach and train
who will look after the others
i do not care for the others
i care for annie
etty coming apon then unexpectedly hears this and is instantly heartbroken
emma is devastated by the slip but is presently too overwrought to retract it
leave us please etty
parslow has gathered up annie from her room and is carrying her downstairs pale and sickly looking with brodie fussing behind
make sure she is tucked in
watch her shawl i dont need to go
at the bottom of the stairs darwin takes annie from parslows arms the coach is outside
i will carry her from here
she clasps emmas hand
darwin keeps heading for the door
emma holds fast to annies hand and follows behind you will see mamma when you are better
say goodbye now
parslow holds the door open
the coach is at the gate
emma stops on the threshold unable to let go her daughters hand and suddenly deeply convinced that she is making a mistake here
i am coming with you please emma wait there
she hurries back inside
darwin makes a decision and heads for the coach
down the patch and through the open gate with the servants following
brodie shouts back mama
the garden gate clangs shut behind them
emma looks out of the upstairs window realizes they plan to leave without her and hurries downstairs again
charles bundles annie inside
to the coachman go
the coach sets off
emma runs to the gate calling desperately
charles feeble and debilitated levers himself into the coach with parslow assisting and slumps back in the leather upholstery
servants gather at the gate
some of them tearful not expecting him to return a steam train comes charging past trailing plumes of black smoke striking sparks from the track with its wheels
the sickly darwin of the present sits hunched and nauseous with parslow sitting beside him with his suitcase on his lap
every jolt of the train sends a spasm of pain through darwins guts
the people sitting opposite a woman a child and a man regard darwin in silence
whatever he suffers from its not good and they are worried about getting infected with it they plunge into a tunnel
the carriage fills with smoke
parslow gets up and tries to close the window but it wont budge
a burning ember flies inside and lands on darwins leg
darwin is too weak to lift a finger
parslow slaps the ember and extinguishes it
the train wheezes to a halt
the doors open and the train disgorges its cargo of sick people come to malvern for treatment a coughing child a woman with one side of her face aflame with
shingles the halt the lame and the afflicted
darwin sits in the back as the attendant drives them through malvern
tell him not this way
loudly hello there
can we go by the other route the worcester road is shorter
by the low road
he wishes to go by the other route
with a sigh as you will sir
he backs up the horses and turns the cart around dr gully is the chief physician at malvern spa
his marble tiled consulting rooms resound with the sound of rumbling pipes and dripping water
darwin reclines on a leather couch watching the watery play of light on the ceiling
a door opens and dr gully comes in accompanied by two assistants
gully is a small dapper man wearing an apron over his shirt and tie
his trousers are tucked into calf length wellington boots
he greets darwin cheerfully effusively
mr darwin old friend
it has been too long i fear
tut tut tut tut tut
what have we now what have we now
he clasps darwins hand feeling his pulse at the wrist then commands him to open his mouth tongue
darwin shows him
let me feel your liver
darwin untucks his shirt
gully prods at darwins belly
pulse hectic togue furred liver tender and enlarged
darwins ink stained fingers speak volumes
no doubt you have been exercising your brain every hour that god gave you
i was persuaded to write book
madness there are far too many of those already
are you sleeping
i suppose never taking the c dilution of chelidonium
shakes his head i had the gardener build a water tower
it no longer has any effect
of course not
your gardener is not a hydrotherapist
what on earth possessed you
i feared i was dying
oh come come come
we shall not have that talk here
half turning to his assistant who is staking notes
a smart spinal scrub
cold douche daily at
wrapping in towels and sweating by the lamp
then to darwin no red meat no reading no mental agitation of any kind
we shall soon have you right old friend we shall have you right
music over darwin sits in a deep metal bath while one of gullys assistants scrubs his spine with a loofah
darwin stands in a shaft of light grabbing onto the hand rails as the icy flood continues to crash down on his shoulders splintering and fracturing in the shaft of
two assistants bind him tight in damp linen sheets til he is immobilised like a cocoon with his legs together and his hands by his side
they pick him up and lie him down quite rigid beside another pod like creature similarly swaddled with a red face and a beard
mr darwin is it
darwin nods unable to turn his head or make any gesture with his hands
the stranger continues to talk to him nonetheless
william carter of southampton
i read your beagle account many years ago
former naval man myself
what brings you here
myself a bilious fever with blood per rectum but i have every faith in gully
the man is a miracle worker
darwin sits with a blanket draped over his shoulders under the merciless glare of a heat lamp
sweat pours off him and forms puddles at his feet
a bright sunny day
darwin looking weak but purged sits on the terrace sipping a glass of foul tasting mineral water and looking out over the stone houses fields and valleys of malvern
gully sits with him interviewing him
what action do you most associate with the symptoms
does the exercise of memory count as an action
memory of what
my eldest daughter
you remember her
you must accept there was nothing more we could do
i know that
a long awkward silence neither of them wants to recapitulate the events of annies death
you say you were writing about her
it is a scientific text
but i had reached a point beyond which it was impossible to progress
she had been my companion throughout
now it seemed she was ahead of me in a place i could not follow
plainly she is in heaven
that is what my wife believes
it is a great consolation to her but not to you
emma and i have become
divided on it
does it affect your marital relations
we have none
to speak of
a beat are you familiar with the writings of dequincy
there is no such thing known to the mind as forgetting
i dont know what it means
he suggests we have thoughts which do not actually enter the realm of consciousness
nervous fibres exist after all throughout the whole body
is it not possible that certain primal feelings manifest in some physical way
might some blocked passion imitate a gall stone
or even manufacture one
well until someone devises a machine to read nervous impulses or a telescope to look inside the body i suppose we can only guess at it
we can mr darwin
we can look inside you
if you find yourself open to it there is a way of seeing
darwin wanders the cobbled streets of malvern pausing occasionally to consult a hand written address
it is starting to rain as finally he arrives at the address he is looking for
a substantial terraced house
darwin descends a stone staircase to the imposing front door and rings the bell
as he waits for an answer a woman appears unseen in the rain streaked window above observing him
darwin rings again
a moment later the woman answers the door
mrs st john
the room is large and hot crowded with pot plants and bric a brac
various fringed lamp shades a dancing shiva a framed picture of lourdes and some illustrations from the tarot
none of this inspires darwin with confidence
just leave your coat on the table
sit down here
show me your palm
the husky voice and the plunging decollete troubles darwin who hesitates
what is it you do exactly
i envision whats inside your belly dear
thats what you wanted isnt it
when gully described you i fancied some scientific instrument
depends what you class an instrument
in more resistant cases i might use a pendulum
its ten shillings for a reading by the way
i have a ten shilling note here in my wallet
he doesnt take it out
if you can tell me the numbers on it we can begin
mr st john face hardens
coldly im a professional lady mr darwin
i dont do party tricks
i am a professional man
and i asking for no more than i ask of all my colleagues a demonstration of competence
it is you who are here to be tested sir not me
then i am sorry to have wasted your time
he puts his jacket back on and heads for the door
mrs st john follows him
as he reaches for the doorhandle and opens it she says shes with you you know that
your little girl
i saw her from the window standing at the top of the steps
how dare you
prey on peoples grief like this
i have done no such thing
furious do you take me for an idiot
clearly gully has appraised you of my history
i beg to inform you he did no such thing
it is chicanery of the very lowest order and i despise it utterly
darwin steps outside and she slams the door on him
darwin continues to rant at the closed door standing in the pouring rain without his umbrella
he gets to the top of the steps and looks around trying to get his bearings
in a pool of lamp light at the far end of the street a figure stands watching him
darwin squints at her through the rain which is falling harder now
the figure is annie
she looks at him crossly then heads off up a cobbled side street
darwin pursues his daughter up narrow cobbled lanes
the rain is getting heavier turning the gutters into rivers
water overflows the drains and culverts and rushes over the cobbles making them slick and treacherous
darwin hurries down darkened lanes and alleys the sound of rushing water echoing all around the little girl always ahead of him
a drunk man in oilskins comes barreling past him head down cursing the weather
a childs ball goes floating downhill in the current
darwin loses annie then he sees her again at the top of a steep flight of stone steps
darwin drenched chases after her
at the top of the steps he stops for breath and he looks around
there is no sign of annie but he knows this street the worcester road a row of grey georgian houses their backs against the hill their sloping front gardens looking
out over the rooftops of malvern
most of the street is in darkness but the house directly opposite has lights in the window
he knows this house also
he hesitates then crosses the street towards it
soaked to the skin he raps with the brass door knocker then waits for someone to answer
then a man answers from within
is mrs carey still the landlady here
the door opens on a chain
my daughter annie
lodged here some years ago
can i come in
the man closes the door to release the chain then opens it again to admit darwin
i know this is an intrusion
i wonder could i visit the room she stayed in
the landlord doesnt know what to make of this wait here
ill get the missus
he leaves darwin dripping in the hallway which he goes and consults with his wife in the lighted parlour
darwin looks around
this place is all too familiar to him the bevelled gold rimmed mirror the carved mock tudor coat stand
muffled conversation off
there are crutches and walking sticks among the umbrellas
lavender potpourri in a brass dish
a wheel chair in one corner a picture of the pieta above the door
finally the land lady emerges from her parlour
i would only be there ten minutes
i am happy to pay
she goes into an alcove and emerges with a key
up one flight and along the corridor to the right
try not to touch anything
darwin climbs the stairs to the landing
the younger darwin flees up the stairs
the older darwin reaches the top of the stairs and walks along the corridor to the right
the younger darwin races along the corridor
the older darwin hesitates chest pounding outside the door of number then unlocks it as
the younger darwin bursts into room and takes in the scene
the room is full if light
a maid is bundling soiled sheets
brodie is there with a harrassed looking dr gully
they turn as he enters
annie lies on the bed between them her breathing fast and shallow
she manages a weak smile
is she any better
does she want for anything
gully stands up from the bed
his expression tells us hope is fading
annies pale sunken cheeks and caked lips confirm it
darwin kneels by her bedside clasps her little hand is his own
i am here now
annie lets out a reedy whine of appreciation and strokes his lapel making him beautiful brodie cannot bear it and bursts into tears
darwin sits up writing to emma crying as he writes
i think it best for you to know how every hour passes
its a relief for me to tell you
whilst writing to you i can cry tranquilly
a local surgeon lays out various instruments including a glass syringe with a long needle
annie struggles and whimpers
brodie comforts her mr coates the surgeon came today to draw off annies water
this did not hurt her but she struggled with surprising strength against being uncovered
it will all soon be over
darwin enters through the heavy stone entrance
the relatives of the sick stand or sit among the pews arriving praying departing darwin kneels awkwardly in front of the altar clasps his hands together and prays save her
i will believe whatever
please save her he looks up at the image of christ on the cross hoping against all reason for some sense of epiphany
its not working
he feels nothing embarrassment at the cheapness of the gesture
darwin sits alone with annie who is babbling incoherently
he cant make out anything she says our dear child has taken a turn for the worse
she talked a great deal but we could seldom make out anything
much of what she says we cannot make out from the roughness of her poor mouth
dr gully leaves the surgeon arrives
the maids squeeze between the two medical men bundling sheets today she vomited rather much again
dr coates has been to draw off more water
brodie and the maid roll annie on her side and cut off the tail of her shirt then roll her on her back again with a pillow between her two
is that good my lovely suddenly lucid beautifully good
i am making custards
gully thinks her in imminent danger
heavily pregnant emma sits in the drawing room crying and reading darwins latest letter
we sponged her with water and vinegar made her sweet with chloride of lime
i fear we must prepare ourselves for the worst it is midnight darwin exhausted keeps a lonely vigil by annies bedside
each breath seems like it will be her last
suddenly she speaks faintly but audibly the rabbit
the rabbit taught him the polka
i dont understand my love
tell me about jenny
darwin bends low to hear her more clearly
what about her
when she died i dont want to talk about death my love
but tell me
i like it
what the keeper told me was
when she was very sick with pneumonia lying very still he tried to feed her but she shook her head looking at him as though to say its nice of
you but really you shouldnt bother
and as he bent down to take the spoon away she brought her arms around his neck and kissed him
and then she was dead
annie smiles puts her hands around her fathers neck and dies
darwin sits his face wet with tears reading through blurred vision a letter from emma
i was in the garden looking at our poor darlings little flower bed when john griffiths drove up with your letter
emma goes to bed utterly drained
when i went to bed i felt as if it had all happened long ago
when the blow comes it wipes out all that preceded it
she opens the curtains on a bright day
the other children are playing in the garden my feeling of longing for our lost treasure makes me feel painfully indifferent to the other children but i shall get right
darwin sits in the train heading home from malvern
he is looking across the carriage at his younger self re reading the letter and weeping uncontrollably
torrential rain crashes down on the house the garden the ancient trees and the outbuildings flooding the path and the lane beyond the gate
darwin pays the coachman and hurries inside emma is playing a beautiful slow nocturne
the rain outside drown out all other side
she doesnt notice the figure of darwin until he appears like a ghost reflected in the polished wood of the piano
she turns with a start and sees him still in his dripping coat hair plastered over his brow sorry
i startled you
take your coat off by the fire there
what time is it
darwin stays where he is dripping on the carpet we need to talk
i need to talk to you
of course but dry your hair
i shall call for a towel
as she moves to the bell pull he grabs her wrist i went back to worcester road
i saw annie
let me tell you
i dont want to hear it
this must stop
you dont understand
do you think me deaf and blind
you have lived with her and spoken with her every day since she died
parslow comes in with firewood then sees emma yelling at darwin and hurriedly retreats spilling logs in the hallway
she is more real to you than i am
shes dead charles
i know that
then what is wrong with you that even our poor daughter cannot be left in her grave but you would
i know she is dead
i know it
it is you who will not accept the fact preferring to think of her in heaven
the unspoken argument which has been brewing for a decade never before expressed so bluntly
emma heads for the door get away from me
she heads into the hallway he follows her ranting snowy white wings and dancing with the angels
is that your idea of honesty
servants scramble out of sight and out of earshot why did you come back
i will not hear this
emma picks up her skirts and hurries up the stairs
darwin pursues her
on the landing betty and horace wide eyed and terrified are bundled into the nursery by brodie as charles thunders up the stair
you have to emma everything these was between us is gone
the boat is wrecked and sunk now
we have to hold to something else
to the truth of what we know it
she slams the bedroom door on him and bolts it
open this door emma
the truth how wonderful and extraordinary our daughter was
through the door i know that
i do not need you to say it
of course i know
charles throws his shoulder to the door and bursts through it
emma screams but free of the fantasy free of the rest the silly vain hope that we will be reunited in heaven and the nagging unspoken belief that i killed
in the lower hallway all the servants hear this in the nursery brodie aghast covers the childrens ears in the bedroom emma has nowhere left to run i have never
said that say it now
and all the rest that follows
that i should have kept annie warm that day on the beach
i should not have taken her to malvern
i should have let you come
tears spring to her eyes and to his
the fury has gone from both of them leaving sadness and pity i should have insisted
it was me
i took her from you it was my fault
i could have followed
i was her mother what was i thinking of
we thought she would live
you were not to know
he moves to her she startles then lets him enfold her in his damp coat i did
i did know
i knew when you left that i would never see her again
i hated you for taking her
i hated myself
i knew that none of them could save her
charles contd all i could do was watch hopelessly and weep for her then flee the place in terror not even waiting to see our poor dear daughter buried
she was our treasure and i failed her
we both did
we should never have married each other
what are you saying
i am saying that you and i in making our perfect child endowed her with the very weakness which killed her
that is what i couldnt write
that is what forestalled me all these years
it wasnt you i was angry with it wasnt innes and it wasnt god
i was angry with my theory
it was the truth i was angry with
it is the truth
weeping she shakes her head in furious denial
he kisses her hair her eyes her tear streaked cheeks
rain continues to batter the house outside inside darwin and emma make love with a kind of wild desperation their clothes strewn all over the floor clinging to each other
like castaways in a storm
darwin enters his office
the chaos that existed here previously has been tidied away into files and boxes
darwin opens the black box takes out the files places them on his desk then sits down and begins to write darwin sits at his desk
he is possessed of a new sense of calm and purpose the pen gliding fluently across the page
night turns to day and then to night again
darwin completes the chapter headed variation under domestication and begins on a fresh sheet of paper
crocuses are pushing up through the flower beds
tiny green buds have started to emerge from the dead black branches still darwin writes tell me a story
im busy annie
petulantly ill go away again then youll be sorry
all right come here come here
she comes and sits on his lap
once there was a man who while travelling in south america came apon a beautiful and dangerous idea
darwin is in the south american jungle trying to coax down from the trees some small squeaking creature a tousled looking abandoned chick
come on come on then the creature draws closer eyes like gimlets in the dark foliage
i wont hurt you
he reaches into the dark recesses of the forest
darwin grabs it and stuffs it squawking into his collecting bag
darwin comes in empties the bag into a black box with perforations and closes the lid he knew his wife wouldnt care for this creature so when he came home
he locked it in a box where it couldnt run around and do any damage
darwin works at his desk
theres a plaintive cooing sound coming from the box next to his feet
but every so often hed open the lid and feed it just because he couldnt bear to let it die
finally he opens the lid and offers the creature a biscuit
it has grown a bit larger and made itself a nest
it takes the biscuit and peeps gratefully
darwin goes to the box and opens it
theres nothing there but an empty nest and some broken eggshells
one day he opened the box and discovered it wasnt in there at all
it had escaped with all its babies who were nesting all over the house making a terrible mess
the darwins their children and their servants run around the house finding birds everywhere
there is bird shit on the curtains and the antimacassars birds nesting in the sewing basket the bread bin and the dress up box
every time you open a cupboard angry birds fly out and flap angrily around the room
the house is in uproar
but finally they caught them all and bundled them in a blanket and he asked his wife to dispose of them as she saw fit
annie listens entranced
darwin pauses and what did she do
i dont know but i fancy she took them out in the garden and set them free
emma and brodie come out carrying a huge white linen bag between them
they shake it out in the garden and birds come pouring out of it
high shot looking down on emma as she watches the birds wheeling round and round in the sky above
darwin sits in his study window watching a great flock of birds wheeling in the sky outside the whole flock forming an ever changing shape from the movement of its
tiny component parts
darwin puts down his pen waking as if from a dream
the manuscript is finished
the music of chopin filters up from downstairs
emma is playing by candle light
darwin places the manuscript on top of the piano
she stops abruptly
the last chord resonates in the musky air
i have finally got it out of the air and into these pages
will you read it and decide what must be done with it
i confess i no longer know and i am very tired
she takes his hand and squeezes it
emma sits at the table and begins to read
darwin gets out of the bath and towels himself dry
emma lights a candle from the one before and continues to read
charles lowers himself into the bed sleep washes over him like a wave
still emma reads
thus from the war of nature from famine and death the most exalted objects we can conceive directly follow
there is a grandeur in this view of life in which endless forms most beautiful and wonderful have been and are being evolved
outside the sky is growing lighter
he opens the curtains on a clear autumn day
the house is unusually quiet
the grandfather clock on the landing strikes mid day
darwin goes downstairs
he enters the drawing room
there is no sign of emma nor of his manuscript
he goes to the window and sees her at the bottom of the garden standing over a bonfire burning something
darwin goes outside
she looks up from the fire
darwin crosses the lawn to her
shes burning leaves and dead heads from the flower garden
did you read it
i wrapped it and put it on the table there
theres a brown paper parcel on the garden table where they like to sit under the big cyprus tree
darwin picks it up it is addressed to john murray publisher stamped and sealed with sealing wax
true or not it must all be said
probably most of it is true
god help us
darwin kisses her
i have soot all over my hands
darwin stands with the brown paper package turning it over in his hands
dear hooker i have today despatched to john murray the completed manuscript
who knows if anyone will buy it and how they will respond
no doubt many will wish al diabolo altogether
but least it is out in the world now and no longer torturing me
john griffiths the postman comes up the hill from the village
darwin gives him the manuscript
the postman puts it in his satchel and heads on up the lane
darwin turns back and walks up towards the house
as he does so a little figure annie takes his hand and together they continue on home annie skipping happily by her fathers side
darwins origin of species was sold out on its day of publication
a classic to this day it was reprinted six times before his death and his burial with full christian honours in westminster abbey
