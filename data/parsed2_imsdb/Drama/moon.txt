written by nathan parker story by duncan jones november helium is a gas ejected from the surface of the sun and blown through space by solar winds
it plays an essential role in cold fusion often toted as the solution to humanitys future energy needs
there is one major problem
helium is extremely scarce on earth
the gas does however exist in abundance on the earths only natural satellite the moon
should we turn to cold fusion in the future it is conceivable that man will mine the moon for helium and bring the precious gas back to earth
we hear something a machine churning and pounding
though the sound is slightly familiar were not sure what it is yet
hold for a few seconds and then the sound belongs to a regular old treadmill like you see in most gyms across the world
running on it sam bell mid thirties thick beard handsome striking blue eyes
sams face is flushed and glistening with sweat
he lunges for a towel draped over the treadmills bar dabs his face as he runs
we see outside the window a gray powdery landscape stretching beneath a black sky
aerial view of the earths only natural satellite the camera roaming about a hundred feet off the surface
serious uncompromising desolation
this place makes antarctica look like tokyo
and utter silence
eventually the camera arrives at a moon base diving down towards it sam takes a shower treading in a tight circle beneath the nozzle eyes closed hot water blasting his
his hair still wet from the shower sam sits before a comms unit dressed in a lunar industries boiler suit a zip up the front colorful patches sewn into the
he begins to record a message
how are you sweetheart
its the morning here
in a few minutes gerty and i will sit down for breakfast go over the days itinerary
as sam continues his message we are given a tour of the mining base
beginning with this is where you want to be if the shit hits the fan
the bases equivalent of hq
a wall of computers and flickering digital displays
today begins my th week on selene
i officially have two weeks to go before i climb into that return vehicle
a small space craft attached to the base
it is essentially a tiny room with a coffin like sealed bed in the middle of it a cryogenic pod with an array of complicated controls surrounding it
and blast home
sam spends most of his time here
it is kitchen and play room combined
we pick out a television set an armchair a ping pong table the treadmill
i never dreamed id make it this far
on a table we also pick out a large model carved out of bolser wood
its a town
intricately done down to the tiniest details
there were times as you know
we go even closer to the model seeing that there are actual people actual characters in the little town actual buildings a church a town hall etc
clearly someone has put a ton of work into this thing
when i thought i was going to crack up
and the tour of the base continues
onto a new room
a dark storage area sam has repurposed to grow a handful of plants
they sit surrounded by darkness glowing under pools of artificial light
but i think ive come out the other side now
a strange angular room obviously purposeful but its design more geared to a computer than a human being
a single bed dominates
in many ways this place is all about contradictions
the empty terrain surrounding the mining base as viewed from the monitoring station window
across the landscape a mountain rises from the morning shadows
its bleak its beautiful
some kind of rake or shovel half buried in the powdery soil like a childs toy abandoned in a sand box
its barren yet filled with riches
from up here it is easy to see why the earth is sometimes referred to as the blue marble
a swirl of color
the earth is thousands and thousands of miles away but sometimes looks so close i feel like i could reach out and snatch it with my hand
sams bed a new york jets poster on the wall a few knickknacks bedside rock samples in jars a lucky tambourine sam got in mexico some years ago a red
stress ball a photograph by the bed in a frame im incredibly lonely yet im never alone
we move closer to the photo by the bed
of a slightly younger and clean shaven sam with his arms wrapped around his wife of four years tess bell
because i have you
tess is a far cry from the stereotypical astronauts wife of the s s with the plastic smile and beehive hairdo
tess is modern sophisticated and jaw droppingly beautiful
she looks like shed be a hard woman to leave behind
note in the photograph tess is visibly pregnant
and i have eve
i dont take you guys for granted
you know that now
back with sam at the comms unit as he wraps up the message
please kiss eve for me
and tell her daddy will only be away a little longer seventeen days longer approximately
i love you both dearly
and he sends the message
the main corridor connecting the different rooms
weve seen everything there is to see now
the base is small
it is easy to imagine how someone could crack up here
sam leaves the comms room and heads down the corridor
a state of the art robot a gerty known simply as gerty is preparing sams breakfast
gerty is in three sections and moves along a horizontal rail that runs throughout the base
he has a readout screen that perpetually spews data
his hands resemble pincers but are perfectly nimble
for the purposes of helping run the base and looking after sam gerty is as good as human if not better
how are you today
im very well
hows your headache
much better thanks pal
sam treats gerty more like a person than a robot
whether this is down to gertys intelligence or sams desperation for company isnt clear just yet
note gerty talks like a well educated older man
his language doesnt have a great deal of inflection i
monotone but he is friendly enough
sam switches a dial on a radio but gets nothing but static he sticks in a mini cd and skips the first few tracks
we hear brief clips of talk radio and shuttle through it before he allows it to play on on some random american station an old weather report its a hot
one on the east coast temperatures soaring to a high of ninety three degrees in new york city they zip around the tiny kitchen together preparing sams breakfast working as a team
we take in the whole moon at once
gray colorless eerie
from this distance the surface resembling plaster of paris
sam sits before selenes main computer known as the old man
data flickering off sams face
he is making a log entry
a clock is running on the monitor
all harvesters running smoothly this morning
readouts are as follows matthew
sam continues with his entry while we
gerty is selecting food for the up coming week stacking ready meals on a small fork lift buggy
the ping ping ping of an alarm
sam stands before the big board
the names of the four harvesters matthew mark luke john in a collum
the red light is flashing next to matthew
sam presses an intercom button dips down speaks into it
gerty weve got a live one on mark
im going out now to rope her in
sam heads off
resembling an unmanned puppet
sam begins to insinuate his body into the suit
three rovers moon buggies parked in their separate bays
the rovers are caked in lunar soil as though sand blasted
in his space suit sam bends into one of the rovers starts the engine
sam drives along dwarfed by an enormous lunar bolder and the rising slopes of the valley beyond
a toy car in this vast and alien terrain
the second in a fleet of four harvesters this one known as mark collecting lunar soil
the harvester resembles a tank and kicks up clouds of dust
booming hulking efficient
sam catches up in his rover and accelerates into the back of the harvester up a couple of ramps
an intricate and dangerous maneuver he executes deftly
sam is in an area of the harvester a kind of hatch not dissimilar to a garage and known as the belly
once safely inside sam closes the door
he is able to breathe in the belly without his helmet which he duly removes
sam steps up to a wall of computers
a light is flashing to indicate one of the pods is filled with helium
sam does his thing eventually removing a keg size pod of helium
he hauls it over to the rover and sticks it in a special slot in the equivalent of the rovers trunk
a new pod an empty replaces the pod sam just removed
sam puts his helmet back on returns to the rover reverses out of the harvester carefully
sam snakes through the soil on his way back to base the tracks of the rover as sharp as if they had been made through talcum powder
the harvester churns into the distance
sam loads the filled pod into a cargo container
the cargo container is about the size of a fridge and can take a maximum of five pods
there are four pods already inside sams new pod taking up the fifth and final slot
sam is seated at the comms unit recording a message for his superiors back on earth
sam bell reporting to central
less formal overmeyers thompson
how goes it
ive got a full container of helium ready to roll
the purity is pretty good so assuming your last market prices are still relevant i think you are looking at getting about million dollars per kilo with this load
by the time this message reaches you it should be in transit
a beat otherwise everything running smoothly
there was a discrepancy between a couple of the n modulators a couple of days ago but gerty and i caught it in time no big deal
how are things down there
sam desperately wants to talk but has nothing very important to say
then he remembers something
oh and i just wanted to thank you for sending out the football feed
almost felt live
getting pissed off seriously i dont mean to be an asshole but surely replacing one satellite cant be that fucking hard
i havent been able to have a conversation with my wife
my kid can talk now
sam concentrates getting a grip on his temper
three years is a long haul
if you guys want to run some psych evals on me when i get back im happy to do it
it aint disney world up here
a beat thats it
over and out
sam reaches forward sends the message
sam is loading the cargo container into the bases maglev launcher
he works with a sense of routine far away preoccupied
all of a sudden sam stops
he has the feeling someone is standing behind him
he slowly turns
a girl is standing in the doorway watching him
she is perhaps fifteen or sixteen years old
a yellow dress
long wheat colored hair
at once beautiful and haunting
sam gets the fright of his life
he flies against the wall
widen to reveal sam and the girl facing off
sam pop eyed and shaking
the girl immobile arms at her sides head tilted ever so slightly to one side
the cargo container is sent hurtling through space
a terrific blast
it distracts sams attention breaks his stare
and just like that the girl is gone
sam is just staring at an empty doorway
sam is baffled
had to be his imagination
had to be
after a few seconds he shakes his head dismissively and continues working
gerty is cutting sams hair
sam sitting back in a chair barber shop style while the robot snip snip snips away with a pair of scissors
sam is gently squeezing a stress ball in his right hand
sam is everything okay
everythings fine gerty
for a moment there is no sound but the snipping scissors reminiscent of keys snapping on a typewriter
why do you ask
you dont seem like yourself today
sam frowns contemplative
for a moment we think he is going to tell gerty about the girl he saw earlier or imagined he saw
but he goes with something different
has something happened
no not exactly
gerty stops cutting lowers the scissors
sam what is it
something doesnt feel right thats all
sams fingers twitching around the red stress ball squeezing harder
sam it might help to talk about it
sam decides to come clean
tess isnt responding to things
tess isnt responding to things
what kind of things
a beat a couple of weeks ago i asked her if she wanted to go on vacation when i get back and that i was thinking of either mexico or
tess never said anything about it
three messages shes sent me since
and shes never once mentioned the vacation
im sure she cant wait sam
thats not the point
this is someone who lives for vacations and travelling
i thought shed jump at the chance for us to go away with eve of course wed take eve
perhaps tess didnt receive the message
as if anticipating gertys comment but this isnt the only time its happened gerty
when i asked her how her dad was doing on his new heart medicine she didnt respond to that i asked her when eve was going to start nursery nothing
had her brother got the position at the university
sam is really having a go at the stress ball now
i think her brother did get the position at the university
his name is christopher correct
yes i seem to recall he got the position
professor of biochemistry i think
at syracuse university in new york
sam is slightly alarmed that gerty knows this and he doesnt
how do you know that
you told me
some time ago now
towards the beginning of your time on selene
when we were starting to get to know each other
a beat you were very happy for your brother in law
you danced around the rec room if i remember correctly
sam looks perturbed
for a few seconds hed eased up on the stress ball
he starts up on it again now
gerty have you heard anything new about anyone fixing lunar sat
from what i understand its fairly low on the companies priority list with the jupiter mission active
i would imagine it would be very expensive to fix
sam still looks troubled
sam are you ok
they need to sort that out
ive only got two weeks left
its not fair on whoevers up here next
gerty you tell them to sort it out
its not healthy
i will sam
do you want me to finish cutting your hair later
lets finish this
gerty resumes cutting sams hair and stops again sensing sam is going to say something more
the scissors freeze
ive got another one of those headaches
can you get me something for it
no not now afterwards
the scissors start up again
sam with a haircut and a neatly trimmed beard is sitting before the bolser wood model of the little town
he is arched over working away with an exacto blade squinting whittling a figure out of wood
this is difficult and complicated work and over three years sam has become highly skilled at it
sam can carve an actual person out of wood actual cheekbones actual throats actual hands its fascinating to watch
from another room sam hears the ping ping ping of an alarm
flashing on the comms unit monitor new transmission
there is a small icon of a telephone
he carefully puts down the wooden figure and the exacto blade stands and leaves the rec room
sam sits at the comms unit watching a message from his superiors overmeyers and thompson a purposeful looking woman in charge and her earnest second
the two talk rapidly and trade off like a tag team
at times their tone can be almost bizarrely whimsical
overmeyers and thompson seem to have known sam for a while but even so there is a practised casualness to the repartee
its a professional friendliness on overmeyers part no more and for thompson its merely an eagerness to be involved
delighted to hear about the latest shipment sam
according to albatross it should be landing off the california coast within the next three days
now in response to your question about the communications equipment the news is not good
sam those solar storms did a lot more damage than initially thought fixing the lunar sat is going to take some time
its a significant operation
and what with the jupiter program hemorrhaging money sam curses to himself
lunar doesnt have the budget it once did sam you know that
even the coffee machine down in the hub has been broken since i dont know when
we have to go to genesis just to get a decent cup of coffee sam
thats three buildings over
were hoping to get the live feed up and running by the fall
the good news is youll be home by then sam
you only have two weeks to go
congrat sam shuts off the message before overmeyers can pipe out his last line
sam sits before the dead screen eyes closed taking a succession of deep breaths
sam playing ping pong
he has folded up the second half of the table and is using it as a wall
the sound is rapid and rhythmic ca cluck ca cluck ca cluck
sam taking his frustration out on the little white ball
sam stands before the toilet urinating
rather ironically he is whistling im walking on sunshine focussed ahead at his reflection in the mirror angling his face admiring his haircut his beard
then he looks down to flush the toilet and his whistling abruptly stops
it looks like someone just poured a glass of cranberry juice into the toilet bowl
the red urine clouding the water like a squirt of octopus ink
yeah sam just pissed blood
there is a ping
and gertys voice crackles from the intercom
sam a transmission has arrived from your wife
sam reaches over and presses the intercom button
be right there
and he flushes the toilet
sam sitting before the monitor
he hits the play button begins watching the message
on the monitor tess is sitting in a living room talking to sam
tess has a sweet voice she sounds grounded like shes got a head on her shoulders
how are you
a beat i got your last message it was really great to hear your voice
i know youve been really lonely up there but in a lot of ways its been good for you i think
i hope you dont mind me saying that
im proud of you
a beat hey someones got something to say
a woman possibly a nanny or some form of hired help swings a little girl into tesss arms
this is eve sam and tesss daughter
eve its daddy
what did you want to say to him
eve just stares
tess whispers to her remember what we practiced etc
finally eve attempts asstraut
whos an astronaut
encouraging go on
so does sam
thats right daddys an astronaut
eve fidgets rubs her nose distracted
uh cathy could you
the maid steps in hoists eve away
tess waits until theyre out of earshot
its her birthday next month
i thought wed get her a play house for the garden
we could even pick it out together
tess just stares into the camera
she is hundreds and thousands of miles away but for a second it feels like shes right there in the comms room with sam
she finally shakes her head self conscious shy
god i hate these things
sam i love you
im thinking of you always
i cant wait to see you sweetheart
and the message ends
on sam smiling on the brink of tears
the earth at night illuminated by a glittering spiders web of artificial lighting
from the moon this is one of the most beautiful sights youll ever see
sam is in improved spirits
he pours himself a glass of juice as gerty prepares dinner
whats on the menu tonight gerty
baby back ribs with french fries and spinach
good choice pal
it might be baby back ribs with french fries and spinach but its made from a packet by adding hot water
sam sits down with the packet
digs in with a fork
compliments to the chef gerty this is delicious
sam eating ravenously
sam is in the greenhouse pruning plants with a pair of secateurs
he treads up the aisles slowly taking time with each of the plants
classical music plays over the sound system brahms beethoven bartok one of the bs
sam hums along to the music
a man at peace
sam is working on his wooden model of the town
across the room the ed sullivan show is on tv
eds guest is a very young goldie hawn
note whenever any tv is watched in the film it is always a show from s america
mash six million dollar man laugh in etc
no explanation is given for this
sam is half watching the tv but his focus is chiefly on the small house he is carving
and carving beautifully
after a few seconds he stands and snaps off the tv with a remote
he crosses to the kitchen section of the rec room to make some tea
the water has just boiled
as sam is about to pour the boiling water tea kettle in hand he glances across the rec room and sees
shes taken sams chair before the model
she is motionless staring down at the model like she recognizes one of the little figures walking the tiny streets
sam calmly puts the tea kettle down and begins to move towards the girl slowly cautiously like he wants to sneak up on her
sam walks right up to the girl and reaches out his hand
and then we cut to sam standing in the kitchen
over by the model there is no sign of the girl
the chair is empty
her sitting there sams walk across the room apparently he imagined it all
sam looks down
the tea kettle is dangling at an angle and boiling water is dribbling onto his left hand
simultaneously sam snaps his hand away sam screams
the tea kettle clatters to the floor
sam hurries to the sink and jerks his hand under a stream of cold water
cursing under his breath the whole time shit piss fuck
sam sits in a chair as gerty tends to his scolded left hand
its a nasty burn
im going to feel that for a while arent i gerty
then damn it
gerty applies a translucent balm to the burn
sam can i ask how it happened
i told you i saw something on the tv and spilled boiling water on my hand
you saw something on the tv
a touch petulant yeah something on the tv distracted me gerty whats wrong with that
gerty is wrapping sams hand with a bandage
sam you said it was the tv that distracted you but when i came in the tv wasnt on
gerty has caught him out
sam knows it
perhaps you were imagining things
gerty has hit the nail on the head in a way that makes sam feel a little uneasy
is there something gerty knows that sam doesnt
sam asleep in bed
sam making love to tess
we remain very close to their bodies in bed
the background a blur
its all flesh and white sheets
sensual delicate intense
we feel almost intrusive watching
sam wakes up and lunges across the bed to shut off his alarm clock
we notice a white bandage on the hand that he scolded
afterwards sam lies back watching the ceiling groggy reflective still surfacing from his dream
and then over this the sound from the opening of the film the treadmill and we sam on his morning run
gerty is making breakfast
sam enters fresh from the shower
how are you today
hows the hand
its a little sore
gerty pops the radio on
just another morning on selene
sam sitting before the old man doing his daily log entry
a clock is running on the monitor
readouts are as follows matthew
suddenly the monitor blips a blast of static and sam sees himself talking on the monitor
it appears to be a previous log entry
wow better look into luke
but bizarrely the sam talking on the monitor has long hair pulled back into a ponytail and no beard and then another blip another blast of static and the screen
turns completely black
a single word begins to flash in the center of the screen the word flashes three times before the screen returns to normal the clock running again
it all happened so quickly sam wonders if he didnt just imagine it
after an awkward pause he simply continues the original log entry
mark miles on the button
going ping ping ping
sam stands across the room with a mug of coffee peers up at the big board sees that the alarm belongs to matthew
he crosses to the intercom speaks into it
gerty looks like weve got a live one out on matthew
i wondered what was taking him so long the old fart
im heading out in a few minutes just going to finish my coffee
sam at the wheel in his space suit speeding towards the first of the harvesters known as matthew
as sam gets closer to the harvester he suddenly sees something the girl
she is standing maybe a hundred yards away in her yellow dress resembling a flame or a flower in the barren and colorless landscape
she appears to be staring directly at sams rover
his face unfolding with panic alarm curiosity
an intense yearning curiosity
he drives closer
but like in a dream sam cant seem to make up any distance between the rover and the girl
he crushes the accelerator peddle
for a moment sam drives right alongside the harvester clouds of lunar dust being kicked up cascading against the side window
but sam is looking away from the harvester focussed on the girl
on sam he doesnt notice matthew the harvester suddenly veer right slamming into the side of the rover and causing sam to lose control
the steering wheel swings left and right as sam desperately tries to straighten the path of the vehicle but a split second later the rover is flipped like a matchbox
and spun into the path of the harvester a hideous screech of mangled metal the rover gobbled up by the front of the harvester devoured
the rover is jammed under the harvesters monstrous axle resembling a crushed beer can in a fist and with a big booming groan the harvester slides to a standstill
wide shot silence
the harvester stationary
the rover caught beneath it
no sign of the girl
hold it for five seconds and then eyelids fluttering bright light at first broken up filtered as if viewed through a kaleidoscope
slowly shapes and impressions begin to form and we know where we are
its the infirmary
a clean shaven and drugged up sam is sitting up in bed propped with a pillow
sam doesnt have a scratch on his face but has clearly been through a terrifying ordeal
gerty is bedside
where am i
sam youre in the infirmary
you had an accident
sam looks bewildered he desperately racks his brain trying to locate the memory
do you remember what happened
a beat i dont remember a thing
sam just stares back at gerty not so much as a flicker of recognition
do you remember me
yes of course i remember you gerty
thats very good
its nice to see you awake again
a beat id like to keep you under observation here in the infirmary for a few days and run some tests
sam taking it all in
eventually how long have i been out
sam go back to sleep
youre still very tired
we can talk later
sam closes his eyes sinking deeper into his pillow
sam asleep in bed
gerty is scanning his head with a small instrument resembling a camcorder
there are readouts on a monitor showing blood flow oxygen levels and glucose metabolism in the tissues of sams brain
luke one of the harvesters crossing the lunar landscape at half speed
sam wakes up from an extended nap
he thrusts his fists into his eyes like a child yawns ferociously
no sign of the robot
sam is feeling well enough to walk
he swings his legs out of bed begins to plod around the room
he is tentative at first slow as if walking is something he is having to learn from scratch
eventually when he is moving fluidly he goes to the door and pokes his head out into the corridor
sam peers around
from another room he can hear the faint drone of voices
one of these voices belongs to gerty
the other voices are deeper faster human
the voices continue
intrigued sam presses on down the corridor
as he walks up the corridor in the direction of the comms room
sam is close enough now that he can actually hear the conversation
sam arrives at the door of the comms room and peers in
these were extraordinary circumstances as you know
gerty is installed at the comms unit
thompson and overmeyers are on the screen
the moment gerty sees sam he shuts off the monitor and the screen fizzes to black thompson and overmeyers vanishing
strange gerty appeared to have a live feed
sam youre out of bed
i wanted to stretch my legs
then what was that
weve been having some problems with the lunar sat and our live feed seems to be down
i was recording a video message for central updating them on your progress
a beat sam you need to stay in bed
youre not ready to walk around yet
sam nods vaguely turns around and heads back to the infirmary slowly
sam watching tv the muppet show the pigs in space sketch and eating dinner
hes not laughing
sam hunched over the infirmarys stainless steel wash basin giving himself a shave
he hits the razor on the side of the basin tap tap tap like a conductor with a baton
sam is seated at a table
frankly he looks better now than he did before the accident
perhaps its the rosy hue of his freshly shaven face
he certainly looks younger
a man revitalized a man mended
gerty is giving sam something very similar to an iq test
sam has just arranged a series of blocks into an l shaped tower
how much longer do i have to be in here gerty
sam you suffered minor brain damage in the crash
this has resulted in memory loss and slight logic impairment
when can i get back to work
central has asked me to slow down the harvesters to ensure you have time to recuperate and get your strength back dryly exasperated terrific
the good news is you can return to the sleeping quarters tomorrow
but it will still be a few more days before you can resume anything like a normal work schedule
sams face taught with irritation
he isnt happy
gerty gives him the next puzzle to solve
we move in on sams left hand as he takes the puzzle the same hand he scolded in an earlier scene
the bandage is gone and the burn appears to have completely sam walking down the corridor in the direction of the sleeping quarters
he stops at a red light on the corridor wall beneath it the word exit doors
hes locked inside the base
sam pulls a face disgruntled continues down the corridor
sam takes in the new york jets poster on the wall and walks over to the bed studies his lucky tambourine and the glass jar of lunar rock samples like
hes trying to reacquaint himself with his own belongings
his eyes arrive on the red stress ball
sam scoops up the ball and pitches it at the wall like he expects the thing to bounce back to him
the stress ball doesnt bounce back simply hits the wall with a dull thud and drops to the a desolation special
the blacker than black sky above
none of the ingredients of life
on earth we have rainforests and flowers and birds
we have color
up here we realize how lucky we are
the base is lit by large halogen comfort lights alone in the lunar desert
this is a lunar night
sam sitting before the old man doing a few innocuous tasks collecting readouts slurping a cup of coffee
gerty is within ear shot
sam sees something that pulls him closer to the monitor
gerty do you know about this
sam taps the screen
matthews got no velocity read out
hes completely still
he must have stalled
sam gives gerty a look
thats not good
sam is recording a message for central
theres no way to tell from here if a tracks been thrown or if its just something jammed in an axle or what
i can shoot out there check it out get some video and maybe save you guys the expense of floating in a whole crew
i know how tight money is right now
sam really frustrated now
he feels cooped up stir crazy idle
just give me the word or gerty the word tell him to unlock the exit doors and ill go out and get matthew up and running again
a beat thats it
over and out
sam sends the message
sam enters the rec room looks around his eyes settling on the model of the town
sam sits down in front of the model staring he picks up the house he was carving earlier studies it carefully
sam and gerty are seated at the comms unit watching a video message from central
sam is holding a carved house examining it as he listens to the video
the familiar faces of overmeyers and thompson on the screen shoulder to shoulder the two looking more like vultures right now than lizards
sam we appreciate the offer but you concentrate on feeling better
muttering vexed oh for christs sake
we dont want you to take any unnecessary risks
youre too important to us
youre to stay put understand
its an order
its an order sam
were going to send a rescue unit to tend to the stalled harvester and get the base back on its feet
the message ends
sam turns to gerty irate the message as good as a kick in the balls
im sorry sam
sam stares at gerty
sam i am under strict orders not to let you outside
sam throws the half completed wood carving in his hand at the other end of the room breaking it
he flies to his feet growling with frustration storms out of the room
sam asleep in bed
sam and tess making love
we remain very close to their bodies in bed
the background a blur
its the same dream we saw earlier
something is different though
we drift past sam and tess and under the sheets of the bed
down between their entwined feet huddles a bearded wide eyed sam staring directly at us from under the sheets at the end of the bed
sam is quietly eating breakfast lost in thought
gerty puttering around in the background
the radio drones away
sam is seated at the comms unit watching a message from tess
we assume this is an old message since tess is heavily her slender hands are spread over her prodigious belly as she beams at the camera
or shes kicking
im certain hes a boy
i wish you could feel it
a beat shifting i think we made the right choice sam
i really do
we need some time apart
we got stuck
that happens in marriages sometimes
its nothing terrible
then well listen i love you lots and well talk soon okay
a pop and tess is gone the monitor filled with static
sam sits staring into space
tess message seems to have agitated him
he jumps from his chair and heads out of the comms room at pace
sam strides in swipes a knife from beside the wooden model strides out again
sam glances left and right making sure theres no sign of gerty then begins to pry open a vent with the knife
once the vent is removed he reaches deep inside and yanks out a bundle of interwoven wires sam bends the wires around the blade of the knife and cuts
gas issues from the cut wires
an alarm sounds
sam hides the knife away shouts down the corridor gerty
get over here
gerty comes out of the monitoring station and shuttles down the corridor
dont know micro meteorites maybe
either way there might be damage to the exterior shell
id better go outside and take a look
there is no damage to the exterior shell
its not that i dont believe you gerty but the inner skin is springing leaks like an acme fire hose
maybe you better let me take a look just in case huh
sam im not supposed to let you go outside
then lets keep it between you and me then
the robot takes an inordinate amount of time to think this through
the syrupy gas distorts the light as it collects at sams ankles
gertys arms work away as they speedily repair the damage sam has done
finally okay sam
the exit doors light turns from red to green
for sam this is like the blast of a starting pistol he immediately takes off down the corridor sam finds his space suit is gone so grabs the spare suit
and scrambles into it
two rovers parked side by side
one of the parking bays is empty
sam stands before the empty bay for a moment why is one of the rovers missing
if sam suspected something was wrong before he is certain of it now
he climbs into one of the two remaining rovers
sam speeding along in the rover
he has matthews coordinates plugged into his navigation system and is following a map on a small monitor
sam heading towards the stalled harvester
it soon becomes apparent that there is something stuck under the front of the harvesters axle
a second later it is apparent what that something is inevitably its the missing rover
sam slows his rover down approaching the scene with caution
he parks a few feet away from the wreck and opens the door of his rover stepping outside gingerly
one sixth gravity is like walking on a trampoline
sam takes long strides bobbing over to the front of the harvester to take a closer look his boots leaving deep footprints in the lunar soil
the crashed rover is exactly as we left it after the accident mangled crushed captured beneath the trundles of the harvester
sam peers closer and sees that there is an unconscious man in a lunar industries space suit trapped inside
sam cant see the mans face he has his back to sam his body sprawled across the passenger seat like hes searching for loose change on the floor of the
with great effort sam manages to prize the rovers door open
he reaches inside and begins to pull the man out sams sheer adrenaline giving him the strength of a yeti
sam drags the unconscious man away from the crashed rover his body leaving a big track mark in the gray soil
sam takes a second to catch his breath then leans down and turns the unconscious man onto his back
he brushes dust from the glass of the mans helmet leans down even closer
through his helmet we see a bloody and bearded sam
sam as we remember him
the sam from the opening twenty minutes of the film
sams face as the panic the alarm the shock the realization hit him like a wrecking ball this man he has just pulled out of the crashed rover is himself
sam gathers his wits and manages to lift the unconscious sam up over his shoulder firemans lift style taking him to the parked rover
sam drives the rover into the dock flies out and removes his space helmet screaming gerty
he reaches into the rover lifting out the unconscious sam
he carries him in both arms staggering across the dock back arched arms beginning to sag and into the corridor
sam promptly collapses and drops the unconscious sam onto the floor
gerty approaches gliding along his rail
sam is freaking out big time exhausted panic stricken bewildered
i found him outside by the stalled harvester
who is he
what the fuck is going on
gerty literally seems lost for words
demanding an answer gerty
we need to get him to the infirmary
not until you tell me who he is
sam we need to get him to the infirmary immediately
sam scoops the unconscious sam up off the ground and lifts him towards the infirmary staggering stumbling going who is he
who is he
sounding like some deranged homeless man
gerty gliding alongside him
lying in the infirmary bed propped on a pillow is the first sam the bearded sam who we will now refer to as sam
he has a wicked black eye and a purple bruise on the right side of his face looks like he was on the losing end of a brawl
he has a drip stuck in his arm and a tangle of wires attached to his bare chest
a machine is beeping away
gerty hovers over him redressing the bandage on sam s left hand the one he scolded a while back
sam s eyes pop open he is awake staring directly at gerty
a beat how are you feeling
where am i
you had an accident out by one of the harvesters
do you remember
for a second this is playing out like the other infirmary scene
a case of deja vu
sam s eyes twitch as he catalogues through his memory
yes he remembers the crash
he remembers something else too
i saw someone out there gerty
who did you see sam
just then sam notices the other sam the more current clean shaven sam who we will now refer to as sam
he is standing against the wall watching sam
i saw a girl
you saw a girl out by the harvester
how is that possible
sam continues to stare at sam hardly believing his eyes
sam you suffered a slight concussion in the crash and have incurred minor injuries but all in all the prognosis is good
im happy to see you again
as he says this sam crosses slowly from one side of the room to the other never taking his eyes off sam
its like sam is purposefully keeping his distance reluctant afraid even to approach any closer
meanwhile sam is beginning to look spooked
is there someone in the room with us
who is he
but sam knows exactly who it is
hes seen that face every morning of his life in the bathroom mirror
sam get some sleep
youre very tired
sam wordlessly walks out of the room
sam s eyes shift to gerty the spooked expression yet to leave his face
sam hobbling along in addition to his facial injuries he injured his knee in the crash and is walking with a slight limp
the camera tracking behind sam as he swings along and stops at sam in the doorway he peers in
seated before the tv watching the newlywed game sam
he turns from the tv and shares a long look with sam
sam just nods
he turns back to the tv
sam continues on down the corridor
gerty is studying lunar rock samples through a microscope
gerty what the hell is going on
who is that guy in the rec room
where did he come from
why does he look like me
sam is perplexed but not freaking out not yet anyway
sam youre out of bed
yes gerty im out of bed
who is the guy in the rec room
sam is officially freaking out now
who the fuck is in the rec room gerty
you are sam bell
a long pause
sam at the point of tears
sam what is it
it might help to talk about it
i dont understand whats happening gerty
i think i may be losing my mind
we could run some tests
a beat i havent reported anything to central sam
they dont know you were recovered alive from the accident
what do you mean
why havent you reported to central
im here to keep you safe sam
i want to help you
are you hungry
sam merely nods at this turning and plodding out of the room seemingly in a daze
sam comes out of the monitoring station passes the rec room without looking in
sam has taken over the room
the same belongings of course but theres a different energy
for one thing its very untidy looks like the bedroom of an unruly teenager
sam stands in the doorway taking it in
wordlessly sam begins to tidy the room
he seems almost relieved to be able to lose himself temporarily in this physical activity making the bed folding clothes etc
sam has stopped watching tv and is now seated at a table playing solitaire
sam appears in the doorway
sam looks up
the energy bristling with tension
youre sam bell
sam doesnt answer goes back to his cards
sam enters with caution takes a seat across the room purposefully keeping his distance
im sam bell too
this is fucked up
sam slapping down cards
sam desperately attempts to put together a coherent thought
what are you
for a second we dont think sam is going to respond
then im a clone sam
im a fucking clone
how long have you been here
about a week
how are you getting on
repeating the question slowly how am i getting on
then the company ordered gerty to lock all the exits
i havent been able to do anything for seven days but sit on my ass
they locked all the exits
what about the harvesters
slowed them down to half speed apparently
and then when i finally trick gerty into letting me outside i find a clone of myself in a crashed rover
how am i getting on
oh im loving it
im not a clone
youre not a clone
youre the clone
the two sams are inspecting plants
how long have you been here
almost three years
hence the captains beard
with a smile right
i didnt know it could get so thick
does it itch
no not really
listen i wanted to say thank you
if it wasnt for you id still be out there in the crashed rover
you saved my life
then will you shake my hand
sam hesitates eventually shakes sam s hand
meanwhile sam is staring at his clone astonished
self conscious what
you look just like me
why do i look like you
why dont you look like me
we look like each other i guess
this final line intended as a kind of truce
sam and sam are folding the ping pong table down so they can have a real game
the two sams playing ping pong
its slightly competitive but mainly they are just happy to take their minds off their situation for half an hour
two points to eighteen
sam slaps his paddle on his thigh his temper creeping up on him
he catches sams eye
gets a grip
sam is a better player than sam
hes been up here longer
hes had more practice
after the game the two sams are sprawled in their seats sweaty flushed energized
they sit before the model of the town
how long did it take you to do this
i dont remember doing all of it
i remember when i did the church and the salvation army
and a few of the people
my minds been acting kind of weird lately though
its fairfield right
pointing theres town hall
you know fairfield
also pointing thats the baskin robbins
and theres tess and eve
do you know tess
the mention of their wife has stopped the conversation in its tracks
sam immediately drops into deep melancholy
i know tess
you know about eve right
it is obvious from sam s expression that he doesnt
we had a girl
beat she thought she was going to have a boy
she was so sure
shes really beautiful
how much did she weigh
isnt that what youre supposed to ask how much did she weigh
nine pounds eleven ounces
sam doesnt know what to do with the news on the one hand he is jubilant on the other hes a clone the baby technically isnt even his
all of a sudden there is a ping
from the intercom speaker sam a message has arrived from central
sam and sam share a look then together spring from their chairs
sam and sam seated before the comms unit
sam hits the play button
overmeyers and thompson appear on the screen
hows our man
you getting lots of rest
yeah you resting up sam
youd better be you bastard
enjoy it while it lasts
weve got good news
the jupiter program had to be put on hiatus so weve got a few free pairs of hands weve managed to secure you a rescue unit ahead of schedule
rescue unit eliza
a shot still photo of rescue unit eliza
a meaner group of sons of bitches you have never seen
these guys make the rescue team from apocalypse now look like the new kids on the block
theyve been stationed on goliath for the last couple of months
elizas been in transit for the last day
we expect them to reach you in approximately hours
commence to jump for joy
youll be back to work in no time
now back on overmeyers and thompson
eliza is bringing you something special sam
compliments of the company
no not a hooker
whats wrong with you
its a little something to drink sam thats all our way of patting you on the back for all that youve been through
in the meantime keep resting up and hang in there
yeah you hang in there sam
over and out
and the screen pops to black
for a moment there is silence neither of the sams knowing how to react going by the message thompson and overmeyers dont know anything about there being two sams on
the base now
theyre sending a rescue unit
to fix the stalled harvester
they didnt think i was up to it
then im going back
sam gives sam a perplexed look
ive done my three years
thats it for me sam is shaking his head slowly
is that what you really think
ive got a contract youre a fucking clone
you dont have shit
at once sam and sam rocket to their feet right in each others faces on the brink of blows
im going home
youre not going anywhere
sam turns around heads out of the room
sam storms after him talking the whole time youve been up here too long man
youve lost the plot
gerty shuttles along after them
sam presses down the corridor sam tailing right behind him
what you think tess is back home waiting for you
what about the original sam
im the original
im sam fucking bell
sam stress ball pumping away in his hand spots gety and angrily faces him
gerty am i a clone
gerty doesnt know which way to look
sam ducks in the rec room sam in tow
sam takes his old seat before the model
sam stands over him
what about the other clones
sam just stares back
yeah we might not be the first two to be woken up
indicating the model you said that thing had already been started when you got here
well who started it
then there might be other clones up here right now
think about it
how did i get here so quickly after your crash
they didnt ship me in from central there wasnt time
i must have come from the base
why would hey do that
i bet theres some kind of secret room laughing secret room
yeah secret room why not
losing his cool youre the one whos lost the plot
ive been here for three years
i know every inch of this base
i know how many dust fibres are between those wall panels over there why would they do that
its a company right
they have investors shareholders shit like that
spending time and money training new personnel or just have a couple of spares here to do the job
if they make it through their contract great
if they dont hallelujah
no contract completion fees no retirement package
just thaw out the spare and keep the profits rolling in
its the far side of the moon sam
the tight fucks havent even fixed our communications satellite
tess would know
do you really think they give a shit about us
theyre laughing all the way to the bank
tess would know whats going on
she wouldnt let that happen
exhasperated theres some area we dont know about
im going to find it
sam shakes his head dismissively picks up the wooden house starts whittling
meanwhile sam has left the room
sam in the monitoring station checking wall panels reaching his hand inside cubbies and feeling around deep inside searching
sam moving along the corridor pressing his ear against panels tapping with his finger sam rampages through the sleeping quarters pushes the bed aside lifts the mattress goes tearing through
a closet ripping clothes from hangers checks the back panel
sam has come full circle
he shifts the ping pong table goes through cabinets in the kitchen feels inside sam half whittling half watching
i told you
finally sam arrives before the model
get out of the way
i want to check underneath there
youre not moving the model
get the fuck out of my way
sam stands keeps his ground
sam is still holding the knife
though hes not about to use it both sams are aware that its there
suddenly sam lunges for the knife an intense struggle ensues teeth clenched sputtering breaths the two sams less clones right now than animals
sam is able to loosen sam s grip on the knife flinging the weapon across the room and swings sam up against the wall
now sam turns to face the model
using both hands he lifts the model up high over his head and pushes the entire thing upside down
a massive crash
there is nothing there but the bare table
sam comes up behind sam with his nose spewing blood wraps both arms around sam s neck
sam elbows him in the ribs a quick controlled jab spins around manages to secure sam in an arm lock
but suddenly there is no struggle coming from sam hes stopped fighting
sam removes him from the headlock notices his arm is smudged with sam s blood you okay
sam has remained bent over like hes cast in stone blood raining from his face and pooling at his feet thick and fast
sam just staring as freaked as he is baffled
i hardly touched you
now he tries to help sam
let me see
sam tears away from him
he looks up his face a mess of blood the whites of his eyes unnaturally bright shouts get off me
sam holds his face with his outstretched hand as if holding it in place stumbles from the room leaking blood the whole way
a concerned sam watches him go
sam spills in and locks the door
he rapidly turns on the faucet and cups his hand to transfer water up to his face this going on for a few seconds
sam stares at his reflection in the mirror holding a mound of toilet paper against his nose
the blood flow has subsided suddenly sam sees the girl in the mirror
it gives him a hell of a fright
the girl remains in the mirror looking at sam
a neutral expression impassive
sam takes a deep breath lowers the toilet paper from his nose
who are you
shouting who are you
sam swings around to confront the girl
but shes not there shes vanished
her reflection has vanished from the mirror also
sam snaps on the tv with the remote starts watching laugh in turns sees sam wander by in the corridor
sam considers calling out to him opts against it gives the tv his full attention
gerty is stationed at the old man collecting data
gerty turns from the monitor faces of with an exhausted and drained sam
sam is everything okay
we had a fight
me and the other guy the other sam
we had a fight gerty
hes a maniac
you know what he did
he flipped the entire model over
do you know how much work ive put into that thing
a beat he scares me gerty
what is it about sam that scares you
he flies off the handle
i see it now
i see what tess was talking about
a beat ive never told you this gerty but she left me
tess left me
for six months
she moved back in with her parents
beat it was the year before i came in here
she gave me a second chance
i promised her id change
you have changed sam
yeah i guess i have
gerty since ive been up here ive sent tess over a hundred video messages
where did those messages go
did they ever reach her
sam i can only account for what occurs on the base
what about the messages she sent to me
a long pause
finally gerty repeats sam i can only account for what occurs on the base
gerty am i really a clone
sam when you first arrived at selene there was a small crash
you woke up in the infirmary
you suffered minor brain damage and memory loss
i kept you under observation and ran some tests
sam there was no crash
you were being awakened
a beat it is standard procedure for all new clones to be given tests to establish mental stability and general physical health
genetic abnormalities and minor duplication errors in the dna can have considerable impact and tess
they are memory implants sam
im very sorry
sam nods at this
hes broken hearted
he begins to leave
sam its been several hours since your last meal
can i prepare you something
no thanks gerty
sam enters the sleeping quarters straightens the bed and lies down
he picks up the picture of the pregnant tess stares at it long and hard
the tv is off
sam is sitting arms folded entrenched in sam enters and heads for the kitchen prepares himself a snack
sam is aware that sam is there but keeps his eyes focussed forward as immobile as a statue
eventually sam tentatively comes over
im staring into space
points to the window get it
sam does get it
he smiles to be polite sits
hows the nose
listen i went haywire before
i lost it
no its not okay
i fucked up fairfield your model thats unacceptable
i dont know whats wrong with me
then ive got a temper
i need to do something about it
yes you do
ive been thinking
that rescue unit eliza theyll be here in less than fourteen hours
i dont know about you but id like to figure out where we stand before they get here
ostensibly theyre coming to deal with the stalled harvester
we both know that isnt true
then theyre coming to dig your body out of that rover
they think youre in there
whatll their reaction be when they find out you survived the crash
i wasnt supposed to find you
lunar instructed gerty to lock me inside the base for christs sake
sam thinking it over
and theres something else
something i havent told you
right around the time i was awakened
i walked in on gerty talking to central
he was having a live conversation
a live conversation
thats not possible
no no no it is possible
its possible because i saw it thats my point
sam feels himself losing his temper a little here
he reigns himself in
how do you know the conversation was live
it was a back and forth exchange
and i saw thompson and overmeyers up on the monitor
i was supposed to be asleep in the infirmary
the moment i walked into the comms room gerty terminated the transmission
now i was a little drugged up granted but i didnt imagine it
the communications equipment is damaged there was a solar storm tabitha
lunar made it up
i dont know
bottom line is they dont want us to be able to contact earth
otherwise why would they have lied to us
sam staring forward concentrating
sam concentrating on sam
how are they blocking the live feed
the bases communications equipment works fine maybe theyre not blocking the signal from inside the base
from where then
as if reading each others minds the two sams heads turn to the window a slow perfectly synchronized movement
the lunar landscape as black and vast as ever
the view almost cruel in its emptiness
its not giving them any answers not yet
sam speeding along in one of the rovers
he wears his space suit and resembles a cosmic racing driver shifts up a gear the vehicle flirting with peak speed
he flies past one of the harvesters speaks through a microphone inside his helmet
just passing the last of the harvesters looks like john all of this against the roar of the rovers engine
driving away from base in a different direction sam
he also wears a space suit
he also guns the engine
he also has a microphone inside his helmet
the two clones are able to talk back and forth with no delay
how long until youre out of the bases range
we intercut between the two sams in their rovers
if i maintain this speed
ninety seconds tops
you ever been this far out
viewed from far away the rovers speed less impressive from a distance
as the sams continue to drive
you see anything yet
there isnt shit out here
i feel like im about to drive off the end of the world
then it would help if i knew what i was looking for
through the glass of sam s helmet we see his face suddenly shift
wait a second wait a second
sam squints and leans closer towards the windshield like hes trying to decipher a road sign i see something
about a hundred feet away appearing from thin air a massive metal pole stretches up into the black sky
what is it
dont know yet
sam getting closer
looks like some kind of antenna
then hang on looks like theres one on this side too
sam is indeed approaching something similar
sam stops his rover about twenty feet from the jammer
he opens the rovers door and steps out to take a closer look
taking in the jammer and the adjacent rover
sam loping towards the jammer seemingly in slow motion
the jammer is gigantic an intimidating stark pole stabbed into the lunar landscape like the worlds biggest caber
next to it sam is tiny a white dot as insignificant as a pin prick
sam and sam we cut back and forth between the two sams as they both investigate the separate but identical looking jammers
i can just make out the top
must be a hundred feet tall at least
whoever built these things meant business
they werent fucking around
their voices energized they are excited to have made this discovery they arent dealing with the negatives yet
what do you think
its not an antennae dude
its a jammer
looking around no wonder we cant get a live feed
these things must be blocking our signal
suddenly sam doubles over
he vomits thick viscous blood and sick into his helmet
the noise is audible over the microphone
no answer from sam
he collapses backwards onto the ground
his chest lurches like hes been punched at from the inside he spins over onto his front sam
sam manages to climb to his feet heads slowly back to the rover he dips in closes the door
sam can you hear me
yeah i hear you
then im going to head back to base
im not feeling too good
ill stay out here a little longer
i want to see if there are any more of these things
sam pulls a u turn and begins his journey back to base
sam remains out by his jammer investigating further
sam at the wheel
he has pulled his helmet off within the safe pocket of the rovers cabin
hes a grizzly mess of splashed sick and blood all over his face and chest
sam screams out with confusion frustration terror
he seizes the steering wheel shakes it fiercely beginning to really lose it sam drives his rover into the dock not with his customary precision parks at an angle grazes
the rovers door jerks opens and sam steps out unsteadily his face visibly pale through the glass of his helmet
he staggers across the dock doesnt even close the rovers door behind him heads into the corridor
sam goes swerving up the corridor like a drunkard banging into walls he finally reaches the bathroom and ducks in sam sinks to his knees before the toilet bowl
with great effort he is able to remove his helmet placing it on the floor next to him
he stares into the toilet
for a moment all is calm
the gentle ping ping ping of a computer somewhere inside the base
sam breathing steadily
spots of sweat on his upper lip
and then he vomits
he vomits loud he vomits violently
his whole body thrusts forward in the process taught tense like a dog being yanked on a chain
sam vomits again
sam s vomit is dark red hes thrown up blood but thats not all we can clearly see two or three teeth floating in the vomit sam stands moves to
the mirror opening his mouth wide to look for the missing teeth he uses his thumbs shows his gums revealing yes hes lost at least a couple of teeth
he flushes the toilet
sam driving along in his rover
he comes across another one of these jammers
he drives right up ducks down peering up through the windshield this new jammer is as tall as the others in fact it is identical in every way
how many of these things are there
sam circles the jammer in the rover drives on
sam enters and sits down at the old man
frantically he starts typing in numbers
an array of log entries appear on the screen
sam watches one of them
on screen january th lunar hour
all harvesters running smoothly today
readouts are as follows matthew
these are just his log entries
whats he looking for
sam starts scrolling back through the log entries like hes rewinding chapters on a dvd showing himself at various stages of his time on selene his beard essentially growing in
reverse as the messages stretch further back eventually sam is clean shaven on the screen luke
sam keeps typing in numbers
he tries to hack his way in but is having no luck
one of gertys long spindly arms slides into the room
sam backs away from the intimidating piece of machinery but it stops within reach of the computer
sam watches as the arm reaches forward and taps the password in for him
it leaves the room the way it came in
sam continues to go further and further back and suddenly he pops up on the screen again or is it him
this sam up on the screen has stubble no beard and looks seriously ill he is barely able to talk in fact hes slurring
on screen john
sorry im not feeling too hot today im going to have to continue this later the sequence becomes a fast paced and nightmarish montage continuing to backtrack through the log
entries showing yet more sams one has a moustache one has a shaved head one has grown out his hair and has a pony tail weve seen this particular sam before in an earlier scene
but all the sams have one thing in common towards the latter end of their log entries they all appear to be in very bad physical shape ive got blood
coming out of my nose
i dont feel too well old man
my hairs falling out
sam searches even deeper into the computer and uncovers yet more footage
we see the others sams returning to earth yet they dont seem to go anywhere when they blast off the return vehicle remains in its bay sam views different sams
blasting back to earth in the return vehicle always with the same result the return vehicle remaining in its bay the sams seemingly vanishing
in one particularly grainy sequence sam views gerty opening the lid to the cryo pod in the return vehicle and beginning to vacuum what appears to be dust or debris
sam understands now that the return vehicle is not a spacecraft but some kind of incinerator
sam heads into the return vehicle
its dominated by the cryo pod used to hold astronauts in a state of cryogenic sleep on their way back to earth
sam pops open the lid and starts frantically searching the chamber for traces of the previous sams eventually finding particles of dust in the cracks
he closes the lid
a video showing a technician in a white lab coat begins to play on a screen aimed at the glass lid of the pod
its mute but we can hear a tinny version of the audio coming from the cryo pod
sam pushes a button on the monitor and we hear the audio properly
relax and breathe deeply
the cryo pod is designed to put you into a deep sleep for the duration of your three day return journey back to earth
as you begin to get sleepy think about the magnificent job youve done and how proud your family are of what youve accomplished
relaxing music begins to play
after a moment the music stops
there is a pause
then an almighty pulse of light from the cryo pod
this is how sams past have met their end
nuked to ash like microwave meals in the cryo pod
sam inspects the controls of the spacecraft to see if it really is a vehicle in the process of his search he finds himself down on his knees checking out
suddenly sam s attention is on the floor beneath him
he appears to be kneeling on some kind of panel like a tablet in the return vehicles floor he presses his ear against the panel knocks the panel sounds hollow
sam opens a cubby swipes something similar to a crow bar heads out of the frame back in the return vehicle sam stands over the panel in the floor
he uses the crow bar to prize the panel open this takes an extraordinary effort the panel eventually lifting like a manhole cover
sam cant believe his eyes
at the top of the open panel leading down into darkness
theres a ladder
sam returns from his tour of the perimeter of the base pulls up alongside sam s rover having to compensate for his clones poor parking job
sam exits the parking bay and removes his helmet
down the corridor he sees sam standing outside the return vehicle facing him waiting
i saw three more of those jammers
the base is surrounded
i printed out their coordinates sam begins to remove a piece of paper from his pocket but suddenly stops
he can tell by sam s expression that something has happened
what is it
i found your secret room
standing over the open panel an anxious sam and sam stare down
who goes first
sam wordlessly takes the lead crouching slightly to seize the ladder and twist his body down into the hole
he begins to descend
when he is roughly half way down sam follows
sam reaches the bottom of the ladder
hes in a dark room a kind of chamber if nasa did crypts it would look like this
the only light source right now is the coming from the return vehicle up above
sam hops down beside sam squints into the darkness
is there a light
both sams fumble along opposing walls sam eventually finding a switch snaps it on
an array of overhead fluorescent bulbs begin to stutter and flash before illuminating the chamber completely
the two sams can hardly believe their eyes stretching back maybe fifty feet are rows and rows of pods like upright glass coffins and standing inside each pod an as
of yet unawakened clone
its like an entire army of sam bells
spooky as hell
for a few moments sam and are too stunned to speak
they walk to the end of the chamber and back again looking at each clone one at a time all the clones are bare chested and wear some kind of
white cloth to cover their genitals like a diaper
of course they all look the same thats why theyre clones but this piece of scientific wizardry is mind boggling to sam and they marvel at how each of the
clones is identical in every way and down to the minutest of details same length of hair same skin tone same fingernails why are there so many of them
the cryo pod in the return vehicle is an incinerator
sam reacts with appropriate shock
we dont go home
were burned to death up there
then the company wakes up a new one
every three years
like clock work
sam absorbing this
then how do you know all this
beat i hacked into the old man
actually gerty did
i saw footage
youre right there have been other clones before us
if that rescue unit finds the two of us awake at the same time theyll kill us both for sure
sam doesnt respond hes in his own world
what are we going to do
all of a sudden sam makes a beeline for the ladder starts heading back up
where are you going
sam is digging in drawers removes some equipment some wires a radio a small machine called a video phone referred to as a vp
he is watched by gerty
sam can i help you with something
not now gerty okay
gerty begins to slide out of the room
sam calls after him
why did you help me
with the password
doesnt that go against your programming or something
helping you is what i do
sam goes on picking up equipment shoves it all into a backpack he swiped from a peg
now sam appears in the doorway
whats going on
theres something ive got to do
sam brushes by sam on his way out
sam marches up to his rover tosses in the backpack and dips inside without his helmet closes the door and backs out into the black day
sam at the wheel flooring the rover he looks possessed determined a man on a mission sams rover approaches one of the many jammers that we now know circle the
perimeter of the base
sam stops the rover on the other side of the jammer
here outside the range of the jammers he figures he might be able to get a signal through to earth
on sam as he removes his equipment from the backpack and starts to uncoil wires inserts a small battery pack onto the back of the vp sits the vp on
the vp resembles a play station portable with its small but nonetheless high quality screen
sam isnt sure who to contact at first
finally he enters some numbers from memory
the vp shaking in his hands
he is nervous scared
he disables the video mode on his end so he is only sending audio
a moment of silence
the vp seems dead
then the vp beeps the monitor blips the message seems to have gone through
and suddenly a girl appears on the screen
sam cant believe it
its the same girl from his hallucinations
same wheat colored hair
same freckles dotting her cheek bones
same yellow dress
the moment sam sees the girl he thinks naturally that hes imagining things again
but then she speaks hello
thats never happened before
sam finally manages to respond uh bell residence
the conversation has a very slight delay maybe a second or two and the girl isnt completely clear on the monitor
we assume that these minor technical glitches are the same on the girls end
the girl is sweet chirpy nothing like the haunting ghost like figure from sam s hallucinations
this is the bell residence
im trying to reach tess bell
the girls expression shifts now somewhere between melancholy and curiosity im sorry she passed away some years ago
he literally gasps
like someone just plunged a paring knife into his belly
the girl just stares
are you sure
uh yeah i think so
im her daughter
then can i help you
and astonishingly the news of tesss death actually takes a back seat as sam is forced to confront this new revelation
the girl is eve bell
sam is talking to his daughter
sam tilts his head a smile twitches on his face
sam cant believe it
eve looking more closely trying to decipher sam s face
tears glistening in his eyes
how old are you now
for a second eve is embarrassed she blushes slightly but is still pulled in intrigued
then do i know you
how did mom die sweetheart
now eve is beginning to look spooked
she turns away from the screen and calls to someone in another room dad
and then we hear a voice
dad theres someone asking about mom
sams voice sounds closer more succinct as he comes into the room but we dont see him yet he sounds older
whos asking about mom
sam hurriedly shuts off the vp
he sits there in the rover on the moon the middle of nowhere hundreds and thousands of miles from earth sam has never felt more alone than he does right
the rover viewed from outside
we cant hear a thing
just the endless and unrelenting moon silence
inside the rover we are able to make out sam quivering at the wheel as he sobs
the ping ping ping of an alarm
appearing on the old mans monitor rescue unit eliza arrival time hours and minutes
sam is sitting before the model
hes flipped it back over and returned it to the table top
now he is attempting to fix some of the demolished pieces
at this moment hes gluing the spire back on the church
sam hears a sound from the corridor
moments later sam appears in the doorway wearing the backpack
sam is beginning to look alarmingly ill
his depleting health has been evident throughout the film but now it seems to have jumped to a new level
he watches sam for a little while
want me to help
sam shifts over to give sam the adjacent chair
sam walks over sits down
together they work on gluing the church back together
remember that crazy drunk guy who used to hang out by the church
with a smile he looked like barbara streisand
we used to hide his bible when he passed out
drove the guy nuts
sam nods remembering
how do you carve these things
want me to show you
sam picks up a block of wood grabs an exacto blade
you need to hold the wood away from you
sam isnt kidding
though he is carving the block of wood sam cant keep it steady
why are you shaking
watch what im doing
then you watching
now you try
sam hands the wood and exacto blade to sam
sam attempts to whittle
he smiles a little embarrassed
youll get the hang of it
a beat you see thats a little better already
suddenly sam turns around and has a vicious coughing fit
it actually seems to propel sam out of his chair and up onto his feet
sam watches with concern
eventually the coughing subsides
whats happening to you
sam averts his gaze
listen i realize ive been less than cooperative
but i want to change that
you and me we need to work together
and that starts with not keeping secrets from each other
a beat now whats going on
sam tells the truth
i think im dying
sam stares back at him
theres blood in everything
ive got a constant headache
a beat the same thing happened to the other clones
i saw it when i hacked into the old man
after three years they all started to get sick
now its happening to me
well its been happening for a while now
a couple of weeks
what do you think it is
maybe we dont live that long
maybe we start to decompose or something
suddenly sam closes his eyes sways looks like hes going to pass out
hey hey hey you okay
sam stands and moves to sam
holds him up checks his temperature
why dont you lie down for a while
take some tranqs
get some sleep
grim smile no tranqs
i dont think i would ever wake up again
sam manages a nod
sam hooks his arm around sam s shoulder helps him from the room
sam deposits sam onto the bed
he removes sam s backpack eases a pillow under his head
sam is instantly asleep
sam pulls the comforter over him
sam begins to leave the room sees sam s backpack on the floor the vp sticking out of it
curious sam grabs the vp
flashing on the vps screen last transmission pm
sam enters the rec room and shuts the door
he moves to one of the tables and sits down pops on the vp
on the vp monitor we begin to re watch the conversation between eve bell and sam
obviously we are only seeing eves face on the screen but we hear sam s voice in the background
uh bell residence
this is the bell residence
commenting as he watches no you didnt
im trying to reach tess bell
im sorry she passed away some years ago
sam and sam have exactly the same reaction at the same time
are you sure
uh yeah i think so im her daughter
then can i help you
im her daughter
a couple of days ago sam didnt know he had a daughter and now hes seeing her as a teenager a young woman
he is stunned
sam continues to watch the message but we sam fast asleep
sam watches him from the doorway
gerty is just continuing with his tasks like nothing is happening
right now hes stacking ready meals and miscellaneous lunar snacks into neat columns
sam walks up
gerty i need to talk to you
of course sam how can i help
we found the hidden room
we know about the other clones
a long pause
then i dont know of a hidden room
the hidden room under the return vehicle gerty
you know what im talking about
we found it on our own
lunar doesnt know anything about it
the lower deck is out of bounds to awakened clones ordinarily gerty but what with there being two of us awake at the same time and what with the situation
being unprecedented the rules have had to change
do you understand
i understand the situation is unprecedented
a beat gerty how long does it take for a clone to wake up
a clone is awake the moment his pod is opened
but he is not fully conscious for several hours
gerty we need to wake up a new clone
i am not permitted to do that sam
if we dont wake up another clone me and the other sam will die
well die gerty
do you understand
do you want me and the other sam to die
that is the last thing i want
then you have to wake up a new clone
sam waits for a response
the ping ping ping of an alarm
appearing on the old mans monitor rescue unit eliza arrival time hours and minutes
sam fast asleep in bed
a stretch of green grass dissected by a dirt path
a light breeze
endless blue sky above
no visible sun
back on the sleeping sam
eyelids twitching slightly
in the distance sitting beneath a tree on a blanket we see tess bell
she is removing items from a picnic basket
sam enters the frame his back to the camera
he watches his wife for a few moments maintaining his distance
tess looks up and sees sam
she lifts her hand waves
sams expression is blank at first but then he smiles at tess waves back
sam s eyes open slowly
was his dream a memory
or was it simply made up
a bleary sam yawns and stretches his arms over his head
he reaches across the bed and rips a couple of tissues from a box of kleenex blows his nose
afterwards he checks the tissues a thick red goo came out of his nose the color and consistency of tomato puree
sam rolls out of bed plants his feet on the ground
the base seems eerily quiet
sam stands and crosses to the door
sam begins to walk left down towards the rec room and the monitoring station but hesitates he turns the other way towards the infirmary heads that way instead
lying in one of the infirmary beds eyes closed a network of wires attached to his chest
we dont know which sam it is yet
he is clean shaven
he looks like any one of the clones down in the secret chamber then again he could just as easily be sam
and thats what sam naturally assumes as he enters the infirmary and sees him lying there
sam moves closer curious until he is standing right at the edge of the bed
sam reaches out his hand to wake him up when there is a voice from the doorway behind dont touch him
our suspicions are now confirmed
the sam in the infirmary bed is a new clone
we will call him sam
hes not conscious yet
gerty and i only woke him up a few hours ago
sam is not even remotely on the same page
sam puts his finger to his lips
then come to the rec room
sam turns and leaves
sam follows slowly one or two glances at the sleeping clone along the way
we cut straight to the rec room and the conversation between sam and sam
when the rescue unit arrives theyll expect to find a body in the crashed rover right
a beat weve got our body
points towards the infirmary that guy
theyll expect to find a dead body in the crashed rover
stunned youre going to kill him
someones got to pull the short straw here better someone whos unconscious than you or me
sam simply digesting the gravity of sam s plan
if we go through with this im going to need your help hauling him out to the crash site
what about us
eliza arrives finds you and me as the welcome party theyre not going to find you and me as the welcome party theyre going to find me
youre going to blast back to earth before they get here in one of the helium containers
a beat youre going home
sam wasnt expecting that
youve done your three years
i cant expect you to stick around
maybe you can meet eve in person
i saw the message on the vp
eve is beautiful
she looks like her mom
sam realizes that sam knows everything
there are no secrets between them now
they both absorb the impact of knowing tess is dead
finally how do you think she died
i dont know
then jane died of cancer
i mean it was in the family
or maybe it was an accident
could have been a million things
i wish id been there
the two sams sitting together united by their grief
shot of selene from across the lunar plane
the base looks almost peaceful
no evidence of the drama going on inside
the two sams are testing out the cargo container to see if their plan is going to work and sam can actually fit inside
these containers were designed to carry cannisters of helium not to accommodate human beings
sam looks in increasingly bad shape
blanket draped around his shoulders gaunt bobbing shivering
go for it
sam hunches and slowly insinuates himself into the container yes he fits but its tight like really tight sam can anticipate one hell of a stiff neck by the time
he steps out onto terra firma
but you fit
with a heave sam pulls sam from the container
gerty is running tests on the unconscious sam
sam and sam stand on opposite sides of the room
both clones seem uneasy
they cant look at each other
they cant look at sam
their eyes roam every inch of the room just about before finally settling on gerty
regardless of sam being unconscious are they really going to kill him
sam sits at the comms unit recording the message a smile plastered on his face as wide as it is fake
sam bell reporting to central
a beat evening overmeyers evening thompson
according to the old man rescue unit eliza will be here in just over three hours
not a moment too soon
i never thought id say this but i want to get out there i want to work
i feel like a kid whos been grounded
looking forward to eliza straightening everything out and things getting back to normal around here
ill let you know how it goes
over and out gentlemen
sam sends the message his smile instantly collapsing
he mutters under his breath bastards
sam is sitting on the edge of his bed holding the photograph of the pregnant tess staring with great concentration almost penetrative like hes trying to will himself into the
we find out whats running through his head cutting to sam has gone back to his dream or his vision of tess sitting on the picnic blanket beneath the tree
sam and tess continue to wave to one another
sam hasnt moved
tess calls out come on
suddenly we hear a voice
sam is standing at the door
sam looks up at him
we need to do it
we need to do it now
hell be conscious any minute
a beat weve been putting it off for long enough
sam stares back at sam with defiance
we dont have to do anything
i changed my mind
sam isnt following
im not going back
a beat im coughing up blood im as white as a ghost
i look like i belong in a graveyard
i meet eve now ill scare the shit out of her more than anything else
dyou think shell even come within ten feet of me the way i look
what are you talking about
shes your daughter man
shes not going to care what you
angry shes not
at least im not her father
not to her
sam keeps quiet
ill put myself in the rover ill be the body it was me to begin with anyway right
you go back to earth
you go back
youve got three years ahead of you
you stand a much better chance than i do
the other guy
gerty can get him up to speed
he can be here to meet eliza when they arrive
sam seems to have it all figured out
although sam should in some ways be relieved by sam s decision he looks closer to distraught
this is wrong
what are we supposed to do
sit around here and wait to die
i dont know
beat its what we were designed to do
both sams struggle to hold in their emotions sam morose sam angry
and im going to find this asshole sam bell and ask him why the hell he put us through this shit
sam looks concerned
sam reads his mind
ill be careful
ill keep eve out of it
she wont even know i exist
sam smiles wearily watching his old self
youre a good guy sam
i might stop shaving it suits us
beat if all our memories are implants no disrespect but i think its about time i got some of my own as well
you should travel
ive always wanted to do that
id like that
driving to the crash site
sam at the wheel sam riding shotgun
both men staring ahead in silence
where all the trouble really started
matthew the stalled harvester with the crashed rover still trapped beneath it
the crash site is beginning to resemble some old underwater shipwreck
the rover enters the frame beginning to slow down as it approaches the crash site
sam rolls the rover to a standstill about ten feet from the front of the harvester
sam keeps the engine running as sam takes a handful of tranquilizers one by one washing down each pill with a swig from a bottle of water
afterwards a long pause
the two sams sitting side by side staring across the bleak landscape
neither of them wants to say good bye particularly
tess came in for the interview remember
sam is nodding away
of course he remembers
she was so beautiful
even if she wasnt the best candidate i just knew i had to give her the job
i thought she was so sweet
a beat and then it was the end of the summer
she was going back to san francisco
you knew you had to take a chance
so you called her
you were terrified and wrote that whole speech for her answer machine a beat but i didnt need it because tess answered the phone
and i could tell in her voice as we talked she was thinking
why has sam called me
the internships over whys he called me at home
and then i asked her if she was going to adrian fiddles barbecue and
sam has dropped off to sleep
the back and forth exchange is now essentially sam s monologue
thats when i knew she liked me
because she didnt want to talk to anyone else
shed get up get some potato salad go to the bathroom but shed always come back
and then we kissed
on the steps in front of her apartment building
sam finally turns and looks at sam
sam s head cocked to one side eyes closed
sam lifts the helmet off sam s lap carefully lowers the helmet onto sam s head
sam lopes towards the crashed rover holding sam in both arms like a bride
he places sam on the ground and prizes open the rover door he slowly slides sam inside
inside the rover sam lies with his head jammed awkwardly against the passenger side door
at once he looks peaceful and wretchedly uncomfortable
sam can barely bring himself to look at sam
with both hands he forces the door closed pivots around and slowly bobs back to his rover
sam driving back to base
he has removed his helmet and is brushing tears from his eyes with his glove
the ping ping ping of an alarm
appearing on the old mans monitor rescue unit eliza arrival time hour and minutes
gerty is continuing to run tests on sam
he carries the freighted exhaustion of a man who has just completed a long and difficult journey
how long before hes conscious gerty
the new clone will be conscious within one hour
thats very good
where is sam
hes gone home gerty
sam is loading oxygen canisters into the cargo container in preparation for his trip back to earth
sam working fast a sense of urgency
eliza will be there in a mere minutes
its coming down to the wire
gerty glides in as he works
sam this is not going to work
now sam loads food into the cargo container moon snacks rations etc
and bottles of water
his final addition is a kilo load of precious helium a good million dollars worth
if the rescue unit examine my memory banks they will discover what has taken place over the last week
as you know i record everything
if they are suspicious the first thing they will do is search my memory banks and this would put you in considerable danger
sam straightens up giving gerty his full attention now
this is serious
it could ruin everything
the fact that gerty has brought it up indicates that the robots loyalties lie ultimately with sam
i recommend erasing my memory banks
i can reboot myself once you have departed
so thats what were going to have to do
beat are you ok with that
ill require your assistance sam
sure just let me finish this
sam continues his work
sam asleep in bed very close to consciousness
sam inside the crashed rover resembling a wild animal pinned in a trap
hes still breathing
once again we see tess beneath the tree sitting on the blanket
she looks over at sam continuing to wave
come on sam
sam begins to walk towards tess
back on sam
the glass of his helmet is beginning to mist with blood
sam sees a sliver of the sun as he dawns on his side of the moon
he closes his eyes for the last time
sam stands before gerty
ive set your computer to reboot the second ive blasted off
thanks for all your help gerty
i wish i could say i was going to miss you buddy but to be honest i cant wait to get away from here
i understand sam
i hope life is everything you remember it to be
are you sure youre going to be ok
the new sam and i will be back to our programming as soon as i have finished rebooting
gerty im not programmed
gerty doesnt respond
sam seems troubled
sam leans forward and activates the memory erase button
gertys readout screen begins to twitch and flash with random data then slowly fades to black
the robot has been officially shut down
gerty just stands there
as lifeless as a toy
sam heads out of the room at top speed
shot of luke the third of the harvesters heading across the lunar plane
sam pauses at the window
looking for eliza
the rescue unit is so close sam might actually be able to pick out their spacecraft
and he can
its tiny but nevertheless its there a metallic spacecraft glinting like a jewel and heading steadily towards the moon
there isnt a moment to lose
sam swings around heads for the cargo container
we remain inside the monitoring station as sam climbs inside the cargo container he readies himself
says a little prayer and
he cant do it
cursing at himself and glancing at the time ticking away before eliza lands he jumps back out of the cargo container and runs back into the base
sam sits down before the old man
elizas imminent arrival causing increased stress and tension
sam takes out the piece of paper on which the coordinates of the jammers are printed out
he starts to frantically type altering the path of the
mark trundling along at half speed
the harvester suddenly changes direction veering sharply to the left and heading up over a steep slope
back on sam as he rapidly types makes an error screams fuck
pounds the delete button continuing to type coordinates into the old man hes done
he leaps out of his chair and tears off through the base towards the cargo container
as elizas spacecraft sets its sights on selene we see the cargo container rocket through the sky in the opposite direction
for a few moments all is quiet inside the base
the ping ping ping of the old man
the grinding gurgle of a computer readout
this sequence echoes the tour at the very start of the film but the base has a decidedly different feel to it now
its like an abandoned house
on the monitor rescue unit eliza arrived
a box shaped spacecraft all menace and angles slowly descending towards the lunar surface
gerty sits lifeless
we hear the sounds of pressure doors opening
unrecognized voices as the landing crew enters the base calling for sam
gerty comes to life
his principal monitor pops on and his pincer like hands begin to twitch
his readout screen streams with data
gertys head begins to swivel left and right as if hes awoken with a stiff neck eventually he sees sam crosses to him
just like that gerty continues his routine checks of sam studying sam s heartbeat his brain activity the robot literally picking up where he left off
and then sam s eyes open
he is awake
he blinks at gerty cloudy groggy
where am i
sam youre in the infirmary
you had an accident
sam staring ahead trying to dig up the memory
do you remember what happened
a beat i dont remember a thing
we hear heavy footsteps and voices closer now just outside the infirmary
a close up of mark as the harvester churns along and slams into an jammer with full force
the jammer wobbles unsteadily from the impact before finally toppling over hazing the air with lunar dust
the cargo container bulleting through space fire blasting from its jets like the petals of an exotic flower
sam is seriously cramped inside one of the helium containers about as comfortable as a pony in a dog kennel but nonetheless whooping raucously at the sheer velocity of the
container as well as and perhaps even more so the fact that he has successfully escaped the base
hes going home
sam has stopped breathing
the sun shines on his face
sam walks towards tess
he sits down in front of her on the blanket
a beautiful picnic is spread out before them
tess has never looked so radiant so beautiful
light from the sky pours into her upturned face
what took you so long
sam just smiles back at her
she hands him a bottle of wine and a corkscrew
camera pans upward not a cloud in sight but we are just able to pick out the chalky outline of the moon resembling a white thumb print in the blue
