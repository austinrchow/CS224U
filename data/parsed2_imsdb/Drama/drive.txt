written by hossein amini based on the novel by james sallis
were close on a maze of metal rods tubes and wires
its only as we pull out that we realize its the engine of a car
over the image we hear a voice talking on a phone
hundred thousand streets in this city you dont need to know the route
you give me a time and place i give you a five minute window
those five minutes im yours
whatever goes down im yours
minute either side youre on your own
as the engine ignites and roars to life we dissolve to a map of downtown l
spread out on a bed dozens of different routes marked in pencil
the voice continues one last thing
you wont be able to reach me at this number again
driver hangs up the phone
he folds his map of la and slips it in his duffel bag
a few clothes and other essentials are neatly packed inside
he zips the bag shut and takes one last look at a cheap tv set
on screen a movie is playing
on a radio the la clippers are taking a pounding from the new york knicks
driver strides through a dimly lit car park carrying his duffel bag
a young couple emerge from their car after a late night out
driver lowers his eyes avoiding their gaze as he makes his way towards a sleek s chevelle the clippers knicks game plays on the car radio now
driver is only half listening focused on the road
we see his face in the passing neon lights
feline good looks
impassive blue eyes
something almost melancholy in his unwavering gaze
he drives carefully letting other cars overtake
driver glides into the parking lot of another low rent apartment block
clutching his duffel bag driver heads towards the car park elevator
hurrying out in the opposite direction he sees a pretty girl in her s wearing a waitress outfit
their eyes meet briefly before driver walks on
driver heads down the hallway and unlocks the door to his new apartment
its not all that different from his last one
clean sparse and anonymous
he doesnt even bother to walk in
he tosses his duffel bag inside and locks the door again
drivers back on the road the basketball game still playing on the radio
he drives past a row of brightly lit mexican food shacks on silver lake boulevard and turns into a run down garage lit up with a neon sign shannons picture
car warehouse vintage cars
shannon the owner of the garage has a distinctive limp
driver follows him past rows of vintage cars
plain jane cheap like you asked for but with a hundred and sixty horsepower inside
you get any sleep
not this week
as shannon grins we feel the familiarity between them
i can offer you some halcyon
they head past more cars fords dodges buicks until they arrive at a plain looking impala
there she is
most popular car in the state of california
driver casts his eyes over the unimpressive vehicle then holds out his hand for the keys
the basketball game is approaching the end of the third quarter
drivers behind the wheel of the impala now cruising past rows of dingy toy stores on rd street
he glances at his watch
he checks his mirror then turns into a side street
a vast electronics superstore dominates the deserted street
under the pale yellow glow of the street lamps driver sees signs advertising a huge blow out weekend sale
he pulls over making sure he has a good view of the entrance
on the radio the basketball commentator is getting more excited
this is some comeback from the clippers
only a few minutes ago they looked dead and buried
driver reaches under the seat and pulls out a small handheld scanner
he switches it on tuning it to the right frequency
crackling police dispatches are interspersed with the basketball commentary now
adam what is your current location
repeat what is your current location
another unbelievable three pointer from davis and the clippers are within five
out of the corner of his eye driver sees two men approach
he doesnt react expecting them
they cut through the fence with bolt cutters and approach the main building
driver watches them pull on their masks then one of them takes out a shotgun and blasts the lock to the front door
instantly the alarm shrills
the only thing driver does is to turn on his stop watch
time out knicks
the stop watching keeps ticking away the siren blaring the commentary continuing the police scanner crackling
the storefront is hidden in shadow impossible to tell whats going on inside
driver looks at his stop watch
almost three minutes
one of the masked men emerges now carrying a duffel bag
he hurries over and gets in the back of drivers car without a word
theres no sign of the other robber
the commentary continues so does the crackling on the police scanner
still no sign of the second armed robber
his companion in the back starts to look nervous wondering whats happened to his partner
driver doesnt betray a hint of nerves
four and half minutes on his stop watch
thirty seconds more and hes on his way
suddenly the second robber appears from the shadows running as fast as he can to the getaway car
he jumps into the back seat a few seconds short of five minutes and driver screeches off
driver thunders over the st street bridge towards boyle heights then eases his foot off the gas slowing to a steady speed
in the back seat the two armed robbers rip off their masks looking pumped up with adrenalin
driver studies them in his rear view mirror then swerves right on mission street as his police scanner crackles to life
attention all units
superstore on traction avenue
suspects headed eastbound on st street
driving a silver impala
driver swings sharply into th street now crossing the l
river again heading back in the same direction he came
downtown and boyle heights
all units standby
repeat all units standby
up ahead the lights of downtown l
glitter against the night sky
hovering between the neon green glow of the skyscrapers driver sees the red and white glint of a police helicopter
he switches off his headlights turning left on santa fe avenue
the armed robbers watch in tense silence as driver weaves in and out of the industrial alleyways with his lights switched off
its as if hes trying to find his way out of the maze or probing to see if theres anyone out there
baker headed south on boyle avenue
no sign of suspects
repeat no sign of suspects
the armed robbers look relieved when suddenly a police car glides past at the end of the alleyway its lights also off
its like catching a glimpse of a passing sharks fin
driver taps the brakes gently his car sliding to a stop
he stays there a moment then eases the impala forward turning in the same direction as the black and white
its a high risk strategy but driver follows the black and white at a distance hidden in the darkness knowing other squad cars wont be checking the same route
the police car makes its way through the dimly lit industrial zone unaware its being shadowed
driver turns his car radio up a whisper
and for the first time in the game the clippers have the lead
seven to go in the fourth here at the staples centre
driver turns the sound back down
up ahead the police car swings left disappearing from view
driver slows down too anticipating the next obstacle
he doesnt have long to wait
in the distance he suddenly sees the piercing beam of a police choppers search lights sweeping the area one more time
driver floors the gas speeding straight towards the approaching helicopter
the armed robbers are too stunned to protest
they just sit there watching the sweeping searchlights getting closer and closer
then suddenly it becomes clear what drivers doing
up ahead theres a small underpass below the th street bridge
driver slides the car under the safety of the bridge just before the choppers searchlights spot them
the roar of the helicopter thunders overhead
the underpass is crammed with dirty mattresses and shopping carts
sleeping hobos can be seen under dirty blankets
driver waits for the echo of the helicopter to fade then moves forward again
gloomy yellow street lamps shine down on the industrial zone
rows of delivery trucks are parked outside the meat packing factories
driver cruises cautiously down the deserted street
the crackling of the police scanner and the droning of the basketball commentary add to the tension
finally up ahead he sees car lights streaming back and forth on broadway
the armed robbers lie flat on the back seat paying driver more respect now
theres a steady flow of traffic on broadway
driver falls in behind the other cars
on the radio the basketball game is still playing
three thirteen left on the clock
dunleavy calls a time out and its the clippers by one
the passing head lamps light up drivers face
theres not a trace of emotion in his eyes even when he spots a patrol car approaching in the opposite direction
buckle up your seat belts clippers fans
this game really is too close to call
the two cars pass each other slowly
driver sees the cops in the black and white peering at the impala as they head past
he turns down the basketball game and focuses on the scanner
this is david
silver impala headed south on broadway and pico
couldnt get a look at her license plates
appears to be only one occupant
in the back seat the armed robbers wait nervously for the police dispatch to respond
why dont you check her out
as soon as he hears this driver swerves sharply into the next street
driver guns around the block now building up speed
this is david
we lost the suspect somewhere between broadway and grand
possible evasive action
request airship and additional units
driver bursts out onto pico now
a squad car headed in the opposite direction slows down as it sees him but is caught up in the flow of traffic unable to turn round and give chase
suspect headed west on pico
driver threads his way through the vehicles in front of him so smooth and effortless its hard to tell how fast hes going
he glances up as he hears the dull rumble of a police chopper overhead
the helicopter is almost directly above him swinging its search beam back and forth to get a lock on his position
driver pushes the car as fast as it will go but theres no way of outrunning the chopper
blue light floods the asphalt around him as he guns down figueroa
pursuit in progress
headed north on figueroa
even now driver doesnt panic turning his attention back to the basketball game
thornton pulls up from behind the arc misses
rebound new york
one eighteen to play
driver swerves sharply towards the sparkling lights of the staples centre
the terraced parking lot looms up ahead
a sign above the barrier says season ticket holders only
driver punches in a ticket and roars into the parking lot
the impala screeches from one level to the next
with a game going on the parking lot is almost full
finally driver pulls into a free parking space
thirty seconds remaining and all the knicks have to do is run out the clock
driver glances in his side mirror
behind him dozens of fans are already streaming out into the parking lot before the game is over hoping to avoid the inevitable traffic
gordon back to davis
davis for three
this is unbelievable
the jubilant commentary continues but driver isnt listening anymore
the game has served its purpose
more fans flood into the parking lot
dozens of cars pull out of their places
what a remarkable comeback
outplayed for most of the game the clippers have shown incredible resilience
driver glances at the armed robbers and nods
they climb out of the car merging in with the crowd
driver watches them disappear then slips on a clippers cap climbs out of the impala himself and heads towards another car
outside the parking lot the police are waiting stopping anything that looks like an impala shining their flashlights into the windows
wearing his clippers cap and a clippers sticker on his new car driver calmly drives past them making his getaway
drivers face is fixed ahead sunglasses hiding his eyes
as we pull out we see to our surprise that hes wearing a policemans uniform
its only as we pull out further that we see several other police officers sitting in the same fold up chairs reading car magazines and scripts as theyre powdered by
make up girls and realize were on a movie set
driver glances up from his script and sees another stuntman being fitted with an sfx mask
the stuntman now looks identical to the star of the movie who stands nearby
i need you guys to sign this contract
driver takes the form along with all the other stuntmen and signs it without a glance
shannon is discussing a car stunt with another ad using two toy cars on the hood of a cop car to demonstrate the danger
this is a whole new thing
he taps the fender any faster than fifty not only will she roll shell roll all the way to baja
driver heads off disinterested in the negotiations
a high risk stunt like thats worth at least a thousand five
they wont go higher than a thousand
for all his charm we sense something of the hustler about shannon
driver approaches a buffet table laid out with food
hes about to help himself when jack the caterer stops him
sorry thats for the director
driver sits at the wheel of the black and white while a stunt supervisor checks his harness
shannon leans into the window with a smile
i managed to get them up to five hundred
driver doesnt seem to care focussed on the job
camera ready sound ready
shannon joins the rest of the crew looking on
driver floors the gas screeching out of the alleyway
he swerves between several oil drums then straightens up on the main road
in his rear view mirror he sees a black dodge charger appear on cue bearing down on him
driver slows to forty like hes supposed to but the black charger keeps coming at speed
drivers eyes stay fixed on his rear view mirror judging the other cars speed and angle of approach to perfection
the charger slams into the back of drivers car at sixty miles an hour hitting him just above the left rear wheel
drivers reactions are quick as lightning counter steering as his black and white goes careening off the road
he keeps the car upright long enough to slow it down before it finally flips end over end
up ahead the charger skids to a showy stop
some clapping and cheering breaks out but most the crew couldnt care less returning to their cell phones and shot lists
only shannon seems interested in driver limping over and helping him out of his battered black and white
nice work officer
driver spits out some fake candyglass from the shattered windscreen
a new york style pizza by the slice restaurant
a waiter takes a delivery of chinese food at the door and carries it over to a table where shannon is sitting with an old friend bernie rose
here you go mr
taking out the white boxes egg rolls chicken chow mein five flavor shrimp and peking duck
did they remember the chop sticks
doesnt look like it sir
let me run and get the guy
from the way the waiter hurries off we get a sense of bernies power and authority
he turns back to shannon resuming their conversation
you run a perfectly good business
why would you want to change now
you know how much my business made last year
takes me six months to build a car and a couple of seconds for these jerks to write it off on a stunt that doesnt even make it into the
bernie shakes his head but clearly has a soft spot for shannon
how much do you need
let me talk you through it first
that sounds like a lot
doesnt have to be
the big money teams burn through three four million a year but thats cause theyre using half a dozen test drivers and a stable of cars
i dont know anything about car racing but i assume theres a reason for that
sure but its not the only way
all i need is a hard used stock car
we start off with the small town action then work our way up
theres close to two thousand events out there and once we make the show were talking millions
theres a fortune to be made
well even name the team after you
bernie looks at his friend in mild exasperation then turns away as the waiter returns with a handful of chop sticks
thank you ron
you sure you dont want any of this
bernie waits for the waiter to leave then continues
you still havent given me a number
shannon hesitates but only for a second
four hundred and thirty thousand dollars
bernie rose cant help grinning at his nerve
look i wouldnt come to you unless i was sure about this
come on shannon
how can you be sure
what have you got these big money teams dont have
i got a driver
and they got half a dozen drivers you told me
not like this one
he stares at his friend with quiet conviction
i been working with this guy a long time ive never seen anything like it
i had the money id back him myself
bernie rose considers him quietly
but you dont have the money
everything i own is in metal
i had to sell my bullit car the other day just to pay the gas bill
im telling you bernie put this kid behind a wheel theres nothing he cant do
and what happens to my money if this kid gets hit by a bus
shannons about to reply when theyre interrupted by a big bull of a man with a gruff voice
what are you doing eating chink food in my restaurant
whats a jew doing running a pizzeria
worst fucking pizza in la by the way
how hard is it to bake a loaf of bread
its the fucking water in this city
shannon smiles intimidated by nino giving up his seat respectfully
nino doesnt even acknowledge him
i thought you were supposed to be out of town anyway
well im back
barely a glance at shannon take a hike
i need to talk to my partner
be polite nino
i invited him here
oh im sorry
how you doing shannon
hows the fucking leg
bernie senses things are only going to get worse and dismisses shannon gently
ill think about it but i want to meet your guy first
driver stands in the elevator as it climbs slowly
it reaches the ground floor then the doors slide open
driver finds himself face to face with the pretty girl he saw the other night
she looks a little startled to see him then recovers hi
she joins him in the elevator carrying a grocery bag with some milk and fruit loops cereal
which floor maam
driver presses the fourth floor button even though its already lit
the doors shut and the elevator starts to climb
driver stares out quietly
irene takes a glance at him feeling awkward in the silence
she looks relieved as the elevator doors finally open
driver steps aside to let her out first
driver and irene walk down the corridor in the same direction only a few feet apart
she seems more aware of his presence than he is of hers
she reaches the door to her apartment first
driver looks at her just long enough not to seem impolite then continues down the corridor not even glancing back
in the distance we see a trail of dust moving across the flatland
everything is silent then slowly the hum of an engine rises as the stock car turns towards us
it shimmers in the heat waves the noise of its engine getting louder as it picks up speed
shannon stands with his friend bernie rose at the edge of the makeshift track staring at the glittering car with its colorful signage advertising everything from snickers to cheerios
looks like a chocolate bar
youre gonna have to tell me if thats fast or slow cause i got no idea
shannon smiles to himself
it aint slow
even in the cramped space of the roll cage theres something effortless about the way driver controls the car
his eyes are fixed in concentration his body tensing only slightly as he lifts his foot off the gas and turns the wheel
the glinting vehicle is lost in a cloud of dust then reappears again moving even faster now
the stock cars owner a bearded hot rodder with a t shirt that says drive it like you stole it joins shannon with a confident smile
told you she was a beauty
playing hard to get maybe where you come from
bernie rose pays no attention to their banter his eyes fixed thoughtfully on the stock car as it finally slows to a stop
driver climbs out of the car
as he looks up he sees shannon limping over with the stock cars owner a couple of mechanics and bernie rose
looks a little long in the tooth to me
think we should take her home
shannon grins turning to bernie now
bernie this is the driver i been telling you about
one look at bernie rose and driver senses the power and authority behind his deceptively gentle eyes
bernies thinking of investing in our race team
the old mobster holds out his hand meeting drivers gaze
my hands are a little dirty
so are mine
he gives driver a big grin and a warm handshake sizing him up
driver smiles politely gazing back at him
the stock cars owner interrupts the moment between them holding a stopwatch
couldnt see much wrong with that
you beat the fastest lap by more than half a second
you might wanna take a look at the suspension before we go again
turning back to bernie nice to meet you
bernies still studying him
their eyes stay on each other then driver follows the stock car owner and his mechanics back to the car
bernie rose stares after him quietly thinking to himself
shannon can feel hes getting interested
you gonna give me the four
ill give you three for seventy percent
tinny supermarket music plays in the background
driver walks past the vast selection of instant coffee brands bemused by the choice
suddenly he notices something out of the corner of his eye
at the far end of the aisle his pretty neighbor irene is browsing through the confectionery section
standing next to her is a young boy of six or seven benicio
he grabs a multi pack of snickers and puts it in irenes shopping basket
irene calmly picks it out replaces it on the shelf and takes a single snicker bar for him instead
as driver watches them the boy turns around and notices him
driver heads down another aisle before irene sees him too keeping to himself to himself
driver heads out of the supermarket with a small bag of groceries when he spots irene and benicio again in the car park
irene sits in a battered oldsmobile trying to start the engine
she tries several times then gets out in frustration opening the hood and peering at the engine she has no idea how to fix
benicio peers in too trying to be helpful
driver hesitates all his instincts telling him to continue to his car and drive away but as he feels irenes increasing frustration he cant help himself finally heading over to
irene looks over and sees him coming surprised at first then smiling
we watch from a distance as they talk now
elevator apartment block echo park day
a driver irene and benicio stand in silence in the elevator driver clutching some of irenes grocery bags
driver carries irenes grocery bags into the kitchen for her
where do you want me to put them
just over there
driver places the bags on the kitchen counter
would you like something to drink
a glass of water
she pours him a glass of water and hands it to him
excuse me a second
she walks out of the room leaving driver alone with benicio
the little boy stares at him fixedly
bathroom irenes apartment day
a irene closes the bathroom door behind her looking at herself in the mirror feeling a little uncertain
benicios still staring at driver
feeling a little awkward driver takes a long piece of string from his pocket tugs it gently then holds up two pieces of string
benicio keeps staring at him puzzled by the magic trick
irene walks back into the room smiling
you just move to la
no i been here a while
and before that
here and there
a gentle smile too many questions huh
driver smiles back awkwardly not sure how else to respond
irene switches on the tv for benicio sitting him down on the couch
driver has a sip of water glancing around the room
he notices a few photographs on a side table
most of them are of benicio and irene but one of them shows the little boy standing next to a strikingly handsome latino man
irene turns around and sees him looking at the picture
thats benicios father
driver takes in the significance of this then looks back at her
whats he do
hes in jail
changing the subject what do you do
like a limo driver
no for the movies
you mean all those car chases and stuff
he nods a little embarrassed
isnt that dangerous
he seems thrown by her concern
its just part time
most days i work in a garage
you should tell benicio youre a stunt guy
he interested in that kind of stuff
arent all little boys
she smiles softly and he realizes shes teasing him
mama i dont like this
irene takes the remote and changes the channel for him
driver watches her quietly then drains his glass of water
would you like another glass
i should get going
he catches the disappointment in her eyes but she covers it with another good humored smile
well thank you for your help
thank you for the drink
she takes his empty glass and walks him to the door
passing traffic roars by on the busy street
irene and benicio are walking home from the bus stop chatting happily
they look like theyve just come back from the beach irene carrying a basket full of towels benicio clutching a dusty soccer ball
driver watches them from the window of his apartment blowing gently on a cup of coffee
the reflection of passing neon rolls down the camaros windscreen
drivers cruising down hollywood boulevard shut off from the world outside listening to purple rain
the hookers and hipsters have taken over the streets while up above airbrushed movie stars stare down from their lofty billboards
its early morning and drivers been driving all night unable to sleep
he heads across the parking lot towards a garishly lit mini mall
up ahead a small group of gangbangers are hanging out with intent
they see him coming and look over intimidatingly
drivers only reaction is to bunch his car keys in his hand the longest key sliding between his second and third fingers like a weapon
the gangbangers dont see it but the unflinching look in his eyes unnerves them and they look away letting him pass
jukebox music plays in the bar and grill
driver sits on his own working his way through a plate of bacon and eggs
mind if i cut in
driver looks up and sees a burly redneck with an unkempt beard and a wrestlers physique
the redneck slides into the seat opposite him
youre shannons buddy right
we met last year
you drove me and my brother back from palm springs
driver stares into the rednecks coked up eyes then looks back down at his food
next run we hired another wheelman i spent six months in jail my brother got himself killed
he grins through yellowing teeth he wasnt much mind you just family
driver doesnt seem to hear him
thing is im not interested
driver looks up quietly fixing him with his icy gaze
the rednecks smile slowly fades
he considers his response for a moment then decides against it standing up
well its good to see you again
driver carries on eating as if the man didnt exist
the loud stutter of an unhealthy engine
shannon sits in the second hand race car he bought in montecito revving the engine
sounds like a goddamn m
driver smiles popping the hood
as shannon limps out of the vehicle he sees a battered oldsmobile drive into the forecourt
he takes one look at the owner then runs his hand through his white hair breaking into a friendly smile
gorgeous day just got even nicer
how can i help you maam
ive got a problem with my car
i can imagine
that thing must be older than i am
driver turns around in surprise now recognizing irenes voice
a mischievous smile lights up shannons face as he watches them
you boys and girls know each other
driver ignores the sly look in the old mans eyes
so what seems to be the problem maam
either it doesnt start or it stalls
well why dont we park her over there and take a look
driver is still watching irene quietly
i can come back later if youre busy
hes busy im not
shannon gives driver another sly look as he takes her car keys
the oldsmobiles engine looks like it hasnt been serviced in years
shannon is bent over the hood
just my opinion but i think you should consider buying a new car
with gentle irony that would be great
she glances round and sees benicio standing in the forecourt with driver watching him work on his own car now
drivers so busy tuning the engine he hardly notices the boy
his lack of interest finally gets a rise out of benicio
that thing doesnt work
without looking round you think
benicio watches him sullenly more intrigued than he lets on
get in the car
benicio considers a moment then turns and calls out to irene
mama can i go in the car
irene looks over in surprise not sure what to say
driver and benicio sit in the chevelle driving in silence
your mom said you like movies
ever see the terminator
benicio shakes his head
wanna see where it was shot
shannons got his tool kit out examining the olds
irene looks at the forecourt but theres no sign of driver and her son
how long has he been working for you
dont worry maam your sonll be fine
i didnt mean it like that
shannon smiles to himself sensing her interest in driver
we been together about five years now
he showed up out of the blue one day no references or nothin asking me for a job
i offered him half the wages i normally pay and he didnt even blink
been exploiting him ever since
only thing he knows is cars
the car roars along the drainage canals
in the passenger seat benicio looks tense but exhilarated
the car glides past a landscape of abandoned shopping carts garbage bags and shredded tires picking up speed all the time
drivers parked the car now in an area of the drainage canal which looks like an oasis
he leans against the vehicle soft rock playing on his radio as he watches benicio climb a tree
benicio is asleep in the back of drivers car now
drivers giving him and irene a ride back to their apartment
irene looks at driver waiting for him to say something but he keeps his eyes fixed on the road
cradling the sleeping benicio in his arms driver lays him down on his bed
irene takes off her sons clothes and puts on his pyjamas careful not to wake him
driver slips out of the room uncomfortable with the intimate moment between mother and son
irene walks out of the bedroom smiling at driver gratefully
thank you for today
he had a great time
he stares back at her in the silence both of them looking a little uncertain
im sorry if i put you on the spot you know just showing up like that
their eyes stay on each other the attraction palpable
driver finally breaks the tension making a tentative move towards the door
irene opens it for him looking up into his eyes
driver knows he could kiss her wants to but something inside holds him back
instead he just offers his help
you need a ride anywhere over the weekend im not doing much
dentists north hollywood day
a benicio sits in a dentists chair looking nervous
irene sits beside him mimicking his expression trying to make him relax
irene emerges with benicio from the dentists
the little boy is clutching his mouth making a show of being in pain
irene teases him gently as they walk
driver waits for them in his car watching them quietly
soft rock plays on the car radio
irene sits in the passenger seat with a smile
driver looks at her curiously as he drives no idea why shes grinning
benicio suddenly leans forward and changes the radio to a different station hard rock blaring out
driver lets it go for a moment then changes it back
benicio responds until it becomes a game irene laughing now
the roar of machinery
we see quick shots of drivers day in the garage fixing cars taking out some fruit hes left to ripen in his tool box for lunch working on more engines
at the end of the day driver and shannon examine the stock car
i still cant believe i bought this piece of shit
he grins looking at driver
i thought maybe wed take her for a run thursday or friday
i cant make friday
i told irene id drive her to burbank
youre seeing quite a lot of the young lady
youre taking a long time to fix her car
on the tv a japanese cartoon is playing a masked hero confronting the villains the screen flickering from color to black and white
driver and benicio sit on the couch watching the cartoon
from their relaxed body language its clear some time has passed and they know each other a little better
whats happening now
hes telling him if he doesnt leave the earth alone hell fight him
irene calls out from her bedroom
im almost ready
driver looks back at the screen
werewolves appear now surrounding the hero
looks like hes in trouble
just as the fight begins the color on the tv screen flickers
im gonna show you another trick
benicio watches curiously as driver gets off the couch and kneels beside the tv
this is pretty complicated
driver suddenly gives the tv set a hard smack and the interference stops
think you can remember that
driver smiles back then looks away as he hears the phone ring
irene walks out of her bedroom dressed in her waitresss uniform and answers it
yes this is she
driver sees the look of surprise on irenes face as she listens to the voice on the other end
the doorbell suddenly rings
irene catches drivers eye and asks him to open it
he heads over checks the spy hole then opens the door
a young woman whos sitting for benicio walks in looking at driver curiously
irenes friend heads past driver and scolds benicio affectionately
its not the tv
its a dvd
driver looks back at irene now
she puts down the phone forcing a smile but still looking distracted
irene sits next to driver in the passenger seat staring out of the window at the glittering fountain in echo park
ive never come this way before
its a short cut
the park looks pretty at night
she looks at driver watching him quietly then looks away again
irene takes a long time to answer still staring out of the window
that was my husbands lawyer on the phone
hes getting an early release
she tries to sound casual
driver takes the news quietly even though it hits him like a sledgehammer
im happy for benicio
driver knows shes trying to explain herself but doesnt say anything driving in silence
up ahead the traffic lights turn red and the car slows to a stop
inside the silence is unbearable
irene pauses then looks at driver
hes even more handsome in the shadowy half light something achingly lonely and melancholy about his stillness
she hesitates then moves her hand towards his brushing the back of his hand then slipping her fingers between his
the gesture is tiny but charged with emotion
they both stare out in silence fingers clasped then irene gently withdraws her hand as if nothings happened
outside the lights change to green
the sound of laughter
a sign over the door says welcome home dad
inside the apartment theres a small party going on
irenes husband standard has been released from jail and his friends and family are here to celebrate
holding benicio in his arms he makes a thank you speech to his guests
im touched and grateful that youre all here today even though i know its probably for the food not me
his self deprecating humor gets a chorus of laughter and agreement from the guests
irene is standing next to her friend cindy looking a little uncomfortable
anyhow now that ive completed my mba in catering from chino business school
irene benicio and i are finally going to get our lives back together
he raises his glass to her
id like to thank my wife for being the smartest most beautiful most patient and loyal woman i know
irene stares back at standards handsome face feeling even more uncomfortable
driver lies on his bed gazing up at the ceiling listening to the sound of the party echoing down the corridor
its nighttime and the partys getting louder
standards on the phone to someone trying to hear them over the music
im sorry i cant hear you
he heads into the bedroom to take the call
the voice on the other end is accented and unfriendly
can you hear me now you cunt
standard pauses looking concerned
youre gonna come see me tomorrow you understand
across the crowded room irene is looking for standard
she sees him in the bedroom switching off his phone and heads over
benicio wants you to put him to bed
he gives her a warm smile
who was that on the phone
my parole officer
he thinks he may have found me a job
the noise of the party is finally too much for driver
he gets off the bed and slips on his jacket
irene is finding the party overwhelming too
she heads out into the corridor to have a cigarette when she sees driver across the hallway locking the door to his own apartment
she hesitates then calls out
he turns around and sees her standing there with a smile
im sorry about the noise
i was going to leave a note under your door warning you we were having a party
i wont complain
i wish you would
maybe the copsd show up and send everybody home
their eyes stay on each other the music pounding in the background
the car works great by the way
hasnt stalled once
another awkward silence so much she wants to say but cant
listen if youre hungry we got plenty of suddenly she turns around as she hears her apartment door open
standard stands there with benicio holding a bag of trash
he pauses then smiles
i thought if we emptied the trash everyone would get the message and go home
he grins at his wife then looks over at driver his smile hiding whatever he feels inside
youre the new neighbor right
benicios told me all about you
driver seems unsure how to respond
hes a great kid
i cant take any of the credit
hes got a great mother
standard rests his hand gently on benicios head still staring at driver
he tells me you drive for the movies
must be pretty good
i get by
not like a nine to five gig huh
hes still smiling but theres a slight edge to his voice
irene looks uncomfortable
you want me to take that
no we got it
his eyes are still fixed on driver
you want to come in join us for a drink
ive got some things to do
at this hour of night
standard hes busy
standard doesnt respond still holding drivers gaze
well if were still going by the time youre back you know where we are
its good to meet you
he slips his arm around his son now and continues down the corridor brushing past driver on his way to empty the trash
driver looks at irene then heads off in the same direction as standard and benicio to take the elevator
the two men stand there in charged silence one emptying the trash the other waiting for the elevator only benicio oblivious to the tension
brooding movie stars look down from the billboards
driver is in his car now soft rock playing on the radio
standard is helping his son get ready for school interacting with him affectionately
irene watches them from the doorway looking thoughtful
anonymous streets roll by drivers eyes fixed on the road
standard irene and benicio are having dinner at a chuck e
we still sense the distance between standard and irene but benicio seems completely unaware of it talking excitedly as he eats his pizza
standard reaches out and takes irenes hand gently as he listens to his son
a noise of hammering and drills
the corporate signage has been scraped off the race car and the seats ripped out
bernie rose has bought his partner nino to the garage to take a look at his investment
we paid three hundred fucking grand for this
i paid for it
out of my own pocket
anyway thats just the shell
you start with the shell then you build the frame then the motor
pointing to an engine nearby i paid three hundred for that
the money goes on the inside not the outside
if im gonna blow three hundred i wanna make sure everyone can see it
go waste your money on something else
shannon smiles nervously worried ninos going to sabotage his deal with bernie
pointing to a thunderbird how about that fucking pussy mobile over there
you buy it
shannon sell him the car
at the far end of the garage driver hears them laughing too busy working on his car to pay any attention
shannon opens the door of the thunderbird and invites nino to take a seat
try her out
shes more comfortable than a water bed
i already got a fucking water bed
he sits heavily in the car and starts prodding and pressing all the control buttons as if he wants to break them
what does this fucking thing do
how about this little clit
i dont know whether to fuck it or drive it
fuck it ill drive it
bernie rose shakes his head at his partners foul language then looks away observing driver quietly
driver applies a blow torch to his car so absorbed in his work he doesnt hear bernie rose approach
how you doing
driver hears him and turns off the blow torch standing up respectfully
bernie rose gives him a friendly smile
so whens our first race
you gonna be ready
theres something gently challenging in his gaze
i hope so
dont wanna make promises you cant keep
driver smiles but doesnt respond
bernie rose finds him as hard to talk to as everyone else
across the garage nino sits in the t bird with shannon still fucking with him
bernie watches them
he ever tell you how we met
driver shakes his head
i did some producing back in the s
kind of european
shannon arranged the cars for us and did all the stunts
i knew he was overcharging me but i loved having him around
his next business venture he tried the same thing with some of ninos friends they broke his spine
he never had much luck
hes about to continue when theyre interrupted by a familiar voice
driver turns around and sees irenes husband standard heading towards him with a confident smile
you got a minute
i want to were talking
bernie rose barely raises his voice but its full of quiet menace and authority
standard pauses stung but instinctively senses this is someone you dont mess with
ill wait outside
bernie rose watches him leave with a look of contempt then turns back to driver with a smile resuming their conversation
the reason im telling you this is because hes got a lot invested in you
so do i
their eyes stay on each other with just a hint of tension
anything you need just let me know
bernie rose studies him a moment then finally walks away
driver joins standard in the forecourt of the garage the midday sun blazing down on them
irene told me youd fixed our car
how much do i owe you
dont worry about it
i do worry
i like to pay my debts
driver senses the quiet pride in his voice and lets it go
call it fifty
standard counts out some bills from his tattered wallet his eyes lowered
i was thinking of trading her in for a new car
something fast and cheap
you cant have both
alright then fast
even though he smiles driver senses just a hint of tension on his handsome face
pointing to a car something like that buick over therell cost you nine grand but there isnt much point in a city where you cant drive faster than sixty five
standard considers the car a moment something clearly bothering him then looks back at driver
you must think im an asshole
driver isnt sure what hes getting at
i wouldnt know
well i am
six months inside for holding somebody elses stolen shit
he smiles ironically his gaze still fixed on driver
i appreciate what you did for my family when i was away but i dont plan to fuck up a second time
its a thinly veiled message that hes back and here to stay
driver stares back at him when shannon emerges from the garage with bernie rose and nino calling out
come say goodbye the money people are leaving
driver and standard stare at each other a moment longer then driver breaks off
see you around
driver walks off leaving standard alone with his thoughts
shannon watches standard curiously as driver approaches
who was that
what did i tell you about married women
nino cant resist another dig at shannon
what the fuck do you know about married women
can you for once say something without the word fuck in it
as they continue their banter driver glances at standard
hes walking back to his car dialling someone on his cell phone
passing traffic blurs past
through the windows of a mexican restaurant we see irene at work serving tables in her waitresss uniform
drivers parked across the street watching her from his car
he hesitates conflicted then finally gets out of the car
irene walks out of the kitchen with a tray of food then stops as she sees driver sitting at a booth
she looks surprised to see him but pleased serving her table first then heading over
their eyes stay on each other oblivious to the noise
we havent seen you around in a while
you must have been pretty busy
you look pretty busy yourself
she smiles glancing at the tables shes supposed to serve
what can i get you
i already ate
i just wanted to see how you were
his concern touches her and makes her uncomfortable at the same time
standard thinks he may have found a job so i can give up my night shift
driver stares back at her with his intense gaze
benicio misses you
from the way she says it she could almost be talking about herself
he keeps asking me to invite you for dinner
id like that
his gentle gaze is finally too much for her
she grins excusing herself
i better serve some food
its only when she has her back turned that we see how hard this is for her
driver watches her walk away lost in thought
irene piles some plates of tacos on her tray bracing herself to go back out and face driver but when she finally walks out again hes no longer there
driver leans out of his car window and inserts a key to open the gates of the underground car park
as driver descends into the darkness of the car park he sees a group of shadowy figures walking in the opposite direction heading up the ramp one of them being
pushed in a wheelchair
their leader a large balding man cook glances in drivers direction then looks away
driver cruises past the mysterious group and winds his way further down the car park
suddenly he notices something else in the shadows
a figure lies sprawled against one of the pillars
a smaller figure kneels a few feet away
driver stops his car now climbing out to see whats happened
the prone figure groans in pain
as driver approaches he realizes its standard
his face is covered in blood and he clutches his ribs
the smaller figure is benicio
he stares at his father helplessly then looks up at driver in tears
driver kneels beside standard checking nothings broken
can you move
hes right here
driver glances at benicio
he looks terrified
standard raises his head painfully and looks at his son
its okay benicio
driver watches the boy struggling to hold back his tears
dont say anything to your mother you understand
this is between you and me
benicio nods too choked up to speak
standard turns to driver
can i use your bathroom to clean up
i dont want irene to come home and see me like this
standard is bent over the sink splashing water on his face
as he turns off the tap he notices how neatly drivers laid out his toothbrush shaving cream and razor
he finally turns around and looks at driver
sorry about getting all this blood everywhere
hes still shaken but tries to pass it off with a smile
fucking punks took me by surprise
driver watches him unconvinced
fucking punks didnt look like they needed to
standard looks at him in surprise now
you saw them huh
driver doesnt answer waiting for him to continue
standard hesitates still not sure whether to trust him
you ever been inside
standard takes another glance at the items laid out neatly by the sink
i owed some protection money in the joint
driver begins to see how worried he is
they want twenty thousand
i told them i couldnt pay so they want me to do a job for them
is that why you need a car
standard stares back at him
what did you say you were inside for
a beat then he finally opens up
its a pawn shop in the valley
i tried to back out tonight they said theyd come after irene and benicio next time
driver stares at him in surprise now more concerned than he shows
why dont you take them away
where would i go
irene finds out i fucked up again ill lose everything
he sounds upset angry with himself
this lousy jobs my only way out
driver stares at his battered face and the blood stains on his t shirt then walks out of the bathroom to check on benicio
benicio is watching a baseball game on tv his back to driver
the little boy nods without turning round still frightened by his ordeal
you want something to drink
benicio shakes his head trying to hide his tears
driver heads over then stops as he notices something in benicios hand
the little boy is clutching it as if hes afraid to let go
what have you got there
benicio holds out his hand to reveal a small bullet
driver stares at it then looks at him
who gave you that
one of those men
he told me not to lose it
driver gazes at the little boys frightened face in concern now his eyes faraway thinking to himself
an outdoor food shack in a park
cook the leader of the group of men who beat standard up in the parking lot sits at a table with his girlfriend blanche a stunning blonde with short cropped
ive got you to do this fucking job for me why do i need to pay someone else
standard sits next to driver holding his ground even though hes clearly intimidated by the albanian
ill pay him out of whats left of my share
i cant do something like this on my own
you got blanche
he grins looking at driver now
blanche doesnt even seem to hear them hung over from the previous night
you look like youre hard to work with
not if we understand each other
whats to understand
its my score
either you sign on or you dont
driver stares at him quietly finding it hard to conceal his contempt
thats all i do
blanche gets up from the table before cook can respond
where are you going
theyve forgotten my coke
theyll bring it
his eyes still fixed on driver standard why dont you hire a fucking taxi cab
he didnt mean it like that man
standard looks worried trying to diffuse the tension
so what does he mean
driver looks him calmly in the eye
you tell me where we start where were headed where well be going afterwards
i dont take part i dont carry weapons i drive
standard seems surprised by drivers professional patter
so does cook
even blanche looks interested for once
standard get blanche her coca cola
standard hesitates but has no choice
as he leaves to fetch blanche her drink cook starts to write something down on the palm of his hand
okay heres the deal
this much for blanche this much for that asshole minus what he owes me and this much for you
he holds up the palm of his hand to driver the words fuck off written in marker pen
you still interested
driver looks at him all his instincts telling him to walk away but he stays where he is thinking of irene and benicio
driver stares back at him with his clear blue eyes
we do this job hes paid his debt
you leave him and his family alone
cook looks surprised at first then laughs at his nerve
whatever you say boss
the midday sun beats down on a maze of cars
driver strolls past rows of glittering vehicles until he spots an old model mustang
driver sits at the dinner table with standard irene and benicio now
standards in high spirits beaming at his wife
i was such a jerk the first time we met
were at this party and i see the most beautiful girl i ever laid eyes on and i walk over and say hello miss my names standard guzman
she takes one look at me and asks wheres the deluxe version
it took me like a minute to get it
irene smiles awkwardly glancing at driver
benicio grins eager to please his dad
you dont get it either do you benicio
hope you didnt inherit your papas brains
he ruffles his sons hair then pours himself another shot of tequila
irene notices hes drinking turning to driver
would you like some more chicken
their eyes stay on each as she serves him
standard sees the look between them but his only reaction is to drain his glass and tuck into his food
now this is what i call a deluxe chicken
irene and i are gonna open a restaurant together once i raise the money
thats why shes working in that mexican joint
figure out how its done
shes got more ambition than anyone i know more smarts too
he raises his glass were gonna drive all those fucking mexicans out of business excuse my language benicio
changing the subject hows the movie going
irene looks at standard as he pours himself another drink
dont you think thats enough
come on were celebrating
ive got my family around me and our new friend
he raises his glass to driver now
driver senses how nervous he is about the job ahead and how uncomfortable he is depending on someone his wife clearly admires
are you working on anything else
stop asking the poor guy all these then why dont you go ahead and talk for all of us
all right i will
this time next week im gonna take you and benicio away with me
irene stops and looks at him in surprise
where you wanna go benicio
his quiet confidence concerns her even more
im gonna take you and your mother away from this bullshit city benicio its time for bed your papas got it all figured out benicio you heard me its okay
ill take him
standard gets up from the table lifting benicio up in his arms and carrying him back to his bedroom
driver watches them
even in this kind of mood standards clearly devoted to his son
irene waits until theyre gone then turns back to driver
she hesitates torn then looks up at him again needing to confide in someone
every time he makes that speech about taking me and benicio away from here hes in some kind of trouble
driver sees the deep concern in her eyes and feels even more torn
irene gets up clearing away some plates
driver strides through the parking lot and climbs in his car
driver sits in the car as if its his retreat from the world
he stares out then turns on a stop watch listening to it tick finding his balance again in the familiarity of the ritual
the pawn shop is nothing much to look at from the outside another anonymous la store front
drivers parked the car a hundred yards from the entrance his police scanner crackling
standard sits beside him in the passenger seat looking tense
you dont have to do this
forcing a smile what are you talking about
he tries to make light of it but doesnt sound convincing
out of his window he sees blanche cross the street and enter the pawn shop and looks even more nervous now
irene and benicio think the world of you you know that right
driver glances at him sensing his anxiety
say something happens to me you think you could find a way to take care of them
standards still staring ahead but driver can sense his fear
its not too late
standard considers a moment then shakes his head
i gotta do this for them
he forces a smile slips on his sunglasses then finally opens the door
you got five minutes
ill see you in four
driver watches him cross the street with a strong sense of foreboding
standard enters the pawn shop
driver starts his stopwatch now listening to the seconds tick away
he casts his eyes around the street observing the smallest details the number plates of other vehicles the windows of overlooking buildings
the white hot sun blazes down reflecting on the pawn shop windows hiding everything inside
the police scanner crackles but picks up no activity
driver listens to his stop watch in his own world
he starts the engine and sets off cruising slowly past the pawn shop heading for the corner where he told standard hed be waiting
he pulls over by the curb when suddenly he notices something
parked a hundred yards down the road he sees another vehicle glinting in the sunlight
to the ordinary eye its no different from the other cars parked nearby but to driver it stands out
for one its a chrysler
secondly it has reinforced bumpers and racing tires
drivers stopwatch shows four minutes now
he looks away from the chrysler gazing at the doors of the pawn shop expecting standard and blanche to burst out at any moment
but theres no sign of them
the seconds tick away
driver hesitates all his instincts telling him to drive off but he stays where he is thinking of irene
suddenly he sees standard and blanche emerge from the pawn shop standard clutching a big black gym bag in his hand
he smiles at driver as he approaches when suddenly he hears the crack of gunshots behind him
driver sees the look of panic on his face as he spins around
a guy in a suit strides out of the pawn shop
crouching low in an expert firing position he squeezes off several shots
the force of the bullets sends standard flying
driver sees him hit the sidewalk arterial blood pumping from his neck
blanche screams grabbing the gym bag and leaping into the back seat of the car
driver hesitates takes one last look at standards lifeless body then hits the gas as more gunshots crack behind him
as drivers car roars down the street the chrysler suddenly comes to life pulling out of its parking place
driver glances in his rear view mirror and sees the chrysler on his tail
it doesnt seem to be trying to close the gap just following at a discreet distance
in the back seat blanche zips open the gym bag then stares in shock
christ there wasnt supposed to be this much money
there are literally stacks of hundred dollar bills crammed inside the gym bag
driver catches her reaction in the mirror but his attention is focussed on the chrysler
up ahead at an intersection the lights turn red
driver thinks about running them but decides against it braking sharply
the chrysler draws up beside him its windows glinting in the sunlight
move for chrissakes
driver ignores her still watching the chrysler out of the corner of his eye
the lights change to green but driver doesnt move
nor does the chrysler
behind them other cars start honking their horns
suddenly driver roars off swerving left at speed
the chrysler reacts screeching off in pursuit
driver floors the gas
on speed and power his vehicle may be no match for the chrysler but in traffic the odds are even
he weaves his way past the slower cars putting obstacles between himself and the chrysler
the pursuing car matches him move for move staying on his tail
in the back seat blanche looks terrified buckling herself in
driver swerves left then suddenly makes a hard right onto a deserted canyon road
the mustang somehow manages to make the same turn
it gets close enough to pit driver its nose pressing against the rear corner of drivers vehicle
drivers almost run off the road but manages to save it and regains control of his car
the mustang pulls out wide to build momentum and smash into him
as it moves in to deliver the knockout blow driver pulls the emergency brake and spins degrees causing the mustang to miss and lose control for a brief moment
now the two cars are nose to nose barrelling down the road driver heading in reverse as fast as he can the mustang closing fast
it rams drivers front bumper
the two cars separated for an instant
the mustang guns it ready to smash into driver again
driver clocks an upcoming three way intersection dotted with construction equipment
in a last ditch attempt to evade his pursuer he throws a reverse then incredibly keeps going spinning degrees
the mustang tries to make the same turn but this time the maneuver is beyond his ability
drivers suckered him into a corner he cant control
the mustang crashes into the construction equipment in a sickening crunch of metal on metal
driver guns the motor and speeds away
purple neon spills onto the forecourt of a seedy motel
the black gym bag lies open on a double bed full to the brim with stacks of cash
blanche sits on the bed looking pale
how much did cook tell you you could expect to net
she glances at the bag staring at how much more money there is
driver switches on the cheap tv set with the remote flicking through the news channels
theres no mention of the robbery yet
he zips up the bag and heads out
dont answer the door
blanche nods too shaken to protest
driver hesitates then dials a number on his cell phone
driver hears the tremor in his voice
is your mom there
theres an uncomfortable silence
driver can feel the little boy trying to hold it together
shes talking to the police
irenes apartment echo park day
a in the living room we can see irene sitting on the couch with a male and female police officer looking dazed taking in the news of standards death
driver pauses still on the phone to benicio
tell her ill call later
a soap opera plays on the tv
driver walks back into the motel room
blanche lies on the bed looking more relaxed
driver picks up the remote and flicks through the channels until he finally finds a breaking news story on the robbery
there is a police mug shot of standard on screen
the armed robber was pronounced dead at the scene
he was identified as standard guzman of echo park los angeles
driver listens to the report in silence
blanche seems upset again confronted with the reality of whats happened
other details are unclear but the owner of the pawn shop told reporters that the robber had no accomplices and that the items hed taken had been recovered
in other news
driver switches off the tv staring at the blank screen in surprise
he turns to blanche
the guy saw you grab the money and jump in the car why didnt he say anything
ive no idea
any idea thered be another car waiting
this time she takes a fraction too long to answer
i already told you everything driver suddenly slaps her hard
you just got a little kids father killed
you think i wont hurt you
he raises his hand to slap her again and this time she talks tears welling in her eyes
cook told me another car would hold us up
but he never said anything about this much money or anyone getting killed
driver stares at her quietly beginning to put the pieces together in his head
you were gonna rip us off and split the take
she nods guiltily
how long have you known him
just a couple months
we were fooling around
ive never been mixed up in anything like this you know his real name
he told me it was chris but i just called him cook
youre going to take me to him right now you understand
she nods terrified tears running down her face
can i go wash up
driver nods distractedly his mind racing
blanche heads over to the bathroom
as she disappears inside driver notices something on the bed where shes just been lying
its her cell phone
still flipped open as if shes called someone recently
driver reaches for the cell phone when he notices the silhouette of a man crossing the curtains
the door handle of the motel room starts to turn slowly then suddenly theres the roar of a shotgun from the bathroom
driver reacts in an instant rushing towards the bathroom door
he has to barge it open something obstructing his way
driver almost trips over blanches sprawled body as he bursts through
one quick glance and he knows shes dead half her head blown off
another quick glance and he sees her killer a big burly hitman trying to climb through the same bathroom window where he just shot her
driver moves like lightning grabbing the mans arms before he can get off another shot and pulling him through the window
the hitman lands heavily in a sea of broken glass cutting his forehead open blinded momentarily by the blood in his eyes
driver takes his opportunity and slams the mans face back into the glass strewn floor stunning him for a few more seconds as they struggle
crawling away he grabs the towel rack and pulls the metal bar off the wall
using it as a spear he impales the hitman and grabs his shotgun
in the bedroom the nd hitman finally kicks the door open
driver bursts through the bathroom door at the same time firing the st shooters shotgun
the force of the blast picks up the nd hitman and flings him against the wall like a rag doll
the startling explosion of violence is over just as suddenly as it began
driver slumps to the floor in exhaustion his hand and his arm ripped open by the broken glass
theres blood splatter all over the wall
neon lights from outside flashing on the dead mans face
but no panicked footsteps or sirens yet
driver crawls over to the dead hitman and rifles through his pockets
all he finds are a set of car keys
shannon stands in his office listening silently on the phone looking like hes been punched in the gut
why didnt you tell me
all he hears is silence on the other end
well i guess its done now
he leans back against a car
how bigs the take
one million i guess
he looks dazed by the thought of so much money
you better bring it over
i need a doctor to patch me up
ill take care of it
an underworld doctor doc a shabbily dressed old man who looks well past his prime takes out a small bottle of scotch along with his surgical tools preparing for drivers
shannon watches him uncertainly then heads downstairs as he hears a noise in the garage
shannon arrives downstairs to see driver walking unsteadily towards him in the gloom
shannon cant help glancing at his hands expecting him to be carrying the bag with the money but theres no sign of it
scissoring drivers blood soaked shirt away doc examines the shards of glass embedded in his arm then notices the deep scars running down his back
looks like you got more metal inside you than a ten ton truck
his hand shakes youd be better off with a mechanic not a medic
driver looks up at him warily from shannons pull out bed
just having my fun with you
doc picks up his bottle of scotch from among his bowls of peroxide and betadine takes a drink then offers it to driver
take a hit off that
chances are youll need it
driver shakes his head closing his eyes
shannon watches him quietly concerned for him but also curious about the money
what did you do with the cash
shannon hesitates but cant help himself
you want me to look after it for you
driver doesnt answer gritting his teeth as doc pulls out the largest shard of glass
just think what we could do with all that two guys just tried to kill me for it
i want to find out who it belongs to first
shannon nods coming back down to earth
this guy cook got a real name
ill ask bernie if hes heard of him
driver grimaces again as doc pulls out another shard of glass
i wish youd talked to me first
driver doesnt reply his eyes fixed on the ceiling
lotta guys fall for other mens wives but youre the only one i know robs a joint to make it up to the husband
an elegant apartment full of framed photographs of beautiful grandchildren and movie posters from hollywoods golden age
bernie is in his silk pyjamas looking like hes just woken up
you want some coffee
shannon looks tense but tries to hide it
from next door they can hear the sound of raised voices
bernie rose grabs the tv remote and turns up the volume to drown out his neighbors
theyve been going at it ever since they moved in
shes such a nice lady but its a lousy shidach
its a wonder they havent killed each other
so whats your interest in the seventh heaven
shannon doesnt understand looking confused
its a strip joint on la cienega
your friend cook runs it
whyre you curious about him all of a sudden
even though theyre close shannons wary of giving away too much information
a friend of mine owes him some money
i was wondering if you knew him
yeah i know him
hes a crazy albanian
if i were your friend id pay up
bernie rose pours himself a cup of coffee in the kitchenette
you wake me up this early this friend must be a close friend
hows our car by the way
were all set for next month
and our driver
hes doing great
thats what you should worry about
shannon smiles back but bernie senses how distracted he is
you want my advice
let your friend work it out for himself
dont take pills for other peoples headaches
you got twenty minutes
i need you to run down to the market and get me some milk
sunlight pours through a doorway
driver heads down some stairs passing some half naked strippers at the bar
theres a handful of clients watching a pole dance but otherwise the place is empty
driver turns down a long corridor
a couple of strippers emerge from their changing room surprised to see him but he puts them at ease with a friendly smile
cook moved office again
that one over there
driver smiles gratefully then heads towards an office at the end of the corridor
he knocks on the door
a voice calls back
driver takes a hammer out of his jacket then starts turning the door handle as if he cant get in
its open goddamit
he hears cook striding impatiently towards the door now
he waits then suddenly kicks the door open right in cooks face
before cook can recover driver storms into the office smashing him across the shoulder with the hammer
cook collapses in a heap
drivers about to hit him again when he sees that cooks left hand is broken and there are cuts and bruises on his face
someones clearly given him a beating since the robbery
shouldve figured you for a shill
who were you fronting for
fuck you driver smashes the hammer into cooks right hand now breaking it too
some of the strippers have gathered at the door but driver couldnt care less
whose money am i holding
theyll come get it
you dont know who youre fucking with driver smashes the hammer into the metal plates supporting cooks left hand
he screams like a stuck pig
whos money am i holding
barely able to get the words out fuck you
the strippers look stunned and riveted at the same time
driver bends over cook and rifles through his pockets
finally he finds what hes looking for
cooks cell phone
he scrolls down the call log and finds the same number appearing again and again
the kitchen is busy chefs taking out hot pizzas from the oven and slicing them up in takeaway boxes
in the background we hear the phone ringing
an impeccably dressed man in a tan suit answers the phone
im afraid were closed
could you call back after twelve
driver leans against his car talking on cooks cell phone
i could but your boss wont be happy when he finds out youve kept him waiting
tan suit looks curious now
can i ask what this is about
i have something that belongs to him
and that would be
a million dollars
theres a pause on the other line now
tan suit walks into the dining area
a large bull of a man sits on his own in the empty restaurant with his back to us
its only when he hears tan suit approach and turns around that we realize its nino bernies partner
driver hears a heavy chesty voice come on the line
you have something that fucking belongs to me
the voice is unmistakable
driver stares quietly
seems that way
and youre calling me why
you expect me to buy my fucking stuff back from you
im not selling
i give you a time and place you come collect your stuff
and what do you get out of it
out of it
you put a muzzle on cook forget your zombies at the motel forget we ever had this conversation
ninos thinking to himself looking more concerned than he sounds
your partners happy with that
i dont have partners
you discuss this with anyone else
nino begins to relax now still calculating
youre not very good at this are you
this isnt what i do
ill call again with instructions
driver switches the cell phone off
nino hangs up
behind him we see that tan suit is also in the room waiting for his orders
irene is sitting on the couch next to benicio talking to him gently as he watches tv
ill be back before you go to bed
hows that sound
the little boy nods watching his japanese cartoon
irenes friend cindy is also there gazing at them both in sympathy
irene looks up at her
are you going to be okay
well be fine
irene gets up to leave when the buzzer rings
she walks over and opens the door then stops in surprise
driver stands there
you got a minute
she looks at him in a daze
where have you been
he stares back at her in silence
i tried to reach you
standards been i know
his eyes stay on her as if hes trying to tell her something more
she looks confused staring back at him curiously when a small voice interrupts
driver looks over at the little boy
irene begins to see the guilt in his eyes and slowly it hits her
she stares in disbelief reeling
im sorry about your father
driver keeps staring at the boy but cant find any more words of comfort
irene watches him still stunned
he looks back at her
i cant talk now
i have to go
can i give you a ride
she stares at him in dismay close to tears
the cars working fine
then let me walk you down
she wants to say no but cant
driver and irene head down the long corridor in silence
almost a whisper why
driver misunderstands thinking shes talking about standard
he was into one of the prison gangs for a lot of money
he was trying to protect you
she walks faster now striding towards the elevator
driver follows her
i still have the money
whatever you need she turns around and slaps him hard
what are you a bank
i work for a living
i dont need your widows pension
her eyes well up with tears staring at him in anger and frustration
just tell me one thing
how did he talk you into it
he didnt talk me into anything
ive been doing this my whole life
its what i do
she stares at him in deep disappointment
she turns away when the elevator bell rings
the doors open revealing tan suit
neither driver or irene recognizes him but we do
he smiles pretending to look confused
sorry im supposed to be going down
so are we
she steps into the elevator
driver follows her in
parking lot please
tan suit presses the button and the doors slide shut
driver and irene ride down in silence their eyes fixed on each other
tan suit watches them quietly considering a move but driver glances at him and he smiles biding his time
the lights on the panel descend
the elevator bell finally rings as they reach the lower level
tan suit hesitates but driver waits for him to go out first
he nods goodnight and heads off into the darkness of the parking lot
driver follows irene the two of them heading in the opposite direction
the overhead lights flicker the huge underground car park hidden in shadow
driver walks alongside irene in silence
in the distance tan suits footsteps slowly fade
i want you to come with me
irene cant believe what shes hearing
what are you talking about
you and benicio
shes almost too stunned to speak walking even faster now
i dont even know you you will
once i straighten out this thing im getting out for good
well go some place
anywhere you want
she shakes her head fighting her feelings for him
it doesnt work like that
she stops and looks at him
because people like you never get out
and i dont want my son to grow up like that
she holds his gaze with regret
drivers about to respond when suddenly he catches a fleeting movement out of the corner of his eye
a beat then he suddenly lunges grabbing irene and pulling her to the ground
in the same instant tan suit appears out of the darkness opening fire with his automatic
bullets spark as they hit the concrete floor and the other parked vehicles
driver drags irene behind a car now covering her with his body as tan suit fires another burst
more sparks light up the darkness the bullets penetrating the car with ease narrowly missing driver and irene
driver moves again dragging the terrified irene behind him
tan suit loses sight of them in the darkness striding past rows of parked cars
driver turns to irene as they take cover behind a pillar
she looks terrified not just of tan suit but of him
its as if all her worst fears have been confirmed
driver stares back at her then hears tan suits footsteps approaching
he holds her gaze apologetically then gets to his feet and runs trying to draw tan suits fire
tan suit hears him and opens up again more bullets lighting up the darkness
driver keeps moving
tan suit strides after him reloading when suddenly his gun jams
crouching behind another vehicle driver sees this and takes his chance darting out after his pursuer
tan suit sees him coming and runs the hunter becoming the hunted now
still lying on the ground irene listens to their echoing footsteps
driver runs after tan suit through the darkness gaining all the time
tan suit looks desperate now tiring
he turns to face his pursuer but drivers on him in a flash hurling him against a car
tan suit slams into the car losing his balance
driver grabs him swinging him around smashing him into another car
irenes watching from the shadows stunned by the violence
she picks herself up and runs towards the elevator
driver keeps slamming tan suit against the car beating the resistance out of him
as his body begins to slump driver grabs him by the throat and rams his head into a car window
the glass splinters with blood the force of the blow shattering tan suits skull
driver looks around for irene now and sees her standing in the elevator framed against the light
she stares back at him but makes no attempt to step out
driver stands there his hands covered in tan suits blood
the elevator doors finally close hiding irene from view
la street night
a shannon gets out of his car
driver is waiting for him by his own car silhouetted against the streetlight
shannon stares at him a moment then notices the blood stains on his shirt
a continued a what happened
ninos guys came after me
how did they know about irene
shannon takes a moment to reply looking dazed
i called bernie
i asked if he could help
him and nino are like brothers
i told him you werent interested in the money that you only did it for the girl
from the heart i wanted to make sure once you returned the money that was the end of it
driver doesnt seem to hear him
let me talk to bernie again
they probably didnt listen to him its too late
shannon says nothing now knowing hes right
theyre gonna come after you to find me
you have to leave
shannon takes this in slowly
what are you gonna do
driver doesnt answer but from his silence shannon can guess
how the fuck did this happen
were supposed be in charlotte or daytona drinking champagne out of trophies and getting laid by pit lizards
he stares at driver with quiet regret
bernie rose looks quietly furious
i already gave you my advice
you should have taken your money and left this guy alone
nino and cook sit opposite him both of cooks hands broken now
its not that simple bernie
not now that its bounced up in your face
paolozzi i owe you this guy
just give me the okay and ill you like taking orders go shut the blinds
he looks at cooks broken hands
suns in my eyes
nino doesnt look at cook a clear indication he should do as hes told
cook stands up humiliated and walks over to the windows
bernie rose waits for nino to explain
the money belonged to a half assed wiseguy from philly
i had a tip off he was keeping a million in a pawn shop and was gonna invest it here in la try to run a rival operation
i wanted to teach him a lesson
the lights in the restaurant gradually fade as cook shuts the blinds
you stole from the east coast mob
i stole from a jumped up punk who was gonna step on our business and where did this punk find a million dollars
you ever consider he may have consulted some higher ups
you even bother to check
i dont give a fuck who gave him their blessing
this is my city your city
this is a big city pal and last time i checked we were partners
we are partners then why the fuck didnt you come to me before you set up your dummy robbery or hired this fucking amateur
cook sits back down at the table having closed the blinds
nino looks almost embarrassed for once
this was off to the side bernie
i didnt wanna involve you
well now you fucked up i am involved
anyone finds out you stole from the family theyll kill both of us what family
these fucks still call me a kike to my face
im fifty nine years old they pinch my cheek treat me like a fuckin kid
theyre the reason we left new york in the first place
decrepit old men waving us over to their dinner and domino tables to complain
those old men gave us the funds to move out here
and i made them a lotta money
i made you a lotta money too
he stares at bernie genuinely indignant now
i pay them half of everything i fucking earn and then they set up some fucking kid from philadelphia just because hes a fucking wop
theres a hint of sympathy in bernies eyes
the money always flows up izzy
you know that
he calls nino by his childhood name now emphasizing the fact that theyre both outsiders in this organization
for the first time ninos tough guy act slips and he looks anxious
thats why this driver has to go
him and maybe your friend shannon are the only two people who can tie me to the robbery
what about this prick
he doesnt even bother to look at cook
paolozzi shut up
the two friends stare at each other as if cook didnt exist
are you asking my permission
im asking for your help
i shoulda come to you first bernie
i know that
were a team
he stares at bernie apologetically appealing to their friendship
ill pay you back the three hundred you spent on the race car
its not about the money
he stares out quietly torn
nino nods in gratitude
pass the salt
cook hesitates thinking bernies fucking with him for having two broken hands
he stares back dumbly and its the final straw
bernie suddenly grabs a stainless steel fork and rams it in his eye
as cook screams bernie takes a knife and buries it in his neck
he twists the knife deeper for good measure then with one powerful sweep of his arm clears cook off the table
cooks not dead yet just writhing on the floor choking on his own blood
bernie rose keeps his eyes fixed on nino
your turn to clean up after me
trailer film set san pedro los angeles morning
a the crew are setting up for their first shot of the day
in the background we see a director blocking out an action scene
driver walks past without even a glance heading towards the make up trailer
he opens the door and walks in looking around the trailer until he finds what hes looking for the sfx mask he saw previously on the film set
shannon limps down the steps from his office with a suitcase in his hand
he heads into the main garage then suddenly stops
bernie rose stands beside the stock car waiting for him
all these priceless cars you should get better locks
doors always open to you
bernie rose heads towards him with his hands in his coat pockets
thinking about it
im looking for your driver
you break in like this i figure its bad news
its bad luck
two thousand heists in this city a year he had to pick the wrong one
he tried to put it right
picked the wrong guy for that too
my partners a belligerent asshole with his back against the wall
he stops facing shannon
right now so am i
i dont take care of this im in big trouble
he stares at his old friend
any idea where he is
probably across the border by now
thats where id go
bernie rose smiles not believing a word
he just walked out on you after everything youve done for him took all the money
thats gratitude i guess
bernie rose cant help grinning fond of shannon despite everything
i ever tell you how long izzy and i been friends
since we were six
only jews in a neighborhood of wops
long as i can remember he was getting me into trouble and i was getting him out of scrapes
he looks almost apologetic
anyone else id take your side
anyone else id do the same
bernie rose watches him with a mixture of affection and regret
whats this fucking kid to you anyway
shannon shrugs no idea himself
i leave here without finding out where he is therell be others coming after me
i guarantee theyll be too stupid to figure out you wont talk and drag this out unnecessarily
then im glad you got here first
bernie rose holds his gaze then looks away admiring the shiny stock car
you know its too bad i was getting excited about our race team having my name all over the car
i think we could have made something of this business
nah id have fucked it up too
shannon smiles reconciled with himself
bernie rose grins and extends his hand
they shake hands firmly like old friends when suddenly shannon recoils as if hes been stung
we see now that his shirt sleeve is covered in blood his vein cut all the way from his elbow to his wrist
he looks dazed paralysed with shock
bernie rose holds a razor knife in his hand the blade wet with shannons blood
he takes shannon gently by the arm and sits him down against the boot of the stock car
you wont feel a thing
close your eyes and youll fall asleep
shannon stares out numbly the life ebbing out of him
bernie rose watches him quietly wiping his bloody razor with a handkerchief
bernie roses apartment day
a bernie rose replaces the razor knife in a small lacquered box full of other knives
from next door he can hear his neighbors arguing again
he stands there a moment deflated then suddenly storms towards his front door
corridor bernie roses neighbors apartment day
b a loud knocking
bernie roses neighbor opens his door
bernie rose next apartment over yeah i know
im kind of busy here
theres something threatening in the old mobsters eyes now
the husband moves to close the door but bernie jams it open with his elbow shoves him aside then looks over at the wife
you all right shonda
the woman nods without meeting his eyes
get the hell out of my bernie doesnt give him time to finish clamping a powerful hand on his throat
whats your fucking name
im a patient man lenny not much for getting in other peoples way
what i figure is weve all got our own lives right
and the right to be left alone
so i sit next door for almost a year now listening to what goes down in here and i keep thinking hey theyll work it out
you gonna work it out lenny
b continued b he jerks the husbands neck forward making him nod
youre lucky to have her lucky shes put up with you this long
lucky ive put up with you
she has good reason she loves you
i dont have any reason at all
so stop raising your voice or fucking move
he lets go of the terrified man and storms out again
sunlight glints on the parked vehicles by the curb
driver slows down as he approaches the sign for shannons custom kings glancing out of the window to see if anyones staking out the garage
satisfied theres no one there he drives through
driver pulls open the garage door and sees the rows of vintage cars shimmering in the shafts of sunlight
as he heads past the vehicles he suddenly spots a figure slumped against the stock car
shannons eyes have been closed his head resting gently against the trunk of the car
driver kneels down and lifts him up in his arms holding him for a second then lays him down on the floor
he turns back and opens the car boot now revealing the black gym bag full of money
drivers car roars out of the garage
nino stands in the kitchen wearing a beautiful suit but no shoes or socks listening on his cell phone
we hold on the curious image for a moment then reveal a beautifully dressed woman polishing his shoes
and now we see more of ninos men also smartly dressed and accompanied by gorgeous women getting ready for an event
ninos talking to his wife on the phone
alright honey ill pick you up in an hour
two big lincoln towncars are parked outside
across the road we recognize drivers car
he opens the trunk
when he closes it again we see that hes wearing the eerily convincing sfx mask
he crosses the road entering the pizzeria
several of ninos men look up as driver enters but none of them recognize him
driver stares past them at nino in the kitchen surrounded by more of his men
we feel his mind calculating then he walks out again
nino emerges with his bodyguards now heading towards one of the white lincolns
to one of his men im going to pick up my wife
ill meet you there
across the road driver climbs into his car still wearing the mask
he starts his car setting off after ninos lincoln
driver drifts in behind a couple of other cars keeping them between himself and the lincoln
the sunlight is fading fast
the neon cityscape has come to life and the streets are a sea of glittering lights
the chauffeur checks his mirror as he turns into another street seeing only the anonymous glare of headlights behind him
driver slows down and lets another car turn in front of him keeping it between himself and ninos car
the streets are less crowded in this residential area
as the car in front of driver pulls into its front drive driver takes the next turning making sure the lincoln doesnt spot him
driver cruises along another residential street
at every intersection we glimpse the lincoln heading in the same direction down a parallel street
the lincoln turns back into traffic on san vincente
ninos talking on a cell phone in the back seat
sure carlo ill send him your regards
driver merges in with the traffic weaving between the cars in front of him until he has ninos lincoln back in his sights
the sun has almost set the red backlights of the cars blinking in the fading light
ninos car turns into th street
this time there are no other vehicles turning into the same street
driver has no choice settling in behind the lincoln
the chauffeur glances in his rear view mirror and spots drivers car for the first time
for now he doesnt give it much thought
in the back seat nino finally says goodbye on the phone
nice talking to you too
as he hangs up asshole
both cars head into entrada drive
the chauffeur checks his mirror again and notices drivers car still on his tail
just as a precaution he slows down seeing if the pursuing car will overtake
driver has to decide in an instant whether to take up the invitation
he overtakes the lincoln speeding ahead
ninos chauffeur sees drivers car disappear up ahead relaxing now
driver puts his foot on the gas taking sharp turns on small side streets driving fast around the block until hes back on the lincolns tail keeping a safe distance
ninos chauffeur turns right into the pacific coast highway
driver follows the lincoln at a distance keeping the winding corners of the pch between himself and his prey
from above we see drivers car gliding along the open highway the rising hills on one side the churning ocean on the other no vehicles in sight
in the back seat nino dials another number on his cell phone
bernie its me
the headlights of drivers car sweep ahead of it on the open road
from above it looks like a shark closing in on its prey
bernie rose stands by the window listening to the phone in silence
nino sounds apologetic
look about that thing today
i know how much you liked the guy
in his rear view mirror the chauffeur sees the headlights of the car behind getting closer
driver stares ahead his eyes fixed on the lincolns backlights
bernie rose doesnt speak looking weary
youre the only fucking person in the world i trust
i love you man
bernie shakes his head the same old apologies
in the front seat ninos chauffeur checks his mirror curiously
when this is over ill make it up to you i swear
the lights of the car behind have vanished
even from above we cant see drivers car with its lights off no idea how close it is to ninos car
even though hes still angry bernie cant help forgiving his childhood friend
how many times i heard that before
i lost count suddenly blazing headlights explode to life behind him
driver rams the lincoln at over a hundred miles an hour hitting it just above the left rear wheel
the impact is momentous
the huge continental is lifted up in the air and spun round at the same time
it slams back into the tarmac then flips end over end for a hundred yards
bernie rose is left holding the phone as the line goes dead
the collision has barely knocked driver off course
his car skids to a stop near the overturned wreck
among the carnage we see nino bloodied but still alive
he unbuckles his seat belt and crawls out of the twisted wreck
driver gets out of his car calmly walking over to the pulverized lincoln
he sees nino stumbling off towards the beach but doesnt hurry after him yet
he checks to make sure the other passengers are dead then heads on
nino stumbles through the sand running for his life now
he looks behind him and sees driver calmly pursuing him
he keeps running but hes badly injured slowing all the time
fear clouds reason and he staggers towards the crashing waves
driver slows down as he watches the gangster wade into the ocean a pathetic last attempt to evade him
the crashing waves and the undertow are an impenetrable wall
every time nino tries to wade out further the ocean drags him back
driver stares at his trapped prey
ninos attempts become more and more feeble as the ocean exhausts him and snuffs out any hope of escape
finally he retreats back into the shallow water barely able to keep his footing
he turns around and faces driver the crashing waves still smashing into his back
they stay like that for a moment
gazing at each other
driver silhouetted against the white sand
nino trapped in the ocean
then driver wades out into the water
nino has no fight left in him staring at the masked man
driver stares back at him then grabs him by the throat forcing his head under the water
nino splutters as driver lets him up again
it was bernie
bernie rose killed your friend not me
driver shoves his face back under the water keeping it there until ninos body finally stops thrashing
a phone shrills
bernie rose answers it
bernie rose stares out in silence
whatever he thinks of nino a part of him has died
we feel the regret in his eyes but theres no trace of emotion in his voice
looks like me you and your girlfriend are the only pieces left on the board
driver is no longer wearing a mask framed against the ocean
he catches the veiled threat in bernies words but doesnt respond
id say this has gone far enough
see any reason why it should go on
doesnt have to
then we should talk
you know a place called the great wall out on sherman way
i can find it
bernie pauses staring out
ill see you there at one
a charged silence then the line goes dead
a large chinese restaurant
we follow driver through the crowd
he sees bernie rose sitting at a table on his own pouring himself a glass of wine
the mobsters dressed for the occasion wearing a jacket and tie
he smiles at driver as he sits down
care for a glass
driver doesnt smile gazing back at him across the table
bernie rose doesnt seem to care
i can recommend the duck
hell i can recommend everything walnut prawns shredded beef velvet chicken but the ducks to die for
he delivers the last line with a pointed smile then turns away calling over a waitress
the duck please
he waits for the waitress to leave then turns back to driver
youve been on a roll
cut yourself quite a swath out there
i never asked for any of it
we usually dont
but it comes down on our heads regardless
look at shannon
driver holds his gaze the tension palpable laughter and conversation drifting over from the other tables
anyway its water under the bridge now
question is where does that leave us
thats up to you
you bring the cash
bernie rose studies him quietly
tell me something how does someone with no interest in money get mixed up in a heist
off his silence shannon told me it was because of the girl
driver hesitates betraying a hint of concern
bernie sees it and smiles
nobody else knows about her
you still see her
shes not interested
shes got her head screwed on right
i got two ex wives three kids four grandchildren
not one of them speaks to me now
he smiles again looking into drivers eyes with just a hint of sympathy
this is what ill do for you
you give me the money nobody knows she exists
but its a different matter with you
bernie rose contd these people i have the misfortune to be involved with they dont mind nino being gone but theyll wanna know what happened to him
sounds like we have a problem
and just when we were getting to know each other
their eyes are fixed on each other deadly enemies but kindred spirits of a kind
we shake hands say goodbye its the start of your new life
sooner or later theyll come after you
no end to it
someone gets tired somebody else takes their place
it goes on and on
whatever dreams you have whatever plans you might as well forget em because this is what its gonna be like till the day you die
i just thought you should know
driver stares back at him quietly
what do you suggest i do
first time i heard about you shannon told me you drove
thats a start
he keeps staring at driver then smiles
either that or you choke on the duck
drivers car is parked at the back of the parking lot half hidden by a fenced area for garbage
driver pops the trunk taking out the black gym bag with the cash
bernie rose doesnt even look at it still admiring the car
how much does something like this cost
nine ten thousand
if you can find one that still runs
maybe ill take yours
part of our deal
he grins then holds out his hand for the gym bag
guess we wont be seeing each other again
driver reaches out to give him the bag when suddenly bernies hand snakes out of his pocket twisting a switch blade into drivers gut
he pulls it out ready to stab again but this time driver catches his wrist slowly forcing the knife up to his throat
their eyes are fixed on each other for a moment with something like regret then the blade pierces bernie roses neck sinking deeper and deeper
driver holds the old man in his arms as he dies
they stay like that locked in a fatal embrace then driver lowers bernie rose gently to the ground out of sight
blood seeping through his shirt driver picks up the gym bag and puts it back in the trunk slamming the door shut
were looking down on an enormous parking lot hundreds of different colored vehicles gleaming down below
driver pulls into the lot searching for a place to park
driver climbs out of his car wearing a jacket over his blood soaked shirt
he walks to the back of the car kneels down and hides the keys behind the left rear wheel drops of blood dripping on the tarmac beneath him
he gets up again then sets off through the maze of parked vehicles dialling a number on his cell phone
irene and benicio sit in the park
picking up her phone hello
the blazing sun beats down
driver walks through a long corridor of glinting cars
irene stares in surprise
dont hang up
she says nothing but stays on the line
driver continues painfully through the maze of cars
you got a pen
i need you to write something down
irene looks confused as she hears the quiet urgency in his voice then reaches inside her handbag
sunlight glitters on the roofs of the parked cars dazzling drivers eyes
its the license number for my car
ive left it in a parking lot on the corner of culver and lincoln
irene writes down the details looking even more confused
theres a bag in the trunk with some money
keys are under the left rear wheel
what do you want me to do with it
driver walks with difficulty finding it hard to breathe
its safe to keep it
all around him the chevys dodges and fords glitter in the sunlight
i told you i dont need your money
blood seeps through drivers shirt dripping on the tarmac
irene hears his labored breathing now looking concerned
are you okay
drivers skin looks deathly pale his eyes a haunting shade of blue
he keeps walking through the maze of cars casting his eyes from one vehicle to the next looking for the perfect ride
just out of breath
finally he spots a beautiful white camaro up ahead
howre you doing
for the first time we see the echo park fountain sparkling in the background
im in the park with benicio
irene can no longer hold back her tears heartbroken
driver stops in front of the white camaro unsteady on his feet
i gotta go irene
meeting you was the best thing that ever happened to me
irene smiles sadly
it was nice to meet you too
from above we see the maze of vehicles stretching out forever chevys chryslers fords the history of america on wheels
driver switches off his cell phone reluctantly then heads towards the camaro
driver climbs into the front seat of the camaro catching his breath
he sits there a moment sheltering from the world outside then pulls out a pocket knife opening the blades until he finds the screwdriver
he starts with the left side of the steering column then gets to work on the section below the turn signal
his face shows the strain but his fingers are as steady as ever
a master at work
finally he breaks into the ignition device leaning back in the seat to take a rest
were gazing down at the white camaro from above waiting for it to move
drivers face is completely still now
so are his eyes
he looks almost at peace
theres a long pause then slowly he leans forward and turns on the ignition
as the engine comes to life we cut to black
