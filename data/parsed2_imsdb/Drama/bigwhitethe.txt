written by collin friesen a police car nothing more than a speck on the landscape is intermittently visible through the blowing snow
a corporal s behind the wheel with a bored detective boyle s at his side
so his hand is like off right
so he puts on a tourniquet puts the hand in his pocket walks five miles through the bush til he gets to the highway where he passes out on the
then this logging truck comes along
looking ahead hey
the corporal looks forward
cars pov through the windshield of a woman s dressed in her pajamas and a parka skipping down the middle of the road
the police car pulls to a stop just as the woman does a pirouette and falls over backwards
detective boyle and the other cop get out and walk over
into his radio dispatch this is unit we need a first responsder cancel that
the woman kicks up a leg wiggles her foot
detective boyle contd i know where she belongs
as they lift her up
the dumpster lid opens on a bitterly cold gray winters day in an alaskan city
a chunky shivering hair stylist with jet black bangs shakes out a box of conditioning samples
to someone o
she says i havent eaten all day then right there on the bus she pulls out this like salmon steak and im
the dumpster lid bangs shut reopens a beat later
a moment of calm until two garbage bags slam against the inside of the lid
it falls shut with a clang
the lid reopens
night time now as a street lamp buzzes to life
a middle aged man in work clothes checks to make sure hes alone
he gently lowers the lid opens it again a moment later this time balancing a mini bar fridge on his shoulder
he dumps the appliance into the bin and runs off
the lid reopens
sirens off in the distance
one two three
the lifeless body of a fair sized man comes crashing into the garbage
a man seen only in silhouette leans in to pull some garbage over the corpse
a second man looks in then pulls the first man away
well get him later
the lid drops
the dumpster reopens
a korean american teenager wearing an apron and headphones sings along to an old kiss tune as he deposits two large orange garbage bags
get up everybodys gonna move their feet get down everybodys gonna leave their seat
gonna lose your mind in
he shuts the lid with care
a cookie cutter subdivision
old pine trees poke through the snow cover that blankets the neighborhood
howard s a burly outdoors type is trying to unload a new snowmobile from the back of his pickup
ted watters late s half hidden under a heavy dress coat walks down the street
he stops by howards driveway
need a hand
could ya grab me those two by eights
ted walks up the driveway grabs the wood slats makes a ramp by leaning them against the rear bumper
howard contd thanks
howard maneuvers the snowmobile down the ramp his back turned toward ted who has taken out a small cam corder and is taping howard
howard contd i tell ya it may look fast but it sure aint light
you the guy who just moved in to the stevens old house
hey ted im howard
what is that an arctic cat
what do those go for
howard finally has the snowmobile on the ground
hes breathing heavy as he pulls off his mitt to shake hands
more than i could normally afford ill tell ya
seeing the camera hey
what do you think youre you doing
as ted and howard continue to talk we pull back to reveal we are watching teds video playing on a vcr that is a group of office workers look on
very much impressed as a stunned howard stares at the camera
howard you seem like a reasonable kind of guy
lets you and me talk
tight on watters at his nearby cubicle typing frenetically on his computer
at first he appears to be working until we realize that on his computer screen pixilated zombies die in silent anguish beneath an unholy hail of bullets
a miami dolphins sticker is the sole cubicle decoration
as the tape finishes a smattering of applause from his colleagues
ted gives a small wave over the cubicle wall
ted contd thank you
just happy to give something back to liberty capital
to himself bitter after all theyve done for me
cam s native american alaskan walks over
ted immediately hits a key that turns the screen to a spread sheet
that was really cool
it was like
he was pretty spry for a man with a herniated disc
you know i dont want to bitch or anything but you were supposed to take me along on that one
couldnt find you
i know you know this but the sooner they think i can handle calls on my own the sooner theyll kick you back down south
ive been hearing that for months and six days cam
after a while it gets a little old
off cams look next time okay
cam moves off
back to the zombie blood bath
the phone rings
ted picks up his eyes never wavering from the gore intensive computer game
ted contd claims ted watters
a final key stroke separates one last zombie from its entrails
we pull back to see the walls lined with souvenirs of a life spent on the edge of the wilderness citations from the rotarians pictures of sponsored hockey teams
we are frank branch s a mid level management type sits across from paul barnell s a mild mannered everyman wrapped in a cheap suit
paul takes in the display
the two men sit in silence smiling politely at one another
quite the fish
branch is about to answer when ted enters with a slim file
paul barnell ted watters
paul makes steady eye contact
branch contd mr
barnell wants to talk to us about his brothers life insurance policy
ted sits and flips open the file
raymond isnt it
you see as ive already explained to mr
branch hes been gone for five years now and i thought it might be time to
by move on you mean
cash in raymonds policy
ted smiles to himself
i just thought well its pretty unlikely hes still alive
my dad always wanted us to be able to look after each other if anything should ever happen
and to be frank moneys a little i understand mr
barnell but heres the thing
with no actual body under alaskan statutes a person must be missing for seven years before he or she can be legally declared dead and thats not withstanding an investigation
period where concerned parties can take up to another year to file interventions concerning the motion
so even though your brothers status is undetermined at this point theres really very little we can do for you
ted flips the file shut
branch not entirely happy with teds demeanor forces a smile
of course we are extremely sorry for your loss
branch looks at ted
ted turns to paul
the city skyline rises in the distance as heat vents belch steam against the rapidly setting sun
but thats miles away
here on the outskirts is a rapidly failing five store strip mall a porn a copia xxx video store hair stylist small engine repair shop fish and chips joint and
the barnell great escapes travel agency
we might notice a big trash dumpster in the corner
pauls car a ford taurus pulls onto the parking pad
paul driving talking on his cell phone and balancing a big non spill metallic travel coffee mug at the same time
hang on hang on
first off how did you get my cell number
beat because its for mechanical and medical emergencies only
paul wound up taps his brakes too hard
his mug falls the lid pops and the coffee proceeds to soak a stack of papers
paul contd great
back into phone no im not
give me a second here
paul parks his car gathers the soggy papers and gets out
paul still on the phone carries the papers to the dumpster
yes and that check went out a week ago
i watched my secretary write it up
paul opens the lid
the phone is cradled in his neck he checks each soggy page to make sure hes not tossing anything important
well i dont know
i i i have no clue
could it possibly be a problem on your end
so the electric company never makes a
look i pay my bills
im a rotarian for goodness paul looks over to see some men from rodneys repo ranch walking up to the front door of his office
distracted for a moment the phone slips and falls into the trash
paul muttering leans in to get it
he pushes aside an orange garbage bag guided by the faint sound of the other person still talking
and then pauls pov of the body a ish white well a little blue male dressed in a cheap suit
pauls phone lies across the corpses mouth like the dead guy is talking
a shout as paul jumps back from the dumpster
the lid crashes down as he scrambles slides away
he takes a moment to compose himself then realizes his phone is still in there
he opens the dumpster lid and very quickly reaches in grabs his cell and hurries off
the lid crashes shut
into the phone hello
paul dials looks back at the dumpster thinks for a second then hits end
he stands there thinking
paul back in his office staring out the window with a perfect view of the dumpster
he cant take his eyes off it
behind him the repo men are picking up a newish computer monitor and walking toward the door
at the sound of a truck his head snaps around
its a garbage truck but instead of heading to the dumpster it rumbles past on the road
thats all it takes
paul backs his ford taurus up to the dumpster pops the trunk checks to make sure hes alone then steps up on the rear bumper opens the lid and clambers
the fridge door opens the light revealing several cans of pop and beer in the foreground
behind the beverages a garage where paul struggles with the lifeless body
he props the man against the hood of his car gives him a quick once over pockets obvious wounds
paul moves to the fridge starts to pull things out
jodie an annoyingly small dog enters the garage from the house and starts sniffing around the body
a new chew toy
at the sound jodie no
not for dogs
he shoos the dog back into the house
paul moves back to the fridge opens the door and with great effort picks up the dead man and tries to stuff him inside
the mans legs dont want to fit
paul leans down and grabs an uncooperative appendage
he grits his teeth looks away as he kicks at the knee
it snaps sideways
paul fights nausea
but with the leg now out of joint the man fits
paul breathing heavy leans against the door
paul contd ok then
he packs in the remaining space with beer and pop bottles
then just before he shuts the door paul reaches in and sets the fridge temperature from to the coldest setting
a padlock and chain come from the base of a propane bbq
it goes around the fridge the lock snaps it in place
paul spots some leftover drink cans
he kicks them to the corner and walks into the house trying to sound casual
paul contd hey honey
ted drives home through a wooded section of town
ted checks out various radio stations hating everything
he lands on one playing escape the pina colada song when he looks up and suddenly jams on the brakes
ted car slides toward a moose that has wandered into the middle of the road
the car stops about five feet away
the moose looks at ted
ted looks back wondering what he ever did to deserve the life hes stuck with
after a moment the moose lumbers off
ted drives on
tight on a computer screen where swirling signs of the zodiac act as a screen saver
pull back to reveal we are a telephone cord runs from the computer to the headset of tiffany s pert smart and dressed in a tight university of alaska t
tiffany sits with her feet up on the desk as she flips through a copy of cosmo
its a medium sized apartment littered with guy stuff although bowing to advancing signs of feminine influence
the phone rings
tiffany hits the space bar
the callers number flashes on screen
by the second ring an electronic timer kicks in and a complete file on the caller appears with name address background pets
she smiles hits enter
into her headset psychic pals
how are you today
pause she listens well we are all registered psychics here
i just had a feeling youd be calling
a key in the door
a tired ted walks inside
tiffany looks up then holds up a file folder with the words working shhhhhh
in big black letters
to caller your tv remote control
ted sighs gives her a quick peck on the cheek as he wrestles off his winter gear and heads to the kitchen
tiffany contd i need you to clear your mind
ted looks into the fridge making up new words to the song escape
if you like frozen enchiladas getting caught in the rain
if youre not into
ted pulls out some tupperware tries to figure out whats in it
tiffany still wearing her headset appears behind him grabs a diet coke from the fridge and kisses him on the cheek
im not sure its still good
arent you with a customer
ted grabs a fork takes the pot and sits at the table
tiffany goes back to her desk and flips through her magazine
through a mouthful of food so
hows the tea leaf business today
ive decided from now on to ignore you when youre ignorant about my work
and its going very well thank you
reconnecting to the caller mr
williams im seeing sofa cushions
do you have a sofa
glad i could help
you here from that software distributor guy
no but i did crack that code problem
you know how sometimes when youre running beta versions you english please
there was a boo boo but i fixed it
another call comes in psychic pals how are you today carol
now i thought wed agreed god is everywhere but not specifically in your coffee pot
do i tell you how to do your job
kind of no but then again im not a computer aided pseudo psychic so if youre looking for moral equivalence
before you say anything else that may keep us from having sex ever again let me ask you something
she picks up her magazine
i always get these wrong
thats why we keep trying
now love is sacrifice test
reading if you were in a life raft with me and there was only enough water dont you have a customer
to the caller carol
god says hes busy with a famine right now but you should keep praying
she hangs up
turns back to ted about to pick up where she left off
im not doing it
its just a stupid quiz
the phone rings
tiffany bolts to her desk sits spins in her chair as she answers the call
is this the first time youve called us mrs
tiffany at her computer enters the name margaret barnell into her database
tiffany works a mute button as she points back to the magazine
tiffany contd but stupid quizzes can be illustrative of potential relationship problems
to her caller margaret im getting the feeling this is an anxious day for you
ted cooking pot in hand walks over to her desk
our only relationship problem is youre running a
a minute carny scam out of my living room
dont call it a scam
to the caller startled excuse me
youve got to learn to channel that rage margaret
to ted playful you didnt just call this your living room did you
i meant ours
ours ours ours
tiffany returns to her call but keeps looking at ted
i feel someone you really care about maybe even the love of your life is being a real pain
now i need you to concentrate
ted pretends to do just that drawing a giggle from tiffany before he walks off
paul tries to open the front door but finds it blocked by a small pile of snow
three good yanks and it finally opens
he enters the shop
faded travel posters cover the walls
avis s a career office gal smiles at her boss as she assembles a life size stand up cardboard display for aloha airlines
it features a dark hawaiian beauty holding a softball sized sea shell
the shell juts out of the display giving it a d quality
paul shivering hangs up his coat as avis picks up a promotional aloha air surfboard the old display and walks it to the back
paul contd was november this bad last year
well if we didnt have the weather what would we talk about
did you send the computer back
paul moves to his desk
yeah it was not working
just that fellow from municipal power and electric
i told him you sent the check in weeks ago but some people dont like to listen
paul turns to look at the snow covered empty parking lot then at a photo of his wife margaret on his desk
he mentally gathers himself
strange happened last night avis
what was that
you ever meet my brother raymond
the one who went missing
well anyway last night theres a knock on the door and theres raymond just
standing there on the doorstep
avis arrives with the coffee and the mail
didnt you have him declared
i mean they said he hadnt been gone long enough
smiling warmly good thing in hindsight
paul puts the mail down on the desk and start to flip through it
lots of bills most marked past due
he finds a pre approved credit card application sets it to one side
avis contd so where was he all these years
said he wanted to get away from the cold
looking up sorry what was that
where was he living
paul a flash of panic looks over at the hawaii display
he keys on the shell
ive got an aunt down there
blanking a uh
by the beach
well thats great
you and mrs
barnell will have some company for a bit i guess
how is she
better a little better
some days are better than others
margaret barnell early s stands in a plush bathrobe and slippers
despite her casual attire she is immaculately made up as she walks to the front door opening it on a young wholesome paperboy smiling through the cold
daniel you pussy little cocksucker
ill get my purse
the paperboy unfazed smiles as margaret walks off
i missed you last time
ok jerk off uhhuh
margaret gives the paperboy his money the stamp card plus a dollar tip then tweaks his nose
margaret contd you say hi to your slut mom for me
he trots down the walk as margaret shuts the door
the lid opens
gary and jimbo s check to insure theyre not being watched
gary slightly effeminate leans into the bin and burrows through the garbage
jimbo a bear of man keeps watch
hes nervous a little out of sorts
i thought stuff didnt smell when it was frozen
i dont know why we have to dave wants visual confirmation he gets visual confirmation
we have a chance to move up here so lets just like the guys not gonna end up in a land fill anyway
you ever ask dave what he did
whatever it was he told him if he did it again hed snap his neck
smiling whoops he did it again
off jimbo not getting it the song
from that girl
gary humming now keeps digging finding nothing
gary contd so howd it feel
i mean not when you did it but like now
i dont want to talk about it
gary hops inside as his actions become more frantic
still no luck
jimbo glares at his partner
gary contd serious
maybe he wasnt
dont even joke
maybe the trash was emptied
looks pretty full
ducking down theres a little fridge down here
standing if we would have shot him at least wed know for sure
i was following orders
and if you hadnt started a screaming match no one would have called the cops and we wouldnt have had to dump his fine
im just saying
maybe you didnt break it all the way
walking away it was broken
im just saying
maybe it was like hypothermia and he just looked dead
it was broken
gary embarrassed digs in the trash with his feet
margaret still in her bathrobe walks to the fridge
as she puts her hand on the latch she notices the pile of pop cans on the floor
she tugs on the door
it opens just a crack before the chain stops it
the frozen head peeks through the slight gap
margaret sighs tries to push the fridge door closed but the body is in the way
she gives the door a hip check
the door latches shut while something frozen and brittle inside cracks
margaret oblivious walks away
a chicken sits in a pan the rest of the room visible behind it through the oven door window
why is the fridge in the garage chained shut
hows my angel tonight
dinners almost ready
you feel like some wine
i feel like some wine
paul walks to the oven opens the door and pats the chicken
sweetie heres a crazy thought
i dont feel like chicken tonight why dont we order in
fuck it okay
theres actually something we need to talk about
its about raymond
paul smiles bravely as he shuts the oven door
behind the chicken margaret doesnt look happy as paul starts to explain
she rushes from the room
home video of raymond then early s fat physically imposing and the only person not in festive tropical gear standing in a vfw hall decorated in a caribbean theme
he is definitely not the same person paul has cooling in the fridge
a large banner behind him proclaims happy th anniversary a little drunk okay i never thought it would last this long but seeing as how it has
there ya go
let me just say that my brother old puddles mcbarnesy did better than he should have
a younger somewhat tipsy paul comes into frame puts an arm around his brother and smiles
whatcha saying there raymond
whacha saying bout me
raymond shakes his brothers arm off his shoulder
sing songy rays a little jeallllllllous
this is the one that got away right ray
the crowd laughs as paul reaches over and musses up his brothers hair
raymond furious grabs his brother by the lapels and throws him roughly to the floor
the laughter stops
leave him alone ball licker
and shut that thing the screen turns to snow
paul at his desk watching the video on a small tv in the wall unit
he turns his attention to a large cardboard box filled with documents souvenirs old report cards
on the tv playing behind him the second part of the tape margaret is pictured on a cruise ship sunning herself
paul obviously behind the camera watches as margaret takes a tropical drink from a waiters tray who promptly dumps it all over her
but instead of the expected burst of profanity margaret just thats okay dont worry about it
as the waiter walks off id like the next one in a cup please
paul puts aside a faded hotel postcard from hawaii and digs out an insurance policy out of the box
on the last page is a list of the payouts
loss of a limb
loss of thumb
and as an extra bonus raymonds birth certificate
paul takes out the credit card application from work and starts to write
to himself raymond
laughing children on toboggans inner tubes and discarded cardboard boxes slide down a snow covered hill against a slate gray sky
its an isolated area on the outskirts of the city
gary and jimbo sit in their car in the parking area
which ones your sisters kid
see the one on the little bike thing
hesitant you been alright with this
the thing with the guy
ya know i thought it might kinda mess me up
first time for both of us
but ive been sleeping really well
course you didnt actually
jimbo mimics snapping someones neck
its clearly not a gesture he enjoys
as gary looks at him a cadillac pulls up beside them
behind the wheel is dave s well dressed in a thuggish kinda way
jimbo and gary share a nervous look
about yards away from the two cars garys nephew is having his snowrider a tricycle with skis instead of wheels hijacked by a playground bully in a red parka
a tug o war for the toy ensues as gary and jimbo get out of their car
gary and jimbo are leaning close to the cadillacs open window
dave does not look happy
to jimbo wait a minute
gary waves to his nephew
shouting you just
hang in there billy
but hes dead
i mean that part no question
take off your coat
and your shirt too
jimbo knows better than to argue
he strips down exposing his corpulent middle aged belly to the chilly winter winds
im not wearing a wire dave if thats what this is about
it was our first time
no one gets it perfect their first time
you too sweetie
gary is about to comply when the sound of a fight on the tobogganing hill causes them all to look over just in time to see garys nephew shoved to
the bully laughs as he slides away
excuse me for a second
gary trots toward the hill
jimbo cant believe it
were in the middle of something
calling back hey im supposed to be looking after him
jimbo turns back to dave shrugging sheepishly
look we can take you there right now
well show you
behind them on the hill gary tries to retrieve his nephews snowrider from the bully
he is failing
show me what
an empty trash dumpster
it was supposed to look like an accident
i was hoping to see it in the paper
so help me if this guy pops up somewhere
while jimbo does his best to stay warm behind him on the hill gary can only watch as the bully slides away
echoing in the cold fag
hes proof jimbo
i like to know my moneys well spent
you got a week
dave drives off as gary walks over with his sniffling nephew
slippery little sucker
you mind if we stop at a toy store on the way back
high angle on paul and margaret in bed
margaret takes up more than her share of the bed her arm tossed over her husband
paul on his third of the bed looks as if hes lying in state
but pauls not sleeping
a newspaper clears the for sale price reduced
sign on the front lawn and lands with a thud on the steps
paul has the morning news on the hood of his car
he looks over at the fridge still padlocked
to himself lets see if anyones missing you
he flips through each section
paul walks to the fridge
paul contd to the corpse i dont know what kind of man lets himself just freeze to death in the trash but i was never one to preach
way i see it youve probably got family somewhere and theyd probably appreciate seeing you get a decent funeral even if its not really
paul somewhat befuddled gently pats the fridge door
margaret pushes the vacuum across the floor humming to herself
paul walks by slipping into his coat
he notices that the vacuum isnt plugged in
without missing a beat he walks over and plugs it into the outlet
the vacuum roars to life
margaret doesnt flinch
paul heads out the door
a ways out in the forest
only two houses on this turn out a cozy looking lived in cabin sits up the road from a seemingly deserted rundown mobile home
a car pulls up
paul adjusts a pillow he has taped to his stomach then pulls on a blue ski mask
paul undoes the bungee cord and drags his snowblower out of the trunk
he fires up the snowblower and starts to plow the drive way of both houses
wherry s in her bathrobe looks out the window of the cozy cabin
a tad confused she waves to the man in the blue parka
the blue parka waves back
paul walks in from the garage pulling off his blue parka
margaret enters from the living room
paul still has the pillow taped to his front which margaret happily pokes with a finger but never mentions
nervous hes not here is he
sweetie dont you worry about raymond
when hes around it just brings back
he he said hes probably gonna head back down south soon
margaret smiles relieved
the phone rings
paul picks up
wherry talks on the phone in her kitchen
the head of a large antelope is mounted on the wall behind her
thank you so much for clearing the drive way
that was most considerate
im afraid i dont understand mrs
you were out at the cabin this morning
nice to see you getting some use out of that thing
paul shakes off his boots
oh i see
no you see that must have been raymond
beat very much so
no no one was more surprised than we were
beat no hes
indisposed right now but im sure youll see him again
hes going to stay at the cabin for a while until he
and bless you too
a moose xing sign is briefly illuminated by pauls cars headlights as it heads up a snow packed mountain road
the distant lights of the city are swallowed by the thick forests of fir trees that line the road
paul nervous sings along to escape on the radio
it was my own lovely lady and she said oh its you
paul pulls off
kills his headlights
pops the trunk
the corpse now in raymonds clothing and the blue parka lies face up on the aloha airlines promotional surfboard being lurched forward by paul who wears a pair of snowshoes
on the bodys chest lies a second pair of snowshoes
somewhere a wolf howls
paul at the top of a foot drop
he rolls the corpse now wearing the other set of snowshoes over the side
it bounces down landing in the snow with a soft whumph
paul sits in a seeming stupor at the kitchen table
a ding from the microwave snaps him out of his catatonic state
he walks to the appliance takes out his now re heated coffee checks his watch and heads out
paul wearing snowshoes and carrying the surfboard peeks over the edge
pauls pov down at the corpse exactly as it was last night
well come on
how much easier do i have to make this
his words echo in the cold wilderness
jodie the dog is in a complete frenzy jumping up and down at the feet of paul who stands over a sizzling frying pan full of bacon
he checks the bacons consistency with a fork
still pretty raw
he takes the bacon and lays it on a plate
beside the pan on the counter sit a baseball cap and a stapler
paul carefully takes each strip of bacon and staples it to the peak of the ball cap
he holds it up
the bacon hangs down like fringe
margaret appears in the doorway
startled holy margaret you scared the wits out of me
margaret lifts up jodie whos desperately trying to get at the hat
she just wants that bacon
such a little puppy
how late is rudys open
a large sign outside advertises fresh moose meat
paul runs out with a shopping bag jumps in his car and drives off
paul carrying the shopping bag he painfully picks his way down the rock face toward the corpse
really bad british accent you may want to take a gander
you may want to take a gander
the bacon hat as paul pulls it snug on the corpses head
he pulls the bloody steaks from the shopping bag and starts to smear them on the corpses parka
drops of blood hit the snow at the bodys feet and disappear
paul drapes the steaks on the body tucking one under an arm the other hanging from a pocket
he pauses for moment then pulls out a container of lard and fighting his own revulsion smears it across the dead mans face
sorry about this part
paul pats the body on the shoulder then looks up at the ridge and the long journey ahead
a wolf appears in the moonlight
followed by another and another
they approach the corpse
snowmobiles scream to the site as people tramp through the thick snow covering all of pauls hard work
an ambulance and state conservation vehicles pack the area where paul first pulled off
yellow police tape is strung between fir trees marking a path toward the ridge
the corpse is covered with a tarp
the area is littered with blood animal tracks and bits of blue parka
police officers and tough looking local snowmobilers mill about the corpse taking turns lifting the tarp that covers the body
a few yards away detective boyle s talks to a seemingly distraught paul
looking at the ridge if its any comfort to you he likely wasnt eaten while conscious
did he say where hed been living before he came home
he didnt really talk about it much
he brought us this shell
paul holds up a sea shell obviously from the display at his office
tears well up in his eyes
paul contd its really all we have left
hed been gone for five years
wed given him up for dead yes sir
how did you
anonymous phone tip from some jamaican guy
paul shows no reaction said he saw what looked like a body
we tracked you through his id
just like on tv
boyle nods sympathetically paul contd ive got to see him
paul starts to make his way to the body
boyle stops him
barnell i should warn you an animal attack isnt pretty
theres not much left
they make their way over to the tarp
boyle pulls it back
detective boyle contd is that your brother sir
paul leans in the mans face is hamburger
they chewed his ears off
what kind of animal does something like that
normally id say bear but these tracks and the feeding pattern indicate wolf
its rare but it can happen
boyle pulls the cover back over the body
boyle hands barnell a clear baggie with the dead mans wallet inside
detective boyle contd your brothers personal effects
weve got some people with the victims assistance program who can help you through this
marcie a female police officer walks a distraught paul away
as they go another female cop approaches
coroner found some smaller bite marks on the ankle
must have been the whole freakin pack
you want an autopsy
derek found this
she holds up a clear evidence bag with the remnants of a strip of bacon on the inside
not the smartest snack for a hiker
messy animals arent they
messy messy messy messy
the second level of a large indoor driving range mini golf course
the sound of clubs smacking golf balls echo as an intense ted waggles before his shot
on his back swing tiffany throws her arms around him from behind
i take it youre done
wanna hit some of mine
hugging him harder nope
he turns laughing
they kiss as she playfully starts to grope him
now this is definitely a violation of golf dome policy
must be all this talk about using your wood
so maybe later i can
check your grip
my dirty talk sucks
i like it when you try though
tiffany gives him a peck and flits back to a nearby chair
he hits one skying it into a low hanging light
you know in some states they actually do this outside
tiffany looks over at one of the tacky tropically themed mini golf holes
so how many insurance companies are there in the united states
like a billion
thats not the point tiff
ive busted my ass for liberty capital
i dont want to quit
i deserve to be promoted out of this ice bound backwater
and when it happens i guess ill just be another notch on your briefcase
i cant believe you said that
you know you are
he looks around
embarrassed he lowers his voice
ted contd the most important thing in my life
smiling shouting sorry what was that
you want to take me right here
as other golfers look over tiffany and ted share a warm smile the moment only broken by the ringing of a cell phone
she sighs unzips teds gym bag and answers his phone
tiffany contd psychic
uhm sorry hello
look is this a matter of life and death because right now hes
suddenly concerned she hands the phone to ted
beat youre kidding me
almost stunned yeah ill hold
million dollar life policy just checked
on a saturday
what about the first annual golf sex and pizza triathlon
look if this is
who i think it is i may have found us a ticket out of here
we dont need a ticket
tiffany stands knowing its no use arguing she pulls on her coat
ted tries to give her a hug
she falls into his embrace but doesnt hug him back
tiffany contd dont be late ok
you wont even know im gone
corpses pov black
the drawer is pulled open
ted cam and detective boyle stand at the end near the feet
a white sheet covers most of the deceased
boyle moves toward the head and pulls back the covering
cam leans in for a closer look
thats gotta hurt
so whats your line on this
just what it looks like
wolves got him
maybe a grizzly with insomnia but we didnt find any tracks
would it surprise you to learn his brother tried to cash in his policy two weeks ago
you trying to tell me mr
barnell chewed off his brothers leg
doesnt that make you the least bit suspicious
watters this is a nice simple ending
we like nice simple endings
but shouldnt you ya know i dont know thing one about insurance but im guessing its your job to find a way not to pay these poor people
hey now were just like you guys gotta run down whatever leads we can find
ted walks down to the head of the victim pulls out a camcorder and starts to tape the body
detective were an insurance company not the salvation army
mind telling me what youre doing
they gave every claims team a video camera last quarter
youd be amazed at how it cuts down on litigation
we had this case two months ago where this mother of six was claiming
ive got my own war stories thanks
you mind stopping that
just doing your job
yes i caught that
as ted gets his last shot boyle covers the body back up and slides the drawer shut with a loud clang
tv news camera pov of paul standing on his stoop as hes interviewed by a well made up female tv reporter s dressed for the cold
you ready mr
the camera man flicks on his light as paul squints
the police told us what happened how are you folks holding up
whos out there
paul reaches back and as discretely as possible grabs the door handle to keep margaret from opening it
obviously my wifes very upset
paul the doors stuck
margaret starts to hammer rhythmically on the door
ignoring her its been a tough you know when something like this happens you just have to ask yourself
who fucked with the fucking door
you can see how stressful its been i should really go now
we have to plan a service
and with that paul opens his front door and ducks inside quickly shutting it behind him
branch very unhappy flips through some papers then looks up at ted and cam
this isnt a standard case
you were there when this guy came in looking to cash in
cmon it stinks
secondly if the police say this guy was
eaten by wolves
incredulous eaten by wolves then weve got no case
did you see mr
barnell on the news last night
last thing we need is bad p
i dont want this thing valdeez ing on us
branch im sure head office would take a rather dim view of our corporates view will be whatever i tell them
cam seeing his partner is about to get himself into a heap of trouble hustles him toward the door
color us called off as of now
ted and cam walk through the cubicles
stop looking at me right now
youve got a strange way of bucking for a promotion my friend
off teds look look im gonna start on the johnasen file
you want to do up the paper work on barnell
ted grabs his coat
cam contd where ya going
ted is out the door
ted sits across the desk from paul
as per usual the place is a tomb
the police say they found raymonds wallet thats how they tracked you down
thats right yes
any idea what he was doing out there
hed go for walks
hikes i mean
was he a big hiker
not sure i follow
did he hike more than once a week
or was this a
one time thing
can i ask why you need to know all this
just trying to tie up a few loose ends
you know the police
they say raymond died in the attack
you do cover that sort of thing dont you
forced smile yes sir
it shouldnt take more than a few days
now tell me a little more about your brother
gary and jimbos car parked in the lot
gary is just returning to the vehicle with a brown paper bag

gary laughs again then shoves jimbos shoulder
gary contd maybe were eatin him right now

you can tell me all you want lady but it is an undeniable indisputable fact
this barnell guy got turned into a scooby snack by a pack of wild animals
jims pov through the windshield looking at the sign for barnell great escapes travel
jimbo and gary look at each other
ted at his cubicle on his phone

no more cam goes to the coffee room and ted disappears for three hours
and youll work on your interpersonal skills
a long beat yes
now if youll excuse me ill go start covering your ass
paul sits beside his desk flipping through travel brochures
margaret enters teetering in the doorway
paul looks up
hows my princess
i took some adavan
and called my psychic
picks up the phone bill honey you know how expensive that is
i thought we agreed that
she moves to him runs her hand through his hair
dont be mad
this week has been so
well with raymond getting eaten by animals and someone trying to steal the fridge
why dont you we got another letter from the hmo today
have you opened it yet
margaret starts to cry holding the letter up to her face the sobs building to a full blown breakdown
paul contd oh hey honey come on now
its just fucking cocksuckers
paul takes the letter unfolds it and reads
as we have stated previously
usual onset before the age of
coupled with no genetic history
im really really sick
reading again we hasten to add tourette syndrome is not
paul is about to say something but returns to the letter
as well please reference our previous decisions regarding your claims for add odo ocd treading lightly honey
i know you dont like to talk about it but maybe its not
what we might think it is but
maybe its just stress
remember that cruise
i saw you
you were happy
margaret looks at him crestfallen
paul contd im sorry
im just really tired
they say you cant get it all of a sudden but i did
i really really did
they just dont ill kill myself
then theyll see
that is nonsense talk
then you can go off and
sobbing again marry someone normal
youre the most normal girl i know
im not crazy paul
somethings really wrong with me
he takes her to a small sofa cradles her in his arms
i know sweetie
and were gonna find you the best specialists in
a second then confident what you have that we can
i really think things are going to turn around
call me cr
i just have a feeling
you just leave everything to me ok
is that ok
leave everything to me
gently shit bag
thats my girl
where edward g
robinson as the character keyes in double indemnity grills a man about a fake insurance claim
every time one of these phonies comes along it ties knots in my stomach
i cant eat
thats how i knew your claim was crooked
at the sound of doorbell the whole scene freezes
we are tiffany at her desk working on the computer
ted has paused the dvd puts down the barnell file and opens the door on a snow covered pizza guy soggy pizza box in hand
ted looks at his watch
what about thirty minutes or free
doesnt apply when its snowing
digging out his wallet so nine months of the year your guarantee is worthless
it doesnt snow every day
they should really tell people when they order
would you just give him the money already
its not my decision
i know that
im just saying
you understand though
it wouldnt take much
full disclosure to the pizza consumer
ill be sure to pass that along
the delivery guy leaves
ted walks back into the living room
tiffany comes over grabs a slice
why you gotta argue with the service industry
the problem with people today is they dont expect anyone to tell the truth
weve just come to accept lying as acceptable
if this is another passive aggressive shot at psychic buddies all our ads state for amusement purposes only
tiff it has nothing to do with
look just forget it
you remember being amused dont ya honey
what is with you anyway
want to know whats with me
im on the verge of cracking the biggest case of my career one that corporate has to notice and nobody gives a crap
not my boss and not even my girlfriend
so this is my fault
no its not your fault
i just want to live somewhere where road hazards dont have antlers and the pizza doesnt have to be delivered by dogsled
tiffany storms off as ted flops onto the couch swipes the snow from the top of the pizza box and hits play on the dvd
what kind of outfit is this anyway
are we an insurance company or a bunch of dim witted amateurs to write a policy on a mug like that
tiffany turns from the bedroom door almost in tears
you know even though edward g
robinson wins everyone like fred macmurray better
she slams the door
ted doesnt move lost in his own world
ted and mrs
wherry sit on plastic covered furniture
the mounted heads of several dozen dead animals foxes wolves elk surround them
ted takes notes
it was terrible
raymond should have known better
re the mounted heads all these yours
greatest sport on earth
moved to a compound bow two years ago
less draw weight
she mimics pulling back an imaginary bow with her bony hand
wherry contd coffee ok
did you talk to raymond at all when he came home
was he getting along with his brother
only saw him the once
waved to him
he was clearing my driveway
raymond was a real hellcat when he was younger
but like they say time mellows even the hardest soul
was he much of an outdoorsman
i thought it was paul at first
have you met pauls wife
now theres a story
not that im much for gossip but i think raymond used to have a mrs
wherry im sorry but sorry
did raymond like the outdoors
not so much no
liked living out here at the cabin though
i think he had some friends on the police force
have you talked to them
theyd pull up here day and night always looking for im sorry did you say you thought it was paul who did your driveway
well in a ski mask you can hardly tell whos who
now how bout some jerky
ive got it drying out back
ted at his cubicle thinking hard as he chews on some jerky as he works the phone
snow whips by outside the window
just waiting to cut in thats really super simon
now howd you like to run some names for me
ted sees cam reflected in his dark computer screen
annoyed he puts his hand over the receiver
ted contd you mind
lets not forget whos pulling double duty
hanging up simon ill call you back
to cam forced sorry
turns out our mr
barnell is mortgaged to the nuts
his business is about one step away from chapter
plus its like his brother raymond never existed
hes got no credit history no nothing for the last five years
ya know not having a credit history isnt actually a crime
people around here have been known to swap a snow mobile for pounds of venison
doesnt exactly leave a paper trail
yes but he was in florida someplace
plus the only thing he did after his recent reappearance was get some new id and a new credit card
didnt charge anything
less than nothing
no its not
in my humble junior investigators opinion
the phone rings
ted picks up
yeah hang on
to cam its personal
cam shrugs walks off
ted waits til hes gone
ted contd mr
your ears must have been burning i was just sure what time
ted is scribbling down something on a pad of paper
tombstones barely visible through the blowing snow dot the top of a small hill on the outskirts of town
a small group of mourners try to keep warm
paul and margaret avis two other friends and the minister huddle against the cold
when someone is taken from us at such a young age we often ask ourselves why
what possible purpose could this serve
the minister is temporarily lost from view
minister contd just a voice in the white why is god who is a loving god capable of such things
the snow clears
paul a pillar of strength discreetly checks his watch then sneaks a concerned look at margaret who busily grins at everyone in sight
teds car pulls into the parking area
gary and jimbo sit in their vehicle watching as ted gets out of his car and is swallowed in a white out
he reappears a moment later farther up the hill
we should have checked the funeral announcements right away
a wind gust rocks the casket just as its lowered into the frozen earth
the funeral breaks up quickly as paul and his wife shake hands with the minister
that was lovely thank you so much
margaret paul you two get some sleep
paul looks nervously at margaret who is about to reply
as her mouth engages a gust of wind obliterates most of her words except for
the minister smiles he must have misunderstood
paul turns to see ted approaching
a blast of snow obscures his view
when ted reappears hes just a few steps away
there was no hurry on this we could wait until its ok
we just wrapped up
this is my wife margaret
as they shake hands and margaret opens her mouth to speak
paul contd why dont you wait in the car sweetheart
okee dokee smokee
margaret smiles and totters off
shes under a little strain right now
ted looks down the hill at a small group of tv news vans the reporters just now venturing out into the cold
i see the medias here
they dont give people a moments peace do they
i called them
well theyve been asking me to talk some more about raymond
i thought now might be an appropriate time
and youll just happen to mention your heartless insurance company that hasnt paid off your policy yet
i had to borrow money for the casket mr
you are breaking my heart
no i doubt that
they asked me to bring some photos of raymond
guess its gonna be a pretty big story
he pulls out some shots of his brother
they whip around in the wind and blowing snow
paul contd of course we could walk over there together
you could tell them how deeply moved you were by this tragedy and how
the check is on its way
ted thinks grudgingly impressed with pauls ploy
enjoy your press conference mr
paul stuffs the photos back in his pocket and walks down the hill
ted watches him go is about to leave when a gust of wind forces him to avert his eyes
looking down he sees a photo of raymond barnell on the beach in swim trunks
must have fallen
ted pockets it and moves on
thats your plan
how tough can it be
you ever try digging through six feet of half frozen sod
wed need a back hoe
can you operate a back hoe
do you know where wed get a back hoe
we dont even know for sure
dont you think its a pretty neat coincidence
maybe we just go explain it to dave
he wont take it well
then im all for new options here gary
beat if we give the money back hey wait a minute now
we did the job
we deserve the i did the job gary
i know because i havent been sleeping for the last week
i dont know why youre letting it get to you like this
look lets just not rush into anything
its my turn to step up
i know that
im on it
they look on as paul is interviewed by the reporters
margaret washes down some pills with her morning coffee as she looks at a fawn in the backyard nibbling on a bush
hey little bambi
wheres your mommy
gettin it from some ten point buck
yes she is
yes she is
just then a thumping sound from the garage causes the fawn to bolt
margaret turns suspicious
she picks up the portable phone as she moves toward the door
gary sticks his head inside the now unchained fridge grabs a can of soda from the door rack and closes the door
a moment later he reopens the door
there hanging off the frosty inside is a chunk of the dead mans hair and scalp
gary pulls it off not sure what it means but sure it means something
unseen behind him margaret steps into the garage
she quickly assesses the situation
stay away from our fucking appliances
gary spins shocked to see margaret
lady just calm down
margaret eyes wide with fear unleashes a hailstorm of soda cans knickknacks gardening implements and anything else she can lay her hands on
gary contd hey
i have a he tries to close in on her but the torrent of stuff a rake a whipper snipper an old pair of skates
keeps him pinned down
finally he manages to grab his gun from his pocket
but even as he raises it
a bissel handvac catches him flush in the face
gary contd sud of a bit
he drops to his knees grabbing his nose which is now gushing blood
margaret reaches for her portable phone and starts punching numbers
you are in so much trouble
gary stands pissed off gun aimed at margarets head
lady so help me i gary ducks as the phone whizzes over his head and smashes against the garage wall
he stares at her
a standard corrugated metal storage facility
snow falls in from a large hole thats been cut in the roof
cam and ted clipboard in hand stand by the owner mr
so youre a souvenir wholesaler
for the cruise ship trade mostly
usual stuff stuffed animals your huskies your moose your baby seals your whales your walrus they came in through there
looking up duh
big hole in the roof
i got a list of all the things that are missing
ted stares up at the sky through the ceiling
uh we figure about plus fixing the roof
now i know you guys are gonna bust my fax over your estimate
well have you a check by friday
taking ted aside ted
maybe we should take a look at their inventory list first
this is a simple case cam
bad guys through roof stole stuff
lets clear it and get going
i should tell you
we also had some vcrs we were holding for another company
that could run another couple of
you wanna wrap this up
off his look gotta go primary some time
cam shrugs sure
ted hands him his clipboard and walks out the door closes behind him with a loud bang
now i noticed a nice looking computer in your office
why do you think they left that
margaret sits taped to a lazy boy recliner
gary whos still bleeding from the nose sits across from her
you try and rape me i swear to christ ill bite it off
gary looks confused
the doorbell chimes playing tiny bubbles
we stay in the living room as gary answers it
whats going on
okay now heres the thing just keep an open mind
they both enter the room
jimbo looks at gary is about to smack him when
so what now you gonna get me smokin from both ends
gary and jimbo have no idea how to react
margaret senses their discomfort starts to relax
i just came to look around but she started yelling and hitting me
how the hell is this solving our problem
how is this stepping up
just listen okay
yeah listen if the fat from your neck hasnt stopped up your ears
jimbo looks confused
gary ushers him into the other room
gary and jimbo sit at the table talking
jimbos not happy
this is not what we do
it is now
where would we stash her
too small plus wed have to get her in and out without anyone seeing
and ive seen that sty you call an apartment
see its just a bad idea
a possible idea you see the whirlpool tub
you cant be serious
it could be like a little getaway
off jimbo considering this
paul pulls up hits the garage door opener and drives in
paul walks in from the garage pulls off his jacket
hey maggie magster
how ya paul stops short as he sees margaret gary and jimbo sitting around the table
margarets mouth is taped shut
paul is about to lunge at the men when gary slides his gun into view
paul contd what are you people doing in my house
you have something that belongs to us
i i dont know what youre talking about
do you remember a dead man you found in the dumpster behind your office
paul shocked tries to hold it together
no i cant say that
i mean that would probably stick in my mind a
think hard mr
he tosses the frozen lock of hair onto the table
gary contd think hard
paul realizes hes screwed gestures to the living room
gary sits on the sofa as paul paces
i thought it might be some weirdo sex thing ya know
but you look like a pretty straight arrow
so then im thinking maybe its a scam
maybe somehow our friend is worth some money to you
paul face lets gary know hes dead on
gary contd so whatd you collect
we we had a life insurance policy on my brother
it was for
you know its always you quiet guys
heres how its going to work
we stay here with your wife you go get our guy
we even see you or a cop even roll past shes dead
plus youll have to explain how you scammed the insurance people out of their hard earned money
well call you in three days
have the body and lets say dollars for our trouble
screw with us we start mailing your wife back to you
gary pauses for dramatic effect
gary contd starting with her feet
gary walks in on jimbo and margaret still gagged
gary nods well pleased with himself
he was scared
you used the feet thing didnt you
tiffany comes through the door carrying a sack of groceries
hey little help here
i got pop tarts
she sees the living room wall its covered with charts diagrams and theories
ted on the floor remote control in hand replaying the shots of the body over and over
tiffany contd re the screen dont tell me sound of music
no reaction honey
this is the important part
ted rewinds the tape hits play rewinds it again as tiffany watches quietly at first then with growing frustration
finally she walks over and grabs the remote control
ted contd i was watching that
this stops now
this case is making me and you crazy especially you
tiffany plops on the sofa and starts leafing through teds files
tiffany contd ya know i am trying to be supportive
leading experts agree thats the number one complaint men have about their mates
i dont have any complaints about my
re the file dead guys got a record
he beat the hell out of some guy in bar fight
broke the guys eye socket
tiffany scans the file then looks up at the screen
i think you should read this again
she tosses him the file
margaret still taped to a chair sits at the kitchen table
by the stove gary is cooking an apron tied like a bath towel around his waist
we dont have any money you know
if you want raymonds fucking insurance money
we dont have that either
its none of your business what we want
gary goes back to his cooking
gary contd so how come you talk like you do
i mean cursing all the time
its a disease
its called tourette syndrome
i cant control what i say
youve taken a handicapped person hostage
i hope youre proud of yourself
i saw this thing on tv where they said people with that dont usually curse
they must have got it wrong
i dont think so
it was a movie of the week based on real events
dont most of tourettes people twitch and stuff
margaret just glares
gary contd knowingly oh i get it
you got a spice rack
over the sink
and whats that supposed to mean
on the left
beat and im not
crazy its a physical disease
sometimes i can control it and sometimes you cant
want to know what i think
i think this syndrome is something you read about somewhere and figured hey works for me
ass rimming ball sucker
you can completely abdicate your societal responsibilities say whatever you want whenever you want and slough it off on a illness
maybe i should catch this thing
gee sorry your honor i have a disease that makes me rob s
its called really need a slurpee disease
youve never robbed a in your life you shit eating fuck weasel
what kind of man threatens a woman with a gun anyway
you are so faking it
oh im faking it
is this how you get your kicks you over compensating pussy little fart sack
gary suddenly tense puts down his spoon and picks up his gun
keep your voice down or the gag goes back
you dont scare me
if something bad was going to happen my psychic would have told me
gary awkwardly chambers a round starts gesturing with the gun trying to look tough
margaret contd you put that down now you little bitch or so help me ill start yelling so loud youll have to shoot me
gary confused and embarrassed doesnt know what to do
paul gets out of his car carrying a k mart bag
he looks like hes been crying
wherry waves from her deck
paul sorry to hear about your brother
paul gives a sad smile you moving in
just for a bit
shell come to her senses
they always do
oh the septic lines are frozen so youll have to use the outdoor commode
paul waves as he enters the mobile home closing the door behind him
a light goes on
it starts to snow
paul walks in surveys the interior of the mobile home
pauls pov a year old time capsule of a party that was never cleaned up beer bottles ashtrays and general garbage
to himself would it have killed you to clean up before you left raymond
paul picks up a small box from the floor looks at the label
he puts them on top of a stack of porno mags neatens the pile then heads out
high angle on paul lying in bed wide awake but in the same position weve seen him in when he sleeps with margaret
an electric heater glows beside him
tight on car tires as they pull to a stop on the main road
a pair of heavy mens boots get out start to make their way toward the mobile home
theres a knock on the door
paul heads to the door
who is it
is there a mr
as he unlocks it yes is there something wrong as he opens the door a crack a gloved hand shoves it open
the force of the blow sends paul staggering backward landing in a heap against the wall where a picture of his family tumbles over and shatters on his head
raymond barnell s a bear of man enters picks up paul and throws him through the serving kitchen serving hatch
raymond leans through the hole
he walks around takes a copy of usa today and throws it at paul
thats why i love usa today news from every fuckin state
dont you want to read it
i was eaten by wild fuckin animals
but ya know despite that im feeling pretty god damned chipper
paul beats a hasty retreat stumbling through the mobile home with raymond right on his heels
raymond let me tell you what happened here
we all thought you were
yeah i got that impression
but you had dropped off the face of the earth
and you just decide to make it permanent
but there were no records of you anywhere
with that raymond kicks his brother hard in the ribs
paul doubles over gasping for breath
in certain lines of quasi legal employment using your actual id can be a hinderance
but despite the reliance on aliases its nice to have your actual birth certificate to fall back on
gotta tell ya paul i was pretty pissed
raymond is about to kick him once more but paul puts up a hand begging him to stop
raymond relents then bends over and helps his brother to a sitting position
raymond contd but then i start to think pauls no idiot
he woulda told em its not me
paul can only sit there and wheeze
raymond sits beside him on the floor pulls out a cigarette and lights it
raymond contd so what is it
frame job lawsuit
so wheres my money
a beat theyre still
what you get
paul considers whether or not raymond would even remember
with a shrug almost worth coming back for
whats the split
i get half
not quite trusting him okay
changing the subject you look good
lost some weight
gave up carbs
so what are you doing out here
she not go along with it
how she hold up anyway
actually were not doing so good right now
off his look still cant get one by the goalie huh
gary and margaret sit in silence gary taking margarets pulse
jimbo walks in grocery bag in hand
talked to our friend
were okay for now
hows everything here
oh just great
to margaret seventy six perfectly normal
what a shock
gary jumps up and storms into the bathroom just off the kitchen
hes a little over tired
its been a rough week
for garys benefit really
you and your life partner in the shitter having trouble picking a china pattern
shocked um um
your turn to deal with it
if i come out of this bathroom ill put a bullet in her head swear to god
i have a psychiatric disorder
to gary in the bathroom and so do you
paul looking like a man who recently took a beating shovels the light snow cover that blankets the drive
he looks as teds car pulls up
as ted walks toward him
you said on the phone something about a resolution in our claim
why are you staying out here
paul thinks about this for a long time
my wife and i were having some problems
kind of understandable i guess
seeing as how you killed that man and dumped his body out in the woods
you mean raymond
definitely not raymond
i thought it was at first but thats what was throwing me
im not sure i appreciate your tone
my tone mr
you are going to jail
i will personally see to that
i really think you should go now
you are a liar and thief
paul stabs his shovel into a snow bank then walks to ted
you know mr
watters ive had a pretty rough night so if you wouldnt mind just leaving
paul tries to guide ted away but slips and falls on the snow
ted rolling his eyes reaches down to help him up
noticing the bruises hey
howd you get all cut up
whats say you just move away from him
ted with his hands still on paul turns to see mrs
wherry from her porch a compound bow aimed at his forehead
wherry contd you all right there paul
im fine mrs
just go back inside
i can drop him if you want
turning to watters i think youd better go
ted backs to his car gets in and drives off
paul brushes the snow from his jacket reaches up touches his bleeding forehead the fall having reopened the wound
ive got some fishing line if you want me to stitch that
paul waves her off then stares at the blood on his fingertips
an idea slowly takes hold
raymond pours whiskey into a specialty cup as paul pulls off his coat
he give you the check
he thinks i
itll be fine
maybe ill pay him a little visit
see if we can speed up the process
you dont have to
i figured out a way to take care of things
yeah i was watching from the window
paul agitated pulls the blinds shut
you cant do that raymond
if someone sees you
ya know i been thinking there paulie
raymond walks over to paul
paul tenses expecting to be hit
raymond moves right by to refill his drink
after we get her back from these guys who grabbed her you think your wifell be able to keep her mouth shut
i dont think i
crazy people talk a lot
and i think if you tell your therapist something they can use it in court
she doesnt have a therapist
taking a slug still might wanna think about it
think about what
you crossed over into the bigs now paulie
consorting with felons
got to cowboy up
get tough ya suck hole
im just saying sometimes a man has to make problematic decisions
cull the heard so to speak
off his look paul come on just kiddin around here
dont be such a fuckin stick
raymond an enigma looks at paul then grins just kidding
raymond tenses not really
pauls not sure how to read his brother as they shoot looks at one another sibling rivalry ad absurdum
the sky moves from dark grey to light grey then stops
a thermometer outside on an office tower shows a brisk minus
workers bundle themselves against the cold hurry to work past the drifts piled alongside the road
ted walks in throwing his coat over the wall of his cubicle and is about to sit down when he notices paul in his boss office
ted moves closer
i havent called the police yet but ill tell you it was certainly tempting
ted opens the door to his boss office
paul doesnt notice
paul contd ive had some dealings with diseases of the mind and i can tell you he is not well
branch obviously worried stands
barnell was just telling me about the
meeting you two had
i caught that yes

barnell has some
paul turns to look at ted
he has a large band aid on his forehead scratches and bruises on his face
it takes a second for the dime to drop
you dont think i did this
paul gets up and moves to the other side of the office
ted contd oh come on
i never laid a hand on him
ted his neighbor says

let me show you something
ted digs into his briefcase
he takes out a video tape the police file on raymond and the photo of raymond paul dropped in the snow
paul and branch listen intently as ted paces the tv vcr plays shots of the dead body in the background
wheres the birthmark
your brothers police report listed it
reading from the report
large purple birthmark upper left thigh
leaning into the screen but i dont see it
not on this body

ted points to the photo raymond in the summer wearing shorts with a blotchy purple spot clearly visible on his leg
ted contd so what mr

seconds feel like minutes

well how in the world did that happen
raymond was always
bothered by it
when he came back from
florida hed had it fixed
like removing a tattoo
paul looks at branch
its an excuse ted hadnt thought of before
he did not

paul stands and grabs the photo from off the desk
paul contd and this

and taped his naked body

paul feigning fear shrinks back into the corner
ted contd this is crazy

paul goes white
he hadnt thought about this
that will be just about enough of that
barnell im sorry its all come to this

paul nods stressed and strung out he hugs the wall as he walks out
after a moment

barnell with a complete apology

head office is bumping him a level

the door clangs shut behind paul as he dials his cell phone
yes im wondering what city department would be in charge of
sure i can hold
to himself hang on mag pie just hang on
paul puts a hand to his chest
suddenly dizzy he drops to his knees and starts to retch
tears well up in his eyes
after a few moments the storm passes
still on his knees the person on the line comes back
paul contd yeah hi
i was wondering if you could
but i was
he sits there on hold again waiting
ted walks to his car
as he opens the door wham
a fist to his face drops ted
raymond in a ski mask picks him up opens the car door and lays teds head on the door jamb
listen you little prick weve had just about enough of this
you get me
raymond leans onto the door ted screaming as his head is squashed in the vice
raymond contd so lets just settle this right now ok
we want whats coming to us
ted tries to say yes
raymond releases his grip on the door leans down and grabs teds wallet and walks off
paul walks in on a loud party
raymond drunk out of his head has his arms around two marginal looking hookers
ray not wanting to use his brothers real name
paul contd richard

we should see some serious money any time soon
i have a word with you
paul pulls the sliding door closed behind raymond
whisper are those
laughing i sure as hell hope so cause jehovahs witnesses wont lick your lolly no matter how much you pay them

raymond pulls out the credit card paul got for him
put it on my plastic

its every where i want to be
you cant use that
youre supposed to be dead
theyll track us down
you think they give a shit who pays the bill

paul turns trying to compose himself when he notices a handgun sitting out on the counter
raymond what is
paul pokes at the gun sending the barrel spinning around to face him
raymond grabs it and stuffs it into his pants
thats muh gun paul
pauls cell phone rings
raymond contd dont be long
the little spinners yours
paul picks up the phone as the party revs back up
jimbo is on the wall mounted phone

embarrassed for margaret thats

margaret now gagged sits where we last saw her
she tries to talk through the gag
garys staring at his watch calling out seconds
thirty sorry startinnng
paul pulls the kitchen door closed with his free hand
theres no party
let me talk to my wife
he hands the phone to margaret
gary leaps up and stops him
jimbo pushes past him pulls down margarets gag and holds the phone to her
why are you counting

a wave of relief oh god oh jesus
margaret are you okay
paul we got any more chips
grabs the phone the body

shouting paul the carrot little weasly one wants to carrot screw me with his sick carrot little cock
and hes messing up my kitchen
jimbo annoyed puts the gag back in margarets mouth

i never said anything like looks at his watch in panic yes or no
itll happen tomorrow
put margaret back on
gary lunges for the phone cradle like its the finish line in the meter dash slamming the phone down
i think i managed to avoid a trace
quietly to gary were staying at his house
paul goes to the cupboard and pulls out a box of potato chips
as he turns he sees one of the hookers s standing in the doorway
she gives paul a come hither look
a bruised ted enters once again the only person in the shop
he keeps his parka on
avis stands to greet him
can i help you
paul comes around the corner
he extends his hand shocked to see the bruises on teds face but knowing exactly where they came from
i have your check
thank you i appreciate that
an awkward pause please sit
ted sits at paul desk reaches into his brief case and pulls out an envelope and several forms
paul contd have a little accident there
i was mugged
the cops say it was just a random act of violence
but who knows right
re documents youll have to sign
ted slides the papers across to paul then gets up and moves around over pauls shoulder
ted contd where ive marked it with an x
id also like to apologize for my no please
you dont have to
paul at a loss starts to read the paperwork
he pulls open his desk drawer to grab a pen
ted looks down sees the sea shell in the drawer
thats quite the shell
picking it up it was a gift from raymond
he bought it for me from florida
its all we have to remember him by
paul puts the shell down on the desk
that and a million dollars
things really worked out for you didnt they
lots of cash newly single guy
im not single
so you gonna head down to club med
see how much fun a big bank roll can buy
watters i love my wife
ted cant help but look confused by this simple yet sincere declaration
can we level with each other for a moment
paul nods did you before he can finish his question a delivery driver entering the office with a large box
theres no answer
shes in the back
paul contd will you excuse me
paul gets up to deal with the delivery
ted sullen picks up the shell and turns it over in his hands
avis enter from the back
she smiles at ted then sees the shell
oh thats where you went
she takes the shell and reattaches it to the display for aloha air
ted confused walks over as avis snaps the shell back into place
thats quite the display
they do some very nice in store promotions
paul walks back shocked to see the shell now back on the display
ted just stares at him
avis contd here it is mr
to ted i thought someone might have walked out with it
its not the best neighborhood
avis walks back to her desk
ted and paul hold their look
finally paul walks back to his desk and the paperwork
so right here by the x
ted takes the envelope with the check hands it to paul but doesnt let go
paul tries to pull it free
he looks at ted who looks right through him
just then the lights go out
theyre all in the dark
paul contd we uh
call municipal light and power and let them know ill
stop by in a bit
paul looks at ted embarrassed
ted finally lets go of the check
paul contd thank you
ted shakes his head gets up and walks out
paul seen through the window sits alone in the dark
his face lit only by a small flashlight he is completely still
tiffany on her headset with a customer
ted on the sofa lost in thought and whatevers on the tv
theres nothing to be embarrassed about
a snide glance at ted a lot of people find talking to a psychic very therapeutic
so whats on your mind carlos
an overwrought paul is on the phone with tiffany sitting in the dark
hes got his home phone bill in front of him
i have a situation
do you think its okay to do something kinda bad to someone if you think theyre gonna do something really bad to someone else
what if its a really bad thing
well you probably shouldnt break the law if you can help it
are you really sure theyre going to do this other thing
i dont know
he said some things
he said he was joking but i
i think he might
dont think know
how close are you to the other someone else the one youre trying to protect
crying i just i just
have you ever felt like that
like your own life didnt even matter as long as
touched listen to me carlos
your wife is an incredibly lucky woman
i know relationships are tough but you do what you gotta do to keep it together okay
remember love is sacrifice
ted cant help but snort at the mention of this familiar phrase as he looks at tiffany
tiffany glares back at him
sniffling i guess youre right
now you get tough
and remember this call is for entertainment purposes only
call me back and let me know how it goes
tiffany hangs up and walks out
ted tries to catch her eye and let her know he was just kidding
paul behind the wheel a strange determined look on his face
he appears be steeling himself for something
paul enters slamming the door behind him as raymond looks up from his porno magazine
blowing by shes having sex with them
and with that paul disappears into the back bedroom
paul sits waiting
after what seems like forever raymond walks in
whos doing what
you know that stockholm syndrome thing
when you fall in love with your kidnappers
get the fuck out of here
i went by there
she was in the bedroom with the big one
quietly not the first time either
a flash of panic with other men not kidnappers
and some guy she
sucks to be you
raymond a momentary flash of anger sits on the bed beside his brother
paul does his best not to flinch
i always knew she was a fucking tease
guess you were right
well you want my opinion
paul nods i dont trust her paul
you think shed
really mess things up
only one way to make sure she doesnt
not sure what youre saying
you remember that pooch mom had
crazy little jack russel with the bladder infection
whole basement stank
nothing you can do but put the thing out of its misery
you sure ray
trust me bro
leaky dogs crazy women
two things no man should have to live with
as ray stands to go paul nods his heart ripped apart for any number of reasons
paul sits in the managers office signing forms
a large bank guard stands nearby
one million dollars in hundred dollar bills neatly stacked on the desk
paul with his sack of one million dollars at his feet is calmly trying on new winter coats with a clerk
he feels each one checking the amount of padding
he finally settles on a red full length down parka
the lights are back on as paul wearing his oversized red parka comes through the front door carrying his sack of cash
avis looks up
i didnt expect you back today
youve been with me for five years
can we make it paul
paul enters the back room closes the door
avis walks over
i just thought it was more professional when people were around to call you mr
there havent been any people in here for months
no one comes in here unless theyre looking for pornographic movies or deep fried fish neither of which we carry
so you can call me pretty much anything you want and it wont impress the customers at all because we dont have any
are you ok paul
paul opens the door
avis is surprised to see billowing clouds of down floating in the air behind him
no avis to be frank im a little frazzled right now
now could you get me some tape my passport out of the safe and two open ended tickets to paraguay
paul shuts the door
avis gets to work
arnith and bill two city workers sit sipping coffee at a cafeteria table
the room is white very clean and fairly new
the men wear large orange overalls their white construction safety helmets sit on the table beside them
trouble is the city keeps cutting us back and cutting us back
raymond and paul wearing his big red parka enter
excuse me are you arnith
arnith sips his coffee points to his name patch but doesnt look up
paul contd great
i was told to give you this
paul hands arnith a folded form
arnith puts his hand out forcing paul to move the form to him
as arnith looks at it
paul contd disinterment order
got it from the coroners office
my brother didnt want to be buried
howd you know
that he didnt want to be buried
he left it in a letter
and you just got it now
ya know i dont mean to be rude here but im not sure this is any of your business
thats entirely possible
bill stifles a laugh
raymond is about to tear out arniths spine
paul holds his brother back
i i dont think this is anything to be flippant about
i appreciate that sir
but im on a union specified break right now which means you are talking to me as a private citizen
now as a private citizen i can pretty much say whatever i want to
if you talk to me in minutes i can assure you you will be afforded every courtesy as specified in the workers policy guide and recently ratified in our latest
collective agreement dated sorry
im just trying to get your brother out of the ground
we couldnt be more pleased
youve arranged for transportation of the remains
were gonna take him to go
see now thats a problem
we cant release the body into your custody unless you are licensed by the state to convey deceased persons
good point bill
bill knows exhumation policy
you can look it up but im betting hes right
you come back with a bonded agent and well get right on this
paul thinks for a moment digs into his pocket pulls out five crisp new hundred dollar bills and slams them on the table
ill give you five hundred dollars to go get him now
a large back hoe turns over
the muffler belches a cloud of black smoke into the air
arnith is at the controls expertly maneuvering the shovel end towards the unmarked grave
the trunk lid opens as bill and arnith dump a well wrapped body unceremoniously into the trunk
arnith and bill look at each other
bill closes the lid
there ya go mr
snug as a bug in a rug
anything else we can get you
ted sits at the bar beside cam
ted close to being drunk plays with a book of matches as a stripper struts to tennessee ernie fords version of tons
can you believe that
one little case and boom youre the flavor of the month
without a trace of sincerity congratulations
why are you here
i really owe you
if you hadnt given me a shot on that forget it
im trying to
so we were all kinda wondering
what did happen to your face
beat car trouble
ted gets up a little shaky on his feet
should you be driving
ted gets up and walks to the door
ted exits a blast of arctic wind and snow hits him in the face
he closes his eyes letting the cold run over him
margaret sits at the dinner table as gary puts down an overly large serving plate of tuna casserole
jimbo walks in takes a seat and a scoop full of food
how you feel about the turnout by summit hill where the snowmobilers park
they all dig in
gary looks expectantly
just the sound of chewing
finally he cant wait
gary contd to jimbo you like it
tastes like a rectal polyp
a long protracted silence
to gary how would she know
gary chuckles as he gets up for some ketchup
margaret stares at jimbo who gives her a ill say what i need to have peace in this house
margaret smiles then discretely slides him the salt
jimbo quickly douses his food
ted pulls up in front of pauls home
he stares at something that looks like a tree on the front lawn
he looks closer its a for sale sign
blowing town are we mr
i dont think so
ted staggers through the snow to the sign and drunkenly pushes it down into the snow
ted contd im not done yet travel man
you hear me
laughing he takes some matches from his pocket and tries to light the for sale sign on fire
its no use
hes cold now
he gets up and staggers back to his car
raymond half in the bag sits on the sofa
see i could have had her
we both know that but i figured she was such a
i mean i dont know why
you know why
you want a refill
does a duck shit under water
paul walks in with two glasses
he hands raymond the larger
raymond contd any trouble getting the bank to handle that much cash
they said itd be in tomorrow by right right you told me
then all we have to do is get her and the thing
hey remember that time in school when i jumped out and scared you and you fucking peed all over yourself
was pretty funny
raises his mug bottoms up
remember how they called you that
about to drink then christ what time is it
raymond laughs takes the drink
a beautiful winters night the soft snowy silence broken only by raymonds drunken shot of
a startled rabbit scurries across the snow
raymond is passed out on the sofa
paul sits gun in hand the barrel pointed at raymonds forehead
his finger grazes the trigger
but its suddenly all too real
paul lowers the gun takes a deep breath and tries again
not wanting to be sprayed by raymonds gray matter he half turns his head
another idea comes to him
paul picks up a plastic picnic plate to use as a shield from the blow back
he gets ready to fire again then makes the mistake of looking at raymond
maybe its the light
maybe its the small puddle of drool on the cushion but he looks almost angelic
paul stares at his brother
in the kitchen paul fills a glass with water empties the pistols bullets into the cup and hides it on the top shelf
paul puts the gun back
not sure of his next move he spots the beat up clock radio lying next to his brother
margaret still tied up lays on top of the bed covers
gary walks past looks in checks his watch then heads to the bathroom
margaret listens as gary turns on the jacuzzi tub jets
as he starts singing margaret sits up and scooches over to the phone on the end table
her hands tied loosely to her chest she manages to dial by placing the phone receiver flat on the bed
you seen my shirt
margaret looks over to see jimbo wearing pauls pajamas walking past while shaving with a portable razor
as the line rings
contd aw jeez again
it relaxes me
you know it has twelve different settings
no gary i dont know that because every time i thought about using it someone was in it
hey i do a lot around here
as they continue to squabble the phone line connects
you have reached
all our operators are busy but your call will be handled in the order in which it was received
if this is a margaret using her nose hangs up
paul quiet as a mouse and dressed in his money lined parka picks up his cell and his car keys drops them quietly into his pocket
just as he finishes
half asleep whats going on
were out of coffee
but ill be right back
not to worry
raymond has already rolled over
margaret has just dialed another number
it rings on the other end
the number you have dialed is no longer in service
if you think you have margaret disconnects the call then dials again
a woozy ted is trying to keep tiffanys phone from ringing
finally he puts on the headset and hits a computer key
he hits a few keys on the computer keyboard
the screen pops to life
the line connects
oh thank fucking christ
is tiffany there
he pulls off a yellow post it note stuck to the computer
it reads coffee made
dont touch my computer
unseen on the computer screen beside him the name margaret barnell pops up along with all her pertinent information like pets name husband delusions
ted contd shell be back in a few minutes
you want to try later
well you should know fuck wit
you know theres a man with a gun in my shower right now
ted distracted turns as he hears the doorknob turning
hang on shes on her way finally he notices the computer screen
ted contd tentatively mrs
but before she can answer tiffany walks in carrying a laundry basket pulls the headset off teds head and holds it up to her ear
im here margaret
how you feeling today
give me the headset
ted grabs for the headset tiffany resists
to ted what is wrong with you
margaret sits in the same position on the bed by the phone
gary in the shower belts out some show tune
christ where do you want to start
tiffany shoves ted who loses his balance and stumbles backward
she puts on the headset
sorry about that
could you speak up a bit
ted is at her side trying to listen in by pressing his ear to the outside of the headset
whats she saying
something about the gay mafia taking her to a park to kill her
can you hand me my help line list
teds throat seizes up again
he stumbles to the kitchen gulping water from the faucet
tiffany watches with some amusement
margaret are you sure these are real people in your house
find out where she
his voice locks up again
listening to a profane ramble well then its a good thing you called
nope not seeing any problems but hang on let me really concentrate
teds not doing much better
margaret hears the shower stop running
shit on toast
she hangs up places the gag back in her mouth and hustles back into place
ted pulls on his boots and his jacket
in his hand an address scribbled down on a piece of note paper
tiffany watches not happy
youre sure this is it
she specifically mentioned the cock sucking turnout up the highway where the snowmobilers hang out
ill call later
i wont be here
the phone rings
tiffany lets it
i know relationships arent all sunshine and roses but im really not having fun anymore and i dont think you are either
god nows so not the time tiff
maybe you have to be like this right now and im just not in a good space to deal with it
maybe we shouldnt be like this together
tiffany gives him that look every man whos ever crossed the line for the last time is all too familiar with
words fail him
finally his only recourse is to hurry out the door which shuts with a bang
tiffany lets the phone continue to ring as she stares at the door
sadly she hits the computer key that picks it up
tiffany contd psychic buddies
how are you mr
i think shed be fine with you remarrying but hang on let me concentrate
ted opens the door steps back inside
to ted really
ive been cutting you out of my life and as a result our normal communication channels have been blocked
i think you coming with me would
hes reaching but tiffany looks cautiously hopeful
ted contd further the development of our relationship and allow us to both
realize the potential of our
if youre going to be sarcastic
im not being anything
swear to god
why do you want me to come
total sincerity cause if you dont then ill have to stay and ill be mad at you and eventually well break up over it and as bad as my life
is right now that would make it a million times worse
tiffany smiles genuinely touched
into the phone mr
bennett shes totally cool with it
but listen youre gonna have to call back
i gotta go help my boyfriend
paul drives smiling for the first time in a long time
he listens to the beautifully wrenching iz kamakawiwooles version of somewhere over the rainbow on the radio
the music continues over the next two scenes
ted and tiffany walk out to their car
they sneak looks at each other not entirely sure what emotional sign post they just passed
gary and jimbo with margaret hands bound walk into the garage
jodie the dog runs out after them
margaret looks at jimbo who takes the dog and gently puts him back inside
ted and tiffany drive in silence
okay its called the listening game
you talk i listen and i cant interrupt
then we switch
doesnt sound like much of a game but
i can talk about anything
ted smiles and launches in
gary leans into the backseat and holds a magazine in front of margarets face
see the little box down there
lists all the symptoms of that tourettes thing and you dont have half of them
and youre faking it
magazines dont prove anything
gary can we just try and get there in peace
magazines prove everything
the residence seen from a distance
that little prick
as the camera rushes the mobile home from inside comes the sounds of a very angry man
then just as were at the door it slams open
raymond stands in the doorway a mountain of anger in a hastily pulled on parka
hes holding the clock radio by the cord
he checks his wristwatch then smashes the clock radio against the trailer
stalking toward his car he checks the pistol in his side pocket then almost as an afterthought opens the clip
a not well frequented tourist spot featuring an expansive far as the eye can see carpet of white
the road from the turnoff is about yards long leading to a plowed out parking area
the road is the only way in or out
pauls car takes the corner and heads toward the parking area
margaret in the back jimbo and gary in the front
you cant be serious
im still not sleeping
its a thought okay
with hard work you can live okay as a civilian
after all this
yeah after all this
dont you go soft on me jimbo
margaret laughs through her gag in the backseat
gary and jimbo pretend not to hear her
they drive on in silence
gary and jimbos car pulls in sliding to a stop beside paul
tiffany and ted drive
ted has just finished
tiffany has been paying rapt attention
so this is kind of like a really weird law and order episode
and if paul barnell already killed his brother
maybe his wife is next
ted nods now a healthy relationship is
hey here we are
ted takes the turnoff to the parking area
a young bored female clerk is behind the counter as the door chimes go off
she looks up to see raymond walking in gun in hand
raymond lays it on the counter
teds car pulls up at the far end of the lot about yards from where paul gary and jimbo are parked
pauls car is in between teds car and jimbos
paul gets out of his car as do jimbo and gary
paul looks for margaret in the back of jimbos car but she remains lying down on the backseat
ill assume youve got our friend back there
you can let her go now
ted looks at pauls car too far away to see much
hes about to get out when tiffany stops him
gently so do you have a plan here
im gonna go talk to him
you mind staying here
so when do we call the cops
soon as i
if he actually is doing
ill wave alright
tiffany gives him a quick kiss
thats a very good plan
teds about to jump out of the car but has to pull back his door as another vehicle slides in beside them the driver locking his brakes and sliding into
the snow embankment
tiffany contd tourists
ted a confused look on his face looks over as raymond gets out of his vehicle
tiffany contd what
ted too excited fumbles with his seat belt as he tries to jump out of the car
the lid opens
jimbo gary and paul look in at the frozen body
jimbo recoils at the mangled mess before him
gary reaches down and touches the well chewed body
how do we know its him
where would i get another one
paul hands him the ransom money
ted rushes up beside raymond
i know you
raymond shoots him a look
clearly this was taken as a threat
ted cant help but step back
ted contd that came out so wrong
raymond sizes up ted then looks off to pauls car
go away now
raymond walks on
ted realizing he has no choice runs and jumps in front of raymond blocking his way
okay i dont know exactly whats going on here but if you would come with me to my office just for a few minutes it would really help me out
with my boss
raymond steps around ted
ted stays with him
ted contd look im not trying to screw with your life at all but you cant just walk off with a million dollars and expect people to stops cold how
see your brother has and i use this term carefully stolen a million dollars from my insurance company
now if we before he can finish raymond hits him with an elbow to the temple
ted drops to his knees but even as raymond tries to walk off ted manages to grab his ankle
tiffany is busy fiddling with the radio missing the fight just outside her window as she tunes in the beach boys wouldnt it be nice
at jimbos car gary is folding the corpse into the trunk as jimbo pulls margaret upright from the backseat and tugs down her gag
she smiles at him as with great care he helps her out of the car and presents her to her husband
its all over honey
its all over
did they hurt you
smiling whisper does food poisoning count
have you been eating
you know me when i get busy
she touches the bruise under his eye
did you fall
just a little
to jimbo hey were gonna get
thats when paul sees what jimbo and gary are watching
raymond kicks ted in the head turns spots paul and breaks into a run
paul seems frozen but just for a moment
who the hell is that
paul discretely takes off his red parka and drapes it over margarets shoulders
quietly honey i need you to start walking to that hill over there alright
ill catch up in a bit
now no matter what you hear just keep going alright
and if im
late or something just look in the coat alright
margaret nods kisses her husband quickly on the cheek then starts to walk off
paul gary and jimbo watch transfixed at the down parkad shit storm that is headed their way
yelling a million dollars paul
you really think you could take me
what million dollars
gary and jimbo look over at paul somewhat confused
raymonds ten yards out and they can now see hes taken out his gun
hes aiming it at paul
paul looks over his shoulder at margaret whos having some trouble making it up a snow covered hill
garys hand slips into his pocket grabbing hold of his gun
raymond oblivious moves right past
tiffany finally looks over at ted whos just getting to his feet
she bursts out of the car
raymond reaches paul takes the gun and points it at the top of his head
pauls eyes shut tight expecting the worst
but shooting your brother is tougher than it looks
paul opens his eyes
raymond tries to pull the trigger again but cant
he moves the barrel six inches to the right and shoots margaret in the back
she drops face first into the snow
pauls world ends
ears ringing he rushes toward his wife
jimbo cant believe it as gary holds him back
what the fuck
raymond a look of relief on his face turns to jimbo
jimbo contd she had nothing to do with this
and you do
but even before raymond can raise his weapon gary pulls his gun and gets it pointed shakily at raymond
raymond contd oh put it down nancy
just raymond drops his gun to his side
gary smiles too happy he won the face off
you win tough guy
gary trying to be cool flips the gun to his other hand
as he does bang
the bullet rips into the snow about six feet from raymonds feet
raymond glares at gary
so does jimbo
meek apologetic sorry
jimbo lunges for cover as raymond fires back
gary truly terrified closes his eyes as he squeezes off shots on the run bangbangbangbang
one bullet bounces off pauls car
one hits raymond
with a quizzical look on his face he drops to his knees
a large crimson stain forms on his jacket
everything goes quiet except for the sounds coming from
paul almost crazed with grief cradles his wifes body
muffled oh fucking hell
paul gently turns her over
margaret alive unharmed but winded tries to catch her breath
margaret contd paul
someone kicked me
paul feels around the bullet hole and pulls out a stack of money now embedded with the slug from the raymonds gun
he starts to weep tears of relief
can you stand
gary is behind the other car with jimbo
starting to lose it he just fell
oh jesus oh god
jimbo gently takes garys gun
as jimbo puts an arm around gary and helps him to the car he sees paul arm around margaret coming their way
a look passes then both couples move off
as jimbo and gary drive away paul brings margaret to his vehicle
spotting raymond he walks over kicks the gun away then leans down
raymonds not dead but hes close
paul has to turn away
laboured look at me you little
paul turns back not angry not frightened just a little sad
raymond taken aback for a moment tries for one last verbal shot but all he can manage is
raymond contd puddles
and raymond dies
paul turns back to his car when he spots a delirious damaged ted stumbling toward him with tiffany desperate to drag him the other way
where do think youre going
ted leave him alone
no no no
i have been beaten humiliated had my head squeezed by a guy
and i am getting some answers right now
ted barely able to stay on his feet concussion gets in front of paul and just stands there and waits
paul cant help but feel bad for the guy
well go ahead
re his left ear i can still kind of hear out of this one
a long pause i love my wife mr
and when you love someone i mean really love someone
the punch hits paul on the top of his head
he stumbles back but ted is on him before he can move out of range
its a strange looking fight between the younger physically spent and older emotionally drained
between punches i want a fucking hallmark card or the lyrics to a foreigner rock ballad ill go to the mall mr
margaret and tiffany jump in trying to pull the two men apart
the car is still in the parking area
paul and a bloody beaten ted sit up front with margaret and tiffany in the back
no one speaks until
they call this the listening game
barnell you get to go first
ted glares at tiffany but her look instantly softens him
ted looks at margaret who looks expectantly at paul
knock yourself out
paul starts to talk and ted starts to listen
arnith the grave digger walks to the side of a casket
he hits the switch and it starts to drop
arnith watches impassively taking brief note of two people up the hill before returning to his work
its gary and jimbo dressed in black
they watch silently as raymond is laid to rest
the sun beats down on a white sand tropical paradise
the wind is calm the water azure blue
perfection except for the snow
big pure white flakes cutting across this idyllic poster that hangs in a book store window
tiffany stares at her reflection in the window her face transported to an island paradise
ted walks out
so where you want to go
my three oclocks been moved up
you alright about everything
the life policy was written on his brother and he did you know die
i may be rationalizing a bit but ethically i think im okay
i like it when youre okay
the two walk down the street
snow keeps falling
tiffany shuts her eyes looks straight up as the gossamer snowflakes land and melt on her face
shes never looked more beautiful
tiffany contd dont ya just love this weather
ted stares at her
tiffany grabs his hand and pulls him away disappearing into the whiteness
paul sitting alone reads a postcard from margaret
pauly know it sounds corny but i miss you so much
wish you could have come
saw some dolphins today
frisky little buggers
they were even playing our song in the bar
have been pondering about your question and i think my answer is yes
after all its no fun in the sun without
contd paul you ready
paul looks up to see margaret
dressed in a coat she is standing in the middle of the living room now empty save for a few boxes and a very ugly floor lamp
paul flips margarets letter over and we now see it is the faded hawaiian hilton postcard from the box in his den
paul puts the postcard in a shoe box full of keepsakes and tucks it under his arm
margaret picks up jodie whose in his carrying case and walks over
a car horn sounds from outside
its their cab
as they walk to the door
how you feeling
pretty damn good
i can tell
paul takes her hand and gives it a squeeze
they head out
snowing now as various people walk toward the aircraft and the portable stairs rolled to the door
paul and margaret among the crowd exchange nervous but hopeful smiles then they are lost along with the other pilgrims in the swirling white
dave and his wife s walk out of their house toward their car
they get in dave behind the wheel
as they pull down the driveway
why dont we go there after
off her look fine
well do it now
watch the curb
dave keeps backing up
as he takes the corner and bumps over the curb the momentum sends the half eaten body that gary and jimbo stuffed into the backseat to an upright position
they drive on oblivious
looks like weather
