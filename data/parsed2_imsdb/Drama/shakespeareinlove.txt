by marc norman tom stoppard sky
over which a title london summer appears
title card in the glory days of the elizabethan theatre two playhouses were fighting it out for writers and audiences
north of the city was the curtain theatre home to englands most famous actor richard burbage
across the river was the competition built by philip henslowe a business with a cash flow problem
gradually a building is revealed the rose theatre three tiered open to the elements and empty
on the floor roughly printed a poster torn soiled out of date
it says over this the screams of a man under torture
the screams are coming from the curtained stage
why do you howl when it is i who am bitten
the theatre owner phillip henslowe is the man screaming
henslowes boots are on fire
he is pinioned in a chair with his feet stuck out over the hot colas of a fire burning in a brazier
he is being held in that position by lambert who is a thug employed by fennyman who is the owner of the voice
the fourth man frees is fennymans bookkeeper
what am i mr
how badly bitten mr
twelve pounds one shilling and four pence mr
fennyman including interest
i can pay you
two weeks three at the most aaaagh
for pitys sake
take his feet out
where will you get the mathematical genius with a notebook sixteen pounds five shillings and nine pence including interest in three weeks
i have a wonderful new play
put his feet in
its a comedy
cut his nose off
a new comedy
by will shakespeare
and his ears
and a share
we will be partners mr
its a crowd tickler mistaken identities a shipwreck a pirate king a bit with a dog and love triumphant
i think ive seen it
i didnt like it
this time it is by shakespeare
whats the title
romeo and ethel the pirates daughter
fennyman snaps his fingers at frees and lambert
lambert unties henslowe frees starts writing a contract
a play takes time
lets say open in three weeks
thats what five hundred groundlings at tuppence each in addition four hundred groundlings tuppence each in addition four hundred backsides at three pence a penny extra for a cushion call
it two hundred cushions say two performance for safety how much is that mr
twenty pounds to the penny mr
but i have to pay the actors and the authors
a share of the profits
theres never any of course not
fennyman i think you may have hit on something
fennyman slaps a contract down on the table next to n ink pot and quill
henslowe takes the quill and signs
romeo and ethel the pirates daughter
without doubt he is completing it at this very moment
a small cramped space in the eaves of a building
a cluttered shelf containing various objects wedged between crumpled pieces of paper
among those we have time to observe a skull a mug that says a present from at infrequent intervals further pieces of crumpled paper are tossed towards the shelf
the man who is throwing them will shakespeare is bent over a table writing studiously with a quill
now we see what he is writing will is practising his signature over and over again
each time he is dissatisfied and each time he crumples and tosses it away
suddenly will becomes impatient
he jumps up and goes to the loft area in the rafters where he sleeps and starts to pull on his boots
at this point the door opens and henslowe walks in
he is out of breath and his feet hurt
where is my play
tell me you have it nearly done
tell me you have it started
desperately you have begun
struggling with his boots doubt that the stars are fire doubt that the sun doth move no no we havent the time
where is my play
tapping his forehead and heading out the door it is all locked safe in here god be praised
then doubt locked
as soon as i have found my muse will lives in a crowded area of the city
hawkers are crying their wares tract sellers delivery boys and merchants go about their business
henslowe catches up with will as he strides purposefully along
catching up who is she this time
she is always aphrodite
aphrodite baggot who does it behind the dog and trumpet
henslowe you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate
well i am a dead man and buggered to boot
my theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks my company is playing the inn yards of england while burbage and the chamberlains men are invited to court and
receive ten pounds to play your piece written for my theatre by my writer at my risk when you were green and grateful what piece
no its comedy they want will
like romeo and ethel
who wrote that
you are writing it for me
i gave you three pounds a month since
half what you owed me
i am still due for one gentleman of verona
henslowes hardly paused in his appeal
what is money to you and me
i your patron you my wordwright
when the plague lifts burbage will have a new christopher marlowe for the curtain and i have nothing for the rose
henslowe will you lend me fifty pounds
staggered fifty pounds
burbage offers me a partnership in the chamberlains men
for fifty pounds my hired player days are over
cut out my heart
throw my liver to the dogs
answering for him no then
will turns down a side street
henslowe and will are crossing a crowded marketplace where a puritan preacher makepeace is haranguing anyone who will listen
and the lord shall smite them
yea harken to me
the theatres are handmaidens of the devil
under the name of the curtain the players breed lewdness in your wives rebellion in your servants idleness in your apprentices and wickedness in your children
and the rose smells thusly rank by any name
i say a plague on both their houses
as he passes will gratefully makes a mental note
will turns into a narrow street and walks toward a doorway
where are you going
to my weekly confession
as henslowe arrives the door closes in his face
a sign identifies the place as the premises of dr
moth apothecary alchemist astrologer seer interpreter of dreams and priest of psyche
henslowe looks puzzled
a stuffed alligator hangs from the ceiling pills potions amulets and charms star charts and mystic paraphernalia festoon the place
testimonials and framed degrees hang on the walls
will lying on a couch on his back
his eyes are closed dr
moth sits by the couch listening to will and occasionally making a note on a pad he holds on his knee
what we have here is nothing less than the false dawn of analysis
the session is being timed by an hourglass
words words words
once i had the gift
i could make love out of words as a potter makes cups out of clay love that overthrows empires love that binds two hearts together come hellfire and brimstones
for sixpence a line i could cause a riot in a nunnery
but now and yet you tell me you lie with women
will seems unwiling to respond
moth refers to his notes
black sue fat phoebe rosaline burbages seamstress aphrodite who does it behind the dog and interrupting aye now and again but what of it
i have lost my gift
i am here to help you
tell me in your own words
i have lost my gift
not finding this easy its as if my quill is broken
as if the organ of the imagination has dried up
as if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed
it is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring
shrewdly tell me are you lately humbled in the act of love
will turns towards him
how did he know that
how long has it been
a goodly length in times past but lately no no
you have a wife children the sand runs through the hourglass
not much sand left
i was a lad of eighteen
anne hathaway was a woman half as old again
a woman of property
shrugs she had a cottage
one day she was three months gone with child so and your relations
on my mothers side the ardens no your marriage bed
four years and a hundred miles away in stratford
a cold bed too since the twins were born
banishment was a blessing
so now you are free to love yet cannot love nor write it
moth reaches for a glass snake bracelet
here is a bangle found in psyches temple on olympus cheap at four pence
write your name on a paper and feed it in the snake
will looks at the snake bangle in wonder
will it restore my gift
the woman who wears the snake will dream of you and your gift will return
words will flow like a river
i will see you in a week
he holds out his hand
will drops a sovereign into it and takes the bracelet
will comes out
henslowe is waiting standing in a horse trough to ease his feet
will walks straight past him and henslowe follows
to the palace at whitehall
whitehall means nothing yet
we are behind closed curtains on a stage busy with preparations for the imminent performance of two gentlemen of verona
this is not a theatre but a banqueting hall as we will see
richard burbage is to play proteus
a boy player will play silvia and last minute improvements to his makeup etc
are being applied by burbages mistress rosaline
launce one of the clowns is the famous comedian will kempe
launces dog crab is in kempes charge and is not helping much
there is no set
a helpful placard reading verona an open place is ready to hand
musicians can be heard tuning their instruments
from the other side of the curtain there is an expectant bubbub
kempe leads the dog into the wings and rummages in a box of proops
he finds a skull
he has one foot on the box his elbow on his knee he looks at the skull
in other words he reminds us of hamlet
we see this from the pov of will who is just entering through a door backstage
approaching prithee mr
kempe break a leg
you too good crab
crab is nervous
he has never played the palace
when will you write me a tragedy will
i could do it
no they would laugh at seneca if you played it
wills attention has been caught by rosaline burbages mistress
rosaline is big breasted dark eyed dark haired sexual
to rosaline my sleeve wants for a button mistress rosaline where were my seamstresss eyes
burbage kisses her mouth and slaps her behind
he comes over to greet will
there is no dog in the first scene will kempe thank you
how goes it will
i am still owed money for this play burbage
not from me
i only stole it
when are you coming over to the chamberlains men
when i have fifty pounds
rosaline brings over the last elements of burbages costume and helps him into them
are you writing
nods somewhat defensively a comedy
all but done a pirate comedy wonderful
what is the chief part
wit swordsman lover
romeo i will play him
bring it tomorrow
its for henslowe
he paid me
youre a liar
burbage digs under his costume for his purse which is on a waistband over his corset
i swear it
he wants romeo for ned and the admirals men
ned is wrong for it
will turns to see henslowe approaching
to will here is two sovereigns ill give you two more when you show me the pages
arriving burbage i will see you hanged for a pickpocket
the queen has commanded she loves a comedy and the master of the revels favours us
and what favour does mr
tilney receive from you
the master of the revels tilney comes through the curtain officiously
he disappears back through the curtains
the hubbub falls silent rather dramatically and all the busy players know what that means they all crowd to the curtain and find places to peep through
the arrival of queen elizabeth aged sixty coming to take her place in the audience at front centre
the hill is crowded with lords and ladies bowing elizabeth to her seat which is raised high on a pedestal affording the queen an uninterrupted view of the play and
the audience an uninterrupted view of the queen
close on a small piece of paper a quill is writing w
will rolls the paper up carefully and slips it into the mouth of the snake bangle
the curtain draws back and condell as valentine and burbage as proteus begin the play
cease to persuade my loving proteus home keeping youth have ever homely wits
with burbagess presence accounted for on stage rosaline curls an arm around wills neck
they kiss hungrily
after a moment will pulls back
when will you write me a sonnet will
i have lost my gift
you left it in my bed
come to look for it again
are you to be my muse rosaline
burbage has my keeping but you have my heart
will takes the snake bracelet and slips it onto her arm
rosaline looks at it then at will
then they kiss again but will is distracted by the sound of coughing from the auditorium
the consumptives plot against me
will shakespeare has a play let us go and cough through it
valentine is on stage with proteus
to be in love where scorn is bought with groans coy looks with heart sore sighs one fading moments mirth with twenty watchful weary tedious nights
as the scene continues will appears at the back of the hall and finds himself next to henslowe
i feel a scene coming on
is it about a pirates daughter
it is later and kempe is now on stage with his dog
the audience is roaring
queen elizabeths idiosyncratic laugh rises above the others
well played master crab i commend you
she throws a sweetheart on the stage and the dog wolfs it down
love and a bit with a dog thats what they like
now we meet viola
viola de lesseps is twenty five and beautiful and she is laughing with great natural enjoyment
she sits slightly apart from her small family group her parents sir robert de lesseps and lady margaret de lesseps
part of the group but seated behind as befits her lower status is violas nurse
elsewhere is lord wessex our villain
wessex is in his forties dark cruel self important
he has noticed viola
the nurse notices him
valentine is on stage alone
he is speaking the speech rather more coarsely than the version we hear later
what light is light if silvia be not seen
what joy is joy if silvia be not by
unless it be to think that she is by and feed upon the shadow of perfection
now we see that viola knows the speech by heart and is silently mouthing it with the actor
theres a lady knows your play by heart
but when he turns to will he finds that will has gone
will comes into his room goes straight to his table in the window and arranges pen ink and paper
now he has his ritual he spins round once in a circle rubs his hands together and spits on the floor
then he sits down picks up his pen and stares in front of him
then he begins to write
the nurse is undressing her though viola tries intermittently to push her away
she is still bright with excitement
did you like proteus or valentine best
proteus for speaking valentine for looks
i liked the dog for laughs
but silvia i did not care for much
his fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons
stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats
oh when can we see another
when the queen commands it
but at the playhouse
now the nurse is cleaning violas ears one by one of course
she has an ear cleaning implement for this
playhouses are not for well born ladies
i am not so well born
well monied is the same as well born and well married is more so
lord wessex was looking at you tonight
all the men at court are without poetry
if they look at me they see my fathers fortune
i will have poetry in my life
love above all
like valentine and silvia
not the artful postures of love but love that over throws life
unbiddable ungovernable like a riot in the heart and nothing to be done come ruin or rapture
love like there has never been in a play
beat i will have love or i will end my days as a
as a nurse
kissing her but i would be valentine and silvia too
good nurse god save you and good night
i would stay asleep my whole life if i could dream myself into a company of players
viola goes over to the window
the nurse thrusts a twig to her face
clean your teeth while you dream then
automatically viola takes the twig and begins brushing her teeth all the while looking downriver towards the rose
the nurse attends her with a beaker of water and a bowl
now spit viola gazes longingly towards the rose
and there and then she makes a plan
henslowe is making his way from the theatre to the market place when fennyman and lambert appear at either shoulder and propel him back the way he came
frees follows behind
this time we take your boots off
what have i done mr
the theatres are all closed by the plague
by order of the master of the revels
fennyman let me explain about the theatre business
they stop the natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster
believe me to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre
so what do we do
strangely enough it all turns out well
i dont know
its a mystery
dumbly should i kill him mr
at this point din is heard in the background
a messenger ringing a bell is running though the street
the theatres are reopened
by order of the master of the revels the theatres are reopened fennyman is intrigued
tilney has opened the playhouses
yes i heard
henslowe plays his temporary advantage modestly shrugging himself free of lamberts grip
to lambert if you wouldnt mind henslowe continues on his way
fennyman watches henslowe curious
where is the play
oh its coming its coming
will is writing furiously
a burnt down candle is still alight although it is day outside the window
he has been writing all night
he has written about ten pages
pleased with himself and excited he gathers them up and leaves the room like a man with a mission
leaving the house pages in hand will nearly knocks down henslowe who has come to see him
the theatres are before he can finish will brandishes the pages in his hand
romeo and rosaline
god im good
you mean ethel
will has gone
burbage lives in another part of the city
will bangs through the door without ceremony
will enters and calls out
will charges into the bedroom
rosaline is in bed
the master of the revels is pulling up his breeches
will is shattered
tilney the unsuccessful snake bracelet glints at him from rosalines arm
like you i found him not at home
so this is the favour you find in the chamberlains men
to rosaline i would have made you immortal
turning to go tell burbage he has lost a new play by will shakespeare
what does burbage care of that
he is readying the curtain for kit marlowe
you have opened the playhouses
i have master shakespeare
but the plague sighs yes i know
but he was always hanging around the house
a bell can be heard ringing outside
to will leaving will
youre the only one will
in my heart
will emerges looking distraught
a burning brazier stands by the wall
will thrusts the pages into the coals
he watches for a moment as the pages catch fire
will walks in to find the place in an uproar of celebration
a handsome young serving man nol is bumping through with a tray of tankards
yes i heard
the theatres are open
but where is my playwright
henslowe finds a seat and takes a tankard off nols tray
chalk it up nol
im hungry too
the special today is a pigs foot marinated in juniper berry vinegar served with a buckwheat pancake which has been they are interrupted by will who joins them
he looks distracted
have you finished
he taps his forehead its all locked safe in here
we need ralph for the pirate king
good morning master nol
you will have a nice little part
nol shouts for you takes off his apron and flings it behind the bar
henslowe jumps up and embraces will
the entire staff and half the customers are now crowding around actors the lot of them
henslowe bangs the table to shut them all up
ned alleyn and the admirals men are out on tour
i need actors
those here who are unknown will have a chance to be known
what about the money mr
it wont cost you a penny
auditions in half an hour
the din of excited chatter returns
he sweeps grandly to the tavern door
where he meets ralph bashford a big burly middle aged actor
id have a part for you but alas i hear you are a drunkards drunkard
never when im working
will has remained behind aghast now at his predicament
he goes to the bar
give me to drink mandragora
straight up will
give my friend a beaker of your best brandy
will turns towards a figure further down the bar
its kit how goes it will
burbage says you have a play
and chinks to show for it
his drink arrives
will places a sovereign on the bar
i insist and a beaker for mr
the barman does the business
i hear you have a new play for the curtain
not new my doctor faustus
i love your early work
was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of ilium
i have a new one nearly done and better
the massacre at paris
romeo and ethel the pirates daughter
beat sighs despondently yes i know
what is the story
well theres a pirate confesses in truth i have not written a word
always in and out of love
yes thats good
until he meets ethel
do you think
the daughter of his enemy
thoughtfully the daughter of his enemy
his best friend is killed in a duel by ethels brother or something
his name is mercutio
nol hurries back to wills side
will theyre waiting for you
he drains his glass
good luck with yours kit
i thought your play was for burbage
this is a different one
trying to work it out a different one you havent written
will makes a helpless gesture and hurries after nol
henslowe and will are sitting in the gallery listening to a young actor auditioning
was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of ilium
sweet helen make me immortal with a kiss
henslowe and will look a bit deflated
the young actor leaves and is replaced by a second actor
i would like to give you something from faustus by christopher marlowe
was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of ilium
henslowe and will let him continue a bit further but exchange despairing looks
a succession of would be actors offer their version of marlowes lines each as inappropriate as the other
among them is a small urchin
the topless towers of ilium
sweet helen make me immortal with a
bellows thank you
the urchin leaves glowering furiously and is replaced by a beanpole of a man wasbash
wabash has a bad stutter
w w w w was th th this th th the f f f face
unexpectedly very good mr
report to the property master
will looks at henslowe in outrage
apologetically my tailor
wants to be an actor
i have a few debts here and there
well that seems to be everybody
did you see a romeo
i did not
well i to my work you to yours
when can i see pages
tomorrow henslowe leaves him
a prayer please god
will sits brooding alone for a moment
then he realizes he is being addressed from the stage
may i begin sir
will looks at the stage and sees a handsome young man with a hat shadowing his eyes
i would like to do a speech by a writer who commands the heart of every player
will can hardly manage a nod
what light is light if silvia be not seen what joy is joy if silvia be not by
unless it be to think that she is by and feed upon the shadow of perfection
it does not take four lines of valentines speech to confirm for us if confirmation be needed that thomas is viola
for will amazement at hearing his own words soon gives away to something else
he is captivated
he has found his romeo
except i be by silvia in the night there is no music in the nightingale
unless i look on silvia in the day there is no day for me to look upon
will interrupts him
take off your hat
where did you learn how to do that
are you mr
let me see you
take off your hat
thomas begins to panic
will jumps down to ground level
thomas runs offstage to wills bewilderment
will hurries after him
we go with will as he crosses the stage then backstage then into the retiring room which is crowded with actors and henslowes lieutenant property manager copier and general factotum
who is a new character peter
what are we playing
where are the pages
will enters into the middle of this
shouts wheres the boy
nobody knows what he is talking about
wabash the stutterer grabs wills hand and shakes it excitedly
b b b b break a l l l leg
the street door is swinging shut
will sees it
he fights his way through the men to get to the door
will emerges from the theatre into a street throbbing with nefarious life
whores cutpurses hawkers urchins tract sellers riffraff of all kinds in an area of stews lowdown pubs brothels and slums
it is some time before will spots thomas way ahead of him in the crowded street
the chase is taking them to the riverbank
when will gets to the riverbank he sees that thomas is in a smallish boat being rowed upriver and in midstream
the river is quite busy and among the boats there are a number of waiting taxis
will jumps into the nearest one and shouts at the taxi driver boatman
follow that boat
right you are governor
will sits in the stern of the boat and the boatman sits facing him rowing lustily
i know your face
are you an actor
oh god here we go again yes
yes ive seen you in something
that one about a king
i had the christopher marlowe in my boat once
the boatman is puffing
will is looking ahead to where thomass boat has reached a jetty on the farther shore a private jetty attached to a rich house on the north bank
will sees thomas jump out of his boat and run toward the house
do you know that house
sir robert de lesseps
will runs towards the house
thomas rushes up the back stairs removing his hat
her hair tumbles down about her shoulders so we will call her viola again
her mother lady de lesseps is talking to the nurse
where is she
our guests are upon us lord wessex too bargaining for a bride
my husband will have it settled tonight
behind her the door opens revealing viola as thomas to the nurses view but only for a moment
the door closes again as lady de lesseps turns
tomorrow he drags me off to the country and it will be three weeks gone before we return from our estates
a different door communicating to the next room opens and viola comes in after a lightning dress change into a robe
she curtseys to her mother
god save you mother
to nurse ho water nurse
the nurse looks at her round eyed
from a cauldron on the stove hot water is poured into two pails by the a kitchen boy under the nurses command
thomas kent sir
the actor who asks for him
will has come to the kitchen door with a letter
william shakespeare actor poet and playwright of the rose
the nurse sends the scullery maid back to work
master kent is
giving her the letter i will wait
much god may it do you
viola in her bath reads wills letter
the nurse is adding hot water to the tub
delighted he sees himself in me
romeo montague a young man of verona
unimpressed verona again
devouring the letter a comedy of quarreling families reconciled in the discovery of romeo to be the very same capulet cousin stolen from the cradle and fostered to manhood by
his montague mother that was robbed of her own child by the pirate king
will waits hopefully
the kitchen door opens and a servant flings a bucket of dirty water in the general direction of the gutter
will hops nimbly aside and escapes a soaking
the nurse is helping viola into her party dress
your mother and your father gaily from tomorrow away in the country for three weeks
is master shakespeare not handsome
he looks well enough for a mountebank
he would give thomas kent the life of viola de lessepss dreaming
firmly my lady this play will end badly
i will tell
twice as firmly you will not tell
as you love me and as i love you you will bind my breast and buy me a boys wig
will spots a gaggle of musicians approaching carrying instruments
will recognizes them
what business here
a five shilling business will
we play for the dancing
the sound of hooves gives hardly any warning as a galloping horseman thunders through the musicians who have to leap out of the way
it is wessex arriving at the house with his usual good manners
will watches wessex skid to a halt and enter the house
will has got in with the musicians
competently enough he strums along with them on the bandstand
two dozen guests are enough to crowd the space for dancing
will glances around looking for thomas kent
he stops a passing servant helping himself to a snack off the mans tray
musicians dont eat sir roberts orders
i seek master thomas kent
it means nothing to the servant who moves on
angle on wessex and sir robert
she is a beauty my lord as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg
my plantations in virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg
i have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a wessex
is she fertile
she will breed
if she do not send her back
is she obedient
as any mule in christendom
but if you are the man to rider her their are rubies in the saddlebag
i like her
angle on will watching the dancing
then he sees viola in the crowd
he turns to blood
love at first sight no doubt about it
viola has not seen him
she is doing a daughters duty among her parents friends
the guests form up to begin a changing partners dance the very same one you get in every romeo and juliet
to musician by all the stars in heaven who is she
viola de lesseps
dream on will
will leaves the bandstand and is moving trancelike to keep her in view between the dancers and onlookers
viola moves through patterns of the dance until
as night follows day she finds will opposite her
he has insinuated himself into the dance
master shakespeare will reacts surprised by her reaction
the dance separates them
viola finds herself opposite wessex
my lady viola
i have spoken with your father
so my lord
i speak with him every day
the dance separates them
viola finds herself opposite will again
will stares at her entranced
will has lost his tongue
i heard you are a poet
will nods in his trance and she smiles at him
but a poet of no words
will tries to speak but the silver tongue wont work
he is dumb with adoration
suddenly wessex takes him affably by the elbow and leads him into an alcove
smiling evilly poet
coming round form the anaesthetic and not noticing the danger i was a poet till now but i have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking
ravens at the tower
to his surprise he finds a lordly dagger at this throat
startled how do i offend my lord
by coveting my property
i cannot shed blood in her house but i will cut your throat anon
you have a name
gulps christopher marlowe at your service
wessex shoves him through the nearest door
violas eyes are searching the room for will
she finds wessex smiling at her
she looks away
there is a lighted window on the balcony
viola dressed for bed and the nurse pass across the lighted space
will is in the garden
he sees her
the light in the room is extinguished
then viola comes out onto the balcony in the moonlight
he watches her
viola sighs dreamily
a young man of verona
by william shakespeare
will reckons thats a good enough cue
he comes out of hiding and approaches the balcony
whispers my lady
gasps who is there
the nurse calls madam
from inside the room
anon good nurse
to will master shakespeare
the same alas
oh but why alas
a lowly player
alas indeed for i thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart
oh i am him too
the nurse calls again
to nurse anon anon
to will i will come again
she goes inside for a moment
to himself oh i am fortunes fool i will be punished for this
will comes forward again
oh my lady my love
if they find you here they will kill you
you can bring them with a word
oh not for the world
the nurse calls her again madam
but she goes inside
will looks around and sees that there is as ever a convenient tree
he starts to climb up toward the balcony
when his head is nearly level a soft figure comes once more onto the balcony
will pops his head over the parapet and is face to face with the nurse
the nurse gives a yell
will falls out of the tree
male voice shout to each other inside the house candle flames appear in different windows the garden door is flung open revealing sir robert with candelabra in one hand and
sword in the other
by this time will is on top of the garden wall and he drops safely out of sight
he could have written it better
will is burning the midnight oil literally and metaphorically
his quill has already covered a dozen sheets
he is inspired
it is day one
the company is on stage
peter is passing pages around a bunch of actors
john james and nol are looking through their pages
draw if you be men
to james gregory remember thy washing blow
part fools put up your swords
will is going around pumping hands and slapping shoulders flushed with excitement
henslowe is reading his pages worried
ralph bashford is next to him
it starts well and then its all long faced about some rosaline
wheres the comedy will
wheres the dog
to ralph do you think it is funny
i was a pirate king now im a nurse
thats funny will pulls henslowe aside
we are at least six men short and those we have will be overparted ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews
my romeo has let me down
i see disaster
we are at least four acts short will if you are looking for disaster
will as notices a young scruffy thirteen year old actor the urchin we met before
who are you master
i am ethel sir the pirates daughter
furiously ill be damned if you are
and he helps the urchin off with a kick
the urchin glowers with resentment
henslowe finds himself face to face with fennyman
is it going well
but nothing is happening
yes but very well
you are welcome
who is that
we are about to embark on a great voyage
it is customary to make a little speech on the first day
it does no harm and authors like it
you want to know what parts you are to receive
all will be settled as we go thats as far as he gets before there is a dramatic interruption the public entrance door is flung open and six men make
a loud entrance headed by ned alleyn the actor who is a handsome piratical figure with a big voice and a big sword
the admirals men are returned to the house
he gets various reactions
henslowe and will shout his name joyfully some of the actors are friends with the new group and behave accordingly others know they are out of a job
fennyman recovers or tries to
who is this
alleyn slaps him aside with his sword
roars silence you god
i am hieronimo
i am tamburlaine
i am faustus
i am barrabas the jew of malta of yes master will and i am henry vi
what is the play and what is my part
fennyman is impressed
a moment sir
roars who are you
bleating i am the money
then you may remain so long as you remain silent
pay attention and you will see how genius creates a legend
respectfully thank you sir
we are in desperate want of a mercutio ned a young nobleman of verona and the title of this piece
mercutio is it
i will play him
half a dozen of the admirals men will be given roles in our play and we meet them and identify them as will enthusiastically shakes hands
welcome george bryan
and now greeting sam gosse the female star of the admirals men sam
my pretty one
are you ready to fall in love again
hoarsely i am master shakespeare
concerned but your voice he thrust a hand between sams legs have they dropped
a girlie voice now no no a touch of cold only
we suspect he is lying but will has turned away
master henslowe you have your actors
he leaves passing by the humbled fennyman
i saw his tamburlaine you know
yes i saw it
of course it was mighty writing
there is no one like marlowe will is used to it
will arrives in a hurry at the wharfside and looks vainly in the direction of the de lessepses house no will looks down the alley no thomas
he turns away
the urchin the short lived ethel is sitting in the alley
better fortune boy
shrugs i was in a play
they cut my head off in titus andronicus
when i write plays they will be like titus
pleased you admire it
the urchin nods grimly
i like it when they cut heads off
and the daughter mutilated with knives
what is your name
here kitty kitty
because a stray cat is nearby
the cat show an interest
the urchin passes a white mouse to the cat and watches the result with sober interest
plenty of blood
that is the only writing
will backs away unnerved by the boy
wait youll see the cat bites his head off
i have to get back
the actors carry their parts
see where he comes
so please you step aside ill know his grievance or be much denied
i would thou wert so happy by thy stay to hear true shrift
come madam lets away
onstage montague and lady montague make their exit
offstage will appears next to henslowe
cut round him for now
not understanding what
the one who came with your letter
good morrow cousin
is the day so young
the voice is thomass
will turns back to the stage and sees him
today thomas has a wig as well as his small mustache
but new struck nine
ay me sad hours seem long
was that my father that went hence so fast
what sadness lengthens romeos hours
not having that which having makes them short
good in love
out of her favour where i am in love
interrupting no no no
dont spend it all at once
the rehearsal stops
do you understand me
he is speaking about a baggage we never even meet
what will be left in your purse when he meets his juliet
you mean ethel
rounding on him gods teeth am i to suffer this constant stream of interruption
to thomas what will you do in act two when he meets the love of his life
timidly looking through his few sheets of paper i am very sorry sir i have not seen act two
of course you have not
i have not written it
alone in the auditorium fennyman looks and listens fascinated
so this is theatre
go once more
ned alleyn comes out of the wings frowning over his manuscript
where is mercutio
tapping his forehead locked safe in here
i leave the scene in your safe keeping ned i have a sonnet to write
will moves back into the wings where henslowe is looking anxious
you mean a play
will moves on ignoring him
as he goes we see that viola is love struck by him a riot in the heart
viola still dressed as thomas sonnet in hand runs up the stairs to her room
from the other end of the house wessex can be heard ranting
lord wessex is being kept waiting
the nurse is bearing the brunt of his impatience
two hours at prayer
lady viola is pious my lord
piety is for sunday
and two hours at prayer is not piety it is self importance
it would be better that you return tomorrow my lord
it would be better that you tell her to get off her knees and show some civility to her six day lord and master
viola opens the door
she has changed hurriedly too hurriedly the effect of her glorious hair falling to her bare shoulders is spoiled by her mustache
fortunately the nurse spots her before wessex does and by coming forward to greet her the nurse manages to shield viola from view communicate the problem and announce wessexs presence
so that by the time the nurse has passed by viola and let herself out of the room the moustache has disappeared
my lady viola
you have been waiting
i am aware of it but it is beautys privilege
you flatter my lord
i have spoken to the queen
pause her majestys consent is requisite when a wessex takes a wife and once gained her consent is her command
do you intend to marry my lord
your father should keep you better informed
he has bought me for you
he returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from saturday
pause you are allowed to show your pleasure
i do not love you my lord
how your mind hops about
your father was a shopkeeper your children will bear arms and i will recover my fortune
that is the only matter under discussion today
you will like virginia
my fortune lies in my plantations
the tobacco weed
i need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work i fancy tobacco has a future
we will not stay there long three or four years
but why me
it was your eyes
no your lips
he kisses her with more passion than ceremony
viola recoils and slaps him
will you defy your father and your queen
the queen has consented
she wants to inspect you
at greenwich come sunday
be submissive modest grateful and brief
forced to submit i will do my duty my lord
she is writing to will
his letter poem is on her table
we can read part of it
shall i compare thee to a summers day
now we see what viola is writing
insert master will poet dearest to my heart i beseech you banish me from yours i am to marry lord wessex a daughters duty
she sheds a romantic unhappy tear
sam is now juliet
the play has evidently reached act i scene
we are witnessing the meeting of romeo and juliet in a simplified version of the changing partners dance we saw at violas house
ned alleyn is in charge
gentlemen upstage ladies downstage
the dance goes wrong
it is thomass fault
furious gentlemen upstage
are you a lady mr
thomas mutters a blushing apology
will arrives the bystanders clutching fresh pages
he gives these to peter
ned alleyn sees him and comes over to start an argument
preempting you did not like the speech
the speech is excellent
he does the first line impressively oh then i see queen mab hath been with you
excellent and a good length
but then he disappears for the length of a bible
will points significantly at the pages he has given there you have his duel a skirmish of words and swords such as i never wrote nor anyone
he dies with such passion and poetry as your ever heard a plague on both your houses
ned nods satisfied and turns back to work
then he turns back
but the author has escaped
up aloft will has a writers corner where he settle down to work
we see his private superstition he spins round in a circle rubs his hands together and spits on the floor
that done he picks up his pen
will is charging down a narrow alley and bumps into burbage who is emerging from the door of a tavern
will is in too much of a hurry to stop
burbage calls after him
and where are my pages
will hurries on
viola as thomas is being rowed across the river
from behind in the direction of bankside he hears shouting
shouting did you give her my letter
viola as thomas turns to see will some way behind following in another boat
she takes a letter from her coat and holds it aloft
calling and this for you
will has climbed aboard violas boat and is tearing open the letter
what he reads causes him great pain
he collapses into the stern seat next to viola
she has cut my strings
i am unmanned unmended and unmade like a puppet in a box
writer is he
will turns on him savagely row your boat
will turns back to viola
they have their conversation intimately disregarding the lack of intimacy
the boatman is hardly an arms length away but they ignore him
she tells me to keep away
she is to marry lord wessex
what should i do
if you love her you must do what she asks
and break her heart and mine
it is only ours you can know
she loves me thomas
does she say so
and yet she does where the ink has run with tears
was she weeping when she gave you this
her letter came to me by the nurse
catching up yes my aunt
but perhaps she wept a little
tell me how you love her will
like a sickness and its cure together
yes like rain and sun like cold and heat
collecting herself is your lady beautiful
since i came to visit from the country i have not seen her close
tell me is she beautiful
oh if i could write the beauty of her eyes
i was born to look in them and know myself
he is looking into violas eyes
she holds his look but will belies his words
and her lips
oh thomas her lips
the early morning rose would wither on the branch if it could feel envy
and her voice
like lark song
none of your twittering larks
i would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song
she sings too
and plays the lute she has a natural ear
and her bosom did i mention her bosom
glinting what of her bosom
oh thomas a pair of pippins
as round and rare as golden apples
i think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance
for what lady could live up to it close to when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine
besides can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a bankside poet and player
fervently yes by god
love knows nothing of rank or riverbank
it will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king and their love should be minded by each for love denied blights the soul we owe
so tell my lady william shakespeare waits for her in the garden
but what of lord wessex
for one kiss i would defy a thousand wessexes
the boat scrapes on the jetty of the de lessepses house
the bump throws thomas into wills arms
he holds her round the shoulders
his words have almost unmasked her
the closeness does the rest
she kisses him on the mouth and jumps out of the boat
she throws a coin to the boatman and runs towards the house
thank you my lady
viola de lesseps
known her since she was this high
wouldnt deceive a child
will gets out of the boat
reaching under his seat strangely enough im a bit of a writer myself
the boatman produces his memoirs in manuscript
it wouldnt take you long to read it i expect you know all the booksellers but will has gone
will drops over the wall into the garden and without hesitation starts climbing up to her balcony
will comes in through the window just as viola enters by the door
they stare at each other across the room
can you love a fool
can you love a player
they run together and fall into a passionate kiss
springs back wait
you are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as i was mistook in thomas kent
answer me only this are you the author of the plays of william shakespeare
then kiss me again for i am not mistook
they run together and fall into a passionate kiss
viola fumbles with his clothing he with hers
i do not know how to undress a man
it is strange to me too
the nurse has come to listen
she puts her ear against the door
because she hears muffled voices she looks startled
will is half naked
viola is down to her petticoat and chemise
the petticoat comes away
will flings it aside
he takes off her chemise
he is startled to find that she is tightly bandaged round the bosom
will finds the loose end and spins her naked
the nurse drags a chair a rocker outside the bedroom door and takes up her position
she sits down keeping guard
pretty soon there comes the regular creak of violas bed
the nurse fans herself furiously with her little lacy fan
she crosses herself
a chambermaid comes along the gallery outside the bedroom door
she is dusting her way along
the chambermaid becomes aware of the regular creaking
the nurse begins to rock in her chair keeping time with the creaking from within
the chambermaid stares at the nurse
the nurse stares at the chambermaid
go to go to
will and viola have finished making love and lie in each others arms
i would not have thought it
there is something better than a play
even your play
frowns oh and that was only my first try
well perhaps better than my first
he kisses her again dawn is breaking
the sun lacing the severing clouds with envious streaks
the nurse has fallen asleep in her rocking chair
a rooster crows at some distance
viola and will are in bed
she stirs drowsily
viola coming awake speaks his name and he kisses her
will then he starts to get out of bed
you would not leave me
look how pale the window
pulling him down moonlight
no the morning rooster woke me
it was the owl come to bed she is winning
she kisses him and pulls the bedclothes around them
giving in oh let henslowe wait
pausing pushing him away mr
persisting let him be damned for his pages
oh no no
kissing her there is time
it is still dark
it is broad day
the rooster crows again the rooster tells us so
it was the owl
believe me love it was the owl
he kisses her and starts to make love to her again
viola gives him a shove which pushes him onto the floor
she sits up and pulls on her gown
you would leave us players without a scene to read today
theres a knock at the door
the nurse is knocking
viola comes to the door
my lady the house is stirring it is a new day
viola looks beautified by the hours that have passed
it is a new world
the cut is to the middle of a rehearsal
we are coming up to the moment when romeo and juliet kiss for the first time act i scene v ned alleyn is in charge but will is watching
his life has turned perfect
have not saints lips and holy palmers too
ay pilgrim lips that they must use in prayer
oh then dear saint let lips do what hands to they pray grant thou lest faith turn to despair
will is in her eye line
her eyes flash an intimate secret look to him
saints do not move though grant for prayers sake
and viola misses her cue as a result
prompting her its you
roars suffering cats
viola guiltily picks up her line
then move not while my prayers effect i take
in character viola kisses sam demurely but apparently not demurely enough for will who gives a twitch
thus from my lips by thine my sin is purgd
then have my lips the sin that they have took
sin from my lips
oh trespass sweetly urgd
give me my sin again
viola kisses sam again
will gives a major twitch which in fact catapults his body onto the stage
everybody looks at him in surprise
not quite right
it is more let me as juliet then have my lips the sin that they have took
sin from my lips
oh trespass sweetly urgd
give me my sin again
viola kisses will
they lose themselves for a fraction of a moment
as viola withdraws her lips wills lips are going for it again
you kiss by th book
to will sarcastically well
it was lucky you were here
why do not i write the rest of your play while you apologising retreating yes yes
now the nurse
where is ralph
ralph has been ready and waiting
madam your mother craves a word with you
what is her mother
marry bachelor her mother is the lady of the house
will has retreated to he is behind the curtain now
and a good lady and wise and virtuous
i nurse her daughter that you talkd withal
during ralphs lines which are continuous will stands in the shadow behind the curtain alone agitated
i tell you he that can lay hold of her he makes the money sign shall have the chinks
is she a capulet oh dear account
my life is my foes debt
nol as benvolio at a party carrying a goblet tipsy enters the scene
to romeo away be gone the sport is at best
viola about to make her exit has her hand holding the curtain at the gap
will is kissing her hand
ay so i fear the more is my unrest
viola comes through the curtain
will and viola kiss dangerously they are in a narrow space hidden from the general backstage area
come hither nurse
what is yond gentleman
to will oh let it be night
i know not
go ask his name if he be married my grave is like to be my wedding bed
juliets line bits will between the eyes
will pulls away
oh do not go i must
i must as will races up the ladder to his writers corner the rehearsal can be heard continuing
his name is romeo and a montague the only son of your great enemy
roaring from the audience terrible
will arrives at the top of the building in his writers corner
he spins around once in a circle rubs his hands together and spits on the floor
his manuscript is all over the table
we take a peak at the lines he has already written
insert manuscript but soft what light through yonder window breaks
it is the east and juliet is the sun
violas voice over speaks the line
but soft what light through yonder window breaks
it is the east and juliet is the sun
reading arise fair sun and kill the envious moon who is already sick and pale with grief that thou her maid art far more fair than she
viola is in bed reading the lines from the manuscript page
will is in bed with her reading with her
yes some of it is speakable
she has to speak through wills kisses he is nibbling at her neck and shoulders and she has to bat him away with the pages
continuing reading it is my lady o it is my love
o that she knew she were
viola continues the speech edge to edge now in rehearsal with sam as juliet sighing on the balcony above her
the brightness of her cheek would shame those stars as daylight doth a lamp
her eyes in heaven would through the airy region stream so bright that birds would sing and think it were not night
see how she leans her cheek upon her hand
o that i were a glove upon that hand that i might touch that cheek
above ay me
oh speak again bright angel
we have abandoned real time
the scene continues cross cut between the stage and violas bed
reading through violas kisses oh romeo romeo wherefore art thou romeo
deny thy father and refuse thy name
or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love and ill no longer be a capulet
below shall i hear more or shall i speak at this
will and viola in bed
what man art thou that thus bescreend in night so stumblest on my counsel
its become late and the rehearsal is continuing by torchlight
by a name i know not how to tell thee who i am my name dear saint is hateful to myself because it is an enemy to thee
we see that a group of the other actors have drifted out front drawn by the scene
fennyman is there entranced
clearly this stuff is a cut above the normal
will undressed strides around the room feeding juliets lines to viola in bed
the orchard walls are high and hard to climb and the place death considering who thou art if any of my kinsmen find thee here
if they do see thee they will murder thee
alack there lies more peril in thine eye than twenty of their swords
look thou but sweet and i am proof against their enmity
i would not for the world
i have nights cloak to hide me from their eyes and but thou love me let them find me here
will and viola are both out of bed halfway though dressing
good night good night
as sweet repose and rest come to thy heart as that within my breast
o wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied
thats my line
oh but it is mine too
o wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied
what satisfaction canst thou have tonight
the exchange of thy loves faithful vow for mine
will and viola are back on the bed kissing and making love
my bounty is as boundless as the sea my love as deep continuing the speech with him the more i give to thee the more i have for both are
outside the nurse is knocking on the door and calling
i hear some noise within
dear love adieu
ralph the nurse calls juliet
calling to the nurse who is outside anon good nurse the nurse listens at the door
anon good nurse sweet montague be true
stay but a little i will come again
viola slaps him playfully for his vulgarity and then kisses him
stay but a little i will come again
sam leaves the balcony through the curtain
oh blessed blessed night
it is night
they have just made love
suddenly it is very still
almost to herself i am feared being in night all this but a dream too flattering sweet to be substantial
onstage the scene continues
backstage ned alleyn is working his way upstairs
he passes by ralph the nurse who has a couple of words of as it were in juliets chamber
all my fortunes at thy foot ill lay and follow thee my lord throughout the world
i come anon but if thou meanest not well i do beseech thee madam
by and by i come to cease thy strife and leave me to my grief
a thousand times good night
sam exits i
enters to us through the curtain
to ned i cannot move in this dress
and it makes me look like a pig
i have no neck in this pig dress
and then hearing his cue from romeo oh shes off again
she says shes going and then she doesnt ned is arriving
will is busy writing
peter is there holding the pages will has completed and waiting for will to finish his page
peter is reading his pages
will sees ned arrive
he gives his page to peter
to peter how is it
shrugs its all right
says wills face
peter departs leaving the field to ned
will braces himself
i know its good
oh the title wont do
ah romeo and juliet just a suggestion
thank you ned
the whole exchange is in ironic code between old soldiers
ned nods curtly and turns to descend
you are a gentleman
and you are a warwickshire shit house
peter is just handing the pages henslowe in the auditorium
henslowe has acquired a performing dog
the dog does somersaults tirelessly
as peter hands over the pages he shakes his head
in disbelief you mean no dog of any kind
fennyman the born again theatre groupie shushes henslowe and looks daggers at him
to henslowe the friar married them in secret then ned gets into a fight with one of the capulets romeo tries to stop them he gets in neds way i
mean in mercutios way so tybalt kills mercutio and then romeo kills tybalt
then the prince banishes him from verona
much relieved that must be when he goes on the voyage and gets shipwrecked on the island of the pirate king
fennyman cant hear it
he storms over
kicks the dog roars at henslowe
cease your prattling
to the stage where the action has paused a thousand apologies
good night good night
parting is such sweet sorrow that i shall say good night till it be morrow
a sunbeam wakes the lovers
viola wakes with a start
something is bothering her she cant think what
will calms her
it is sunday
he brings her back down to the pillow
i found something in my sleep
the friar who married them will take up their destinies
oh but it will end well for love
in heaven perhaps
it is not a comedy i am writing now
a broad river divides my lovers family duty fate as unchangeable as nature
sobered yes this is not life will
this is a stolen season
suddenly there is a great racket heard from downstairs
a man shouting
where is she
be patient my lord she is dressing
will you ask her majesty to be patient
she jumps up and gives a cry
the nurse is barring the stairs to wessex
now pay attention nursy
the queen gloriana regina gods chosen vessel the radiant one who shines her light on us is at greenwich today and prepared during the evenings festivities to bestow her gracious
favour on my choice of wife and if were late for lunch the old boot will not forgive
so you get you to my ladys chamber and produce her with or without her undergarments
viola has her dress on and is putting on her shoes
will in his underwear is in mid argument
not for the queen herself
what will you have me do
marry you instead
brought up short to be the wife of a poor player
can i wish that for lady viola except in my dreams
and yet i would if i were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day
tartly you follow your desire freely enough in the night
so if that is all to greenwich i go
then i will go with you
you cannot wessex will kill you i know how to fight
now fixing her hair stage fighting
turn to him oh will
as thomas kent my heart belongs to you but as viola the river divides us and i will marry wessex a week from saturday
the ranting from wessex has continued ranting by heaven i will drag her down by the queens command and is cut off short as violas door opens at the top
of the stairs
good morning my lord
impressed by her appearance ah
the tide waits for no man but i swear it would wait for you
viola comes down the stairs
behind her will appears gowned and bonneted
he has also assumed a country accent
here we come at last my lord
taken aback are you bringing your laundry woman
my ladys country cousin
arriving with a curtsey my but you be a handsome gallant just as she said
you may call me miss wilhelmina
on a more fortuitous occasion perhaps oh my lord you will not shake me off she never needed me more i sear by your breeches
fireworks explode in the evening sky over greenwich a royal palace crowded now with noble guests
the way these royal routs work is that guest mill about chatting bowing and generally behaving gallantly while queen elizabeth creates a vortex around her as she passes through the
throng occasionally honouring somebody with a couple of words until she arrives thankfully at the best chair
where she establishes a headquarters
her current lord in waiting ferries the lucky few forward to a brief audience with the queen each giving way to the next
viola and wessex are respectively dipping and bowing as they are greeted by people who know them
will in close attendance joins in gratuitously bowing until viola nudges him and reminds him to curtsey instead
the queens lord in waiting plucks wessexs sleeve
to him now
to viola the queen asks for you
the lord in waiting ushers viola through the crowd
will starts to follow
wessex takes him by the arm
is there a man
a man my lord
impatiently there was a man poet a theatre poet i heard does he come to the house
a theatre poet
an insolent penny a page rogue marlowe he said christopher marlowe has he been to the house
oh yes he is the one lovely waistcoat shame about the poetry
venomously that dog
angle on the queen
the lord in waiting has presented viola
viola speaks from a frozen curtsey
stand up straight girl
the queen examines her
i have seen you
you are the one who comes to all the plays at whitehall at richmond
agreeing your majesty
what do you love so much
your majesty speak out
i know who i am
do you love stories of kings and queens
feats of arms
or is it courtly love
i love theatre
to have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed interrupting they are not acted for you they are acted for me
viola remains silent in apology
angle on will
he is watching and listening
he has never seen the queen so close
he is fascinated
and i love poetry above all
above lord wessex
she looks over violas shoulder and viola realises wessex has moved up behind her
to wessex my lord when you cannot find your wife you had better look for her at the playhouse
the courtiers titter at her pleasantry
but playwrights teach nothing about love they make it pretty they make it comical or they make it lust
they cannot make it true
blurts oh but they can
she has forgotten herself
the courtiers gasp
the queen considers her
wessex looks furious
will is touched
your majesty they do not they have not but i believe there is one who can lady viola is
young in the world
your majesty is wise in it
nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting
ill wager my fortune
i thought you were here because you had none
wessex could kill somebody
by way of dismissing him well no one will take your wager it seems
shock and horror
queen elizabeth is the only person amused
a very worthy sum on a very worthy question
can a play show us the very truth and nature of love
i bear witness to the wager and will be the judge of it as occasion arises
which wins a scatter of applause
she gathers her skirts and stands i have not seen anything to settle it yet
she moves away everybody bowing and scraping so the fireworks will be soothing after the excitements of lady violas audience
and now she is next to wessex who is bowing low
intimately to him have her then but you are a lordly fool
she has been plucked since i saw her last and not by you
it takes a woman to know it
the queen passes by and as wessex comes vertical again we see his face a mask of furious realisation
to himself marlowe
christopher marlowe shuts the door behind him
above him the ceiling creaks to the rhythm of copulation
he has a sheaf of manuscript pages in his hand
he goes to the stairs
the creaking stops
marlowe enters ignoring the situation on the bed where rosaline is astride burbage
you are playing my faustus this afternoon
dont spend yourself in sport
working hard this afternoon
well still be here this afternoon
what do you want kit
my massacre at paris is complete
you have the last act
you have the money
leaving then tomorrow you will have the pages
to rosaline will you desist
twenty pounds on delivery what is money to me like us
besides if i need a play i have another waiting a comedy by shakespeare
he gave it to henslowe
well i am to deptford now i leave my respects miss rosaline
i gave shakespeare two sovereigns for romeo
leaving you did
but ned alleyn and the admirals men have the playing of it as the rose
burbage rouses himself violently throwing rosaline off the bed
the glass bracelet is flung from her wrist
it breaks on the floor releasing a strip of paper
burbage picks it up
what he reads on it does not please him it is wills signature
traitor and thief
burbage and a solid wedge of the chamberlains mend are cleaving a path through the crowds
their faces are grim
we are in act iii scene i
ned alleyn as mercutio and nol as benvolio and two montague sidekicks are in occupation of the stage when the capulets swagger in four of them headed by james hemmings
by my head here comes the capulets
by my heel i care not
follow me close for i will speak to them
with bombast to mercutio gentlemen good een a word with one of you
ned comes out of character
are you going to do it like that
and before the humbled actor can reply ned continues
and but one word with one of us
couple it with something make it a word and a blow
but suddenly six more men and a dog invade the stage ready to fight
burbage and the chamberlains men have arrived to avenge burbages honour with swords clubs and a bucket containing pig swill
where is that thieving hack who cant keep his pen in his own ink pot
will has already leapt up onto the stage
what is this rabble
burbage aims a blow at will who ducks and grabs a stave from the nearest actor and parries the blow
he swings at burbage a chamberlains man swings at will thomas cries out someone else slashes the stage hangings bringing down the drapes and in a moment the admirals men
and the chamberlains men using their much rehearsed skills are brawling with weapons and fist using everything short of unbuttoned rapiers
crab the dog is yapping and snapping at any legs he can reach
henslowe a little slow to catch up on the situation checks the page in his hand
fennyman much slower to catch up watches enthralled
to henslowe wonderful wonderful
and a dog
but now henslowe has worked out that these actors dont belong nor does the scene
he enters the fray but his interest is protecting his property
big burly ralph is using a couple of unlit torches as weapons he breaks one of them over an enemys back and henslowe turns on ralph not with my props
viola is doing well enough tripping up an enemy with a well judged stave and then using it to deflect a blow aimed at will will
a literary feud
then he is smashed over the head
he falls off the stage taking viola with him
under the stage is a space known as hell and will shoves viola into this space
he gets back onto the stage where the goings on are worthy of the four musketeers and robin hood combined with sam gosse dressed as juliet fighting with the best
there is a stack of cushions stored for the expensive seats and as the stack s knocked over ned alleyn and others grab cushions to use as shields
soon cushions are being ripped and the air is full of flying feathers
the trap door in the stage opens violas head pops up
she looks around and surrounded by milling legs and floating feathers a boot catches her sideways and half knocks her wig off
in danger of having her cover blown she ducks down again leaving the trap open just nicely for will to plummet down it
i dreamed last night of a shipwreck
you were cast ashore in a far country
they embrace and kiss
in a moment they are in a world of their own
the battle rages
fennyman alone now in the auditorium continues to watch entranced
its the greatest show hes ever seen
henslowe is desperately trying to rescue odd props that have been seconded to the fight
someone picks up a tree that is to be used in romeo
we need that for the balcony scene
fennyman notices this and it rings a distant bell
he looks around the realises that some of these faces are unfamiliar
the tree comes crashing down on ralphs head
fennyman looks at henslowe
in despair my poor rose
he collapses on to a broken bench
fennyman comes over to him grabs the script pages from his pocket and consults them to confirm what he has now begun to suspect that this scene is not in
horrified my investment
lambert has been sleeping peacefully through this but wakes to his masters call
points at the fray henslowe attempts to intervene
i want no more trouble mr
as i explained to you the theatre business henslowe you pound of tripe in my business i would be out of business if i had your courage so dont tell
me about business and he delivers a telling blow to a passing chamberlains man who wheels off the stage
lambert meanwhile is making short work of the rest of the opposition receiving help with the thorny business of identification from sam
stray members of the chamberlains men are running from the theatre as burbage fighting a heroic last stand is tipped backwards by fennyman off the stage and into a bucket
then ned starts applauding
the others weary from fighting start applauding too from all levels of the theatre
fennyman looks around starting to beam as a din of encores and bravos engulf him
the victorious army of actors bursts into the brothel fennyman at their head
he owns the brothel
the place is already crowded with whores and customers
its a party
shouts a famous victory
kegs and legs
open and on the house
oh what happy hour
and grabbing a raddled poxy pol
you keep yourself to yourself ill not have you infecting my investment
looking around guardedly
to is this a tavern
it is also a tavern
will sits her down in the company and takes the chair next to her a pretty whore immediately sits on wills knee and kisses him
i remember you
viola furiously pulls the pretty whore off wills lap
one at a time one at a time
to viola oh hes a pretty one
tell me your story while i tickle your fancy
its its oh its a house of ill repute
it is thomas but of good reputation
come there is no harm in a drink
glasses are shoved into their hands
everyone has a glass
except ralph declining the glass never when im working
the pretty whore has turned her attention to sam
sam looks uncomfortable never tried it
groping him i think you are ready sam
fennyman shouts a toast
raising his glass you are welcome to my best house
heres to the admirals men
viola drinks too
she decides too
she decides to enjoy it
she bangs down her glass
shouts the admirals men
will toasts with her
he sees that she feels one of the a figure is running desperately through the streets
he comes into the square and runs towards the rose
half the company are singing
nol and a whore are tumbling down the stairs together
he is without his trousers
an awful lot of drink has gone down
to the prettiest whore i
quite liked it
viola bright eyed is banging her glass on the table in time to a song which is being drunkenly delivered by a barbershop quartet of actors
fennyman reels into viola
you have not dipped your wick
baffled my wick
saving her mr
fennyman because you love the theatre you must have a part in my play
i am writing an apothecary a small but vital role
embracing will by heaven i thank you
i will be your apothecary
in his general enthusiasm he embraces the next man who is ralph stone cold sober
i am to be in your play
to ralph and what is this play about
well theres this nurse fennyman beside himself shouts for silence announcing mr
shakespeare has given me the part of the apothecary
will what is the story
where is the shipwreck
how does the comedy end
by god i wish i knew
by god will if you do not who does
let us have pirates clowns and a happy ending or we will send you back to stratford to your wife
that goes down every well with the entire company
except for viola and will
he looks at her helplessly then makes as if to say something
viola ducks away from him and blunders blindly out of the street door in tears
viola passes peter who is coming in from the street
will attempting to follow viola is grabbed round the shoulders by peter
who we now see is in a highly emotional state
will tries to fight him off but peter has the strength of the news he brings
he brings the room to silence
a black day for us all
there is news come up river from deptford
marlowe is dead
there are general gasps and cries for information
stabbed to death in a tavern at deptford
no one is more affected than will
this second blow is worse than the first
he stands horror stricken
what have i done
standing up he was the first man among us
a great light has gone out
will comes staggering out into the street
it was i who killed him
god forgive me god forgive me
he falls into a stagnant puddle a deep gutter of water and garbage
he gets up and staggers on
a church tower looms up in the night sky
this is where will has come
the church is empty but for the demented grieving figure of shakespeare kneeling praying weeping banging his head in his private purgatory dimly lit by tallow candles gazed upon by
effigies of the dead and images of his redeemer
he is wet bedraggled weeds and leaves in his hair
a lovely sunny morning
the church bells are ringing
viola and the nurse mounted approach
viola rides sidesaddle on a beautiful horse and is followed rather like quixote by sancho by the nurse on a less impressive animal
riding in the opposite direction is wessex
and what a happy day it is
he sings and hums to himself merrily
here is a man who has heard wonderful news
he sees viola and greets her merrily
you look sad my lady
let me take you riding
it is not my riding day my lord
bless me i thought it was a horse
i am going to church
recomposing his features to solemnity i understand of course
it is to be expected
it is to be expected on a sunday
and on a day of mourning
i never met the fellow but once at your house
cannot take this in mourning
who is dead my lord
dear god i did not think it would be me to tell you
a great loss to playwriting and to dancing
viola almost faints
the nurse steadies her
faintly he is dead
cheerfully solemn killed last night in a tavern
come then well say a prayer for his soul viola gives a silent cry
the nurse is speaking to her in distress
now is the time to show your breeding
the nurse is holding viola up as they enter the church
viola seems catatonic
the nurse lowers her onto a seat and sits down next to her
as they sit the choir enters singing
wessex who is sitting in the next pew looks about him with interest
he hasnt been in a church for years
what he sees turns him to jelly
he sees will shakespeare
angle on will
will is a spectral bedraggled figure backlit by a great shaft of light he would look like a ghost at the best of times and this is the worst
bleeding from where he has banged his head bedraggled and ravaged by the night he stands in a side chapel staring at wessex
wessex gasps and sweats and sees will raise a quivering accusatory finger at him
he starts to mumble
oh spare me dear ghost spare me for the love of christ
now viola sees will
she is still paralysed and seems at first unable to take him in
she watches with detachment as wessex starts to back out of the church finally running in terror
screaming spare me
the choir continues to sing but the scream brings viola to her senses and she runs to a side door where will is leaving
outside viola sees will staggering away from the church
she calls his name
he does not answer
she runs after him
oh my love i thought you were dead
she claps him to her
they told each other for a moment then will pulls back
it is worse
i have killed a man
violas horse grazes
will lies on his back still sobered and full of guilt
viola sits on the grass among the buttercups and looks down at him
viola is plaiting a finger ring from stems of grass
she has not yet revealed her feelings
marlowes touch was in my titus andronicus and my henry vi was a house built on his foundations
you never spoke so well of him
he was not dead before
i would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come
will turns to look at her
you lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed
my love is no lie
i have a wife yes and i cannot marry the daughter of sir robert de lesseps
it needed no wife come from stratford to tell you that
and yet you let me come to your bed
i loved the writer and gave up the prize for a sonnet
i was the more deceived
yes you were deceived
for i never loved you till now
declaring herself i love you will beyond poetry
oh my love he kisses her you ran from me before
you were not dead before
when i thought you dead i did not care about all the plays that will never come only that i would never see your face
i saw our end and it will come
you cannot marry wessex
if not wessex the queen will know the cause and there will be no more will shakespeare
they kiss again passionately
through his kisses but i will go to wessex as a widow from these vows as solemn as they are unsanctified
and as their desperate kisses turn into lovemaking we cut to he is mid speech for killing juliets kinsman tybalt the one who killed romeos friend mercutio romeo is banished
he is on the stage of the rose
the entire company is assembled henslowe and fennyman included holding pages of manuscript which they are sharing together examining the separated pages passing pages to each other etc
wills mood is intense and focused
but the friar who married romeo and juliet is that me
the friar who married them gives juliet a potion to drink
it is a secret potion
it makes her seeming dead
she is placed in the tomb of the capulets
she will awake to life and love when romeo comes to her side again
the company murmurs approval
i have not said all
by malign fate the message goes astray which would tell romeo of the friars plan
he hears only that juliet is dead
and thus he goes to the apothecary
and buys a deadly poison
he enters the tomb to say farewell to juliet who lies there cold as death
he drinks the poison
he dies by her side
and then she wakes and sees him dead
henslowe is fascinated and appalled
and so juliet takes his dagger and kills herself
will is staring at viola well that will have them rolling in the aisles
sad and wonderful
i have a blue velvet cap which will do well i have seen apothecary with a cap just so
to will yes it will serve
but theres a scene missing between marriage and death
will is still staring at viola
aware suddenly of the others watching she breaks his gaze and drops her head
will looks at ned
will and viola
viola dressed as thomas
he has present for her a neatly written manuscript of his play on sheets folded to octavo size
all written out for you
i had the clerk at bridewell do it he has a good fist for lettering
she wants to accept the present with joy but something in his mood restrains her
theres a new scene he turns the pages and shows her
will you read it for me
he knows it wilt thou be gone
it is not yet near day it was the nightingale and not the lark that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear
nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree
believe me love it was the nightingale
reading it was the lark the herald of the morn no nightingale
look love what envious streaks do lace the severing clouds in yonder east
nights candles are burnt out and jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops
i must be gone and live or stay and die
the words of the scene become wills and violas their way of saying the farewells they cannot utter
yon light is not daylight i know it i
it is some meteor that the sun exhales to be to thee this night a torchbearer
but the scene is continuing with viola dressed as thomas
somewhere behind and up above the stage in a deserted corner among rigging bits of scenery etc
they speak the lines and we hardly know ourselves whether it is rehearsal or lovemaking
but after a few moments it is definitely lovemaking
their clothes start coming away their words interrupted by kisses
thou needst not to be gone
i have more care to stay than will to go
come death and welcome
juliet wills it so
how ist my soul
it is not day
by now her loosened bosom bandage has been pulled away and will passionately embraces her nakedness
and into this heaving composition comes a little white mouse unseen my them climbing through a knot hole in the planking behind violas head
an adjacent knot hole reveals a human eye and we do not need to be told it is john websters
webster takes his eye away from the peephole and frowns thinking it out
tilney puts a coin in websters hand
you will go far i fear
i hope we work together again
tilney walks away
a man is pacing up and down in a sort of agony
he is muttering
he is glancing at a sheet of paper
he is fennyman rehearsing the important role of the apothecary for which he has a special voice
such mortal drugs i have but mantuas law is death to any he that utters them
put this in any liquid thing you will and
something he has dried up
he curses the terror and despair
such mortal drugs i have
what is it
what is it
he is so wrapped up in all this that he simply does not notice when wessex rides up to the main entrance dismounts and walks inside
onstage the rehearsal continues
wessex strides in
among the audience are henslowe a few actors
and john webster
who sees wessex and jumps up and goes to him
wessex knocks him aside and continues
you upstart inky pup
now i will show you your place which is in hell
you are on my ground
drawing his sword by god ill fight the lot of you will draws his sword
i am more than enough
she almost gives herself away
but the fight has started
wessex slashes at will
will knows how to fight
he parries and thrusts
wessex is surprised
the fight goes fast and furious around the stage until will thrusts accurately at wessexs chest
and would have killed him but for the button on his sword point
wessex grapples with him and now it becomes a parody of the hamlet duel wessexs unbuttoned sword falls to the ground will puts his foot on it tosses wessex his
own safe sword picks up wessexs sword and continues the fight until he has wessex at his mercy
will has fought with a passionate rage that has everybody staring at him
now the look in his eyes is merciless
to the assembly this is the murderer of kit marlowe
ned alleyn comes forward looking worried and dubious
will i rejoiced at his death because i thought it was yours
that is all i know of marlowe
its true will it was a tavern brawl
marlowe attacked and got his own knife in the eye
a quarrel about the bill the bill
oh vanity vanity
not the billing the bill
will steps back and sinks to his knees
his relief could not be greater
to the heavens oh god i am free of it
wessex gets to his feet
tilney enters the auditorium from the public entrance
my lord wessex
foaming close it
take it down stone by stone
i want it ploughed into the ground and sown with quick lime
wessex storms out past the bewildered tilney
tilney what is this
sedition and indecency
master of the revels sir over here sir
to webster where boy
points i saw her bubbies
shocked and gratified a woman on the stage
i swear it
the company of actors are dumbstruck
none more than so henslowe
i say this theatre is closed
on the authority of the powers invested in my by the court i close this theatre
triumphantly for lewdness and unshamefacedness
for displaying a female on the public stage
tilney is unstoppable
he jumps on the stage
and seizes sam gosse
before webster or anyone can intervene tilney pulls up his skirt ignoring sams rather gutteral yell of protest and pulls down sams drawers
tilneys face is a study
so is everybody elses
webster rolls his eyes oh these stupid grown ups
and deftly throws one of his mice onto romeos hair
viola gives a shrill scream the startled mouse descends her neck via violas ear and seeks an entry into her collar
by which time viola has gone berserk and torn off her wig
her hair is pinned up but there is no question her gender
will is paralysed
viola gives him a look of terrible despair and apology
pointing at sam not him
pointing at viola her
hes a woman
by now the scene is playing to a crowded theatre or so it seems
thats who i meant
this theatre is closed
notice will be posted
sam has picked himself up and his drawers
to ned ned i swear i knew nothing of this
hoping to protect will nobody knew
pointing at will he did
i saw him kissing her bubbies
everybody looks at will who stares at viola helpless
closed mark you henslowe
tilney turns on his heel and leaves in triumph
the company is still polaxed
in despair it is over
i am so sorry mr
i wanted to be an actor
she turns to will i am sorry will
will shakes his head
this cannot be the end
viola walks away leaving by the public entrance
they all let her go watching her silently
as she passes wabash y y y you w w w were w w w w wonderful
as she is leaving will comes to life
he starts off towards her
but his progress is halted by a sock to the jaw from ned alleyn
will falls down in the dust
fennyman enters still bent over his sheet of paper mumbling his precious lines
when he reaches the groundlings yard he finds to his surprise the whole company is standing about in attitudes of despair or worse
fennyman looks around
everything all right
the closure notice is nailed to the door
viola in her nightdress is reading by candlelight
she is reading her private manuscript of romeo and juliet
next to her is a tray of covered dishes
the nurse enters and looks at her sympathetically
she lifts the tray
she realises it is heavy
she puts it down and raises the covers and sees that viola has eaten nothing
she looks at violas tears but there is nothing to be said
they are all there the admirals men including will and henslowe drowning their sorrows
everyone is drunk
fennyman is also there taking the disaster somewhat selfishly
muttering i would have been good
i would have been great
he hands a flask to ralph who is in a similar mood
so would i
we both would
ralph contemplates the flask and since hes not working takes a swig
a moment later he keels over rigid as a pole
the street door crashes open
behind him enter a solid wedge of the chamberlains men sober faced several with black eyes and bandages round their heads
lambert fennymans henchman and killer puts down his tankard and comes forward casually kicking chairs and tables out of his way
lambert reaches up to the wall over the bar and takes down once of the ceremonial weapons hanging there a battle axe
but burbage has flintlock pistol stuck into his sash
burbage draws and the pistol roars shooting flame lambert curses drops the axe nurses his wounded hand
burbage puts the pistol back into his sash
ned alleyn is half drunk at a table
he staggers to his feet
he faces well burbage you never did know when your scene was over
that can wait
the master of the revels despises us for vagrants tinkers and peddlers of bombast
but my father james burbage had the first licence to make a company of players from her majesty and he drew from poets the literature of the age
their fame will be our fame
so let them all know we are men of parts
we are a brotherhood and we will be a profession
will shakespeare has a play
i have a theatre
the curtain is yours
a strong wind is blowing through the trees
a boy with a paste pot and a bundle of flyers is having trouble pasting a flyer on the wall of the building
a gust of wind scatters the bundle and sends a couple of dozen flyers flying into the sky
the boy with the paste pot runs around trying to recover those he can
we look at the poster
it says with mr
fennyman as the apothecary will comes out of the theatre and passes the poster
he walks on without looking at it
a voice calls after him will
will does not turn to look at him
well be needing a romeo will carries on walking
will is pushing through the crowds on his way to the river
the nurse is helping viola to dress in a wedding dress
the nurse is in tears
viola submits to the task impassively
will is climbing down the ladder to the waiting boats
wessex dressed to be a bridegroom is concluding his negotiations with de lesseps while lady de lesseps weeps
de lesseps is signing papers
there is a money chest too
my ship is moored at bankside bound for virginia on the afternoon tide please do not weep lady de lesseps you are gaining a colony
and you are gaining five thousand pounds my lord
by these drafts in my hand
would you oblige me with fifty or so in gold
just to settle my accounts at the dockside
de lesseps sighs and unlocks his money chest
wessex places his empty purse on the desk
look she comes
viola has appeared at the top of the stairs with the good morning my lord
i see you are open for business so lets to church
will is running across the grass towards the house
as he crosses the bridge over the moat a carriage bears down on him and he has to flatten himself against the wall of the gatehouse as the carriage passes
taking wessex and his bride to church
wills face as he watches the carriage disappear
distant bells begin to peal the bells announce the completion of the marriage as wessex and the new lady wessex leave the church
violas veil is flying in the wind and beneath it we can just see violas unhappy face
the de lesseps family entourage is applauding
wessex beams with satisfaction
suddenly the sky and the wind deliver a message a flyer from the curtain slaps against wessexs face
he claws at it and tries to throw it away
the wind delivers it to violas bosom
she takes it up and reads it
and passes it to the nurse
wessex descends the steps to where the curtained carriage awaits the bride and groom
he gallantly holds the door for viola to enter
she climbs aboard
wessex makes to follow her
the nurse grasps him in a moving embrace to wessexs discomfort
be good to her my lord
he tries to disengage
she wont have it
god bless you
let go theres a good nurse
after a couple of further attempts wessex extricates himself
the tide will not wait
wessex pulls aside the curtain and gets in
it takes a moment for wessex to realise he is alone in there
he looks around but viola has fled
hundreds of people are converging on the theatre
among them is the puritan makepeace vainly exhorting the crowds to run away from sin licentiousness is made a show vice is made a show vanity and pride likewise made
this is the very business of show but makepeace is being carried inexorably through the main doors of the theatre
the admirals men are all in costume and are in a buzz of nervous excitement
alleyn dressed for mercutio is giving last minute instructions to peter
james and john hemmings are arguing about the timing of their entrance
fennyman in his apothecarys cap is agonising over his lines
wabash is stuttering over his
alone in his dejection in the midst of all this is will dressed for fennyman approaches him apothecarys cap in hand
is this all right
will nods miserable
sam has found a private corner
he is gargling into a basin
he looks worried and furtive
the audience is gathering
word has got around
even rich people are coming
they arrive by carriage and by palanquin
some of them are cloaked and hooded slumming incognito
a cannon booms from the curtain
the flag of the admirals men flutters above
lambert and frees are taking the entrance money
the auditorium is now packed
among them sheepish is everything is ready
ned signals the musicians
trumpets and drums sound
the house falls silent
wabash seems to be important at the beginning
we have never been told what part he plays
he is still muttering lines and stuttering them
mutter t t t two h h households b both alike in d d d dignity
will listens to him in agony
he finds henslowe next to him
to henslowe we are lost
no it will turn out well
how will it
i dont know its a mystery
and off we go
henslowe claps wabash on the shoulder and sends him through the curtain
angle on wabash the audience waits expectantly
wabash gathers himself
t t t t two will shuts his eyes and prays
wabash launches himself into a perfect audacious delivery like a star
household both alike in dignity in fair verona where we lay our scene from ancient grudge break to new mutiny where civil blood makes civil hands unclean
from forth the fatal loins of these two foes a pair of star crossd lovers take their life whose misadventured piteous overthrows doth with their death bury their parents strife
viola and the nurse hurrying toward the curtain
hemmings brothers are ready to go on as sampson and grocery act i scene i
they shake hands
beyond the curtain the audience applauds the prologue as wabash comes through the curtain backstage
to wabash wonderful
w w w was it g g g good
the hemmings brothers enter the arena and the play begins
pov from the wings gregory on my word well not carry coals
no for then we should be colliers
will looks as if he would rather be dead
sam gosse approaches will nervously
nervously in a deep bass guttural hoarse voice master shakespeare absently luck be with you sam
as the awful truth gets through to him sam
in the same voice it is not my fault master shakespeare
i could do it yesterday
do me a speech do me a line
the effect is horrible parting is such sweet sorrow
henslowe has been overhearing
another little problem
what do we do now
the show must
you know go on
juliet does not come on for twenty pages
it will be all right
how will it
i dont know
its a mystery
and he makes his way towards the front of the house
a furious wessex is hurrying along the road to the theatre
viola and the nurse are arriving and looking for a seat in the gallery
burbage and his men are standing at the back behind the people seated in the gallery
the first scene of the play is continuing do you bite your thumb at us sir
i do bite my thumb sir
burbage finds henslowe plucking agitatedly at his sleeve
can we talk
they are standing behind the back row of the gallery seats
the spectator in front of them is the nurse
she turns round and shushes henslowe up
whispering to burbage we have no juliet
forgetting to whisper no juliet
turning no juliet
it will be all right madam
what happened to sam
who are you
their whispers are causing black looks and hushing noises from the neighbours
henslowe pulls viola from her seat luckily an aisle seat
do you know it
showing the manuscript every word
henslowe and burbage look at each other
cut to nurse where is my daughter
call her forth to me
now by my maidenhead at twelve year old i bade her come
sam who gathers himself to make his entrance quietly and horribly practising how now who calls
on stage god forbid
wheres this girl
the author and star will shakespeare has his back to the stage his hands over his ears
he is cowering in dread anticipation
as sam is about to enter henslowes hand yanks him by the collar and viola overtakes him and steps on stage
viola is not wearing the been hidden from us by her cloak
how now who calls
i am here what is your will
there is a collective gasp
nobody has ever seen a boy player like this
will takes his hands from his ears and turns round in amazement at the sound of violas voice
wessex has just arrived in the auditorium and jumps as if he has been shot
he seems about to intervene but looking around at the rapt faces he realises he cannot
henslowe and burbage look at each other
we will all be put in the clink
shrugs see you in jail
fennyman oblivious to the drama is practising his lines in a fever of nervousness
such mortal drugs i have but mantuas law is death to any he that utters them
an amazing performance that holds the audience spellbound
tybalt kills mercutio
to romeo i am hurt
the hurt cannot be much
ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man
a roll of thunder
over the heads of the audience far above the thatched roof of the theatre clouds are gathering in the sky
on stage mercutio is in romeos arms but the tone of the playing is unlike anything we have seen before without bombast intense and real
and the audience is quiet and attentive
why the devil came you between us
i was hurt under your arms
in the semirural view towards the city of london there can be discerned a gaggle of approaching men and three is something orderly about them
as they come closer we see that they are a company of pike men marching toward the theatre led by the master of the revels tilney
figures are running across the stage in the panic that follows tybalt death
romeo away be gone
the citizens are up and tybalt slain
stand not amazed
the prince will doom thee death if thou art taken
hence be gone away
i am fortunes fool
why dost thou stay
will has just killed tybalt
he is still breathless from fighting
he stands face to face with viola
i am fortunes fool
they stare at each other transfixed
you are married
she cannot answer
if you be married my gave is like to be my wedding bed
the implication of her silence fills the air
will does not move
we cannot tell whether this is the play or their life
the audience and the rest of the world might as well not exist
will turn from her and begins to descend from the balcony
art thou gone so
love lord ay husband friend i must hear from thee every day in the hour for in a minute there are many days
o by this count i shall be much in years ere i again behold my romeo
will as romeo seems unable to speak
then he says
all other sounds drain away and time seems to stop
o thinkst thou we shall ever meet again
methinks i see thee now thou art so low as one dead in the bottom of a tomb
either my eyesight fails or thou lookest pale
trust me love in my eyes so do you
dry sorrow drinks our blood
adieu now the friar is giving juliet his potion
no warmth no breath shall testify thou livest and in this borrowd likeness of shrunk death thou shall continue two and forty hours and then awake as from a pleasant
its fennymans moment
the apothecary and romeo
come hither man
i see that thou art poor
hold there is forty ducats
let me have a dram of poison such mortal drugs i have but mantuas law is death to any he that utters them
fennyman has cut in several lines early but his conviction is astonishing
my poverty but not my will consents
i pay thy poverty and not thy will
tilney on the march
his hand grips a copy of the curtain flyer
juliet lies dead
she lies on top of her tomb lying in stage her best dress her hair done her hands in prayer at her breast her eyes closed
romeo has found her like this
eyes look your last
arms take your last embrace
and lips oh you the doors of breath seal with a righteous kiss a dateless bargain to engrossing death
come bitter conduct come unsavory guide
thou desparate pilot now at once run on the dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark
as will embraces her violas eyes flicker open shielded by will from the audience and the lovers look at each other for a moment as will and viola rather than
as romeo and juliet
their eyes are wet with tears
burbage and rosaline are watching
kempe is watching
we see that in the audience are several of the whores we recognise from the brothel
they are weeping openly
will is raising the fatal drug in a last toast
heres to my love he drinks o true apothecary
fennyman moved but proud in the wings
whispers to himself i was good
i was great
thy drugs are quick
thus with a kiss i die
and he dies the nurse is weeping too
juliet wakes up with a start
where is my lord
i do remember well where i should be and there i am
where is my romeo
a cup closd in my true loves hand
poison i see hath been his timeless end
juliet takes romeos dagger
o happy dagger this is thy sheath
there rust and let me die
she stabs herself and dies
the inner curtain closes over the tomb
high angle on audience and stage
the prince played by wabash is having the last word
for never was a story of more woe than this of juliet and her romeo
there is complete silence
the actors are worried
but then the audience goes mad with applause
the inner curtain opens but will and viola are in a play of their own
embracing and kissing passionately making their own farewell
henslowe is too stunned and moved to react at first
then he looks at the audience and the penny drops
its a hit
the audience roars
will viola and the company come forward to meet the applause
tilney and his men burst in
tilney jumps up onto the stage where the admirals men are taking their bows
tilneys cops ring the stage facing inwards
shouts triumphantly i arrest you in the name of queen elizabeth
the audience goes quiet
burbage jumps out of the audience onto the stage
arrest who mr
the admirals men the chamberlains men and everyone of you neer do wells who stands in contempt of the authority invested in me by her majesty
you closed the rose i have not opened it
tilney is at a loss but only for a moment
he points a jaccuse finger at viola that woman is a woman
the entire audience and the actors recoil and gasp
the nurse crosses herself
you mean that goat
he points at viola brazening it out without much chance
ill see you all in the clink
in the same of her majesty queen elizabeth and an authoritative voice from the audience interrupts him
it is queen elizabeth herself descending now her hood and cloak thrown back
she is an awesome sight
a shaft of sunlight hits her
have a care with my name you will wear it out
there is a general parting of the waves soldiers and actors a general backing off and bowing as queen elizabeth takes the limelight
the queen of england does not attend exhibitions of public lewdness so something is out of joint
come here master kent
let me look at you
viola comes forward and is about to curtsey when she catches the queens eye an arresting eye which arrests the curtsey and turns it into a sweeping bow
yes the illusion is remarkable and your error mr
tilney easily forgiven but i know something of a woman in a mans profession yes by god i do know about that
that is enough from you maser kent
if only lord wessex were here
he is maam
the voice belongs to john webster
he points firmly at a figure in the audience wessex trying to look inconspicuous
weakly your majesty there was a wager i remember
as to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love
i think you lost it today
turning to webster you are an eager boy
did you like the play
i liked it when she stabbed herself your majesty
the queen fixes will with a beady eye
next time to you come to greenwich come as yourself and we will speak some more
will bows deeply
the queen turns to leave
the waves part for her
the queen is bowed out through the doors
a gaggle of the queens favoured courtiers wait by her carriage
wessex is hurrying down the exterior staircase as the queen emerges from the theatre
during the following a general egress from the auditorium is taking place including some of the actors crowding to see her off
wessex bows out of breath
why lord wessex
lost your wife so soon
indeed i am a bride short
how is this to end
viola has come out of the theatre amongst some of the other players
the queen catches her eye
as stories must when loves denied with tears and a journey
those whom god has joined in marriage not even i can put asunder
she turns to viola lord wessex as i foretold has lost his wife in the play house go make your farewell and send her out
its time to settle accounts
to wessex how much was the wager
the queen gives him a look pounds
give it to master kent
he will see it rightfully home
wessex gives his purse to viola
to viola and tell shakespeare something more cheerful next time for twelfth night
the queen proceeds towards her carriage
there is an enormous puddle between her and her carriage
the queen hesitates for a fraction and then marches through the puddle as cloaks descend upon it
too late too late
she splashes her way into her carriage which departs
heartbroken testing her name my lady wessex
viola nods heartbroken too
for a long moment they cannot say anything to each other
the she holds up wessexs purse
a hired player no longer
fifty pounds will for the poet of true love
i am done with theatre
the playhouse is for dreamers
look where the dream has brought us
it was we ourselves did that
and for my life to come i would not have it otherwise
i have hurt you and i am sorry for it
if my hurt is to be that you will write no more then i shall be the sorrier
will looks at her
the queen commands a comedy will for twelfth night
harshly a comedy
what will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom sick with love
an excellent beginning a beat let him be
and your heroine
bitterly sold in marriage and half way to america
adjusting at sea then a voyage to a new world
she lands upon a vast and empty shore
she is brought to the duke
despite himself orsino
good name but fearful of her virtue she comes to him dressed as a boy catching it and thus unable to declare her love pause
they look at each other
suddenly the conversation seems to be about them
but all ends well
how does it
i dont know
its a mystery will half smiles
then hes serious
they look deeply at each other
and rush into each others arm
you will never age for me nor fade nor die
nor you for me
good bye my love a thousand times good bye
write me well
she kisses him with finality
then turns and runs from him
will watches as she goes
a blank page
a hand is writing twelfth night
we see will sitting at his table
my story starts at sea
a perilous voyage to an unknown land
a shipwreck two figures plunge into the water the wild waters roar and heave
the brave vessel is dashed all to pieces and all the helpless souls within her drowned will at his table writing all save one
a lady viola in the water whose soul is greater than the ocean
and her spirit stronger than the seas embrace
not for her watery end but a new life beginning on a stranger shore viola is walking up a vast and empty beach
it will be a love story
for she will be my heroine for all time will looks up from the table
and her name will be
he looks down at the paper and writes viola then what country friends is this
dissolve slowly to viola walking away up the beach towards her brave new world
