the working draft by george a
romero we see the face of a young woman
she is asleep
it is very quiet at first as credits appear
the womans face begins to twitch as though she is having a bad dream
she moans slightly and her expression grows more desperate
a mix of subtle sounds begin to fade in
as they get louder we can discern what sounds like a busy office area
it is actually a frantic television studio with the hum of panic in a national emergency
the womans moans get louder and more desperate as the background sounds reach full volume and the credits stop
the woman sits up snapping awake
she lurches forwards into the arms of a strong young man
she is francine twenty three years old and very attractive although she is gritty with dirt
her hair is hanging dishevelled and sweaty
her jeans and blouse have been worn for several days
she is sitting on the floor where she has slept the last several hours covered by an old overcoat
tony you ok
fran stares at the young man
she is shaking
she doesnt speak
tony the shits really hitting the fan
the girl tries to clear her head as the young man moves on to where others sleep on the floor
he wakes them up one at a time
we begin to hear voices over the busy hum of the studio
they have an electronic tinniness as broadcast over a monitor
fran looks about
she is still shaken from her dream
we see the television studio
reporters buzz about madly
everybody looks dishevelled and exhausted
technicians man monitors and we see people on the little screens arguing emotionally
voice whats making it happen
what the hell voice yes but thats
voice thats a whole other study
voice but if we knew that we could
voice we dont know that
we dont know that
the room is pandemonium
people run in with wire copy others organise the stacks of bulletins as they arrive
others trip over cables and generally get in each others way
francine stares at the madness still trying to clear her head
mans voice im still dreaming
fran turns her head
another young man sits next to her on the floor
he is one of the ones tony awakened
fran no youre not
woman my turn with the coat
fran looks up
a young woman is offering her coffee in a paper cup
she is next in line for the overcoat and a few hours sleep
fran takes the coffee and struggles to her feet
woman the guys on the crew are getting crazy
fran staggers over to the control consoles
the technicians are at the end of their ropes
technicians all at once technicians we got a report that half those rescue fran focuses on the monitors
she is incredulous
stunned by the madness which surrounds her
she realises the hopelessness of the situation as she zeroes in on the televised conversation
we begin to listen over the din of the news room
tv man i dont believe that doctor and i dont tv man do you believe the dead are returning to tv man im not so
tv man do you believe the dead are returning to tv man im not so sure what to believe doctor
suddenly we cut into the studio and we see the argument as it is being shot
tv man cont tv man its fact
tv man its hard enough to believe without you tv man human dig
forget all human dignity
tv man youre not running a talk show here mr
tv man youre talking about abandoning every human a great cry of assent goes up from the studio floor
doctor foster is flustered and frustrated
the stage hands and cameramen are all screaming at him swearing and ridiculing
we notice police guards armed at the studio doors
they control the traffic in and out of the big room
back at the control panel
fran stares at the screens
confusion still reigns
man frannie get on the new list of rescue stations
fran pulls herself away from the monitors as the argument rages on screen
she fights through the heavy traffic and reaches charlie a harassed typist who holds the receiver of an emergency radio unit under his chin
charlie into receiver fran rescue stations
fran leafs through sheets of paper on charlies desk
he writes notes as he listens on the receiver and he speaks to the woman
charlie half those are inoperative any more
fran these are rescue stations
we cant send charlie into receiver charlie makes more notes and hands them to fran
still listening on the receiver he speaks to the woman again
charlie im doin what i can
these are definite fran snatches up the sheets and moves across the room
she stops at the consoles
fran im gonna knock off the old rescue stations
technician were sending people to places that have fran moves toward another control room
an armed officer stops her
a young man rushing through with copy intercedes
man hey shes alright
officer wheres your badge
fran reaches instinctively for the lapel of her blouse
her badge is missing
man shes alright
fran i had it
i was asleep over there
she makes a move toward the corner where she was asleep
man somebody stole it
theres a lot of em to officer the officer reluctantly steps aside
the young man and fan move down a crowded hall and into a small camera room
the foot traffic is solid
they talk as they walk
fran i dont believe it
man one of those little badges can open a lot fran its really going crazy
they reach a small camera installation
the camera is aimed at a machine which rolls out a list of rescue stations
the list is superimposed over the live broadcast as it goes out
cameraman you got new ones
fran i gotta type em up
kill the old ones
cameraman givens want em
fran kill em dick
tell givens to see me
the man clicks off his camera
fran moves toward the studio
on the monitors we see the rescue stations blink off over shots of the two men who still argue on the air
tv man well i dont believe in ghosts doctor
tv man these are not ghosts
nor are these humans
another outraged cry goes up from the stagehands and observers
doctor foster tries to out scream the cries
tv man you have not listened
you have not listened
fran moves into the large studio area where the broadcasters argue
the commotion is maddening
fran stares for a moment
tv man now distraught
almost pleading another outburst in the studio
tv man the situation must be controlled
before its fran moves through the crowded room of emotional people and finally reaches another emergency radio installation
skip and dusty are trying to listen to their receivers
they jot notes
fran operative rescue stations
dusty theyre droppin like flies
heres a few
fran yeah but not to the enemy
she gives the rest of her coffee to the two men
fran not much left but have a ball
the two men each slug eagerly from the paper cup
fran rushes off toward a large teleprompter typing machine
the broadcasters still argue emotionally
tv man people arent willing to accept your solutions tv man every dead body that is not exterminated handing the list of active rescue stations to the teleprompter typist fran
rushes back toward the control room
around the monitor consoles the commotion has been made even more frantic by an angered dan givens obviously one of the station managers
givens nobody has the authority to do that i want
givens spots fran as she moves into the room
givens garret who told you to kill the supers
i killed em
theyre out of date
givens i want those supers on the air all the time
fran are you willing to murder people by sending them givens without those rescue stations on screen every fran stares at the red faced man in disbelief
givens i want that list up on the screen every minute that fran is about to say something in anger but before she can one of the technicians having overheard
givens gets up from the control panel and starts to walk away
lucas what the hell are you doing
lucas anybody need a ride
two other men from various positions in the room snatch up personal effects and follow the technician toward the door
the door is guarded by a nervous officer
you stop them
stop those a frantic hubbub begins over the lack of console control
people rush in and out the floor directors voice can be heard over a talk back system
voices what the hells goin on in there
stop those men
the young officer faces the men as they reach his post
he takes a grip on his rifles opens the door and lets the group through
then he runs out himself deserting the losing cause
givens jumps toward the console
he frantically tries to work the complex dials and pots
givens get somebody in here that knows how to run fran moves slowly off toward the studio
in the big room the tension is thicker than ever
a few of the newsmen still earnestly try to perform their various functions but most of the crew are reduced to emotional polarisation over the broadcast which still rages
tv man they kill for one reason
fran stops to listen to the argument
she falls back into the shadows of the studio
people rush past her some leaving the studio in disgust
tv man if wed listened
if wed dealt with the foster wipes his sweat with a dirty hanker chief
he pulls his tie away from his tight collar and pops the shirt button open
he is desperate now shivering with anger and frustration
tv man there is a martial law state in effect in a murmur in the studio begins to build to an emotional crescendo
foster tries to talk over the noise
tv man citizens will be moved into central areas of technicians abandon their posts
a few others jump in to take their places but pandemonium reigns
a cameraman whips off his headset and breaks for the door
his camera spins on its liquid head and on the monitors we see a whirling blur as foster continues to speak
fran moves quickly for the spinning camera
she aims it back at the sweating foster and she stares through the viewfinder not believing what she is seeing
tv man the bodies of the dead will be delivered over suddenly a man darts out of the bustling crowd and comes up quickly behind fran
at nine oclock meet me on the roof
fran letting the camera slip slightly steve were getting out
in the chopper
another technician steps over to take the camera from fran
stephen talks more quietly in the other mans presence
steve nine p
weve got to
steve weve got to nothing fran
weve got to stephen is gone in a flash
fran nervously looks back at the cameraman
the argument still rages between foster and berman
the cameraman without taking his eye from the viewfinder speaks to francine quietly and slowly
cameraman go ahead
well be off the air by midnight it is dusk and the city of philadelphia is surprisingly quiet
we see several large buildings
they are part of a low income housing project and their lack of grace is evident
they stand like tombstones as the first stars appear in the navy blue sky
under cover of the growing darkness activities of the s
unit go unnoticed
grappling hooks grab against the lip around the roof and silent figures climb to the top of the building
men in armour vests clutching the latest in special weapons take position here and there about the development
other men strategically place their cars and trucks in the court below
on the roof at an entrance to one of the buildings fire stairs roger squats silently alongside three other team members
the men check their weapons
roger looks at his watch
the sweep hand reaches the
roger to himself lights
in an instant large searchlights bathe the side of the building
the troop commander shielded with other officers behind a large truck shouts through an electric bullhorn
youve been watching
you know we the electronically amplified voice echoes through the concrete caverns between the buildings of the project
there are only a few windows which glow with lights from inside
at the sound of the bullhorn the lights all blink out one at a time
commander not over the bullhorn sergeant looks like theyre gonna try to fight us
commander on the bullhorn again there is no sign of life in the building
the great concrete slab is silhouetted silently against the darkening sky
roger and his team mates crouch in readiness
the sound of the bullhorn rises to them easily and clearly
roger im givin you three minutes martinez
commander bullhorn roger there are no charges against you
commander there are no charges against you or any of your roger yet
commander three minutes martinez
roger and counting
he looks at his watch there is a long silence
roger come on martinez
one of the other s
team members is a big man with a rough and vicious looking face
he is wooley a hardened veteran and a red neck of the first order
wooley yeah come on martinez
show your greasy roger looks over at the big man
he is distressed at the pent up violence in wooley
wooley ill blow all their asses off
low life bastards
roger is greatly concerned
he looks at one of the other men a young smoothed faced rookie
the boy doesnt know now to react
he is obviously nervous
roger keep cool
just dont pop off in there when we the boy nods grateful for a more human contact
wooley how the hell come we stick these low lifes roger to the boy the boy nods in the affirmative
wooley lets get on with it
this is a waste of crash
without warning the metal door to the fire stair bursts open and several figures rush out of the darkness
shots are fired from hand guns
a bullet smashes through the skull of the young boy next to roger
he falls against roger with a pleading expression on his face
figures charge this way and that
the other s
men dodge and dive for cover
wooley opens fire with his automatic weapon
on the street the commander hearing the gunfire barks into the bullhorn commander move in
sergeant into walkie talkie on the roof roger struggles under the dead weight of the young man
he tries to free himself and his weapons
shots ring out
a handful of black and puerto rican youngsters charge about the rooftop
patrol appears from behind a large elevator housing
the young civilians retreat
several are mowed down
another bullet smashes against the dead s
just as roger frees himself a bullet catches him squarely in the chest but his armour takes the impact
he is thrown back off balance and he struggles to catch his wind as he scrambles over to recover his weapon which skitters away across the roof top
before he reaches the gun he is cut off by the looming figure of one of the black youths pistol in hand
the young man aims his hand gun but hesitates
a sudden barrage of bullets rips through the young black and he falls in a pool of blood
it was wooleys gun that killed him
wooley come on you dumb bastards
he fires again and again even though the skirmish is winding down
roger charges for his weapon snatches it up and runs for the cover of an incinerator housing
he startles a young civilian who was hiding there trying to load his gun
the boy makes a break
roger hold it
the boy freezes for a moment then thinking breaks into a run across the roof
roger hold it kid
dont run out there
the boy is mowed down in a crossfire
inside the building other s
teams along with units of the national guard are crashing through hallways and breaking into apartment units
people are herded into the halls where they are held at gun point
some men although armed surrender willingly
others retaliate against the invading force and little skirmishes develop on every floor of the complex structure
on the ground the commander barks into the bullhorn commander masks
sergeant into walkie talkie tear gas canisters crash through windows and the halls are filled with clouds of gas
civilians trying to escape are choked as they attempt to shoot their way out
the teams on the roof charge down the fire stairs into the building
roger and wooley and the men in their unit snap on their bizarre looking gas masks
the troopers break into an apartment on the floor
an old couple kneels in prayer at a small alter while their children and their childrens children huddle in a corner
the young husband surrenders his gun to a trooper and roger watches as the group is led into the hallway
suddenly a young black man charges out of one of the apartments
a woman appears at the door screaming for him to stop
he breaks through a cloud of gas and wooley fires his automatic
the black man crashes to the floor
wooley is crazed
he kicks in the door of another apartment and fires randomly into the room
the flurry of action causes panic among the civilians in the hall
the younger ones try to escape while the older people kneel or fall against the walls praying
shouting wooley kicks in the door of another apartment
roger charges at him and grabs him around the shoulders
the big man resists
his gun fires and bullets fly wildly
he struggles against roger but roger manages to hold on
roger gimme a hand
trooper steps up out of the cloud of gas
he is very tall and he looks mysterious in the fog as he speaks in a deep voice
trooper step away from him
roger gimme a hand
wooley throws his body around and slams roger against the wall but roger grabs him again just as the crazed man is levelling off his gun at the open apartment
trooper step away from him
just then wooley wrenches free and pushes roger across the hallway
the trooper carefully aims his weapon and fires one shot through wooleys head
the big man falls back violently
the mysterious trooper turns and hurries away down the hall
officers face him threateningly
he stares at them through his mask
they let him pass
he disappears through the smoke as other officers begin to restore order among the civilians
women scream and cry over their dead loved ones
roger is helped to his feet by another officer
rogers eyes are wide and staring through the insect like lenses of his mask
they are locked on the sight he sees through the door of the apartment which wooley kicked open
the other trooper looks and his eyes widen as well
in the apartment lying in a pool of blood are the partial remains of what was a human body
it has been ripped to shreds
roger staggers against the door frame
the other trooper moves inside
another corpse also mutilated one leg missing one arm badly mangled
it is trying to move
to reach the troopers
a sudden loud scream
roger startles and spins around
a woman in the hall has seen the grisly sight and she runs screaming down the corridor
more confusion as civilians push through the troopers who try to hold them back
the trooper in the apartment is revulsed
a third officer enters the apartment
he speaks to the trooper which is closest to the writhing corpse on the floor
trooper shoot it
shoot it through the head
the young officer is too dumb struck to respond so the third officer pulls out his pistol
then suddenly from out of the shadows a spectre like figure lunges at the third officer flailing and biting at his arms
it is a wild haired woman
there are several bleeding wounds over her body
she is one of the walking dead
the trooper struggles to free himself and roger darts into the room
although the zombie is weak she manages to hold on to the trooper
another creature suddenly appears in the bedroom doorway
a male it staggers out into the room
the young trooper struggles with his holster trying to free his hand gun
suddenly he feels something on his leg
the dismembered corpse is clutching his ankle pulling itself closer its mouth open
the boy tries to pull away but falls onto the floor crashing over a table and lamp
he tries to crawl away but the frail corpse keeps its hold and drags along behind the young trooper who still cannot free his pistol
roger and the third officer fling all their weight against the woman zombie
she flies against a wall but bounces back immediately and attacks again
the third troopers rifle fires
a slug tears through the womans chest but it doesnt stop her onslaught
another shot rips through her neck
still she comes
the boy on the floor manages to level off his pistol
he fires at the ghoulish head which draws closer to his leg
the things skull blows open and its grasp relaxes
the boy is shaking violently
his arm and gun stay in the air still poised
he fires again
in the hall the male zombie appears and the crowd panics
the troopers try to keep things calm
the woman pushes through the crowd
the zombies advances
before the trooper can stop her the woman throws her arms around the creature
his gun is levelled off but he cant get a shot the zombie clutches at the woman
it bites at her neck
she screams with terror
she tries to pull away but the creature holds her
it bites again
a trooper comes up from behind and tries to wrestle the creature away
another trooper grabs the woman and tries to free her
she is screaming insanely
the zombie pulls another piece of flesh off her arm
in the apartment the female zombie lunges at the third trooper and the two tumble to the floor
roger wrestles her free and with all his might throws her against the wall
she advances again
roger raises his gun she is just about to reach him
the bullet drops her
in the hall a trooper brings his gun butt slamming against the male ghouls head
the creature loses his grip on the screaming woman
the trooper who is holding her pulls her free across the floor
the bullet tears through the zombies shoulder
through his neck
through the skull
there is finally a calm
a few of the citizens murmur prayers
troopers and befuddled old people seem to drift through the clouds of gas in a totally dazed state
roger and the third trooper from the apartment drift to the hallway
the third trooper moves into the crowd but roger stands against the open door jamb for a moment
a sudden loud gunshot makes roger duck and spin around
he looks into the apartment
the young trooper has shot himself through the head
in the dark firestair it is very quiet
roger bursts through a metal door from one of the halls and falls against the stair railing
he is retching
he breathes heavily to contain himself
he removes his mask and coughs slightly from the gas mist which still clings in the air
voice youre not alone brother
roger tightens grabbing for his gun
the voice is present very nearby
roger looks up
sitting on the stairs above is the trooper who shot wooley
his rifle is aimed at roger
voice you was in wooleys unit
roger i didnt see nothin
roger slings his rifle so the trooper relaxes and lowers his gun
he removes his gas mask
he is black
roger you runnin
the black man shrugs
he hasnt decided
roger i dont just mean cause of wooley
roger theres a lot of people runnin
roger stares up at the grim faced black
roger i could run right tonight
the black man just stares levelly into rogers eyes
roger friend of mine got a helicopter
he does the black man smiles
roger you think its right to run
the black man shrugs again then he stands and walks down the stairs
he turns past roger on the landing and continues down into the lingering gas mist
a few landings down
the two troopers freeze
the stairwell is dark
the noise grows louder
the troopers ready their weapons
the sounds are little scraping thumps like the weary foot falls of someone
trying to negotiate the stairs
there is the low wheezing sound of laboured breath
the men stare at the landing below
the black man steps forward slightly trying not to make a sound
suddenly a figure pops out of the darkness
it falls against the wall below
both troopers raise their guns
the figure pulls away from the wall
in the mist its shape is ghostly
is sees the troopers
the voice weakens into a low wheezing cough
the figure slumps and sits on the steps clinging to the railing
it is an old priest obviously from a local puerto rican parish
roger stoops next to the old man who is struggling to keep his breath
he is weary
he seems to be near death
he clutches at his chest
roger tries to support him
roger lets get him to the medics
let roger theyre takin everyone down
they probably priest my sister
she is dead
they tell me
roger and the black trooper shoot glances at one another
priest just let me pass
martinez is dead
the priest goes into a coughing fit
the troopers look on
roger wants to help in some way
priest many have died on these streets in the last the troopers are shocked
the priest struggles to his feet
priest i have given them the last rites
the old man starts up the stairs
roger moves to help him but the big black man stops him
the priest weaves up through the gas mist coughing
priest you are stronger than us
but soon i the old mans voice trails off up the stairwell as he disappears in the cloud
priest when the dead walk senores
we must in the basement of the large building s
troopers pry at the boards which are nailed over the entrance to the storage area
the rest of the riot troops stand at the ready weapons raised
high powered rifles
the nails creak loudly as they are pulled free
the men are silent not knowing what to expect
there are three boards left
with a great tearing sound the door flies open before the men remove the last boards
the boards fly and the door almost rips off its hinges
like flood waters a small army of zombies pushes into the hall
they are wide eyed and terrifying
in life they were mostly blacks and puerto ricans from the neighbouring buildings
they are all ages from the very old to the very young
the riot troops are stunned
they cannot react quickly enough and the squeeze is so tight in the little hall that it is impossible to shoot accurately or without the bullets injuring other troopers
the men fight back wrestling and trying to back away
in the front line zombies bite at the flesh of the humans
teeth tear into arms and hands
some men are trampled in the crush
commander back off
the rear lines retreat into the wider vestibule and as the mass of struggling bodies spreads out shots begin to fire
some troopers at close quarters are able to fire off accurate rounds with their hand guns
others fall and are lunged at by clutching ghouls
roger and the black trooper are in the middle of the battle
they fight off several of the creatures
the battle spreads into little skirmishes through the dark hallways
the highly organised troopers are scattered and confused by the mindless onslaught
as the main action moves away from the entrance to the storage area several troopers move into the room
the walls are dank and grey
there is a dripping sound
all around lie remnants of human civilisation
baby buggies and bicycles chained to pipes which ring the area
large trunks and cartons of every size and shape old beds and other furniture
and here and there throughout the large area lie the remains of corpses
they have been eaten away
most of them are still moving their heads uninjured
two of the troopers retreat revulsed
the sound of the gunfire and screaming can be heard from the hall
the big black man walks calmly into the room
roger watches him
he walks up to the writhing creatures one at a time and fires carefully aimed shots into their heads with his hand gun
tears roll down his cheeks
some of the creatures are without arms and legs
some have been eaten away about the neck and shoulder
they moan with a gurgling gutteral sound as they try to move
a young black zombie pulling itself along the floor with one arm draws close to the black trooper
the big man aims his pistol
he quickly and efficiently reaches for more ammunition and begins to reload
the zombie pulls closer its mouth wide
roger steps up behind the other trooper and fires into the creatures head with his automatic rifle
the black man brushes tears from his eyes and continues to load the pistol
roger disposes of several other creatures
he comes to a place where several are piled together
some lie still others writhe about
two on the heap although they cannot move about are eating at parts of other bodies
roger shoots them
they never look up
they dont seem to notice him at all
a loud creaking sound breaks the mood suddenly
roger looks up
in the ceiling a double set of loading doors has been opened
several other troopers look down into the storage area
trooper jesus christ
he shines a light beam down towards roger
trooper you ok down there
trooper this must be where they dumped em in
roger looks down at the pile of corpses beneath the opening
trooper you need more men
roger shakes his head no
trooper jesus christ
the trooper leaves the opening
he is replaced by two others who just stare down into the storage room through the weird round lenses of their masks
the distant sounds of the battle in the hall flare up again
the big black man snaps his loaded clip into his pistol and takes a few steps forwards
he sees a corpse wrapped in a bed sheet and tied securely with clothes line
it looks like a mummy
it is writhing trying to free itself
he shoots it through the head
nearby a small corpse that of a very young child is also writhing but the end of the shroud where the childs feet should be has been torn open and
a stump kicks around the blood where a foot has been eaten off
the black man fires into the things head
black just the fresh corpses
before they revive
roger why did these people keep them here
why black cause they still believe theres the big man fires into the head of another squirming zombie
in the halls of the building troopers fall and are pounced on by ghouls
other troopers fire their automatics through the heads of attacking zombies
the riot troops try to stay organised but the onslaught is so mindless and random that it is turning into a riot
a the buildings of philadelphia loom in the moonlight
what few lights remain lit reflect in the waters of the delaware
b it is quiet except for the slight sounds of lapping water and an occasional wooden creak as the floating docks strain against one another
there are a few big police launches still docked in the marina
they bob about silently
the chain which normally restricted the area is broken and dangling
the sign which reads city of philadelphia police no admittance clangs against the broken chain in the wind
halfway down the long dock is a little guard house
inside sitting at a radio transmitter is the corpse of a uniformed guard
nearby is a separate floating dock on which is painted a large square pattern
it is a landing bay for police helicopters
alongside afloat separately but securely chained fast is a small fuel barge with pumps and hoses for refueling the chopper and launches
the other bodies lie bleeding on the bobbing docks another officer and a civilian
a bell buoy rings in the distance and we begin to hear the sound of an approaching helicopter
the blades of the j
traffic copter whine as they gear down for a landing
the whirlybird settles like a hummingbird on the gently bobbing heliport
with the blades still spinning loudly stephen hops out of the cockpit
steve come on
i need you
francine unbuckles her safety belt and jumps out of her side of the machine
steve runs ducking under the blades around to the womans side of the cockpit grabs her hand and they make for the fuel pumps
steve i dont see roger
well give him ten minutes
fran oh my god
the woman freezes in mid stride and her action brings stephens eyes around to see what she is staring at
the two bodies which lie near the fuel pumps
steve you havent been out in it at all
he pulls her quickly along
they have to actually step over the civilian corpse
fran freezes again
she cant bring herself to walk over the body
steve lets go of her hand and checking the tank gauge he pulls the hose with him as he moves quickly back to fran
the long hose is heavy and it bobbles the civilian corpse almost rolling it over
the back of the bodies head has been blown out by the exit wound of a powerful bullet
blood still runs
the wound is fresh
steve does not see this as he tugs the hose over the corpse and moves to the helicopter with fran following
at the side of the machine the blades still spinning overhead steve jams the hose nozzle into the fuel tank receptacle
he pulls one of frans hands into the nozzle mechanism
steve just like this
like a car
fran responds getting the feel of the nozzle trigger
steve thats it
just hold her there til she the woman takes over and stephen trots away toward the guard shed
the propeller blades still spin
they make an eerie whispering sound as they pass over frans head
she can hear the lapping water now and the creaking moans of the shifting docks
she looks this way and that fear in her eyes
at the guard house stephen rushes in to find the dead radio operator
a signal is coming over the receiver in morse code
the corpse is slumped over the desk and it is covering the send key
a small entry wound is barely visible in the back of the dead mans head
as stephen pulls the body up to an erect posture in its chair he sees that the exit of the bullet all but obliterated the corpses face
again the wound is still running and bits of flesh and blood are splattered about the desk and the radio unit
stephen clicks on the send switch and he quickly begins to send a message in morse back on the fuel dock the long hose brushes over the civilian corpse
a shadow moves nearby making is aware of a presence other than frans
the woman switches hands on the pump nozzle
the blades still whoosh overhead
then she hears the sound of another engine
she looks towards the mainland
the headlights of an approaching vehicle can be seen
at the guard house stephen hearing the approaching engine steps into the doorway and looks up the dock
he calls to fran
steve i hope its roger
fran what are you doing
steve ill be right there
he ducks back into the shed
he snatches up a first aid kit and throws it into a khaki knapsack
he rummages in the darkness
he finds a toolbox
as he stands up he backs into a tall figure which stands in the shadows
feeling something sharp and hard against his back
steve recoils and spins to face the figure
it is a uniformed officer
his rifle is levelled off at steves chest
from out of the shadows a second policeman appears with a hand gun cocked and aimed
frans eyes strain to discern the approaching vehicle but suddenly she catches a movement in the corner of her vision
through the open sides of the helicopter bubble she notices a police van
it has been there all along its doors flung wide open as though abandoned hurriedly
now one of the rear doors move
a figure appears carrying a large packing carton
the figure is uniformed with two rifles strapped to its back
it rushes toward the launch docks
voice just stay cool
fran already startled by the running figure is now doubly shocked by the calm voice behind her
she spins and the fuel nozzle clatters out of its receptacle to the wooden dock boards
she is facing another policeman to aims a rifle directly at her head
officer if you die
itll be your own fault
the officer who is running with the carton shouts toward the guard house
officer come on skipper
they got friends comin
in the guard house steve is held at bay by one of the officers while the other uniformed man moves to the door to check the progress of the approaching
officer who are you
steve were with j
officer at the door referring to the arrival time of the vehicle officer the skipper pushes steve with his gun barrel
steve spins out through the open doorway
he looks up the dock and sees the vehicle which is just turning onto the pier which is almost a mile long
officer has moved around fran and he reaches into the helicopter bubble pulling out steves rifle
steve now wait a minute
were just here to refuel
officer looking at the insignia on the helicopter steve trying to capitalise on his minor celebrity power officer no shit
officer shouting from the helicopter steve freezes again sensing that these are not law enforcers
the man who was carrying the carton is now rushing back up the dock having deposited his load in one of the motor launches
officer cant all fit
officer directly to stephen officer hey man i aint goin nowhere in nothin i officer has returned to the van and is carrying out another carton rushing back to the
officer thats true
somethin happens to him and officer get a lot further in this bird
suddenly above the two white headlights of the approaching vehicle we see a third light in red
it is the spinning bubble gum machine of a squad car
it is heralded by one blast of the cars siren
officer hey thats a black and white
officer still holds his rifle aimed at fran
officer they seen us
officer its alright
officer dumps his carton at the edge of the dock and pulls one rifle from his back
officer bull shit
lets get to the boat
officer stares hard at stephen
then at the squad car
then back at the nervous young pilot
officer youre runnin aint you fly boy
steve does not respond
he is terrified not knowing what answer to be the safest
officer you and your friends is runnin off in the the man starts to grin with knowing
he suddenly feels in more control
officer sit tight boys
theyre runin too
it seems to take forever for the police car to pull down the dock
stephen takes a few steps forward squinting to see but he is threatened by the policemans gun barrels
the car screeches to a stop and two armed s
troopers immediately pop out of the front seat on either side
they are roger and the black trooper
roger whats the problem officer
officer caught your friends here stealin company roger what do you mean friends
roger is trying to play dumb assuming that the other policemen are on official business
steve they know rog
officer itd be crazy to start shootin at one roger sure would
officer alright lets load up
he slings his rifle and tosses the other gun back to fran
she bobbles it and it falls skittering across the dock
officer you better learn how to use that thing woman
the policemen start to unload crates and cartons from their van
the big black trooper pulls a few supplies from out of the squad car and carries them toward the helicopter
fran trots over toward stephen
he is just coming back out of the guardhouse where he picked up the toolbox and the knapsack full of supplies
the woman falls into his arms
roger trots up
roger you ok
stephen nods referring to the big black roger his names peter
the three are already moving toward the helicopter
roger lets hustle
peter has stowed the supplies in the rear of the cockpit and he has noticed the fuel hose lying on the dock
he tries the nozzle in the receptacle on the chopper and holds it in until the tank fills
the other policemen are still moving cartons of supplies from their van down the dock
roger to the other policemen they reach the cockpit
fran climbs in and crouches on the floor in the rear of the bubble
fran you sure thisll carry us all
steve little harder on the fuel but well be ok
as peter climbs aboard one of the other policemen carrying a final carton speaks to roger
you got any cigarettes
roger looks at the others one at a time
fran shakes her head no
he trots around to the passenger seat steve where ya headed
officer down river
got an idea maybe we can make it to steve what islands
he starts the engine officer any islands
what about you
where you headed
steve straight up
the policeman rushes off with his two cohorts
as they untie one of the launches from the dock the j
helicopter whines loudly
then it lifts off the dock with a smooth motion
the police launch starts without a problem and it pulls out onto the dark river
the lights on the helicopter blink as the metal bird swoops low over the philadelphia skyline
we see an empty city
betsy ross house which flies the original american flag
the oldest american heritages stand coldly in the night
the whirring engine fades overhead
in the cockpit fran lights a cigarette
so does roger
no one comments but peter smiles slightly
the big black looks down at the city
peter any of you leavin people behind
fran an ex husband
roger an ex wife
steve you peter
peter still looking down the whirlybird cuts through the dark night sky
it flies over open country now moving west
some time has passed
roger is asleep in the passenger seat
twisted in the cramped rear of the cockpit fran and peter sit very close to each other
peter still stares off into the night
fran real brothers
peter looks at her
he has a strong face
fran real brothers or
fran how many real ones
peter ones in jail
the others a pro ball player
fran doesnt quite know how to respond
peter nodding at steve
the engine roars too loudly for the pilot to hear the conversation fran is taken off guard
she smiles slightly
fran most of the time yeah
peter just like to know who everyone is
light downs on the horizon
the little helicopter chugs through the shades of blue
now fran is asleep and roger still snores
peter stares at the back of the pilots head
steve nods slightly then shakes himself
soon he nods again
peter kicks him in the shoulder
steve looks back surprised that the big man is awake
peter just stares at him
steve rubs his face violently with his free hand
he pulls at his lower eyelids
steve any more water
peter reaches into the supplies and produces a plastic container with water
steve slugs some of it and pours a little onto his face
then he passes it back to peter who also drinks
suddenly fran stiffens and wakes up with a start
peter looks over at her with a gentle expression
she takes a moment to orient herself
peter to stephen steve i know exactly where we are
steve passed it about an hour ago
roger finally wakes up from the loud talking
steve were pretty low on fuel
im just waitin in the morning light several fires can be seen on the ground where buildings are burning
the chopper flies over a national guard convoy as it chugs up a winding country road
here and there on the ground human activity can be seen
search and destroy units made up of police guardsmen and civilian volunteers move across the country side
occasionally a zombie is seen staggering through the trees or over a field
gunfire cuts the creature down
steve were still pretty close to johnstown
were a little country airfield lies quiet in the morning sun
there is no sign of life
a few private planes dot the area but the tower is empty
chopper buzzes very low just outside the tower windows
as the whirlybird slowly sets down near the fuel pumps its blades create a wind blast which raises great clouds of dust from the dry earth
sheets of old newspaper and other light debris are sent flying through the air in all directions
one piece of torn newsprint blows flat against a window in one of the little sheds
it sticks against the glass for a moment as though glued there then it flutters to the ground
as the paper clears the glass we see the face of a badly scarred zombie peering out through the window
as the group scrambles out of the helicopter stephen immediately checks the fuel pumps
steve shit man damn near empty
roger lotta private planes in farm country like this
steve to where
where the hell can they go
peter where we goin
by now steve has drained the dregs from the first pump into the choppers tank and moved to the second pump
it spurts with more force
steve theres a good bit left in this pump
he stretches the hose toward the chopper but it doesnt quite reach
i gotta get it closer
steve jumps back into the cockpit and the machine lifts off the ground
fran is watching the action walking slowly backwards to a small rickety hangar area
she turns and looks down to the private hangars
most of them are open wide the planes they housed long gone
one or two of the old wooden double doors are still closed and locked with chains and padlocks
the wind from the chopper blades blows her hair and sends more debris flying
peter kicks open the door to the chart house
the room is dusty and dilapidated
a few small chairs surround an old wooden table
several half finished cups of coffee sit on top of wrinkled flight charts leaving brown rings on the paper
flies buzz loudly
an old window shade clicks against its window from the gusting of the wind and it makes peter flinch
he readies his weapon
when he sees the shade he steps over to it easily pulls it and lets it roll up on itself
it makes a loud flapping noise
outside the chopper sets down
roger is ready with the hose nozzle
ducking under the blades he inserts the device into the tank receptacle even before stephen has idled the engine
stephen hops out of the cockpit and shouts over the engine noise
steve im gonna see whats left in the hangars
he trots off after fran
in the chart house peter idly drops a coin into an old coffee machine at one end of the room
the machine clicks loudly and spits out a cup
to peters surprise the cup starts to fill with hot brown liquid
while he waits
peter notices a series of notes taped to the machine and the surrounding walls
they are all written hurriedly in various hands and with all sorts of inks and colours
there are dozens of such messages
peter takes the full coffee cup from the machine
as he sips it his eyes fall on a closet door just across the room
it is moving slightly
it is locked but it bangs against the lock
more regularly than if caused by the wind drafts
peter steps closer
now the door bangs violently with a loud crash but it holds
peter sets his coffee on the chart table and takes his rifle in both hands
again the door bangs hard and a skeleton key is knocked out of the keyhole
it falls to the floor with a metallic clang and peter notices a caked blood stain where blood recently ran out of the closet under the door and onto the
another bang and a gurgling moan
one of the living dead is trying to break out of the closet
peter raises his rifle and aims it at the door about head high
the rifle roars in the little room and a splintery hole appears in the old wooden door
outside fran and stephen snap to attention at the sound of the rifle
fran stands at the entrance to one of the little wooden hangars
stephen is checking out the cockpit of an old cessna inside
immediately stephen runs out and grabs frans hand
as they turn the corner to run up the grade to the helicopter they are confronted with two zombies staggering slowly towards them through the dust cloud from the chopper
they have no weapons with them
under the whirling chopper blades roger continues to fill the fuel tank
in the roar of the engine he cannot hear anything else
a third zombie lumbers toward the helicopter
rogers back is to the creature and he is unaware of the impending danger
inside the chart house
peter stares at the closet door
it is still for a moment
then another moan and the door bangs again
peter fires two shots lower right and lower left of the first forming a triangle
the two creatures advance slowly on fran and steve
steve just run
fran is petrified
she turns and looks behind them
they are boxed in by the hangars
steve run right past em
right around em
the zombies draw closer
steve run frannie
goddammit im right behind you
fran charges up the little grade
she runs to the right of the creatures and they move in her direction arms outstretched
as she draws near to the dead things she hesitates again in fright
the creatures claw at the air
the one in front is within a few feet of the woman
steve run frannie
fran stares into the dead staring eyes of the lead zombie
she is almost hypnotised
at the last instant she runs and just gets past the creatures
a little up the grade she turns and looks back stopping again
one zombie turns slowly and starts up the grade after fran
the other continues to advance on stephen
stephen ducks back into the open hangar
it is very dark but for thin beams of sunlight which cut through between the wooden boards of the structure
stephen roots around among the greasy tools which clutter the area
he finds an enormous sledge hammer
he runs out of the shed
he dodges around the lead zombie who staggers on with inertia
steve sees that fran is still facing the second creature
the man takes a firm grip on the giant hammer as he charges up the grade toward the zombies back
as he reaches the creature he brings the twenty pound steel head of the sledge slamming against the ghouls skull with all his might
the creature staggers on for a few more steps its head a bloody pulp then it falls to its knees and finally flops face down in the dust
without breaking stride stephen grabs frans hand and the two run toward the helicopter
the other zombie at the hangar has turned around and is walking up the grade
roger is pumping the last drops out of the fuel hose when he sees the frightened couple making for the chopper
as steve charges up the grade he sees the zombie approaching roger from behind
steve shouts and roger spins around
the stumbling creature is very close
it raises its arms and its hands clutch at the air
roger lets the fuel nozzle drop to the ground
he is trapped at the side of the machine
he doesnt have his rifle
he fumbles with the snap on his hand gun holster
suddenly the blank face of the zombie turns red as the top of its head seems to disintegrate into a bloody pulp
the creature has walked into the spinning chopper blade
its body staggers forward another step or two then the thing collapses in a heap
stephen and fran have reached the chopper
steve lets go of the womans hand and he drops his bloody sledge to the ground
he lunges into the cockpit and snatches up his rifle ducking in the propeller draft
the zombie which is stumbling up the grade from the hangars almost loses its footing but it regains its balance and advances steadily toward the helicopter
the shot misses clean
he fires again
the bullet grazes the creatures face
it staggers from the impact but does not fall
roger moves quickly for his high powered weapon
steve fires two more rounds
another miss and another graze this time on the arm
he is about to shoot once more when roger stops him stepping up alongside
roger calmly aims and fires one shot cleanly through the creatures brain
the zombie falls and papers blow over its body
in the chart house
peter fires several more shots into the closet door
bullet holes appear just where the creatures head should be
there seems to be no way that the volley could have missed
silence for a moment
peter still holds his gun high
then with a great crash the closet door flies open into the room
two small children burst out
one has no left arm the other has been bleeding from a great wound in his side
they are dead
they move directly toward peter
their heads are at least a foot shorter than the bullet holes in the closet door
peter stares down at the creatures revulsed
he is so startled that he cannot react quickly enough and they are on him
the moment he feels their clammy grasp he regains his survival instincts
he cannot effectively aim his rifle
he kicks and thrashes around
one creature flies against a wall
the other is about to bite the mans arm
the big black grabs the small zombie and flings it physically back
the other creature pounces on his back
he throws it over his shoulders and it crashes against its brother
now peter raises his gun
as the children try to scramble to their feet the man fires several shots in rapid succession
first one creature falls then the other
peter continues to fire his eyes wide with desperation and disgust
finally his weapon clicks
it is out of ammunition
peter breathes heavily
he stares at the small corpses
instinctively he begins loading his weapon without even looking at the action as he backs wearily out toward the door of the chart house
behind him in the brightly sunlit doorway we see the zombie who first appeared at the window
the creature staggers forward
peter turns and startles
he reaches for more shells and backs away a few steps as he tries to load the bullets into his gun
the creature reaches out and takes another step into the room
peter stares into the creatures eyes
then suddenly out in the sunlight a few hundred feet behind the zombie stephen appears with his rifle
peter sees the man over the creatures shoulder
steve raises his gun and aims at the zombie but the barrel seems to be on a straight line with peter
peter ducks quickly
steves gun fires
the bullet misses the creature cleanly and crashes into the room
it ricochets off the coffee machine
another shot crashes through the glass in the front room
peter crouches still stuffing shells into his weapon
a third of stephens bullets tears through the zombies shoulder but the creature still stands
it turns toward peter slowly
peter crawls under the table as another shot splatters into the coffee cups
once again roger steps up beside stephen
he fires one carefully aimed shot looking through his telescopic range finder
just as peter finishes loading his weapon the zombie crashes into the room falling over the table and onto the floor
fran is still kneeling in the dust trying to keep herself from vomiting
stephen rushes to her side
roger keeping his rifle poised shouts toward the chart house
the big black man appears in the doorway snapping the safety on his rifle
frans retching causes her to choke and cough
steve tries to comfort her not knowing what to say and shaking himself
peter advances with long strides
stephen looks up when the black man is a dozen steps away
immediately he sees the anger in peters eyes
the big trooper then raises his rifle and aims it a stephen
steve tries to stand but trips and falls on his back in the dust
in an instant peter is looming over him with the barrel of his rifle aimed at point blank range for the shivering mans forehead
fran screams through her choking
what are you doing
peter speaks calmly to stephen in low tones
peter you never aim a gun at anyone mister
stephen looks up at the tall man shivering
then peter lowers his weapon and extends his hand helping stephen up onto his feet
roger clears the fuel hose from around the runners of the chopper
peter climbs into the cockpit and sits in the rear without saying another word
roger helps fran climb aboard
steve wanders around the front of the cockpit bubble and climbs into the pilots seat
roger climbs in behind fran as she squeezes into the uncomfortable space beside peter
the big black offers the woman a sip of water which she accepts
then she lets her head flop wearily against the rear bulkhead
steve is urgently surveying his flight charts shuffling the papers and trying to seem very busy after the embarrassment of the incident
steve we gotta find fuel
maybe closer to pittsburgh
roger no weve gotta stay out of the big cities
peter we might not get out of any place alive
roger were gettin outa here fine
peter yeah well it wasnt those things that stephen turns around and is about to say something angrily
roger stops him by speaking urgently
roger we gotta stay in the sticks
theres bound to steve reluctantly going back to his charts roger probly still manned
we dont need those steve theyre just out after scavengers
peter oh you got the papers for this limousine
steve angrily peter right
and were out here doin traffic reports
there is a long silence
the engine drones but the helicopter still sits on the ground
the men look at each other
peter takes a long slug of water
fran jesus christ
we dont even know where were we see a wide shot of the little airfield
chopper sits on the ground for a moment its props spinning
the with a surge of power it lifts off and flies away
the dry earth swirls up into clouds and blows more bits of paper over the wide eyed corpses which lie in the morning sunlight
we see the facade of an enormous structure
it is a huge suburban shopping mall
the outer walls are all concrete and their clean lines stretch upward for more than two storeys
the building looks like a giant domino lying flat on the ground
there are only four entrances and the shops which are housed within have no windows opening onto the surrounding lot
in the immense area around the building lanes and stalls are painted for automobile parking
what few cars now dot the area are parked randomly some with their doors open wide
we hear the sound of the helicopter engine fading in then we see the little machine as it approaches and eases down onto the roof of the building
in the parking lot walking among the abandoned vehicles we see several of the living dead
they look almost like normal shoppers at the mall for morning chores but their lumbering walk is unmistakably stiff
at one of the mall entrances we see a revolving door flanked by several regularly hinged doors all made of glass and surrounded by large windows
a few of the zombies manage to negotiate the hinged doors and enter the building
others bounce off windows and claw the transparent glass in confusion
one creature walks around in the revolving door endlessly
there are a good many of the creatures but they are spread out and far between
they move with no seeming purpose
we do not yet see the mall interior
the zombies pay no attention to the sound of the chopper engine stopping overhead
on the roof even as the blades of the helicopter still spin the humans are out and moving to the edge of the building
they look down at the creatures which dot the parking lot
fran oh my god
stephen no chance
forget it lets get outta here
roger wait a minute wait a minute
they cant get up here
steve yeah and we cant go down there
roger lets check it out
roger trots away
peter has moved directly to an area where a giant grid of transparent plexiglas bubbles face down into the building
he stares through one of them and can see into the mall below
roger trots up and peers through another of the bubbles
peter most of the gates are down
i dont think they can get into the stores
the vantage point only reveals a small aspect of the interior a square plaza with a garden beneath the sunroof of transparent bubbles
the space is open all the way down to the garden which is two storeys below
around the garden on the bottom floor can be seen the entrances to several shops
all but one have heavy metal cage gates down and locked into position
one or two zombies are seen wandering about
they cannot enter the stores except for the one which is un gated
halfway up the walls can be seen a balcony railing which rings the entire plaza it is a second storey of shops
the same cage gates seal off the visible store entrances but none of the dead creatures are evident on the balcony
fran and stephen come trotting up to the bubbles
roger i havent seen any of them up on the second peter the big department stores usually use both roger if we can get in up top
peter is looking across the rest of the expansive rooftop
he takes off toward a series of other housings which jut up out of the otherwise flat surface
fran still staring down through a bubble steve also looking down below the zombies which are in sight wander aimlessly over the plaza
some try the gates but cannot budge them
one wanders out of the single open shop it is a female
the shop is an appliance store
as the creature leaves she drags a toaster idly behind her pulling it by its power cable
it scrapes on the floor loudly
we see an installation of large reflectors mounted in an intricate metal skeleton which stretches across a large area of the roof surface
behind the structures can be seen a large power generator
peter solar screens
roger cant be enough to power this place
peter emergency system maybe
roger its pretty lit up in there
peter guess the powers not off in this area
roger hey look at this
roger is peering down through a wire hatched skylight
there are several laid out over this particular area of the roof
he moves to another while peter looks down into the first
fran and stephen jog up
roger these dont go down into the mall
fran and stephen peer down into the darkness
peter pulls a flashlight from his utility belt
he has stayed in full uniform all the while where roger has stripped off all but his ammunition belt and pistol holster
the big man shines a light beam down into the space
the floor is only seven feet or so below the window
there is absolutely nothing in sight clear floor clear walls all light grey
roger has moved to another window
roger hey over here
theres somethin here
peter trots over and shines his beam down
they see a vast array of cardboard cartons
hundreds of them
peter moves the light beam
now it illuminates a collection of large drums stacked floor to ceiling and running deep past the line of vision
on the face of each drum is the familiar symbol of a triangle within a circle and the letters c
peter civil defence
civil defence water supply
roger and boxes of canned food
steve how do we get down there
peter looks at stephen as a street wise tough would look at a hopeless city slick sissy
then the big man brings his rifle butt down against the glass and the shattered pane crashes to the floor below
inside the vast space is impressive
it is quite dark but for rays of sunlight which drift through the occasional skylights
we see an enormous quantity of food cartons and water drums it is very quiet
the space is barren except for the stacks of civil defence supplies
suddenly a figure drops out of one of the skylights landing on its feet in the sunray
it is peter
instantly he readies his rifle looking this way and that across the large room
he steps aside and roger climbs in
he too drops cat like to the floor
the two men instantly sling their rifles and move to the food cartons as by pre arranged plan
they carry the big boxes quickly one at a time to the spot under the open skylight
in a moment they have built a pyramid out of the cartons
it creates a kind of stairway for a quick escape through the window above
now fran lowers herself into the room and is able to climb down the cartons holding onto rogers hand
she is followed by an anxious stephen
peter has already wandered off
there are only two doors in the enormous room one at either end
the big trooper moves up to one of them as roger comes up behind him gun ready
peters hand turns the doorknob
it is unlocked and the big man gives roger a familiar nod
roger stands several feet back his rifle aimed directly at the door and ready to fire
then with a sudden commando like motion
peter throws the door open and ducks away flat against the wall
roger stiffens his finger all but pulling his trigger but there is no apparent danger
the door opens onto another vast room equivalent to the one the people are in
it also has stacks of c
the troopers cautiously move into the area through the door
the room is empty
the same sunrays pierce the darkness through skylights
all is dead quiet
this room has no doors at all but for the one peter opened
roger double damn
looks like a free lunch buddy
in the first room stephen has started to rip open one of the cartons
roger walks back into the room
roger you bring a can opener
roger then dont knock spam
its got its own key
the woman flips over the can in her hand and finds the little key
peter has walked right past the group
he is moving quickly toward the still unknown door at the other end of the room
again roger follows
at the door the two troopers go through the same s
the door swings open this time onto a very small space
again no immediate danger
as the men enter they discover that they are on the top landing of a concrete and metal firestair
there are no windows and the air is musty
there is one bare light bulb lit in the ceiling but down the stairs at the next landing it is quite dark and there the stairs wind even further down
they recede into blackness
roger whatdya think
the black man just stares first down into the darkness then back into the storage area
roger this is the only way up here
a great barricade of food cartons has been stacked against the stairway door
near the pyramid under the open skylight the group of refugees sits on the floor
stephen is asleep
fran sits next to his curled form her hand in his hair
roger leans against the pyramid and peter sits in the lotus position his gun across his legs squarely facing the suspicious stairwell
he and roger still pick at their food
roger swills water from an empty spam can which he has filled from one of the c
roger you better get some sleep too buddy
peter theres an awful lot of stuff down there that roger i know it
fran stiffens at the talk
she doesnt believe what she is hearing
she knows instantly that the men will try to raid the mall
peter theyre pretty spread out down there
roger hit and run
peter hit and run
maybe grab us off a radio
fran youre crazy
roger this place could be a gold mine
roger checks his weaponry and quickly moves toward the door where he begins to remove the barricade of cartons
peter still sits checking his own guns
fran this is exactly what were trying to get away peter the only problem at the airport was stray bullets
the exhausted pilot is sleeping through it all peter standing the big trooper bends over snatching up stephens rifle
he snaps off the safety and slams a shell into the chamber
he hands it to the woman
peter thats ready to shoot
fran holds the gun gingerly
peter the trigger squeezes real easy but the weaponll fran wait a minute i
peter anyone but us comes up them stairs you guys fran just stares up at the big man with desperation in her eyes
she has stopped arguing seeing that the troopers decision is made
peter if we dont show up after a few minutes
well catch up to you some other time
in the dimly lit firestair the door on the top landing pulls open suddenly
the stairway is still empty
the troopers move slowly out onto the landing
they look down into the darkness below
then they move slowly and silently down the steps
fran appears on the upper landing
she stands in the doorway clutching the rifle
peter stops for a moment looking back up at the frightened woman
peter youll probly hear some shooting
just dont panic ok
fran sighs exhaustedly
peter youll be alright
its our asses thats in two landings below there is almost no light
roger clicks on his flashlight and shines the beam around
he is in a very small concrete space
the stairs go down no further
there is only one door
peter eases down the steps behind
roger this is the only way up there
we see the other side of the metal door
it stands in another cement walled space which also seems small from our angle but it is fully lit
the door opens slowly and the troopers cautiously step out
as the camera swings around we see that the men are at the end of a long narrow hallway
directly across from them are two open supply rooms one containing a stationery sink and a toilet
both rooms are filled with cleaning supplies
down along the hall can be seen a dozen or so doorways
some doors are open some are closed
along the opposite wall there is nothing
the far end of the hall about a hundred yards away opens out onto the second story of the mall proper
the men look at one another and slowly move down the corridor
they try the first two doors which are locked
the third is wide open
roger ducks quickly into the room with his rifle raised
it is a large administrative office with rows of desks which are fully equipped for a staff of secretaries and accountants
the next room has a closed door but it is unlocked
peter swings the door open and silently jumps into the room
this is a much more spartan area with two metal desks and a few chairs
there are several phones
it is a maintenance office
on one wall is a large map of the mall with pin flags and scribbling over an acetate which covers the drawing
at the other end of the space is a huge electrical panel with circuit breakers and an entire series of master controls all keyed by a number code to another
map of the mall showing electrical installations
on the wall behind peter is a large blackboard and two metal cabinets
one is open
it contains all sorts of tools manual and electric
there are circuit testers walkie talkie units and there are several enormous rings containing hundreds of keys also colour and number coded
peter grabs up one of the rings and roger steps up behind him
roger the keys to the kingdom
back in the hallway rogers hand tries another doorknob and throws the door open
this opens onto beautifully plush offices obviously the executive headquarters
the rooms interconnect and while peter walks from door to door in the corridor roger moves through the inner doors meeting peter at each room
one office is more elegant than the next with the latest in designer furniture and expensive decorations
the troopers finally reach a room on which both the interior and corridor doors are closed and locked
the brass nameplate on the interior door reads c
roger moves out to the corridor where he joins peter
they move into the exterior corridor
they are very near the end of the hall and the brightly lit shopping area is close at hand
they can only see a small section
the balcony on their side is railed off against the open drop down to the first floor and across the great cavity they see the opposite balcony
on the far side only two store fronts can be seen
they are both gated and shut
the two realise what dangers might face them in the mall proper
they look at each other and move forward each clinging to opposite walls in the corridor
as they reach the mall proper they slowly and carefully peer around their respective corners
the upper balcony totally surrounds the vast interior of the building and at several points bridges across from one side to the other
little shops of all types run along the entire length of the balcony and at each far end stands the entrance arches for a large department store
most of the stores are gated but several seem open
the big department stores are gated and locked
here and there tall trees grow up from the ground floor and reach up into view of the second storey
there are none of the living dead evident on the balcony
the two troopers move slowly and quietly to the railing
the crouch and peer down through the bars of the rail
below the sight is even more spectacular
stores of every type offer gaudy displays of consumer items
everything from clothing to appliances
photo equipment audio and video outlets sporting goods and weaponry gourmet foods and natural organic foods
there is a book store a record store a real estate agency and a bank a novelty shop a gift shop all with the absolute latest in american consumer items
and at either end of the concourse like the main altars at each end of a cathedral stand the mammoth two storey department stores great symbols of a consumer society
down the centre of the ground floor along with the gardens and park benches are little stalls
one is a tobacco specialist another jewellery another is a small photo portrait stall where mothers had their children photographed
there are restaurants and snack bars and numerous coin operated machines selling everything from childrens toys to blood pressure readings
there is a large turntable designed to spin but which is now still holding a late model car on exhibit
another turntable displays futuristic household appliances
the images are all too familiar but in their present state they appear as an archaeological discovery revealing the gods and customs of a civilisation now gone
the ghosts of a civilisation however are not figments in the mind
they are quite real
and they walk below in the aisles of the great cathedral
at least twenty zombies can be seen from the troopers perspective
roger its christmastime down there buddy
peter fat city brother
how we gonna work it
roger we get into the department stores up here
they probly have their own escalators inside
peter lets check those keys
the troopers stealthily pull away from the railing and back into the administrative corridor
then they move quickly down the hall toward the maintenance office
as the men leave the balcony the camera pans
several yards away a zombie staggers out of one of the open stores
it is followed by a second creature a female without one arm
they are moving along the balcony toward the open corridor
in the maintenance office the troopers are checking the keys against the coded map on the wall
roger seventy two
here it is
the men check the keys
peter finds corresponding numbers
roger lets just hope its right
peter look here on the map these numbers must all be locks he points front
back outside the man points to several numbered spots which seem to be within the big department store they are studying
roger moves off toward the electrical control panel
peter still stares at the map
peter i guess these gotta be the gates
roger how about a little music
the big black moves up behind his partner
one of the controls on the panel is marked music tape
it indicates a master switch which is in the off position
another is marked floor exhibits and a series of others are marked escalators
there are dozens of master switches which are in the off mode
peter power switches
roger the music might cover the noise we make
peter hit em all
might as well have power in everything
we might need it
roger hits the switches one at a time
throughout the mall we hear the drone of the dull mass produced music designed to lull a shoppers brain
upstairs francine startles at the sound from below
she snaps the rifle into her hands ready to fire
she has been standing just inside the storage area
she steps into the firestair and looks down into the darkness
the sounds of the insipid music drift up to her
she leans into the storage area again
steve still lying on the floor against the escape pyramid slowly awakens
down on the first floor of the big mall things begin to work
the automobile turntable starts spinning the great escalators move up and sown
two of the living dead caught just starting up two stalled escalator fall and roll down as the mechanical steps begin moving
lights blink on the exhibits and mechanical window displays begin their robot like motions
it is like a carnival coming alive
the zombies which wander the floor look about in confusion
some of them swat ineffectively at the moving exhibits
in a very tall cage which reaches from the first floor all the way to the ceiling the tropical birds which are housed within begin to flutter and squawk
in a pet shop there are puppies and kittens in a window display
they whine and scramble over one another in fright at the noise and the motion and the coloured lights
on one of the floor exhibits a rear projection movie starts
it is a dryly produced film about the merits of a real estate developers new tract of suburban houses
a narrator speaks in a friendly voice and for prices which anyone can afford you can live in these luxurious new homes by brandon
fully electric central air
in the maintenance office the troopers ready themselves for their raid
peter secures the vital key ring to his utility belt and the move out
peter and roger move down the hall and exit through door to exterior corridor
just as roger moves through the door into the corridor he is confronted by the zombies from the balcony
he startles and ducks back into the room
the closest zombie is reaching out with clutching hands
peter raises his gun and fires two shots cleanly through the creatures head
as the shots ring through the area fran standing at the top of the firestair startles
steve grabs the rifle from the woman
steve jesus christ
the troopers step over the corpse
the second zombie the arm less female is walking toward them
this time roger fires his weapon
the creature falls in a heap
roger whatdya think
bag it or try for it
peter you game
roger nods and the two men run down the hall toward the mall
their rifles poised they are like commandos on an important mission
the men at the mall mouth see the department store and start for it
they run from the corridor onto the balcony
the battle to win the mall has begun
the creatures which wander the first floor look about attracted by the sound but they are confused
they walk this way and that in mis guided staggering strides
several of the zombies try to move up the down escalator
they fall over themselves and cannot negotiate the moving stairway
a few creatures who move onto the up escalator also fall against each other from the movement but one falls onto the moving steps and is carried upward
then another manages to keep its balance holding on to the hand rail
at another point down the length of the mall there is a stationary stairway which runs from the first to the second floor
several creatures move up the steps
at the top of the firestair stephen begins to move down the steps cautiously
his rifle is at the ready
fran stays on the top landing
fran stephen dont go down there
he continues steve its alright
at the huge gate which locks off the big department store the two troopers come to a crashing stop
there is a side concourse which can be seen from this vantage point and in the hall are four or five zombies
they are about three hundred feet away
roger keeps his rifle levelled off in the direction of the creatures while peter confronts the lock at the middle of the big roll gate
he fumbles with the keys for a moment until he finally sinks the proper key into the receptacle which is right at the floor
the tumblers turn successfully
on the escalator the creatures which fell onto the moving steps are being carried up to the balcony
the one supporting himself on the hand rail is still standing
the head of the standing zombie suddenly becomes visible from rogers perspective
the trooper raises his gun and aims for the creatures forehead
peter tries to life the roll gate
it wont move
it is still locked
peter you bastard
peter still locked
he sees another assembly the big man moves to the far side of the gate
the same key fits
roger re focuses on the creature which is riding the escalator
it is quite near the top now
roger is about to shoot when something catches his eye
the fallen zombies which up to now could not be seen behind the escalator rail wall suddenly come tumbling out onto the balcony floor
roger fires but his aim is inaccurate
he hits the standing zombie in the neck
the creature is thrown off balance enough to lose its footing
it falls back down the escalator but before it reaches the bottom it stops rolling
the steps carry it back up toward the second floor again
it is still very much alive
the two creatures on the balcony struggle to stand
roger looks back over his shoulder
the zombies from the side concourse are now about a hundred and fifty feet away
peter turns the key in the lock but again the gate will not lift
it moves slightly as the middle mechanism and the one on the far right are free but there is a third lock on the far left
peter moves to it quickly
on the first floor concourse other creatures are beginning to take note of the action upstairs
they start to move
the zombies on the stationary stairway are beginning to reach the second floor but they are far down the main balcony
they will have to pass the administrative corridor in order to reach the department store
roger fires again
one of the nearby zombies falls in a heap
at the sound of the rifle fran gets desperate
for gods sake
lets get up on the roof
steve is at the middle landing
he stares down into the darkness below
more gunfire can be heard from the mall
steve its alright im tellin ya
those things dont move fast enough to catch us
more gunfire can be heard
now the giant gate rolls up with a loud rumble
peter ducks into the store even as the gate is still rising but the inertia of the great metal cage carries the lip up out of peters grasp
he jumps to try to catch it but he misses
it jerks up into its fully open position and rolls back down slightly but still peter cannot reach the lip
it slides back to rest about three feet above peters fingertips
the zombies advance
roger drops another with a clean shot through the head then he backs into the archway of the department store entrance
peter is desperately looking around for something to stand on to reach the gate
the zombies are very close to the arch now advancing steadily
peter grabs a small counter used to display shoes but it is too heavy for him to move himself
roger has to abandon his post at the arch long enough to help drag the little counter
the men drag it to a point just at the side of the open arch and peter instantly jumps up on the top of it
at that instant a zombie rounds the corner and grabs at peters legs
the big man kicks startled and the motion causes him to fall off the little counter
he lands on his feet but out on the balcony beyond the arch
roger brings his rifle butt around against the creatures head and the zombie falls back but is not dead
other creatures are only a few feet from peter whose gun sits on the little counter inside the store
roger levels off his rifle but cannot fire as peter is in the line
peter makes a move and like a football player jukes to the left then to the right
he dives right at one of the creatures carrying it into the store
now roger fires dropping one then another
peter jumps back up on the counter
peter behind you
the creature in the store has crashed against a cosmetics display and is regaining its footing
roger turns and fires
the creature falls
peter grabs the lip of the roll gate and starts to bring it down
there are several creatures right in the archway now they clutch with their hands
one blocks the downward progress of the gate
roger fires point blank and the zombie flies back
the gate lowers but is stopped by the clutching hands of other creatures
roger grabs the cage now and helps to pull it down
peter still gripping the lip jumps off the counter to get more leverage
the bottom of the gate is now four feet from the floor
the two men are able to move it steadily downward
the zombies are very weak but more creatures appear making it more difficult
then one zombie tries to crawl under the gate
its torso just gets through as the gate slams down against its chest
its arms grab for peters legs and its mouth is gasping
its body is preventing the gate from engaging in the floor mechanisms
roger lets go the cage as peter tries to hold it against the creatures outside
grabbing his rifle roger brings the butt straight down on the clutching zombies skull
the zombie goes limp
then roger tries to push the creature clear of the gate but the pressure is too great
roger let up a little
let up a little
the gate rises a few inches
more zombies appear outside
their hands clutch at the roll gate
the openings in the grid are only big enough for their fingers their hands cant reach through but they are pushing the gate higher and higher
more than peter intended to clear the obstructing corpse
with his rifle butt roger manages to push the dead zombie clear except for one of its arms
from outside a creatures hand suddenly grabs rogers weapon
for a moment its like a tug o war
peter is having a harder time holding the gate
it is inching upward
peter come on
roger lets go his gun barrel and the weapon is snatched away by the creature in the crowd
roger grabs for the gate
peter the arm
that arms in the way
roger squats again and manages to throw the dead zombies arm clear
then he grabs the gate again
now it starts to move down more steadily
at the last moment another clutching arm juts into the store but when the gate hits it it withdraws and the big cage clicks solidly into place
the two troopers step back from the gate
the creatures still moan and gurgle slamming against the gate their fingers clutching at the grid but they are unable to budge it
there are ten or twelve zombies trying to get into the department store and several others are making their way along the balcony
at least six lie dead along the floor
now how the hell we gonna get back
peter lets go shoppin first
the two men back into the aisles of the store
the creatures outside still push and claw at the gate
the one with rogers rifle uses it as a bludgeon but it has no effect
stephen opens the door into the administration corridor
from his perspective the hall is inactive
he observes the washrooms and the long row of doors to the various offices
he starts into the corridor letting the firestair door close
at the top of the firestair fran can see the beam of light from the open door below
as the door closes the beam narrows then it blinks out with a click as the door closes
she is very frightened
she backs into the storage area
she moves quickly to the pyramid of cartons which lead to the roof
she sits on the bottom carton biting her fingers
in the department store roger is riding down an escalator
he has found a back pack and it is obviously already filled with goods
as he steps off the moving stairs on the ground floor the surroundings are eerily quiet
he moves through a clothing department
we see the dead looking faces of store mannequins
roger runs into one and is greatly startled
he snatches up a lined windbreaker and ties it around his waist by its arms then he trots off down another aisle where he finds peter
the big trooper has a radio under his arm and he is snatching up a small television
roger hey man we cant carry all this shit
peter turns a corner and dumps the articles into something which we cannot yet see
as roger trots up he sees that peter has a big gardening cart already heaped with goods
were gonna just wheel right by em right
peter we gonna try brother
we aint doin this roger theres no way this is gonna happen
even though he doesnt understand the plan roger helps peter toss things into the barrow
they race down the hardware aisle tossing in tools and other supplies
electrical cables flashlights batteries
they scoop things up like contestants on a game show who have five minutes in a store to grab whatever they can
stephen is in the maintenance office
he examines the maps and electrical equipment then rummages through a desk
at the open end of the corridor leading to the second storey balcony zombies wander past as they head for the store entrance where many creature still claw at the
the zombies move randomly
some are leaving the gate as their prey is now out of sight
they begin to wander here and there
three of the creatures turn into the administrative corridor and start toward the offices
stephen has found a large binder in the desk
it contains all the plans for the mall duplicating the charts on the walls and many others
it is a complete maintenance manual revealing all the workings and layout of the huge structure
elevator doors slide open with a loud whoosh
the two troopers appear in the car wheeling their barrow out onto the second storey aisles of the big store
now they can see the roll gate and the creatures pushing at it ineffectively
they roll their barrow very close to the gate
when the zombies catch sight of the humans their efforts are renewed
they moan and push harder at the gate
they troopers leave the barrow disappearing back to the aisles
they run onto the interior escalator bounding down faster than the moving steps then they run across the first floor until they see the lower level roll gate
there are creatures wandering the concourse but none of them are at the gate
peter lets go brother
the old okey doke
the men move up to the roll gate
a zombie lumbers past
roger speaks to the creature
roger hey ugly
the creature turns instantly
then dives for the gate with a moaning roar
its mouth opens and its hands clutch
the gate pops forward from the creatures thrust but it holds tightly
the action causes roger to jump even though there is no immediate danger
peter lets raise some hell
he is shouting roger over here
lets go over here
other creatures along the concourse turn toward the department store
they lumber along attracted by the sounds
at the gate several zombies push at the metal grids
the troopers back away but stay in sight of the creatures
peter just give it time
give it time
upstairs the zombies at the upper gate are attracted by the commotion below
they begin to move away from the gate and lumber along the balcony to the stairways and escalators
in the maintenance office stephen still rummages
he finds a loaded hand gun and stuffs it in his belt
he moves to the large cabinets containing the walkie talkies and the keys
in the corridor the stray zombies move in and out of the executive offices as they draw nearer to the maintenance room
several creatures fall over one another as they try to move down the up escalator
the down escalator push others onto the first floor
they scramble to their feet and move toward the department store
in the concourse many creatures are moving toward the gate
already there are a dozen or so clutching and pushing at the metal grid
through the crowd
peter can see several other creatures lumbering down the stationary steps
they re comin
the big man readies his walkie talkie pulling the antenna out
peter go on up
stay outta sight but lemme know when its clear enough
roger clutching his walkie talkie disappears among the aisles as he runs crouching into the store
peter tries to hold the attention of the creatures at the gate
peter right here babies
this is where its at
upstairs the doors to the elevator glide open again and roger moves through the second floor aisles stealthily
stephen takes the maintenance manual and leaves the office
he walks down the interior corridor and opens the door to the exterior corridor
as the door opens the zombies attack
the zombies clutch as stephen tries to close the door on zombie s arm
stephen then runs back down the interior corridor
stephen starts up the firestair to the door
just then he hears fran call out
realising he will lead the creatures to her he closes the door and moves toward the maintenance office and runs in
stephen runs into the office and slams the door
a second creature is moving up behind the first and another enters the corridor from the accounting office
the metal door locks only with a key
stephen fumbles for a moment with his rifle then dives for the key cabinet
there are hundreds of keys on rings
he looks at the wall map
he cant focus in his panic
in the hall the first creature slams against the floor
it doesnt even have the intelligence to reach for the knob
it pounds on the door with its hands
the pounding increases stephens panic
he stares at the map trying to focus on the maze of numbers
the second creature reaches the door and claws at it
the third approaches slowly
stephen rattles among the keys
his fingers shake and he cannot decipher the numbers
outside one of the creatures in its random clutching takes hold of the knob and pushes in and out not yet turning it
stephen clutching one of the rings throws himself against the door still trying to read the numbers
the knob finally turns
the door opens against stephens weight
he manages to slam it shut despite the pushing creatures
he throws the key ring down and grabs his gun
roger speaks into his walkie talkie roger i think we can move the wagon
peter downstairs talks into his unit peter clear
roger over talking unit the creatures slam against the first floor gate but it holds securely
peter stares at the beasts as he lowers his talk unit
he backs slowly away into the depths of the store
upstairs roger peers from behind a counter
the second floor gate is clear
on the balcony several creatures wander aimlessly but most of them have already moved down the steps and escalators
peter is still in sight of the zombies at the first floor entrance
he clips his talk unit onto his belt then ducks and disappears among the aisles
he runs crouching out of sight until he rounds a far wall and comes up into the elevator
he enters the car and pushes
the doors glide shut and the car begins to move up
at the door of the maintenance office the knob turns again
the door pushes open against stephen weight
his feet slide on the linoleum floor
he cannot get the door closed this time
biting his lip he makes the sign of the cross and backs suddenly into the room holding his rifle high
the door flies open with a slam and three zombies advance into the office
stephen tries to aim carefully and he fires
just as the elevator doors open
peter hears the gunfire
he hesitates for a moment then runs toward the entrance arch
roger is poised at one of the side locks on the gate
the gunfire stops him also as he is unlocking the mechanism
along the balcony some of the creatures turn around in con fusion
they walk this way and that attracted by the sound
peter thunders up behind roger
peter what the hell is that
roger fuzz maybe
peter or maybe flyboy
wheres it comin from
roger cant tell
peter come on
roger maybe we should see whats happenin
peter open up
i can get the wagon over
if it roger moves to the second lock
peter setting his weapon on the floor roger moves to the third lock as peter stands and grabs on to the handles of the barrow
the body of a dead zombie hits the floor its head shot through
nearby lies the corpse of the first creature to break into the maintenance office
the third staggers into the room
stephen stands fast now
he holds his rifle out in front of him
the creature walks toward the gun
steve holds his hands on the trigger
the zombie lunges suddenly and grabs the gun barrel
steve fires but the blast tears through the creatures chest
steve struggles to raise the barrel but the motion of the zombie makes it impossible to aim accurately
the gun fires again this time grazing the zombies neck
with a sudden burst of energy the creature wrenches the gun free
steve backs against the wall
the creature tosses the rifle across the room where it slams the floor near a desk
the zombie advances on steve
steve is next to the key cabinet and grabs at it trying to find some weapon
he feels the tools in the cabinet and comes up with a hammer
the zombie is about to reach him when steve pulls the hammer out and upsets the cabinet
the zombie fumbles with the cabinet at its feet but doesnt fall
steve tries to hit the creatures head with the tool he misses and the zombie grabs at his arm trying to bite it
steve wrenches free and the two bodies fall to the floor
the creature clutches at the mans legs its teeth bared like an animal
steve kicks desperately and manages to land a blow squarely in the creatures face
the zombie comes after him again and from his crawling position steve brings the hammer as an uppercut to the creatures jaw
the creature falls back enough for steve to crawl across the floor
it follows but steve reaches the desk and grabs his rifle
rolling on the floor he fires several shots into the creature finally destroying it
the second floor gate rolls up with a rumble and peter runs out of the department store with the barrow full of supplies
the action attracts the attention of several of the creatures which are still wandering the balcony
they turn slowly
just as he rounds the corner
peter almost collides with one creature and can barely keep from upsetting the barrow
he manages to get past and he runs as fast as he can toward the opening of the administrative corridor
roger does not let the gate roll up too high
he stabilises the metal grid well within reach then he stands his post with peters rifle
several creatures approach from the opposite direction
roger fires at the closest one
the others are still too far away to waste bullets
stephen steps over the corpses in the office and grabs the maintenance manual
he rushes into the corridor and runs out
three more creatures move toward him up the hallway
at first stephen freezes then he starts backing toward the firestair his rifle poised
just as peter is reaching the mouth of the corridor a zombie steps out of the hallway into his path
peter slams the barrow squarely into the creatures legs
the zombie falls in the barrow onto the supplies
the big man slams the load against a wall at the mouth of the corridor
before the zombie can get its balance the big trooper reaches down and grabs the creatures jacket lapels
with all his might he flings the creature out against the balcony railing
the creature flips over the rail but does not fall
its arms and legs flailing as peter comes up quickly behind and flips it over the rail
the creature makes no sound as it plummets to the concourse below
roger fires again at a zombie drawing dangerously near
other creatures throughout the area are again converging on the department store entrance
peter wheels the barrow into the corridor and sees steve at the other end the three zombies are still closing in
peter hold it flyboy
he can barely see peter his vision blocked by the zombies
the creatures are about thirty feet away
peter dont go into the stairway
stephen is confused
the creatures advance
peter dont open that door baby
youll lead em steve is on the verge of panic
peter run for it
run this way
the zombies are drawing closer and closer
peter come on man
run this way
you can run right steve sizes up the corridor
it is narrow but there is room to run past the zombies
peter come on flyboy
you can make it
with a sudden move steve breaks into a run
he passes the first creature easily
the second grabs him as he runs past but the man keeps his footing even though he slams against the wall
he keeps moving forward
the third creatures stands in his path
steve lowers his head and slams into the zombies chest
the creature flies back and falls
steve falls and tumbles toward the mouth of the passageway
he regains his footing as the creatures turn to pursue him he runs to the end of the hall where peter waits
head for the department store
the two men run across the balcony
they slam into two other zombies which clutch and grab at them without success
at the entrance arch to the store roger fires at another creature
other zombies are approaching but steve and peter dive into the arch and the three men manage to lower the gate without a problem
the zombies converge on the area as they did before clutching and pushing at the metal cage which holds them out securely
the men breathe heavily as they back away from the gate
peter downstairs again
the men move through the aisles of the store and go crashing down the escalator
on the first floor they run toward the lower gate where they pull up wheezing with exhaustion
steve what do we do
roger let em know were here
shouting whoooo hoooooo
steve starts to laugh at the ludicrous situation
peter smiles at the young pilot
peter you did alright this time flyboy
stephen laughs some more nervously at first then whole heartedly
then he lets out a loud steve whooooooooooopeeeeeeeee
he has joined the cowboys
he is like a child almost exultant with the joy of their victory
the three men shout through the cage at the creatures which are already gathering at the gate
out on the concourse a few zombies wander aimlessly but most are heading for the commotion on the first floor arch
on the upstairs balcony zombies again move toward the stationary steps and the escalators
the three creatures in the administration corridor move toward the open mall
two walk out on the balcony but the last one turns into an open office
then it staggers back out and heads down the hall toward the firestair
fran can faintly hear the whooping of the men as she moves toward the stairway door which is still open
she steps onto the landing and looks down into the darkness
the shouting stops
desperate with fear she moves back to the storage room then back onto the landing
now her fear turns into anger
she takes a few steps down the stairs
goes back up
fran god dammit
she starts back down again
in the corridor below the creature walks into another office
then it moves back into the hall
the zombies crash against the first floor gate
the men crouch in the shadows of the gate
roger we just gotta wait longer before we move
theres always a chance of some of them roger yeah but we can handle that
we can break through
peter if any of them see or hear us theyll just roger we can sure as hell out run em
load up what peter im thinkin maybe we got a good thing goin here
maybe we shouldnt be in such a hurry to leave
roger oh man
peter if we could get back up there without them catchin on we could hole up for a while
check out the radio
see whats happenin
roger man i dont know
steve theres some kind of passageway over the top the troopers look at the young pilot almost surprised to hear him speak
he has been quiet up until now
steve i dont know if its just heating ducts or peter upstairs
the three move off down the aisles then duck out of sight around a corner
the zombies clutch at the metal gate moaning and rattling the grid loudly
in the maintenance hallway we see the thick manual lying on the floor
a lumbering foot kicks it as the zombie in the corridor wanders into another office
the creature ignores the book as it does the corpses strewn in the hall
in the fire stair fran is on the middle landing
she is suddenly overcome with a wave of nausea
she clutches at her stomach retching
she sits on the landing letting her head flop against the wall
she is almost in tears
the upstairs doors of the department store elevator open and the men trot out
as they clear a wall they see the entrance arch
there are no zombies at the gate but two are seen drifting along the balcony outside
peter watch it
dont let em see you
the men move stealthily along the aisles
they look up at the ceiling and see a series of large grillwork panels
peter shines his flashlight beam into one
the ceiling is about twelve feet high but the light beam penetrates the grille to reveal a fairly large space above
roger looks big enough to crawl through
peter theyre locked
thats those other lock numbers we steve why the hell would they be locked
peter jackpot flyboy
peter theyre locked because you can get through em easy from other parts of the building
steve over here
steve notices that one of the ceiling grids is very close to the elevators
peter looks at the grids then down at the double doors
peter the elevator shaft
he moves over and hits the button
the doors open
peter hold em
roger stands against the rubber safety bumper holding the car doors open wide
peter steps onto the hand railing and reaches up for the escape hatch which is held in place by four knub headed bolts
he removes the bolts quickly and dislodges the hatch cover and passes it down to stephen
then the big man sticks his head up through the opening
he looks around the elevator shaft shining his flash this way and that
he sees another grid in the shaft wall
peter its here
and it aint locked
get a screw roger i know where the tools are
get one of those roger ducks off down an aisle and steve moves to the nearby furniture department and grabs a lightweight lamp table
the elevator doors close
when steve returns with the table he has to hit the button again
the doors open
peter is already climbing out of the car into the shaft
steve uses the table to hold the doors open and goes to get another
this time he gets a larger coffee table and sets it under the opening in the car and puts the smaller table on top
he climbs up and sticks his head out into the shaft
the doors close again
in the greasy black shaft amid the cables and elevator mechanisms
peter examines the wall grid with his flashlight
peter its alright
we can get it off
even though he speaks softly peters voice has an eerie echoing sound in the narrow shaft
the car doors open
steve ducks down to see roger bearing a screwdriver and pliers along with some other tools in a shopping bag
roger one stop shopping
anything you need right at your fingertips
steve relays the tools up to peter who immediately begins to work on the screws which mount the grid
he passes the flashlight to steve who holds the beam on the work area
fran sits in the stairwell her hand over her mouth
it is very quiet for a moment then she hears a slight clicking
her head snaps to attention
she stares down at the bottom landing
there is a thump at the door
slowly the woman stands to her feet her eyes transfixed on the door below
the door starts to open
light creeps in
the slow lumbering figure of the zombie moves into the firestair
choking back a scream fran turns and runs up the stairs
the creature below follows unsure of itself in the dim light
at the top fran makes it into the storage area and slams the door
for a moment she just backs away in terror
then she gathers her wits and moves to drag the food cartons over as a barricade
she struggles with one of the cartons
it is very heavy and so large she cannot get a good grip
the smooth cardboard slips in her hands
the zombie has almost reached the middle landing
roger looks down through a ceiling grid
he sees the interior of a sporting goods store
along one wall is an arsenal of the latest weaponry for the sportsman
roger sweet jesus
peter i seen it
the men are in a large ductwork which seems to run along the entire length of the mall
they move as quietly as they can
there are several side tunnels branching off in both directions
steve passes another ceiling grid and looks down
he sees a full equipped radio and electronics shop
roger i hope you know where youre goin buddy
peter who is leading fran struggles with the carton
she gets it against the door finally and moves to haul another
the zombie has reached the top landing and makes for the door
before the woman can bring another carton over she sees the door move
she throws herself against it but cant plant her feet well because of the carton of the floor
the door moves an inch at a time
the creatures hand reaches into the room
it clutches at the edge of the door
fran panics and runs back towards the escape pyramid where she turns and faces the door
the creature is straining against the weight of the carton
now now both its hands clutch the door edge
the carton moves another inch
now the creatures head can be seen as it strains to get through the widening space
frans eyes are wide almost hypnotised
she looks for something to use as a weapon
the room is bare but for the cartons and water drums
she is about to opt for the skylight when she glimpses rogers knap sack in the shadows
she runs for it as the creature finally breaks into the big room
the womans hands tremble as she rummages through the cloth sack
she dumps the contents out ammunition mace cans batteries flares
she nervously grabs one of the cylinders and her shaking hands try to deal with the paper wrapping
the zombie moans as it draws closer
it is approaching the pyramid of cartons
fran manages to free the wrapping and snaps the cylinder in two at the mark
now the zombie is between her and the pyramid cutting off her immediate route
it is very near
fran backs away a few steps as she tries to strike the flare head on the small striker on the cylinder cap
it doesnt fire
she tries again
now the zombie has reached the knap sack
it kicks through the items and knocks and rolls the other flares
frans flare finally catches with a great whoosh the bright flame startling the woman as well as the zombie
the creatures eyes go wide and it brings its arms up to avoid the brightness
the intense white flame casts an eerie light over the creature and throws the zombies enormous shadow against the cartons and wall
the creature backs away a few steps almost tripping over the articles on the floor
fran manages to advance close enough to snatch two extra cylinders and skirt around the zombie in a wide arc
the creature swats the air keeping distance but threatening
fran considers the firestair door but decides on the pyramid
she circles around to a point where she can climb up from behind the moaning zombie
she rushes for the cartons and climbs but loses her footing while trying to hold the flares and crashes into the topmost carton
it starts to slide off the pyramid and tumbles to the floor almost crashing into the zombie
the creature starts to clutch at the pyramid
the stack of cartons is now too short and fran can reach the skylight but cant pull herself up
she accidentally drops two flares including the lit one
it tumbles to the floor behind the pyramid where it no longer offends the zombies eyes
now the creature tries to climb to the woman
fran grabs the last flare in her mouth and reaches with both hands for the skylight
she lifts with all her might and her feet come off the cartons but she cannot pull herself up
as she tries to lower her feet back to the cartons the pyramid shakes and wobbles from the zombie
the creature is making progress its hands can almost touch frans foot
peter drops out of a ceiling grid into a plush office
rogers legs appear through the grid and he too swings down holding on with his hands to soften his landing
suddenly we are aware of a third person on the room in the large chair at the desk
roger startles and grabs his gun
peter just stares
they are in the presidents office
some days earlier the president shot himself in the head
peter come on
steve struggles overhead
peter just drop i got you
steve i cant
peter to roger the two troopers grab the desk and slide it away from the presidents corpse
the action causes the chair to spin slightly and his wide terrified eyes seem to watch the action
the desk in place
steves toes can reach its surface
he loses his balance slightly and pulls back up
he kicks a picture frame off the desk onto the floor shattering the glass over photos of the presidents wife and children
peter come on
steve finally gets footing on the desktop and lowers himself down
he stares at the corpse as roger helps him off the desk
peter is already unlocking the door to the corridor
he opens it a crack and peeks out
the corridor is empty
he sees the door at the end which leads to the exterior corridor
as the other men come up behind peter opens the door quietly and slips into the hall
he starts to walk quickly toward the door to the exterior corridor
roger follows as stephen moves backwards toward the fire stairs
peters hands grab the barrow and pulls the cart down the corridor backwards so as to face the mall opening
in the corridor steve clutches the maintenance manual
peter backs slowly up the hall
the wheels squeak and the big man bites his lip
roger kicks the last corpse to the wall
steve notices that the fire stairs door is open wide
steve jesus christ
he bounds towards the door
roger spins to see what happened
peter turns and quickens his pace
steve trots up the steps
roger to peter peter runs with the cart the last few yards
as he gets to the doorway roger breaks up the steps
steve breaks into the storage area
he drops the manual
the woman turns in steves direction
the zombie swats the flare out of frans hand
she startles and the cartons feel as though they will topple
she steadies herself with both hands
the creature is grabbing at her legs
steve raises his rifle and moves in for a close shot
roger dont shoot
theyll hear ya
roger arrives and the two men charge the pyramid
the creature is still clutching at fran
she kicks violently as roger pulls the back of the zombies clothing
the zombie falls and hits the floor
as it kneels up steve swings the butt of his rifle and smashes it into the things head
then roger delivers a blow with his gun straight down
steve rushes to fran
she falls off the cartons into his arms sobbing and choking
are you alright
the woman is incoherent
she is clutching at her stomach
peter appears in the doorway carrying the tv and several other items
he dumps them on the floor
peter lets get this stuff up come on
roger is dragging the dead zombie to the door
peter comes to help and fran starts to wretch
steve tries to calm her
he gets some water in a can and brings it over
come on its ok
are you downstairs at the exterior corridor peter peeks out
he can see the mall at the far end
the coast is clear
he and roger hurriedly carry the corpse into the hall and roll it onto the floor and retreat back into the fire stairs
peter holds open the door slightly and watches the corridor for a moment
convinced theyve not been seen he closes the door
peter i think were ok brother
they grab more supplies from the barrow and start upstairs
steve still tries to comfort fran
steve were ok
were all ok
we got a lot in the background the two troopers bring their load of supplies into the big room and deposit them near the tv
then they go downstairs for another load
steve this is a terrific place
this place the woman still cannot stop sobbing and retching
now the enormous barricade of food cartons is stacked against the door again
it is quiet except for the little noises of eating and occasional rustle of paper
we also head a faint electronic whistle but we do not recognise it
as we see more of the room we find our refugees sitting near the reconstructed pyramid on the floor
peter seems to be asleep up against the pyramid
roger is nibbling at delicacies from the department stores gourmet department
their loot is laid around them on the floor
roger as he eats is leafing through the maintenance manual
there is a stack of tools some still in wrapping electric razors still boxed some clothing articles the radio which also plays small cassettes
there are soaps toiletries pens pencils and notebooks flashlights cigarettes and several decks of cards with a canister of chips
the items are clearly not all functional
some are representative of the luxuries considered necessary by a consumer society
they are all bathed in the blue glow from the television which stephen tries to tune in
its power cable is spliced into the leads of a bare light fixture overhead
fran cannot be seen at first
roger what the hell time is it anyway
steve only about nine
roger and nothing
referring to the tv on the screen we see the civil defence logo and realise that the high pitched electronic signal is coming from the tv set
steve as long as were getting the pattern roger snaps on the large battery powered radio
he rolls the dial getting nothing but static
finally he hears a signal and tunes it in
a badly modulated voice is droning through the interference
it sounds like a war correspondent sending a signal from very far away
reports that communications with detroit roger philly
steve i know j
s is out by now
it was a madhouse peters eyes suddenly blink open
none of the rest of his body moves the others do not realise he is awake
the big man stares at stephen who is getting emotionally excited about their exploits as a team
steve we knocked the shit out of em and they peter they touched us good flyboy
were lucky the other men look at peter
the radio drones on with more disaster reports
peter you get overconfident
underestimate those peter speaks in a low unemotional tone
stephen is transfixed
peter they got a big advantage over us brother
we see frans face
she is listening
there is no answer audible
a tear rolls down the womans cheek
the radio drones
after a time steve appears
he is surprised to find the woman awake
she sits on a new blanket from the store
another is rolled up as a pillow
she wipes away her tears with her cigarette still in her hand
the man kneels next to her not knowing what to say
stephen sits down next to her and puts his hands on her shoulders
fran so i guess we forget about canada right
steve taking her in his arms fran i guess nobody cares about my vote huh
steve come on frannie you were sleeping
fran what happened to growing vegetables and fishing
she leans in to him making a final plea
fran stephen lets just take what we need and keep steve we cant hardly carry anything in that little bird
fran angry cut to a close up of peters face
his eyes pop open
peter shut that thing off
roger clicks off the radio
they hear slight sounds coming from the fire stairs
the end of the room with the barricade of cartons looks surreal in the blue glow of the tv screen which still shines
roger crawls over and clicks the tv off as well
the electronic whistle slowly dies
steve steps out from behind the wall of cartons
fran peers around the corner to look but she still sits on the floor
the faint squeaking of the door to the bottom of the steps
then footsteps on the metal stairs
the faces of the humans all tighten
peter and roger pull their rifles
roger makes his ready
some thumping in the hall
steve squats down and holds fran
the sounds are closer now
the door behind the cartons clicks but does not move
after a time the footsteps recede down the stairs
peter somebody better sit watch all the time
roger theyll never get through there
peter enough of em will
and it aint just them things roger what are they gonna do
land another pilot to fly peter somebody finally got it though
it comes down to fran ducks back onto her blanket
she disgustedly lights another cigarette
steve sits next to her again
she doesnt respond
steve dammit fran you know how many times wed stephen curls up with his head on the rolled blanket
steve come on
get some sleep
the woman doesnt move
she grinds her cigarette out on the concrete floor and stretches out next to the man
he puts his arm around her
his hands rub up and down her body as he curls next to her
he opens her blouse and reaches inside
he closes his eyes and he seems perfectly comfortable to rest in her softness
his hand moves under her clothing
she doesnt respond at first then her body relaxes somewhat and she brings one of her arms up around his head
steve im not just being stubborn
i really think this she stares off across the barren room
his hands continues to move under her blouse
in the administration corridor a few stray zombies wander among the corpses on the floor
one large and severely wounded creature pounds on the door to the interior corridor
it had been the one which was pounding at the door upstairs
a female zombie squats near one of the corpses in the hall
she lifts its arm and moves it to her mouth but she drops it quickly repelled by its coldness
she leans over and picks at another corpse then she stands and drifts towards the mall
slowly the creatures leaves the corridor and move out onto the second floor balcony
we begin to hear a voice fading in over the scene
not actually cannibalism
cannibalism in the we see the mall balcony now
zombies wander past the stores
some move down the stationary stairs onto the main concourse
voice they attack and
only on warm human at the mall entrances some creatures drift out into the night
others still enter the enormous building
there are not as many as there were in the afternoon but there are certainly enough to be threatening
seemingly little or no reasoning several creatures are clawing at the roll gate to the department store
it is a strange and eerie sight
the staring painted eyes of the mannequins within the store seem to watch the zombies
the gate rattles but does not budge
voice there are reports of the creatures using tools frans eyes pop open the voice has awakened her
she has been asleep on the blanket
voice these creatures are nothing but pure motorised the woman looks around
morning sunlight is spilling in through the skylights above
she sits up and peers into the next area of the room
the men are gone
the television is playing
on the tube we see a dishevelled man sitting in an emergency news room reading the report
voice their only drive is for the food which sustains fran sees that the barricade of cartons is still in place at the fire stairs door
she looks up
the skylight above the pyramid is open
she realises that the men are on the roof
at the edge of the roof peter looks through binoculars
about a quarter of a mile away he sees the large warehouse of a food processing chain
in the yard and in the large open garages of the building he sees a fleet on enormous trailer trucks parked
steve you sure we can start em
roger you havent spent enough time on the street
peter well lets get it up
theres not too many the big trooper looks down to the parking lot below
there are not as many zombies as there were the day before and they wander aimlessly spread out rather than in clusters
the men move for the skylight
in the storage area below fran is examining the maps in the manual
the tv still drones in a low volume
the men climb down into the room
roger hey fran
fran i would have made coffee and breakfast but i there is a bitterness in her voice
steve senses the tension
peter just straps on his equipment
fran can i say something
what dp you mean
fran im sorry you found out im pregnant because i steve hey frannie come on
im not gonna be den mother for you guys
they all look at her attentive now
fran and i want to know whats going on
and i steve jesus fran
peter fair enough
whats goin on
peter were goin out
fran starts to say something but this time peter cuts her off
and you are not coming with us
again the woman starts to protest but peter continues
peter and you will not come with us until you can the big man starts back up the pyramid
roger moves to follow him
fran something else
the men look at her
she faces roger and peter directly without looking at stephen
fran i dont know anout you two but i wanna learn stephen is shocked
fran looks at him and lowers her eyes
fran if anything happens
weve gotta be able to get stephen doesnt know what to say
he looks at the woman then up at the other men
peter shes right flyboy
come on lets go
fran and youre not leaving me without a gun again
stephen thinks about protesting but he complies by slowly setting his rifle down on the cartons
then he fishes in his pocket for a fistful of shells and dumps them next to the gun
he stares at the woman angry and hurt
fran picks up the weapon and shoots a glance up at peter
fran i just might be able to figure out how to use peter and roger disappear through the skylight
stephen stands still
he looks down at the floor
fran moves close to his side
fran im sorry stephen
it is not an apology steve i know
he starts up to the skylight
fran stephen steve yeah
he stops and turns to look at her
her eyes are pleading for understanding but he is incapable of it at the moment
fran just shrugs off whatever she was going to say and she sighs with exasperation
fran be careful
steve yeah well be alright
he disappears through the skylight
fran stares down at the weapon in her hands then she steps over and clicks off the television
the sudden loud noise of the chopper engine as it hovers
only stephen is on board at the controls
in the cab of one of the big trailer trucks roger is crouching working on the wiring beneath the dashboard
peter sits on the cab of another truck
he tries the complicated shift mechanism and fidgets with the other controls
then he pulls out
he stops the big vehicle with his cab just abreast of the cab roger is working in
peter how about it
roger gettin it
peter looks around
the mall can be seen in the distance
on the ground between there are a few zombies scattered about in little clusters
none of them present any immanent danger
roger sits up and is able to start his truck
peter ill just ride pick up im not too sure of roger i grew up on one of these lets go
the great trucks lumber away from the warehouse
they pull across the little loading lot and out a ramp toward the roadway
stephen hovers overhead in the chopper following the trucks as closely as he can
on the roof of the mall fran clutches her rifle
she sees the big trucks roar up over the hill the helicopter just above them
it is a strange looking convoy as it speeds toward the trucks as closely as it can
along the road several zombies try to stagger after the trucks but they are left in the dust of the speeding vehicles
the creatures lumber along slowly behind
the vehicles pull into the little grade which loads into the malls parking lot
they roar right toward the building
at one of the building entrances a cluster of zombies is moving in and lot of the main doors
others wander nearby in the parking lot
attracted by the sounds of the engines the creatures turn and face the trucks
as peter pulls his vehicle in a wide arc roger drives his right up to the side of the building and roars toward the entrance doors
then he skips his right wheels up onto the curb and with a great scraping crunch the big truck pulls directly abreast of the building flush with the entrance
the huge vehicle crushes several of the helpless creatures and knocks other flying back
the trailer of the truck has totally blocked off the mall entrance
several zombies trapped inside try to push the glass doors open
the doors move but cannot be opened wide enough for the creatures to get out
the few creatures immediately around the truck begin clambering at its sides
roger shuts off the engine and grabs his gun as other zombies begin clutching at the windows of the cab
overhead the whirlybird hovers very close by
now peters big truck pulls up alongside so that peters passenger door is directly abreast of the free door on rogers cab
peters truck also crushes one or two of the creatures but there are still several in the immediate vicinity of the cab
as roger opens his door and scrambles into the other truck one of the zombies grabs hold
roger just manages to kick the creature off as the big truck pulls out and roars across the lot
the helicopter flies straight up and directly over the roof of the big shopping centre where fran has been watching the action
she now runs to the other side of the roof the wind from the chopper whipping her hair
the chopper turns and waits for the big truck to move up under it then the whirlybird escorts the trailer back to the warehouse down the road
roger is whooping and hollering like a cowboy as the big rig pulls up beside another of the parked vans
peter come on come on
three more baby
roger like a charm huh
like a fucking charm
roger grabs his knapsack and climbs into the new cab where he immediately goes to work on jumping the engine cables
from the helicopter overhead stephen spots something moving around the warehouse
he jockeys the chopper slightly for a better look and he sees a small group of zombies wandering out of the big garage directly toward rogers truck
in the meantime peters truck pulls away from the cab roger is in
the big vehicle rolls into the large paved area behind the warehouse where peter can turn it around easily
stephen swoops down with the big bird
he buzzes as close as he can to rogers truck trying to signal the man
roger continues to work on the cables still whooping like a child
the zombies are very close at hand
they have just about reached the cab
stephen buzzes again
roger doesnt notice
peter has now backed up into a position which enables him to pull out
he looks up to see the helicopter heading straight for him
the big chopper buzzes right over peters cab then spins around heading back for roger
peter looks toward the other truck
he can now see the lumbering creatures
he tries to slam the truck into gear but the complicated shift mechanism fights him
one zombie slams its hands against the driver side window of rogers truck
the man startles and tries to untangle himself from his cramped position under the big steering wheel
he is stuck for a moment
the other creatures appear at the passenger side of the cab where the door is open
one grabs at rogers legs
roger kicks violently but cant get a good position
he falls lower onto the floor of the cab his body almost knotted among the controls and the shift sticks
peters truck starts to roll but it accelerates slowly
the helicopter tries to buzz the clutching ghouls but they do not even flinch
the wind from the propeller blades whip at the creatures hair making them look even more frightening as they claw at the desperate roger
the man kicks and kicks but he cannot deliver a solid blow from his pinned position
his hand gropes on the seat of the truck for his rifle which suddenly fires as the mans fingers inadvertently hit the trigger
a shell blasts through the chest of the lead creature but the thing pays little attention
peters truck is starting to roll faster
he heads right for rogers cab
the helicopter hovers as stephen tries to see the action
now roger has a good grip on his gun but he cannot clear the long weapon from around the gear sticks
the lead zombie is actually scrambling into the cab and is all but on top of the struggling trooper
the second creature is about to claw its way in when with a great roar peters truck swings up and crushes it
roger is desperately trying to keep the other zombies mouth away
they are wrestling now
the zombie is weak as usual but roger is still hampered by the position he is in
peter has pulled too far past the other truck
he slams his rig into reverse and backs up
now his window is in a direct line with the open door on rogers cab
he raises his rifle and aims but he cannot get a clear shot
he shouts loudly trying to overcome the noise of the truck engine and the hovering helicopter
peter get its head up
get its head up
roger realises that peter is outside
he struggles with the creature dropping his gun
his hands manage to get a stranglehold on the creatures neck
he pushes up with all his might
the zombies hands are clutching at the mans face
its fingers push at the mans eyes
peter sees the opportunity and fires
the gun roars loudly
the zombies head flies apart
remnants of blood and brain tissue splatter the inside of the cab and the drivers window
the gummy stuff flies into rogers face
the zombie falls limp but roger is still desperate
the dead weight of the creature is now on top of him and the bloody wound runs
roger is frantic
he frees himself with great heaves of his body and he pushes the creature out of the cab
the mans eyes are wide with revulsion
he instantly brings up his sleeve to wipe the stains from his face
he is quivering in extremes of emotions
a sudden crash
the zombie at the driver door has smashed through the cab window with a brick
roger still shaking dives down to the floor for his weapon
peter tries to level off a shot but he cannot because roger is in the way
peter get down
i got it
roger in his adrenalised anger sits up with his gun and levels off on the creature himself
the shell crashes through the already shattered glass and squarely into the creatures head
roger you bastards
it seems as though his mind is snapping
his voice quivers as does his body
roger we got em buddy
we got em didnt we
peter cool it man
get your head
roger we got this by the ass
got this by the ass
roger is screaming
he dives down to work on the jumping again
peter hey rog
get your head man
there is no response from the other truck
peter is about to open his door and step out when suddenly roger sits up again
the engine of the truck roars
he seems to have calmed down some
he looks across at peter
roger lets go baby
peter you alright
roger perfect baby
roger guns the engine on his truck
the big vehicle lumbers out of the area
peter follows suit
the two semis rumble out of the warehouse lot and start down the grade toward the road
the helicopter escorts them
a few zombies are walking up the road slowly
rogers eyes get wider with anger
he steers his big rig right for the creatures
the front of the cab smashes into two of them
one is crushed under the wheels the other flies back from the impact
fran watches with anxiety
she sees the two trucks pull up over the rise with the helicopter following
we hear spirited music as the convoy approaches the mall building
the two trucks roar around the entrance ramps into the parking lot and again the chopper zooms right over the roof
fran trots across the roof to see the action in the lot
the trucks rumble toward the second set of doors
the music continues through the entire action
roger steers his giant vehicle directly broadside to the doors
the cab knocks over several creatures and scrapes the building as the trailer blocks off the entrance
this time there are still creatures alive in the immediate area
they clutch at the cab of the truck and leap at the doors
fran watching from directly above seems inspired caught up in the bravery of the moment
as she sees the creatures converging on the truck she aims her rifle at them
before she fires peters rig slides next to rogers cabs abreast
peters truck knocks over several of the clutching creatures
one zombie caught directly under the front wheels is still alive and clutching at the air
several creatures jump at peters driver side window
roger grabbing his gun moves to leave his truck on peters side but the trucks are too close
his door wont open enough to get out
he rolls down his window
peter has noticed rogers door wont open and the trooper fumbles with the gear shift in order to pull away but he hears roger shouting roger the windows
open your window
peter dives across the cab and rolls down the passenger window
roger leans out his open window trying to get his weapon into firing position
one or two zombies are squeezing through the narrow space between the truck
they are just about to reach roger when he fires killing the lead ghoul
more zombies move around rogers cab moments away from him
the helicopter buzzes the area as stephen watches the zombies converge on the cab
fran her hair blowing front he chopper tries to aim her rifle into the pack of creatures
her hair covers her eyes and she brushes it away with irritation
in front roger
in front roger
she shouts over the engine noises getting very excited
roger fires again and again down the narrow space between the rigs
another zombie falls
peter for chrissake come on
roger is still emotionally crazed
he leans out of his window in a very vulnerable position
he is whooping like a child again as he tries to level off another shot
suddenly hes grabbed from behind by a zombie and almost falls out the window
he struggles to hold himself and keep a grip on his gun
peter leans over trying to get a shot at the creature but cant get a clean sight
roger grabs the window frames on peters door and tries to pull himself up
another creature grabs him from behind
fran watches with emotion in her eyes
she fires her gun
the bullet slams into the pavement kicking up a cloud of smoke
it narrowly misses a creature
fran fires again
her shot tears into the shoulder of the zombie but it doesnt stop him
the chopper zooms very close
peter still cannot aim his rifle but roger using both hands brings his gun butt in an uppercut
it slams against a creature which is grabbing him and drives the thing staggering back
then with a desperate driving motion roger climbs through the window of peters cab
peter pulls the big rig away even while rogers legs still kick out the window
the zombies grab at rogers ankles and one manages to hold on as the truck starts to move
fran fires again and again
this shot rips into the zombie holding rogers leg
it lets go and falls rolling across the pavement
the woman fires again hitting the pavement
the creature struggles to its knees
she fires again and hits the creatures neck
the zombie sprawls on the pavement
fran is exultant she aims and fires at another creature
the helicopter passes overhead
the music is still stirring
in peters truck just rolling out the lot roger realises roger jesus
roger my goddam bag
i left my goddam bag in the peter brings his vehicle to a screeching halt
peter alright now you son of a bitch
you roger yeah yeah
suddenly peter grabs the trooper by his lapels and slams him back against the door of the cab
peter i mean it
now youre not just playin with the two men stare at each other for a moment
roger is startled somewhat out of his emotional rush
peter softer roger yeah
peter lets him go and returns to the wheel
he guns the engine and roars into a big arcing turn in the parking lot
when fran sees the truck returning she looks up from her gun sight
the helicopter has already flown over the roof and stephen is confused as to why the truck hadnt appeared on the road
fran turns and tries to signal to stephen
he finally sees her and flies closer
the woman waves a signal and the chopper buzzes back over the lot
her hair blowing wildly fran takes up her post again her rifle ready
she thinks a moment then begins to reload the weapon pulling the shells from her blouse pocket
peters truck zooms back into position colliding with some of zombies in the vicinity
roger immediately climbs through the windows into the original cab
he snatches up his knapsack and several tools which are strewn over the seat and floor
again creatures converge on the cab area
two more come up between the trucks several come around the front of the cab
fran is still loading
the helicopter buzzes
as roger climbs back through the window his pack accidentally falls to the ground
with reflex action he drops between the cabs landing on his feet
he is facing the two creatures which are very close
he reaches up and with on hand on each of the open window frames he swings his legs up hard
his kick sends the creatures sprawling
then he bends to collect his pack and is grabbed from behind
peter tries to level off his gun but he cannot get a shot
neither can fran who is shouting from the roof
roger keeps his head this time
his first thought is for the pack of tools
he tosses the sack into the cab of peters truck as though he were making a hook shot with a basketball
peter catches the pack as several of the tools clatter out and onto the floor of the cab
the creature which has a hold on roger takes advantage of the mans imbalance from throwing the knapsack
it bites at the mans arm
roger tears away but blood appears at the wound
then roger squares off a solid punch right to the zombies jaw
the creature flies back and almost knocks over the zombies behind it
roger jumps making a grab for the window of peters cab
the zombies between the trucks which roger originally kicked away have regrouped
they advance and grab at the struggling trooper
rogers feet try to get hold on the side of the door but they slip
peter moves to drop his rifle and grab rogers hands but roger falls from the high window back to the pavement
peter draws his hand gun
roger leaps again his hands catching the window frame
the zombies are clutching at him
again he swings up his legs and kicks the creatures off balance
this time he manages to get his feet locked against the door and peter grabs the troopers arm with his free hand but another zombie is pulling at the mans
shirt and still another makes a grab for his legs
peter reaches out with his pistol and fires a point blank shot at one of the clutching ghouls
it flies back and roger is able to pull himself higher
his torso is just about through the window when another creature grabs him
peter can no longer get a shot as roger fills the window so the big man drops his pistol and pulls rogers arm with all his might
roger is almost all the way in but his legs still dangle kicking
peter starts the truck
as it begins to roll away one of the clutching zombies is able to get a solid hold on rogers left leg
the creature opens its mouth and bites at the calf
the creature bites again and this time it comes away with bits of flesh tangled in a bloodstained strip op material from rogers trousers
roger screams in pain and kicks violently
the truck accelerates and the zombie finally falls clear
it rolls on the pavement for a little way before it stops
then it sits on the ground looking like a gorilla
it still has a bloody mass of flesh and material in its mouth
with its hands it tries to separate the cloth from the more important morsels
a bullet pings into the cement near the chewing zombie
another tears through its shoulder
it still is concerned only with its prize
fran is firing swearing through her teeth as the gun roars
she finally hits the seated creature squarely in the head
we see it fall from her point of view on the roof
others walk by the corpse without taking notice
the helicopter escorts the big truck back to the warehouse
as it rumbles along roger in extreme pain is tying his belt tightly around his leg as a tourniquet
he sucks air through his teeth in anguish
peter thats it
roger bull shit
peter we gotta deal with that leg
roger im dealin with it
im dealin with it fine
peter can you walk on it now
roger your damn right i can
damn right i can
the wounded trooper struggles to wrap the bloody part of his leg with a torn off piece of trouser
he can hardly keep from screaming and his words come out sharply and with great breaths between them
roger i stop movin this leg
may not ever get it goin the big black man stares at his friend for a moment
then he drives on to the warehouse escorted by the chopper
there is now a huge trailer truck at each of the four main entrances to the mall
they are very close to the doors if not completely flush
some of the glass portals can be opened not slightly but not enough for the zombies inside to pass through
in the parking lot the creatures mob around the trucks frustrated that they cannot pass into the building
they clutch and claw at the enormous vehicles but to no avail
some try to climb up onto the cabs
others try to claw at the doors on the trailers
some creatures are crawling under the rigs when they reach the mall doors they cannot stand so they have no leverage
the creatures inside are pushing the doors out so the zombies under the trucks cannot push them in
the doors swing both in and out so it is very clear that some access could be had by the creatures if they were more organised
one creature having crawled under a trailer does manage to push open a mall door
the thing crawls into the building through the legs of other ghouls which are trying to exit
they behave as a swarm of insects
the revolving door offers the best access for the creatures although its inherent complexity is baffling to their empty brains
two creatures do manage to crawl under the truck which blocks the revolving door and one of them negotiates the rotating action and enters the concourse
peter and stephen are huddled over the maps of the building
they are back in the crawl space
the cartons are still piled against the firestair entrance
peter it all depends on how many of them are still steve well if we can get some more flares
or maybe peter the guns are first
guns and ammunition
roger moans with pain
nearby fran is applying a dressing to his leg
the wound is wrapped with several layers of cloth
the first aid kit is open on the floor
peter crouches near his friend
he takes over from fran
he ties more strips tightly around the wound and around the upper thigh
peter you sure you gonna make it buddy
roger just hurry up with that
again the military music
a tall figure drops out of a ceiling grid and lands on the floor of the sporting goods store
it is peter
his rifle is slung and there is an empty pack on his back
several of the maintenance room key rings are strapped into his belt
suddenly a zombie charges across the room
the gate to the mall balcony is open on this store
another creature attracted by the commotion starts through the open entrance arch
stephen is starting down through the ceiling grid
he also has equipment strapped onto his body
he sees the charging creature
peter is trying to unsling his rifle
stephen conquers his fear of the height and lets himself fall to the floor
he crumples up when he hits and rolls into a store exhibit knocking things flying
peter manages to level off his gun and shoots the rushing creature
stephen regains his footing
the second creature is moving up the aisle
stephen grabs a powerful crossbow from a nearby exhibit
it is loaded
it fires with a strumming sound and the small shaft rips cleanly through the creatures skull and imbeds itself in a wall beyond
the zombie walks forward a few steps before it falls
the men run toward the entrance arch
leaping up on an adjacent counter top peter manages to reach the lip of the roll gate and he swings it down fast
stephen catches the cage below and slams it into place just as another ghoul falls against it moaning and clawing
stephen unslings his gun and is about to level it off on the creature outside
peter jumps down from the counter
peter dont try to shoot through those gates
the zombie crashes all its might against the metal cage
peter he cant get through
the men crash back through the store and peter moves right to the racks of weapons
he pulls down a gorgeous high powered rifle which is equipped with a sophisticated scope for sighting
peter aint it a crime
peter looking through the telescope the cross hairs of the telescope zero in on the enlarged forehead of the zombie which is thrashing against the roll gates
the sight gives up a sense of the super weapons lethal accuracy
stephen dives into the ammunition and moves behind the counter where he pulls out boxes of shiny new hand guns
peter finds elaborate holsters and ammunition belts
he pulls several other rifles from the rack
we recognise the firepower in the arsenal that the two men accumulate
other zombies appear at the gate but they cannot break in
peter at the creatures with a swell in the music the band of all four humans charges out of the maintenance corridor and makes a break for the department store
they all wear new double holsters containing hand guns
each has a rifle strapped over his shoulder and another in hand
they wear ammo belts and carry packs with other supplies
the wounded roger is sitting in the big gardening cart which peter earlier used to carry the first supply load out of the store
peter runs pushing the cart before him
there are only a few creatures on the balcony
the dead things turn in confusion at the sound of the attacking commandos
roger his hands free to shoot fires his weapon several times at some of the creatures who are closest
the creatures from the main concourse below begin to move up the stationary staircase and struggle with the escalators
the corpses of creatures slain in the earlier battles still clutters in the area
fran and steve are the first to reach the entrance to the department store
steve falls immediately on the gate locks
peter pulls up to a screeching halt at the gate
he turns the cart in a full so that roger is facing out toward the mall
steve fumbles with the second lock
peter faces the few zombies which are converging along the balcony
he lift his new super gun and stares through the scope
the gun roars eloquently
even its sound pronounces its power
the single shot rips cleanly through the centre forehead of one of the creatures
the man aims at another head
another perfect kill
then a third
roger fires several times
fran stands ready at the roll gate
as stephen finishes with the final lock the woman pushes against the cage and it starts up
steve stands and the two roll the cage into the ceiling but stephen is careful not to let it get out of his grasp
fran moves into the store and peter pulls the cart behind him
then steve peter and fran pull the gate shut long before any of the advancing creatures reach the area
again the zombies smash into the cage but the humans are already running through the aisles of the big store
peter wheels roger into the elevator and hits the button for the first floor
the doors shut and the car starts down
peter hows the ride
roger kind bumpy
the stern black face stares down at the back of the wounded mans head
despite his attempt at humour the stiffness in rogers body evidences his pain
peter puts his hand squarely on the troopers shoulder
peter look here
roger i know i know
something very serious is shared between the two men some knowledge which we do not fully understand
we do see the kind of bond shared by soldiers in a battle
the elevator doors glide open and peter pushes the cart out into the first floor on the big store
fran and stephen charge down the store escalator moving faster than the steps themselves
they run through the hardware department where stephen snatches up several propane torches
fran stuffs extra bottles of gas into her back pack
with a great hiss one of the propane nozzles spits a white hot flame as it is lit with a new disposable lighter
fran holds two torches as stephen lights them
peter steps up to the first floor entrance gate with roger in front of him
several creatures outside of the cage fly into sudden frenzy at seeing the humans
they slam against the grid but it holds as usual
peter unlock the middle one last
steve falls on the right hand lock with his keys
the zombies all converge near the crouching mans side of the gate
they push and shove
fran holds one of the lit torches very close and the creatures back away cringing
the lock opens and steve moves to the extreme left
again the zombies follow and again fran is ready with the torch
the toughest partll be gettin steve its a long haul down to the entrance
peter cranes his neck to see past the zombies and down the concourse
several other creatures are starting toward the department store
behind them about three hundred feet away is one of the main entrances which is blocked off outside by a truck trailer
peter well be alright
fran its too far
peter theres no backin out now
we gotta lock fran well never make all four
its too risky
steve you just stay here and be ready to upen up for us
fran the car
fran the car
outside we see the slowly spinning exhibit which displays the new automobile
it is a sleek sporty model which looks fast and manoeuvrable
peter looks down at roger
peter you ok to start it
roger nods and reaches for his supply pack
he is cringing with pain but he moves efficiently
the zombies clutch at the gate with new vigour
at the unlocked ends the grid gives a little but still holds the creature out
fran waves the torches closer and the creatures back away
steve un locks the middle lock
steve its goin up
the gate swings up with a thunderous roar
the zombies attack but frans torches make them hold back slightly
steve grabs one of the propane canisters with one hand and draws a pistol with the other
fran draws a hand gun also
the two fire into the pack of zombies
one or two fall
the others try to move in but are afraid of the bright flames
one gets close to steve but the man blasts his torch directly into its face
its hair catches on fire and the creature throws itself wildly about knocking other zombies back
now peter sees an opening and he makes a break with the cart
roger holds on to the sides
they crash through the scattered pack of ghouls successfully and peter makes for the car exhibit
there are a few creatures on the concourse on the carts path
peter shouting steve grabs the lip of the roll cage and it starts down
fran is still inside the store with one of the torches
fran the keys stephen
steve tries to stop the downward progress of the gate but it slams shut with a metallic crash
fran jesus christ
peter stops in his tracks when he hears the womans shouts
he looks back
several of the creatures have followed the cart
they advance slowly
several have stayed with stephen however and they approach stephen as he tries to pass the keys back through the gate
the big ring doesnt fit through the small openings
steve you mother
fran keep em
just keep em
the zombies at stephens back are very close
steve lunges at them with his torch
they back off slightly
peter come on man
get outa there
the creatures on the concourse are approaching the cart
a pained roger levels off several shots but he is very shaky from his extreme pain
he manages to down one of the zombies
for god sake
the woman holds up her torch so that the bright flame faces the ghouls
stephen crouches and puts a key in the right hand lock
the zombies converge on him
peter seeing other creatures drawing near starts to push the cart again
he manages to dodges two little clusters of the walking dead
the lock clicks just as one bold creature grabs stephen from behind fran tries to aim her torch closer
it disarms the zombie for a moment stephen thrashes his body back knocking the think off balance
then he quickly slides the keys under the gate which he can lift just high enough with the single lock undone
another ghoul grabs steve from behind
this time steves torch is knocked flying and rolls away
fran is desperate
she tries to aim her pistol but cannot shoot through the grill
she holds her torch high
steve kicks and scrambles rolling on the floor
the zombies are on him
he manages to knock one or two of them to the floor
then he fires with his pistol killing another he crawls to the torch and grabs it the creatures clutching and tugging at his pants and shirt
he brings the flame up and flashes it at the zombies
they back away enough for him to crawl to an open space
then he scrambles to his feet and charges down the concourse toward the car
at the exhibit peter stops the cart
there are two of the lumbering creatures close at hand
the big trooper raises his rifle
roger using all his strength manages to pull himself up out of the cart
he lips to the exhibit as peter fires at the oncoming ghouls
the super gun scores two perfect hits
as roger tries to step onto the spinning platform he falls and rolls against the car
the turntable carries him around toward another creature
he is struggling in pain toward the drivers door of the vehicle
steve who is approaching at a run sees the action
steve watch is roger
roger turns his head and sees the ghoul just before the creature grabs him
the things hands clutch at the wrapped wound which is already leaking blood through its dressing
roger screams loudly
peter jumps up onto the spinning turntable leans across the hood of the car
his super gun drills a hole through the creatures skull
it falls off the exhibit
peter hurriedly comes around to rogers side
in extreme pain the trooper is desperately trying to open the driver door
peter helps him
the door opens and peter eases his friend into the seat
roger immediately goes to work under the dash
zombies are advancing now from all over the concourse
peter get in
he is shouting at stephen who is just rushing up to the platform
he and the trooper scramble into opposite sides of the back seat
they slam the doors and make sure that all buttons are locked
roger works as quickly as he can
several of the lead creatures reach the turntable
some fall trying to step onto the moving disc but others manage to struggle over to the car
they smash the windows with their hands
it is a nightmarish scene as the men huddle in the shiny new car which spins very slowly in circles
fran has relocked the one open gate mechanism and she stands now trying to see the action but it is out of her line of vision
she can only hear the moaning of the creatures and pounding on the car
she turns the valve on her propane nozzle extinguishing the flame
the cars engine roars as roger is able to jump the wires
steve ill drive it
roger i got it
the troopers face contorts in agony as he moves himself into position behind the wheel
he is shaking but he bites his lip and slams the car into gear
there are at least eight creatures crawling over the car more approach
the platform spins
roger waits until the car is aimed directly down the concourse
the men in the back seats are alert to the zombies which pound at the windows
the ugly and distorted faces press close against the safety glass
now the car pulls out quickly
it rolls of the edge of the spinning display knocking several of the creatures aside
the front wheels move off the platform and bounce onto the floor but the frame of the car scrapes the top of the disc and is stuck for a moment
the disc spins on carrying the rear of the car with it
then roger gives it more gas
the rear wheels spin and finally catch
the car shoots out onto the mall floor
some of the zombies cling for a moment but they fall away quickly scrambling to regain their footing and follow
the car swerves and for an instant seems as though it will crash against the columns on the concourse
roger manages to control it and the shiny vehicle zooms ahead with tremendous energy
one of the stray creatures in the concourse tries to intercept the speeding auto but the car knocks him mercilessly aside as though he were a bowling pin
fran sees the car as it rounds the corner heads directly for the main entrance which she can see from her position
the zombies at the entrance already started back into the mall attracted by the commotion
the car zooms down the concourse easily breaking their ranks
roger throws the manoeuvrable vehicle into a screeching tailspin stopping just at the doors
the big trailer blocks the entrance effectively
there are some creatures inside the doors
under the van several zombies are struggling with the doors
one is just pushing in and seems as though it will be able to enter
peter and stephen slam against the door
stephen aims his torch directly at the crawling creatures
the one in front withdraws its arm
the grotesque things writhe kick under the truck
the door slams and peter produces another set of master keys
they are all coded
he falls on the lock mechanism
peter thats not but i dont think theyll get steve cant they smash the glass
peter safety stuff
they got steve rummages in his back pack
produces two portable battery operated burglar alarms
peter activates the units stands them against the base of the now locked doors
as he crouches near the glass creatures outside go into a frenzy clawing at the glass doors
they cannot get in
peter im hopin theyll just go away after they find the creatures moving slowly down the concourse are now getting close to the action
the men hop back into the car it roars off with roger still at the wheel
again the sleek auto rips through the ranks of the advancing zombies
they fall and scatter
the car speeds down the concourse turns the corner near where fran watches at the department store game
we hear steves voice on the womans walkie talkie
steve were ok
we got it made
fran stares out through the roll cage
the zombies are staggering weakly after the car
with another tailspin the auto pulls up at the second set of doors
the men scramble out of the back seat the zombies outside try to crawl under the second trailer
the men shut them out easily locking the door and planting alarms
they stand to look down the concourse
the creatures seem even more spread out now
steve how many you figure are already in
not too many
well get em easy
we the big trooper raises his super gun and sights through the telescope
as we see through the scope cross hairs settle on the forehead of one of the creatures which is lumbering down the hall
the face is magnified distorted by the telescope
the gun roars and the head in the scope explodes with red
the creature falls against a column hit squarely through the brain
we sense the supreme accuracy of the magnificent weapon
it is night
the zombies in the parking lot still group around the semis
they set up an eerie moaning in the moonlight
a slow piece of music starts to build
the creatures crawl under the trucks but cannot enter the mall
they pound and scratch at the doors to no avail
from inside the concourse the mob is muffled
even the revolving door is locked now
it seems the most vulnerable but the crawling creatures cannot quite get leverage to smash the glass panels and they have no tools to pound with
the auto is flush against the revolving doors inside offering added protection
several alarm units sit atop the car
they are the early warning devices against penetration
they camera starts to dolly back the music builds
we see slain corpses of many zombies lying askew in various parts of the building
it is like a battlefield after a war
the humans appear on the second storey balcony
moving to the railing looking down to the expanse of the building
they are guerrilla fighters with their weapons strapped on
they have taken the temple
the music hits a crescendo as the people look over their spoils
even the wounded roger seems triumphant as he limps to the rails supporting himself on his arms
we see a spectacular shot of the full expanse of the building
zombies lie dead everywhere
the humans have captures the gold of the gods
in this case the gods of consumer heaven
peters hand is on the maps of the maintenance corridor
he is drawing a line past the washrooms at the end of the hall near the firestair
peter we put up the wall here
theres no door from steve why cant we just board up the stairway
hell peter im not just worryin about them
sooner or they look back at the map
peter the ductwork runs all the way into the washrooms
the men sit huddled
the large storage area is filled with mounds of supplies brought up from the mall stores but the stuff all sits around in disarray
behind the wall of cartons roger seems to be sleeping but he is sweating feverishly and his face twitches
fran has been trying to soothe him with a wet cloth on his forehead
now she stops leaving the cloth on the shivering head
she moves out to stephen and peter
fran he seems to be sleeping
the woman moves to where she has medical supplies on one of the cartons
there are bottles vials and diabetic hypo syringes as well as bandages and dressings from the pharmacy in the mall
fran i dont know what else to do
steve youre doin fine
fran his leg is awful
the infection is spreading fast
steve looks at peter
the big trooper speaks softly
peter ive seen half a dozen guys get bitten by those fran is stunned
suddenly roger screams from behind the cartons
where are you
peter right here buddy
roger is sitting up
his eyes look very dark and sunken
he is sweating even more profusely than before
he licks his lips
he looks around the vast barren room trying to clear his eyesight
outside fran sits on a carton
the men are still huddled around the spoils
roger occasional shouts from the other room
roger we did it huh buddy
we whipped em
peter thats right rog
roger didnt we
didnt we whip em
peter we sure did buddy
roger we whipped em and got it all
we got it all
the mans voice sounds pathetic as it echoes through the big storage area bouncing off barren walls
a hammer slams into nails behind the fake wall which the people are working on
a great network of two by fours are braced at the rear of the corridor more lumber is wedged against walls making a frame
stephen is slamming large nails into the framework for reinforcement
on the frames face a masonite panel is nailed into place on one side
peter works in the corridor
he is carefully nailing in a moulding which makes the new partition look like a finished wall
in the corridor there are power tools lying about and a vast array of other hardware in the gardening cart
fran appears from out of the washrooms
she is carrying an old can of paint which has obviously been used
fran this must have been for touch up
it looks peter grabs the can and pries it open quickly with a screw driver
he dips his finger into the liquid and smears some onto the new wall where it butts against the corridor
it is a perfect match
steve to fran anything else you want before we close fran no
the woman is staring down the corridor toward the mall proper
the corpses from the hall have been carried out of the way
they are piled together at the corridor mouth on the balcony
it is a grisly sight
fran turns away
she steps back through the unfinished partition leans against the framework
her hand goes to her mouth as she tries to choke back a gag
steve moves up behind her but she feels another wave of nausea and she darts for the washroom
steve sets down his hammer and follows
the woman is kneeling on the floor propped up by her hands on the toilet seat
she is vomiting
steve approaches quietly
his hand falls on her back
fran leave me alone
its my problem
fran just get outa here stephen
i dont want you the man doesnt move
fran reaches up taking his hand
she clutches it tightly indicating that she is not angry
fran i dont want you to see me this way
another wave hits her and she wretches again
she pulls her hand back leaning over the toilet bowl
fran please go
stephen stands up reluctantly and drift out of the room
the woman wretches but she is dry
she tries to swallow
then sits on the floor next to the toilet holding her stomach
she fumbles with the flush handle depressing it
the rushing water makes an ugly sound
fran looks down at her stomach thinking of her pregnancy
stephen steps out of the unfinished framework
peter is gazing down the corridor at the pile of corpses
peter this place is gonna be rotten
we gotta flies buzz about the staring faces of the dead things on the balcony
peters hands are on the round hatch wheel of an enormous safe
peter theyre usually on a timer
open at the wheel spins and peter swings the giant door open
inside is a huge safety deposit vault of a bank
the men stand for a moment in awe
the clean walls are lined with drawers and doors where depositors have stored their valuables
at one end of the room there are stacks and stacks of paper bills
the men approach the piles of money stooping down
they each pick up packets of bills and flip through the edges
peter stuffs several packets into his knapsack
steve looks at him quizzically
peter you never know brother
steve takes several stacks and stuffs them into his kit
he looks about the enormous vault
steve dont ya wonder what the archaeologists are gonna peter thats exactly what it is now
we see the men wheeling gardening carts piled with corpses
the sombre image is shocking as the figures move in silhouette against the bright store fronts with their displays of goods designed to attract shoppers to the sweet life the
items pretend to represent
at the bank peter wheels a cart with several dead zombies through the lobby
in the vault the big trooper dumps bodies out on top of several others already deposited
the corpses lie askew their arms and legs protruding
the stacks of money are upset by the limp action of the bodies as they roll around
a finger flips a switch and we hear the mall music start up slowly
we see a montage fran stephen and peter walk slowly through the conquered building
they drift in and out of stores picking up various items
they use shopping carts
fran rummages idly through the cosmetic department
peter looks through a book store
stephen plays the pinball machines in a huge game room
peter tries on big colourful hats in front if a mirror
fran trims stephens hair as he sits in the mechanical chair of the mall barber shop
fran feeds the animals in the pet store then with a bag of seed she feeds the tropical birds in the tall cage out on the concourse
the birds flutter flap about screeching loudly
now the group walk along the upper balcony
they look down
they still have their weapons and kits peter is wearing a wide brimmed hat and fran sports a new mink coat
the concourse is empty now of corpses but the group can hear the moaning and thumping at the main entrances
it is dark outside the creatures claw at the doors but cannot be seen in the shadows under the big trailer trucks
the sound evidences their presence however
the people stand at the balcony railing overlooking their realm
fran theyre still here
steve theyre after us
they know were in here
peter theyre after the place
they dont know the noise at the entrance continues eerily
fran starts to be afraid
fran what the hell are they
peter theyre us thats all
theres no more steve what
peter somethin my grandaddy used to tell us
you roger is screaming wildly
he is sweating and his face looks sunken with an ashen colour
he thrashes about as steve tries to hold him
his leg is swollen almost all black
his arm which was also bitten is wrapped but oozing
steve get more valium in him
fran fumbles with one of the hypodermics but she drops the vial of serum and it shatters on the floor
steve get another one
roger is throwing himself about wildly
steve barely manages to hold on
fran rushes into the other room
the space is starting to look like living quarters
there is furniture
there are sectioned off areas with things still packed in cartons but it is beginning to look like home
the woman rushes to the medical supply area which is now more organised with little cabinets and a small refrigerator
she takes a new vial of serum from the freezer
downstairs peter is checking the covering at the floor base of the fake wall
he hears the violent screaming from above
he climbs up a rope ladder in the ceiling scrambles through the grill in the ceiling enters the duct
then he pulls up the ladder and closes the grill
he crawls through the tight space for a few feet and drops out of another grill into the washroom
he moves through the internal corridor and into the firestair
all the while rogers screaming can be heard
peter tramps up the stairs several at a time
he rushes through the living space in the direction of the screams
fran is withdrawing a hypodermic from rogers good arm
the man still thrashes wildly
steve is struggling to hold him
peter rushes in and helps
fran drifts out of the room
after a short time roger relaxes somewhat
peter to steve go on
ill stay with him
steve leaves the area
in the living spaces fran is sitting in a chair
it is the inflatable kind which can be collapsed like a balloon
steve comes up to her and puts his arms around her neck from behind
she cups his hands with hers and holds them tightly
she stares off across the room
roger catches his breath and looks up at peter
he licks his lips and tries to speak coherently
youll take care of me right peter
peter i will
roger i dont wanna be walkin around like that peter
the mans eyes are terrified
he looks this way and that at the walls the ceiling at peter
he cant focus
peter im here trooper
roger youll take care of me
i know you will
peter i will
peter yeah brother
roger peter dont do it
til your sure
sure im comin later the moon shines down through the skylight in the living area
a sturdy ladder has now replaced the pyramid of cartons up to the open hatch
stephen fiddles with the television
there is a faint signal coming in
he has the set wired to a makeshift antenna which stretches through the skylight
a table lamp sits on a small end table and is lit
its cable is patched into a network of wiring which stretches about the room
fran is unpacking things
she is stacking dishes and silverware
it is a very orderly scene
the couple looks like a pair of newlyweds who have just moved into a new house
on the television two men are talking a commentator and an official of the government
the scientist is in a suit but his tie is rumpled and his collar open
he has not shaved and he seems very tired and nervously upset
scientist ive got to
be careful with words here
their need versus
scientist versus the amount of food available
lets be blunt
there is a commotion in the tv studio
we hear noises and shouting as we did j
steve jesus christ
he squats near the set staring
fran comes up behind him
scientist project out their rate of growth
theres a comm
what are you proposing
scientist we have to be unemotional
we have to provide comm
scientist they cant control the rate of growth and con comm
youre suggesting that we help them
scientist by helping them in this case we save ourselves
a great outcry is heard in the studio
the camera bobbles around
the scientist is fumbling for words
stephen good god
in the other room peter sits against a wall
he can hear the television
his eyes stare straight ahead at something
scientist im proposing that certain
necessary measures the camera pulls off peters face
we see that his rifle is stretched across his lap
the tv drones on from the other room
scientist in co operation with the mobile units of the o
we see now what peter is staring at
on the floor twenty feet away lies the corpse of roger
its face is covered with a blanket
it lies very still
scientist this collection
the mans voice is heard almost shouting over the voices from the studio
the angry staff protests vigorously with emotional language
scientist this collection could be
the shouts of anger continue
suddenly the dead rogers foot seems to move under the blanket
peters eyes pick up the movement immediately
his hands tighten on his weapon
scientist the dissection
the dissection of the corpses can rogers arms seem to move in slight twitching motions
the commotion in the studio reaches a fever pitch
from the movement beneath the blanket starts to creep down off rogers face
peter stares with fascination and disbelief
the blanket clears the blankly staring eyes
the drooling mouth
roger tries to sit up peters hands click a shell into his super gun
suddenly the corpse sits up
it stares at peter blankly at first then with purpose
it starts to move towards the trooper who calmly raises his weapon
on the tv the commotion still rages
stephen and fran stare at the tube hardly believing what they see
the scientist is shouting above the din
he is nervous
he wipes his brow with his sleeve
scientist weve got to remain unemotional
steve theyre crazy
fran its really
all over isnt it
the loud roar of peters gun from the next room
fran startles and falls into stephens arms
rogers corpse is dumped on top of the stack of bodies in the bank vault
his eyes stare with a puzzled expression
the arms and legs of the other bodies make the room look like a renaissance painting of hell itself
there is the familiar gunshot wound in rogers forehead
the heavy door of the vault closes with a metallic slam which echoes through out the mall
a small puppy lifts its leg and urinates on a table
the womans hands reach into frame and grab the little animal
she carries it through the room and drops it on some papers laid out in an unused part of the storage area
frans stomach is big now her pregnancy evident
she wipes her brow like an exhausted housewife and shuffles back into the living area
she fumbles with the sheets on the double mattress which she and steve obviously share
there is an end table near the bed with a reading light
books lie strewn around along with magazines and half drunk cups of coffee
in the sitting room we see a scene which could be comfortable suburban
the furniture is neatly arranged
there is a small portable stove which operates on bottled gas a refrigerator and cabinets with dishes and silverware
there is a modern calendar on the wall which has three months crossed off
there are a variety of radio and tv units and a stereo record player
there are even decorations paintings hung knick knacks on the tables
the room almost looks like a wealthy mans den with all the gadget oriented affluence
in the department store stephen wanders about
he fiddles with a new supersonic calculator and he looks at adult games
on the roof in the bright sun of early morning peter plays tennis against one of the shed walls
hes dressed in a new sweat suit with brightly coloured addidas sneakers
he has a sleek new racquet slamming phosphorescent balls with all his might
his face is set in what is almost anger
he attacks each shot with determination and emotion
one of his shots misses the shed
the ball bounces and banks off the lip of the roof then it tumbles over the edge
in the parking lot below the ball hits the pavement
it bounces several times rolling off among the feet of the army of zombies wandering this way and that through the area
the creatures mob around the trucks at the main entrances
they moan and gurgle clawing at the building
there seem to be hundreds of them all different ages sexes shapes
some clothed some naked some wounded some almost untouched
now fran the pregnant housewife is cooking supper
the men play cards with hundred dollar bills in the living space
the three sit around the dinner table just finishing their supper
the tv set is on but only grey snow fills the screen and the speaker hisses as it receives no signal
fran there hasnt been a broadcast for three days
steve they might come back on
fran angrily throws down her silverware and stomps over to the tv
she clicks it off
the woman returns to the table
steve stands up and moves to the set
he clicks it back on
peter watches the two sheepishly
it is a domestic scene
the group has become a family with all the disadvantages of comfortable living including the inability to communicate
fran what have we done to ourselves
the thunderous roar of the helicopter engine
the machine is hovering over the roof of the mall
fran is at the controls
steve sits in the passenger seat
steve ok now easy
bring er down
the whirlybird starts down for the roof
it is somewhat unstable but it eases down regularly
in the cockpit a flustered fran manages to handle the controls
the woman reacts efficiently
she handles the controls better as the choppers runners are just about on the roofs surface
steve thats it
you got it
the runners hit the roof surface and the chopper settles
fran throws her arms impulsively around stephens neck
steve you did it
you did it hon
you did it
the woman excitedly hugs and kisses stephen with childish joy
she is bubbling
seen from a great distance the helicopter atop the mall looks very small
its engine dies and begins to whine
a pair of binoculars is watching the action
the lenses pull away from a pair of beady eyes
voice they must get in through the roof
voice son of a bitch
voice theres trucks blockin all the entrances
voice no sweat
voice what do ya think
hit em now or wait voice tonight
we see the short wave radio speaker installed in the living space near the tv
a voice rattles over the unit voice we know youre in there
seen the whirlybird fran steps to the doorway attracted by the signal
peter sits at the radio not knowing whether to send
voice hey er
could ya use some company in there
steve is about to say something
peter stops him
voice were just ridin by
we could sure use peter listens intently trying to read the voices inflections
voice how many of you in there anyway
theres peter raiders
fran well they know were here maybe we should
peter cutting her off the little puppy scrambles up to frans feet seeking attention
she picks the little dog up in her arms
fran well if theres only three of them
peter who says
theres a long silence
the radio sputters static
voices are heard but they arent speaking into the microphone
they are obviously conferring among themselves
steve starts to speak peter cuts him off
he is trying to hear the muffled conversation
fran i think we should
peter jesus christ shut up and listen
slight laughter is heard
steve looks into peters face
the bug trooper just stares at the speaker without moving
finally the voice again
you in the mall
you just fucked up instantly peter grabs his weapon and straps on his holster
peter come on man
get it up
under the cover of darkness a pair of hands stores a microphone on a portable radio unit
the radio is in a small van which is cluttered with junk
an arsenal of weapons is strewn about
we see several men and a few women huddling inside the van
they look like banditos
one even wears a mexican sombrero
the men are armed to the teeth wearing ammunition belts criss crossed on their chests
they are dirty and sloppily dressed in all sorts of surplus clothing
outside in close up shots hands turn controls on big motor cycles and feet stomp accelerators
the bikes roar creating a thunderous sound
clouds of dust and fumes rise into the air
peter and stephen are running across the mall roof
the roar of the cycles can be heard in the distance
reaching the roofs edge peter stares off at the horizon but sees nothing
the thunder draws nearer
peter tries binoculars
through the lenses are vague shapes in the darkness
as the sound swells we see the riders
their powerful bikes come charging over a rise
then three more
they are accompanied by two small vans
there are at least fifteen bikes
the sound is deafening
peter just three huh

the men charge down through the skylight
the roar of the convoy can now be heard in the living space
fran is desperate
steve rushes by her with peter who crashes on ahead through the door onto the firestairs
fran whats happening
steve theres fifteen or twenty of em
steve were just gonna shut the gates
the man disappears through the stairway door
fran drops the puppy which goes running after the men floppily
fran thinks to chase the dog but instead moves to the storage area and snatches her weapons
she starts to load her rifle
outside the convoy makes a pass at one of the trucks
in the darkness the zombies clutch at the fast bikes
the raiders fire their guns dropping several of the creatures
the mob of creatures is impenetrable at first
the raiders leader signals the convoy to drop back across the parking lot
some raiders have trouble keeping balance as zombies claw them
the lead bikes pull up on the other side of the lot
raider theyll spread out comin after us
the other bikes ride to the leaders
a van pulls in and two bikers scramble aboard through the side doors
one of the women jumps into the drivers seat and revs the engine
the zombies are starting to move out after the convoy
the mob at the mall entrance is thinning somewhat
in the mall peter drops from the grill in the exterior corridor
he charges out and into the maintenance corridor where he breaks for the mall proper
he is followed by stephen
peter shouting steve ok
peter got your talk box
peter keep is handy
outside the raiders van revs and roars towards the mall
the bikers stay at the other side of the lot engines idling
some of them whoop and holler like american indians
the van crashes through the advancing zombies
several of them are knocked flying
the vehicle pulls up to the truck cab
three men pile out and scramble into the truck
the zombies in the area clutch at the raiders but they fight their way clear
the woman in the van revs the engine again
zombies claw at her window
she squeals back to the main biker group
the zombies in the parking lot are approaching the ranks of motorcycles from a good distance
the raiders open fire
they too possess sophisticated weapons the barrage sets up a great noise
several creatures fall
the little van pulls up behind the bikes
the men still whoop and shout
on the floor on the mall peter and steve dash about slamming roll gates down on the open stores
they run desperately through the empty concourses
they hear the din from outside
at the trailer cab a raider fires point blank at the zombies that claw at the passenger window
another man checks cables
its still taped up
its all ready the man sits at the wheel revving the engine
ghouls at windows
inside the men hear the truck starting
steve slams down the pharmacy gate
peter is already running to the department store
the big trooper crashes up the escalator to the second floor aisles
steve breaks for the open hardware store
the huge trailer rolls away from the mall entrance
a shout of victory goes up from the raiders
the zombies at the door do not yet enter the mall their focus on the raiders now
from other entrances zombies start converging on the parking lot
across the lot the bikers rev their engines ready to make a run on the building
the raiders in the truck hop from the cab
they run to the doors shooting zombies at they move
some creatures fall others claw at the runners
one raider is brought down by the ghouls
his friends pay no attention
one gunman slams into the mall doors to find they are locked
he levels his machine gun on the locks and rips open the mechanism
the men push through the doors
the little alarm units are knocked flying sending out a high pitched signal
peter is just slamming down the gates on the balcony when he hears the alarms go off
one of the raiders hears the gates rumbling
he looks up and sees peter running by the railing upstairs
he fires with his machine gun
peter dives sliding across the balcony
the bullets miss him and he crawls around the balcony just out of sight from below
steve has just slammed down the hardware store gate and makes a dash for the department store
the raiders spot him as well and open fire
steve runs zip zag and dives into the big store where he ducks into the shadows leaving the gate open
peter at the balcony railing levels his super gun on the bikers
one accurate shot fires and a raider falls with a giant wound in his chest
the last raider at the doors ducks out of peters sight
steve now charges the roll gate and slams it shut on the store
the bikers toward the building
zombies scatter on the lot
just as the bikers are reaching the building the raider inside rushes the doors
he holds them open as the big fleet of rumbling cycles comes screaming into the building
steve is in awe watching from the department store grid
the cycles pull down the concourse and zombies lumber in after them
the raider at the door is grabbed by a zombie
he manages to fight away
peter shooting above downs the raider and one of the ghouls
the main band of bikers hear the gunfire and pull down a side concourse to regroup
they make their turn close to the department store and steve backs into he shadows
peter moves down the balcony as zombies are clamouring back to the big concourses
peters eyes are wide at the invasion
upstairs fran hears the noises
she is at the top of the firestair weapons ready
on the landing below the puppy scamper and barks
fran calls the dog but it doesnt listen
the bikes arc around and several pull up to the dept
couple of you hold off them zombies
the leader rolls out
peter fires and drops a raider his bikes flying into the approaching zombies
the action is too fast and furious
neither peter or steve can see the whole layout of the concourse
the lead bikers pulls out of range behind a set of columns
a couple of bikers dismount and start up the stationary stairs
steve talks into his walkie talkie steve theyre comin up peter
theyre comin peter moves to another spot on the balcony
suddenly the raiders at the dept
store door turn a machine gun on the roll gate locks
one flies open
steve runs into the store about to charge up the escalator when he realises hell be in the line of fire
he runs to the elevator hits a button and starts for the second floor
peter fires and drops one of the charging men on the balcony
the other takes cover
just as peter is changing position the lights in the building blink out
the escalators stop
the power has gone off
upstairs fran is alone in total darkness
below she hears the puppy still barking
she starts carefully down the steps
in the stuck elevator steve gropes and fumbles for his talk box
the big trooper charges through the darkness to the maintenance corridor ignoring the buzzing on his talk unit
the raiders on the balcony approach quickly ducking against the walls occasionally for cover
the other bikers spill into the dept
store raiding the counters and raping the displays
they throw things into sacks while others move to different stores and shoot off roll gate locks
they raid the arsenal in the sporting goods store
the main pack of bandits are holding off the zombies
the creatures charge with new vigour
some raiders fall and the ghouls pounce on them ripping flesh with teeth and hands
the van pulls up outside the doors and two bikers ride out to it loading supplies into it
the zombies are everywhere but the actions of the professional looters befuddle them
several creatures move onto the balcony
one zombie pounces the raider peter shot and tears at his body
as remaining raiders appear at the mouth of the corridor peter opens fire killing the lead raider with a clean shot in the heart
the man flies back over the railing falling to the concourse below where zombies attack it
the other raider falls back against the wall
peter dashes into the maintenance room and rushes to throw the emergency power switch
the portable emergency light units blink on all over the mall
steve who has crawled through the escape hatch of the elevator suddenly feels the car move
he grabs onto the cables but his hands slip from grease and his rifle falls down and wedges between the wall of the shaft and the moving car
suddenly the car stops again and steve sees through the escape hatch as light spills in as the main elevator doors open
he thinks to jump down but hears raiders below
two of the big greasy bandits charge into the car
they whoop and shout as they see the open escape hatch
steve settles back out of sight against the wall
raider come on man
the other raider whoops loudly and fires a barrage of bullets into the escape hatch
the shells bang and clatter in the shaft and ricochet off the walls and gears
a shell nicks stephens arm but he is silent
finally the barrage stops
the raiders charge back to the store
other bandits battle with zombies
the men crash through stores collecting weapons ammunition tools clothes food
bikers shuttle goods out to the side doors of the van
the woman in the front seat is ready with giant pistols
zombies try to pound their way in but they cannot succeed
in the mall another biker drops to the zombies
they pounce on him and start devouring his screaming body
several creatures now wander through the department store having entered from the second storey gate
they move through aisles knocking against displays
one grabs a mannequin thinking it human throws the dummy aside roughly
the raider on the balcony is approached by several zombies
he runs down the corridor to the maintenance office
peter is gone
breaking into the various empty offices the raider comes to the fake wall panel and assumes it goes nowhere
then he hears the faint barking of the dog
he checks the panel again by running his hand along the edge
suddenly a sound in the corridor and the raider turns
there are three ghouls coming
he fires and knocks off the ghouls one at a time and runs onto the balcony
bikes roar this way and that
it is a war zone
the man is about to run downstairs when he hears a noise above
he spins and looks up
he sees peter just too late
the big trooper in an open ceiling grid aims his super gun squarely at the raiders head
the gun roars and the man flies
below the raiders are starting to regroup
the bikes begin to peel out of the mall entrance one at a time
another raider is snatched off his machine by the zombies
the bikers toss a last bit of booty in the van and the woman driver gets ready to pull out
she lowers her window and fires point blank at the heads of the clutching creatures
the last wave of raiders is at the first floor entrance
the zombies are mobbing around the bikes outside
the men shoot and beat their way to the cycles
one man is brought down but three manage to mount their cycles
the big bikes roar out
peter is crawling through the ductwork
just as he opens a grid he sees the last bike rolling across the concourse
he levels off with his scope
he shoots one raider out of the saddle
two others get out
regrouping in the lot the band of twenty is now seven or eight
one last cyclist revs his engine and roars through the concourse
he dodges several ghouls and heads for the entrance
he is the leader
the one who was on the radio
he whoops victorious just as he is about to drive through the doors
peter leans out of the grid work and settles the cross hairs on the back of the riders head
he waits as the biker roars out onto the lot
the rider lets out one last victorious shout in the fresh air
peters scope is locked on the riders back and the super gun roars
the biker is blown off his machine
the bike flies into a pack of zombies
some fall back but others advance on the rider
the man rolls over the cement stops not dead yet
he screams wildly as they move onto him
the other bikers move off in the night and the engines fade away
the puppy stops barking
fran is tense in the darkness clutching her rifle
she stands on the now silent landing
in the parking lot and main concourse the zombies move freely
they fight over the remains of the corpses
they eat ravenously the sounds of their feast the only thing in the area
peter peers down at the slaughter below from the ductwork
suddenly he hears the beeper of his talk unit hits the button
peter where the hell are you
steve in the elevator
peter listen those things are all over the place
peter starts to crawl through the ducts
steve hits the second floor button and the car moves
he clamours up on the hand rail on the car
his hands reach up and grab the escape hatch pulling his head and shoulders out the opening
he kicks with his legs to force himself up when the car stops
he sees the grid in the shaft wall
suddenly the car doors open on the second storey and abruptly several zombies dart into the car
they claw at steves legs and pull him out of the hatch
he screams thrashes violently
in the duct peter hears the screams
he stops and listens for a moment
he backs away heading for the maintenance corridor
in the elevator steve thrashes with all his might
the ghouls try to pull him out of the car while the elevator doors open and close repeatedly against the creatures which block it
a zombie bites steves arm another bites his neck
the man scrambles to unholster his gun
although he is bleeding profusely he finally pulls his gun and fires
peter is dropping out of the washroom duct
he hears the pistol shots and realises steve is not dead
he thinks about climbing back in the grid but stops
he punches at the wall violently
he is angry and confused
again the pistol roars and rips through a zombie head flying out of the elevator
the doors still slam against the last creature and steve fires
the zombie flies back and the doors finally close
outside zombies fall against the elevator doors
inside steve falls to the floor
his neck runs red
his eyes are wide with terror
he sits stupidly staring at the pistol in his hand
he finds it hard to breathe
peter appears at the bottom of the firestair
the puppy runs to meet him tails wagging and yapping
he hangs his head as fran looks down
she runs down the steps
the big trooper catches her bodily as she is about to charge out into the hall
peter i heard his gun
maybe hes alright
well the mall stands silent in the blue haze of impending dawn
zombies move through the building freely walking the halls lumbering through the stores
several creatures still pound and scratch the elevator doors
as they push each other one creature inadvertently makes contact with the elevator call button
the doors glide open
steve is standing his blood dry now
his eyes are blank as he steps forward
the creatures step away seeing that he is no longer prey
he is among them now
the doors slam against steve and open again
steve lumbers into the store down the aisle
other creatures drift away
upstairs fran is packing her sack slowly and ponderously
her face is red from crying
peter stands at the stair top looking down at the landing
fran sets the sack down at the escape ladder leading to the roof
she deliberately goes to fill another sack
on the mall balcony stephens corpse walks to the maintenance corridor
he looks past other wandering zombies and sees the fake partition
something in him remembers
he moves forward
fran its almost light
peter looks at her silently from the stairway door
fran he doesnt answer the radio
its been hours
she starts to cry again
fran for god sake
you better come on because if the puppy suddenly growls
it charges between peters feet and runs floppily down the steps
in the hallway steve pounds at the fake wall
other creatures notice and they all move toward the partition
upstairs the pounding can be heard
peter stands stoically looking down into the darkness
the dog barks below
fran what is it
peter its stephen
theyre comin up
with a great crunching noise the partition gives way from the army of creatures
peter slams the door
he speaks quietly
peter go on
you get out of here
peter i said
get out of here
from the firestair we hear the sudden yelping of the puppy as it falls victim to the creatures
the sound echoes through the barren spaces of the storage area
fran oh jesus peter
peter i dont want to go
i really dont
suddenly the door flies open and the creatures lumber into the living space
peter stares at them
he smiles slightly
the creatures advance led by stephen
fran starts to scream
she makes a slight move for her lover but peter raises his super gun and shoots the zombie through the head
as stephen falls fran comes up short
the act startles her into awareness
peter faces her as the creatures come up behind him
peter move woman
fran grabs the sacks and climbs the ladder to the roof
the creatures advance on peter
he backs away trying to lead them from the skylight
they crash through the living space upsetting the carefully planned room
on the roof fran desperately starts the helicopter engine
peter backs into the storage room slamming the door
the creatures approach the door and the super gun roars one last time
the zombies push through the door and move in for their feast
several zombies manage to scramble up the skylight to the roof
fran stares transfixed
the blades roar up to full speed
the creatures advance toward the machine
fran steps out onto the running board the creatures very close now
she crouches watching for a moment then looks up at the spinning blades
she stands straight up driving her head into the spinning blades
a headless form falls to the roof
the zombies advance
in a wide shot silhouetted against the dawn sky we see the creatures huddled under the chopper blades feasting on their last victim
the credits crawl up
just as the credits end
the engine of the helicopter sputters
